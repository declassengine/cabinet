         [Memorandum circulated by the Minister of Reconstruction)                                                       16 NOV1918         On the 11th March, 1915, the Local Government Doardissued a circular to Local Authorities with reference to theorganisation of labour and the rostriction of expenditure whichwas nocossary in the then existing circumstances,   In thecourse of this circular the Local Government Board said:-        &quot;Moreover, it is essential to see that capital as    well as labour is made available in the directions in which    it can best further the national interests during the war,    and, ac you arc no doubt aware, the Lords Commissioners of    His Majesty^ Treasury have decided to restrict capital    issues by Local Authorities, as well as by public companies,    within the narrowest limits,.        &quot;After the termination of the Ti&quot;ar, when the men re-    turn from the Army and when the war contracts ccaso, it is    possible that the question of unemployment may again become    acute,   The schemes for now works and buildings, which    ho.vo been or aro being prepared, would then be of the    greatest value, and undertakings, which aro now reluctantly    postponed owing to the need of economising both &quot;japital    and labour, could then be carried into effect with double    advantage&quot;,          Since March, 1915, and up to tho proaont time, localauthorities have been prevented from borrowing money for the inception of any now works except such as wore of pressingnecessity, cither for reasons of public health or on account ofwar requirements., these terms being construed in their strictestsense.   Tho only exception to this rule is the case of loans for the purchase of land for housing schemes.   At present theLocal Government Board are authorised to sanction loans forthis purpose up toatotal sum of  50,000.   This means thatloans can only be sanctioned for small purchases and for thepayment of deposits in respect of some of the large purchaseswhore no arrangement for deferring  completion of purchase canbe made with the landowner.         Tho Local Government Board have already written to theTreasury asking that the embargo on loans for the purchase ofland for housing schemes should be entirely removed, but it now seems to be necossary to go&apos; much further and to obtain a relaxation of the present restrictions in regard to borrowingby Local Authorities, not only for building schemes but also for other public works,   Until the existing restrictions arorelaxed it will bo impossible for the Local Authorities tomake any substantial progress with the schemes which it may&quot;be necessary to put in hand to absorb unemployed labour-.
          The Local Government Board arc not unmindful citherof the calls upon the National Exchcquor or of the claims ofindustry, and accordingly they do not suggest tho completeremoval of the present, restrictions.  Thoy would propose,however, that tho restrictions on capital issues should be sorelaxed as to allow borrowing for such purposes as arc cntitlodto priority in the work of reconstruction.  In other words itis suggested that the Treasury should now allow tho borrowing ofmoney for schemes of public utility and for the purposes of the key industries of the country,          Quito apart from the question of directly providing employment, the execution of public works of various kinds bylocal authorities is of outstanding importance to industry,For example, a number of Local Authorities arc prepared to putin hand electricity schemes which arc needed for supplying force to factories.  Others (c.g. Manchester, with a  2,000,000scheme, Eirkenhoad ani Sheffield) arc ready with large schemesof water supply which are just as vital to the manufacturers cfthose towns as to the domestic consumers.  Swansea has a bigsewerage scheme involving an expenditure of close upon a million,And so on,          Action in the above direction is urgently necessary.Tho Local Government, Board have Informed Local Authorities thatin order to avoid unnecessary delay they are prepared to- examineat once any proposals that may be submitted to thorn by a LocalAuthority and if found satisfactory to bring them to tho point at which sanction can readily be granted as soon as circumstances permit.  In a number of cases this procedure has already booncompleted and the works c?vn be put in hand as soon as thepresent restrictions arc withdrawn.  In many casds, howovor, itis feared that the Local Authorities will be slow to move until they arc assured that on receiving approval of their schemes the necessary money will be available for putting them into execution.          Unless the Treasury are prepared to make an oarlyannouncement on this question to reassure the Local Authorities,there will be a serious risk of nullifying the efforts which thoLocal Government Boartd have made to encourage the inception ofschemes for new works and buildings which would, directly  and indirectly, assist in tho absorption of labour in thotransition period of war to peace.          It should perhaps be added that in tho case cf LocalAuthorities it is not tho practice to raise the whole of thecapital required before tho works are began, but increly toraiso from time to time such amounts as arc needed to defray theexpenditure which is actually incurred.          The Irish Office aro in agreement with these proposals and the Scottish Office concur but indicate one point on which  a difference of administrative treatment may be required.  InScotland there is not tho same statutory control over municipaland other local loans as exists  in the English Local GovernmentBoard.  Presumably somo control will bo required, oven if  theTreasury see their way to assont generally to  the proposedrelaxations, and it may therefore be necessary that the temporarycontrol over leans exercised by  the Scottish Office, in consultationwith the Treasury, during the war, should for  a time be continued.
