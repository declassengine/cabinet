     I circulate a cop;/ ox a letter which has been addressedto.- the, Ministry of &quot;-ahour by the Office of Dorics and I should \\he glad to have the &apos;7ar cabinet.net a decision on the point raised as 30011 as possible.     I think that the difficulty will not arise in many important oases as regards polling booths or counting places.The polling can, as a rule, tav:e place in public elementary schools and the counting in Town Halls and other MunicipalBuildings,   The difficulty, however, is a real one as regardspart; meetings .   In Liverpool, for example, the ,it. George&apos;aHall and in Dublin, the old Corn &quot;ji:ehange are probably the onlysuitable buildings for the purpose of this Ministry.     If such places are requisitioned, the difficulties of candidates may be increased but all pa:rtioe would be equallyaffected and as, in the present circumstanoes,  the use of thebuildings for demobilisation purposes ia urgently requiredI would suggest that, where no other course is  open, thehalls should be commandeered.     It is desirable to note that certain newspapers havealread/ sup. ested that hall?, are to be commandeered by the  /Government, ostensibly for demobilisation, but  really toprevent their use by candidates.(Signed)  Geo.  H,  Roberts.

QPriO^  OP  WORMS,  -Jeply to  this letter  ah..uld              Storeyte  Gate,I  the above number, and must  be            Westminster,  S. hitIseed to  -   &quot;The Secretary,&quot;                 19th November,  1918.  -      H.J&apos;.I.  Office  of 7orks,         Storey&apos;s  Gate,            Westminster,  S. 7.1.                       BY HAKT).ISir,       I am directed by  the  First  Commissioner  of His Majesty1 a   Works, etc.,  to  state, for  the information of  the Minister  of   labour,  that,  in the process  of  obtaining  premises for   demobilisation purposes, difficulties have arisen and willI   continue  to  arise,&apos;from the  fact that Halls and other local   buildings,  which would bo  suitable for  the purposes of the  Ministry  of  Labour,  are to  be used for  polling booths or   counting,  or  for party meetings  in connection with the   General Election.    This difficulty  will practically  preventI   this Department from obtaining the use  of  certain Halls,  etc  by agreement,  and  when the Defence of the  Realm (Employment  Exchange) Act  1918 comes into force  and regulations are  made enabling  the  Commissioners  of Works to commandeer premise  for demobilisation purposes,  an  important  question of policy  will require  to be settled.   The First  Commissionerj  therefore   suggests  that  the  position  should be put to the War Cabinet by   the Minister  of,Labour without delay, in order that theI definite  instructions  of the  Government may be obtained and  the necessary  measures may  be taken  to  ensure the carrying  through  of  the programme of  temporary promises.                       I  am, Sir,                           Your obedient  Servant,:.                               (Signed) Lionel Sarle.
