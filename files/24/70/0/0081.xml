S3 Q RB, T,,5^.6370^        WJ^K____JLiJULILILJLi       The employment of persons not wholly of                   British extraction.         I oironic to the following memorandum by Sir ThomasHeath for consideration by tho iihir Cabinet at an early date.                             (Cignod)   Ao BOilAR LA?&apos;.  SBtH&quot;EoY7mbor, 1918.  .         In July lest tho War Cabinet  decided that no  person should be employed in any Government Office  during the  present war who is not the child of natural-born  subjects of thiscountry or of en Allied country unless there is a definitenational reason for such employment^  4  letter was sent out from the Prime iviinister1 s Private boo rotary  on 13th August to departments, notifying them of this decision and of the .appointment of Lord Justice Bankus1 Committee, and asking theDepartments to ascertain the names of  all persons employedin them rvho were not the children of natural-born subjects ofthis country or an allied country, and to refer to theCommittee the esses of those  arsons whom they desired, fordefinite national reasons to rota in*         The Committee issued a circular  asking departments to furnish e list giving tho full names and  addresses  of allpersons coming under the exclusion and, as to any such-persons whom it was desired to retain, t,no reasons for  thatdesire.         This-&quot;*.-: s taken to me--..r that the  Commit too was&apos; to,consider in some \v*y all the c* sos and not only tho casesrecommended, for retention.         Consequently, as I understand-:, no Department  has yet dismisso . any one, all th- Deo rtments having waited forthe Committee to r sport on the whole mat tor&quot;.         This being so, 2nd the armistice having altered the situation, it v? on Id seem very difficult  now to send swayany of the alien-descended persons;  and  I have oeen s epealedto, especially by the Post office and  the Customs and  &quot;Excise,as to whether they might not suspend all  action .in the  matter.-.         I think myself that thay mi:.ht be author is oc&apos;  : t all events to suspend all action ocndinc ony  Ko jort by theCommittee to the  Prime iiilnis toi and any action ts-ien thereon,* .;&amp;r Cabinet 444, ilinuto 7.
