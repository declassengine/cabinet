(Previous Paper G.T.6&apos;203 J.To     The Secretary,           War Oabinot.      In continuation  of my  former  report  dated the  lothNovember tho crswds in tho  stroots of  tho  Metropolis  havegradually diminished, until last night tho  17th inst.  the streets were practically normal,     The  fire-works in hyde park  on Saturday evening (the 16th)  drew  eff a very largenumber of people who  seomed to enjoy the  display and  v/ereperfectly orderly and quiet.     So far I have  heard  of no damage to tho Park except one troe broken;.   In Trafalgar &apos;,Square, Piocadilly, and tlhe  Strand on  Saturday  night  therewere  large crowds but, generally speaking,  they were  quitoordorly with tho exception  of certain  Colonial  soldiers,E.A,i\ officers and a few Army Cadets  who were  drunk  and making an exhibition of themselves^     To  the  attitude of thocivil population no exception could be taken,     I do  notanticipato that thoro will  bo any  further excitement,  if conditions remain normal.,  during this  week.     Enquiries throughout London show  that  the  morale  of tkopeople is excellent and agitators  seom to be swept under bythe wavo of popular enthusiasm.    The  wave  of  loyalty  towardstho King and ;^uoen has buon  remarkable both among the  civilpopulation and among elements of the Army in London bothRegular and Oversea.   It is of course possible  that  somereaction may set in as time goes on,                     (SignodK C.ff,H.MAOEEim.6th November,  1018.,Commissioner of Police    of tho Metropolis.
