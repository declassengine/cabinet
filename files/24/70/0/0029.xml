[This Document is the Property of His  BritannicJtestVs Government./^ 11  Printed for the War Cabinet.  November 1918.*tlALL w/J^CONFIDENTIAL.HORSE RACING.    I-SHOULD like to make the following observations 011 the Memorandum circulatedby the President of the Board of Trade (G T.-6263) :-    In view of the present general  armistice and the  relaxation of  the pressure  o.lwork, it appears to me that no obstacle should be placed  upon the holding  of suchpopular amusements as would tend to ease for the general bulk of workers the periodof transition from war to peace.    I therefore agree with Sir Arthur Sfcanley&apos;s views  as  to the holding of a limitedprogramme of racing under National Hunt  Committee  and Jockey Club Rules, andalso the withdrawal of Defence of  the Realm Regulation 9.B.    1 consider it  also advisable that the question of  the withdrawal of Regulations9.B.B. and 9.1). and  10,0. should be considered so far as the Ministry of Munitions areconcerned.    The question of these latter Regulations is, however, slightly different from  thatof Regulation 9.B.   Under Regulation  9 13.  local flapping  horse  races are  totallyprohibited, whereas Regulations 9.B.B., 9.D., and 10.0.  merely give the Ministry powerto prohibit hare or rabbit  coursing, whippet races, fairs, and the  use of premises for public entertainments in cases in which it appears to the Ministry that these amuse-ments would be prejudicial to munitions  or other  work necessary for  the successful prosecution of the war.    I  suggest,  however,  that the power given  to  the Ministry to prohibit theserecreations might now safely be withdrawn, so  far as actual munitions work, as defined in the Munitions of War  Act, is concerned.   On the oilier hand, it might at the sametime be deemed desirable,  in view  of: the present coal shortage, that some such powers should be transferred to the Controller of Goal Mines, but this, of course, is a  matter for the consideration of the Controller of  Coal  Mines and the President of the Board  ofTrade.                                                 WINSTON  S. CHURCHILL.    November 18,. 1918.
