(1)  In connection with general tonnage arrangements,a certain number of  ships monthly will be sailing from thiscountry  to the Far East with accommodation for1about 6,000Coolies a  month.  If Coolies are not shipped, the space will be wasted,  as for the present a sufficient amount of export cargo isnot available.  If advantage is not taken of   the space forCoolies now, these will have to be repatriated later on whenthe export trade has been reconstituted, and they they will becarried at the expense  of cargo.               It is submitted that the War Office should make arrangements to provide Coolies  to make proper use of these ships,replacing  their labour  in France by that of German prisoners,if necessary,           (.2)  In addition there are, at the present moment, twovessels  of the passenger type, which have  to be put back intothe Pacific  for military and trade purposes,   as they haveaccommodation for 7/8,000 men, it  is requested that arrangements may be made  for this number of Coolies  to be available forembarkation  within a fortnight.               The men would be  embarked in France.               In both cases  the  detailed  arrangements to bemade by  the  War Office and the Ministry of Shipping.
