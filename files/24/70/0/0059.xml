w. cffets-lteluiaent is the  Property of His Britannic M-ajesty&apos;s fowomeat]CONFIDENTIAL.    G.T.-6356.1    12    -2.BALTIC PROVINCES.     THE small nationalities which lie  along the shores of the Baltic southward fromthe Gulf of Finland present problems  of peculiar difficulty.  They seem  too weak to stand unsupported  between the German and the Russian Empires.  Yet in race theyare utterly different from both their great neighbours as well as  from each other ; inreligion they are either Protestant  (Esthonia) or Roman Catholic (Livland), but in no case Orthodox ; in culture they are far superior to the Russians, but very hostile to theGermans.  They have successfully retained their individuality through generations ofbureaucratic oppression, and as soon as Russia collapsed, each one of them put in a claim to be treated as an independent self-sufficing nation.     It should be added that neither the Baltic barons of Teutonic extraction, nor theRussian officials, nor the German military party, who have dominated them since theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk, even showed  the slightest  sympathy with their  aspirations;and the behaviour of the latter is almost incredible in its  brutal stupidity.   Announc-ing themselves as  liberators, they divided  up the whole region by  frontiers, whichdeliberately violated national sentiment; they  imposed commercial treaties with themost  cynical  indifference  to  the interests  of anyone   but  themselves; and  theycompelled the use  of  German in schools where no German child was in  the habit of attending.    There seems to be  only four possible methods of dealing with this situation, either at the Peace Conference or otherwise :      1. We  may  sanction   the  Brest-Litovsk  arrangement, a  solution  not worthdiscussing.    2. We  may refuse to  recognise any mortification of the old pre-war relationsbetween  these  small nations and Russia.  This  also, I think, should  be  rejectedsimpliciter.    3. We  may attempt to give them local autonomy,  either  (a) under German or(b) under Russian suzerainty.   - 4. We may give them complete independence.    The third of these solutions autonomy under the aegis of a Great Power is atfirst sight attractive. And if I were sure that either  Germany or Russia were going tobe genuinely democratic  in spirit as well as in form, I might recommend it forconsideration. But so far as history can tell us anything on the subject it tell us, with no uncertain voice, that the Russian bureaucracy by its inherent laws of development will  in  time squeeze autonomy to death, while the history of Central Europe, whether under the  Hohenzollerhs or the  Haps burgs, shows an enduring intolerance of smallnational units within the German or Austro-Hungarian Empire.    I incline therefore, on the whole, to the creation of three small national States,Esthonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania, whose frontiers  shall follow, as nearly  as may be,ethnological  lines.*   Their  respective  populations  would  be  Esthonia,  about1^ millions ; Latvia, about t\ millions ; and Lithuania, about 5 millions.    It would be most  desirable  that these small communities should federate among themselves, and if possible join some larger Baltic aggregation including Finland andsome  or all of the Scandinavian  Powers.  Let us  do all  we can to encourage thisconsummation, but  let  us avoid  exacting undue pressure.   Our experience of forcedmarriages in these regions  is not reassuring ;  and if it has proved impossible to keepNorway and Sweden united, and  if Denmark and  Iceland  seem drifting apart, theprospect of inducing  their neighbours to join who  differ  profoundly  in race andlanguage  and do not  always  agree in religion, seems somewhat remote.   We should however do what we can, though the idea that any confederation which did not includeRussia could  ever  dispute  German supremacy  in the  Baltic, seems to  me  quitefantastic.
