      [This Document is the Property -of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]      3 confidential.31*MEMORANDUM FOR  THE  WAR CABINET.(   Restrictions on the  operations of-              (a.) Enemy Firms,              (b) Allied or Neutral Firms,as regards investment  of capital, ownership of property, or export of goodswithin or from the Empire.I                            Self-Governing Dominions.    Generally speaking, the rule  in the  self-governing  Dominions  is to give equaltrading rights to all persons and firms, whether British or foreign, though, of course,since the outbreak of war  extensive measures have  been  taken in the Dominions, as elsewhere, to  deal with enemy interests, such  as  the  winding up of businesses or theappointment of custodians of enemy property.    As  regards measures of a  more  permanent  character, the following may be mentioned : I. Tariffs,    New  Zealand  has  taken power to  impose  a  special   ad  valorem   surtax of Act No. 39 of50 per cent, on enemy goods.                                                      1915, s. 28.II. Coasting Trade.    In Canada, power exists to close the coasting  trade  to ships of any nationality,but the ships  of several foreign nations, including Italy, Belgium, and  the Netherlands, -are still admitted to the trade.  In New Zealand, power is reserved,  by law to restrict the coasting trade to cases where  reciprocity exists.    In Australia, where shipping after the war will be regulated by the NavigationAct of 1913 (passed before the war, but not yet brought into force), there is full powerto regulate the coasting  trade.  Generally speaking,  the  regulations  will apply to all ships, whether British or foreign, but it  is laid down that no  vessel shall  engage inthe coasting trade which is receiving any subsidy from a foreign Government.HI. Acquisition of Land.    In  New Zealand the law provides that every alien friend resident in New Zealand Act No. 5 of 1908,may acquire, hold, or dispose of every description of property in  the same manner as s. 12.if he were a natural born subject of His Majesty.    Similarly,  the  Canadian law  provides  that real and personal property may be &amp;  jgQg Ci 77iacquired, held,  and disposed of  by an alien in the same manner in all respects as by a natural  born  British subject.  i It should be mentioned, however, that in Canada the free  grants  of land  in thePrairie  Provinces are limited to British subjects or to those declaring their intentionto become British subjects.  Again, in certain of the States of Australia,  restrictionsare imposed upon the tenure of  Crown land  by aliens, which do not apply  to naturalborn or naturalised British subjects.IV. Banks and Businesses.    Legislation is in force  in Canada under which :     (a.) A majority of the directors of joint stock banks shall  be natural born or 3.4 Qe0. v, c. 9,naturalised British  subjects.                                                       s. 20.     .) A majority of the directors  of railways, the construction of which has been &amp; g, 1906 c 38assisted by the  Canadian Government, shall  be British subjects.                       s.11&apos;2.    &apos; &quot;  &apos;      [991]
V. Petroleum.    In view of the importance  attached  to  the conservation of petroleum  product)within the  British Empire, special action has been taken in Canada and Kew Zealanjto maintain  British control.  In  Canada, the  Dominion Crown  Lands  Regulationcontain  a provision  against  direct or indirect foreign control, and  also contemplaiexpropriation  in  emergency or war.  New Zealand  law provides for expropriate &quot;\ \similar circumstances.8-9 Geo. V, c. 14. Orders in Council of 9.3.15 and 9.10.17. War RegulationsI 21.12.16 andI Shipping Regula- tions 11.6.17. Act 34 of 1917.YI.-Mines.     Special action has been taken since 1 be war with reference to the mining industijin Australia.  Membership of the Commonwealth  Metal  Exchange (created since fwar), where practically all sales  and purchases of metals or  minerals  for  exportconsumption beyond the  Commonwealth  have to be registered is confined  to naturalborn British subjects domiciled in Australia.     In  Newfoundland  a Non-Ferrous Metals Act has been passed on the  lines of recetlImperial legislation requiring persons dealing in certain ores and metals to be licenseby 1 he Government.  This legislation is temporary in  operation.   Its intention is tprevent the grant of licences to persons of enemy nationality.VII. Merchant Shipping.    Legislation  similar to the British  Ships (Transfer Restriction) Acts of 1915 an1910  of the United Kingdom,  under which power is  taken  to control  trans ftmortgages, or transfers of mortgages of British ships (except  those  registered  in self-governing  Dominions) to foreign controlled  companies  for the period of the \and three years afterwards is in force in some  of the Dominions.    In Canada action has been taken under the War Measures  Act by means of Ordeiin Council, and the measures taken are (like the British legislation) to have effectto three years after the war.    In New Zealand action has been taken by war and shipping regulations ; no lim)of time is mentioned.    In -Newfoundland  legislation  has been  passed  similar  to  that of the Unit!Kingdom, and extending over a similar period.     0Colonies and Protectorates.    The. Colonies  and Protectorates  as  a  rule  follow  the  practice  of  the UnitlKingdom for the time being so far as concerns the treatment of foreigners and foreiacapital.  Thus restrictions on aliens holding land have everywhere been repealed salin one African Protectorate the Gambia where the former English law on the subje!still survives, and aliens require a special Act of the legislature to enable them to hiland.   Certain restrictions are  maintained for  defence purposes in the fortresses!Gibraltar and Malta, and, for  strategic  reasons,  aliens are forbidden to hold landFanning and Washington  Islands  in the  Pacific  Ocean.   During the war temporalegislation  has been enacted to make the Governors consent necessary to the acquiltion of oil rights in Trinidad, or of any interest in land in  the East Africa Protectora]Both  measures were  intended  to deal  with  suspected  attempts  by  neutralscover enemy  acquisitions.  Both come to  an  end after the war.  But  one colon!British  Guiana, has passed  a permanent law preventing  alien  corporations frosholding land in the colony without  the Governors licence.    Apart from these  insignificant  exceptions, aliens are as free to own land in tljcolonies  and protectorates as they are in England.  Such permanent  restrictionsforeigners as at present exist apply only to the exploitation of a few specified miner!on Crown lands, or lands in  the occupation of native tribes.   Far  the most importafof these minerals is petroleum.  As  oil fuel is a vital need of the Navy the Colon]Office, at the  request of the Admiralty, decided some years before the war to confto British subjects and corporations under British control  the right of winning oillands which were the property of the State or  of native tribes,  and laws or regulatiolenforcing these restrictions exist in all Colonies or Protectorates in which petroleum!supposed to occur.   This is, of course, a matter  in which  national  defence imiS) talprecedence  of  economic considerations, and  it  is not  unlikely that Lord  HarcourjCommittee will recommend some further precautions as regards oil.
    The same policy has been followed as far as possible in regard to bauxite depositson Crown lands and lands occupied by native tribes, in view of the national importanceof securing control of an adequate supply of aluminium.  So far as is known at present only two Colonies are concerned British  Guiana  and  the Gold  Coast.  A company with American capital under British control is exploiting bauxite deposits on Crownland in British Guiana, and an Ordinance has been passed to reserve to the colonial government  the right   to  work  the  recently discovered  bauxite  deposits on theGold Coast.     During the current year the  attention of Colonial Governors has been called tothe importance  of keeping, as far as  possible, iii British hands  the  exploitation ofcertain minerals on  State-owned  lands.   These   minerals  are  bauxite, quicksilver,wolfram,  palladium,  chrome  ore,  manganese,   copper,  graphite,  platinum,   lead,vanadium, and  monazite.  But  no legislation restricting  foreign  operations   is atpresent contemplated.   The  Colonies have, however, been  invited to consider whether&quot;The Imperial Xon-Ferrous Metal Industry Act, 191.8,&quot; should  be adopted, but  someof those consulted do not propose to do this.     It is important, to notice that this policy does not apply to privately-owned  land.Thereis nothing to prevent a foreigner owningor working oil or any other reserved mineralon his own freehold  in any Colony or Protectorate  except in so far as the Non-FerrousMetal Industry A ct may be applied.  Asa matter of fact an American-owned corporation in Trinidad wins oil on  its own land.   It is  believed that foreigners have  recentlyacquired bauxite deposits on private lands  in British Guiana, but the  Colonial  Officeinterferes so little with  the  rights of foreign freeholders in the Colonies that it is not definitely known whether the lands in question are still in foreign hands.     It  should also be noticed that the  policy of  confining the  exploitation  of state-owned minerals to British subjects does  not preclude the investment of foreign capital.So long as the control of a corporation is in British hands the Colonial Office does not,in the  absence of special circumstances, exclude an admixture of  foreign capital.  Infact the capital of the  largest  oil company in  Trinidad  was  partly subscribed byforeigners.   Shares  in  Trinidad  oil  companies  are  freely bought  by  individualforeigners.  It was  recently decided to use the  powers  of  the Board  of  Trade toprevent foreigners acquiring more shares in Gold Coast oil companies, but there werereasons to believe that  certain foreign  interests  designed to secure control of  these companies.    Apart  from  such special  circumstances, the Colonial  Office  does not prevent the investment of foreign capital.     Possibly the legislation passed in some Colonies and Protectorates dealing with the registration of business  names  might  be held  to involve a discrimination againstforeigners.  It provides that foreign businesses shall not use names of a descriptivecharacter which do  not  disclose the  fact  that their control is not British.  But such legislation follows Imperial precedents.     To sum up, the restrictions on foreigners in the Colonies and Protectorates apply only to a few minerals   on State-owned  lands, and even in that  case do not excludeforeign co-operation.     The  recent temporary legislation in the Malay States  about rubber lands  is not strictly in point, but should be mentioned to prevent misunderstanding.  A temporarywar measure  has been passed  to prevent transfers  and  acquisition of new rubberlands.   This was done,  as it was not thought equitable that Americans and Japanese,who were not liable to  the excess profits tax, should seize the  opportunity to acquirelands  needed for  the  development  of  British  companies which were  temporarilyprevented by the tax and by the restrictions  on  capital issues from extending their operations as in peace time.     As regards export  duties, a differential export duty is imposed on tin ore in theStraits and Nigeria to ensure the ore  being smelted  on British territory.  This dutywas originally imposed to defeat an American attempt to capture the smelting  industry.It has  also been decided to adopt a similar  policy in regard  to  West African palmkernels for five years after the war, in order to  transfer the crushing industry fromGermany to this country.  In each case  the differential duties apply to British subjects.and foreigners alike.                                                                      W. .H L.  T     Colonial Office,        14th Novemher, 1918.
