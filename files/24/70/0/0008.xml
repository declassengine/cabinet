/ 7is Document  is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.WAR   CABINET.JUVENILE EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES,(Memorandum circulated by  the  Ministry  of  Reconstruction);     At the present time,,  owing; to the existence of duallegislation, both the Board of Education and the Ministry ofLabour are concerned with questions affecting, juvenileemployment.   The Labour Exchanges Act 1909 enables the hinistiof Labour to set up Juvenile Advisory Committees in connectionwith all Employment Exchanges and the Choice of Employment Actenables Local Education Authorities to set up Choice ofETtiployment Committees in their areas.   Committees of one typeor the other have beer, set up in nearly 200 areas, butdifficulties have always arisen in connection with the choice of Employment Committees, owing to the desire of Local EducationAuthorities to exorcise a greater degree of control over the juvenile Employment Exchange than was acceptable to the Ministryof Labour,   It is understood that in some six or eight areasthese difficulties are /still preventing the establishment of any committee to deal with juveniles, and it is urgently necessarythat some solution should be found to cops with the aeriousproblems of juvenile employment curing resettlement.  It is also desirable to secure that all existing choice of employment committees work in close co-operation and sympathy with theMinistry of Labour curing resettlement.nat the Ministry of Labour and the Board     It is understood th?of Education arc taking steps to secure the necessary co-uperationin the last mentioned class of case;  but it is not clear that everything possible has yet been done to make immediate provision in those areas where, for any reason, no Committee of any mine has yet been set up.   It is suggested that the best course would beto set up a provisional committee on a temporary basis in all such areas, half of the members to be nominated by the Local AdvisoryCommittee (which are concerned with general demobilisationquestions) and half to be nominated by&apos; the Local EducationAuthority.   The provisional committees themselves would beappointed by the Minister of Labour.     It would also be very desirable to secure as soon as possiblethat the differences of view between the Ministry of Labourand the Board of Education should be composed, and that as apermanent measure of Reconstruction, some more satisfactory jointpolicy should be agreed upon for the future conduct of JuvenileEmployment Committees.   It is understood that the President ofthe Board of Education and the Minister of Labour have for someyears been carrying; on negotiations with a view to reaching somepermanent Settlement, but that no agreement, has yet been reached.16th November, 1918,
