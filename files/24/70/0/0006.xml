 M^HOHAHDUH FROM Til?. CHAIRMAN OF THF -;FAR OABINgT        COMMITS ON ACCOMMODATION.    Referred^ Mfaks              November 191R.  Committee 01     POLICY TO P&quot;, ADOPTED 1REGARD TO TEJ RWISITIOHIIKt OF PR^MIS^S&quot; TO ME% 0UTSTAND1HG MFlTJTURT;; Df^iANDg FOR ADD!?IONAL&apos; ACCOIMODATION AND INSTRUCTIONS A;J TO i^QUISIfTONIflG FOR PURPOSES&quot; OTH^N THAN T^ClfNlCAlLy FOR THF ^ ffTOTCEi     In view of the fact that the public have, during thepast four years of the War, submitted with considerablepatience to the curtailment of their liberties in respectof the requisitioning that has taken place under theDefence of the Realm.Acts, and as any further requisitioninwill undoubtedly meet with determined opposition, of whichI already have evidence, I am of the opinion  that the time has arrived when the. ruling of the. War Cabinet should beobtained to the effect that in connection with all futuredemands for accommodation no requisitioning of houses in private occupati -n,  in order to suit the convenience ofGovernment Officials, should be permitted under any circumstances whatever and thai the requisitioning rfother occupied premises  should only be authorised in exceptional circumstances which render such a courseunavoidable.     2.   I would also.suggest that my Committee should beauthorised to inform all, Government-Departments requiringfurther accommodation that they must in the national    ,  ;interest accept such premises as may be available orcontinue in occupation of the premises which  thev now
occupy, whatever inconvenience this may involve.     1*   The difficulties which are &quot;being encountered Iin regard to the provision of accommodation in connectiowith the important schemes dealing with demobilisationunder the supervision &quot;of the Minister of Labour and theissue of pensions under the Minister of Pensions,  cannot,however, be solved in this manner, and the position is becoming most acute owing to the absence of compulsory powers for these purposes.   The ^111 which has now been presented by the minister of Labour will, if passed,meet the situation in regard to demobilisation, as alsowill clause 18 of the War Pensions  (AdministrativeProvision) Bill in regard to the i^sue of pensions, but unless the latter is passed at once there must be serious delay in meeting the request received from theMinister of Pensions for immediate accommodation forBOO persons in three different localities.   It isimpossible to provide this accommodation where and when required without compulsory powers.     4.   in these circumstances, and in view of the reluctance of the War Office to take the responsibilityof requisitioning outside their technical powers asadvised by the Law Officers, I must ask the War cabinet for an immediate decision as to how far they arePrepared, pending the above measures becoming law, togive instructions that, where necessary, requisitioningshall be proceededvwlth, even at the risk of litigationon the ground of illegality.
