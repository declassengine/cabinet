(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM. G.T. 6383

The Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary State for the Colonies.

(Received, Colonial Office, 10.25 a.m. 23rd November, 1918.).

------

Private and Personal. In view of suggestion of the Times that Smartt should be invited to the Peace Conference and the preliminary discussions (a suggestion also made by "Cape Times" the Editor of which is the Times correspondent in this country) I think it right to send you a brief account of the negotiations which have taken place on the subject between General Botha and Smartt. I wrote to you fully on the 16th of November but my letter will not leave Capetown before the end of the week.

General Botha asked Smartt to accompany him to England at public expense for purpose of consultation.  Smartt after consideration informed General Botha that he would only go if asked by His Majesty&apos;s Government. He stated that in Dominions where there is a coalition Government His Majesty&apos;s Government had invited representatives of both parties in the coalition; and that while there has been no formal coalition here, there is a de facto coalition, because the Unionists have enabled General Botha to remain power during the war without an independent majority of his own. General Botha pointed out that it was not in his power to invite anyone to the conference, that rested entirely with His Majesty&apos;s Government who could hardly be expected to invite the Leader of one party not represented in Government without inviting the leaders of the nationalist and labour parties the former of whom could be relied upon to cause trouble.

I informed General Botha officially that i could clearly not approach His Majesty&apos;s Government except on the direct


direct request of my Prime Minister. No such request is of course likely to be made to me. I also told him privately that I agreed with attitude which he had taken in the matter.

In spite of pressure from Duncan and other Unionists who consider Smartt&apos;s point of view unreasonable, Smartt has definitely refused to alter his decision.

It seems to me quite clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not justifiably invite Smartt. The political position here has no doubt been peculiar and indeed unique and the Unionists have loyally - and often to their political disadvantage - supported General Botha during war, but in no sense an actual coalition. The Unionists have no sort of responsibility for the Government of the country and it would I feel sure only lead to trouble if His Majesty&apos;s Government departed from principle of dealing only with the responsible Ministers of a Dominion. On the other hand General Botha might fairly be held to be under an obligation to ask Smartt to go with him and to give him his advice. This General Botha has fully recognised and he is not unnaturally annoyed at the manner in which his offer has been received. I have no doubt that most of Smartt&apos;s own supportes would feel that he had an admirable opportunity of furthering the interests of his party and of those whom they represent.  

Postscrip. Have just heard from General Botha that Smartt has now asked whether he would be prepared to propose that Smartt should be admitted to Conference in advisory capacity if he went to England with Prime Minister. General Botha has declined to do this on two grounds. Firstly because if persons other than Ministers were admitted it would be impossible to object to admission of Nationalist deputation which is understood to be going to England to claim Independence. Secondly because initiative to issue invitations rests in His Majesty&apos;s Government and as they have not invited leaders of opposition in Canada, Australia, General Botha is not prepared to embarrass them by asking that they should invite Smartt.
