&apos;Thjs Documens ProperSECR S T,Copy Noo;aB/^/58619lo   The attention of the War- Cabinet is drawn to thesituation which has arisen at Murmansk owing to dlffi-culties over food and currency for the civilian population and to the steps which have been taken by the far Officeto meet this situationo2 *   Diving to the breakdown of the cable service to murmansk communication has been uncertain and several important telegrams from General Maynard have apparentlynot yet been receivedo   The gravity of the situationis brought out by General Maynard&apos;s M*l368/SoT. of 4thNovember, and Mc-1449/G of 13th November., (attached atA &amp; B) in Mr Lindley&apos;s No0 379 dated 4th November, tothe Foreign Office,  (attached at C) in which GeneralMaynard fs views are expressedo     The British troops are echelonned down the MurmanRailway as far as Soroka, a distance of 400 miles fromMurmansk.  Their supply is entirely dependent on therailway, which is at any time so inefficient as barulyto supply the needs of the troops and civil populationsIn addition^ the line is extremely vulnerable tosabotage by malcontents and enemy agentso  The numberof troops at General Maynard&apos;s disposal are quiteinsufficient, to ensure the safe working of the line ifthe population, and especially the railway workers,, arehostile e3o   Representations have accordingly been made tothe Foreign Office,, pressing for the immediate increaseof the ration issued by the addition of meat, lard etc.In the rations sent out in June and July; which were to last them till the end of October^ a certain proportionof these commodities was included;, but the later ship-ments to Murmansk have been based on a scalo told downby the command at Archangel in conjunction with civilianauthorities., which scale did not include meat or fatseIn the case of Archangel, however, a certain quantity of pork., which was additional to the foodstuffs demanded onthe scale? was shipped from the United States of Americajand no further anxiety is felt on that score in that theatre, but at Murmansk the situation can only bealleviated by immediate provision from this country ofthe necessary additional supplies, and I request thatthe Shipping Controller may be instructed to provide thene c e s s a ry t onna ge o4c   The matter of currency has been taken up with theTreasury, who arc being pressed to supply the necessaryTreasury notes, and with the Admiralty for the provision .of a destroyer or other fast nhipoWar Office j15 e lX7l8 o(3d,)  P.  dc  Be  Radcliffe,                   DaMeCc   for C.I.G.S.

Young at Murmansk,   GeneralMaynard vrould be glad if you would again represent to authorities at home seriousness of situation caused by our being unable to carry out Article VII of Murmansk agree-ment,   Safety of his force depends mainly on railway.He cannot guarantee regular working or even security of line unless be can issue meat ration to workmenc   On theother hand no meat is included in supplies consigned for civil population and cannot draw any further on hisreserve.   Mr. Lam..... shares General H&quot;,ynard&apos;s view thatmeat is .i vital necessity,  (group unde cypher able) an-i inArchangel and he asks v,rhat arrangements if any exist therefor issuing meat to workmen in (^essential) services0It should be borne in mind that Murmansk area unlike&apos;Archangel Government is (?without) food resources of itsown and population are unable to augment ration except with fish and very scanty supplies of Reindeer *   Moreoversupplies for Murmansk are being calculated at home onsupposition of civil population of 60,000 which is almost certainly 20,000 or 30,000 below.J actual number,T,31393
