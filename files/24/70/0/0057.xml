cument is the  Property -of His  Britannic Majesty^ GsveammeflLl      1  Q QCONFIDENTIAL.G.T.-6354.        &apos;                                            12                                    POLAND     THE Associated Powers  are deeply pledged to a restoration of an independentPolish State with access  to the sea.*  But  the  determination  of  the  frontiers withinwhich this State should  lie oilers  problems  of peculiar  difficulty, due  partly tohistorical, partly to ethnical, partly to political, and partly to international reasons.     The simplest and most obvious plan would be to constitute a Polish State out ofthe districts where there was a Polish majority, wherever those districts might happen to be situated; but this  plan  excludes  certain territories which the large number of poles for historic and social reasons would desire to  include ;  and it includes certainterritories which it will be extremely difficult to wrest from Germany.     Except on  the  side of Hungary, where the Carpathians  give  a well markedphysical boundary, Poland  has, at no period of its history, possessed natural frontier.During the last 600 years it has, at various periods embraced vast areas, in which thePoles form but a small, and numerically, insignificant minority.     This would matter little  if the former  connections with Poland had left nothingbehind it but  historic memories.  But this is not  the case.  In Eastern Galicia, forexample, and in parts of Lithuania, the wealthiest and the most  cultivated classes areof Polish origin, and though, so far as I  can judge, this fact ought not to modify our policy at the Peace  Conference,  we must not conceal from ourselves  that, to divideGalicia and leave the Ruthenians, who are in the majority in the Eastern half,  to bejoined to  their  Little Russian kinsmen, would create a  very  painful feeling amongmany Polish patriots.     The difficulty, however,  of  excluding from the new Poland  non-Polish areas is small  compared to the  problem of including in it  the  areas  which are  genuinelyPolish.  If this  last  operation  were completely  effected, East Prussia  would be divided by a  tongue of Polish  land from Prussian  Pomerania.  Germany would be deprived of the Silesian coalfields a district of the utmost value to  Germany, thoughethnographieally Polish from time immemorial and the Eastern frontier of  germany would be drawn 50 miles west of its present  position, and  not more than, I suppose,70 miles from  Berlin.   Evidently,  nothing but  a  crushing  defeat  can  tear  these-territories, originally acquired by Frederick the Great, from Germany&apos;s grasp.     About Austria I  say nothing,  seeing that, as compared with the other surgicaloperations which are to be  performed on that composite State, the excision of Galiciais unimportant.     Access  to  the  sea, which has been promised to the New Poland by  the Allies,presents considerable difficulties.   There is but one good port on the Baltic through.which that  access can be secured, namely Danzig.   But Danzig  town is  not Polish,though its surroundings are.   It  has from time  to time been under the  suzerainty ofthe Polish State; but essentially it  is one of  the  free cities of the  Hanseatic Leaguewhich, loosely  associated with  the  Holy Roman  Empire, played   a great part inmediasval commerce.  Are  we, then,  to  give Poland access to the sea through a  citywhich is predominantly  German, and which,  as I have already explained, cannot betransferred to Poland without cutting off the German districts  of East  Prussia  fromdirect access to the rest of Germany ?  I am myself inclined to answer this  question inthe negative.  But if that view be accepted, I can see no other method  of redeemingour promise to Poland than that of conferring upon her certain rights of free transit onthe Vistula, and perhaps in addition making Danzig a free port.     I append sketch map  showing what the limits of a  strictly ethnic  Poland wouldbe, and what relations its frontiers would  bear  to the frontiers of existing States.  Iam of opinion that at the Peace Conference we should try for these boundaries exceptthat,  in addition to the city of Danzig, a strip  of  territory  should be reserved td-Germany, giving a land connection between East and West Prussia.

ANNEX.                                 Joint Allied Aims. M. Briand and  Mr. Asquith (French and  British  Premiers)-Joint Telegram to  M.  Stuermer     (Russian Premier), November 16, 11)16.          &quot;. .  . . We are profoundly gratified to see that Russia, who at the very outset      of the war gave to the peoples dwelling in all Polish lands assurances in conformity      with their  immemorial hopes,  now thwarts  the  manoeuvres of our enemies, and      exposes in the full light of day the illusory character of their promises, by solemnly      renewing the  unshakable decision proclaimed more than two  years  ago, in the      name of His Majesty the Emperor, to bring about their autonomy.  We rejoice      sincerely at the generous initiative taken by the Government of His Majesty the      Emperor of Russia in aid of a people to whom we are attached by sympathies of      long standing, and whose restored union will constitute a fundamental element of      the future equilibrium of Europe.          &quot; We are happy entirely to  concur in the views of which the Imperial Govern-      ment means to assure the realisation for the benefit of the noble  Polish people.&quot;                                                         &quot; Times&quot; November 18, 1916, 8 b. Allied Governments : Note to M. Milyukov-March 1917.          &quot; The Allies see in Russia&apos;s decision  the triumph of the principles of liberty,      which are those of modern States, and are the strength of the nations of the Allies      in the struggle which they are carrying on against the Germanic coalition.          &quot; In addressing to the Provisional Government their hearty congratulations, the     Allies  desire to declare before public  opinion and before the whole Polish people,      that they feel themselves at one with Russia in the idea of calling Poland once more     into being as  an integral  whole, and they  also desire to give proof  by their     co-operation of the constant interest which they have  never ceased to show in the     reconstitution of a  nation which  has  been called to play an important part in     future Europe.&quot;                                 &quot;Daily Review Foreign Press&quot; (A.P S.), March 18, 1917, p. 243. Prime Ministers of Great Britain, Prance, and Italy-Declaration, Versailles, June 3,1918.          &quot; 1.  The constitution of  a united and independent Polish State with free access     to the sea constitutes one of  the conditions of a solid and just peace, and of the     rule  of right in Europe.          &quot; 2. The Allied Governments have noted with pleasure the declaration made     by the  Secretary of State of the United States Government and desire to associate     themselves in an expression of earnest sympathy for the nationalistic aspirations     towards freedom of the Czecho-Slovak  and Jugo-Slav peoples.&quot;                                                             &quot;Times,&quot; June 6, 1918, 7 c.                              British Imperial Aims.Mr. Bonar Law (Chancellor of Exchequer)-Answer to Question, House of Commons, April 26,1917.         &quot;.  . .  .  As the House is aware, one of the first acts of the Provisional Russian     Government was to issue a proclamation to the Poles, recognising  their  right to     decide their own destiny, and stating  that the creation of  an Independent Polish     State would be a sure guarantee of durable peace in Europe.  I am confident     that  I rightly interpret  the  feeling of  this House when I  say that we welcome     that declaration and look forward to the time  when, thanks to  the liberal and     statesmanlike action of the Provisional Russian  Government,  Poland will  again     appear  in  international  life  and  take  her share  with other nations in working     together for the common good  of  civilisation.   Our  efforts in  the war will  be &apos;     directed towards helping Poland  to realise her unity on the lines  described in  the     Russian Proclamation, that is to say, under conditions which will make her strong     and  independent. We hope that after the war  Great Britain will remain united     to Poland in bonds of close friendship.....&quot;                                            &quot; Parliamentary Proceedings?

 Lord Robert Cecil (Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Blockade)-    Speech, House of Commons, May 16, 1917.          &quot; .  . . . What about Poland ?  I think we are all  agreed that it is desirable     tp set up an independent Poland.....&quot;                                                Parliamentary Proceedings&quot; Vol. 93, col. 1671. Mr. Lloyd  George (Prime Minister)-Speech to Delegates of Trades  Unions, Central Hall, Westminster,                                 January 5, 1918.          &quot; .  . .  . We believe .... that  an  independent  Poland, comprising  all     those  genuine   Polish elements  who desire to form  part of it, is an  urgent     necessity for the stability of Western Europe.....&quot;                                                     &quot; Times&quot; January 7, 1918, pp. 7 and 8.                           United States Government Aims. President Wilson-Address to U.S. Semite, January 22, 1917.         &quot; .... I take it  for granted, for instance, if I  may  venture upon a single     example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that  there should be  a united,     independent, and autonomous Poland, and  that henceforth inviolable security of     life, of worship, of industrial and  social development  should be guaranteed to all     peoples who have  lived  hitherto  under the poAver of Governments devoted to a     faith and purpose hostile  to their own.  .  . .&quot;                                                            &quot;Why we are at War&quot; p. 11. President Wilson Message to Congress, Washington, January 8,  1918.     Peace program.         &quot; XIII.  An independent Polish State should be erected which should include     the territories inhabited by indisputably  Polish   populations, which should  be     assured a free and secure access  to  the  sea, and  whose political and  economic     independence and  territorial integrity  should be guaranteed by international     covenant.&quot;                                                      &quot;In  our First Year of War&quot; p. 159.                              French Government Aims. M.  Clemeneeau (President of the Council, Minister for War) Letter to Count Zamoyski, September 3,.    1918.         &quot;. . .  .  Rest assured  that  on the day  of  our  victory,   France .... in.     harmony with her allies, will spare no effort to resurrect a free Poland  according.     to her national aspirations and set in her historical  boundaries.&quot;                                                          &quot; Le Temps,&quot; September 8, 1918.                              Italian Government Aims. Baron Sonnino (Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs)-Speech, Chamber, June 20,1917.         &quot; Among the most  essential  conditions  of peace we place the restoration of     those three unfortunate countries whose territory has been occupied and devastated ;.     Belgium  whose long martyrdom has aroused the sympathy of the whole civilised     world ; Serbia and Montenegro overwhelmed by superior forces, but not subdued.     We join with the Allies in insisting also on the unification  and independence of     Poland as the outcome of this world-war, inspired by the liberation of  oppressed    nationalities.&quot;                                                      &quot; Corriere delta Sera&quot; June 21, 1917.Signor Orlando (Italian Prime Minister)-Speech, Chamber, December 12,1917.         &quot; . . .  .  The Allied  Powers,  inspired  by   the  principle of  respect  of&quot;    nationalities, are in agreement in considering that the creation of an independent    and indivisible  Poland in  conditions  which will  ensure  its free political and    economic development, constitutes one of the elements of a just and durable peace,,    and of the regime of right in Europe.&quot;                                                         &quot; Times,&quot; December 14, 1917, 7 c.
EXTRACT FROM &quot;THE TIMES&quot; OF  OCTOBER  17, 1918.                Polish National Army. Recognition by Great Britain.     The British Government has recognised the Polish National Army as autonomous, allied, and co-belligerent.  In announcing this fact to Count Sobanski, delegate of the Polish National Committee in  Great Britain, Mr. Balfour adds :      &quot; I take this opportunity of informing you that His  Majesty&apos;s Government have not failed to follow with interest and appreciation  the unremitting efforts which  the Polish National Committee has made since its recognition by the Allied Governments in fortifying its compatriots throughout  the world in  their resistance to  the  Central Powers and to all compromise with  them in the solution, of the Polish question.  The confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the loyalty of the committee to the Allied cause remains unshaken.     &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly announced their desire  to  see  the creation of  a united  and independent Polish State, and they were glad to join in the declaration by the Great Powers of  Versailles on the 3rd June,  1918, that the creation of such a State with free access to the sea constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace.     &quot;I need hardly assure you that the sympathies of this country have been  and are with the  people of  Poland, of whatever politics, class, or creed, in all the sufferings to which they have been subjected  during the war.   It  admires their firm refusal to allow Germany and Austria-Hungary to  dictate the future status and boundaries of their country ;  and  it looks forward to  a time when  the present provisional arrange-ments will come to an end and a Poland free and united will shape its own constitution according to the wishes  of its people. That this happy moment  may be near at handis the most earnest wish of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.&quot; Renter.o
