&apos;a 118          I beg to submit the following Report  on the  work  ofthe Food Production Department for the  week ended 19th November.-              The Weather and Condition of Crops.          Pine, dry, frosty weather has been experiencedthroughout the country during the past  week and has  greatly facilitated the carrying on of farm wor-k of all kinds.   Thefrost does not appear to have been sufficiently severe to damagepotatoes and other crops, except to a small degree in  Yorkshire,Lancashire and Cheshire, but has materially improved the landfor autumn cultivation and sowing.          The lifting of the potato crop is still in progress,except in a few districts where this crop has already  beenharvested.   Disease is reported from some of the low  lyingdistricts, though, generally the crop is heavy and comparativelyfree from disease.                    LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.              Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.          The Department have decided not to issue a general order for the ploughing up of seeds, but in certain counties,where Executive Committees have made application to the Board,an order applying only to the county for which it is made hasbeen issued requiring the breaking up of various  grass mixturessown before 1918.   Orders of this nature have already beenissued to Cambridgeshire, Lindsey, Somerset and East Sussex,  and
applications from other  counties ere at  present  being  dealt  wit          The following  example of  the work  of AgriculturalExecutive Committees reported during the week is  of  interest:-Staffordshire - Highgate Common, the cultivation  of  which  by tljCommittee has been previously mentioned  in these  Reports,  isabout to be handed back  to the owner, who has undertaken to  pathe Committee for the cost of cultivation carried out  by themand to let the land for  a period of five years to tenants  on heestate *   fJL^ypJii &quot; A farmer  at Thorverton and a  farmer at  Luppittin Devon have each been fined  10 for failing to  comply  with acultivation order served upon them  by the Executive  Committee.Land Drainage - The Kesteven Executive Committee  have, duringthe season just concluded, induced  various drainage  authoritieiin the county tc cleanse arterial channels,  by the employmentof prisoners of war, and have carried out certain similar  workthemselveso   About 34 miles of rivers, dykes and^ main drainshave thus been cleansed, and the improvement of 2,800  acres  ofland has resulted at a total expenditure of   1,170 (an averageof little over 8/- per acre).Determination of Tenancies - During the &apos;week 4 Orders  have beejmade by the Board determining tenancies on account of  bad  fan;In respect of 180 acreso                     HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Provision cf Land for Allotments - Reports received  from l,193lDistricts show that 293,900 plots containing 21,294  acres  havebeen provided, under the Cultivation of Lands (Allotments)  Ordftj1916,  and&quot;previous Ordersr          During the week, in addition to the. area mentionedabove,  11 Local Authorities have agreed to acquire 496 acres(7,4f36 allotments) including 461 acres at Leicester.          At Kingsbridge (Devon) approximately 60$ of  the housjholders are cultivating an allotment.   About the  same percenjare cultivating kitchen gardens,
Fruit Section - Demonstrations in fruit cultivation have beenheld in Holland (Linos.) during the week, the meetings beingattended almost entirely by commercial growers.Marketing - Herefordshire.   A special meeting was called by the horticultural Sub-Committee on the 13th November, and proposals were put forward for the expansion of the marketing scheme forthe coming season.   It was decided to form a County Society witha nominal capital and to appoint an agent to carry out the workon organised lines.Somerset - A conference is to be held in the West of England towhich all County Societies in that district will be invited tosend delegates for the purpose of arranging the co-ordination ofthe work In connection with marketing, and to-consider the proposal of appointing a Depot or Depots to be under the control of theCounty Societies.Rabbits - A special investigation has been made into the causeof the heavy mortality among tame rabbits in the Isle of Wight.About 50 to 40 rabbitries were inspected, and the disease in practically every instance&quot;, was found to be oocoldlosis.   Thenature of the disease was explained to the owners and suggestions as to preventive methods were given.   This Investigation has proved very useful as it has shown the urgent need for explaining to rabbit keepers how it is possible to keep rabbits on naturalproducts without having recourse to cereals.Vegetable Cultivation.  12 group3 of allotments and 4 groups ofsmall holdings have been visited and examined with a view to ascertaining the chief needs of such holders.   Advice has beengiven oh soil cultivation and manuring.          Arrangements are being made for the DepartmentsInspectors to attend special conferences convened by the horticultural Sub-Committees with a view to arranging an organisedsystem of technical instruction during the coming autumn and winter.
                       TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land,   A visit was made to a farm In LIndsey  (lines and recommendations made as to the procedure which might be  adopby the Agricultural Executive Committee  in order to secure adequatcultivation.Recovery of Agricultural Land,   A fairly considerable are r  of high quality agricultural land in Oxfordshire and adjoiningcounties, which has been mined for iron  during the war, has  been temporarily ruined for agricultural purposes.   Before the warthe mining was done mainly by hand labour, and after the operatloithe ground was left in practically the same condition  as before.The Introduction of steam navvies, however, has resulted in  theland left after mining being composed of a mixture of soil,  sub-sand rock, which is entirely unsuitable for cropping.   Experiment:have, therefore, been started to ascertain the best and quickestmeans of restoring such land to cultivation.   Two general methodof restoration are being tested;-  (1) cultivations, (2) additionorganic matter to the soil.   The latter is being carried out in three ways:- the addition of farmyard manure, the ploughing  In ofgreen leguminous crops, and the ploughing in of non-leguminous crThe trials are being conducted in co-operation with the BrymboSteel Works, who have placed land for the purpose at the disposalof the Department, and have agreed to carry out the necessarycultivations and other operations at their own expense.   Theproblem derives additional Importance from the fact that considerareas of devastated land in France and Belgium call for earlyrestoration, and also because of the likelihood that iron miningin this country will in future be on a larger scale than was thecase before the war.                               LABOUR DIVISION.          The controlled labour now on farm work In England  andWales is as follows:-
        Soldiers .........................  70,998        Land Army Women ..................  13,258        Prisoners of War.................  30,515        War Agricultural Volunteers ......   3,904        Miscellaneous ....................    r 490                                          119,165        Four weeks ago the total number                             was .........111,036 Demobilisation.   The Department are making the necessary&quot;arrangements with the Ministry of Labour  with regard to  the release of pivotal men in advance of general demobilisation. Ploughmen for Autumn Cultivations.   The military authorities have now agreed to increase  the number of  ploughmen originally sent out on two months1 agricultural furlough to  assist  with  , autumn cultivations.  General instructions are being issued that all ploughmen at home irrespective of category,  are to be returned at once to their county  of origin for such work. It is expected that this decision will make available immediately about 6,000 additional soldier ploughmen. Harvest Labour.  The number  of soldiers specially released for harvest work and still out on farms  is 3,092.  In addition, 5,783 prisoners of war are still out on harvest  work.    The majority of both classes of labour are engaged on potato lifting.           250 additional soldiers are being sent  immediately to the Distribution Centre at Peterborough to help in the lifting of the remainder of the potato harvest in  the  Holland Division of Lincolnshire and in the Isle of Ely. War Agricultural Volunteers.   The number  of War  Agricultural Volunteers at present on farm work is 3,904.  The Ministry of National Service has decided to release all these men Irom their enrolment, and a letter Is being sent to each  volunteer, informing him of this decision.  Subsistence allowances  granted to these men by the Ministry will be  discontinued as  from the L4th December or at such earlier date as the volunteer may leave his present employment.   Many  of these men  have already left their employment now  that recruiting  is suspended,  but It is expected that a  number  will remain in agriculture, at any
rate for some time.Danes *  The number of Danish agricultural workers placed to date [235, namely 218 agriculturists and 17 blacksmiths.                      Women&apos;s Branch.IfRecruiting.  The Women1 s War Agricultural Committees have beenasked to maintain a very high physical standard in regard tp any fresh applicants for entry in the Women&apos;s Land Army.Training and Employment.  The demand for woman labour is at presetequal to the supply.  Attacks of influenza have been numerousamong women of the Land Army, and have necessitated the curtailmeiof several efficiency tests and other arrangements.          14,754 women are accounted for in the Land Army asfollows:-               Lent to Forage Department .............    109               Lent to Timber Supplies Department  ....   . 124               In Instruction Centres ................    670               On Farm Work ...........................13,258               Waiting for references to be placed  in                      Training Centres...............     72.

The decrease!the numbers is owing to the fact that the period for which womenenrolled, ha3 in many cases -expired.                         CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor Scheme.   The following statement shows the position withregard to the provision of tractors,  machinery and implements ovmeby the Department for the week ended 16th November, 1918:-                                         No. consigned  Total No.                                         during week,  with count!

The acreage dealt vith during the past week is asfollows:-  Ploughed 7,571 acres, cultivated 1,480 acres,  harrowed314 acres, mole drained 52 acres.  Total 9,417 acres.Harvesting Machinery.  7 additional threshing machines have been supplied to counties during the week ended 16th November, making thetotal number consigned to date 362.                          SUPPLIES DIVISION.Fertilisers.  The production and deliveries of sulphate of ammonia,superphosphate and ground basic slag for the five months  ending31st October, make up a total which is considerably in excess ofboth the production and deliveries in the same period last year. Inthe case of compound fertilisers the figures show little  variation,but the trade in these materials takes place mainly in the spring.The aggregate deliveries of the four fertilisers taken together is30 per cent higher during the five months.than in the same periodlast year.  The figures are as follows                                    Production         Deliveries.                                  4 months June 1st - September 30th.                                 1^I7^IB* 1313^X3-&quot;IglT-lg  1318-19,                                   tons&quot;&quot;     Tons      Tons    &quot;Tons-     Sulphate of Ammonia........ 114,147   122,930      76,910  88,580     Superphosphate ............ 155,122   198,443      59,985 100,993     Ground Basic Slag ......... 192,701   245,278     186,879 238,594     Compound Fertilisers ...... 111,413   128,752      50,259  53,239Silos.  Since last May the Department has conducted propaganda with aview to securing the increased erection of silos for storing forage
crops, but a temporary check has been caused by the impossibility of securing cement for re-inforced concrete.  It is also felt th-full tests of the various types built may well be made before tbcampaign is renewed.- At the Departments suggestion the Hon.Rupert Guinness is carrying out researches (for the first time itEngland) in a standard silo which has been built on hi3 estates,to the effect and extent of the temperature rise in 3ilage withspecial apparatus.  Further experiments are about to be undertakewith a view to the increased production and preservation of thelactic acid which has hitherto been wastedi  The results, if satisfactory, will have an important bearing on the commercial vsof silage to the farmer.Demobilisation of Expert Seedsmen,  All the principal seed firmsEngland and Wales are being asked to forward to the Departmentparticulars of any of their expert seedsmen or pivotal men now serving, whose early release from military service they desire.Seed Wheat.  The stocks of seed wheat required for the reclaimedareas in Belgium are being secured as rapidly as possible-, and itis hoped that shipments will commence in the course of the preseimonth.Seed Potatoes.  The  recommendation of the Seeds Sub-Committee ofPotato Advisory Committee to the effect that no maximum price aridressing should be fixed for seed potatoes  of the  1918 crop hastaccepted by the Ministry of Food.                           I am,                                Sir,                                    Your  obedient  Servant,Director-General.  -The Rt. Hon.
