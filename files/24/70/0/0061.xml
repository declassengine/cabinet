DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION FOR IRELAND.

FOOD PRODUCTION SC? IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s

Minute of 17th March, 1917.

---------------------------

Week ended 20th November, 1918.

--------------------------

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased ? Production in Ireland :-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Eleven applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the ?st week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£100,?.

COMPULSORY ? REGULATIONS.

Arrangements are now being made with a view to carrying out the inspections required under Regulation No. 3 of the Regulations under the Third Schedule of the Corn Production Act, 1917. A copy of these Regulations is attached. These inspections are a necessary preliminary to the service of notices on occupiers of holdings of the Department&apos;s intention to make certificates specifying the amounts which, in their opinion, should be paid by way of penalty by those occupiers who have failed, without reasonable cause, to cultivate the minimum tillage portions of their holdings in the year 1918.

The Department are in consultation with the Government regarding the terms of the Tillag? Order applying to holdings in the year 1919, to be made under the Third Schedule of the Corp Production Act 1917. The proposals of the Department have already been indicated int he weekly report dated 6th November, 1918.

After careful consideration the Department have arrived at the conclusion that at the present ? it would be unde?rable, in the national interests, to withdraw the Regulations made ? the Defence of the Realm Acts for enforcing the cultivation of holdings in Ireland, and for providing land for cultivation in allotments in Urban Districts. (The Regulations in question are 2L and ?F.) The question of applying these Regulations in the year 1919 will again be considered at a later stage.

The collection of rents from persons to whom lands were sot in conacre on holdings entered on by the Department, under Regulation 2L. is not yet completed. This work as well as the restering of possession of such lands to the occupiers is proceeding smoothly on the whole.

PROGRESS OF ?

The weather during the past week was very favourable. Except in a few districts, the lifting of the potato crop is now practically completed.  In view of reports from certain districts where potatoes apparently sound when pitted were found after a short time to contain diseased tubers, the necessity for careful sorting to exclude diseased specimens; and ventilation of clamps to prevent sweating, is being impressed upon ?ers.

The extended use of machinery by Irish farmers under the conditions which have arisen since ? the inception of the Department1s propaganda in favour of increased tillage is very remarkable and is exemplified by the following attracts from reports:-

"An unprecedented demand for small hand-power crushing machinery and every plant in the district is kept      busy".

"General satisfaction is expressed at the work done by the oil engines and finishing thrashing mills          recently introduced".

"Two grinding plants have recently been fitted up in the town here and several others have been fitted up  throughout the district".

The lifting of the turnip crop is proceeding in several districts. In one case in Co. Longford a field sown early in April has yielded 36 tons per statute acre. The average yield of the crop will, however, be low.

It would appear that, as advised by the Department earlier in the year, farmers are placing orders and taking delivery of the Basic Slag and Sulphate of Ammonia required for ? in ?ing. The Department have issued a notice warning farmers as to the necessity for proper storni? of these fertilisers.

FLAX.

Scutching Results. From the reports which continue to be received it now appears to be clearly established that yields of scutched flax are much under average.

Prospects for 1919. From various causes, including poor yields, labour difficulties, losses due to bad harvest weather in connection with the 1918 crop, and (since the Armistice was signed) to the doubt now prevailing as to whether remunerative prices will be obtained for next season&apos;s crop, farmers are showing a decided tendency towards sowing a much smaller area of fla? next year.

Scutching Operations. These have been interrupted to a considerable extent owing to the prevalence of influenza among scutchers. In some mills work has been entirely suspended from this cause. As there is now very little labour trouble, and as the weather is at present good and permits of fl? being delivered freely and in good condition at the scutch mills scutching operations are proceeding without any interruptions except, those due to the epidemic. Owing to the poor quality of this year&apos;s crop and to the fact that farmers are reciving an increase of 5/- per stone for their flax, the scutchers are agitating to have their rate of wages raised 2/- per stones of flax scutched.

There is also a demand for commensation by flax growers


whose flax crops were an entire failure owing to the poor quality of the seed sown or to the unfavourable weather conditions in the spring combined with attacks of the flax beetle.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 12th to 18th instant, inclusive, 260 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 90 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks and 160 applications for licences to export milch cows were received.
