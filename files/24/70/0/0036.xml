                           MEMORANDUM BY MR.  LONG.     CERTAIN memoranda have been  recently received  in the Colonial  Office whichindicate that the  question  of establishing-  some  form of international control for&quot; Equatorial Africa&quot; is being  considered in  other  Government Departments.  Thesememoranda appear  to be the outcome of the Board  of Trade paper (G.T.-3313) whichwas circulated to the Cabinet on the 11th January,  1918, and  as a scheme of the kindsuggested  in that  paper may be  brought  forward in  connection  with the peacenegotiations, it  seems  desirable that  I should   furnish my  colleagues  with  myobservations upon it without delay.     The Board of Trade state  that an international status has already existed in germin the regime set up by the Berlin and  Brussels Acts, and that the pre-war system of guarantees  for equal commercial  treatment,  suppression of slavery, liquor traffic, &amp;c.,provided by those Acts might be developed,  without impairing the sovereign lights or administrative autonomy of the various colonies.     The Berlin  Conference was the outcome of the scramble among the great european powers for  Africa, and  its chief purpose  was to arrive at an  understanding  withreference to the Congo  Basin, Avhich was  then under the control of the InternationalCongo Association.   Provision  was made in  the Act of the Conference for freedom oftrade  in  the Conventional Basin  and the  free   navigation  of the  Congo,   for the&quot;suppression of the  slave trade within  its territories, and for their  neutrality in certain eventualities.  There were also provisions relating  to the  navigation of the Niger andand one or two other matters.     It is unnecessary to trace the steps by which the International State of the Congohas been converted into a  Belgian Colony.     In the course of the ten years succeeding 1895 the international character of the zone covered by the Berlin Act was still further modified.  The system of concessionsintroduced  into the Congo Free State by King Leopold  was  entirely contrary to thespirit  of  the Act,  not only  in its disregard for the rights of the natives, but in its practical abrogation over an immense area of the system of free and equal trade for the sake of which  the &quot;Free State&quot; was  founded.   The  attempts  made to induce the signatory  Powers  to  intervene  only  led  to  the realisation  of  the unsatisfactorycharacter of an international  State, and to  the conclusion that  the  best prospect ofgood government lay in the transfer of the Congo Free State to the direct sovereignty of Belgium.  It will  be  seen therefore that,  as  regards the  administration of the Congo and  freedom of trade, internationalism proved a failure.     No effective steps were taken to  suppress the slave trade,  and the matter was reconsidered by the International  Conference which met at Brussels in  1889.     The provisions relating to the neutrality of the Conventional Basin failed entirely as soon as  they were subjected to a  practical  test during  the  present war.   The regulations relating to the navigation of the  Niger proved to be otiose.     The Berlin Act, therefore, furnishes but cold  comfort to the  internationalists, and our experience of the working of the Brussels Act has hardly been more encouraging.     The Brussels  Act  is a purely humanitarian  convention.  It was the outcome of  -&apos; the crusade preached by Cardinal Lavigerie  against the  slave-trade, and nearly all its provisions  relate to that matter,  but the suppression of the slave  trade was mainly,  if not entirely, brought about by the gradual  extension of European administration from the coast to the interior,  &amp;c.,and not by any international action  taken by the Powers. in fulfilment of their  obligations under the Act.      The Act, however, dealt with two  subsidiary questions, in which some semblance of international co-operation has been maintained,  namely, the sale of trade spirits and of arms and ammunition to the natives within the zone  comprised between  the 20th parallel of north latitude  and the 22nd parallel of  south latitude in fact, the whole  of Tropical Africa.      In East Africa  the liquor trade had  always been  non-existent, and steps were merely taken to preserve the  eastern portion of the zone as a prohibition area.   This,        [1000]                                                              B
however,  was  only  a  maintenance of  the   status  quo,  and  did  not involve  any international act of suppression.     In West Africa the liquor trade was one of long  standing in the coast districts;awl the policy was to restrict it  in  those districts by the imposition of import  duties and  to prevent it from penetrating  into the  districts in  the  interior.  In  the formercase international co-operation seemed to be  both desirable and practicable; desirable,because any substantial difference  in Customs duties would  give rise  to  smugglingacross the long and unprotected land frontiers which separated the numerous  possessionsfrom  one another;  practicable,  because the  surf-beaten coast of West Africa is ill-provided  with  ports,  and  the  control  of  imports at  these few  landing-places  is comparatively  simple   At  the  Conference  the  British  representatives  suggested aminimum import duty  of 200 fr, per hectolitre, but owing to the opposition of othercountries this was eventually whittled down  to the  almost nominal  duty of lofr. perhectolitre, or about Id. per gallon.  In 1890  the question of the  liquor trade in WestAfrica was taken  up with  vigour by Mr. Joseph  Chamberlain, at that time Secretaryof State for  the  Colonies;  and  in the  early  part  of 1897 Lord  Salisbury  addressed,through the Belgian Government, an invitation to the signatory Powers of the general act to attend a Conference at Brussels.   The Conference did not meet until  1899. thusaffording  an  instructive  instance  of the  cumbrous  and dilatory methods of inter-nationalism.   A  minimum  duty  of 100 fr. per hectolitre  was proposed by  the british representatives, but, after a long wrangle, a minimum duty of  75 fr.  per hectolitre was eventually agreed to, with an exceptional duty of 60 fr. per hectolitre for Togoland andthe adjoining French  possession of Dahomey.   In  1906 a  second  Conference was held,and the minimum duty of 100 fr. per hectolitre was at length  accepted by the Powers,but difficulties arose with  the Portuguese representatives  in regard to the excise dutyon the liquors distilled in Angola, and only an unsatisfactory compromise  was arrivedat on this subject.  Again, after a long correspondence, a third Conference was held in1912 to concert measures  for preventing the traffic from penetrating into  the districtswhich had hitherto remained untouched by it, but this proved entirely abortive.     Thus, although nearly  thirty years  have elapsed since the main Conference met,the Powers, acting together, have only advanced half way  towards the minimum dutywhich Great Britain suggested at the very outset; but since 1906, acting independentlyand with no assistance  from any Conference,  the  Powers principally  concerned haveincreased their duties to amounts far in  excess  of what they failed to  agree upon.The  duty in  the  British  West  African  Colonies  is now  over 200 fr.  per  hectolitre.Similarly, while no agreement has been  reached as to the steps to be taken  to preventthe spread of the traffic to those districts in West  Africa which are at present free from it, each Power has independently established such zones of prohibition as it  considered desirable.     In the case of the arms traffic the results have been even more  unedifying.   TheGeneral Act imposed  restrictions on the  importation into Tropical  Africa of arms  andammunition, especially of  arms  of precision, on  account  of the  &quot; pernicious  andpreponderating part played by fire-arms in slave trade operations, as well as in intestinewars between native tribes.&quot;  As the slave trade gradually disappeared the  preventionof inter-tribal fighting and the protection  of the  local administration against nativerisings  became the  governing  considerations, and in cases  where there was  any considerable native population self-interest was sufficient to ensure that the regulationswere well observed.     This was the case in West Africa ;  but the position was far different in North-EastAfrica, where French Somaliland, with a territory so small and sparsely populated as torender it indifferent to the results of a trade in arms, served  as a distributing  centre for arms of precision to the adjoining countries. With a view  to relieving a dangerous situation a Conference  was assembled at Brussels, after prolonged negotiation, for thepurpose of reconsidering the question of the arms traffic in  Tropical Africa.   The sequelis best described  in  the  following extract from  a letter which was sent from theColonial Office to the Foreign Office on  the 13th of March, 1909 :-         &quot; The injury done to British interests both in India and Somaliland by the     traffic is one of long standing, and when the expiration of the period fixed for the     revision of the  articles of the General Act of the Brussels Conference  1889-90 at     last seemed  to offer an opportunity of obtaining some  relief from a state of affairs     which was rapidly becoming intolerable,  the  French  Government,  availing them-     selves  of a  technical  objection,  postponed  for as long  a period as possible the     assembly of the new International Conference at Brussels.&quot;
          &quot; When the Conference at last met, that Government  used  every effort to.     render its proceedings  abortive.&quot;          *       *      *       *       *       *       *      *       w          &quot; As Sir E. Grey is aware, the Conference  was adjourned in  the  middle of     last year in order that  an attempt might be made to arrive at a friendly settlement     with France,  but  the negotiations  which  have been  opened with the French     Government show no sign of a  satisfactory  conclusion, and the  object of that     Government would appear to be to prolong them indefinitely in the hope that the     whole matter will die a natural death.&quot;     Nine years have elapsed since this letter was  written and the question of the arms-traffic in North-East Africa  is still awaiting a satisfactorv solution.     It seems clear, from the   foregoing,  that if it is  desired  to  base the case forinternationalism upon the working of the Berlin and Brussels Acts, it rests upon a veryslender foundation.  It may also be pointed out that, in  the  case  of the  Brussels Actand to a certain extent of the Berlin Act, the Powers were supposed to be actuated bydisinterested motives, and that, if internationalism has achieved so little  under theseconditions, the results will be still more unsatisfactory in matters  which are governedpurely by considerations of self-interest.     Finally, there is the Declaration of  the 2nd July, 1890, appended to  the general act of the Brussels Conference.    The Declaration fixed a  maximum duty of 10 per cent.ad valorem  for imports into the Conventional Basin,  and is stated  by the Board ofTrade to be a great approach to an international  scheme  of equal rates of Customsduties throughout the area in question.  It was not  intended to give  effect  to  a far-reaching scheme of  international commercial policy,  but  merely to provide the variousadministrations  in  the Conventional  Basin with the  means  of carrying  out their obligations under the General  Act. the maximum  rate of  duty being fixed  as low  aspossible in order to conciliate the Powers which had no territorial interests in the Congo,but which had previously traded freely there.  In any  case the arrangement does notappear to have  proved an  unmixed  benefit, for  in 1913 the  Belgian Governmentsuggested to His Majesty&apos;s Government that it should be revised, and the maximum of10 per cent, increased.  The local British Administrations  in  the Conventional  Basinwere in favour of the  proposal.   The  French,  Italian, and Portuguese  Governmentsgave their consent  to  it, and in the  early  part  of  1914  His  Majesty&apos;s government informed  the Belgian Government that they agreed to the principle of a  revision  of the brussels  Declaration.   Even this  survival of a  mild form  of internationalism wastherefore  in danger of destruction when the present war  broke out.     In fact, taking the Berlin and Brussels Acts as  a whole, many of their  provisionshave never come into operation, many  more have  been  useless for the purposes forwhich  they were framed, while in the one  or two  cases in  which some  appearance ofinternational co-operation has been maintained, the results  after many years&apos;  trial havebeen so disappointing as to  discourage any  desire  for the  further extension  of theprinciple of internationalism.     The Colonial Office, at any rate, would see without regret the disappearance of the berlin Act and the  Brussels  Declaration  of 2nd July, 1890, and, with  regard  to  thesmall remnant of the Brussels Act which is still operative, it is strongly of opinion thatthe time has come when it should be laid down as a guiding principle for future action that the only Powers reasonably entitled to a voice in arrangements for  the welfare of african natives are those which have territories in  the African continent.     To return, however, to  the  Board of Trade suggestions, it is stated  that the  first and  most  essential  economic feature  of any international league will  naturally be a customs  Convention  prescribing  equality  of   Customs  treatment,  and   completecommercial freedom within  the Conventional Area, and equality of treatment in all respects of the trade and shipping of the contracting States ; that a great approach to a.regime of equal rates of Customs duties was made  by the Brussels Declaration of 1890 ;and  that,  taking a long view, it will be to the advantage of our trade in the  future  tohave security for equal Customs duties throughout the whole area.     As the Board of Trade recognises, such a system is  incompatible with any systemof &quot; preference&quot; to the products of other parts of the Empire  imported into tropical africa.  Even if it  were desirable to institute  a  system  of free trade  and equalcustoms duties throughout the whole of Tropical Africa, it is quite unnecessary to set on foot a new and cumbrous international organisation for the purpose.  The Berlin Actand the Anglo-French  Convention of 14th  June, 1898 (with its  extension to  additional\
  territory in virtue  of the  Anglo-French  Declaration  of 21st  March,  1881),  and  to other Powers  in  virtue of most-favoured-nation  treaties)  practically  provide  for  a non-preferential system  throughout the greater part of Tropical  Africa, and it would  be simpler to maintain  the provisions of the  Berlin  Act relating to free trade, and  if  necessary, to negotiate  for an extension  of the ten  years  which the  Convention  and  Declaration have still to run than to make a fresh start.  -       With regard to the proposed establishment of a single Customs tariff for the whole  of Tropical Africa,  the  Board of Trade does not state its grounds  for  considering that  such ;in arrangement would be to the advantage of our trade in the future, but, having       &quot;11-         , ,             o  regard  to the  varying conditions of development,  race, &amp;c, throughout this vast  area, any scheme of the kind must appear to  those who  have had practical  experience  of the administration of these territories to be quite  unworkable, while the scheme for  the establishment of an 11 equalisation fund &quot; under an International Customs Board can  only be  regarded as chimerical.   As, however, the case  for internationalism has been  mainly built up by the Board of Trade on  the proposal for a single Customs tariff, and  this in its turn is  recognised  to  depend for its success on the International Customs  Board, it is necessary to go more fully into the matter and  to point out some of the more  obvious difficulties.      A somewhat similar experiment has already been  tried in another part  of Africa.  The International Commission which was established in 1876 for the Egyptian -Caisse de  la Dette consisted of the representatives of six Powers only,  and was concerned with  a  single homogeneous territory of small dimensions, when compared  with the vast terri-  tories included in  Tropical Africa.  It is a matter of common knowledge that the Corn-  mission became a hot-bed of intrigue,  that it  was a perpetual thorn in  the side of the  British Agent, and  that it was one of the greatest obstacles to the proper development  of the country.  Matters were only placed on a satisfactory basis in 1904 when the Caisse  was deprived of the greater part  of its previous functions.      We may well wonder  what the result would be of throwing the Customs  revenue  of Tropical Africa, with its numerous administrations, its  vast territories in  varying  stages of development, and   all  its racial, economic, aad other differences, into the &apos;&quot; dead hand &quot; of an International Customs  Board consisting  of the representatives of some twelve Powers.  Factions would be formed among the different Powers, intrigue would be rampant, and even if Germany were excluded,  she  might still  be able to  use some friendly Power to further her designs.  Nor is it clear  how it is proposed to justify, for instance, to the white settler in East Africa the diversion of his Custom duties to an ill-administered country like Liberia, or to  the native of the  Gold Coast  or  Nigeria  a diversion of his duties to some other African dependency  about  which  he knows little and cares less.      But all this would be as nothing compared with the  fight for the &quot; spoils.&quot;  The Board might be called upon to adjudicate between the claims of a scheme for a  railway in Senegal, for a deep water wharf in East Africa, and a programme of road construction in the Congo. Assuming that the  Board were  in a position  to decide between conflicting claims of this kind without  prolonged  personal investigation on the spot, it is not diffi- cult to conceive the recriminations which would ensue between the different claimants. The Board of Trade recognise that difficulties  of this  kind would arise, and state  that it would &quot; be necessary to set up some arbitral  machinery,  e.g.,  The Hague  Tribunal, for dealing with questions between States arising under the Convention, and it would be possible to give this  Tribunal the power  of awarding  damages  out  of  the Customs Revenue.&quot;  Allowing  for the time required  for the presentation  of the cases  to the Board, for their examination and the Board&apos;s award, and for the  proceedings beibre the arbitral Tribunal, years  would be  consumed before a  final decision could be arrived  at. To import complications of this kind into  the ordinary routine of colonial administration is really  not practical politics.  The whole of this  elaborate and clumsy machinery would fall to pieces  at the  first  practical test, and  the  scheme wrould be doomed to failure from the outset.                                        i     The  Board of Trade anticipate that the  new Convention would also provide  for such  matters as the traffic in liquor  and arms, the proper  treatment of natives, and the limitation of armaments.  Enough  has  already been  said above with regard  to the first three of these questions.   The  last is  part  of a bigger question  relating  to the restriction of armaments generally, and  the  present memorandum  is not  a suitable place for its discussion.     The Board  of Trade then go on to suggest that matters relating to mining and concessions might be.entrusted to the International Customs Board with a view to the-enactment of a common Mining and Concessions Code.  So  far as the experience of the
Colonial Office is of any value, it would  have been  scarcely possible to select  a moreunpromising subject for international treatment.  In 1912 the then Secretary of Statefor the Colonies  appointed a committee of experts, under a most capable chairman, &quot; toconsider the laws in force in the West African Colonies  and Protectorates (other thanNorthern  Nigeria)  regulating  the  conditions under which rights over  land  or the produce thereof may be transferred, and to report  whether  any, and  if  so what,amendment of the laws is required, either  on the lines  of the Northern Nigeria  LandProclamation or  otherwise.&quot;     A vast amount of evidence was taken, but the system of West African land tenureproved to  be so varied and  complicated that at the end of three years, when the warput an end to their sittings, the Committee had been  unable  to  come to any  general conclusion.   The  outlook  is  not hopeful for an  inquiry extending  to  the whole of tropical Africa and conducted by a Board of twelve representatives of different nations,each of them under the influence of special prejudices, interests, &amp;c.     In fact, internationalism in a mild form, and assisted by humanitarian  considera-tions, has  proved, on the whole, a dismal failure in Tropical Africa, and  neither past experience nor the logic of things gives any ground for anticipating better results froma more developed form of the regime.  I could be no party  to any arrangements of thekind proposed, which in my judgment would paralyse our  administrations in tropical africa, and I trust  that the fo egoing observations will satisfy my colleagues of thenecessity of firmly opposing them from whatever quarter they may be advanced.                                                                   W. H.  L.     Colonial Office,           November 16, 1918.
