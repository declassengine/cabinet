(b)  The Army state that they do not require the               ports of Ostend, Zeebrugge and Bruges if               they are allowed to use Antwerp for War               purposes.          (c)  The Army state that if they cannot use Antweip               for War purposes, they are unable to say               whether they require Ostend,  Zeebrugge and               Bruges until it has been ascertained how               soon these ports can be ready for use.          (d)  As the bringing into use of the ports will               be a gradual one,     &apos;* .  the increase in               tonnage and the maximum tonnage which it is               anticipated can be dealt v/ith in those ports               at dates in the near future is being investi-               gated,          (e)  The British have given a promise to the               Belgians to do such work as is necessary for               War purposes, but have not committed themselves               to carry out any work beyond this.3         The points requiring Cabinet decision arising outof the state of affairs described in paragraph 2 are:-          (a)  Can Antwerp be used a3 a Military Port?               (it is suggested that the Foreign Office               should settle this matter with the Dutch               Government at as early a date  as possible),          (b)  In the event of its being settled that Antwerp               may be used for Military purposes,  are the               British Government to undertake the repairs               of the remainder of the ports  for civilian               purposes for; the Belgians,  and if so, to               what extent?..,     In this event, are the               Belgians to be asked to repay  any expenditure               on the work?.It/
     (It is suggested that the Foreign Office should      negotiate with the Belgian Government on this  point),          (c)  In the case of work done for Military               purposes are the Belgians to repay the coit               of this to the British,  and if so,  who is               to inform them?.     (It is suggested that this should also be discussed  by      the Foreign Office with the Belgian Government,4         It is suggested that any repairs undertaken shouldbe limited to such works as will not necessitate theretention of British Staff and workmen beyond the  periodof six months.(Signed!
