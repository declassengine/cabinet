Po 1 i11oa 1 1 r.iteHigonQg &apos;1)Dmi-m0uIForeign Office,Prance /;)06.(331-11 E II 0 R A IP P U MenTHE CHARGE   It may perhaps be worth while to make a summary of the speech                     a.delivered by LI.  Lesco&amp;ve before tho Senate on the 29th -October  demand-ing the or) en ing  of an &apos; instruction&apos; against IT. Caillaux and those who areaccused with him, with a view &quot;b their trial before the Seriate.   On theconclusion of the speech aa order was at once made as demanded.   Thiswas of course a  foregone conclusion:  but the French procedurerequires that the High Court,  that is the Senate, should formally acceptthe duty of trying persons sent before it.    It may bo noted that the oasof Oaillaux differs from that of Ualvy,  in that the latter was, at hisown requestf sent by the Chamber for trial before the Senate, while it isa Presidential decree issued by the Government which invites tho  HighCourt to try Oaillaux.   He is to be tried with two others, the deputyLoustalot,  one of his political followers, and a lawyer named Coraby, whohas  long  been closely associated with him.    All three are accused of&quot;intelligence with the erien$ 11 the penalty for which is death.  the prisoners have been in custody since last January but the delays ofFrench  legal  procedure are such that it is said that the actual trialoccupying more than fourteen col umns of the  &quot;Journal  des Debats&quot;  ofOctober 30th.  Tho following  seem to be the  points of chief  importancein it.   M, Lescouve begins by speaking of the unfortunate occurrences in theItalian and French armies in 1917 which forced attention to the pacifistVampai^n carried on in both countries by certain  individuals  and news-papers.   As light came gradually to be thrown on this campaign,andwill  not  take niace before January or February.The indictment read by the prosecuting counsel is of great  length,
scandal after scandal was ? circumstance appeared.

All the accused, Almere?da, Duval, ?, the whole Bonnet Rouge gang, Balo, Lenior, Cavallini, and others, had one thing at least in common: they were all in relations more or less intimate with Cailloux. The Bonnet Rouge began to be defaitiste in the spring of 1916. Caillaux&apos; letters show him still in friendly correspondence with its editor in March 1917. (Almereyda, it will be remembered, died mysteriously in prison after his arrest). Landau, another of the gang, since convisted and sentenced to eight years peanl servituda, founded in 1917 a paper called "La Tranchée Républicatine" which fomented pacifism and mutinies. Caillaux was one of those who found him the money to do so. With Balo, he continued his relations, even after Bolo was subject to police supervision and under the gravest suspicion of high treason. So as to Cavallini. ?

We find Caillaux with Loustalot and Comby lunching with Cavallini in Paris in November 1916; and, shortly after, Caillaux goes to meet Cavallini in Rome and a few weeks later Cavallini meets Loustalot and Comby at Lausanne and presents them to the ex-Khedive, who is well know to have acted as a German agent.

These argues N. Lescouve, are at least very suspicious circumstances and they led to the demand being made by M. Clemenceau&apos;s Ministry in 1917 for the suspension of M. Caillau?&apos;s parliamentary immunity. After arguing that there is no substance in the contention now made on behalf of M. Caillaux that this suspension only permits of a trial for having attempted to break up the alliances of France, and not on one for intelligence with the enemy, he proceeds to set forth the results of the investigations carried out by Captain Bouchardon since Caillaux&apos; ?rrest in January. He divides them into three heads: Caillaux&apos;s political action relating to the war (politique de guerre): his rela? with German agents: his pacifist propaganda in France and Italy.


     As to his political action the chief evidence ia  provided bythe documents&apos; seized in I. Caillaux1s aafe at Florence,    One oftheae is a paper in hie own hand called &quot;Lea Reaponsables:   laGuerre et la Paix&quot;, in which he argues that Germany only  halfdeeired the war and that the responsibility for it rests  far more on the French press.   This paper was written in April 1915, andfrom its arguments as to the general  A&amp;feats of coalitions,  ap-pears to show that M. Caillaux not only condemned  the  Allies forgoing into the war, hut thought they  had already lost  it.  MOT:important than this document, which seems at worst to  show only an unpatriotic state of mind, is a paper containing Caillaux&apos;&apos;programme of action prepared for the  moment when,  as ho expected.he would again be Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of peace.This programme, aays M. Lesc^Uve, if  one of peace  abroad  is  oneof civil war at home.   It is certainly a most extraordinary one.If the war continued all the generals (tout le personnel  de^commandants d&apos;Jarm?es) were to he changed:  the civil authority  ofprefects etc.&apos;, to be restored;  the Chamber prorogued;  nCertainregimentsir brought to Paris:  the direct and indirect  authors  ofthe war arrested and a ministry of 1g&amp;fe men&apos; appointed,   nothing was to be done about the conditions of peace without a specialmandate from the country.   Either a  national assembly (of thetwo Chambers) was to be convoked or a dissolution  secured andelections held on a governmental programme of peace-  The peace treaty was to include various clauses aimed at making  future warsImpossible.   The document proceeds,  under the heading &apos;Rubicon&apos;(the name used by Napolean III for his plan ,of coup dfetat)  tostate that a law should then if possible be voted  giving  thePresident of the Republic power to issue decrees having force  oflaw even if they infringe the constitution,, (ayant force  legis-lative et constitutionelle)Landau and Aimereyda are named
as persons whose services will be useful:   and CeccaldKCaillaux&apos;lawyer wh-i-se death is announced to-day,  Uov,  7th) was to  he prefect&apos;of police.   Certain journalists were to he arrested and,  again,certain regiments brought to Paris.   On the assembling of the Chambersthey will be made to vote (on leur imnosera) the law called Rubicon.   It appears that confronted with this  document in his examinationCaillaux regretted the folly of using the word Rubicon:  but took the obvious line of defence that the law does not forbid, a private citizento put his political idea on paper,   It is said, however,  though M,Lescouve did net raise this point, that  the document is signed and thatthis is proof of the intention to communicate it to others, and infact, of conspiracy.   The astonishing thing, to English  political eyes,is that this revelation of an intention  to establish personal government not denied by Caillaux, has not filled his friends among  the ExtremeLeft with rage at his treachery to the republican ideas he has alwaysprofessed.   They still defend him and pnoh-pcoh the charges against him.   M/. Lescouve then proceeds to allude  to discoveries;of Caillaux1spre-war negotiations with Germany as found in German documents as towhich he refuses to give any explanation saying that he is bound, tosecrecy by his oath as a Minister,   He then turns to the relations with the enemy which Caillaux soindignantly denies in his speech,   At the outbreak of war Caillaux was  Mobilised at his own request;but getting on badly with the military authorities he was sent  in Kovem-ber to South America and landed at Rio de  Janeiro on 5th December 1914.About this time two things happened.   First the how Preie Presse ofHenna wrote an artiole highly praising Caillaux,   Then Caillaux&apos;sformer secretary, Besclaux, was found guilty of embezzlement.   These events perhaps had some influence both on  the fears and activities of tailiaux aTs exhibited in two telegrams of  Bernstorffs obtained and Published by the United States Government.   They state that Buenos Ayre
that  is  Luxburgy; the  German  Minister there   telegraphs thf, t Cid llaftx isleaving  for France  on account  of the Desclaux affair,  that  he speaks withcontempt of French  Ministers,  sees  throughEng lish policy, and hasscarcely altered his  pre-war point  of view,  though he  pretends to believe in  German atrocities.   &quot;He has been grateful for some  indirect polite-tiesses of mine.&apos;   but  says  he is watched and has to bo  careful and depre-cates the praises of  the German papers which ruin him  in France,   He isafraid of assassination&quot;.  A second telegram to the German  admiraltyindicates the  ship  on which  he will sail,  the desirability  of his cap-ture  and the importance of treating him politely.   Howv did Luxbur&quot;gget such  good information about Caillaux?  Throughone Kinotto, as  agent of his who lunched with Caillaux every day.  Thisindividual,  whonwas born in  Berlin, is now undergoing  trial in the  ;United States  and has admitted that he carried messages between Caillaux-and Luxburg referring to a plan for an alliance qf France and Germanyagainst  England  and Russia.   Caillaux was warned against him but. re-fused to listen,  saw  him frequently there, v: nd afterwards received him as  his guest in  France.  But he can hardly have failed to guess what sort  of  man he was:  one who,  as we know on no less authority than thatof  Hugo  Schmidt,  the  German  agent who paid Bolo nis millions, that though he could  pass,  as an Italian  when necessary he was&quot;in reality ofcourse entirely  German&quot;.   Oaillaux first asserted that Luxburg never offered  him any civilitiesbut subsequently declared  that when Mi-notto spoke to him of Luxburg he told  him he could not hear that name mentioned.   Yet  llinotto four months later was staying at  Caillaux&apos;s country-house.&apos;   The next matter  dealt with  by M.beseouve is Caillaux&apos;s relations with one Lipscher whom he  had indeed known well before the  war.   At the out-break of war Lipscher, whom  Caillaux had called to Paris, returnedonce  to  his home in Belgium  and oh  the German arrival  entered into rela-tions with Baron Lancken who had been Seoretary of Embassy  at Paris and
had known Caillaux. Lancken at once began to use Lipscher and sent him in December 1914 to the French, consulate at Geneva where we find him trying to explain the generous concessions Germany is willing to make  to France, and regretting the absence of Caillaux in S. America. But the French Government refused him a passport both on this occasion and on a subsequent attempt made through the French Legation at the Hague. On this Lipscher wrote several letters to  Caillaux to which Caillaux did not reply. He then sent his mistress, Therese Duverger, to Paris where she arrived in October 1915, had at once several interviews  with Caillaux ?at his house, and was the means of enabling Lipscher to carry on a correspondence with him. As to this Caillaux  admitted that he received ?er, on false pretences as he alleges and asserts that on finding that she came to talk of German pourparlers  of peace he said that he had no-?hing to do with such matters, and that he informed M.Viviani and M. Malvy ? and on a later occasion M.Briand. Unfortunately both M. Briadd and M.Viviani deny having ever been told either by Malvy or Caillaux of my such negotiations  M.Malvy remembers something: but then, ? M. ?escouve, we know that Malvy warned Caillaux to be prudent and not to receive the woman.

M. Lescouve? proceeds to quote in full a series of letters from Lipscher to Caillaux which have fallen into the hands of the police or have been fund in the safe at Florence. In them under disguised names (for instance Bencist means the German Government, Jadot is Jagow and Oscar Baron von Lancken) and in the form of discussing a financial transaction. Caillaux is assured of the large concessions Germany is willing to take and of the special favour with which the German Government regards ?im. Some of these letters were sent through Therese  Duverger and  men-?ion her by name.  The most important of them, dated Zurich, 14th November, 1915, purports to speak on behalf of Jagow, the  Secretary  of ?tate, and assures Caillaux that he is in the highest favour  with the German Government and that, though the time may not have come for him to
IrThe next step taken is indicated by two documents found in the safe.,,  typewritten, * says T&apos;, Le-seouv6,  &quot;docs not aopear&quot;-to be all that isfsired (d6sitable) as intermediary.   &apos;I place myself at your disposal4 am authorised to establish the relations you desire&apos;&quot;  The other on it the name and address of H. -\J.!arx, in a writing - proved by theeturn  to  power in F,ance,  ot  would  be  well  for  him to make himself$quainted at  once with  the extraordinarily  good terms Germany is readyo give and that for this  purpose  he  ought to meet a representative of health  German Government..    In contradiction to Caillaux&apos;s statements as to s having repelled Therese Puvcrger  altogether, she has admitted that he;ave her  five  hundred francs,  believed  to be a ore-war debt to Lipschern connection  with the  trial of Madame  Caillaux, while a friend of hersdd Lipscher&apos;s,  one Beauquier,  declares that she told him she was very-ell received  by Caillaux,  who said  that Lipscher&apos;s proposals interestedlim; but  that  he dare not  attempt  going to Switzerland, and that Lipschermst not  be in a hurry.    She  herself admitted,later, that she had seenaillaux  five  times,  and explained that Lipscher was acting for Lancken,aillaux  complained of  Lancken &quot;who  had compromised him before&quot;, but heave her  the impression,  which she reported  to Lipscher, of being  in-lined  to  enter into negotiations,  Questioned  as to all  this,  Caillaux  triumphantly cited the draft of aetter  found in the safe and apparently addressed to Lipscher in which hen&amp;ignantly denlsnes any correspondence with him.   This is of 18th Dvember.&apos;.   But, says Mi  Lescouve,  the  explanation is simple and fatal. letter&quot; from  Lipscher  delivered to  Caillaux on November 16 or 17 was arked  &quot;Opened by the military censor&apos;.  Thus Lipscher, like Minotto, had  served the put;nose for which he rs iployed.   He  had let Caillaux know  that the German Government was anxious  deal with him and he had discovered  that  Caillaux had not changed his e-war views  and though very  nervous,  wvs not disinclined to deal if he &apos;uld do  so safely.
?onnet Rouge affair to br? that of Marx, the well-known German agent at ?erne. Confronted with these documents which he had so strangely pre-?rved among his most secret papers, Caillaux told a story of a person ?inging him up in the spring of 1916 and asking for an interview on financial business, and, on being admitted, handed him these papers, on which, says Caillaux, I immediately showed him the door. "But did you ?ry to arrest him" asked M. Bouchardon? "How could I" replied Caillaux, I was  alone and had no man-servant". M. Lescouve? does not comment on that strikes an Englishman as the weakest part of Caillaux&apos;s story: his ?ailure to inform the authorities of the visit.

The  third part of the indictment deals with Caillaux&apos;s pacifist agitations in France and Italy. It deals first with his relations with Bolo ?hich also date from before, the war. Papers found in the safe show ?aillaux desiring to get control of Le Journal, itis not therefore surprising that we soon find Bolo and Humbert buying the paper. Bolo then goes to America where, according to M. Lescouve, he intrigued with ?ernstorff on Caillaux(s behalf with a view to obtaining support for ringing about political changes in France. Two telegrams sent to ?erlin by Bernst?rff are quoted in support of this view, and are at ?ast open to that interpretation. But as M. Lescouve admits they do ? prove that Caillaux authorised Bolo. to act for him. But at least ?eir relations were very friendly. In January 1917 the prosecution of ?lo for treason Opened though he was not yet arrested: a little  later a discoveries began to be made, a friend who had made some, warned ?illaux whose reply was that Bolo was dining with him that night. It is to Bolo that he referred Dubarry when Dubarry came to him for  money for founding le Pays? so beth Bolo, and Dubarry have admitted, though ?aillaux denied having anything to do with starting Le Pays. So late August 1917 Caillaux is still writing to Bolo and premising to do all can to &apos;stop the Campaign against him&apos;.

The next matter is that of the Bonnet Rouge gang. Letters are
  Mod showing tho intimate-almost affectionate way in which Caillaux  lotc  to  Almcrcyda,   It was in February or March 1916 that Caillaux had  d the interview with  Marx:   it was  in Aoril  and Kay that Duval,  since  :ot;  began  his defaltiste  campaign in  the Bonnet Rouge,  a campaign,  as  : now km-v, .paid for by Germany.   Is this,  asks M.  Lescouv*,  mere coin-  idenoe?    In  July suspicions  are  aroused as to the source of the  funds,  police  enquiry  is  made, and  one  of  the gang  said that Caillaux had  Did them in September  that they would  not be  arrested.    He denies;  wing said  this  but admits having had  ah interview with some of the staff&quot;the paper,  which  actively defended him when other, papers attacked his  mduct in  Italy.    In  January 1917 he  is still writing cordially  to  Imereyda, and at Easter, several  of  the gang  now in goal,  with  Duval,  ince  executed,  called  on him  at his  country-house.    Called on  for anixplanation  after then  were arrested  he denies having influenced the pa-I :er  in any way since the  war,  but  declines to  express any disapprovalIF it.    This  was on Nov., 26th,  1917.3   There  remains  CaillauxTs action in Italy.    He went there in  December 1916 and  was Immediately  in the  closest relations with Cavallini,  ascoundrel who  had been  convicted of fraud In 1898 and sentenced  tcfive years imprisonment,  and Is  now on  trial for treason.    He live surrounded by  this man,, his mistress, and a  cfew of others,  notoriouslyinthe^pay Of  Germany,  many of whom are now  standing their trial.  -Finally he obtained  an  interview with Signor Martini,  who had beencolonial  Minister, to whom, on the  evidence  of Signor Martini&apos;s  diary,k represented  Fiance as  worn  out  for lack of  men and munitions, suf-fering  from  revolution  in Algiers,  and  unable  to continue the  war  be-yond the  autumn.   Besides  France  oannot risk  having the  English Armyin Franne larger  than her own,   Signor Martini objected  the difficultytf the  Pact  of  London,  but  Caillaux said to ask Prance  to go on  was to   the impossible.   France must  have  peace with or without Alsace-Lorraine,  .  Signor Martinirs note,  written an  hour after  the interview,
j ddds  that ho has JIO  -doubt. OaillOAuc ha$l an understanding: with *K?germany and &apos;I ainijl  at  being called to power to make peace,which he would do on very Door  conditions.    All  this,  Lescouve submits,  is a continuous and secret intrigue, con- trary to the policy  adopted by all the Oorernments which have held power in Fiance.   He therefore  demands,  what he obtained, the order for trial.    It must of course not be forgotten that his speech is a speech for the prosecution and  that there may be an answer ti it in the speech for the defence,    But it appears to present a strong case in certain respects.    It seems to make the guilt of Caillaux morally certain,  So many  intrigues with  such associates cannot all have been Innocent.  As to  his  legal guilt some parts of the  speech are not very conclusive.  But it  would appear difficult to escape from the damning evidence about his dealings with Minotto in S-America and with Lipscher and Marx in Paris-
