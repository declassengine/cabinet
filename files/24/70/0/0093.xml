Circulated by the Secretary  of State for India.Ante on  k(  Memorandum  ou our Present and  Future Military  Policy in   Russia,&quot; by the (Uiicf of the  Imperial General  Stall&apos;.   (G.T.  61311).    J. desire to offer some observations on the  Chief ol tlio Imperial General Staffs&quot;Memorandum on our Present and Future Military Policy in Russia.&quot;    It is  very difficult  to see light  in this  question.  Central. Asia is  in.  a Quidcondition.  What we want  to  prevent-from the  Indian  point  of view is  the perpetuation  of disorder which  may extend  to  Persia and  Afghanistan, and  theultimate  emergence  out  of the  disorder of a series of Moslem States between  the caspian and Chinese Turkestan into  whose orbit  Afghanistan might be drawn, andwhich might   become  dangerous  fields   for the  propagation  of  Panturanian   orPanislamic ideas.  In the former case Bolshevism  is the enemy, in tho latter it is -rather the friend.  In neither case  can  we do very nmeb to achieve our purpose by force  of arms.   The seat of  disorder is Tashkent, winch  is beyond bnr reach, even ifwe could maintain a division east of the  Caspian.  At present we are only touchingthe fringe of  the Bolshevik problem  by supporting the  Asldiabacl Government; andthe only effective things  we are doing  are-(a) keeping Bolshevism out  of  Persia,and possibly Afghanistan ; (6) cutting the Bolsheviks off from  access to and supplies from  European Russia by the Trans-Caspian Railway.  This latter is really important,because  so long as  the Cossacks hold Orenburg,  the Tashkent Bolsheviks  are  thuscompletely isolated ; they cannot link up with the  movement elsewhere, and we might in  time  even  starve them  out.  Whether there, is any great risk of  Bolshevismspreading  to  Afghanistan seems to me doubtful-it lias not apparently made muchheadway among the Moslems in  Russian territory, where it seems rather to stand  for russian racial tyranny.   Persia might be more likely ground for it.     -  -     As regards the possible  formation of  Moslem States  in Central Asia, 1  doubt ifwe could do anything to prevent a serious movement in  that direction.  Even if  wehad troops available to deal with a general Moslem  rising against Bolshevik tyrannyin  which all  Russians  were  involved we could  not afford to  be  fighting  againstMoslems.  So far there does  not seem to be  any  sign of such a movement, though itis possible that if the Turkomans attacked and  overthrew the Askhabad MenshevikGovernment, the conflagration might spread.      Other factors to be taken into account are (1) the difficulty of  maintaining largebodies of troops east of the Caspian ; (2) the fact  that public opinion would probably not tolerate  peace  terms  which, involved  our having to  do  so; (3) that we cannotmaintain any troops there without crossing foreign territory, either Persian or Russian ; (4) that holding the Batum-Baku railway means holding the country through whichit runs, which is a  considerable military operation, and, if it were  prolonged, wouldalienate the best Russian feeling which we wish to conciliate.      These are the main factors in the situation so far as I can see  it from an Indianpoint of view.      I now come to the practical decision as to the  action to be taken.  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff argues that with a.&quot; friendly Turkey &quot; to form an effective barrier across the  fine of  advance, the  danger to the countries bordering on India disappears.   But are we certain that wo shall have a &quot; friendly Turkey &quot; to deal with ? A new Government has just been set up which  is certainly more promising than its predecessor, but we have reason to believe that certain elements in Turkey anything , but friendly to us, Including  Euver Pasha, are endeavouring to establish themselves in a  new Azerbaijan Republic which would include apparently part  of Trans-Caucasia as well as of the Persian province of Azerbaijan,  and they thus hope, no doubt, to be able  to carry  on operations against our position in India in spite of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and its  Allies.   But even if the  Turks aro eliminated, the Bolsheviks remain.    If  in present  conditions  we withdraw from Trans-Gasp fa, the  Askhabad Government-a poor thing at  best would  inevitably disappear,  and we  may  have Bolshevism rampant all  along the north frontiers of Persia with little or nothing to prevent its spread southwards.

    These  considerations lead  me  to  think  that we  should  be unwise to relax ourhold on the Caspian and the country east  ol&apos;  it until the general situation is  clearer.in particular 1 should hope that we would not withdraw until our communication withthe Caspian via Batoum and Baku is firmly established, and  that the  Mission  under General Malleson will be  maintained if  possible, until  some measure  oi stability hasbeen restored in Trans-Caspia,    in paragraph 11 of his Note, the Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos; comes to theconclusion  that  wo should aim at withdrawing  our  troops  from  European Russiabefore Peace has been signed  and the establishment of  a firm  Russian  Government in siberia.  Now the signature oi&apos; Peace may precede the establishment of the firm RussianGovernment to  which  lie refers,  and  1  recognise  that  the  general  situation  maycompel us  to  agree to evacuating Trans-Caspia when Peace is signed, in that casewo should, 1  think, have to  pursue a policy which, from an Indian  point of view,would be but a second  best.  We should  have to remain where we are as  long as wecan, supporting the Malleson Mission, anil we should have to encourage anti-Bolshevikmovements with a view to encouraging the Siberian Government and  to helping it to clear up the Trans-Caspian and Turkestan situation itself, with the aid of the localmovements to  which we should have given our support.   But the local &quot; friendlies&quot;would have to  understand clearly that at the signature  of Peace, we were going towithdraw, and it would be for them to  make themselves strong enough to stand aloneby that date.
