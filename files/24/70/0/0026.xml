One of the immediate effects of the conclusion of hostilities is an impatience of that control which has been in force during the war period and a tendency to consider it nolonger necessary in the national interest, and to regard it, if continued, simply as a normalfeature of bureaucracy and therefore to be progressively resented. An outstanding instanceof J^his is the agitation for the repeal of the Defence of the Realm Act, an agitation whichis prominent in the &quot; Herald &quot; among Labour papers, and in a manifesto which has beenissued by a number of Labour candidates for  Parliament on the subject of that law andthe election.   The manifesto is signed by sixteen of these candidates including Miss MaryMacarthur, Messrs.  Anderson, Jowett, Ramsay Macdonald,  and Robert Williams.  Inthe manifesto they state that they do not propose to consider the existence of the D.O.R.A.or to pay it any respect in so far as it  conflicts  with their intention to discuss all the issues of the election and to use such information about them as they possess.   A second im-mediate result has been a  most natural and indeed inevitable relaxation of effort amongthe  workers, which is perhaps  not  generally to be regretted, but which may in certaindirections, as for instance in the case of coal mines, have serious results for the country.     In connection with the coal mines it is desirable to remember that at  the Conferenceof the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, which was held at Southport in July last, certainresolutions were passed on  which action was promised within four weeks of the declarationof peace.  The more important resolutions may be summarised as demanding a five-day week, a six-hour day, and payment as for a normal working week of six days at the existing     (C 1528)                                                                 A
rate of wages.  It is true that at the special conference of the Miners&apos; Federation whichwas held on 7th November no reference was made to these resolutions.   They are, however,on record, and it is legitimate to anticipate that an  agitation based upon them  may  be initiated at any time,  now that a  treaty  of  peace is  insight and something whichresembles it very closely has already been signed.     A further circumstance of some importance is the agitation which is in progress forthe release  of Conscientious Objectors, of what are termed, by the Labour press, &quot; political prisoners,&quot; and particularly for  that of John Maclean.  Agitation for the release of thelast named is of considerable proportions and is important on  the Clyde.  Many meetingshave been held in Glasgow in. support of the demand, some of them attaining very largeproportions.   At certain of them, exceedingly revolutionary speeches have been delivered,notably by Arthur McManus, and there can be no doubt that the Clyde Defence PropagandaCommittee has in John Macleans imprisonment a most useful plank in its platform.   Inother parts of the country the  agitation  is less pronounced  and practically  only existsas the result of visits of Gallacher and McManus to certain industrial centres.   From this fact it would  not, however, be safe to conclude that the interest is artificial, for at thegreat meeting held at the Albert Hall on Sunday, 3rd November, allusion to John Maclean&apos;simprisonment  was  made in strong terms of disapprobation by practically all the chiefspeakers, and  the sympathy  of  the audience with their remarks was  very obvious.  Tothis agitation  the Labour press has lent itself with a will, describing John Maclean as in poor health on account \of the  tortures which he has suffered during his hunger strike.The description is doubtless exaggerated as  is indicated by the official statement on thesubject  which has been made  in the  daily  press.   It served its  purpose, however, insupport of allegations of ill-treatment of a protagonist of the proletariat by the representa-tives of an  unsympathetic Government.  In view of the fact that John Maclean has beenadopted  by the Labour Party as candidate in opposition to Mr. Barnes, his continuedimprisonment  during the election will probably add force to the demand for his release.    In normal times the circumstances detailed above need probably cause little anxiety.Under existing conditions, however, they command more importance.  The spread of thebacillus of  Bolshevism in central Europe is  watched with sympathetic interest by  the extremist section of Labour.  Nothing would please that section more than any restriction of liberty which would be likely  to create an atmosphere favourable to the further spread of the bacillus to this country.  It is desirable and should be possible to maintain  thatessential national unity without which effective reconstruction will be impossible.   this result will  most probably be obtained if  restrictions on  personal liberty  of speech and action  are  reduced to  a  minimum, and  such  restrictions as  are  inevitable tactfullyadministered.II. PRESS COMMENTS.                                   (A.)- Military.     There is a lull in the discussion of Peace terms in the current issues of the Labourpapers, and most of them are reduced to expressing disapproval  of the continuance ofhostilities.  The  &quot; Bradford  Pioneer &quot;  describes the end of the Italian campaign as a criminal and heartless allied offensive, while Mr. Brailsford in the &quot;Herald &quot; drives home the same lesson by showing how democratic Germany has become.Lord Northcliffe&apos;s Peace Memorandum,.     The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; which may be taken as a typical representative of the Labourpress on this matter, regards the memorandum as an official pronouncement, unexpectedlytemperate both in substance and tone.  It is complained, however, that such extraordinaryprivileges should be accorded to a particular newspaper proprietor, and not extended toall, and it is considered intolerable that the expenses of distribution should be borne bythe Government.  The  &quot; Herald &quot; also  joins issues on three points :  (1) The  treatmentof Russia ; (2) the Freedom of the Seas  ; (3) the absence of any reference to Ireland.                                (B.) Foreign Affairs.  The Spread of Revolution.-!^ spread of Bolshevism outside Russia is generally welcomed.The &quot;  workers Dreadnought&quot;  confesses to &quot; watching with impatience and  sympathythe swift  moving struggle.&quot;  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is afraid lest the peace strategy of
the Allies should be devoted to stemming the tide of social revolt, and demands an imme-diate calling together  of  the Internationale.  The &quot; Herald &quot; expresses  the  hope thatthe Revolution will become quite general, and a writer in the same paper, discussing the impossibility of fixing the racial frontiers in Poland, Bohemia and Transylvania, considersthat the &quot; only road to peace is the  breaking of the politicians and their nationalism bya social revolution which will sweep aside and render obsolete the issues which have been created to divide tho nationalities.&quot;Intervention in Russia.     Strenuous demands for the  withdrawal of  Allied troops from Russia continue to appear.  The &quot; Herald,&quot;  the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; consider  that  inter-vention has for  its object the. overthrow of the Soviet  Governments.  The &quot; Herald &quot;claims that the war is continued in the interests of capitalists, who desire the continuanceof D.O.R.A. and conscription at home, and see an opportunity for profiteering in Russia.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; anticipates the taking of similar  action in Bulgaria, Austria andGermany.Labour at the Peace Conference.     While other labour papers continue to criticise the absence  of labour representation at the preliminary negotiations, the  &quot; Call&quot; definitely calls upon Labour to put a stopto these demands,  which will only shackle Labour in its dealings with democracies abroad.                              (C.) Home  Affairs.The  General Election.     All the papers are agreed that the Election is to be engineered in such a way as tosecure a personal triumph for Mr. Lloyd George.  This is the view even of the pro-war&quot; Justice.&quot;  The &quot; Herald &quot; thinks that he is anxious for a new lease of power while thesoldiers are still muzzled, and unable to vote, while the censor gags the press and D.O.R.A.threatens the platform.  The &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; gives  currency to a rumour that it isthe intention of the Government to issue a joint memorandum signed by Mr. Lloyd George,Mr.  Bonar Law,  and Mr. Geo. Barnes  appealing to the nation to  support a coalition government during the period of reconstruction.  To this the &quot; Herald &quot; thinks labour should not agree.  It is time to be done with Coalitions.  The &quot; Herald,&quot; also publishesan article by Mr. Henderson, in which  he  claims that the coalition  has no policy, andthat the Labour Party is the only one with principles.  It is the  people&apos;s  party with acreative policy.     In connection with the prospective election, the &quot; Herald &quot; demands that the soldiersshould be allowed to take part in. propaganda for elections and to tell the truth on thesubject of the inhuman punishments inflicted in the army,  the inadequacy of soldiers&apos;pay, etc.D.O.R.A. and the Election.     The &quot; Herald &quot; gives prominence to a declaration by a number of candidates, including mr..  W.  C. Anderson, Mr.  Cramp,  Mr. Jowett, Mr. Kirkwood, Miss Mary Macarthur,Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mr. Robert Williams to the effect that they intend to disregardD.O.R.A. during the coming election.  The same paper prints an article entitled &quot; HangD.O.R.A.&quot; by Mr. Langdon Davis.  He considers that D.O.R.A. will  win the electionfor Mr. Lloyd George, unless it is killed by Labour now.John Maclean.     The agitation to release John Maclean still continues.  The &quot; Call &quot;  asks workingmen and working women whether they will allow him to be slowly done to death in acapitalist prison, which is the symbol of the capitalists&apos; cruelty and violence.(0 1528)
-J                               III.-DISTRICT REPORTS. London and South Eastern.     Sonic unrest is reported among the aircraft workers at Hammersmith and Cheltenham over questions of wages.  Otherwise conditions appear to be quiet in this district. Yorkshire and East Midlands.     No disturbances are reported in this area.     In the  Nottingham district there is  some dissatisfaction among  the  agricultural labourers  because German prisoners are being  employed at A\ages considerably below the authorised district rate. North Western.     A certain amount of unrest is manifest in this area, and several strikes are in progress.     It  appears that Stavenhagen is  largely responsible  for the strike  which occurred at  the  Lilac Mill  (Shaw) on November 7th.  For  some time he has been agitating for the recognition of a Joint Workers&apos; Committee representing  all the  employees at  the Lilac and Gorse Mills.     Serious discontent is reported among the dock gatemen and other riverside workers employed at Mersey Dock because they have not been included  in the recent award given by the Committee on Production to the dockers.  It is argued that their labour is regular, and therefore in a different category from dockers&apos; labour, which is casual. Northern.     No unrest is reported from this area.     A general stoppage of work is said to  be likely to take place on the signing of  thearmistice, and this is expected to last for at least a week. Wales.    With the exception of a strike in the Blaina district, no unrest is  evident in this area.    A considerable number of collieries were idle on November 8th owing to a false peaceTumour.    A Bolshevik pamphlet, purporting to have been signed by Lenin, is now being cir-culated  secretly in the Rhondda Valley.  It is believed that attempts are being madeto circulate this pamphlet among soldiers.   The pamphlet states that  the Allied armieshave occupied the Murman coast in the interests of capitalists and in order to overthrowthe Russian Revolution.Scotland.    No  unrest exists in this district.    The British Socialist Party held a meeting at Glasgow on November  6th, whereGallacher is reported to have made a speech of a very revolutionary character.                                   IV.- DISPUTES.    In spite of the fact that there are three strikes in. progress involving a considerablenumber of men, the situation generally is satisfactory.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.    Only five fresh stoppages are reported  by the  Admiralty Labour Department,  andin three cases work has already been resumed.           The only strike of importance  is that  the shipwrights and drillers employed by Harland       &amp; Wolff at Bootle who, to the number of 200, ceased work on November 6th, owing to a demar-       cation dispute with the engineers.    The Ministry of Munitions reports that only 118 workers were on strike on November6th, as compared to 4,653  at the end of the  previous week.           Four strikes are still unsettled,  but it appears that none of them has material importance.
     The Goal Controller reports 12 fresh stoppages for the week ending 12th November ;these included, however, a number of stoppages in S. Wales on November 8th in consequenceof the rumoured signature of the Armistice.            The whole of the pits belonging to the Lancaster Steam Coal Company (South Wales)        are idle because the management refuse to grant the men&apos;s  demand that they shall be allowed        to go up the pit at any time during the working shift.  Some neighbouring collieries are out        in sympathy.     No report has  been received  from the War Office Contracts  Department.  -Reported from Other Sources.            A&quot; strike is reported as having occurred at Lilac Mill (Shaw) on November 7th, when all        the employees (about 500), ceased work because the manager and a few men had stayed over        night to pull down  some  unnecessary partitions.  An allegation is made that he employed        production staff, instead of construction staff, in doing so, and his  dismissal is demanded.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.     The Admiralty Labour Department reports no cases of importance.     The Ministry of Munitions reports one case of cessation of  overtime.     The Coal Controller reports two cases.            The Government offer to establish an  81  hours&apos; day for surface workers six months after        the signing of peace, has been rejected both by the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and by        the Surface Workers&apos; Council.            The Craftsmen&apos;s Association in South Wales has also decided to reject the Government^        offer, and to hand in notices in support of their demand for an 8-hour day.     The Committee on Production heard 38 cases in London and 12 in  Glasgow last week.            These included  (1)  an application by  the National Association of  Unions in  the Textile        Trade for an increase in war wages; (2) an application by the Electrical Trades Union for an        advance of 15s. a week.     The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports  155  new differences for the week endingNovember 9th.                                                                   G. H. ROBERTS.
