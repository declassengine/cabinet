(I).Reference JVt,27 th November, 1918.Sir,          I beg  to  submit the following Report on  the work  of  theFood Production  Department for the week ended 26th November:-                 The leather and Oondition of Crops.          The weather experienced throughout the country  during thepast week has been  generally most favourable for the  carrying  on of all agricultural operations.   Frosts at night  have  been general, but have not,  except in a few districts,  caused  more serious inconvenience than the suspension&apos;of potato  lifting androot pulling,, for a few hours.          In some districts, the whole of the  potato and  rootcrops have now  been harvested*          Autumn cultivation is proceeding apace,  and a large  area has been sown with  wheat,f          Early  sown  corn which Is now up looks exceedingly well.  jHAll available  threshing tackle has been extremely  busy during the  fe&apos;past week,                      LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Determination  of Tenancy * Cases settled by Arbitration.    InSeptember,  1918,  the  Department authorised the  BedfordshireExecutive Committee to determine the tenancy  of a  farm atPavenham which,  in their opinion, was being so  neglected  thatthere was no prospect of its making an adequate contribution tothe food supply  of the country unless a change  of  occupier were.effected.   The  farmer exercised his right of appeal under theCorn Production  (Amendment) Act, 1918, and the  case was accordingly referred to an arbitrator appointed by the President &apos;
 of  the  surveyors  Institution,    The case  has  now been heard and the arbitrator has determined that the occupier had not cultivated? the farm in accordance with the rules of good  husbandry and that H his tenancy should be determined.           A farmer in Warwickshire whose tenancy was determined by the Board required a reference  to arbitration  under the Corn Production (Amendment) Act,  1918,   The arbitrator has now Issued his award that the land ha3 not been cultivated according to the  I rules  of good husbandry.    The  notice to determine the tenancy tool. effect,  therefore, at the expiration of 14 days from the date of tl delivery of the award.   Under  the award the parties are to bear their  own costs of the arbitration and pay the arbitrator&apos;s costs amounting to  5.5,0 in equal proportions. Determination of Tenancies,t   During the week  one Order has been made by the Board determining a tenancy on account of bad farming o a holding of 20 acres. Prosecutions.   A farmer at Effingham in Surrey has been fined  25,and  5,5,0 costs for failure to comply with a  cultivation order served upon him by the Executive Committee,   A farmer at Rothwell in Northamptonshire has been fined  10,10,0 for a similar offence. Destruction of Rooks,   In the  spring of last  year the Northumberla Agricultural Executive Committee authorised the killing of rooks at Vioodhill Rookery.   The owner of the rookery sued the persons so authorised and also the Secretary of the Committee for damages for trespass and the matter was tried at Newcastle-on-Tyne Assizes. The Judge held that the Committee had authority to. make the order for killing or diminishing the number of rooks and that there was justification for the issue of the order in this particular case; he accordingly gave judgment for the defendants with costs.                        Land Drainage.           The following is a brief summary of the principal work carried out by ,the nest Riding Agricultural Executive  Committee,- v,&apos;est Moor and Parks Drains Scheme;   Area improved, 3,327 acres,&apos; area reclaimed, 700 acres;  estimated cost  1,366.

The river has never been cleaned before,  and the improve-ment is considerable.          The Committee and their Chief Executive Officer also undertook with great promptitude the  repair of the  disastrous breaches in the banks of the Ouse and the Aire which occurred in September, 1918.                         HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Allotments.   Reports received from 1,193 districts show that 296,196 plots containing 21,407 acres have been provided under the Cultivation of Lands (Allotments) Order, 1918, and&apos; previous Orders.          During the week, in addition to the above mentioned area, 39 local authorities have agreed to aquire 486 acres (5,793 allotments), including 100 acres at Whitword.          In Hucknall Torkard (Notts.) 2,300 of  the 3,200 house-holders have allotments and 700 others are cultivating gardens attached to their houses.
          Demonstrations in percolation and arterial drainage,trenching and general soil working have been carried out on lowlying allotment areas in the Beckenham district.          An address on allotment cultivation and management hasbeen given to the United Allotment Holders1 Society at Ilford, EssMany interesting points In connection with oropping were raised, aadvice was given on the importance of the selection of potatoes frreliable sources for seed purposes, preference being given to immujkinds.Acetic Acid.   The Ministry of Munitions have released a furthersupply of 80$ aoetic acid for the purpose of food preservationand the Ministry of Food have been asked to make available *further quantity of vinegar for the same purpose.Bees.   At the recent Council Meeting of the British Beekeepers1Association, the Departments proposed  schemes  in connection withapiculture were explained.    The Council stated that the Departirwould receive the full  support of the British Beekeepers&apos; Associatand its affiliated Associations.         - A lecture on  beekeeping was given at  Ventnor on the 18thNovember at which the audience numbered 136.Marketing.   A meeting  of  the Dorset Fruit arid  Vegetable Societywas held during  the week,  and  the work  of the Auction Marts atBournemouth and  Bosoombe was investigated.   The Society intends &apos;open  a  further market at Poole in the  Immediate future.                        TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection  of Land.   (1)   An Inspection was made of AppletonCommon, Kirbymoorside,  about 200 acres  of  which were  takenpossession  of by the  North Riding Agricultural  Executive  Committalin March,  1918.   About 76 acres have  already been  enclosed andcropped with  oats  and potatoes.   Wien taken  over  the land  was                                                                 Irough,  bare common and, in view  of  the  fact  that operations werenot commenced  until the end of March,  the  production of quitesatisftctory crops  this year reflects  the  greatest  credit  on  themanagement.
     (2)  A visit was paid to a farm-of 260 acres in Buckinghamshirewhich has been used chiefly for sporting purposes.   The farmwas acquired by the present occupier last Michaelmas and is ina very impoverished condition.   About 25 acres of the arable land Is derelict, and 45 acres of useful, well-sheltered grasshad been allowed tls become extremely rough and bush-grown.   Inaddition, about 40 acres of down-land, some of it potentiallyvaluable grazing ground, has been totally neglected.   Advicewas given as to the cultivation and stocking of the farm, which under skilful management should speedily become a most desirable and productive holding.                         LABOUR DIVISION,Demob 3,1 is at ion.  The Department have now arranged with theDepartment of Demobilisation and Resettlement for the release of10,000 &quot;pivotal&quot; men for agriculture in advance of generaldemobilisation.   A quota has been allotted to each county, and instructions issued as regards the selection of these men, whose.early release will facilitate the re-starting of trades ofnational importance and assist in increasing the volume ofemployment available for the men who will be returned on generaldemobilisation.          It has also been arranged that, in connection withgeneral demobilisation, the Agricultural Executive Committeesshall work in conjunction with the Local Employment ExchangesIn obtaining from employers particulars, of their formerenployees whom they are willing to employ, in order that such men may be ear-marked for early release when the time arrives.Harvest Labour.  2,831 soldiers still remain out on harvest work from the various distribution centres.   6,04^ prisoners are nowout on farms under the migratory gang system, the majority ofthese being engaged on potato picking.
          All demands for harvest labour have been met and theexisting supply of labour will be sufficient to secure theremainder of the potato crop.Ploughmen for Autumn Cultivations.  The number of ploughmenspecially released on two months1 agricultural furlough &quot;forautumn cultivation work and now out on forms Is 2,202.   In vieJof the further order that all skilled ploughmen serving at homeare to be released on agricultural furlough, the numbers may beexpected to Increase considerably during the coming week.                      Women&apos;s Branch.          Reports are continually being received of the excellework which Is being done by women engaged on practically everyagricultural operation.   Evidence shows - that farmers in generaare anxious that it; shall be realised that the need for women othe land^has not now ceased.   A considerable number of theLand Army women undoubtedly wish to continue their agricultural work after the war, either in this country or the OverseasDominions. -          The/Welfare Officers recently appointed have fullyproved-their value during the present influenza epidemic   Owlto the closing down of many of the potato camps, the welfare officers in London have been engagedtin meeting women and arranging for their-transport across London, and assisting inthe despatch of others to the seaside for. convalescence afterInfluenza.Women-&apos;s Institutes.  The Ministry of Pood has offered to equip and maintain three National Kitchens in villages whereWomen&apos;s Institutes exist, in order to show how such kitchenscan be made profitable.   The villages where they,are to&quot; beset up will be selected by the Ministry, after local enquires as to suitability and prospect of success have been made&apos;.          18 Women.&apos;s Institutes have been started during the wetwo of which, at Truro and Penzance, are Institute Centres,    &apos;whose object it is to help surrounding Institutes.
                    CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor Scheme *   The following figures show the position with regardto the provision of tractors,  machinery and implements owned  by theDepartment for the week ended  23rd November, 1918s-                                         No, consigned  Total No.                                         during week.    with  counties,                Tractors ...............      -            4,209                                         (5 withdrawn)                Ploughs ...............f      -            5,401                                         (31 withdrawn)          During the week ended 8th November 14,414 acres were ploughed, 80 acres were cross  ploughed and 1,044 acres cultivated.Horse Scheme.  Information has been received from most counties tothe effect that a large number of horses are likely to be standingidle for the next two or three months, in spite of the reduction inthe weekly hiring charges.  This condition is largely due to  thefact that farmers have finished the work, and in some cases,especially in Hertfordshire, it may be due to the fact that theyhave information that a large number of Army horses may be soldduring the next few months.Steam Tackle.  The acreage dealt with during the past week is asfollowsj- ploughed 9,820 acresj cultivated 3,84^ acres, harrowed1,203 acres, mole drained 31 acres, rolled 50 acres.  Total 14,951&quot;acres.                         SUPPLIES DIVISION.Binder Twine.  For some time past the question of tho price ofbinder Wine has been under discussion with the makers.  In view ofthe possible variations in the price of hemp it has been decided toleave the price for the 1919 harvest uncontrolled on the under-standing that the British makers will produce  not less than 12,000tons for sale in this country.   The competition between-variousmakers will  no doubt be sufficient to keep  prices at  a moderatelevel, in addition to which facilities will be given  for tho
importation of twine from America.  The Department has also acertain quantity of twine in its own hands which will be sold ata moderate price.  On the understanding that the makers manufacturesufficient to meet&apos; the home requirements, it is proposed to grantexport licences where possible in order to assist makers to recoveithe valuable export trade which existed before the war.   This  -vii&apos; jhave the advantage of enabling makers to sell twine made from high/&apos;priced hemp, and to replace it for sale on the home market withhemp bought at lower figures.Demobilisation of Expert Seedsmen.  As a result of a circular leU&apos;issued to seedsmen last week applications have been received forthe early release from H.M.Forces of a largo number of seed expertand pivotal men in the seed trade.   These applications indicatehow seriously the expert staffs.of seed firms have been depletedand the urgent need for early release being effected to enable that carry on their trade during the forthcoming season.Testing of Seeds Order.  By arrangement with Agricultural ExecuteCommittees a large number of posters drawing the attention of faitirsto the requirements of the Testing of Seeds Order are now displayiiyon market and post office notice boards.  A special distribution!)farmers of the leaflets dealing with the Testing of Seeds Order hsalso been effected recently through Executive Committees.        rSeed Oats,  Preliminary arrangements have now ,been made for securingfrom Ireland a reserve of Black Tartarian Oats for seed purpose the Department will make arrangements for recleaning the oats whefthey arrive at English ports, and it is proposed, that distributionshould be effected through selected distributing agents who willprepared to supply local merchants or farmers direct.,Wart Disease.  Stops are being taken to organise courses of lectui^3on wart disease, and the attention of growers will be directed the importance of selecting fseedf for planting.                 /          A revised list of varieties approved by the Department *s[immune from wart disease is now being prepared for issue.  It is a^J
i 312hoped that arrangements may be made for conducting trials of immunevarieties in 1919 on farms in infected areas, .vith a view todemonstrating the suitability of certain of the newer immunevarieties for cultivation under farm conditions.been examined this week in Hertfordshire and in the Bristol area,and in no case was any abnormal wastage observed.          In Hertfordshire large clamps of &quot;King Edward&quot; shewedabout 6 per cent of diseased tubers.  &quot;Arran Chief&quot; was affected toan extent of about 4 per cent.   In the Bristol area clamps of &quot;KingEdward&quot; showed only 2 per cent of disease, and in &quot;Scottish Farmer&quot;no disease was found.          These results, as far as they go, indicate that, notwith-standing certain reports of heavy wastage in the clamps, it would be easy to over-estimate the amount of loss due to disease.  It mu3t beremembered that varieties differ greatly in this respect.  &quot;BritishQueen&quot; and &quot;Up-to-Date&quot; concerning which some adverse reports haverecently been made, are particularly susceptible to damage.          Potato lifting has not yet been completed in the West ofEngland and in Hertfordshire, but, considering the lateness of the season, the amount of disease seen In the crops as lifted is notgreat.  Field crops of &quot;Arran Chief&quot; were being lifted with lessthan 5 per cent of diseased tubers;   &quot;King Edward&quot; with about 2 percent, and &quot;Up-to-Date&quot; (a very susceptible variety) with 20 per cent.Inspection of Potatoes in Clamps.   A number of potato clamps  have i am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General..The Rt. Hon. Rowland S.
