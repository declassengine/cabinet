The allotment of space to Munitions for the UnitedKingdom which stood at 200,000 tons for November was consequentlyreduced and only a certain amount of metals and other materialnecessary for Industrial use will be shipped.

The shipment of remounts from the  United States and canada has been cancelled, and this will set free a considerableamount of space for the shipment of foodstuffs, etc., to thiscountry.
