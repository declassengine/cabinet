At this stage I wish to statebriefly what steps I have so far taken and what progress has beenmade ,      In the  first  place  our Delegates at the  ieaoe  Conference will want  not only a Brief but  a number of exports v,hoia  they may be able to  consult  on all  the numerous subjects which will  come up for ccuvr--.e ration.   These officials have to be nominated in advance a-:, a instructed to  got all  the  information necessary to qualify thorn  as export advisers  to our Delegation,      In the  second place,  our  Peace  Brief includes  two sets of documents:  general statements  of our case which  will summarise all that  it is  important  for our Delegates to know when they come,to present our case generally at  the Conference,  and -the icore detailed and technical memoranda  which  will be used at the Committees and Sab-Committees to  which  I  assume a great deal of tho work of the Conference  will be relegated.      For the preparation of our General Brief I  have appointed Sir Erie Richards,  who with a  small  staff is  proceeding with the work as  expeditiously  as the departments  keep him supplied with  materlaid   He has  already finished writing the section on the German  Colonies, and  is  now busy with the section on  Turkey and  th Middle  East  as well as several others.  ..&apos;  &apos;With regard to the  more detailed and&apos; technical parts of the1 Brief.and the nomination of experts  who will  supervise their pre- paration, the following  steps  have been.taken.JJLffiS^gl^I^P-PRPyEHPY Off HIS BRITANUIO MAJESTYrS SOVERMNjn) . of   T.

Copy  of letter from General, Smuts to tho  Prime Minister,
         The territorial questions with which the ForeignOffice deals have been divided into six groups, in respectof each of which it has appointed an expert official who ha3a staff under him to assist him in writing the necessarystatements and getting the necessary material in order.The nomination of those officials has naturally &quot;been leftto the Foreign Office, who must remain responsible forthe details of this work.   Much of this territorial work has been already done, and it is hoped that about the middleof December most of t;ie work will be complete.         All the Trade, Economic, Tariff, and Shippingquestions have been formed into another group for which theBoard of Trade has beon made responsible.   In consultationwith the other Departments they have prepared this sectionof the Brief and written the necessary memoranda.   Thissection of the work is practically complete.         At the Treasury I have, with the approval ofthe Chancellor, appointed Mr. Keynes at the head of anothergroup to deal with all the financial questions.   He is work-ing hard with an export staff at this most important and difficult work, and has instructions to be ready by themiddle of December.   His principal problem is that ofIndemnity and Reparation, but naturally many other important questions have also to be dealt with.         The War Staffs  (Naval, Military, Air) are working at the preparation of their special presentations ofour oase.   Both the Admiralty and the Foreign Office are dealing with the Freedom of  the Seas.         Sir Erie Richards is also working at theleague of Nations and a nuiber of legal  questions which will arise at the Conference,   Seme of the above groups are work-ing at particular aspects of tho League  of Nations.   these groups are all working with  proper liaison and consultation between them under my general supervision.         I am pushing the work as fast as possible, but as you will 3ee the whole will  not be finished before the middleof December.         I have been  discussing with the  Chancellor youridea  of the personnel  of our Delegation  to the Conference.
Although I m:: deeply interested in the work and shall gladlybe willing to carry it to completion, still it deserves con-si deration whether one of your colleagues who will he perman-ently associated with you at the Conference should not takeover the work from me or at least be associated with thepreparation of the Brief,    The work is most difficult and important and you must have a colleague with you at theConference whom you can hold responsible for its adequatepreparation as a whole,&apos;                          Yours sincerely,                            (Sd.)  J.G,Smuts..The &quot;Rt.Eon.D.Iloya George,  M.P.,          10,  Downing Street,                 8 &apos;&quot; i
