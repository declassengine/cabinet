(lSI3, M^MSJ^^.^9JggJLgi HIS  BaiMNIC  MAJ!SSTYrS  GOVERNMENT) h   SECRET,        &quot;**&quot;              W A R___0,A B I  B E T*     *   N             3D E M 0 B I L  I  S A T I 0  No                         Note &quot;by tho Sec-rotary,      It  is  submitted  for the  consideration  of the  War  Cabinet that  it  is  a matter of the  first  importance  that  the  oxporienoe of  the present War should be  available  in a  practical  form  for any future  war in which, at however  distant  a date,  this country may have  the misfortune to  become  involved.      Under  tho authority of the late  Government,  a letter,  of which I attach  G  copy, was  circulated from this Cffj.ce  to all Departments-and Committees.   Since the advent of the present  Government, however,  a  number of  now Departments  and Committees have  come into  existence,  which have  not received the  letter.      I now  ask for the  authority  of  the War  Cabinet to circulate the same  letter  to all  Departments,  whether  they have  received it  previously  or not, so that before any departmental demobilisa- tion  is  completed, the  necessary  information may be forthcoming,                                 (Signed)    M.P*A,HAMEI0Z Whitehall Gardens, 3,a&quot;.   21st November,  1918.
 [This Document is the Property of His Britamric Maj*esty;s Government.]SECRET.  K-60.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE,            2, WHITEHALL GARDENS,                            LONDON, S.W.Sir,                                                              July 25,1916.     I  AM directed by the Prime Minister to inform you that at a recent meeting ofthe Reconstruction Committee the question was raised of the desirability of collectingthe experience  of the various Departments and Committees concerned in the conductof the present war, with a view to the eventual preparation of a new War Book on itstermination.   The  recommendation  of  the  Reconstruction  Committee was that thequestion should be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence.     2. The Prime Minister considers that  at the present stage of the war all that can usefully be done by the Committee of Imperial Defence in this connection is to ensurethat a fall record shall be available at the  end  of the war whenever that may be ofthe practical working of all war  administrative machinery, and lie has directed me to request all Departments  to  take such interim action as they may think fit with thisobject in vieAV.     3. The Prime Minister  suggests that particular attention  should  be devoted tothose organisations, whether Departments, sections  of  Departments,  or Committees,which have either been created or expanded from a small, nucleus for the purposes ofthe war.   He regards it as of special importance that a very careful record should bemade of their work and system of operation, in order that, at the  end of the war, inconnection with the  compilation of a  future  War Book, full  information may  beavailable on the following points :      (a.) How the Department, Section, or  Committee came into being, and by whose           authority ; also a brief description of its scope and activities.     (b.) The best  arrangements for  mobilising or re-establishing the organisation on           the  outbreak or in immediate anticipation of  war.     (c.) The authority on whom  should rest the responsibility for action as  iu (b); in           this  connection  the  incidence of  departmental  responsibility should  be           carefully passed under review.     (d.) The extent of the nucleus (if any) which it is desirable should be maintained           in time of peace.     (e.) The  preparation and maintenance  of panels from which  can be drawn the           personnel of the organisation when re-established for war.     (/.) The  desirability of retaining on  the Statute  Book  or keeping ready to be&apos;           re-enacted on the  outbreak of any future war Acts of Parliament passed           for the purposes of the war.  Also  the suitability,  for issue at the outset of           future wars, of Proclamations and Orders in Council in operation  at the           close of the present war.     (g.) Instructions  for  the  guidance  of  all  concerned  in  the  event of   the           re-establishment  of  the  organisation.   The  information  on this  head           might include all details of the working of the organisation ; forms which           might usefully  be kept ready;  instructions to officers of other Departments           or  Committees  concerned  in  carrying  out work on behalf of,  or in           connection with, the organisation ;  particulars of the relations with such           Departments or Committees, and  lists of persons to whom experience has           shown that reports ought to be  communicated.    Ck.) Imperfections of  constitution  and working which experience has revealed,           together with suggestions as to  remedies;   any other information  which           experience has shown ayouIc! be  conducive  to the rapid re-establishment           and  smooth Avorking of the organisation on a Avar footing.
    4. I am to add that no reports are asked for at  the  present  moment  (unless any department wishes to draw  the  attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence  tosome  question of  immediate  importance in  this  connection),  but  rather that theattention of all persons  responsible, or who can assist in this matter, may be called tothe fact that, on the termination  of  the war, full reports as to their war activities maybe called for, in order that  they  may have this in  mind  and make a  record of anyexperiences likely to be useful in their preparation.    5. The Prime Minister  also suggests that  Departments  should consider what usecan be made of war organisations during an armistice or period of demobilisation.    6.                        copies of  this letter are enclosed for communication,if thought fit, toFurther copies can be  supplied  if required for the use of any other Committees  orBodies for which your Department is responsible.             ;     7. Copies of this letter have been, addressed to the. Departments mentioned in theaccompanying list.                                   I am,                                       Sir,                             Your obedient Servant,Secretary.PBINTJSD AT IliE FOREIGN OFFICE BY 0. R. HARRISON.-24/7/1916.it
