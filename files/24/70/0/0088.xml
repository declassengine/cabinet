\* \       (This D(           His tin.;;.joint CR&amp;T ...&quot;                     all CABINET              ANTICIPATED STRIii Of THE ELECTRICAL                       TRADES UNION,memorandum of minister of labour,     On the 24th October,  I submitted to the war   Cabinet amemorandum (G.T.3085)  on the subject of an,anticipated strike ofthe electrical Trades  Union in Electrical Power Undertakings, andthe Cabinet decided that I should convene a Committee to remain in session during the strike, in the event of such a strike occurring,for the purposes of co-ordinating the activities of the various departments in order to carry out the proposals put forward in myiemorandumj and generally to deal with the strike.    A preliminary meeting of the Committee was held on Gth November. fter discussion it was decided that the enquiry then being made as o the number of men required to keep the Electrical Power undertaking - ngs running, should be completed as soon as possible and that returns hould be obtained&apos; from the ,-var Office) Admiralty and Air ministry, f electricians available in the respective services, and that a smallsub-Committee should prepare a scheme to have men ready from the threeIservices to run the Power Stations in the event of the threatened toppage of work taking place.  Considerable progress in the prepara- ion of the scheme has been made, and further steps are being taken o have the arrangements completed and ready to put into operation t short notice.   A second meeting of the Committee was held on 23rd November for the specific purpose of considering the threatened  stoppage of membersbf the Electrical Trades Union in protest against the refusal of theManagement of the Royal Albert Hall to allow the use of the halliiOr a meeting called by mr. George Lansbury and colleagues.  In iOnnection with this protest the Union cut off  the electric  light &quot;or the Royal Albert Hall and an extension of the strike was threatened, the matter was, however,  settled by the management withdrawing the If1refusal on my recommendation.[   In the course of the discussion the Committee  considered  the altered circumstances  occasioned by the signing of the Armistice.  In;iy previous memorandum special mention was made of munitions factories, he relative  importance of which is, however, now  considerablyiliminished.   There remain the questions of Cold Storage  Installation md the Hospitals, and of course regard must be had  to  the effect ;hich a sudden  stoppage of the Electrical Power Undertakings would have on the general public.  The possibility of a general  and  sudden stoppage of members of the Electrical  Trades Union still  remains  and he decision  of the Cabinet  is desired  on the  point  whether  they  would: still be willing that  men from the  three  services should  be  utilised ,o run the Electrical  Power  Stations In  the  event of  such stoppage -aking place.                                   (Signed)  GEO.H.ROBERTS.&quot;t&quot;y&apos; ofiment.)
