        0. 1/180/517.t            MEMORANDUM   ON   OUR   PRESENT   AND  FUTURE                          MILITARY  POLICY  IN  RUSSIA.    1. The  policy of military intervention in &quot;Russia  was adopted by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment :      (a.)  In  order to prevent Germany from drawing assistance from Russia and Siberia           in man-power and supplies.    (b.)  To  retain on the  Russian Front enemy resources in  men and material, which           would otherwise have been available for use on other fronts.    (c.)  To  prevent  the  acquisition  by  Germany of a  preponderating  influence in           Russian affairs after the war.    2. The  first two of these objects  have  disappeared with the signing of  thearmistice.  The  third object alone remains, which, however,  may almost be described as the &quot; war after the war.&quot;    3. Our  intervention was without precise  geographical military objectives,  but  theabove desiderata were  to a  great  measure  attained,  as   may be  seen  from  thefollowing :     (l.)  The Czechs  were encouraged  to  maintain themselves  on a line which denied           the vast resources of Western Siberia to the enemy.    (2.)  Passive resistance to  the Germans  was encouraged throughout: Russia  and           the Ukraine, with the result  that  supplies were  often burnt rather than           delivered to the enemy.    (3.)  On the 6th March  there  were in Russia 52 German infantry divisions  and            261  squadrons.   By  the  17fh April  these  figures had  been reduced by           withdrawals  to the Western  Front to 36  and 191 respectively.  Five           months later (on 25th September)  there  were still in Russia 34  German           infantry  divisions   and 176  squadrons,  although throughout  this period           there was very heavy fighting on the Western Front.    It   can, therefore,  be  reasonably claimed that  the decision  of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Allied Governments to  intervene in Russia has been justified by results, even if,  owing to the inaction of the  Japanese and Americans,  these have  notbeen so favourable as had been hoped for.    4. In considering any action in  Russia  during the armistice it must  be  borne inmind  that the time may be short, and  that any action initiated  may not be capable of&quot;fulfilment unless it  is extended  after peace terms have been  signed.   We must be  &apos;careful, therefore, to start nothing which we are not prepared  to continue after  peace isdeclared.    5. The  advocates of  continued intervention in Russia base  their opinion on  thefollowing grounds:     (a.)  That Bolshevism is a  danger  to  the world (including, of course, the  Central            Powers) and must be crushed.    (b.)  That if we  do not do so the time will come when the Germans will, and  in the            process of so doing obtain a preponderating influence in Russia.    (c.)  That we cannot leave those  who have  helped  us to the tender  mercies of the            Bolsheviks, and that  without further  intervention  we may  not  be able to            extricate certain of our troops.    6. Taking the first of these  reasons (a.) From  the above it  is  clear that  theconsideratians involved in the question are mainly political, and  it is impossible  to avoidtouching on them when  considering  military action.  Bolshevism is a  cult if  not a    (L518/455)  GO 11/18  II&amp;S 6538wo
religion.   It flourishes in rank soil, such as exists in Russia owing to complete  isolationfrom the outside world for several years, involving stoppage of  trade and of all peacefulavocations ;  conditions which are abnormal, even in Russia.   Like all cults, if  radicallyunsound,  as we  think it  is, it cannot long survive the  re-establishment of normalconditions in the rest of the world.   If, however,,it is better than we are prepared  to admit, it will gradually develop into a  higher organism and we cannot permanentlystifle it by military action.    If the above is admitted, it is clear that our real object is as indicated in (b.) : i.e.,to  prevent  the  Germans from  deiiving benefit which  might  accrue to them fromcombating Bolshevism, and which would lead to the practical absorption of the BorderStates which  they have created and bolstered up during the war.  Such absorptionwould, however, only last until  such  time as Russia was strong enough to contest  it,in which case these States would  become  &quot;Russian  Irridenta.&quot;  As regards (a),  toabandon our friends  is contrary to British principles ; but provided that we place themin an initial position  to defend themselves, we  shall have  given  them a fair chance.If the Bolshevists are the  better men, we cannot indefinitely continue to protect the others.    As regards  extricating our troops,  those at Archangel are the  only ones about which there might be some  difficulty, but no doubt  the Bolshevists would be  only toopleased to assist&apos;us to bring them away by land, should this be desired while Archangelis ice-bound.    7.  Should we decide that continued or more efficient intervention  is necessary, wehave two main alternatives  :     (a.) The first is to create a  ring of States all round Bolshevik Russia, the object           being to prevent Bolshevism from spreading ; to deprive it of supplies and           power of expansion, and so  reduce it to absolute  exhaustion.  This would           entail incidentally  the  starvation  of large numbers  of people, and would           require the  occupation  by  Allied  troops of  the Border States for  an           indefinite  period, i.e., until non-Bolshevik Russia was obviously going up.           whilst Bolshevik Russia was going down.                On the Bolshevik Western Front there ap ears a reasonable probability           that the withdrawal of German  troops will result in  some of the Border           States being over-run by the Bolsheviks, in which case the Germans may           filter back, unless their place is taken in the meantime by  Allied troops.  A           proposal for creating a chain  of States and for garrisoning them has been           considered, but  it must again  be  pointed out that the period of occupation           under such a  scheme would be of  unknown  duration.   From  a  puiely           military point  of view  such  a plan is indefensible, for it  is one of passive           resistance and of complete surrender of the initiative to the Bolsheviks.  It           involves the dispersal of forces  in  small packets over an enormous area,           none strong enough to effect anything, whilst the  Bolsheviks from their           central position can concentrate  against any one, and each will, be a source           of anxiety.  In the end such a policy  may  entail  the  larger operations           outlined  in (/;), and at a time when we may  be  less prepared  to undertake         , them than at present.     (6.)l//The second alternative is to grasp the  nettle firmly by  taking active military           measures with  a view  to crushing  Bolshevism definitely at  the  earliest           possible  date.   This is the quicker and  more  certain plan of checkmating           possible German expansion, since the Border States would  once more come           into the  orbit  of a  united Russia, the only Power that  can permanently           check German   expansion eastwards ; but there are great  difficulties in  the            way of such action,     (c.) There is a third course, namely,  to compel the Germans  to hand over arms and           equipment to the  States which they are evacuating, to  repatriate troops           which our friends may possess, and generally to  give  them such assistance            as is  practicable short of  troops,  and then to let them do the best they can.     8.  Should we decide  on course (a), namely, the occupation of  a ring of Border-States, we must have a definite plan  for  providing the necessary garrisons after Peacehas been signed, and for reinforcing them as and when required.  The  British army has enlisted mainly on a &quot; Duration of the War &quot; basis, and this  latter term cannot  beheld  to cover a desultory-campaign of indefinite duration  in Eastern  Europe  and Asiaagainst  an enemy  with whom the British public  has no particular quarrel.   It is unlikely that the country would agree  to  the  continuance of  the present recruiting
system for such a purpose.   Whether the French and Americans are better situated asregards troops is very doubtful, and it appears  unlikely that the latter country wouldbe prepared to assist us; though if she were, the problem would be much simplified.     9. The second alternative, namely, to act energetically against the Bolsheviks hasdistinct advantages, provided that it is carried out with sufficient force, and  against those portions of Russia in which Bolshevism flourishes, namely, the large towns.   Itmight take the form of a concentric advance from  the  east, the  south  and from thenorth, this latter, based on the Baltic and  directed against Moscow, forming the mainoperation.&apos; Such operations would enable us to extricate our Archangel force, liquidate ourTrans-Caspian, Murman and Siberian commitments, and render possible the repatriation of  the  Czechs, Poles,  prisoners of  war.  &amp;c,  in  Siberia across  Europe.   This planconstitutes the only certain method of dealing a  fatal blow  to  Bolshevism within adefinite time. It is, however, confronted by grave difficulties, both political and military.In  the  first instance the support of the British public must  be  obtained, which wouldnot be easy, and as it would be in direct opposition  to American views, such action mightweaken our position  at  the Peace Conference.   In the event of a change in the attitudeof the United States the matter must be viewed in another light.     The military difficulties are very considerable, particularly during  the winter the climate and  vast  extent of the  country  are enemies iar more formidable than. theBolsheviks, whilst the  most convenient avenues of approach would be ice-bound.  Inview of these difficulties we  could not rely on finishing  the campaign until the summer of 1919, and might therefore be faced with the difficulty of maintaining an Army fighting in Russia after  peace is  declared.     10. One course only remains, namely, to do  all  we can in the way of material to giveour friends a fair start, and then to  withdraw.  The  measures which it is suggested should be taken in each theatre are outlined below :      (a.)  Western Russian Front. A reconstituted Poland will.be the most important&apos;           State,  and  the  only  one likely to be able to make  head unaided  against           Bolshevism.  The first  essential is the  re-forming  of Dowbor-Musnicki&apos;s           Army, numbering some 70,000 men, and the transfer of Haller&apos;s Corps  of           ;iO.OOO from France.  The above should be supplied with sufficient arms and           ammunition, either  by the  retiring Germans or by  the&apos; Allies,  and the           Polish contingents now being raised from  prisoners  of war should  also be           repatriated.  Provision has  been  made for  this in Clause XVI.  of the           Armistice.                In the  Ukraine conditions are likely to prove thoroughly unsatisfactory,           and when the German troops are withdrawn the country may become a prey           to  Bolshevism.    Our  policy  should be to  support stable elements with           money, stores and ammunition once the  Black Sea is opened, whilst Rumania           should occupy Bessarabia, and so form a barrier on the west.                Lithuania, - Latvia  and Esthonia  remain.     The  ultimate political           settlement as regards these provinces is a; matter for. the Peace Conference, if           it can be decided at all until Russia as recovered her stability in some form           or other.  Meanwhile all  that the Allies can  do  is to supply arms  to  such           National Governments  as  are  capable of exercising  de facto authority on           evacuation by Germany, and to  afford them such moral support from the           Baltic coast as naval conditions may render possible.     (6.) Northern Front. Our policy should aim at effecting a settlement between Finns           and Karelians, so that the integrity  of Karelia may no longer rest on the           bayonets of the British troops along the Murman Railway, although it is           impossible yet to say when these may be withdrawn.                Archangel  must  also  be  held during  the  coming  winter,  but our           commitment must  in no  way be increased, and every effort must  be made           to enable the local Russians to  hold their own unaided should it  be decided           to withdraw our troops in  the  spring.     (c.) Eastern Front. The enemy&apos;s main strength is  derived from prisoners  of war,           who should  all be repatriated at the earliest possible  moment.  Clause XIH.           of  the Armistice with Germany  provides for the  recall  of the German           prisoners, without whom the Austriaus will probably be of little value, even           if they do not return  to their homes.   It is improbable that the Czechs will           be willing to continue fighting now  that  the  armistice has been signed, and           still less, when peace has been made.   The mobilization ordered by the new           Russian  Government at  Omsk has met  with  a considerable measure  of )A / V/
           success, and in co-operation with the French we should afford all possible          Jmaterial  assistance for  the  formation and training  of Russian  Armies in           Siberia.   The sooner  these  armies  are ahle, unaided, to hold Siberia  and           the Eastern Front against die Bolsheviks, the sooner will we be released from           our commitment in this region.               The question  ot  recognizing  the  Omsk  Government  in   order  to           strengthen their hands in raising iorces in Siberia and elsewhere  should be           be considered in this connection.    (d.) &quot;Caucasus and  Trans-Cdspia. There are considerable anti-Bolshevik forces in           the North Caucasus  and the Don country under  Denikin and Krasnoff,           whose  principal need is arms and ammunition, which  hitherto we have been           unable to supply.  This  difficulty will, however, disappear with (he opening           of the  Black  Sea, and the early arrival of arms should enable  the ahove           forces to take  the offensive.against the Bolsheviks.   We should  then be in           a position to withdraw our detachments east of the Caspian.  It is doubtful           whether  there is  any  object in maintaining the North Persian Lines of           Communication to the Caspian, once the Black  Sea is open.   A friendly           Turkey will form an effective barrier to the expansion of the Central  Powers           eastwards, and the sole object of our advance to the Caspian, namely, the           protection of the-marches to India, disappears.    11. Conclusion. (i.)  The  general  conclusion is that  we  should liquidate  our commitments in troops at  the earliest possible moment,  aiming at their complete withdrawal  from  European  Russia by  the time  Peace has  been  signed, and theestablishment of a firm Russian Government in  Siberia at the earliest possible moment.    (ii.) That we  should  take immediate  advantage of the opening  of the Baltic toprovide our friends with warlike stores, and of the opening of the Black Sea to occupysuch ports on its eastern shores as may be necessary in order to extend a hand to those elements in the Caucasus which tend to make a stable Russian Government.
