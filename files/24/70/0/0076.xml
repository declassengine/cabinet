The Committee recognize that since they made their original recommenda-titns the situation has been materially altered by the signing of theArmistice, and particularly in relation to finance.  Demobilization will begin at an earlier date than was anticipated, and an emergency has arisenwhioh makes it imperative to devise some additional and  quicker method ofobtaining land in order to meet the requirements of men  returning fromactive service.   After further consideration, the Committee desire to makethe following supplementary recommendations   (l) The Government should provide County Councils with funds on loan,     up to a limit of  20,000,000, for the purchase of land for small     holdings, cottage sites and gardens, and allotments for ex-Service men,     and for the adaptation and equipment of the land by the erection of     cottages, fencing, water-supply, drainage, etc.*   (2) The Board of Agriculture should be authorized to  inform County     Councils that 75 per cent**of any deficiency between income and   1  expenditure in respect of the working of the stheme will be paid by     the Board at the end of each financial year, provided that the sanction     of the Board has been obtained to the acquisition of the land and the     general plan of and the amount to be expended on adaptation and     equipment.   (3) Provision should be made for training ex-Service  men who desire to *With a view to fitting this transaction into  the  general scheme of the  Committee, power might be reserved, subject to the  consent of Parliament,  to satisfy any such loan by the grant or a perpetual annuity charged on  the County funds.**The figure of the percentage to be the same as that to be adopted in the iiHousing Bill.
  settle or ta obtain employment  on the land by the following methods:-&apos;      (a)  Placing them on the farms (comprising at present some 20,000             acres)  of which possession has been taken tinder the Defence             of  the  Realm Regulations and whioh are being farmed by the             Agricultural Executive Committees.      (b)  Placing them,  under an  arrangement analogous to apprenticeship,             with seleoted farmers, who would pay wages at the minimum             rate for the oounty  fized by the wages Board, but would in             return  for  the education afforded receive a small considera-             tion from the Board,      (c)  Authorizing County Councils, acting as agents for the Board, to             aquire farms on short tenancies to be used for the training             of  ex-Servioe men, if  the other means mentioned above proved             insufficient.  In this case the Board would have to provide the             farming capital for  stocking and working the farms, including             the wages of the men.(4) The  existing machinery of Agricultural Companies and Depots should be&apos;  retained for the purpose of distributing the men either for employment  or training.(5) It  has  been represented to the Committee that many landowners who do .  not desire  to sell  would be willing to provide land for ex-Service men  if assistance could be  given to them towards the cost of housing,  adaptation, and  equipment, and it  is probable that many holdings could  be provided in this way with less  displacement of existing occupiers and  labour,- and at less cost than if the provision were undertaken by the  County Councils. The Committee think that this suggestion should in  some  form be adopted.   But, as a consideration of any financial assistance,  the landowner should be required,  so long as the loan remains unpaid, to  acoept the  conditions necessary to secure to the tenant, subject to good  cultivation and  other usual stipulations, fixity of tenure and a fair  rent.  It might  be  desirable, as regards minor improvements, that assistance  should be given  to  the  tenant, and in that case the lending authority should  be given  a  charge for the amount of the advance on any sum coming to the  tenant by way of compensation for  improvements at the end of his tenancy^(6) These  further  proposals would apply to Scotland with the modifications  required for  bringing them  into oonformity with Scottish law and practice.CAVE.25th November,  1918.
