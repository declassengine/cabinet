    Cereal Prices for 3 93 9 in r^,4J^oil,toJRa a3,JjJMAfl&amp;*          I desire to support strong]y  the Memorandum of thePresident of the Bo-^r-A of Agriculture and Fisheries  (G.T.627 6).  I MI convinced th t  it  is  impossible   to  malce anyserious progress towards the solution of the  Rural Housing  ,problem until some pronouncement  of  the Governmentfsft&amp;ricu3 tural pol icy has &quot;been made,   Neither Local Authoritiesnor other agencies can be expected to embark  on extensiveprogrammes of cottage building  in agricultural  areas  withoutsoroo degree of assurance of  the future  of agriculture, and I regard the announcement for v/hich Mr. Prothero asks  as a valuable first step in this  direction.
