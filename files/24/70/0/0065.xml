I  shall, however,arrange that your  suggestion shall  &quot;be  considered  as  soon aspossible try the  Cabinet.                             Yours  truly.Charles  Tennyson,  Esq.,       (signed)   A.BONAR LAW.      Acting Director,             Federation  of British  Industries.
                    RESOLUTIONS.                               I.                   IHDUSTRIAL DEMOBILISATION.RESOLVED;          That the Federation of British  Industries regards thenotice issued &quot;by tho Ministry of Munitions on Monday, 11th instant,and  subsequent Notice, with,apprehension and alarm.          The request rapidly to convert Piece-Workers to Time Work, .to shorten hours,- ana suspend overtime, cannot but cause dissatis -faction and unrest amongst  skilled workers.  It moreover completelyupsets production cost, and by introducing fresh conditions into thecircumstances of contracts, puts an end to all contract prices.          Industry - as represented by the Federation - is anxiousto convert to ?oace work speedily and with.as little dislocation to labour as possible.  The Federation, therefore, claims that industry should be consulted on a vital question such as this, before  it is published or given effect to.          The 12-&amp;$ wages award was granted before consultation with employers.  It caused endless complaints, and eventually had -to be conceded to all workers instead of only to skilled workers on timework as was intended.   Conversely the Federation view with alarmthe situation which a general transfer to Time work will create.It is further accentuated by the terms of the non-contributaryallowance which places the  worker on half time in most cases  in aless advantageous position  to those entirely out of work.          The Federation are pleased, to have been permitted to nominate representatives on. the Advisory Committee set up by theMinistry of Munitions in connection with the Board of Demobilisation.They, however, regard the scooe both of the Board and of the AdvisoryCommittee as insufficient.   It is not far reaching enough to coverall the vital conditions likely to arise affecting the Industries ofthe conn Dry.   It is suggested that there is at present no co-ordiria-tion between the four principal departments concerned, viz:-  theMinistry of Munitions. War  Office, Admiralty and Labour Department.Thus different methods may  be adopted by the various PurchasingDepartments of determining  their contracts.  This raake-s- it verydifficult for producers carrying out contracts, for two or moredepartments, while, in the cancellation of contracts, sufficientattention is not paid to the necessities of the Labour situation andto making the best possible provision for the. conversion-from. War- to peace Industries.          The demobilisation of contracts is so intimately bound up with the demobilisation  of labour and the conversion from war to Peace Industries,  that it is i per?tive that a Supreme Committeeshould be at once appointed, consisting of tho Ministers of PrincipalOfficers of the various Departments, involved, together with a fewleading men in the Industrial world, to advise them..   This&apos;SupremeCommittee should co-ordinate and direct tho policy of the Department?and Committees concerned, among which Committees should be oneappointed from the three great&apos;Purchasing Departments, namely, theMinistry o$ Munitions,, the Admiralty and the T/ar Office, to dealwith the demobilisation of  contracts.          During the  War, Industry was cuite content to do whatthe Government required and felt was necessary to win the War.Under the altered circumstances of re-establishing Industry,  the producers of the country feel strongly that the time has arrivedwhen they have the right to insist that they should be consulted in what is to be done, and before it1is&apos;done.
     Clearly the future of the country depends upon thoprosperity of its industries, end the Federation claims thatthere is no better way of quickly arriving &amp;t prosperitythan by taking those most directly affected into the eon-licence of the Government, ana thus giving Industry theopportunity of effectively expressing its requirements.                    tCONTROL OF 3)QM^X&apos;7:0,PHIOHI!I?Y AND RATIONING,THAT the Federation urges upon the J?rimo Mini3tor  (1)  The advisability of appointing a Central Controller     of domestic priority and rationing from among the     members cf the Indue trio 3 of the conircry:(&amp;)  That the general administration and co-ordination of the     relevant Departmental Control should be in the hands of     the Central Controller subject to the policy of the Pest-     War Priority Cabinet Committee;(3)  That the Federation suggests that the Federation of     British Industries should be consulted prior to such     appointment.
