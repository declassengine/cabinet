You are aware  of  public            statements already made  by Secretary of .itate  for Foreign            Affairs and by myself,  though we spoke  for  ourselves            we had  the entire  approval and. assent of  the i rime Minister            and  ou\r colleagues,   iiis uajesty&apos;s Government will give            their whole support to the claims of the  Dominions  and            the Prime minister has made this clear already to the            representatives  of the. Allies in Paris.                 (2 k 3) Tariffs and  Trade.   There was nothing in            the  attitude  assumed by  the British representatives  which            impaired in any  way the  complete freedom  of  action  of            Great Britain or the Dominions in regard  to  economic policy..            Nothing has been done by the Government whioh  will make            it impossible OP even difficult for them  to  carry out            the  recommendations arrived at at Imperial War Cabinet            meetings last year and this&apos;year when representatives            of the  Dominions were present.                      if  questioned in  the house your Acting i rime            liiinister is at liberty to make a statement in  this sense.
