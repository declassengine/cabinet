Representatives, between&apos;June and August last,          PI     For the above purpose  they have asked for           extra coal to the amount  61&quot;-&apos;200,000 tons&apos;,  but. this          . is, unlikely&apos; to be made available.,- As the reserve          -will be rapidly dissipated and cannot&apos;be replaced^           the Military Representatives&apos;&apos; views are  requested as                                                           to
         to whether this reser-re is still required for         its original object, or whether the Italian        &apos; requirements referred, to above render its         use essential,&apos;&apos;He then called on the British ^ilitary Representative&quot; toexpress his views.GENERAL SACKVILLJE-V/KST said that the situation had altered so      considerably since the creation of the strategic reserve      of coal had been determined upon that it might be useful      in the first place to re-consider the question.  It would      be admitted that the reasons for which the reserve had      been formed, that is to say, to facilitate the transport      of troops from France to Italy, h.&quot;d changed, as had also      the coax requirements of Itely,   As-a matter of fact, the      strategic reserve was so small in comparison to the enormous      requirements of Italy, that the two questions.must be con-      sidered separately.   The Inter-.-.11 led Transportation Council      had reported that Italy would now re quire 800,000. tons of      coal monthly instead of 690,000 tons at present supplied.  It      would appear, how aver, that the. additional quantity as Iced for      could not at present be made available from the United      Zingdom.  3?iur the. raprs, if the Military Uepresentatives now      agreed that the reserve stock cf 150,000 tons should be used      up, it did. net apoear that it would    possible in the near      future to reconstitute this reserve.  It w:;s true that a      certain number of miners might now be called back from the      Army,  out some time would have to elapse before any real      increase in the output of coal would be obtained.QSNSRAh PI ROBILAilT as-oed permission to expiain the situation,      eSijecially^as there appeared to be some misunderstanding,      Italy had not as,-red to ma.ee use of the well-known strategic      coal reserve.   The Italian Minister of Transportation had      merely communicated to the Inter-Allied Transportation      Council the application which had been put forward by Italy      for an increase in the monthly coal supplies from 690,000      tons to 800,000 tons.    It was of the greatest importance      to obtain an immediate increase in the monthly supplies of      coal to Italy,&apos; in order to meet the requirements of the      railways which would now have to be organised in the freed      territories,  recently occupied.   He had received the      following communication from the Italian minister ofi     Trans oo rta 11 on          &quot;Telegram dated Home, November 4th, 1918 :-               I beg to inform you that I have applied to the          British Government through our representative in          London for an increase of coal supplies from 690,000          to 800,000 tons monthly to be sent direct by sea.          Estimate  is &apos; based on the new requirements owing to          victorious advance of&apos;our Armies,   Please ask          Inter-Allied Transportation Council to support.          appliestion,                           (Signed)   itinister Villa,&quot;                                                And
And, as hia colleagues already knew, the Inter-AlliedTransportation Council had on the 9th November last passed the following resolution&quot;The Inter-Allied Transportation  Council are unanimous in supporting the  request of the Italian Minister of  Transportation for increasing the  monthly  deliveries  of coal to Italy to 900,COO tons per month.  They have already recorded their opinion  that, in view of the general railway  transportation situation nv the Continent,  delivery of  coal to Italy should be  made by  sea  in order  to relieve the Railways in France.&quot;     From the above it would be seen that there was really onlyone question which he wished to urge, namely,  the increase inthe monthly allocation of coal to Italy,  in order to providefor the existing transportation requirements,     As regards the strategic reserve,  it must- be realised inthe first plaeo that a portion of this reserve,  consisting ofcwal of inferior quality which could not &quot;bo stored without ,serious deterioration for a longer period than 3 months,  had been used,  also in order to prevent spontaneous oornbustion owingto the formation of coal dust.  Til? Minister of Transportationhad, for this reason,  given permission for the withdrawal of10,000 tons from the strategic reserve stock;  but it was proposedto replace this from the monthly supplies.  The fact teat this quantity had been used had been notified, and  it was probablythis fact -which had given rise to the idea that the ItalianGovernment wished to make use of the strategic reserve.   This,however ^ was not the case.     In conclusion, he asked the Military Representatives toaccept the following draft Joint Note&apos;,  which was intendedto put the whole question on a proper footing  :-          &quot;After taking cognizance of the Resolution of     the Inter-Allied Transportation Council of 9th     November,  1318, the Military Representatives,           CONSIDERING     (a)   the present coal crisis in Yene-tia,. Friuli         and the restored districts, together  with the         need for the re-organisation, in those regions:     (b)   the importance of utilising certain portions         of the coal -accumulated for the well-known         strategic reserve, as they have deteriorated         and need renewal;     (a)   the request of the Italian Minister of         Transportation that the monthly supply of coal         to Italy be increased from. 690,000 to 800,000         tons:           ARE 0&quot;F OPINION THAT:
          (l)    The strategic reserve must,  as far a.s. possible,              still be maintained.          (?)    The above-mentioned transport crisis must be              remedied ;-              (a)    by increasing the monthly allocation to the                 e x t e n t s t a t e d ab o ve :              (b)    by supplying the requisite tonnage to carry                 the whole- of the coal far Italy by sea,  in                 order to relieve the railways between Franca                 and Italy.&quot;GENERA! BEL IN wished to place on record  the fact that though    &quot;allusion was made to a resolution passed by the Inter-Allied     Transportation Council on the 9th November,  1918, the French     Section of the Supreme War Council had never received a copy     of the same.           As regards the strategic reserve,  he had consulted     Marshal Foch.  His views were that an armistice was not     peace,  and conaequently it was, in his opinion, essential that     the strategic preserve should be maintained.   On the other hand     if Italy found itself faced with a coal crisis, he would agree     to this stock being, reduced to 100,000 tons which must, however     be considered a minimum figure.  General Belin thought,     however, that on the question of the necessity for maintaining     the strategic coal reserve in Italy,  the Military represent-     tives were in complete agreement.           He was quite prepared to support General di Robilant&apos;s     re-quest for an increase in the monthly allocation of coal     to Italy,  always provided,  on the one hand,  that Great     Britain was in a position to supply the coal ana, on the other     hand, that the Allied Maritime Transport Council could arrange     far. the necessary tonnage,   In his opinion,  coal was undoubted&apos;     ly required for military reasons, in view of the occupation of     new territories: but whether the coal could be obtained in     the JJnited Kingdom and the tonnage could be  made available,     was a meet question.  The British Military Representative     had stated that at present there would be difficulties, but     the situation might change in the near future owing to     additional man-power and tonnage being made available.GENERAL  HISS said he understood from the draft Joint Note which     had been submitted by the Italian Military Representative     that certain necessities existed which were not at present     reconcilable, but which might become reconcilable later on.     It was evident that in certain portions of Italy a coal     crisis existed owing to the re-occupation of certain terri-     taries, and the resulting transportation requirements.  In     order to meet this crisis the Italian Military representative     proposed,  whilst recognising the necessity of maintaining     the strategic reserve, to use it on condition that it could     immediately be replaced by coal of better quality.  From     the statement made by the British Military Representative,     it would appear that for an unknown period of time it     would be impossible to replace this reserve stock.  And, if     it was impossible to replace the reserve, it followed that     it would be impossible to errant the increase asked for in     the monthly supplies.  That left them face to face with a     orisis which must either be endured or temporarily     relieved by using up the strategic reserve,&quot;                ^                                                          As
      An regards the use of this, reserve,  he himself must he entire31.-      guided by th&quot; vi-*ws of Marshal Foehj who had r t*ntly b**n made.      responsible for th&apos;1 operations on all fronts.   An they all      kri&apos;&quot;.&apos;/, a plan for operating through Austria against Germany had    .&apos;, b-w?n pr-par^d which would, however,  probably not now b^      &quot;brought into us?.  . ih v-rtheless  aa. G-n ral Bwlin had said,      arraisti.ee was not peao^.   Thor**fore,  should this r- s^rve      be us^d up without Marshal Foch&apos;s tonsant, the Marflial might      find himself faoe to face with a situation In-, could not m^et      owing to thiA dissipation of this res-r^o.   Th^ question      therefore cam..-; to. this;  could. Italy endure &quot;the crisis for      the  period of 3C days of thft armistice?  And, if so, could      GrK-at Britain begin to supply th*% increased quantity of ooal .      askf.-d for at the end of that time, owing to the &quot;return of      miners from the colours and owing to more tonnage being      available?GENERAL di ROBILANT. held that the two questions, (the strategic      coal reserve and&apos;the .increase of - monthly ,f*oal supplies), must      be leapt aha jlutely feaparat.*.y   Th*.y wnre all agreed that -th-&apos;-      strategic coal reserve must b-&quot;1 maintained.   He himself had-      express-, d that same vi-.vw r*e**ntly to Marshal foch*  And to      remove any doubt, he was pr-&quot;*par d to&apos; suppress thes- words &quot;as      far as possible&quot; in-paragraph (l) of his draft Joint Noto.      Th/  Italian Government had already,  on its own&apos;initiative.,      taken steps to substitute good coal for thr. coalwhioh had    -  deteriorated.   It was only owing to shortage in the monthly      supplies that the- whol--&quot; quantity so&apos; withdrawn had not up to      tht- present b^en replaced, but - only a slight deficit at      pr- s- nt exist-d.            It Nwas important, however, to increase thp monthly      allocation of&apos; coal by 110,000 tons,  and th^ possibility of      this being done required to b* studied .since it implied the      possibility of providing the coal and the tonnage.   He,      therefore, merely asked the Military Representatives to accept      the-resolution passed by the Inter-Allied Transportation      Council and to strengthen their hands by accepting; the draft      Joint Rote which he had placed before them.GENERAL SACKVILLE-WjjST said that they were all agreed as regards the      maintenance of the strategic reserve of coal.   Nothing      more need therefore be said on that point.            As regards the second part of the draft Joint Note, the      increase of aoal allocation to Italy., he was quite prepared      to accept the recommendations therein&apos;contained with certain      modifications.   His colleagues would agree that he could      not  say that tho &quot;transport crisis must be remedied&quot; in the      manner tsuggsstKC., because he     not&quot; fs a position to  dictate      to his Government.   But,, i,to- was quite prepared to say that      the  &quot;transport crisis should be r em a died&quot;.   He would      therefore propose that paragraph (2) of the draft Joint Note      should read as follows  :-           &apos;&quot;(2)     , The above mentioned transport crisis should                be studied by the Governments *oncornod with a                view t*t                &apos;(&amp;)     increasing in the firwt. place the .monthly                     allocation from France and&apos; England to the                     extent stated above,                (b)     supplying the requisite tonnage to oarry                     th* who.Jo  of the coal for  Italy  by -sea.,  in                     ord-r to rell^v- th- railways between France                     and Italy.&quot;                                                 GEKSRAL BEL 111
GEflER&amp;L EEL IN  said that h^ must d&apos;*mur to &quot;aec^pting any suggestion      that -any incr*as&apos;,,^ ia th* monthly allocation could b*      obtained from France.   On account of th* r*-occupation of      n*w territories,&apos; France wo&quot;uld also in all&apos; probability find      itailf fao* to fac*-with a s*serious coal&apos;crisis, so much so,      that it might b* nfcc*ssary for her also to ask foriner asod      supplies,-   It would-be impossible to say how long it would      be before either the French.or&apos;tho Belgian mines in the  &apos; .      recently occupied areas could be got into working order.      They had been utterly&apos; destroyed and, for example, the min^s      of Lens &quot;could not be&apos;worked for 8 or 10 years to come.      Consequently, he thought that it would be wise not to      suggest a possible increase in- the supplies to. be obtained      from the French mines.GENEHAL di ROBILANT thought that General Belin&apos;s remarks would.      prol^^bly not apply tc the&apos;mirKs of Saar, also-ce and&apos;      Lorraine,   &apos;          :  .&apos;&quot;              .  -  .GENERAL BELIN replied that it was possible that the Gaar and     &apos; Lorraine mines -might be left in&apos; good condition,   But they      could not guarantee this, -&apos; Therefore, it was wiser not to      consider any increase from France and ha would ask that the    ,- word franco be omitted,   ,It would bo useless to ask.for      the studies to bo made on subjects which wore irrealizable.QEIISRAL di.. ROBILANT  suggested the substitution of  uhc words      &quot;&quot;&quot;from the coal producing countries&quot; for &quot;from.
