fSOfiQBMti/2  ,            .THE DISPOSAL OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.             &quot;  /      I should be glad to receive as soon as possible a  decision  of the WarCabinet regarding the disposal of conscientious  objectors  so far  as they  cone                 *vrithin the jurisdiction of my department.            &apos;   &apos; &apos; &apos;&quot;&apos;           -&quot; &apos;      The men concerned are:-    -                           &apos;&apos;   (l) The men in prison.   These number about Lr.00.   (?.) The men working under the direct control  of the  Brace Committee.   Of these      600 are employed at the Committee&apos;s Work Centre at Dartmoor, and the re-      mainder, 761 in number, at various camps in different  parts of the  country.      These men are kept under fairly strict control  and discipline, and  are      liable  in the event of a serious breach of the Committee&apos;s Rules,  at any      moment  to be recalled from Arny Reserve V/  to the Colours.   They cannot be&apos;      kept in confinement nor are they liable to arrest  if they abscond,  until      they have been recalled to the Army.    Any concerted action therefore to      abscond would probably be successful.   (3) The men, numbering 2221, who have served  for 12 months and upwards under the      Brace Gommittee with good conduct and  industry, and  have, in accordance      with the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee,  been allowed to take up      *exceptional employment&apos;  in work of national importance.   The only restric-      tions placed upon  these men- arc (a) that  their employment must be  approved      by the Brace Committee, and (b) that they  must  not engage in propaganda.      Any breach of these conditions may result  in their being returned to class      The men in classes (2) and (3) above are all in Army Reserve V/, and aretherefore legally liable to be recalled at any moment to the  Colours.    But anysuch recall, unless for good reason in each individual case,  might fairly beheld to be a breach of faith.      A oertain number (about 30 in all) of the men in class  (2)  have,  since the signing of the Armistice, absconded from the places where they are employed.These have been or arc; being recalled to the Army,   From information in mypossession however I have reason to believe that there is a concerted movementamong the men at Dartmoor to abscond in large numbers.   Such steps  as  are possible have been taken to deal with any such occurrence:  but it is most impcr&quot;-tant that an early and definite announcement S would be made as to the intentions of t he X G ov e r nme nt.      The,foll&apos;ovdng considerations appear to be the most important.   On the onehand there is a strong popular feeling that these men should not  be  free to returnto oivil life until the whole or nearly the whole of the Array, at home  and abroad *has been demobilised, und should not have a better chance of obtaining  employmentthen men who have served in the Army.   On the other hand there is a demand fromthe extreme Liberal and Labour wings for their immediate amnesty.   Demobilisationwill not be oomplete for a long time, and I do not think it would be possible tokeep the men in prison, and still less the men under the Brace Committee, until(2).
Ifdemobilisation is complete.    The  main justification for keepingthese men under restrictions  has hitherto  been the fact that in theabsence of any such restriction there  would  be a  strong inducement to others to follow their example.   This  justification no longercontinued detention is merely penal and  amounts  to  persecution of religious and political opinion.      In all the circumstances I  recommend  that  the T&apos;ur cabinet should at once decide that,  as soon as the;  terms of the Armisticehave been carried out and demobilisation begins  - that is to  say,  if all goes well, in about five weeks  from  the present time - the menin class (?), i.e. the men under  the direct control of the BraceCommittee should be discharged and  permitted to  return to civil life,As regards the men in class  (3),  iee. those who  have  been permitted to take up exceptional employment,  I recommend that these should be discharged forthwith from the control of the Committee,   It  is very important to announce a decision  as regards classes (2) and  (3) early next week;  as otherwise we  may be  faced with a  strike and a  generaldispersal of the men, which would serionsly prejudice the wholequestion.      The men in class (l),  i.e.  the men in prison, having been sentenced by Oourt Martial,  vrould be dealt  with  on  the recommendationof the Secretary of State for r*ar;   but I think  it  very desirablethat ,pi ir-g^JUdpr-icHrm should be taken as to their case also.exists,  and in its  absence  it  would  no  doubt be said that their16NQVI9I8ii
