Dr. *Karl  Hoffmann&apos;s book,  &quot; Das Ende  des kolonialpolitischen  Zeitalters,&quot;        describes how popular interest in Germany has shifted from one scheme        to another during the war, according  to the situation of the moment.$ 3. Evidence that the interest in colonies in bourgeois circles has tended to fade.I 4. Such  interest, on the other hand, has grown in Labour circles.$ 5. Early attitude of Social Democracy to  colonies  was negative.  A  colonial        policy was repudiated  (1) because  colonies  brought no profit to  the        German  working  class;  (2)  on  humanitarian  grounds; (3)  because        colonies served the purposes  of Weltpolitik.I 6. Later on, especially after the Dernburg- reforms, opinion in the party became        divided.   The question arose whether such a thing was  possible  as a        colonial policy consistent with Socialist principles.I 7. The effect  of the war.  Dr. Adolf Koster quoted.  The  blockade convinced        numbers of the German working class that without  colonies the supply        of raw materials necessary for their industries was at  the mercy of other        Powers.5 8. It seems, however, to havs been rather  certain groups within the  party  than        the party as a whole, who were keen about colonies.

Unlike the  interest of  bourgeois circles, the  Social Democrat  interest in        colonies is  not determined so much by considerations  of &quot; Machtpolitik &quot;        as by the  need of raw materials.  If they could have  assurance as to        these  the German people would probably not care  much about colonies.        &quot;Vorwarts&quot; quoted.[j 12. Yet  according to Cunow no security  as to raw materials  is given  by the        League of  Nations, as defined by President Wilson.             GERMAN COLONIES AND POPULAR FEELING IN GERMANY.     5 1. It seemed  certain  till lately that a  great  effort  would be  made  by theGerman Government to obtain the return of their colonies as part of the conditionsof peace.   Since it now appears that the  Socialist element will be predominant in thenew Germany, it may be useful to enquire what amount  of popular support there hasbeen in  Germany for the views of the Colonial School.     If Dr.  Solf still had any influence upon the new Government we might expect thatprominence  would be given to the colonial question.   Solf s personal interest in  itmay be believed to be predominantly of the kind described as moral, imaginative, or
sentimental.   His early study of Indian languages shows  him to  have an  interest in non--European peoples, and he no doubt has  cherished  the conception,  to which  heclings, of a Germany which plays a great part in the world as a Power directing andeducating the backward races.  The example of England has stirred an emotion in himwhich can be variously regarded as  honorable emulation or restless envy.   His ownlife during the last  sixteen years has consisted in activities  directed to the realizationof these  ideals.   &quot; Kolonisieren heisst Missionieren &quot; (&quot;To colonise is  to  missionise &quot;)is the phrase in which he embodies his programme.     Even  if the reality of German  rule  over the backward races has been far fromcorresponding with  Dr.  Solf s good intentions, it remains true  that the  existence ofsuch  intentions in the  mind  of Dr.  Sblf, and no doubt of a  certain number of other-Germans, would cause the loss of the  colonies to be bitterly felt,  since the better partof their  nature  is thus enlisted upon the same  side as their national egoism.   How farwill the  protest of these circles be backed up in wide masses  of the people?     I 2.  A book published this year which has attracted some attention in  Germany,&quot; Das Ende des kolonialpolitischen Zeitalters &quot; by Dr. Karl Hoffman,  shows how thepublic interest  has  shifted from  one visionary scheme to  another according  to  thesituation of the hour.   In  the  course of 1915, Hoffmann  says,  whilst  the  german armies were thrusting back Russia and  the fight for the Dardanelles was going on,Mittel-Europa and Berlin to Bagdad were all the vogue and tended to divert interestfrom  the colonial empire.   Those were the  days when discussions  whether the &quot; chiefenemy&quot;  was  to be seen in the West  or  in the  East  were  rife.  In proportion as england came to be recognised as the chief enemy, interest veered again to the overseaempire from  the European Continent.   &quot; The  economic  questions  connected  withMittel-Europa had long begun to bore, and after the loss  of Bagdad Mesopotamia  was quite off and people  preferred to pretend that they had never had any great designs inthat direction.&quot;  The Mittel-Europa idea and  the Berlin to  Bagdad idea had still somehold upon the popular affection even at the  end  of  1917, but the colonial school  was working  against them.    &quot; After the catchwords &apos; Berlin to Bagdad&apos; and &apos; Mittel-Europa&apos; had, about the Easter of 1916,reached the summit of their journalistic effectiveness, in consequence of  the vogue  of  Naumann&apos;sbook during the preceding winter, the success of  our campaign in Serbia and Albania and  the cUbdcleof the Gallipoli adventure, a strong propaganda  for an &apos; active&apos; colonial policy and the restoration orthe creation of a larger German colonial empire set  in.  This propaganda lias gone on since more andmore  extensively.  The fundamental idea is practically the same throughout.  Our  position  (thisschool says) in the world market must be the expression of our economic strength.   But without a colonial economic activity that is impossible. Colonies have been shown to be the material basis forsuch a firm and secure position.  For this reason  we have  not only to resume  or carry forward  a colonial policy in  some  form or other (no one could prevent us doing that), but we must make sucha  policy  the main principle of our imperialist expansion.   Such  a principle must guide us in the deployment  of our policy  of power, because the vital interests of our economic policy  demand it.Our  political guiding idea can be nothing (we are told) but the construction  of a  large  colonial empire, a dominion with abundant coast lines  and deep  extensions  inland, with widely ramifyingnaval bases, in order to maintain our oversea connections, and with masses of oversea troops in orderto secure  this empire colonial power as a  reservoir of materials and men.  For an up-to-date nation.(&apos; ein modernes Volk&apos;) that wants to forge ahead this, they say, is the only possible foundation for itsstatus as  a world power &quot; (pp.  20, 21).     It is to be  noted that, this particular book&apos;s object is to prove that Mittel-Europa is,after all, the really  important thing  for Germany, and that to try to rest Germany&apos;power upon oversea possessions would be to  misread the signs  of the times, yet  thestatement quoted shows bow enthusiasm for any of these  schemes in Germany does not mean so much a fixed conviction as an avidity to grasp at whatever the situation of themoment seems to put within  reach.   The fact that to-day Mittel-Europa and berlin to Bagdad have obviously gone to smoke, whereas  there may seem to the Germans  afaintchance of  their recovering some colonial empire  by diplomatic intrigue  in  the peace negotiations, is likely to make them cling to this hope with greater intensity.      $ 3. The question is,  as has been said,  whether the demand to get back  colonies would have behind it a  great volume of popular  feeling.   As to this we have  certain noteworthy statements.   It is admitted, on the one hand, that  after the loss of the colonies the interest in them largely died  down in bourgeois circles in those circles,that is,  whose attachment  to them had been mainly  sentimental and Imaginative.          &quot; So far as it is possible to form a judgment at this stage, it would appear that      during  the war the idea of Germany  pursuing an  active  colonial policy  has not      gained many adherents.  At home one may now often hear  the  words, &apos; What is
     the good of colonies to Germany when they can so easily be taken  away in war ?     .....&apos;   Those ideas are becoming increasingly general.&quot;         (Johlinger in Bozi  and  Heinemanns  &quot; Ilecht, Verwaltung  uncl Politik im              Neuen Deutschland,&quot; published in 1916.)     This testimony is confirmed by Dr. Solf himself:          &quot; Political  circles which  before the  war gave wholehearted support to our     colonial policy now unhappily show diminished  interest  in  the rebuilding of our     oversea dominion, even if they do not actually try to relegate it, with a gesture of     annoyance, to the position of least importance amongst the things to be secured by     the war, as more or less of a side issue.&quot;         (Solf s introduction to Grabowsky&apos;s  &quot; Die Zukunft der deutschen Kolonien,&quot;              published at the end of 1917.)     According  to the report of a conversation  with  Branting at Stockholm in thesnraraer of 1917  secretly  communicated  by M.I.I 0 (Stockholm, August  1,  1917)Branting attributed to Eduard Bernstein the following description of the attitude of theGerman public, and Branting said  that the description was  &quot; supported  by practicallyeveryone I have met, who has been long in Germany lately &quot; :          &quot; The German  people as  a whole are not, and cannot be persuaded to be, very     much  interested in the question of colonies.   If they were to lose half their colonies     one day, they would hardly remember the fact the next so long as there was still     an &apos; Empire&apos; [i.e., a colonial empire of some  kind].    But if the ichole German     colonial empire were to be  lost, that would  be  another matter;  that  would be a     humiliation which could not be overlooked or forgotten.&quot;     I 4. The conclusion  to  be drawn from these statements would  seem to be that among the great mass of the German middle class the interest in the colonies had  fadedduring the war,  but that a certain sentimental  attachment to the idea of a  colonial empire still remained.  There is, however,  another  interesting development.   In thesame passage, quoted above, in which Dr.  Solf complained  that the  old friends  of a colonial policy had  grown cold, he  noted with satisfaction that the war &quot;had convertedthe great mass of the working-dass, which had hitherto regarded the colonial movementwith indifference or aversion, into its convinced friends.&quot;  It  is, of course,  difficult to getconfirmation of this statement as  far as the rank  and file  of  the working-class areconcerned, but it is quite plain that amongst the leaders of the Trade Unions and theSocial  Democrat Party, and in some of the principal party organs there has really beena remarkable change  of temper with regard to the German  colonies, a change  fromindifference or  aversion to the conviction that the interests of the working-class are bound up with the maintenance of a German  colonial  empire.     $ 5. It is well known that from the early clays of Germany&apos;s colonial activities theSocial Democrats took up a hostile attitude to the  movement.   They attacked  it on three grounds: (1) colonies were a disadvantage  rather than a  profit to the  Germanworking-class; (2)  on the  humanitarian ground  they  protested against the  crueltiesinflicted upon  the natives; (3) colonies served the purposes of an ambitious Weltpolitik.On the  20th January, 1885, Hasenclever, speaking in the Reichstag, said :          &quot;It is no question of getting lands for agriculture.....   All we can  do  is     to trade with the native populations, and- they stand very low as consumers.  I     only hope that these peoples may not be made  still poorer by our intervention     and the intervention  of civilised peoples generally.  In any case,  for long years to     come we  can look for no profit in the  matter of industry and trade.....  So     long as there  are still masses of people  here  in Germany whose  capacity as     consumers we  can  increase, and it is  our duty  to  increase, so long we ought     not to go flying off to the distant fields of Africa and New Guinea, and plunge     into politics out  there.&quot;     Hasenclever went  on to point out how much might  be  done  in Germany  byreclaiming  waste lands, improving  communications,  &amp;c.   Colonial  policy might bepositively  harmful in so far as it diverted attention from distress at home.   Thiswas the regular line taken by German Social  Democracy.   &quot; You get rid of the SocialQuestion,&quot;  cried the old  Wilhelm Liebknecht (1885)  &quot;by simply transporting  it
overseas.   You lie witch  the  eyes of the people with a  mirage  upon the sands  andswamps of Africa.&quot;     Secondly,  Social  Democrats  attacked  the  colonial   movement,  not   only  asunprofitable  and injurious to the German  working-class, but on humanitarian grounds,in the interest of the  native  races.  The utterances of German Social Democrats  onthis head are already fairly familiar, since they are one of the chief sources upon which british indictments of German rule draw.   In a book by a Social Democrat, GustavNoske, published in 1914 just before the outbreak of war, the damning witness borneby exponents of the colonial school against themselves is clearly brought forward :           &quot;In a book describing  his journey  through  German East  Africa  Peters     narrates with cynical frankness how he had negroes flogged, villages burnt down,     peaceful natives shot at, and exhausted black porters left  by the wayside to  be     eaten by lions&quot; (p.  43).     In  the  &quot; Kolonialpolitische Korrespondenz,&quot; the  organ  of the OstafrikanischeKompanie (year 1886, No. 3), we read :           &quot;The aim  of colonial policy is the most ruthless and determined enrichment     of our own people at the cost of other weaker peoples&quot; (p. 44).     A third reason for the opposition of the Social Democrats to a colonial policy wasits connection with an aggressive Machtpolitik.   As early as 1890. Noske says (p. 55),&quot; the principal value attached by Caprivi to the  possession of oversea  territories wasthat they held out the possibility of establishing coaling stations for the fleet.....&quot;     &quot; The principal reason for acquiring the Spanish (Caroline) Islands (in  1898) was the desire toget possession  of a number of  islands extending over a large tract of the Pacific, on which coalingstations might be established for the war fleet,  so that  Germany might have a decisive voice in  thesettlement of  large questions  of world policy in the time to come &quot; (pp. 82, 83).....&quot; This/&apos; saidWilhelni Liebknecht, &quot; is something quite different from a colonial policy of the genuine kind.  Thatis one of the reasons why my party fights on principle  against all  such plans  and endeavours.  the aims which are publicly put forward are not  the true  ones.  It is not in  order that we may havea  little bit more land,  it is to provide a basis for the disastrous naval policy,  the grandiose navalplans which arc still castles in the air &quot; (p. 84).     I 6. When, however, years went on and the German Empire  seemed to have anoversea empire in the tropics firmly attached to it, when  further  attempts were made from the bourgeois side  to make  German  methods  more consonant with humanity, inthe  reforms  connected with  the name  of  Dernburg, it  became more difficult  for  theGerman Social Democrat party to keep  up a purely negative attitude  to the  colonialquestion.     There arose a division of opinion in the party.   Some inclined to  the view that  thepresent system was not too bad to  be mended, that the party should direct its efforts tocorrecting abuses;  others contended that  oppression  and extermination of the nativeraces was inseparable from capitalistic colonial policy and  wished  the old&apos; negative attitude  to be maintained.  Jt was not till 1898 that any space was allotted to  the  dis-cussion of the  colonial  problem  at the  party congresses in  Germany.   The two views were thenceforth in conflict.      Speaking  on   the  1st  December,   1906, Bebel  declared that his  party was  notopposed to all colonial policy, but to colonial policy as it had hitherto been  carried on by Germany.     &quot; In certain circumstances colonial policy may be a work of culture.  There  is a great difference between colonial policy as it is and as it ought to be.   When the  representatives of civilised nations, such as those  of Europe and North America, come to strange peoples as  liberators and  educators, as helpers in their need, to convey to them the gains of civilisation, when the work is directed by these noble purposes and in the right way, we Social Democrats are the first to support such colonisation as a great cultural mission &quot; (Noske, p. 127).      The intransigeant section of the party got, in 1907, the support of a resolution on the colonial question passed at the International Socialist Congress held  that  year at Stuttgart, and passed against the  votes of all the German delegates.   Bebel sought to represent the cont  oversy as unpractical.   &quot; The question,&quot; he said,  &quot;whether  there  is such a thing as a Socialist colonial policy ought never to have been made a subject of discussion, because it is a &apos; strife about the Emperors beard.&apos; a matter of the millenium. What we, when we  have come to  power, shall do with our colonies, I tell you quite frankly, I have not the least idea.&quot;
     ^ 7.  For what followed after  1914 I translate from a recent article in a Social Democrat weekly:           &quot; Then came the war.   It hammered into our heads  the understanding that     national  States are  real fabrics which  no  philosophy of history can argue away.     ....  It radically changed our attitude to colonial policy.....The meaning  of     colonies  was driven home  upon us-I  mean especially upon the great famishing     masses of our people-by the economic catastrophe which the war and the English     blockade cruelly  brought  upon us.....The war delivered  a  most  personal     economic message to the humblest  citizen, of the State.   New lessons showered     upon us like sudden tropical  rain.  Our agi&apos;culture hangs  in  the  air, without     oversea connections without  fodder-stuffs,  without  manure.   Our  food in the     same way without rice, tropical  fats,  coffee, cocoa,  oil,  tobacco.  Our industry,     without  oversea connections, is  ruined-without cotton,  wool,  raw silk, jute -     without copper, iron ore, zinc ore, tin ore.  And these are only the more important     items amongst raw materials those by working up which not only our industrial     magnates live, but our workers two millions in the metal industry, more than a     million in the textile industry,  250,000  in the  chemical industry, 200,000 in the     docks and wharves, 34(5,000 members of families in the tobacco  industry.   We must     therefore have territories yielding raw materials to  guarantee us  an unimpeded     supply, and also markets which can take our manufactures and so secure a regular     course for our industrial production.....Recognition of the fact that Germany-     not the  poor agrarian Junker Prussia  of the middle of  the 19th  century, but     the new opulent country of fine-quality wares and world-trade that this Germany     is  utterly  destroyed unless it has  assured connections with  foreign  lands for     import and export became, through  the  war  which  threv/ us back into our     Central-European fortress, the common property of all the thoughtful working-class.          &quot; But  tins entailel  straight  away the  necessity of  a  largely  conceived     colonial policy.   For what  is meant now and after the war by  &apos; assured supply,     &apos; an assured market&apos; ?  The epoch of free trade and the open door is apparently     over for good.   In the  markets  of   the  enemy  countries China,  Australia,     India,  Brazil we  depend  entirely  upon   the  good-will  of  our opponents.     The  few neutral  markets   have   for  the   most  part  been lost to  us in the     course of four years.  England is bestirring herself to fence in her Empire with a     high tariff  wall......The Entente Powers mean to continue the blockade  of     Germany even when the war is over to hinder the purchase of its  products, to     bar the delivery of raw materials in order  to draw into their own  countries the     flourishing  German industries.  Even if  the plans  of  the Paris Economic Confer-     ence do not come off, no one will be able to compel the Entente Powers to  furnish     or  purchase goods in sufficient quantities to save our country from an  existence     which  would be  vegetation rather, than life.....It  would  be  too much to     affirm that  this train of thought has as yet been articulately  apprehended by the     rank and  file  of German  workers.   But the fact that it  is the  working-class     which lias accomplished the new orientation in  economic matters more radically     than any, other that is indisputable.   Here its schooling in Marxian  doctrines     was a help  to it.....No section of the German people has made such persistent     propaganda for the most important German  war-aim the recovery of an assured     supply of raw materials and assured markets as the Social Democrat party.  . .  . .     The German working-class would willingly abandon Lithuania to the Russians  if     we could gain  a  secure position  in  Africa by, the peace.  The fact  that the     restoration  of our economic position in the world is far more  important than any     war-aims on the European Continent-this through all the course of the war we     have never  grown weary of  reiterating.   There  were moments  of flushed confidence     when we stood almost alone in our propaganda for  these unambitious  economic     aims.  Whilst the German bourgeoise hunted  Pan-German dreams in France and     Russia, Social Democrat writers continued to underline in the  most emphatic way     the necessity of oversea colonies.....And to-day,  when America&apos;s effective     entry into the war has sobered  the intoxicated  of yesterday, colonies have  once     again become the common war aim of the whole German people.&quot;         (Dr.  Adolf  Koster in &quot;Die Glocke&quot; for September, 21, 1918.)     I 8. So far the Social Democratic writer, and it  will be observed that his statementbears out what had been gathered from other sources the fact that the support of thecolonial idea in these last four years has come rather from  Labour,  than from bourgeois
circles, the temporary eclipse of the colonial idea in bourgeois  circles by  Pan-Germancontinental ambitions and Mittel-Europa in 1916 and 1917, the revival of interest in thecolonies when continental hopes faded.     Whilst however it would seem to be true that the chief support of the colonial ideahas lately come from Labour circles, it, would probably not be true to affirm the conversethat Labour circles as a whole have been keenly interested in  the  colonial idea.   It is significant that  Dr. Kdster, himself a Social Democrat colonial enthusiast, admits  thatthe argument he puts forward has perhaps  not been  articulately apprehended by  the mass of the workers.  It is certain groups of the Labour leaders who have taken up thecolonial  idea  ardently  and  made  propaganda for it the  groups often  described as&quot; Imperialist Socialists&quot; whose organs are the fortnightly&quot; Sozialistische Monatshefte &quot;and  the  weekly &quot; Die Glocke.&quot;     The &quot; Sozialistische  Monatshefte  &quot; had even before the war adopted the belief thatan active colonial policy was required  by the interests of the German working-class.  Ithas  during the war  made a  speciality of preaching this  creed.  Its  two principalexponents are the economist Max  Schippel  and Dr. Ludwig Quessel, who is  a SocialDemocrat member of  the  Reichstag.  In an  article  published  in the  number ofthe  &quot; Sozialistische Monatshefte&quot; for 25th  June,  entitled   &quot; Halbheit  oder ganzeKolonialpolitik ?&quot;  Schippel  urged  that all  pretence of applying  the principal &quot; Noannexations&quot; to colonial territory should be thrown over, since, in order to be economicallyindependent, Germany required a substantial  addition to her  former  colonial  empire.In the same article Schippel explained that  the reason why Germany needed to possesscountries supplying raw  materials  was not only that she might  draw directly from them the materials needed for her own industries, but that, by controlling to a greater orlarger extent the supply  of certain raw  materials generally  needed, she might have astrong means of economic pressure upon other countries, and compel them to concedeher at fair terms the  raw materials of which they controlled the  supply by refusingotherwise to satisfy their  needs  in the matter of the materials of  which she had  thecontrol.     The attitude of the bulk of the party seems to have wavered between the old suspicion of colonial imperialism and the championship of a colonial policy characteristic of  theRight Wing.  In August, 1915, when the party officially drew up  a statement of thewar aims for which it stood, it included  &quot; no cession of German  territory.&quot;   This was apparently understood to include colonial territory.   At any  rate,  two years later inthe Stockholm memorandum of the German Majority Socialists, it is explained expresslythat &quot; the rejection of forced  annexations  clearly implies the restoration of colonies which have been taken.&quot;   It was this attitude of asking for  the old colonies back  butasking for no more which provoked the scorn  of Max Schippel,  in the  article abovecited, as a &quot; Halbheit.&quot;   Even, however, if it wanted  the colonies back, the party,  asdistinguished from the Right Wing, seems  to have fought rather shy of the subject.The official daily organ of the party, &quot; Vorwarts,&quot; even after it passed under the controlof the Majority in October, 1916,  left  the subject of the colonies alone.   In the summer of 1916, when a big meeting was  held at which members of the various political partiesspoke in favour of a forward colonial policy, and Paul Lensch, one of the  collaboratorsin &quot; Die Glocke,&quot; spoke as a Social Democrat), the party Directorate had felt bound toissue afterwards  a public statement  that it accepted no responsibility  for Lensch&apos;sutterances.    jj 9.  During 1917 the colonial idea seems  to  have gained ground in the  party.Gustav Noske, who had written just before the war the book on  the colonial question referred-to above, in which  he gave  frank  prominence  to  abuses  and  scandals  and certainly displayed no enthusiasm for  colonies, said in  June, 1917, in the Reichstag that&quot; it went without saying &quot; that Germany must have a colonial empire.   Speaking in theReichstag on May 14, 1918, Noske said : &quot; I will only say that in the opinion of theSocial Democrat party, behind which stands the mass  of German workers, the enemymust reckon on the restoration of the colonial possessions of Germany.&quot;   When  theparty authorities in the October of 1917 ejected Kautsky from the editorship  of the weekly, &quot; Die Neue Zeit,&quot; which is the recognised  intellectual organ of the party, theyput in Heinrich Cunow as editor.   &quot; Die Neue Zeit&quot; must be regarded as representingthe mind of the party in  a way which  the organs of the Right Wing can hardly claim todo.   As lately as September 13, 1918, the  paper published  an article of Gunow&apos;s, inwhich he wrote:         &quot; If Germany wants to maintain in the coming era of financial capitalism  and    Anglo-American  coalition the economic  position  in the world, which she  has
      attained  in these last decades,  she must extend her colonial territories further.      The acquisitions which in the first  instance present themselves are the remains of      the once gigantic world-embracing  Portuguese empire, which Portugal to-day does      not know what to do with.....  It is quite beyond  doubt that if Germany does      not  acquire  these  territories, they  will  be  appropriated within a few years by      England, either as a repayment for part of the sums lent by England to Portugal,      or  in  the &quot; humane &quot; manner in which  England possessed herself of the  Boer      States.  In the sphere of colonial policy as in others, the world war has brought      about a complete revolution.   The old formulas, arguments, and counter-arguments,      which once played their part  in  discussions  of the  &quot; colonial question,&quot; have lost      their meaning.  The sliiftings which are  taking place in the  economic system of      the world give rise to  new considerations.  Many  old  objections which  before the      war had a certain ground in  view of the economic evolution of Germany at  that      time, the rapid expansion of her foreign  trade even in British colonial territories,      England&apos;s system of free trade, the open door  in colonial markets, &amp;c, have lost all      ground now  that   Germany&apos;s vital  economic  requirements  and international      connections have become  quite different.  The  new world situation compels the      German working-class, if it is not to neglect  its own  interests, to take  up quite  a      different attitude  to the  colonial question.  The  German working-class can only      hope to improve its position further if Germany&apos;s economic  activity continues  to      develop unhampered.&quot;      $ f 0. It is to be observed that the Minority Social Democrats or as they should now be called, the  &quot;Independent  Social Democrat Party&quot; have  adhered  to the old attitude of opposition.   They continue  to maintain that the desire  to  have oversea colonies is reprehensible imperialism, and that their possession is rather a disadvantage to the  proletariat  than  an  advantage.&apos;^  Yet they  have not  perhaps been   quite unaffected  by the  growth of the  colonial  movement in the Social  Democrat  Party generally.  The official expression of their views is the Minority memorandum issued at Stockholm in the summer of 1917.  In this they affirm once more that Germany cannot ask to have her colonies back on any ground of justice.  Nor, they  say,  can Germany ask for them back  on the ground that  they are necessary to  economic  development. Yet, they opine, it  would be a matter  of political sagacity (&quot; Klugheit&quot;) on the part of Germany&apos;s enemies, if they did not  insist  upon  peace  conditions which would  give occasion to new wars.   What was meant by this is indicated in the words of Bernstein reported above-that to take away the whole of Germany&apos;s  colonial  empire might  leave a dangerous feeling of resentment.     ^ 11. The  demand  for colonies, we have  seen, which has grown weaker in  bour- geois circles has grown stronger in Labour  circles.  But it is to be observed that the demand, as raised  by Labour leaders to-clay,  is of a different quality  from the old- bourgeois demand.   In  the  old  demand, as  it is  still urged  from  those bourgeois circles, who continue faithful to  the colonial  school,  colonies  are  chiefly valuable as flattering German pride and contributing  to German  world-power.   They put forward indeed also the economic  argument e.g.,  Emil  Zimmermann  in &quot; Das deutsche Kaiser- reich Mittelafrika &quot; but the economic independence of the Anglo-Saxons  desired for Germany is represented as  being, before all else, a means to  German world-power.   The Social Democrats, on the  other hand, are  not thinking so  much about world-power as about the material needs of the  German  working-class.  They desire colonies in order that the German working-class may not be  reduced to poverty by having its supply o raw materials cut oft.   This is an important difference, because it suggestsa possibility that if they could  obtain assurance that,  apart from colonies, the German people could have its fair supply of raw  materials guaranteed to it, their  interest in colonies would largely fade.  And  this  possibility is actually indicated  as likely by recent utterances in the Majority Social Democrat press with regard to the adumbrated League  of Nations.          &quot; Wars have hitherto been fought for  territory.  But in the ideal condition of     things constituted by an assured  fellowship of States one can  easily imagine one     State ready to cede  a, tract of territory to another State and that other State not     caring to take it over.....What meaning  has &apos; Machtpplitik&apos; any  more when     all  lands  are,  so to speak,  open to all ;  when  I can procure cotton, copper,     petroleum just as well from foreign countries as from my own ; when I  can find as    * &quot; We will have nothing-  to do with these fantastic  schemes.  We absolutely repudiate the capitalist colonial policy, and we regard  these colonial plans as the real cause of the war.  The people support us. Unfortunately, colonial policy is supported by a section of  Socialism which has been perverted  into the paths of Imperialism.&quot;-Henke, in the lieichstag, May 14, 1918.
     free a market for my yarn, nails and machines abroad as at  home  and no danger     of war any longer disturbs  these  assured  economic  relations?   And  that  is the     main import of Wilsoifs programme.&quot;         (&quot; Vorwarts &quot; for October 7, 1918.)         &quot; If the distribution of raw materials is  regulated  in a satisfactory way, the     question whether this or the other producing country is under the  direct control     of some particular State ceases to  be a vital one for that State.&quot;         (&quot; Vorwarts &quot; for September 22.)     $ 12. On the other hand, Cunow, in the &quot; Neue Zeit  &quot; for the 25th October, warnshis fellow Social  Democrats against taking it for granted  that a League of Nationsmeans free access to the tropical countries:          &quot; The colonial question will doubtless figure prominently in the peace negotia-     tions.  Ought Germany to renounce her colonial possessions ?   Wilson&apos;s basis for     negotiations  does not say so ;  but to infer from this that such a  demand will not     be raised at the  Conference  table would be fallacious.   Wilsons fourteen  points     generally need only a  little skilful interpretation  in  order to afford the Entente     States a ground for all conceivable claims, amongst them the demand that Germany     shall renounce  her  colonies.    All  the  campaign   now  being  carried on by     Lloyd George&apos;s Government against supposed German atrocities in  the colonies  is     nothing else but a preparation for bringing  forward  the argument comprised in     Wilson&apos;s programme as a reason&apos; for. England&apos;s refusing to give back the occupied     German colonies.  Point 5 of  Wilson&apos;s basis states that a &apos; free, open-minded and     absolutely impartial adjustment&apos; of all colonial claims is to be based upon the strict     observance of the principle &apos; that in determining all such questions of sovereignty     the  interests of the  populations concerned must have equal weight  with the     equitable  claims of the  Government, &amp;c.&apos;   If,  therefore, it were  possible to     demonstrate that the interests of the natives  would be injured by the return of the     German colonies to the German Empire, the claim  of the German  Empire would be     invalidated.   It is in order to  provide  this demonstration that the  English  have    got up the theatrical storm of indignation  against the  supposed  misusage of the    native population in the German colonies.   England, as was shown  in  Heft  24 of    the last volume of &quot; Die Neue Zeit,&quot; wants to get hold of the  German colonies in    Africa in order to carry out her great African schemes, and secure her dominion in    India.  For this reason she  is trying to  adapt  herself cunningly  to  Wilson&apos;s    attitude,  and so  furnish the proof which he requires.         &quot; Optimistic idealists  may possibly  console  themselves  for the  loss of the    colonies by  the  thought that Wilson&apos;s programme  after all also  demands the    establishment of a League  of  Nations, which so they imagine would guarantee    complete freedom of  navigation, equal rights  for everybody in trade, security for    the supply of raw materials, and even  the  realisation of free trade according  to    the recipe of  Cobden of blessed memory.  Unfortunately they omit to notice that    Wilson nowhere assigns these  tasks to  the League of  Nations which he wants set    up ;  its function is to be just the protection of nations,  great and  small, against    hostile attack and breaches of  the  peace.  Anybody with the least knowledge of    American  policy in trade and fiscal matters can only wonder at  the  naivete which    supposes that Wilson has any idea of assigning to his  League of Nations  tasks    which  would  mean  the complete reversal of the trade policy  pursued by the    United States for decades past!  True, in his Point  2 Wilson demands &apos; absolute    freedom of  navigation upon  the seas,&apos;  but only   on  the  open  seas, not  in    so-called   &apos; territorial  waters&apos;   nor  in  those  seas which have  been  closed by    an international agreement.   There is nothing which indicates equal rights in the    use of  the Panama Canal, or its internationalisation.   Still less is there  any talk    of introducing free trade in the States  forming the league.  All that Point 3 asks    for  is  the removal  of economic  barriers, &apos;  so  far as  possible&apos; a very elastic    conception! and further &apos; the establishment of an  equality of  trade conditions    amongst  all  the nations  consenting  to  the peace.&apos;    That means,  the Powers    concluding the peace must not make  accessory compacts to  concede  each  other    special mutual advantages for instance, try to exclude  a particular country from    commercial intercourse  by  a  preferential  tariff.   But  there  is  nothing in this    demand which implies that each of the countries concerned must adopt free trade,
     nothing to  prevent a  country  concluding  preferential  treaties with its own     colonies.   The  endeavours of the British  Imperialists  to  bring about&apos; Imperial     Federation,&apos;  as it is called,  an  imperial  customs  union embracing  the mother     country and  its colonies, are quite unaffected.&quot;     It will  be  plain what the fear is which makes so many representatives of GermanLabour to-day regard the loss of the colonies as meaning  economic misery at home.  Ifthe new arrangement of the  world be so devised that this fear is removed, it  seemsquestionable whether the German working-class will continue to feel any strong interestin the possession of oversea dominions.   On the  other hand,  if the  new Germanysucceeds in settling its domestic problems and becomes  a  vigorous state  conducted  ondemocratic or socialist principles, it might come  in  future  to  feel its dignity injuredshould it be permanently excluded  from all share in the work of civilising the backwardparts of the earth.
