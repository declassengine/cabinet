I DOCUMENT  lo THE  PROPERTY OF  KTS  EPITAMNIQ  MAJFSTY&apos;   government-iRIMNT,RET,MEDICAL EXAMINATION,&quot;ON DEMOBILISATION, OF MEN52.SERVING IN ri&apos;IIE ARMY,MEMORANDUM M THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL             SERVICE.      In my dual capacity as the-:Director  General of NationalService and president of the Local Government Board, I desire tocall the attention of the War cabinet, as a matter of extreme urgency, to the procedure adopted for the medical examination ofmen released from the Colours on general demobilisation.      It Is an obvious necessity that there should be on recordcomplete and trustworthy particulars of the physical condition ofevery man on his discharge from the Armed Forces.of the Crown.If no&quot;rra.Jh record is available both the State and the demobilisedsoldier are likely to suffer hereafter, and It seems to me that ifthis information is to be unimpeachable, it should take the formof the finding of a Medical Board.      Under the procedure to be followed on demobilisation all officers and men (except those in Hospital or on leave therefrom)will be given the opportunity of filling in a form  (A.F.Z. 22).This form enables a claim to be made on account of disability dueto Military Service, in which case the applicant answers a number of questions and is medically examined by the Medical Officer.of hisUnit    If he makes no such claim 1 he signs a statement to that effect in a space provided on the form which is witnessed by an Officer ofhis Unit and receives no medical examination.      This system not only involves a departure from the establishedprinciple, which has gained the confidence of the Public, thatmedical examination should be conducted by a properly constitutedMedical Board;  it also means that in a very large number of cases in which a man makes no immediate claim, the medical authority whichwill in future be charged with the Assessment of Pensions, who at best will have an increasingly difficult task to perform) will haveno information before them with regard to the man^s physicalcondition on demobilisation.   The result will be that the state may be called upon to bear an unfair burden if such men are grantedpensions, and, if they are not, there is certain to be a publicoutcry against the system which did not make proper provision fortheir medical examination before they left the Service.28.XI.18,                               A.C.
