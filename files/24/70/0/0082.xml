WAR   CABINET..                      ^                 I1PRI30NMENT  OP JOHN  MACLEAN *Note by Mr.O.H.Barnes            The continued agitation about John Maclean constituencies&quot;-  -utes a serious danger for the Government.      Mass meetings  have been held in many places, including London, and resolu-  tions continue to be poured in demanding his release.,            I think that no good purpose is being served by  keeping him in prison, and that a favourable opportunity pre-  sents itself for his release.     I should not take any notice  of the agitation, but release him as a matter of amnesty in  consequence of the signing of the armistice.    I note that  there is to be a meeting in the Albert Hall next Saturday,  convened by Lansbury and those with whom he Is associated,  and I have little doubt but that John Maclean will bulk very  largely in the speeches.    That will no doubt be followed  by Hiany similar meetings during the next two or three weeks,*  with, I think, bad results on the public mind.            Mr.Munro has been averse to releasing him, and I  think has been very badly treated by those who have spread  false reports about prison treatment.   Mr.Mtt.nro, however,  has said that he would be quite willing to release Maclean  if it was a matter of a general amnesty.    But the position  is that in England and Wales there are no political prisoners  convicted, as,Maclean is, under D.O.R.A.      There are only  two in Scotland; the other one being a tram conductor named  Milne, who has served about forty out of a sentence of sixty  days.            I think it would be an act of grace therefore, to  release both of them before the agitation assumes larger end  more dangerous dimensions.(Initialled)   G.N.B.2, Whitehall Gardens, S-.W.     26th November 1918.
