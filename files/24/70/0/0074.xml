Nor would  it be sufficientto select representatives from one or two Dominions to attend the Conference, as in that case the other Dominions will not bedireotly  represented or consulted, and may possibly have a grievance on that score.     The  fair and proper way seems to ms to take all theDominicn Prime Ministers to tho place where the Conference isLa,.   so  that the&apos;British Prime Minister could consult them atsittings  of the Imperial Cabinet on all the principal questions as they actually arise at the Conference.  In addition theywould form a paaiol from which delegates could be drawn for particular purposes.   Thus a Dominion Prime  Minister should attend the Conference as a Member of the British delegationwhenever  the interests of his Dominion are affected by thomatters under discussion.     It seems to me that representation of the Dominions onthbwe lines is not only feasible but fair, and no grievancecould hereafter bo urged by any Dominion that it had not been consulted in reference to important provisions of the peace treaty,                            (Intduj JoCS.2, Whitehall Gardens, So17*
