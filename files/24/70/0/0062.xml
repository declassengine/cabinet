SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION.

Nov. 15 - 21, 1918.

1. BLOCKADE. H.M. Representative in Neutral countries have been instructed to inform the Governments to which they are accredited that the Channel route will shortly be available for Neutral shipping. The clauses in various charters and in Agreements with Neutral Associations which require Neutral ships to take the Northabout route will accordingly be waived. Arrangements have been made for the inspection of cargoes at Falmouth. 

2. RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR ENEMY COUNTRIES. The Italian Government have adopted the suggestion that an immediate use should be made of the Austro-Hungarian Mercantile Fleet for provisioning enemy territories. They have already begun to requisition Austrian merchantmen at Sebenico and elsewhere. The United States Government propose that the Central Powers should as far as possible be fed from the adjacent neutral countries in order that tonnage may be saved. They suggest in particular that we should now permit Denmark to send to Germany the Whole of the Danish surplus production of butter thus relieving H.M. Government of the burden of further purchases. The United States Government suggest that, as a general rule, existing blockade conditions should be maintained, but that our various Agreements with Neutral Governments and Associations should henceforth be more leniently interpreted. H.M. Government still propose to maintain a strict control over all transactions likely to hamper the various Allied Purchasing Committees in their work of controlling prices and securing an equitable distribution, and no facilities will be allowed for private and individual purchases for enemy account. The censership authorities have been instructed to watch carefully the following transactions :-

E.U. Consul General  at Helsingfors    recommends that we should definitely promise  Finland  at  least    100,000 tons  of cereals.    For military  purposes  alonqfrinland    requires at least  10,000  tons.    Sho Finnish  Government  havo    discussed this question with tho  Swedish Minister for Foreign    Affairs v/ho has informed  our Minister at  Stockholm that  Sweden    is  prepared to supply Finland with  limited quantities of cereals    if  the  ALLIED Governments will guarantee  to replace them later    on.   She  Finnish  Government  are  prepared to welcome  and co-    operate with  any Allied forces which may bo sent  to oppose tho    Bolsheviks either  in Finland  or in  Petrograd.15.  DBflMARK.   The  German Authorities have suspended  the  export of    ooal to Denmark.    he Danish Government ask if there  is any    prospeot  of an increased  supply of  ooal for Denmark from the    United  Kingdom at  cheaper rates.B6.  NBMiJUgDB.    The draft  of  a general Agreement between Holland    and  tho Associated Governments has  been  approved  in London and    a Fishing Agreement has also  been arranged.   M.  Golyn has signed v,    tho  draft  and has  left M. Haldring  to settle any  further details^     he  Allied representatives in London are withholding their
 signatures until Mr. Sheldon has received Instructions to sign from the War 1&apos;rado Board.   Tho Unitod States Government have reserved the right to examine tho general Agreement in detail before ratifying tho terms.  M. Colyn will inform tho Dutch Government, that provided, the restrictions imposed by tho Agreement upon Dutoh exports to Germany are confirmed, the AejBoqiatea  Governments will facilitate tho immediate Bailing of Dutch vessels overseas to fetch cargoea for Holland consigned to the  1.0.1&apos;.  within the rations.    Tho United  State a Government con- cur in  these  arrangements provided  the cargoes  In question are purchased in  the United atatos.   They prefer that Holland should. obtain  foodstuffs from tho United state  as  being the  nearest point of  supply.      The  Gorman  Authorities  have notified  the patch  Govorn- ment  that, for tho moment, they are  unable to send to  Holland  any further supplies  of coal,  pitch, salt  on, iron.    The Dutch Gov- ornmant accordingly ask whether H.M. Government eon assist Holland with those commodities.   We have offered to sand within the next month 60i000 tons of coal  of specified  qualities and 10,000 tons of  pitch.   We stipulate that the Dutch exports to Germany sanctioi- ed  by the Agreement drafted this week  in London shall not take place so long as the Gorman Government are unable to supply Hollandwith commodities in compensations     She German Authorities have abolished the list of Dutchfirms which may not receive German goods or Gorman coal.    So declarations will henceforth be required from Dutch traders who assire to obtain goods from Gomany, and goods will henceforth be freely delivered provided the German regulations as to export licences and export prohibitions are observed.
