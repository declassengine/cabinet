Offioe of works,    WESTMINSTER,          &apos; S.W.1. 19th November,  1918.I.2y dear prime Kinioter,               Some time ago Lord Crawford who was  Chairmanof the Cabinet Committee appointed to deal with the  soheme forthe Imperial War huaeum asked for the Report  of the  Committeetc be submitted to the War Cabinet,   Unfortunately, up  to-nowjno time has &quot;been found for this,  -I know the  pressure  of work must be very great, and have therefore been reluctant  to press this matter on your attention.   A stage.has  nov been  reaohed,however, when,some deoision must be taken,  The time now is a very critical ;o&apos;ne for obtaining a great  deal of thematerial for the huseum,. Sand I find we are continuallyhampered in not being able to say that the Cabinet  have  decidedhow the scheme is to go forward, and -&quot;here the Museum  is tobe placed..   Valuable gifts of priceless interest would  cometo us as soon as we oould state that the huseum is  about tobecome a reality,   It would also-give emergency work whichmight be useful in viev, cf possible unemployment.      Thereport of the Committee is all settled, and I think  it wouldnot really occupy much time for the Cabinet to consider,  it,I therefore trust you will direct Sir maurice Kankey to  put it on the Agenda at an early date.                  Yours sincerely.,                         ( Sd.)  ALFRED aQi\L\The. Rt. Hon, D. Lloyd George, ]  .P.,     10, Downing Street,               S,W.L.
