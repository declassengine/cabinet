MINISTKY   OF   FOOD.   Report for  Week ending  Wednesday, November 20,  1918.                        PART I-ACTION  TAKEN.    Relaxation of  Control. It  was stated  in the House of  Commons  to-day,  in answer to a question by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, that the powers and duties  of theFood Controller are limited by statute to the expiration of one year after the termina-tion of the war or  to such earlier date as may be fixed by Order in Council.   Noarrangement could  accordingly l)e made,  under these  powers, for any permanentcontrol of food. The question whether any part of the control established during thewar could usefully be continued during peace  was being considered.  Meanwhile thefood position  was  not such  as  to  render  any immediate relaxation  of  controlpossible.    At the meeting of the Consumers&apos; Council on 20th November, on the  motion  ofMr. Hyndman, a committee was appointed :             &quot; To consider the measures taken by the Ministry of  Food for the control      of prices and distribution of food, and  for  other  purposes  during the war      period,  and to advise whether any, and, if any, which of these measures should      be continued in peace time.&quot;    Owing to  the allocation of increased tonnage, the stocks of tea now in the country are very much larger than it was anticipated  would be the case.  The  decision hasconsequently been taken     (a)  to relax the present restrictions on the quantities of tea which may be obtained           by traders, caterers,  &amp;c, and be disposed of by retailers to their registered           customers;  and    (b)  to  suspend further action with regard  to the introduction of the stricter           scheme of distribution which it had been intended to bring into operation           as  from 25th January.    The Food Controller  has  decided that the following concessions with regard tothe meat ration may he made for the coming Christmas season :     (1)  Turkeys,  ducks,  geese,  fowls, chickens, and game are  free  of  the  coupon,           whether bought from a retailer  or,  in the form of a meat  meal,  at a           catering establishment,  from  Monday  16th  December to Saturday 4th           January.    (2)  Butcher&apos;s Meat. The value of the meat  coupon  is doubled, in England and           Wales, for  the week preceding   Christmas  (which  gives  the  coupons           numbered 7 in the  current ration book  double value during the 10  days           of  their currency), and  in Scotland  for  the following week (which gives           the coupons numbered 8 the double value).   This  concession also  applies           to both retailers and caterers ;  the classes of meat included are beef,  veal,           mutton, lamb, pork, suet, loose fat, tongues, kidneys, and ox-skirt.    With the concurrence of the Food Controller, the Royal Commission on the SugarSupply proposes to make additional Christmas tide issues of  sugar to children undersix years, to persons resident in hospitals, workhouses, &amp;c, to Local Food committees in connection  with local festivities, and  to  manufacturers of  sugar confectionery,pastries, biscuits,  &amp;c.    The Imports  Board have considered the relaxation of import restrictions on food-stuffs.  The Board of Trade have issued a  preliminary list  of prohibited articles forwhich it is proposed  to  issue  general licences for three  months, and this  listincludes :            Aerated  mineral and table waters (unsweetened);  almonds  and nuts ;      cocoa (raw); apples; bananas;  bladders, casings  and sausage skins, calves      vels and rennet; salt.    A further  list of articles for which, general licences will be  issued is under con-sideration.  Cable instructions have been sent to both the United  States  and Canada    A (33)6822-3 Pk 1 140 11/18  E &amp; S                                         A.
o  ship apples freely  on private  account at commercial rates.  Freight rates  havealien from 21. 10s. to 11. per barrel.     The Food Council. Sir John Beale reported that  the Ministry of Shipping were able to arrange freight for the importation of Canadian apples the speedy supply anddistribution  of  which  is very desirable.   It was decided to  instruct  the  FruitSupplies Branch to  purchase and  import up to 20,000 tons on  direct account of theMinistry of  Food, this direct purchase to be distributed on arrival  through ordinarytrade channels and  to be additional  to and not instead of the importation already sanctioned on private account.   An Order fixing maximum prices is  to be issued.     The Food Controller has decided not to appoint Mr.  Reginald Butler as Directorof the Milk Clearing House,  but he is to be asked to serve on the  Milk Board togetherwith a representative of the  Agricultural Organisation  Society and a representative ofthe wholesale trade not connected with the United Dairies, Ltd.     It was reported that the India  Office had  agreed to the purchase of the export-able surplus of. the whole  range  of oilseeds in  India, and it was  decided that theOilseeds Executive should proceed to purchase.     The  Financial  Secretary  lias  been  authorised  to  proceed  with the  financial arrangements relative to the provision of hotel accommodation for the British delegates.to the Peace Conference.     Home Supplies Board. The  operation  of  the  Feeding Stuffs  Scheme and theeffect of  the anticipated increase in  the amount  of offals available  to  40,000 tons aweek was reviewed.  It was agreed that, subject to further consideration of estimatedresults to be worked out  by the Feeding Stuffs Board, it  appeared to be advisable  toissue an  Order that all licences for  purchase of offals  should be treated  as prioritycertificates, leaving the miller free  to sell any surplus he may have after meeting thedemands of the ration.     Central  Agricultural  Advisory  Council. At a  meeting  of  the  Council  onNovember J 9th, it  was agreed that only  fat stock  markets  in selected districtssuffering hardship should be  re-opened  rather  than  all the markets in  one  area.Several members  expressed( the opinion  that  the congestion in  the grass districtswould be completely relieved within a fortnight, and that great credit  was due tothe Ministry of Food for its  prompt  action  in dealing with surplus supplies of fatcattle.     An announcement as to the measures taken for dealing with the surplus suppliesof pigs was made ; the buying  permits issued in any live stock area have been madeavailable also in adjacent  areas, thus permitting four or five times as many buyers toenter a market as under the  former regulations ; the &quot; per head &quot; charge  on all pigsover 170 lbs. live weight has  been reduced by  25s. and by corresponding smalleramounts  on pigs  of less weight.   It is  hoped that these measures will meet thesituation without any alteration in the Pig Sales Order.     The following motion was carried :            &quot; The Central Agricultural Advisory Council desires  to call the attention       of the  War Office to the grave  danger attending  the repatriation of Army       horses from France, owing to the prevalence of a malignant form of ophthalmia       and other infectious  diseases  in a more or less epidemic  form amongst these       horses.  It is hoped that special care will  be taken to safeguard the interests       of horse owners and live stock  breeders in the United Kingdom in. reference to       this matter.&quot;     Labour Conference. The  Seventh Labour Conference  was held  at  GrosvenorHouse on Saturday, 16th instant.  There was a large  attendance, over 200 delegatesattending from  the  various Labour,  Trade Union, and Co-operative  Organisations inLondon.     The chief question before  the  Conference was the present position of the milksupply in  the country.  Great feeling was expressed  both  as to the question of distribution and the price  of  milk.   Mr. H. N. Hyndman, who attended, urged  a subsidy so that milk might be brought within the reach of all people earning under31. per week, and the Conference  clearly expressed the view  that  priority schemes were useless so long as the price was so high that it was beyond  the reach of familieswho could not afford to  buy it.  A resolution was proposed and  carried  practicallyunanimously, that a subsidy should  be made, so that the  price of milk  should bereduced to 6d. per quart, which would enable a priority scheme to become practicable and would achieve a fairer distribution.
     The constitution of the new Food Control Committees came under [consideration. After considerable discussion the Conference passed the following resolution :             &quot; That this  Conference expresses  its appreciation with  the  substantial       increase  of Labour Representation on  the newly  appointed Food Control       Committees insisted upon in  the new Order of the Ministry, and  trusts the       Local Authorities will loyally carry out the  instructions  contained, in  such       Order.&quot;                            SUPPLIES AND  DISTRIBUTION.     Bacon. It is proposed that,  until tho  position-becomes clearer, there  should  be no relaxation of the present rules, but that the existing channels, both of supply and distribution, should be maintained.     During the past week the civilian consumption of bacon fell off, but it is expected to increase considerably from  now onwards,  as  more popular cuts  are  being distributed.     A good supply of hams has been  allotted  by  the Ministry among the trade, in order to  meet the Christmas demand.     A considerable amount of imported bacon has been sent from the United Kingdom to France and Belgium to help  feed the  liberated districts.   This amount will be subsequently replaced by France and Belgium.     The lard supplies and stocks are ample for the  civil requirements.       &apos; ,     Cereals. The  Grain (Prices)  Amendment  Order, 1918,  dated  14th  November 191.8,  increases  the maximum price for barley by 3s. per quarter, when the sale is made to  a licensed manufacturer buying for manufacture, or to a recognised  dealer buying for resale  to a  licensed  manufacturer.  Until 1st January 1919, barley may not be sold for seed at a  price exceeding the maximum price under the Grain (Prices) Order.     Cocoa. Cocoa has been removed from the list of prohibitive imports for a period of three  months.  In addition the  Board of  Trade  will allow,  during  1919, the importation of raw cocoa from all countries up to 100 per  cent, of their imports in 1916.     At a  meeting of the Cocoa Advisory Committee held on Tuesday,  the  19th November, it was unanimously decided by the  members of the Committee that the relaxation of cocoa control would be extremely unwise at the present time.     Coffee. The coffees of average quality have dropped in price some 10s. or 15s. per cwt. This lowering of prices is due to an understanding arrived at between the trade and the Ministry at the last Coffee Advisory Committee meeting, when the  buying brokers agreed to notify  this Ministry  of their principals within 24 hours of the commence- ment of the sale.   This agreement has already commenced to work  admirably.     Confectionery. A general licence, dated 13th November 1918, under the Sugar (Confectionery)  Order,  authorises  all  persons  concerned to  buy or sell  by retail crystallised and  glace  fruits at a price   not  exceeding 3^d. per  oz.  after  I5th November.     Feeding-stuffs. No immediate alleviation of the  present  shortage of  cakes  and meals is  anticipated, and there is little, likelihood that it. will be  possible for some time to relax any of the restrictions  placed on the distribution of these products under the scheme.  At the same time, no effort is  being spared to obtain  supplies wherever they can be obtained.   A notice  has been issued  increasing  by 50 per cent, the allowance to pig clubs and small owners of  pigs.     Meat-There are indications of diminution  in the supplies of  live stock coming forward.    It has  already been found  necessary to  export the  surplus  from  the Northumberland area to Scotland, and reports have been received that there may be difficulty  in filling the   whole of the army requirements during  next week.   This diminution  of home supplies, however, comes at an opportune  time, as it is highly desirable that issues of frozen meat  should  be made in order to provide accommoda- tion in the stores for the arrivals which may be expected during the next few weeks. As the situation appears at present, some small difficulty may be experienced in finding space for these arrivals, but instructions have been  issued  that all meat in doubtful condition or in  stores which cannot be relied upon to hold  the meat in soundcondition shall be issued  as speedily as possible.
     It i3 not intended to retard  the  supply of home-grown cattle more than hashitherto been the case, and it is also intended to fulfil the promise given by the FoodController that an increased import of live cattle from Ireland shall be permitted.     As a result of the shipment of stock fit for slaughter from the areas in the Southof England  to the Channel Islands without the permission of the  Food Controller, anOrder has been made prohibiting such export except by permit.     Potatoes. It is proposed to modify the existing Potato Distribution Scheme onthe following lines:  .     (a) The grading  of  potatoes into two grades according  to  variety will be           abolished.     (6) The fixed retail prices for potatoes of \\d. per lb. for Grade 1 and Id. per lb.           for Grade 2 will be abandoned.     (c) Within each zone the grower will be permitted to sell to any person at the           price fixed by the Joint Commission of the  Board of Agriculture and the           Ministry of Food.     (d) Wholesale dealers and retail dealers will be permitted to  sell on margins as           in the Potatoes Order 1917.     (e) The  export of potatoes from surplus to deficit zones  will continue under           control as under the present Scheme.     (/) Potatoes exported from surplus zones will be graded by  the zonal chairman          according to quality, and these different grades will be  sold in the deficit          zones in competition with the potatoes grown in the deficit zone.    The modifications in the Scheme abolish the accounting arrangements by whole-sale dealers and simplify the Scheme from the  trade  point of view without relaxing the control on distribution.                            ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.    The prosecutions for the week are as follows  :                                                Prosecutions.  Convictions.EnglandScotlandWalesIreland             Total       ------  850            822     Two sentences of imprisonment were passed, at Southwark and. at the Guildhall. In the Southwark. case,  which  was  an instance  of  issuing  two  Ration  Books, A. E. Smith, who had been sentenced to a month&apos;s hard labour, had an epileptic fit on leaving the Court.   The  Magistrate, in  consideration of  his being a  discharged soldier in delicate health, remitted the sentence to one of a  fine of  107,., to be paid in 21 days, or one months&apos; imprisonment.     At the Guildhall, W. Eaton was charged with adding water to milk intended for. sale, pleaded guilty, and was  sentenced  to  one months&apos; imprisonment in the  second division.             PART  II.-SUMMARY OF  THE  FOOD  POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    Imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the week ended November 16th(161,100 tons) were less satisfactory than those of  recent weeks and show a decline of 32,700 tons on those of the preceding week and of 21,400 tons on the  average weekly imports in the first 46 weeks of the year 1918.  The decrease on the week endedNovember 9th mainly affected oats (decrease  10,600 tons), maize (decrease 14,700 tons),rice (decrease 4,400 tons), sugar (decrease 6,900 tons), and cheese (decrease 3,200 tons).-  437           418-   42            42-   67            .60-  304           302
Very small quantities of barley, cheese, and coffee  arrived; on  the  other  hand, theimports of cocoa (increase 2,300 tons) and of tea (increase 5,100 tons) were heavy.    The total imports  for the  first  11 weeks  of  the  cereal  years  1917-18  and1918-19 are compared in the following table : Total Imports in the first 11 weeks of cereal year. 	1917.	1918.

Bread and Flour. The bakers&apos; returns  for the four weeks ended November 9thshow a fall of 2 per cent,  in the quantity of  flour used for bread or sold -the declinebeing mainly in the quantity used for  bread.  The fall is  the more remarkable asoccurring at a time of the year when a  seasonal increase might have been expected ;nor was the change anticipated by a decline in the quantities delivered from mills and issued  to agents  (Table  B (1)).  The stocks in bakers&apos; hands represent 11-1- days&apos;requirements  as  compared  with  12  days&apos;  requirements  last month  and  also  ayear ago.    Meat. The consumption  of meat remains  at  about the same level as in recent weeks, except in Ireland where seasonal  supplies of fat stock have been accompaniedby  an  increase of  consumption.   In the week ended 9th November 1,500 tons of imported, refrigerated meat were released, as  compared with 1,000 tons in precedingweeks, but a large proportion of this (850 tons) consisted of offals and boneless beefwhich are largely used  for sausage meat  and so  fall outside the ration.  It was not found necessary to draw on the stocks of home-grown meat in cold storage.    Fats.-Table  B (1)  shows  a  decrease  of  butter  and margarine entering  intoconsumption.   Traders&apos;  stocks  of margarine having  been  built up  to meet thereadjustment of the butter and margarine  ration  the  issues have heen reduced to current  requirements.  The excess of  estimated  consumption  over  domestic rationrequirements (representing a margin for caterers&apos; supplies  and losses)  is now reducedto 10 per cent.    Fish. Supplies of fish at Billingsgate  and at several large  provincial  markets for  the  week  ended 9th November  were 3,710 tons,  as  compared   with a weeklyaverage of 5,000  tons  for October. .  The decrease, however, is not abnormal at  thisseason.   Supplies at Billingsgate alone were 2,138 tons, as compared with 2,050 tonsin the corresponding week last year.                                    STOCKS.    Stocks show little change during the week ended 9th November.   Meat  (104,200tons) has increased  by a further 14,200 tons, Avhile bacon (76,500 tons) has fallen bya further 2,000 tons.   Condensed  milk  (canned) is stationary at the high figure of49,000 tons.                                 COST  OF LIVING.    The report of the Working Classes Cost  of Living Committee, recently published,deals with the increase since 1914  in the  cost of food as well  as  rent, clothing, fuel,insurance, household sundries and fares personal expenses of individual members ofthe family on  beer, tobacco, &amp;c., being omitted.  The average weekly expenditure of    A  (5822-3                    -                                          B
a standard urban working-class family (taken at 4*57 equivalent &quot; men &quot; or &quot; units &quot; )in July 1914 and June 1918 is estimated by the Committee as follows : _	Expenditure on Food.

Food accounts for 56 per cent, of the totalcost of living in 1914 and 63 per cent, in  1918, the proportions being higher in thecase of unskilled than skilled; the proportion spent on food  by skilled workmen&apos;sfamilies works out at 55 per cent, in 1914 and  61 per cent, in 1918, while the propor-tion spent on food by unskilled workmen&apos;s families works out at 57 per cent, in 1914and 65 per cent,  in  1918.   The increases  in the other items  comparable with  the90 per cent, increase in food are as follows clothing 96 per cent., rent 2 per cent.,fuel and light  79 per cent., insurance  no  increase, fares  20 per cent., and householdsundries  114 per cent.
