l/Gen.No./2253.                          WAR   CABINET.xtension of Powers under the  Defence  of  the Realm Acts &amp; Regulations.Memorandum by the  Secretary of State  for War.1.        In War Cabinet paper No.  G.T.0200 the Minister  ofMunitions requests immediate  consideration for the  following  :-     (l)  The extension of the duties and powers of tho Minister      of Munitions as conferred by the Ministry of  Munitions  Act      1915, so as clearly to  include the. reinstatement of      industries from a war basis to that of peace.     (2)  Tho extension of the general  objects set  out in the      Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations,  so as to make      it clear that the powers thereby conferred are not  confined      to purposes inseparably connected with the present  war, but      are to be considered as extending to purposes consequential      thereon and involved in the above suggested extension of      the Ministry of Munitions Act.2.        The at my Council are advised that the production ofcivil material under tho Defence of the Realm powers could bocontrolled by the Admiralty,  Army Council, and Minister of Munitionsby arrangement with the Board of Trade  under Regulation 2JJ.  this regulation eropowers the Board of Trade  to .apply,  and to delegate to other Departments tho right to apply,  to &quot;any article  ofcommerce&quot; the powers of the Food Controller under Regulations 8B,,2PM  to 2J, and 7.          By this arrangement there can be applied:-Regulation 2B.  Requisition at cost and pre-war profit or at  a pricefixed by Order, Whichever may.be tho less.Regulation 2ff.  Regulation of production, manufacture, treatment, use,consumption, transport, storage, distribution, supply, sale orpurchase (including fixing of price).Regulation 20.  Compulsory returns.Regulation 2GG. Requisition of factory, workshop, premises or plant.Regulation 7*   Requisition of output at cost, and  pre-War profit.          The War Office has  already had recourse to the  above plwersby arrangement with the Board of Trade, and it is thought that theywill be sufficient to enable  the fighting Departments to  diverttheir various controls on to  civil production during the  currency of the Defence of the Realm Act and Regulations.3,        If, however, the Minister of Mumitions is satisfied thathis esercise of powers of civil control delegated by tho  Board ofTrade under Regulation 2JJ must be limited to the purpose specifiedin the Ministry of Munitions  Act, 1915, 2(1) viz: &quot;in connection withthe supply of munitions&quot;, it  is, of coureo, for him to take steps for hi3 own protection.          The Army Council arc not concerned with any steps taken bythe Ministry of Munitions to  remedy the defects inherent  in the termsof their creation by the Act  of 1915, as there is no parallel in the                                                             case/
 case  of the Council to the limitations imposed on the Ministry by their appointment for a specific war purpose and their compulsory winding-up twelve months after the conclusion of tho war. 4,        The War Office is, however, interested in the second branch of the Minister1s proposal, which seeks to secure statutory sanction for the use of  &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; powers for reconstruction and reinstatement purposes, as it is equally committed to a system of commercial and  industrial controls which cannot possibly be liquidated without such powers *          The powers requisite for this purpose have been enumerated in detail by the War Office Emergency Legislation Committee, and it had been thought that all Departments would proceed simultaneously with  their demands for post-war powers.  If however, the Ministry desire to proceed at once, it is undesirable that their claim should receive separate consideration; if only because express statutory sanction for the powers of the Ministry alone might seriously jeopardise the  legal position of the powers of the Army Council, until they had  received similar  authority. 5.        It follows that if the Ministry are not content with (l) of their Memorandum and press for (2), the War Office must put forward a simultaneous demand for the extension of (2) to the Army Council, and the appl.ice.tion of it to the Regulations enumerated by the War Office Emergency Legislation Committee- with the addition. of Regulation 2JW and its subsidiaries. 6.        Legislation is also urgently required by the V/ar Office on a  subject connected with the exercise of the Defence of the Realm powers, which should be included, for purposes of expedition, in the above demand.  The substitution of requisition and the costings-system for purchase by contract has involved the acquisition of vast amounts of property under the compulsory powers conferred upei; the Army Council by Regulations 2B and 7 of the Defence of the Realm Regulations,  In viow of possible legal doubts as to the validity of j those Regulations, it was proposed by the Defence of the Realm Regulations Amendment Committee early in 1917 to provide by a draft Defence of the  Realm (Compensation for $ZSB)  Bill that no personmight recover against the Crown by way of petition of right or in any other proceeding (e *g, by claim before the Defence of the RealmLosses Commission) otherwise than in accordance with the principles provided in Regulations 2B and 7,          Litigation against the Crown which succeeded in impeaching i the validity of Regulation 2B would involve the War Office, on thehead  of Wool alonet in the payment of claims estimated at approximate! ly  4,000,000,  and of claims to at least equal amounts on account cf leather and  other raw materials;  the Regulations have also been used to an enormous extent for the acquisition of manufactured articles,  and their continued validity is essential to the Wak1 Office.  It is  assumed that it is of at least equal importance to the Ministry of Munitions.- 7.        It is therefore submitted on behalf of the War Office:-      (l)   That  (2) of the Memorandum of the Minister of Munitions      should be extended to the Army Council  and applied to the      Regulations enumerated by the  War Office Emergency Legislation      Committee with the addition of Regulations 2EE,  2JJ, and the      Regulations to which the latter refers.      (2)   That  it should belprovided on the lines laid down in the      Defence of the Realm (Compensation for Loss)  Bill that      compensation is not recoverable otherwise than in accordance      with the principles provided in Regulations 2B.  and 7.
