CONFIDENTIAL.G.T.-6357.ALSACE-LORRAINE.    ALSACE-LORRAINE supplies- a good example of  the  sort of difficulty thatattends the simple application of the &quot; Principle of Nationality.&quot;    These provinces, as everyone knows, were once part of the loosely organisedmediaeval Empire; and though they were willingly, evenly enthusiastically, attached toFrance for a hundred years before the catastrophe of 1871, a  considerable section oftheir population have always spoken  German as their mother tongue.  After 1871,many emigrated rather  than  become  German subjects; their  places have no doubtbeen  largely  taken by  Germans, and the additional labour  required to meet the immense mining and industrial development of  recent years has not been drawn from french sources.    It seems doubtful, therefore, whether &quot;Self-determination&quot; in the  shape of  a plebiscite would give a clear majority for re-union with France ; the appeal to historycan be made, and is made, by both parties ;  no argument can be founded on race, andthe argument from language is double-edged.    In these circumstances how  do we justify our resolve to restore, in their integrity,these  districts to the French Republic ?   Only, I suppose, on the grounds  that thearrangement  of 1871 constituted a  violent interruption of a beneficent process  ofdevelopment, that it was  made  avowedly in the interests  of militarism, and had no reference whatever to the wishes or traditions of the population  concerned.  In such circumstances it is not only legitimate but necessary to restore continuity with a stillliving past, and  thus re-knit the severed  threads of history.   We have to  remember that the voters,  in a given  plebiscite, are not infallible judges of the essential  spirit ofa people, or the character  of their enduring ideals.   Some  good judgeB tell me that Iam wrong to  doubt  the  results of plebiscite that if a brief period (say, six  months)were given before a vote was  taken,  so  that the ancient  dwellers in those Provincescould  return the verdict of the  voters would be overwhelmingly French.   This maybe so.  But I would not  risk it.A. J. B.October 18,1918.
