jThis Document is the  Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]    142 CONFIDENTIAL.    G.T.-6355.    IN the case of Poland there are no physical difficulties in the way of carrying intoeffect  the  Principle of Nationalities; but we cannot say the  same thing of Bohemia.Along a considerable  portion of  the northern and western borders  of  the ancientkingdom, Nature and history conspire to establish a frontier which unfortunately doesnot strictly correspond with the ethnological distribution of population.  It seems, and perhaps is, absurd to redraw the Bohemian frontier so as to leave in German hands thewhole mountain chain which guards the country from German invasion.  Yet if this be not done there will be in the new Ozecho-Slovak state a German element amountingto not less than one-quarter of the whole population, compactly situated, bitterly hostile to their Slav neighbours, and  in sympathy with the Saxons, Bavarians, and German-Austrians   dwelling beyond  their  border,  and with  the  German  capitalists andGermanised nobles within them.CZECHOSLOVAKSA. J.  B.October 18, 1918.
