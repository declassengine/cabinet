m snpmm or m PLACING OF QBMRS DUBIKG PERIOD  OF                      aHSITlGN.            Memorandum by the  President  of  the(3f/2                 Board of Trade.     It  is  obviously highly desirable that f irms which havebeen employed on making&quot;munitions should as quickly aspossible  transfer their energies to civilian work, and withthis end  in view Local Authorities and Public Utility under-takings  should be encouraged to proceed with works delayedor becoming urgent during the liar and to place the necessary orders.    The matter has been discussed between the Board of Tradeand the Ministry of Munitions and it lias been agreed to putforward proposals that the Board of Trade should collect orders from the  Local Authorities and Public Utility undertakings,while  the Ministry should undertake the placing of the orders and the release oi material.     for  this purpose, if approved, the two Departments will setup a small  administration under the general supervision of sir arthur Luckham. and representatives of the Local GovernmentBoard and Scottish Office will bo invited to be present when matters concerning their Departments are under consideration.     It was originally considered that it might be necessary forone or other Department to assume financial responsibility xorcertain orders. e.g. stock orders for stores required by publicundertakings, but it is hoped that this will as a general rulenot be required and it is indeed probable that firms would oftheir own accord set to work to build up their depleted com*-vmercial stocks, especially if relieved of Government contracts.   There  may, however, be exceptional oases in which assistance might, be  given\ say, by financing manufacture by a firm of   :.  -approved  standard articles to stock up to 5($ for a fixed period, the Government being repaid on the sale of the articles.    fhera may be a reluctance on the part of some Authorities, toplace orders at once, in the hope that prices will fall withinthe next  year, and it mav possibly be necessary in order to -expedite  the placing of orders, thai the Public Authorities or companies should be financially assisted by the Governmentsomewhat  on the lines of the Coventry terms;  that is to say,that the  Government would bear the difference in cost of placing the order to-day and say, in a yearrs time.     There are two other ways in which the placing of orders?would be  encouraged, viz: the relaxation or abolition of the embargo on borrowing by Local Authorities and a more lenientattitude  to the issue of additional capital by commercial &apos;firms, and  it is-understood that some steps are being takenin both these matters.                                        v     In ether cases when it is found that an industry is notplacing orders for plant, steps would be taken to investigate.and endeavour to remove any obstruction that was found to- taist.     I should be glad to have immediate sanction to the action proposed, including the taking of financial responsibility,where necessary, in the cases referred to in the Memorandum.AXSMM.Board of Trade,     21st November,  1918.
