IF  the enemy be completely beaten  the  problem  of re-arranging bis  territoriesaccording to the &quot; Principle of Nationality &quot;  or the &quot; Principle of Self-determination &quot;seems simple enough.  Unfortunately it is not so, partly because these  principles  donot completely harmonise with each other; partly because outside Europe they have atthe best but a qualified application ;  partly because in  practice  they are traversed  byother considerations,  historical, political, and strategic which cannot be wholly  ignored.We cannot therefore follow out either of these with logical  exactness to its extremistconclusion.  It is impossible,  for example,  to take a map  of Central and  eastern europe and simply redraw all the State frontiers according to our latest ethnographicalinformation without amendment or qualification.   The sentiment of nationality depends on  many things  besides race;   and  self-determination  in  its full and enduringsignificance cannot be safely measured by the results of a single plebiscite.  The vote of a community, or of a  selected fraction of a community, will show (if it be fairly taken)which of a small number of simple alternatives it prefers.   But such a vote, consideredby itself, supplies no sufficient evidence  of those lasting sentiments  on which alonestable States are founded.    These considerations, however, merely show that  the  &quot; principle of nationality &quot;and the &quot; principle of self-determination  &quot; should be applied with caution.   They donot show that  they  supply our  principal guides in  any  re-arrangement  of central european frontiers.   They may not be complete or infallible, but cause must be shownwhy in any particular case they should be ignored.    Non-European countries will  be dealt with later.                                                                     A. J.  B.    October 1918.1
