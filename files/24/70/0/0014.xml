MEMORANDUMSpecial 7.QMUCbfh     BRITISH COMMITMENTS TO BIN SAUD.ON     BIN SAUD is the hereditary ruler of the Wahabi State of Nejd (capital Er-Riadh).Early in the nineteenth century his ancestors, under the impetus of the Puritanical reli-gious movement of which they  were the champions, spread their power widely over the surrounding tribes and oases, and ruled for a moment from  the  Persian Gulf to theRed Sea.  Later in the century they suffered adversity.  Their power was broken  byMehemet All.  The hegemony of Central Arabia passed to the rival Bin  Rashid houseof Jebel Shammar (capital Hail),  and in  1871 the  Turks  planted garrisons in theal-Hasa province, along the Gulf Coast between Koweit and al-Katar.   The Bin  Saudpower was  confined  to the interior, and during this period  there was  practically  nocontact between it and His Majesty&apos;s Government.     The situation was radically altered, however, by two events in 1913.   In May thatyear. Abd-ul-Aziz Bin Saud, the reigning prince of that house, expelled the Turkishgarrisons from Hasa and  reoccupied the coast.   And  on the  29th July  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment signed a  Convention with Turkey, in which they recognised as belongingto the &quot; Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd &quot; the coastline and interior west of a line drawn northand south from a point on the mainland opposite Zakhnuniyah Island (Gulf of Bahrein)to latitude 20&quot; in the Ruba-al-Khali desert (Article 11).     This conjunction of events placed His Majesty&apos;s Government in a difficult position.Since Bin Saud had become not merely the ruler of a section of the Gulf Coast, but themost powerful of all the local rulers, it was inevitable that  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould have  direct  relations with  him over the arms  traffic,  British  trade, and hisdealings with neighbouring Arab States (Koweit, Katar, Trucial Chiefs, &amp;c.) already intreaty relations with  His Majesty&apos;s Government.   On  the  other hand, Bin Saudsde facto independence in Hasa was  not recognised  by Turkey, and we had agreed withthe Turkish Government to regard . his coast  and country as Turkish  territory, and himself, by  implication, as a Turkish subject.     On the instructions  of Sir  P. Cox, at that time  British  Resident in the persian gulf, the British Residents at Koweit (Captain Shakespear) and Bahrein met Bin  Saudon the 15th and 16th December, 1913. At this meeting Bin Saud invited His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to keep the peace on his coast, showed the British representatives the  draft agreement which the Turks were trying to make him accept, and practically asked forBritish mediation (6117/1990/14).     The Turkish conditions communicated to us by Bin Saud were as follows :      1. The readmission of the  Turkish garrisons to the  province and coast of Hasa, as           formerly.     2. The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers  by direct &quot; farmans&quot; issued           by the Sultan.     3. The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of  T.  3,000.     4. The reference of all communications from foreign  Powers or their representatives           to the Turkish authorities for disposal.     5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province.     6. An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies           for railways or motor-car services.     On the 9th March, 1914,  the  Foreign  Office  presented  a  memorandum to HakkiPasha, who was at that time conducting negotiations in London on behalf of the TurkishGovernment, in which the difficulty of His Majesty&apos;s  Governments position in regardto Bin Saud was  explained, the Turkish conditions  cited (without the  source of our information being stated), and a  protest made against the last  three of them (10569/14).    In this memorandum British desiderata in, regard to Bin Saud, subject, of course,to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, were denned as follows :-     1. That he should not meddle in the territory or  politics of Arab  principalities  in          the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Katar.      [939]      ,                      -                                B
     2. That, like other Sheikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf, he should co-operate for           the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce, i.e., the suppression           of piracy and the pursuit of inter-tribal hostilities by the passage of armed           dhows at sea.     3. That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic.     4. That British traders  should be  freely admitted to Katif and properly  treated           while there.     Meanwhile, negotiations between the&apos; Turks and  Bin Saud proceeded, and  resulted in a  treaty signed  by Bin  Saud  and the Vali of  Basra on  the 15th May,  1914 (236112/4650/16).  The terms of this treaty may be summarised here :      Article 1. Signatories&apos; names ; secrecy ;  validity.     Article 2. The vilayet of  Nejd to remain in charge of Abd-ul-Aziz Pasha al-Saud for life.  His descendants to succeed  by Imperial firman, &quot; provided he remains  loyal to the Imperial Government.&quot;     Article 3, A &quot; technical military official &quot; (? euphemism for Turkish resident) to be appointed  by Bin Saud,  to  live wherever he (Bin Saud) wishes.  Turkish  military instructors to  be  employed by Bin Saud at his discretion.     Article 4. (Turkish) soldiers  and  gendarmerie  to be  posted, at Bin Saud&apos;s discretion,  in sea ports.     Article 5. Customs,  taxes,  ports,  lighthouses,  to be administered by Bin  Saud according to Ottoman regulations.     Article 6. Deficiency of  local revenues  to be  met out  of  customs,  ports, telegraphs  and posts  revenue.   Any surplus in this imperial revenue, and 10 percent. of any surplus in  local revenues,  to be remitted to Constantinople.     Article 7. Turkish flag to be flown on buildings and shipping.     Article 8. Correspondence  regarding supply of arms to be conducted with Marine Department at Constantinople.     Articled. &quot;The  said  Vali and  Commandant (ie., Bin Saud)  is not allowed to interfere with  or correspond about foreign affairs and international treaties, or to grant concessions to foreigners.&quot;     Article 10. Bin Saud to correspond direct with Ministries of Interior and Marine at Constantinople.     Article 11. Post  offices to be established in  vilayet of  Nejd.   Stamps to be Turkish.     Article 12. In case  of  internal  disturbance in Turkey, or war between Turkey and  a foreign Power,  &quot; if the  Government asks the said Vali for a force to co-operate with  its own  forces,  it is incumbent on the  Vali to prepare a sufficient force  with provisions and  ammunition, and to respond to  the demand at once, according to his power and ability.&quot;     During the  course of these  negotiations  between Bin Saud and Turkey, and, in fact, during the whole period between the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, and  the outbreak of war between  Great  Britain and Turkey on the 31st October, 1914, His  Majesty&apos;s Government discouraged Bin  Saud&apos;s advances to them, and did their utmost to comply  with the spirit of the Convention.&apos;     During the  interval  between  the  beginning of the war&apos; in Europe  and the inter- vention of Turkey, when  the attitude of the Turkish Government was becoming more and  more hostile to the  Allies, rumours reached His Majesty&apos;s Government that  Bin Saud was  preparing to throw  in  his lot  with the Turks.&apos;  The  Turks did, in  fact, attempt  to reconcile Bin  Saud and Bin Rashid, and  secure their military co-operation on the Turkish side.   But  Bin Saud  evaded these overtures (84042/46261/14  and 17000/1385/15 : No. 48).  In October 1914  the Sheikh of Koweit wrote to him on his own  initiative, stating that he proposed to stand by His Majesty&apos;s Government himself, and that he advised him to do the same (59746/46261/14).  And Bin Saud wrote  back that  &quot; in the event of war with  Turkey he would stand by the  Sheikh and the British Government&quot;  (63562/14).     The earlier  rumours that  Bin Saud was inclining towards the Turks, and the importance, in the event of war with  Turkey,  of securing his  friendship, had already decided the India Office  to  send  Captain  Shakespear, formerly British Resident at Koweit, on a special mission to Bin Saud (59038/46261/14). On the 4th October, 1914, the Besident in the Persian Gulf was  instructed to inform Bin  Saud of this intentionthrough the Sheikh of Koweit;  and on the 8th October, 1914, instructions were sent to
 the Viceroy for a further communication (also to be made through Koweit) explaining His Majesty&apos;s Government^ attitude towards Turkey, and asking Bin Saud  to  help them to keep the peace in Arabia, in the  event  of Turkish aggression leading  to  war. Three Arabic letters were accordingly drafted at Koweit, one by the  British Resident and the other two by the Sheikh (82216/14), in which Bin Saud was addressed in the sense of the India Office instructions and was informed of Captain Shakespear&apos;s mission. These letters were despatched on  the  15th  October,  1914.   In answer-to them, Bin Saud wrote letters on the 24th October, 1914, to the Political Resident in the Gulf and to Captain Shakespear himself. The letter to Captain  Shakespear was conveyed through Bin  Saud&apos;s  lieutenant on the  Hasa  coast, and the latter was instructed to arrange a meeting  for him  with Captain  Shakespear when that  officer  arrived (5353/1385/15).     Meanwhile, on the  14th September,  1914, the Officiating Political  Resident in the Persian Gulf had submitted to the Government of India drafts of letters and notices to the different Gulf Chiefs,  which  he  had  prepared for the event of  war between Great  Britain and Turkey, and  which  he proposed  to issue  upon  the  receipt of intelligence that war had broken out (64214/61439/14).     The draft letter to  Bin Saud (which was to follow a brief circular announcing  that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Turkey) ran as follows :          &quot;In continuation of  my  previous letter,  informing your Excellency of the     outbreak of  war between  Great Britain and  Turkey,  I am authorised by my     Government to request  your Excellency to co-operate with  our honoured  friends,     their  Excellencies the  Sheikhs of  Koweit and  Mohammerah,  in  the  capture     of Basrah from the Turks or, should such a task be beyond your united  powers,     which seems unlikely, that you should make such  arrangements, especially above     Gurnah, as may prevent assistance reaching Basrah, until such time as the British    arrive and take over  the city.  Consistently with your  main  object, viz., the     capture or isolation of Basrah, we request your  Excellency to take all measures in    your power to prevent the plundering of British merchants and  property in the    town  of  Basrah itself and  in the neighbourhood.   The personal  safety  of    the Europeans should also be a special object of your solicitude.         &quot; In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government    to assure your Excellency that, in the event of our success and succeed we shall,    insha  Allah Basrah will  never  again be  allowed to be  subject to  Turkish    authority.         &quot; I  am  further to  assure your Excellency  that  the   British Government    will guarantee your Excellency          &quot;1.  Against all reprisals by the Turks in consequence of these measures ;         &quot;2.   Against attack by sea ; and         &quot; 3.  That  they will  be prepared to recognise your Excellency as independent               Ruler of Nejd and al-Hasa, and to enter into  treaty relations  with               your Excellency.         &quot; I am also directed to request  your Excellency to turn the Turkish garrisons    of al-Hasa and al-Qatif out of your territory.&quot;    This draft was approved in due course by the Government of India and  the  IndiaOffice, and the letter seems  to  have been released for delivery on the 3rd November,1914 (82713/61439/14 :  pp. 7-8, 15-6, and 17).  The three assurances  contained in it became the basis of the subsequent negotiations.    Bin Saud&apos;s reply, dated the 28th November, 1914 (17000/1385/15 : No.  46) wasphrased as follows :--         &quot;We have received  your  august  communication dated the  3rd November,    1914, in which you  state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous    letter that the  exalted Government of Great  Britain has  declared war against the    Ottoman Government, and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Govern-    ment to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh  of Mohammerah and the Ruler of    Koweit our cordial friends and sincere allies and attack   Basrah.....   The    co-operation with the above-mentioned two friends is incumbent upon us  (and so is    it for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all    useful actions which may be required by her.  And I am using my endeavours and    efforts in furthering the&apos; common interests of all friends.  You should  rest fully    assured and be confident in this question.
         &quot; I  am one  of the greatest  helpers to the Government of Great Britain, and     she  will, God  willing, obtain  satisfactory  results, as we  have mentioned  to our     mutual friend, Captain Shakespear.  As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow     a single one  of  them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation, and have     turned them all out.         &quot; But as to the following three matters mentioned by  you, namely, the promise     of the exalted Government to protect and  safeguard us  against  the  Ottoman     Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection (to us) against     any  attack  and hostility which may be made  by sea, her recognition of the     independence  of  my chiefship on  all the parts  of Nejd, al-Hasa, and Qatif, and the     conclusion  of treaties  between us, (these) will depend on our arrival  at Koweit.  I     am leaving my headquarters  on this  date and am bound for Koweit, and we will     make  the necessary verbal negotiations, in order that we may earn the approval of     our friend, the Government of Great Britain.&quot;     No further steps were taken on the British side till Captain Shakespear, travelling&quot;via  Bahrein  and  Koweit,  reached  Bin  Saud&apos;s   camp  on  the 31st December,  1914(30472/1385/15 :  No.  2).     During the next few days he discussed exhaustively with Bin Saud the  latterVrelations  with  Great Britain  and  Turkey  since their previous  meeting  a year before.Bin Saud referred to the various messages he had received from representatives of GreatBritain during  the past three months, and  dwelt especially  upon  the  letter  of the3rd  November, 1914, from the Officiating  Resident in  the Gulf.  He cited the threeassurances contained in it, but remarked that      &quot;the document was  a vague  letter, did not  specify whether the assurances were     limited  merely to the  present  war  or also included the future,  gave  no hint     whether  other conditions would  be required  of  himself  later,  and  could  not be     regarded as a binding instrument between the  two parties  for the future.&quot;   * Captain Shakespear concluded from these conversations that Bin Saud      &quot; had  no intention of abandoning his  neutral position, with freedom to make his     own arrangements with the Turks (and he was confident that he could  secure from     them a very good &apos; second best&apos;)  until  he held a signed and sealed treaty with the     British Government; nor would, he move a step  further  towards making matters     either  easier for us or more  difficult  for the Turks so far as the present war was     concerned, until he obtained in that treaty some very solid  guarantee of his position,     with Great Britain practically as  his suzerain.&quot;     Captain  Shakespear therefore  asked  Bin  Saud to draw  up &quot; a preliminary draft,containing  what he was prepared to  accept and what he desired,&quot; which he (CaptainShakespear) might then forward to His Majesty&apos;s Government  for their consideration.     This suggestion was  promptly carried  out by  Bin  Saud, and in a report, dated the4th January,  1915, to Sir P. Cox (in which the foregoing conversations were also put on record) Captain Shakespear submitted a rough translation of Bin Saud&apos;s desiderata :          &quot; The clauses  which will  be reasons for  a binding agreement between myself     (&apos; Bin Saud&apos;) and the Great British Government         &quot;1.  That  the British Government will  acknowledge  and admit that Nejd,.               al-Hasa, Qatif, their surroundings  and the ports appertaining to  them               on  the  shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of               my fathers and forefathers ; that  I am the independent  ruler of them,               and after me my  sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that               the above-mentioned territory is  an independent territory in  which               there is no (right of) interference to any  foreign Power.         &quot; 2. That they  (the  British Government) will declare its (the territory&apos;s)               boundaries north, south, east, and  west,  by land and by sea, and that                (regarding)  the  nomads who wander between neighbouring  towns,                which are either under British protection or (directly)  under British                Government,  if there  should  arise  differences  between me and the                chiefs of  the  said  towns and complaints be made in (these) matters,                they  should  be  decided  according to the ownership of fathers and                ancestors.
          &quot; 3. That  all existing jurisdiction in  all my territories  shall  continue  in                accordance  with  the  laws of the  sacred  Mohammedan  Shariat,                according to the sect of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal-as-Salafi, and all who                dwell  therein  shall be  subject  to them  in  all matters or (shall  be                subject)  to the customary  law of the towns in which  they  may be,                whether  my own subjects  or  the  subjects of States adjacent to my                territories by reason  of religious obligation we are helpless without it                nor can we exceed it.          &quot; 4. There shall be no permission to any foreigner to acquire a hand&apos;s-breadth                of my territories (within  the defined) boundaries,  not  even  by a                substitute, except after reference to myself and with  my permission.          &quot; 5. After acknowledgment of the above clauses, that she (Great Britain) will                promise to prevent and to defend  from all oppression and aggression                which  may come upon or happen to my territories  by land or by sea,                from whatever Power it may be.          &quot; 6. That  she (Great  Britain) will  promise that she will not  permit nor                encourage nor accord  sanctuary  to  accused  persons  or fugitives from                our territories, whether townsmen or nomads.          &quot; 7. That she (Great  Britain)  will respect and protect the rights of my subjects,                and deal with  them as she deals with her own subjects while they may                be (resident) in her territories and dependencies.          &quot; 8. If she (Great  Britain) accepts and acknowledges the foregoing clauses,                then I accept and  acknowledge  severance of dealings with any other                Power in all  (matters of)  concessions,  interference, and intercourse,                except with reference to the Great British Government.          &quot; 9. I bind myself to protect  trade within  my territories from all aggression,                and that I will deal (with her subjects) according to the treatment my                own subjects receive in all matters  of  government and business in her                (Great Britain&apos;s) countries and  dependencies.          &quot;10. I bind myself to the protection (in) the coasts and ports which are under                my Government  from all aggression  to the  subjects of the  British                Government and those under their protection.          &quot;11. I will forbid the traffic in arms and ammunition, whether  by a Govern-                ment or by (way of) merchandise, from all  the ports  which  are  under                my Government, on condition that if I should be in need of anything                in  arms and  ammunition I will  refer to the British Government in                order to obtain my wants.&quot;     In forwarding this document, Captain  Shakespear added some observations of hisown, which have still, after four years, an important bearing on the eventual settlementof our permanent relations with Bin Saud after  the war : *         &quot; I  venture to submit that Bin Saud, in effect, asks for  little more than what     has been already conveyed in the Acting Residents  assurances, if these were     meant to apply to  the  future  and were not  limited to the present crisis, and  if     they are  interpreted  liberally and generously.   In exchange, Bin Saud offers to     make himself a British vassal for good.  The addition  to  our  responsibilities does     not appear heavy :          &quot;(a.) The Turkish menaces  from  the west and north of Nejd, though very                real to Bin Saud, need give us no anxiety we have  no reason to                suppose they will  be  more  successful in the future  than  they have                been  within the last  two or three  decades, while,  guaranteed from                attack  by sea, Bin Saud will be in a far  better  position to meet them                than was  possible  hitherto.   Should  they  become threatening, strong                diplomatic representations   would  probably suffice  to  prevent any               attempt on a scale with which Bin Saud could not cope himself.         &quot; (6.) We should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more               frequently than hitherto  between the  Arab  Sheikhs along  the coast               and Bin Saud,  a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests.    * Three weeks later, on the 24th January, 1915, Captain Shakespear was killed in a battle betweenBin Saud and Bin Eashid, at which he had insisted on being present.  No blame attaches to Bin Saud forthis lamentable event.       [939]                                                                C
          &quot; On the other hand, the advantages seem to be considerable :           &quot; (a.) Complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf.          &quot; (b.) Similar complete control of the arms traffic.          &quot;(c.) The practical  exclusion  of foreign  Powers and influence in Central                 Arabia.          &quot; (d.) The security induced by British suzerainty and &apos; Bin  SaudV  strong                 control of the Bedouin tribes  will  give  a great  impetus  to  trade                 through the  Persian  Gulf ports, probably diverting a  share of what                 now passes through the Red Sea ports.          &quot; (e.) The great influence Bin Saud has over Mohammedan  opinion in Arabia,                 an influence likely to increase  as  the Turkish Empire breaks up and                 the Khalifate of the Sultan is questioned,  will be a British asset.          &quot; (/.) Bin Saud&apos;s influence  with all Arab tribes, and particularly with the                 Northern Anazah, with whom our occupation of Lower Mesopotamia                 will bring us in close contact.      Upon  receipt of  Captain  Shakespear&apos;s report,  Sir P. Cox  telegraphed on the 16th January, 1915, to the Government of India (17000/1385/15 : No.  49) a summary of Bin Saud&apos;s desiderata, and made the following further suggestions:           &quot; Bin Saud should undertake :           &quot;First. To  receive  representative of British  Government  either  at  his      capital or sea-port or both, if desired.          &quot;Secondly. To  agree  (to)  extra-territoriality  for  our  non-Mohammedan      subjects.          &quot; Thirdly. To  abstain  from waging war by sea without our consent, and to      co-operate for the suppression of piracy.          &quot; Fourthly. To protect pilgrim traffic passing through his territory.          &quot;Fifthly. To  levy customs  dues at  rates which we consider  reasonable,      having regard to  rate prevailing at Bahrein and Koweit.          &quot; Sixthly. To allow British merchant vessels to visit his ports.          &quot;Seventhly. To agree to locate  post office and  possibly telegraph office at his      port when the time comes.&quot;          &quot; I  do not include  any  item  regarding slave  trade, as that  is not now a     serious difficulty,  and has given us no trouble at Koweit.          &quot; Only point regarding which  it seems necessary to offer comment here is the     question of protection against&apos; external aggression  by land.  When  we  invited     Bin  Saud  to  move on  Basrah, we undertook  to protect him against reprisals by     Turks, so that, as far as latter are concerned, what Bin Saud now  asks us to give     does not amount  to much  more.   Apart from Turks, Central Arabia is practically     inaccessible by land to any Power but ours, and I venture to think that we should     incur little risk by giving  the desired undertaking, subject to  (the) reservation     that aggression be unprovoked.          &quot; We have publicly declared  that our object is to  effect liberation of Arabs     from oppressive yoke (of) Turkey.   In this case there is no question of annexation     of territory to which  our allies  could take  exception, while Bin Saud&apos;s weight in     scale would be no mean asset to joint cause of us all.   Can I possibly be authorised     to draft a treaty on above  lines for negotiation by Captain Shakespear ?   I shall     not now have the opportunity of meeting Bin Saud myself.          &quot; I am obliged to give Bin Saud some reply by his messenger, who has  orders     to return at once.  I am  sending Captain Shakespear purport  of above additional     points  and asking him to use his discretion in discussing them with Bin Saud.   To     Bin Saud I am replying that  I hope that an  instrument safeguarding his  position     can be arrived at; somewhat on lines indicated, and  that I have telegraphed  to     Government on subject,  but that treaty must necessarily take a little  time  to     draw up.&quot;     On  the  29th January,  1915, after  further  correspondence  with  Sir  P. Cox(21633/15, Nos.  3 and 8), the  Viceroy telegraphed  to the  India  Office  as  follows(11837/1385/15):         &quot;In  order to expedite settlement, Bin  Saud has  himself  submitted memo- f     randum setting forth tentatively his proposals  for formulation of treaty.   These
 include  many matters of detail,  fraught with difficulty and requiring  ripe con- sideration for instance, definition of boundaries, law and jurisdiction, harbouring of refugees, reciprocal treatment of subjects, arras traffic, and arms facilities.     &quot; We consider early conclusion of treaty with  Bin Saud most important, but that, for the present, it should be  on broad lines somewhat  similar to the original Afghanistan agreement with Abdur Rahman, and suggest following :      &quot;1.  British Government recognises Bin  Saud as independent ruler of Nejd,            Hasa, and Katif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty,            subject to the acceptance  of successors  by tribesmen  and approval of            His Majesty&apos;s Government;     &quot; 2.  In the event of unprovoked aggression on his  territories by any foreign            Power, British Government  are prepared to aid Bin Saud to such extent            and in such manner as the situation may require;     &quot; 3.  In return, Bin Saud agrees  to have no dealings with any other  foreign            Power, nov grant concessions to  subjects of any other foreign  Power,            except on the advice of the  British Government, which advice  he will            unreservedly follow;     &quot; 4.  British Government and  Bin Saud agree to conclude, as soon as this can            be arranged, a detailed  treaty  in regard  to  other matters  jointly            concerning them.     &quot; Cox agrees that a preliminary  treaty on  these lines  would meet  the  case) and thinks Bin Saud would accept it.   Dynastic guarantee of some kind would probably  be essential .*  That proposed appears sufficiently guarded.&quot; On the 30th January, 1915, the India  Office  communicated this  telegram to thesign Office with the following observations (11837/1385/15) :-     &quot; The desirability of concluding  a treaty with Amir Abdul  Aziz follows not merely from the exigencies of the moment,  which make it  necessary to pay  an immediate price for his friendship, but also from the general situation  that will  be created in the Persian Gulf in the event, as the result of the present war, of the disappearance of Turkish rule from Basra, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are pledged.  It may be  anticipated that the Amir of Nejd will be left the master not only of Central Arabia, but also *of a  long strip of the coast, and in the interest of peace and order it will be essential for the Power that controls the Gulf to have a working arrangement with him.  The extent, therefore,  to which  his claims must be met must be measured not only by the immediate services  which he is expected to render, but also by the  potential  powTer  for mischief which, in  the  event  of success, he will possess, and if permanently estranged will doubtless exercise.     &quot; As regards the terms of the treaty suggested by the Government of India, the  dynastic  pledge  is undoubtedly  the  crux, but safeguarded in  the  manner proposed  it appears  to be  free from  reasonable objection.   It is, however, more than  probable that the  condition that the  successor must  be accepted by the tribesmen will be  a  stumbling-block  to Bin Saud,  as  it was  to the Sheikh  of Mohammerah, in whose  case His Majesty&apos;s Government, under  the pressure of the war, have recently approved its abolition.   Moreover, regard being had  to the very large area over which  Bin Saud is  to rule and  the notoriously factious temper of the Arabs, it may be very difficult  to fulfil  in practice.  We must  therefore  be prepared for opposition from Bin Saud, and the  Marquess of Crewe would not let the negotiations break down over this point.     &quot; The guarantee  against  unprovoked  aggression  should,  in his  Lordship&apos;s opinion, be so worded as to make His  Majesty&apos;s Government sole judges  of the nature and extent of the assistance to be given.     &quot; Subject  to  these  remarks  Lord Crewe commends  the proposals of the Government of India to Sir E. Grey&apos;s favourable consideration.   It is a  question whether, in view of the importance of our eventual relations with Bin  Saud, the present treaty should not contain a clause binding him (subject to an agreement as to boundaries in the detailed treaty  to be concluded later)  to abstain from inter- ference with Koweit, Bahrein, al-Katar, and the  Trucial Chiefs.   His Lordship would propose to suggest  this  to the Government of India, but to  leave it  to their discretion.* The Turks had given Bin Saud a dynastic guarantee in their Treaty of the 15th May, 1914.
     On the 1st February, 1915, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, instructed the Viceroy, in the sense of the above letter, as follows (11837/15 ;. 14168/15):-          &quot; Your proposals are approved subject to following remarks :            &quot;  1.  In dynastic guarantee  condition  of acceptance of tribesmen should be                secured if possible, but you will  remember  difficulty which this caused                in case of Mohammerah, and negotiations should not be  allowed to                break down over this point.           &quot; 2. You are presumably prepared  for Sheikh of Koweit to ask for similar                guarantee when both Bin Saud and Sheikh of  Mohammerah have it.           &quot; 3. Pledge  against unprovoked aggression should be so worded as to make                His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  sole judges  of  nature  and  extent  of                assistance.           &quot;  4.  Please consider whether this  treaty should not contain clause binding                Bin Saud, subject to eventual  definition  of boundaries, not to interfere                with Koweit, Bahrein, al Katar, and Trucial  Chiefs.  But I  leave this to                your discretion.&quot;     On  the 6th February,  1915, the  Government of India  communicated  these instructions  to Sir P.  Cox  (30472/15 : No. 6),   and authorised him to  enter into negotiations with Bin Saud on the lines laid down, &quot; on the clear understanding that any treaty agreed upon is subject to the confirmation of the Government of India.&quot;     Accordingly, Sir P. Cox drafted  a treaty  in seven articles, the terms of  which (see 111069/15) may  be summarised at this point:      Article  1. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise  Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, al Hasa, Qatif,  and their ports on the Gulf Coast, and  his descendants after him, &quot; but the selection of the individual shall be subject  to the  approval of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;     Article  2. His Majesty&apos;s Government shall aid Bin Saud at their discretion in case of unprovoked aggression against him by  a foreign Power.     Article  3. Bin Saud  renounces diplomatic relations with  any foreign  Power other than His Majestys Government.     Article  4. Bin Saud will not cede, sell, or mortgage territory, or grant concessions to any foreign Power  or its subjects, without the&apos; consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government     Article  5.-Bin Saud will keep open the pilgrimage routes  through his territory to the Holy Places, and  will protect pilgrims.     Article 6. Bin Saud  will refrain from interference with Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Oman Coast,  and any other tribes and chiefs under His Majesty&apos;s Governments protection.     Article 7. A further detailed treaty shall  be concluded later.     About the same time (43530/15 : No. 14)  Bin Saud wrote to Sir P.  Cox, asking, in view of Captain Shakespear&apos;s death, either  that another officer should  be  deputed, or that negotiations should be continued by correspondence direct from Basra, and not via Koweit.     On the 24th February, 1915, in reporting this request to the Government of India, Sir P.  Cox made the following proposal :           &quot; I  would propose now  to send him draft treaty which was awaiting despatch     through Shakespear, together with Viceroy&apos;s letter.  In  doing so I would advise     him to sign it without delay, and say  that, as soon as it is completed, an officer can     then be  deputed to discuss details of second treaty.&quot;     The Government of India instructed Sir P. Cox to act as he proposed, and on the 28th February, 1915,  this was reported by the Viceroy to the India Office (24119/15).     Sir  P. Cox&apos;s draft  and the Viceroy&apos;s letter were accordingly forwarded to Bin Saud, and two  letters, both dated  the  24th April,  1915, and addressed  respectively to the Viceroy and  Sir P.  Cox, were eventually received  in reply  from Bin  Saud (111069/15).     In his letter to Sir  P. Cox, Bin Saud enclosed a signed copy oi the Arabic version of the treaty.  But, to quote his words          &quot; Certain modifications  (which are not  important)  were found necessary for     cogent reasons, necessitated by local  conditions, the need  to reassure  the inhabi-
     tants and  the governing  family of Bin Saud, and  also in view of  the knowledge     we possess as to the circumstances of the Arabs.&quot;     Sir Percy Gox  replied  to  Bin Saud  as follows in a  letter dated the  26th  June,1915:-           &quot;As regards  the treaty, I have understood what  you wrote, explaining that     you had  made certain modifications in the text.   I have not the  least  doubt that     we shall succeed in  adjusting the wording of the articles into a form which will     suit both parties and safeguard the interests of yourself and us ;  but, as the wording     was  different  to  what the Government  had  approved previously,  it  has been     necessary for me to refer it to them.&quot;     On the same date he forwarded to the Government of  India translations of his own and Bin Saud\s  drafts in parallel columns, adding a schedule of Bin Saud&apos;s alterations,and commenting upon them.   It may be convenient to set out the  two versions in thismemorandum:                 British draft.       In the name of God the Merciful and                Compassionate.   The High British Government on its  own part,and Abdul Aziz-bi-n-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal al-Saud,  Euler of  Najd,  Al  Hasa  and  Qatif,  onbehalf of himself, his  heirs and  successors andtribesmen,  being  desirous   of  confirming  and strengthening the  friendly  relations which have for generations existed  between the two parties,and with a view  to consolidating their respectiveinterests the British  Government have  namedand appointed Lieutenant-Colonel  Sir Percy Cox,K.C.I.E., C.S.I., British Resident in the persian gulf, as their Plenipotentiary to conclude a treaty for this purpose  with  Abclul  Aziz-bin-AbdurRahman-bin-Faisal al-Saud,The said  Lieutenant-Colonel Sir  Percy Cox, andAbdul Aziz-bin-Abdur   Rahman-bin-Faisal al-Saud, hereafter known as  &quot; Bin Saud,&quot; have agreedupon and concluded the following articles :              Bin Saud&apos;s draft.       In the name of God the Merciful and                Compassionate.   The High British  Government on its own  part,and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur  Rahman-bin-Faisalas-Saud, Ruler  of Najd, El  Hasa,  Qatif, Jubail,and the towns  and forts  belonginq to  them,  onbehalf of himself, his heirs and successors andtribesmen,  being desirous  of  confirming  and strengthening the friendly relations which  have for a long time existed between the two parties,and with a view to consolidating  their respectiveinterests the British  Government have namedand appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox,K.C.I.E., C.S.I., British Resident in the persian gulf, as their Plenipotentiary, to conclude a treaty for  this purpose  with  Abdul  Aziz-bin-AbdurRahman-bin-Faisal as-Saud,The said Lieutenant-Colonel  Sir Percy  Cox, andAbdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal as-Saud,hereafter known as &quot; Bin Saud,&quot; have agreed uponand concluded the following articles :   The British Government do acknowledge  andadmit that Najd, Al Hasa and Qatif,and their  territories and ports on  the  shores ofthe Persian Gulf are the  territory  of Bin Saudand  of his  fathers before him,  and do herebyrecognise the said Bin Saud as the independentRuler thereof,                 *and after  him his sons  and  descendants by in-heritance,  but the selection of  the individual shallbe subject to the approval of the British Government,after confidential consultation with them.I.   The British Government do acknowledge andadmit  that  Najd,  El Hasa,  Qatif, Mail,  theirdependencies  and territories, which will be discussed and determined hereafter, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are thecountries of  Bin  Saud and of his fathers before him and do hereby recognise the said Bin Saud asthe independent Ruler  thereof  and  as absoluteChief of their tribes,and after him his  sons  and   descendants  byinheritance,  but the selection of the individualshall  be according to the  designation of  his successor (by the living  Ruler)  or by the calling for the  votes of  the subjects  inhabiting   those:countries.II.  In the event of unprovoked aggression by  any foreign Power on the territories of the said BinSaud  and his descendants, the British Govern-ment  will aid Bin  Saud to such extent  and insuch manner as the situation may  seem to themto require.        [939jII.  In the event of           aggression  by any foreign Power on the territories of the countriesbelonging  to  the  said   Bin  Saud,  and  hisdescendants, the British Government will aid BinSaud in all circumstances and in any place.D
                    III.  Bin Saud hereby agrees and promises to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreementor Treaty with any Foreign Nation or  Power andfurther to give immediate notice to the  politicalauthorities  of  the British  Government  Of  anyattempt on  the  part  of  any  other  Power tointerfere with the above territories.

V.  Bin  Saud hereby  promises  to  keep open theToads leading through the  above territories  to the holy Places and to protect pilgrims on  their wayto and  from the said shrines.                    VI.  Bin Saud undertakes as his  fathers  did  before him to refrain from all aggression on, or  inter-ference with, the territories  of Kuwait, Bahrain,Qatar and Oman Coast, or other tribes and  Chiefswho  are  under the protection  of  the  BritishGovernment, and the limits of whose territoriesshall be hereafter determined.                     III.

VII.  The British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude  a further detailed Treaty in regard to matters jointly concerning the two parties.   (Signed)    ABDUL AZIZ-BIN-ABDUR  KAHMAN-                 BIN-FAISAL-BIN-SAUD.              (Seal  of Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur                 Bahman-bin-Faisal-bin-Saud.)     Sir P. Cox&apos;s letter and enclosures were received  by the Government of India  onthe 5th July,  1915, and  on the  7th July,  1915, the Viceroy telegraphed  as follows tothe India  Office :           &quot; We  have  carefully examined  modifications proposed by Bin Saud  in  the     preliminary treaty sent to him by Cox for acceptance.   These modifications  are  for     the most part unimportant.   Important modifications are             &quot;In article  1,  he omits words &apos;subject  to  approval of British  Government     after consultation with them&apos; in regard to selection of successor.   Cox thinks that     Bin Saud will accept our wording or some other suitable  phrase when  our motive     is explained.    If, however,  he refuses, we think we might give way on this point.           &quot; Article 2,  as modified by Bin Saud, reads :  &apos; In the event of aggression  by     any foreign Power  on territories  of countries belonging  to the  said Bin Saud and     his descendants,  British Government will  aid  Bin Saud in all circumstances and in     any place,&apos; thus  omitting the word &apos; unprovoked,&apos; and  entirely altering the words     &apos;to such extent and,in such manner  as situation may seem  to them  to require.&apos;     We think word &apos; unprovoked&apos; or  some similar term should be inserted, and would     suggest words &apos; to such extent and in such manner as may be expedient,&apos; in place     of Bin Saud&apos;s suggestion.
          &quot; In article 4, he adds that he will follow the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-     raent &apos; where his interests require it.&apos;   Cox suggests &apos; where  his interests are not     injured thereby,&apos; and this seems unobjectionable.          &quot; Cox proposes to arrange a meeting shortly with Bin Saud to adjust differences.     We think he should be authorised to do so, and to negotiate a treaty on lines above     indicated, subject to ratification by Government of India.&quot;     On the 11th August, 1915, the  India Office communicated  to the Foreign Office copies of this telegram and  of the  documents received from Sir P. Cox, and submitted a draft telegram of  instructions to the Viceroy.     In their covering letter  explaining the  grounds of the instructions proposed in this draft, the India Office laid  particular stress upon  Bin  Saud&apos;s omission of the words &quot; subject to the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot; at the end of article 1 :           &quot; It is ordinarily the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognise only the     de facto ruler, and to avoid giving dynastic  guarantees; and the rare exceptions     which they have made have been in cases such  as that of  Mohammerah where     their relations with the ruler have been of long  standing, and where the responsi-     bilities undertaken are limited.   Neither of these conditions is  present in the case     of Bin Saud, and Mr. Chamberlain therefore hopes that Sir P. Cox may be able to     obtain  the restoration of the words.  Those which Bin Saud  proposes to substitute     are apparently  intended to provide for  the  constitutional election  of a successor in     a case  where the ruler has failed to designate during his lifetime.   There seems to     be no objection  to such  a provision, so long as the method of election is  practicable,     but it docs not  appear how in such a case His Majesty&apos;s Government are  to ensure     that  only a person  agreeable to themselves shall be  elected.  Since, however, a     person  elected by a tribal majority would probably have no difficulty in maintaining     himself as de facto ruler, if the  election had been conducted by a method recognised     by the  tribes themselves to be valid, undesirable complications are perhaps unlikely     to arise.&quot;     The draft was concurred in by the Foreign Office, and the following telegram was accordingly despatched by the India  Office to  the Viceroy on  the 16th August,  1915(111069/15  and 116544/15):-         &quot; Article 1 of treaty.  Cox, after suitable explanation, should  press for  resto-     ration   of  original words,  to  which  His Majestys  Government  attach  great     importance.   There seems no objection to election&apos;5&apos; in default of designation, pro-     vided method of election is practicable and recognised  as valid according to Arab     custom  by all tribes concerned.   Otherwise we may become involved in inter-tribal     disputes.         &quot; Article 2. &apos; Unprovoked &apos; should  be restored.  His Majesty&apos;s Government do     not like leaving ambiguity as  to  their aid, and if Bin Saud will not  agree to     original words they would prefer &apos; to such extent and in such manner as British     Government  after consultation with Bin  Saud  may  consider most effective for     protecting&apos;his interests.&apos;         &quot; Article 4. Cox should secure omission of Bin Saud&apos;s addition if  possible;  if     not, substitution of his own proposal.         &quot; As regards other  alterations he should exercise his discretion.&quot;     On the 18th August,  1915, the Government of India communicated the telegraphic correspondence that  had passed between the Viceroy and the India Office to Sir P. Cox,and authorised  him (141285/15) to  arrange a meeting with Bin Saud, as he might think  advisable,  and negotiate  further on these lines, on the understanding that  atreaty, if concluded, would be subject to ratification by the Government of India.     Accordingly, Sir P. Cox resumed negotiations, and concluded a definite  treaty withBin Saud, on the 26th December, 1915 (201630/15).     In a letter  dated  the  3rd January, 1916 (38086/4650/16),  he forwarded  to theGovernment of India a translation of the treaty as signed, and also set out  the text ofthis and of the original British draft (both in translation) in parallel columns,  with the alterations marked, and with comments on  each alteration, explaining how it arose and    * For the words in the British  draft of  article 1 which the Viceroy quoted in his telegram of the 7thJuly, 191-5,  Bin Saud had substituted &quot;by  the living ruler or by calling for  the votes of the  subjectsinhabiting those countries.&quot;
 what its effect would be.   A copy of the text signed on this occasion, and subsequently ratified, is printed at the end of the present memorandum, and the passages that differ from the original draft (printed on pp.  9-10 above) are there done into italics.     Copies of this text, and of Sir P.  Cox&apos;s comments, were transmitted by letter to the India Office on the 21st January, 1916, and on the 8th February, 1916, the Viceroy telegraphed to the  India Office (26095/16) that the  Government of India proposed to ratify the treaty in this form if the India Office saw no objection.     This proposal  was approved  by the India Office, with the concurrence  of  the Foreign Office, in a telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 6th March, 1916 (40708/1.5  and 67554/15).   On the 10th March, 1916, the Government of  India wrote accordingly to Sir P. Cox (71652/16), returning him the two original copies of the treaty  signed by himself and Bin Saud, and attaching parchment copies of the English translation, with instructions that the Arabic version should be written in on the  margin of these, and that they should then likewise be signed  by Sir P. Cox and Bin Saud.     These instructions appear to  have  been  carried out, and the  parchment copies returned in due course to India.  The treaty was eventually ratified by the Government of India on the 18th July,  1916 (174647/16).     Shortly after this,  Sherif Husein, with  whom His Majesty&apos;s Government had entered into relations in the latter part of  1.915, wrote  to Bin Saud asking for &quot; alliance &quot; and &quot; assistance ;&quot; and Bin Saud reported this to Sir P. Cox, recalling former aggressions by the  Sherif on his (Bin Saud&apos;s) territories and  tribes, and expressing  mistrust of  the Sherit&apos;s intentions.    (See Memorandum  on British  Commitments , to  King Husein, Section (vii)).     In view  of this, Sir P. Cox submitted on the 8th September,  1916, that  Bin Saud &quot; should be informed definitely that no present or future understandings between us and the Sherif would prejudice our  adherence  to the terms  of Articles 1 and 2 of  our treaty with him of the 26th December,  1915.&quot;   And  he  also  suggested that  the terms of this treaty  might be communicated to the Sherif (180581/16).     In regard to the first of these proposals, the India  Office, with  the concurrence of the Foreign Office (183325/16), telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 19th September, 1916 (191509/16),  informing him that &quot;as  the policy of encouraging an  Arab State or Confederation of  States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,&quot; and instructing him that &quot; reference to the treaty should be confined to Article 1, as we could not admit that Article 2 was binding on us as against other Arabs.&quot;     These instructions appear to  have been carried out by Sir P. Cox in the form of a verbal assurance to  Bin Saud  on the occasion  of  a  durbar  held  at  Koweit on  the 21st November, 1916, at which Bin Saud was decorated by him with  the K.C.I.E. in the presence of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah  (235981/16  and 236884/16).     The terms of the treaty of the  26th December, 1915, were also communicated to King Husein in due course (see Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, Section (vii)), in accordance with Sir P. Cox&apos;s suggestion. Relation of Commitments to Bin Saud to British Desiderata.     In considering the bearing of this treaty with Bin Saud upon  British  desiderata, it has to be remembered that it was intentionally confined  to immediate essentials ; that important  questions like the regulation  of the  arms traffic and  the status of British nationals in  Bin Saud&apos;s territory  (brought  up by Bin  Saud  himself), or, again, the binding over  of  Bin Saud  to  keep the peace at sea in the Gulf (brought up by Sir P. Cox) were postponed  for later consideration by the consensus of the  Government of India and  the India Office; that  article  7  provides for the conclusion of a detailed treaty hereafter ; and that Bin Saud rather than His Majesty&apos;s Government has pressed that this should be carried out at an early date.     In examining   the present  treaty,  therefore,  little  account need  be taken of omissions.  Yet it  may be  pointed  out that,  even as the treaty stands, it contains all the elements  of a true  trucial treaty.  These elements are (a) the right and obligation of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government to arbitrate in case of disputes between the other party to  the  treaty and his  neighbours, who are bound by similar treaties to His Majesty&apos;s Government;  (6)  tie renunciation by the  other party of any relations with foreign Powers except through His Majesty&apos;s  Government; and (c) a promise on the part of the other party not to alienate  territory to a foreign Power except with His  Majesty&apos;s Government^ consent.     Of these essential elements, (b) and (c) are explicitly  embodied in articles 3 and 4respectively ; while (a), though nowhere set out in terms, would appear to he coveredsatisfactorily by article 2 and the last clause in article 4.
      This treaty,  therefore,  although it  was  never intended to be exhaustive,  is on sounder  lines  than our treaty with the Idrisi or our more informal arrangements with King Husein, and there ought to be considerably less difficulty  in expanding it,  when the time comes, into a definitive treaty settling our relations with Bin Saud in detail.      There are, however, several  positive points  affecting British desiderata to which the present treaty appears to commit us :- (1.) Demarcation of Territories.      In article 1 we recognise Bin Saud  as independent  ruler of certain enumerated countries &quot; and their  dependencies and  territories, which will be discussed and deter- mined hereafter.&quot;      This is less explicit than our undertaking to the  Itlrisi (article 6 of Idrisi  Treaty, for which see Memorandum on  British Commitments to the Idrisi), in which we under- take &quot; at the conclusion of the war to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya, or any other rival.&quot;      But in effect it commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Bin Saud and  King Husein, and in the last resort to impose an  effective sanction for our award. (2.) Keeping of the Peace.     In  the original trucial  treaties with  the Independent Chiefs of &quot; Trucial Oman,&quot; His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments rights and obligations were strictly limited to the main- tpnance of peace at sea, and we did not attempt to control the mutual relations on land of the Arab parties to this series of treaties.     This formula set a very desirable limit to  His Majesty&apos;s Governments liabilities, while covering most of the causes of strife between the local Arab rulers.  The  trucial chiefs of Oman hold sway in a narrow strip of territory  between the sea  and an uninhabited desert.   The activities of their subjects are almost  wholly maritime, and there are no nomadic tribes in their area of jurisdiction to create difficulties of allegiance and demarcation.     But  it is evident that if  the British trucial system, hitherto confined to  the fringe between the south  and east coasts and the great south-eastern desert, is to be extended, as it has been extended  during the war, to  the remainder  of the Peninsula, we  shall have to keep the peace between rulers whose prosperity depends,  not upon the coasting trade or the pearl fisheries, but upon the command of inland oases and Bedouin tribes.     Bin Saud, the Idrisi, and King Husein, with whom we have entered into relations during the war, are  rulers of this latter kind.  A &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, valuable and indeed indispensable as it is,  will do comparatively little to  remove the causes of friction between  them, or to enable  His Majesty&apos;s Government to deal effectively with such friction when it arises.     If we are to keep the peace between them, we shall be driven eventually to  control their relations with one another by land.   To  a certain extent this  may be done  by a maritime  blockade.   But apart from the fact that, where political  authority is as lax as it is in Arabia, it is difficult to blockade  one State effectively without blockading the whole Peninsula,^ it is in the nature of things more difficult to bring pressure to  bear on Hail or Er-Riadh by this method than on  Sharjah, or even Maskat.   Besides  this, our new Arab Allies are considerably more powerful than most of the Arab rulers who have previously entered into a trucial relationship with  us.  And in the case of King Husein, who is likely to be the most troublesome of all over his relations with his neighbours, it is peculiarly difficult for  His Majesty&apos;s  Government to exert pressure, whether by blockade or otherwise, owing to the sanctity of his territory in the eyes of the Moslem world, and the traffic of pilgrims between his ports and every other Moslem country.     The keeping of the peace on land thus appears to be the crucial problem in  that extension of the British trucial system over the remainder of the  Arabian Peninsula, which has been carried a long way towards completion during the  war.     The Treaty with Bin. Saud is our first experiment in this more highly-developed and difficult form of trucial relationship, and in their ruling on the Treaty a short  time after its ratification (see above), the Iudia Office laid down the important  doctrine  that &quot; we cannot admit that Article 2 is binding on  us as against other Arabs.&quot;    On this ruling, our obligations to Bin Saud by land would be confined to securinghim  against aggression on the  part of some outside Power (e.g., Turkey,  Persia,            * This seems a fair induction from our experiences during the war at Koweit.       [939]                                           &apos;                  E
Germany, Russia, France).  But  it may  perhaps be doubted whether our admittedobligations,  under Article  1, regarding the  demarcation of his  territories would  not commit us to active intervention  against any other Arab  ruler, such as King Husein,who might resort to force to reverse our award.     It  would appear desirable that, on this  question, which affects all our new Arabrelationships, a clear line of policy  should be determined upon.(3.)  Dynastic Guarantee.     In concluding a trucial treaty with an Arab ruler, it has  not  been His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ custom to  recognise it as binding them to  his  descendants.  But it is evident that it  would have been difficult to avoid doing so  ultimately in cases in which our  relationship had  lasted over  a  long  period, or in which  the  dynasty was frimly established and possessed prestige.     The dynastic guarantee accorded to Bin Saud in Article 2 of the  present Treatymerely follows a precedent already set  in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (seeMemorandum on British  Commitments to  the Gulf Chiefs), and it is hedged round withreservations.     This would not appear to be so crucial a question as  that of keeping the peace on land, but the history of our relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Katar shows thata dynastic guarantee  might prove awkward in certain  cases,  and that the precedent.should not too readily be made into a general rule.
APPENDIX.                    TEXT  OF  THE TREATY  OF  DECEMBER  26,  1915.                         In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.                                            Preamble.     THE High British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-FaisalAl-Saud, Ruler of Najd, El  Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and the towns and ports  belonging  to  them, onbehalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which  have for a long time  existed  between  the two parties, and with a viewto consolidating  their  respective interests the  British Government  have named  and appointedLieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy  Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., British Resident in the  Persian Gulf, as theirPlenipotentiary, to conclude a treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-FaisalAl-Saud.     The said  Lieutenant-Colonel  Sir Percy Cox and Abdul  Aziz-bin-Abdur  Rahman-bin-FaisalAl-Saud (hereafter known as &quot;Bin Saud&quot;), have agreed upon and concluded the  following articles:                                                 I.     The British Government do acknowledge and admit that  Najd, El  Hassa, Qatif and  Jubail, and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and determined hereafter, and their ports on the shores  of the Persian Gulf are the countries of Bin Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Bin Saud as the independent Ruler thereof and absolute  Chief of their tribes, and after him  his sons and descendants by inheritance; but the selection of the individual shall be in accordance with  the nomination (i.e., by the living Ruler) of his  successor;  bid with the proviso that he shall not be a person antagonistic to the British  Government in any  respect; such as, for example, in regard to the terms mentioned in this treaty.                                               II.     In  the  event of [&quot; unprovoked &quot; omitted] aggression  by any foreign Power on the territories of the countries of the said  Bin Saud and  his descendants without refevence to the British Government and without giving her an opportunity  of  communicating with  Bin Saud  and composing the matter, the British Government will aid Bin Saud to such extent and in  such a manner as the British Govern- ment after consulting Bin Saud may consider most effective for protecting his interests and countries.                                              III.     Bin Saud hereby  agrees and promises to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign  nation or Power, and, further,  to give  immediate notice to the political authorities of the British Government of any attempt on the part of any other Power to interfere with the above territories.                                              IV.     Bin Saud hereby undertakes that  he  will  absolutely not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the above territories or any part of them, or grant concessions within  those territories to any  foreign  Power or to the subjects  of any foreign Power,*  without the consent of the British Government.     And that he will follow her advice unreservedly provided that it be not damaging to his own interests.                                               V.     Bin Saud hereby undertakes to keep  open within his territories  the roads  leading  to the Holy Places, and to protect pilgrims on their passage to and from the  Holy Places.    * The words &quot; or the  subjects of any foreign Power &quot; were accidentally omitted  in the copies signed by Sir P. Cox and Bin Saud on  the 26th December, 1915.  Sir  P. Cox  drew Bin Saud&apos;s attention to  this omission  in a letter dated  the  27th December, 1915 (38086/16), and added :  &quot; I have duly written them in the text of the original document which I am submitting  to Government, and Government will consider it in this form ;  so that if  the same mistake occurs in the copy with you, I trust you will add the words abovequoted.&quot;
                                             VI.    Bin Saud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression  on or interfer-ence with the territories  of Kuwait, Bahrein,  and of the Sheikhs of Qatar and  the  Oman Coast[&quot; other tribes and chiefs &quot; omitted], who are under  the protection  of  the British Government; and whohave treaty relations with the  said Government;  and the limits of their territories shall  be hereafterdetermined.                                            VII.    The  British Government and  Bin Saud  agree  to conclude [words in original draft omitted&apos;] afurther detailed treaty in regard to  [word  omitted] matters concerning the two parties.    Dated 18th  Safar 1334,  corresponding to 26th December,  1915.                          - (Signed and sealed)    ABDUL AZIZ AL-SAUD.                                                  P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel,                                                          British Resident in the Persian Gulf.                                      (Signed)    CHELMSFOED,                                                       Viceroy anal Governor-General of India.    This treaty was ratified  by the Viceroy and Governor-General  of India in Council  at Simla, onthe 18th  day of July, 1916 A.D.                                      (Signed)    A. H. GEANT,                                                          Secretary to the Government of India,                                                            Foreign and Political Department.o
