^at/jt^o      168SECRET.(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestyfs Government.) DESPATCH D. 3.B 8Q ffOM jmiGADIER-GENERAL A.  KtfOX, MILITARY ATTACHE.v-5l;&apos;^5l,i^&apos;::   SUBJECT: SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT.British Embassy, Petrograd, 10^ August, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to send some notes on the situation as regards supply and transport.At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Sovyet on the 1st August, the Minister of Supply, Pyeshekhodov, spoke of the economic state of the country.He said that in May the position was very bad. The army had only supplies for a few days. In Moscow there was at one time grain for one day only, and in Petrograd the position was little better. . The situation has improved. The army has from 20 days to l  months&apos; supply, Petrograd has 20 days&apos; and Moscow 14.:The future is threatening. The chief difficulty arises from the disorganization of the railways, which may cause a disaster in the autumn. It is impossible to depend on railways only for the feeding of northern Russia. Food must be carried by the waterways. The idea, however, of carrying grain to the Volga by rail, transferring to lighters for conveyance to the north, and transferring later to railway cars is largely checkmated by the exorbitant wages demanded by dock labourers, wages which make it possible for them to work, not 8 hours a day, but far less.The Government depended formerly for army supply on the landlords&apos; crops, which were easily collected. Landlords&apos; sowings have decreased on account of interference by the peasants, The peasants try, too, to prevent the use of-harvest machinery. They demand that they should reap the harvest at a wage of \ to -grd of the crop in kind. This means that a large part of the landlords&apos; crops will be scattered through peasants&apos; cottages, and its collection by the Government will be impossible.The peasant population of several Governments refuse to give their grain except in return for manufactured goods. The villages in south-west Russia lack cloth and metal ware. The Ministry of Supply is making heroic efforts to find material to barter, but manufactured material is almost unobtainable in Russia, and limitations of tonnage prevents its import. Even when some material has been collected, its distribution in the prevailing disorder is not a simple matter. Six hundred wagons of stuff were lately despatched for bartering in the Caucasus, but 400 have been &quot;arrested&quot; at Taganrog, and the local committees demand the distribution of the contents on the spot.The sugar output will be much reduced, as the peasants have taken over by force part of the beetroot estates.The peasants do all they can to hold back their grain in the hope that the prices, which are at present low, may be raised. There are no Government store houses along the railways, and supplies have to be railed on immediately they are brought in. The delivery to rail head is a problem in itself. Horse requisition has been overdone. There is no mechanical transport. There are practically no metalled roads in the grain-bearing districts, and the tracts are often impassable in spring and autumn. Just now such means of transport as the peasant possesses are engaged in the actual harvesting and no grain is being delivered to railhead. Horse drawn transport is so limited that grain cannot be conveyed from long distances. In fact it amounts to this that the army and the town population of Russia have to depend for their existance on a narrow strip some 15 miles wide on either side of the railways.A good harvest is of vital importance, for though there is always grain enough to feed the population, we require a surplus within transportable distance.The harvest of 1917 is barely fair. The yield of rye is average. Wheat is good in the Northern Caucasus and in &quot;Western Siberia, but unfortunately only middling in the Volga Governments whence it can be easily carried.   Oats and barley are not good.The problem the Ministry of Supply has now to solve is the conveyance of as much grain as possible of the Northern Caucasus crop by water to the upper Volga before river transport stops.   The Volga tonnage 4j millions-is sufficient, but the last barge(B17/564)  25  9/17  1I&amp;S  5006wo
must leave the lower river by the 23rd September, so time is short, and the selfish laziness of the dock labourers referred to above is likely to prove a decisive factor. At the end of next month it mil be possible to estimate the effort demanded from the Russian railways in the winter.The position now is of course worse than it was at this time last year. The Chief Intendant told me that he always tried to keep a reserve of two months on the front and that he had succeeded up to November, 1916, when the reserve began to fall gradually till at one time in February there were only a very few days&apos; left.The Assistant Minister of Supplies told me that the reserve of food at the front is now 20 to 30 days as compared with 60 days at this time last year. In Moscow and Petrograd there are 20 days as compared with 45 in August last year. These figures differ from those given publicly by the Minister of Supply on the same day.The Department of Military Communication shows that the precedence is always given to food supplies for the army and everything obtained from the Ministry of Supply is sent on without delajr.For purposes of army supply Russia is divided into an &quot; Eastern&quot; and a Western &quot; Region.   The dividing line is rather east of the general line Pelrograd-Odessa, the handing over stations being Petrograd, Bologoe, Rjev, Smolensk, Bryansk, Gomel, Kiev, Znamenka, Nikolaev and Odessa.Every few months a conference at General Headquarters settles the number of wagons of each article that the Eastern Region is required to supply to each front. The southern fronts are of course more self supporting than the others. The daily supply *of wagons of food only was fixed for July as follows : Northern Front      ...   561 South-west Front   ...   355Western    ,, ...   589 Roumanian ...   102The problem is more difficult in winter when on an average 800 wagons are required daily for hay and 400 for oats and barley. In Febuary the number of wagons required was : Northern Front      ...   660 South - western   and   687Western    ,, ...   893 Rumanian Fronts.General Headquarters asked the Eastern Region for 51,612 wagons in March, but owing to the non-delivery of supplies at entraining stations, only 32,448 wagons were loaded a shortage of 37&apos;1 per cent.Things were worse in April.   Out of 45,900 wagons asked for only 12,821 were loaded a deficit of 72 per cent.In the first half of May and June the deficit amounted to 21 per cent.Raihvays. The Chief of Railway Communications showed me some days ago a short paper he hod prepared to wake the Chief of General Staff up to the really serious condition of the railways.   The paper spoke of the situation as &quot; desperate.&quot;The average number of wagons loaded daily : During the first 6 months of 1916 was ......   37,200of 1917 was ......   31,800Leaving a daily deficit of   ............    5,400The following table shows the total number of engines and wagons in the month of June in 19&apos;16 and 1917 and the number out of those totals that were fit for work : 	Total number.		Number (it.		June, 191C.	June, 1917.	June, 1916.	June, 1917.Engines    .... Wagons	19,775 511,755	20,886 574,486	16.217 488,027	15,666 528,520The number of sick engines has therefore increased in the 12 months from 3,558 to 5,220, and the position has become worse in spite of the Government having obtained 1,100 new engines.The percentage of&quot; locomotives under repair rises each week by *2. One line has 52 per cent, of its engines laid up. Even these figures give an optimistic impression, for the engines on many lines are being worked to a finish.
169The workmen in the repair shops do not work. For instance, 50 per cent, of the boilermakers are constantly attending meetings, and generally some 6,000 men are constantly absent from their work for the same reason. In June the average man worked 14 6-hour days !Only once in the past 1\ years have the railways had a reserve of coal sufficient for one month&apos;s working. In. February last the coal reserve was on an average less than sufficient for one week, and on one line at all events there was fuel for a few hours only. If the reserve - is at ^present slightly greater, the accumulation is at the expense of industry, which is being starved.The railway employees have a certain ground for complaint, for they were badly paid under the old regime. The train personnel has worked since the Revolution under impossible conditions. Guchkovs concession of leave to 5 per cent, of the soldiers up to 40 years of age, and to 15 per cent, of those over that age, means that the trains are constantly stormed by crowds of indisciplined soldiery. They crowd on the roofs, and their special delight is to ease themselves through the ventilators if there are &quot; bourgeois &quot; in the compartment below. They make short work of any railway official who ventures to interfere. The madness of electing chiefs has, of course, penetrated to the railway department. Many of the directors have been dismissed by the men. A conference of railway employees now sitting at Moscow has decided to abolish the Ministry of Ways and to rule the railways by a committee elected by the men.Some Russians try to be optimistic. They say that the winter of 1916-1917, which almost caused a breakdown of the railways in February, was the severest for 50 years. With ordinary luck next winter should be less strain on the engines. The Baltic and Black Sea shipping works are reducing their programmes and some of their skilled hands will be transferred to the railway repair shops.The American Railway Mission has been in Russia several weeks, but has not so far accomplished much owing to the prevailing rjolitical confusion. Its Chief, Mr. Stevens, holds that the carrying capacity of the Russian railways would be increased by 40 per cent, if his recommendations for improvements in exploitation were adopted. His idea is briefly to send the engines on longer runs. Some Russians agree. Others point out that longer runs will mean longer working hours for the personnel, who cannot be tempted by increased wages or premia, money having lost much of its attraction since nothing can be purchased, or else the drivers must work in reliefs and that requires the provision of accommodation at many stations that are now without it.All the American Mission has accomplished is to obtain a half-hearted invitation from the Russian Government to send a &quot; unit&quot; of 84 traffic officials to try their methods of exploitation on some 2,000 versts of line in Western Siberia. The Mission generally is rather disgusted with its reception here and those of its members who have important posts in Ajnerica are anxious to return to them as soon as possible. The Mission generally fails to understand Russian methods. It should be helped to force its reforms on the Russian Government as a necessary condition to the grant of financial or other material assistance. The Allies should force Russia to hand over the whole superior management of the Siberian Railway from Vladivostok westwards to American hands. The Americans should send what engines they can spare at once. The conveyance of the 700,000 tons of material accumulated at Vladivostok to European Russia might give the Government something to barter with and might induce the peasants to give up their grain.Of course the first requirement is the re-establishment of discipline. If this is not done no power on earth will save Russia from catastrophe. The only doubt is whether the crash will come in the autumn or in the winter.The financial position is impossible. No one pays any taxes. The Provisional&apos; Government assigns money right and left to every talking committee it has reason to fear regardless of the state of the Treasury. The remedy is simple enough. The Government printing press produces paper money up to the utmost capacity of its machinery. It turned out 35 Rs. millions a day in May and now produces 55 Rs. millions.   The number of employees which was at one time 700, has risen to 8,000.General Situation.Petrograd is outwardly quiet. There have been no cases of general shooting for just over three weeks. On the other hand there is no sign whatever of the garrison having been taken in hand. Sentries sit and smoke as before. No one trains except the women; they train all day while the garrison watches them and eats sunflower(6006)
seeds. The men are rapidly deteriorating from idleness. Only a few of the energetic ones earn high wages unloading wood from barges on the Neva for private contractors.Vasilovski, the young general of 37, who has succeeded Polovtsev in command of the Petrograd Military District is a fine soldier. His friends prophesy that he will not last more than a few weeks for he is too straight to work with politicians.Kerenski has formed a Government. No one believes in it very much, but its members believe in Kerenski.Guchkov has returned to Petrograd after taking part in the retreat with the 3rd Caucasian Cossack Cavalry Division. He thinks there will be another Bolshevik rising. This may be suppressed, but it will be followed in a month&apos;s time by bread riots and a massacre of the bourgeois.   Then there will be a military dictator.The Government is in mortal fear of a counter revolution. A few people who wished to restore order looked to Kolchak. late commander of the Black Sea Fleet, as a possible leader, but Kerenski has appointed him chief of the Russian naval mission to the United States and has shown indecent anxiety to hasten his departure. Then others thought of Gurko, but he is now confined in Peter and Paul. As a Eussian officer said to me the other day : &quot; The worst of us Russians is that we always talk ten times as much as we act.&quot;In the last three weeks Kerenski has missed a great chance of restoring order in Petrograd and there will be no order anywhere till it is restored here. As Minister of War he has had no strong assistant. Manikovski, who is in charge of all the supply departments, is in despair. He has not been able to see Kerenski for over 2 months. He described his state of mind yesterday by saying: &quot; Sometimes I want - to put a bullet into my own head and sometimes into some one else&apos;s.&quot; His subordinate, the Chief of the Military Technical Department, says there is no real work being done in his office. I asked officers in the Artillery Directorate why they had so much time to spare, and they said that productive work had fallen generally 50 per cent, in Russia since the Revolution and they were doing their best to follow the times.The other two Assistant Ministers of War, Yakubovich and Tumanov, Manikovski speaks of as his &quot; Nursery.&quot; Other officers consider them &quot; Carrierists.&quot; They both agree when one presses the necessity for strong measures, but they probably also agree with Kerenski when he preaches caution. When I showed Tumanov the other day some of the figures repeated in this report and pointed out that they seemed to indicate disaster in a very few months, he had nothing better to reply than that I had forgotten the &quot; wonderful spirit of the Russian people.&quot; If we have only this &quot; wonderful spirit&quot; to depend upon, 1 am afraid we are lost indeed.I spoke to Tumanov of the disgraceful scenes in Tarnopol and Kalushch. In the latter town two drunken regiments behaved in a way that Kurds would be ashamed of. Very few of the population of either sex or any age escaped. Ruthenes, Poles and Jews suffered alike. Forty to 50 men in turn outraged old women of 70 or little girls. Tumanov said that the Russian was good natured except when in diink or in panic.   The worst of it is that he is always now in panic or in drink.No one knows what the officers have suffered since the revolution. They have played up like men and have proved themselves to be the best people in Russia. Whatever bitterness we Allies may feel against the Russian Government which lias allowed itself to be stampeded by the emigrants, the corps of officers deserves nothing but our sympathy.Hundreds of them sacrificed themselves in trying to give their men a lead in the offensive of July.   Many have been shot from behind by their own men.Few if any of the murderers have been punished. Recently near Riga two companies which had been ordered to go to the trenches, marched to the divisional headquarters and asked to see the commander. When he came out to greet the men he was at once shot dead. The companies then marched away. They have since denied all knowledge of the murderer and have remained unpunished.Kerenski and his satellites have known the sort of thing that has been going on but they have never stood up for the officers as they should. They have deliberately sacrificed them in order to gain political popularity. Even now their orders and proclamations always speak of the soldiers and officers. Yakubovich says this is a trifle but it shows the attitude.Kerenski is still the only individual that has any hold on the people, but the nation is doomed if its 180 millions cannot produce a bigger man. He has got the theatrical qualities of a Napoleon but none of his moral courage or useful ruthlessness. He sits in the Emperor&apos;s sitting room at the Winter Palace and sleeps in Alexander III.&apos;s bed. He drives in Nikolas JTs Roils Royce.   He still dreams childishly of a peace with
Germany by consent, The editor of the official military paper told me the other day that he wanted to publish some reports received from two returned Russian doctors, illustrative of the treatment of Russian prisoners in Germany. Kerenski said he was &quot;not to &quot; worry the Germans too much.&quot;After the rising of the 16th and 17th. July, Polovtsev, then Comrnander-in-Chief of the District, received a cipher telegram from Kerenski telling him to line the streets from the Station to the Winter Palace with the loyal troops. The idea was that the little socialist minister might thank them as he drove past in triumph to the Palace. The order was issued and instantly became known in the Sovyet where it caused no small commotion. The Minister of Labour, Skobelev, hurried to the District Staff to implore Polovtsev to cancel an order that he thought he had issued merely to c/Jjry favour with his chief. When he was shown the telegram he drove at once to the Council of Ministers and whispered the news to Tseretelli who was beside himself, for he sees a Napoleon arising from every bush to destroy the &quot; beautiful fabric of the revolution.&quot; At length Prince Lvov wrote across the telegram &quot; these instructions are not to be carried out,&quot; and the situation was saved.The chief hope now is that Kornilov may be given a free hand. He is able and has a strong character and is an undoubted patriot.The revolutionary Savinkov, who organized the murder of the Grand Duke Serge in Moscow and who has been commissary of the 7th Army for some months, has been appointed Assistant Minister of War and of Marine under Kerenski.In the conference of the night of the 3rd August, Savinkov spoke out his mind. He blamed the Provisional Government and the Sovyet for the disorganization of the army : &quot; They tried to instil discipline by words and not bydeeds. . . . When the front was broken the army was sent 5 sets of instructions and 60 propagandists. . . . The army can be made fit for war by one means only, there must be a strong revolutionary power, there must be a government that will act with decision and without hesitation, that will clear out without pity at once commanders who are unfit for their position, and all the disorganizing elements in the army by whatever name they may call themselves.&quot;%&apos; A summarised translation of the speeches of soldier representatives of armies is attached. These speeches were delivered at a recent meeting of the Sovyet, and are interesting as showing how little, even the better educated among the men, understand the real cause of the present disasters.I have, &amp;c,ALFRED KNOX, Brig.-General, Military Attache.
