August 1917.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 14.Week ending 26th August.There are no important movements of any of the Enemy main fleets to record.Enemy submarine activity during the week        .............Aligned lias been normal.   Onthe 26th August about 29 enemy submarines are believed to have been operating, their distribution being as follows : North Sea      ..      ..      ..     -.. .. .. .. .. 8English Channel      ..      ..      .. .. .. .. .. 2Approach routes to English Channel .. .. .. .. 3Atlantic         ..      ..      ..      .&apos;. .. .. .. .. 11Mediterranean         ..      ;.      .. .. .. .. .. 5White Sea      ..       ..       ..       .. .. .. .. .. 015 to 16 of these were large boats, of which 11 have apparently been operating to the West of the British Islands ; the chief areas of activity being the Approaches to the English Channel and to the North of Ireland. In the latter locality the enemy&apos;s present policy seems to be to work close in to the North Channel. The absence of reports from the South West of Ireland is still most marked, none having been received during the period under review; but this is clearly attributable to the small number of ships using this route.The Appendix shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings, and of losses by submarine and mine, of British Merchant Steamships for the week ended August 25th. For this period the total number of tons sunk is 107,631 (a sixth of this is accounted for by the sinking of two big ships while assembling for convoy), as compared with 58,515 tons last week. The percentage sunk of the total tonnage that sailed, excluding coasting traffic, is 4&apos;2, as compared with 2 &quot;08 last week.The figures for this week given in the following table show that, while there has been an increase on last week in the numbers and tonnage of British ships lost, Allied and Neutral losses are again reduced, being less than one-half of last \veek&apos;s losses.Numbee op Ships Sunk by Submarine and Mines.

Convoys.771 ships have been convoyed this week as compared with 710 last week. 6 of these were lost, as against 3 last week.

There have been two ships lost in convoy outwards this week-a percentage of -22 of the total convoyed.A convoy was attacked near Lough SwiUy while being assembled. The convoying armed merchant cruiser &quot; Virginian &quot; was torpedoed, but returned to harbour; 2 large ships were sunk, and 17 other steamers were held up at Lough Swilly to wait for escort.. This affair points to the difficulty of assembling convoys in waters where submarine attacks are likely. The possible disadvantages of Lough Swilly as a collecting port were fully realised, and its use was only a temporary measure pending the provision of the necessary defence for Lamlash, which port is now ready and being used.In Home Waters enemy submarines are reported to have been engaged by His Majesty&apos;s ships on 23 occasions this week : 5 by Destroyers, 1 by a Special Service Ship, 7 by Auxiliary Patrol Craft. 4 by Aircraft, and 6 by Merchant Vessels. Two of the Auxiliary Patrol Craft, 2 of the Aircraft and 1 of the Merchant Ships were French. In one case it is known that the submarine was destroyed.Akming of Merchant Ships.During the week ended 18th August, 61 more Merchant Vessels were armed for defence, but the losses and withdrawals were 23 8 more than the previous week.The increase in the number of vessels fitted to take a gun was 34, bringing the total to 3,778. The number of guns available increased from 2,678 to 2,716.The state of orders and deliveries of Naval Howitzers and Bomb Throwers is as follows: Description.	No. Ordered.

It is the common interest of the Nations united in war witli Germany that new tonnage should be of such character as to secure the maximum imports in a given time, and should be produced as rapidby as possible, consistent with this requirement.2. It is the common interest of such Nations to economise transport by using to their fullest extent those shipyards which are nearest to supplies of coal and steel, before sending coal and steel to shipyards more remote from sources of supply.3. Each such Nation shall appoint one representative, with technical assistance, to consider, from time to time, such questions as may arise in promoting the common interests enunciated above, including specifically: (a) Design of tonnage to be constructed. . (b) Most suitable shipyards.(c) Any steps necessary to insure full activity of shipyards.
4. If. in consequence of the principles stated above, ships are built in the United Kingdom, constructed in whole or in part with materials or labour contributed by any other such Nation, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to discuss with that other Nation an adjustment under which that other Nation will become the owner, on terms to be agreed, of some of the ships so constructed.!Full report of the proceedings of the Conference will shortly be sent to the War Cabinet.MINOR OPERATIONS.rTwo minelaying operations have been carried out in the North Sea. In each case -.a force of light cruisers and destroyers accompanied the minelayers, and carried out a sweep on the following day. During one of these an aeroplane flown from H.M.S. &quot; Yarmouth &quot; attacked and destroyed a Zeppelin off the coast of Jutland.A night attack on Zeebrugge has been carried out by coastal motor boats, which fired their torpedoes inside the mole, all being observed to explode. A small minefield has been laid by a destroyer near Zeebrugge.The monitor &quot; Terror &quot; fired a few rounds into Ostend naval station. 1  Submarine &quot; E. 34 &quot; has torpedoed and sunk the German Steamship &quot; Renate Xeonhardt &quot; off Texel Island.The monitors &quot; Earl of Peterborough &quot; and &quot; Sir Thomas Picton,&quot; working, in co-operation with the Italian Army, have bombarded the Austrian positions on the Hermada and the lines of communications near Trieste. *R.N.A.S. patrols from Dunkirk have brought down 2 enemy aircraft and driven down 5 out of control.   One of our machines is missing.R.N.A.S. machines from Home Stations brought down 3 machines of an enemy force which raided the South-East Coast. A patrol of 10 machines from Dunkirk engaged 25 enemy scouts covering the bombing force and drove dowm out of control at least 5. All our machines returned.Bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on enemy aerodromes at Snelleghem, Ghistelles and Houttave, railway centres at Ghent and Thourout, dumps at Thourout, Middelkerke and Raversyde, Bruges docks, Zeebrugge mole and shipping, batteries near Zeebrugge, and Brugeoise works. The total weight of bombs dropped was about 20 tons.In the Eastern Mediterranean four seaplanes from the &quot;Empress&quot; bombed torpedo ; sheds and storehouses on piers at Beyrout, causing fires in the sheds.Movements op German Merchant Ships.German Steamship &quot;Renate Leonhardt &quot; left Holland and was sunk by &quot;E. 34&quot; on 23rd August, 1917.To and from Norwegian Ports : Arrived, 8 ; Left, 12.

There is at present no sign of a German combined land and sea attack on Riga, and up to the 22nd -August Russian scouting seaplanes reported no naval concentration, though German trawlers were reported on that date to be sweeping towards the western entrance to the Gulf of Riga.The British submarine base has been transferred to Hango, on the south-west coast oi Finland.
