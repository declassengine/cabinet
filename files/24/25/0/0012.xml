$HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANJNIC MAJESTY1 S SOVSRITOflT.S J 0 R E T. G.T.-1912WAR    CAB 1KB T,AIRSHIP CONSTRUCTION POLICY. Appreciation for War Cabinet.The Board of Admiralty desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the urgent necessity for an Increase in the programme of rigid and non-rigid air-ships.   By reason of its endurance in the air and ability to hover, a lighter-than-air ship is more effective than any other craft, either surface or air, for naval reoon-naissance, oceanic reconnaissance, the escort of convoys &amp;c, for which purposes they are essential.     In fine Weather a long-range airship can effectively search an area of over 100,000 square miles in from 40 to 50 hours.The value of this form of scouting has been proved during the war, both by our own and the enemy Fleets, and the War Staff are strongly of the opinion that the necessity for an increase in the Airship programme is completely demonstrated.The Board recommend that a Fleet of 16 rigid air-ships and 70 non-rigid airships of various types should be kept in commission for war service, and it is estimated that this programme will invtive the following expenditure. It should be noted, however, that the cost of construction and the life of a rigid airship of full size are at the * present time both matters of conjecture.RIGID  AIRSHIPS.It is proposed that the number of &quot;L.33&apos;1 Class on order should be increased from 5 to 16, and that building work should be stopped on Uo. 28 of the 23 ,TX&quot; Class, erection of which has not yet been commenced: -Cost of construction of 11 Airships at   200,000 each 2,200.000Additional building and housing berths 1,600,000Approximate additional capital 3,800,000expenditureEstimated expenditure for the maintenance of a fleet of 16 rigid airships in commission on the assumption of two years1 life . 1,600.000per annum.
gOg RIGID AIRSHIPS^It is proposed that the number of non-rigid airships which should he kept in commission for war service should he 70, which is approximately the number existing to-day.   Additional housing acoom-modation,&apos; estimated at  141,000, will be required, and the estimated expenditure for the maintenance of a Fleet of that number is  250,000 per annum.The work will be commenced immediately the programme is approved;   but it is estimated that the capital expenditure will not be completed before the end of 1919.It is proposed to establish a separate Airship Department under the Deputy Controller for Armament Production, and to transfer to that Department the design, production, and repair of the airships, in order that joint and overlapping responsibility may be eliminated..The approval of the foregoing programme by the War Cabinet is sought.30th August, 1917.,
