SECRET.Copy NO.iiWAR OFFICE,2124-9-17.931am cabinet.etary,I attach a Note which General Foch handed toi^^Cnis morning on the question of sending 100 heavy guns from the 1st French Army to reinforce General Cadorna,I had a Conference this morning with General Foch and Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and General Foch then elaborated the views contained in his Note,He showed me a telegram he had received from General Cadorna in which General Cadorna said that he proposed to take certain hills immediately on his front by the 15th September and carry out a further operation designed tb capture the Hermada Ridge in the first fortnight of October. He made no mention of tho capture of Trieste nor of any specific number of guns, but said he would be glad of any guns that could be sent;   he added that for climatic reasons, he attached importance to the termination of the operations by October 15th.General Foch said that he advocated sending 100 guns because it was important to follow up the Italian success in every way possible,It was General Foch&apos;s opinion that the withdrawal of these guns from the First French Army would not imperil the success of the operations in the north.   He considered the continuance of these operations to be indespensable. attached great importance to their success, and believed they would be successful.But according to Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s plan, it was not proposed to make any material use of General Antoine&apos;s Army for at least a month after the next battle in Flanders had begun,   During that month General Antoine&apos;s heavy guns would be doing little or nothing,General
General Foch at first said that he thought there would ho time to send the guns to General Cadorna and get them back for General Antoine&apos;s operations, but subsequently on Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s representations he agreed that this would be impossible.   He maintained, however, that he advocated no change of plan, but merely a transfer of guns from a place where they would not be required to one where they would be of the greatest use.    He said that he had had no communication on the subject with General Antoine.Sir Douglas Haig, on the other hand, insisted that the removal of these guns would seriously affect his plans, and that he required them now and throughout the whole of his operations.   He stated that he had seen General Antoine yesterday and he was in complete agreement with him on this matter.    I pointed out to General Foch that at the time of General Nivelle&apos;s operations the British Government had instructed Sir Douglas Haig and I to give General Nivelle every possible support and defer to his wishes and views in every way.   This we had loyally done.   Later the British and French Governments had agreed to the operations now being carried out in Flanders under Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s orders and I represented that as regards these operations Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s views should carry the same weight as General Nivelle had in the Spring operations.The result of the Conference was to show a complete divergence of opinion between General Foch and Sir Douglas Haig, the former insisting that his proposal entailed no change of plan;   Sir Douglas Haig being equally insistent that it would affect his operations detrimentally.(Sd.)

11214Etat-Major General del Armee Paris, 2nd September 1917.Groupe Avant3 e Bureau. -...____ N PTE,In reply to the propositions which were made to him by the Minister for War, General Cadorna has stated that he sets great store on the sending over to Italy of a reinforcement of French batteries of medium calibre, -- and that,  if such help cannot be given him for tho first stage of his operations (attack of Monte San Gabriele, Monte San Marco, to be carried out in a few&apos;days) he would willingly accept it for the second stage,  (attack of Monte Hermada,  which will take place some ten or fifteen days after the first).On September the 1st.,  the Chief of the French General Staff has examined with the Commander-in-Chief *f the Northern and North-Eastern Armies upon what con-ditions France might grant Italy the contemplated help. They agreed on the following points.The reinforcement of the Italian attack by sending fresh French batteries is justified by the value of the results already obtained on the Bains isza Table - Land and by the importance of those which are aimed at viz., the conquest of the Hermada.The operations at present being carried, out or in course of preparation on the French front (right bank of the Mouse; counter-preparation of an enemy gas attack in Champagne; preparation of an attack render-ed necessary in view of the consolidation wf our position on the Ladies&apos; Pfad) take up all our disponibilities in ,      Heavy Artillery (Northern and North Eastern Armies).But a large proportion of Heavy Artillery (more than 350 guns) is at present unemployed in the first Army.
Considering tho present state of the Franco-British offensive in Flanders, the British G.O.C. con-templates two attacks on a large scale to he carried out &quot;by the British Forces alone, before they have gained sufficient ground for tho first French Army to he enabled to resume its offensive:   and it is no exaggeration to reckon at a month the tine necessary for him to achieve his ends*On the other hand, tho agreements passed between the General Commanding the Northern and North-East era&quot; Armies and the Field Marshal in command of the British Expeditionary Force stipulate that no French force ( infentry or artillery) is to be withdrawn from Flanders before the end of tho offensive.In aonsec[uence, as the British Higher Command has expressed its relentless intention to carry on  this offensiveit may be said that, during the last month of the fine season, a large proportion of the French Heavy Artillery will be uselessly immobilised in Flanders, whe the intervention of part or the whole of that artillery, could on the Isonzo, help to secure important results. From the above it is to be concluded;1- That considering the stage which&apos;the 1917 battle has reached it is most important for the Coalition to give forthwith to the Italian Army the most effective artillery help possible..2, That the only artillery forces at&quot; present available are those of the First French Army at present on the standstill.3. That, even if they were deprived of the support of that army, the British Armies are in a position to carry on in Flanders the battle now taking place a battle which, even as the new offensive at present being prepared by the French Army, is indispensable in order to fix down the enemy and prevent tho sending over of German reinforcements to Italy.
4.   That it is advisable to enter upon a new agreement enabling the French Higher Command to availthemselves of the greater part of the Heavy Artillery of the First Army with a view to sending it over to Italy, pending the complete withdrawal of that Army.The British General Staff by concurring with the above views would contribute for their share towards the mutual help to be afforded to Italy for the common cause.
