QolGiielvOu^(This Document is the Property of^3y further communication should be ressed not to any individual by name,The Director, ard of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1.I should quote the Reference Number and ie of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address:-&quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot; Telephone:-Victoria 8240.His Britannic .V!ajesty&apos;s Government.)h If&quot; S    &quot;Board op Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1.5th September, 1917.Q7A V;Sir.I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended the 4th September:-Telegraphic reports from the - Department1s Commissioners indicate that, while the recent gale has added seriously to the difficulties with which the farmer has been faced ever since the harvest started, the actual damage done has been less than was feared.The gale was most severely felt over a broad band of country stretching from North Wales to the coasts of Kent and Sussex.     Reports of great injury to crops come from Oxford, Buckingham, Kent and several other counties situated on this line.     Serious damage is also reported from North Devon, Somerset and Hampshire.     On the other hand, the eastern, north-midland, and northern counties were relatively much less affected.Damage was caused chiefly by the shaking out of over-ripe grain, of which there is much in the country.     It is not possible to estimate the losses from this cause;   but in a few instances It is stated that from six to eight bushels per acre may have disappeared.    Much injury has also been caused by the twisting of corn already laid so that in many cases harvesting by the self-binder will be impossible.     Fortunately the counties reporting sprouting corn are.not numerous, and the improvement in the weather which has taken place should prevent further injury from this cause.
In the eastern districts much of the wheat crop and part of the oats had been secured before the gale.Fruit growers have:suffered more loss, relatively, than farmers.   The fruit growing counties lay in the track of the gale, and some localities report the fall of more than half the apple and plum crops.Speaking generally the fuller information now received is of a more reassuring character, and there are good hopes of saving the bulk of the corn harvest.ORGANIZATION, Determination of Tenancies.During the past week 17 orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 925 acres and two orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 42 acres *   The total number of cases in which tenancies have been determined is now 205 comprising 17,167 acres.   In 167 of these cases the landlords were authorised to determine, and in the remaining 38 cases the tenancies were determined by the Board.   .Damage by Game.The Surrey Committee have dealt with two cases of damage by pheasants and one case of damage by rabbits.   The Cornwall Committee are making special inquiries as to Colonel Prideaux Brune&apos;s Game Preserves at Padstow, as to which complaints have been received.Drainage of Lands,It will be convenient in this Report to give a summary of the action taken by Executive Committees during the past five months under the Drainage of Lands Orders.The first Drainage of Lands Order, enabling Agricultural Executive Committees to call upon occupiers of adjoining lands to
put channels in order, or, in default, to do the work and recover the cost, was made on the 31st March last. &apos;: This Order also empowers the regulation of mills and sluices.   The second Order enabling Committees to exercise the powers of Drainage Boards and Commissions of Sewers in certain cases was made on May 7th, 1917. Armed with these powers the Committees have been enabled already to get work, done in a number of cases, largely by consent of those interested: and without the issue of compulsory notices.   In many more cases schemes for improvements have been prepared and are in more or less advanced stages of progress.&quot;The following summary is brought up to 31st August:-Norfolk.   Action under these Orders was first undertaken by this Executive Committee\ which arranged for the cleaning out of the upper reaches of the River Bure.   A meeting of the adjoining owners was convened and the work has been carried out by them under the Committee&apos;s auspices without the issue of compulsory orders.   The twelve miles from Coltishall Lock upwards (the lowest lock) was very badly congested with all manner of obstructions;   and a substantial area of agricultural land will be benefitted... The River Tas and a portion of the River Yare above Norwich are being dealt with in a similar way by a Committee acting on behalf of the Agricultural Executive&quot; Committee and comprised of representatives of all parties interested, including the Great Eastern Railway Company.   The Executive Committee are carrying out the clearance of the River Waveney from Beccles.to the head waters, in concert with the East Suff oik Coirjnit-tee.   The work on the Tas. and Yare and the Waveney is being carried out by prisoners of war paid by the State, the schemes being of such an extensive nature that the benefit will be widespread and not confined to a small group of.: persons.      --The Committee have had an exhaustive scheme prepared for the improvement of the drainage of a considerable area of
land on the Eastern shores of the Wash near Burnham and Heacham. Prisoners of war have been applied for to carry out the work, and it is hoped that they will arrive on 8th or 9th September, Cheshire *   The Rivers Birkett and Fender (in the vJirral Peninsula) are being cleansed by prisoners of war paid by the State for the reason given above, and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board are co-operating by cleaning out the portion which is owned by them in the County Borough of Birkenhead and runs in culvert.Operations are also being undertaken in connection with the River Gowy (which presents difficult problems owing to various mechanical obstructions such as mills and sluices), the River Weaver and the Tuce, Kelsby and Frodsham Marshes abutting on the Manchester Ship Canal.     The powers of the Drainage Boards concerned will be enforced by the Committee if necessary, and the co-operation of the Ship Canal Company has been invited in the last named case.Yorkshire.     The West Riding Committee have been active in this matter and have effected substantial improvements in that part of the Fens which lies near Doncaster, and is drained by the Don, Thome and Idle.     Channels have been, and are being, cleaned out near Keadby and Tickhill, on Hatfield Chase, West Moors Park, Gowdall Moss and Norton Common; also at Woodhouse and Nun Monkton.The East Riding Committee have cleaned out the Greenoak^ Goit and the Bellasize Drain; and have by the co-operation of the Drainage Trustees secured the cleansing of the River Foulness; all these subsidiary channels drain the low lying lands on the north of the number.In the North Riding, the Committee are, with the help of the North Eastern Railway Company, forming a scheme for the cleansing of the Rivers Derwent and Rye, the long-standing
difficulties of which are well known.     This Committee is carrying out work on the Rivers Poss and Kyle and other eastern tributaries of the Ouse.Not tinghamshire.   The work of cleaning out the drainage channels on Everton and Gringley cars is being commenced,this week, by the employment of prisoners of war.     This is being undertaken by the Executive Committee in concert with the Drainage Board, and it is hoped that the cultivation of 4,000 acres will be greatly improved.     It has been arranged to defer the repayment of the amounts advanced by the Department for carrying out this work until the harvest of 1918 has been realised. Essex.     The cleaning out of the River Mardyke which drains a considerable area of valuable land near Orsett and Purfleet Is being carried out, with the labour of prisoners of war, jointly by the Executive Committee under the powers of the first Drainage of Lands Order, and the Rainham Commissioners of Levels under the powers of their Commission.West Sussex. The Committee have secured the cleansing, by the Drainage Board concerned, of the Rife, which drains a valuable area of corn land near Littlehampton.Anglesey.   The Committee are undertaking, with the help of prisoners of war, the improvement of the upper channels of Malltraeth Marsh, the lower portions being kept efficient by the Drainage Board. Flintshire and Denbighshire.   The Executive Committees of these counties are co-operating for the improvement of the channels of Rhuddlan Marsh near Rhyl, for which an application has been made for the services of prisoners of war.     The Flintshire Committee are also seeking the co-operation of the persons interested in the drainage of land adjoining Prestatyn.
Merionethshire * In this county a scheme of improvement in a small area on the Afon Treweryn at Arenig is being carried out by prisoners of war;   an advance has been made to meet themade by the Drainage Inspector of the Department who has been engaged almost continuously since the beginning of May to the present time on inspections undertaken at the invitation of the Executive Committees.   The following is a list of the drainage areas and rivers on which he has reported, apart from those already mentioned.   In the majority of these cases, the Committees are taking preliminary action, by the convening of meetings, to g work done by consent, the preparation of plans, or the issuing of compulsory notices.   Wherever railway companies are concerned (as they frequently are, either as possessing bridges over the river or as owners of the navigation) they have readily given Or promised assistance.Bedfordshire.

River Dovey.The powers of the first Drainage of Lands Order have been applied to secure the cleansing of many m-Snor watercourses draining single farms or small areas;   action of this kind has been reported from Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Cheshire, Durham, Flintshire, Kesteven, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and West Suffolk.The power to regulate the flow of water through mills and sluices has been chiefly utilised in the Eastern Counties. The Norfolk and Suffolk East and West Committees have issued orders of this kind with regard to mills and sluices on the Rivers Lark, Little Ouse, Thet, Waveney, Yare and Tas, and in Sculthorpe Fen; and the Bedfordshire Committee as to the mills generally in the county.     The West Suffolk Committee have directed the South Level Commissioners to keep open the Cross Waters Staunch on the Little Ouse, and it is hoped that this measure will afford considerable relief in the Brandon district.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No,2).Reports from 1,058 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that under the Cultivation of Lands Order 192,952 applications for plots have been made, and 174,533 plots, containing a total area of 12,936 acres, have been provided.
......    The amount of spade work put into &quot;War Allotments&quot; is ,   .: .1most striking.     Situated chiefly in the larger centres of . * population, these plots have been taken up with the greatest enthusiasm, and are an undoubted success.     While the greater part . has been given up to potatoes, good results have been obtained with other crops, and on every hand the work and the many resulting benefits are spoken of in an enthusiastic way, and hopes are expressed that the plots may be retained for cultivation in the   : .. years to come.HORTICULTURAL SECTION.The total number of Horticultural Representatives now v&apos; appointed by the Department Is 675.The number of glass jars despatched during the week was 173,420, making a total of 1,561,380, and leaving a balance of only 35,014 to be despatched.Potato Spraying.   In view of the experience gained during the potato spraying this year, negotiations are being carried out with manufacturers of Knapsack Spraying machines with a view to perfecting the types to be put on the market next year.A report on potato spraying by the Agricultural Organiser for Cornwall states that spraying has proved effective in checking disease, and many have undertaken spraying who, twelve months ago,   6 ridiculed it.     1,500 acres in the county have been sprayed this year, and It is estimated that 8,000 acres will be sprayed next year.A report on the spread of potato blight on sprayed potatoes in the neighbourhood of St. Alban!s has been Investigated by an Inspector of this Department, who confirms the statement and attributes the cause of spread to the fact that non-approved spraying materials were used.
Preserving of Fruit and Vegetables. &apos; 152 demonstrations in Fruit and Vegetable Bottling have been given during the week, making a . total of 1,857... Twenty one home canners have been sold during .:. the week, making a total of 107.   The cans disposed of are 76^&apos;. gross of 3 lb., and 56 gross of 2 lb. cans, making a total of 58,212.   Twelve demonstrations in canning have been held during the week in various parts of the country in addition to;numerous . demonstrations given at the offices of this Department.Experiments in the use of a Rotary Drying Machine instituted with a view to using existing malt driers are being carried out at Gloucester.In addition to the stations referred.to in last week&apos;s Report, a Pulping Station has been installed at Cambridge capable of dealing with 20 tons per day.Potato Flour. Independent estimates have been made by representa-tives of the Ministry of Food and by members of this Department, which, although differing considerably, agree in indicating that the cost of production of potato flour is exceedingly high.   It was accordingly decided at a joint meeting of representatives of the Ministry of Food and this Department to give preference to other methods of disposing of any possible surplus of potatoes. Of alternative methods the following are being tested:-1.     The use of whole potatoes in bread-making. Tests carried out shew that excellent bread may be made by using a certain proportion of potatoes with G.R. flour, and it Is proposed to take the necessary steps to urge upon persons who make bread for their own consumption as well as small bakers to use potatoes for this purpose.   A leaflet on the use of potatoes in bread-making is in course of preparation.2.     Potato Starch. A trial is being made of a process which has not before been tried in this country, for which it is claimed that potato starch may be produced at small cost. .    .
Alcohol. . The Ministry of Munitions is ^making enquiries vlr&amp;b t&amp;e/ possibility of using potatoes slightly diseased for the - -manufacture of spirit for industrial purposes. ..The difficulty, .... appears &quot;to. be mainly one of collection and transport. ,... Distribution of Sugar. Two thousand tons of sugar having been put at the disposal of this Department by the Sugar Commission for distribution to fruit growers) 1.895 tons have been allocated) and orders from 35 counties for a total of 1,333 tons have been received and transferred to.the wholesale agents undertaking the despatch of consignments.   The principle-adopted in making allocations has been to assign the largest quantities to counties growing the largest amount of fruit.   These quantities range from 90 tons in the case of Kent to 25 or fewer tons in the case of other counties.The original idea of the Sugar Commission in allocating th^ 2,000 tons was that it should go mainly, if not exclusively,to chief fruit   growing counties, but careful consideration on the part of officers of this Department led to the adoption of a more general distribution, the chief reason being that a large grower of fruit has not generally any suitable facilities for making large quantities of jam.   Considerable discontent has been manifested owing to the fact that sugar is available for growers of fruit only, and it has been pointed out to the Department that this presses hardly on villagers, cottagers and others accustomed to making blackberry jam.   In view, however, of the shortness of time in which the sugar had to be distributed it did not seem advisable to attempt to negotiate any modification of the conditions for distribution laid down by the Sugar Commission. Effect of Fixed Meat Prices on the Food Production Programme. A   . memorandum on the cost of producing beef, and the effect of the meat prices recently fixed by the Food Controller on the Departments Programme of 1918 has been prepared.   It is shown
that.with restricted supplies of feeding stuffsi and no relation    \ between the price of meat and the cost of production, the position -y t    of the farmer of arable land who depends on winter feeding to help &apos; him with his cnrp crops is a. difficult one,   He cannot hope to escape loss if he sells in spring;   but if he can carry his stock through the winter as thriving stores, and finish them on grass,. he may recoup his outlay.   Grass for finishing cattle and sheep, will therefore be at a premium on arable farms in 1918, and as soon as .... farmers realise the position there will be groat reluctance to plough out temporary leys.Cultivation of Rye as a Grain Crop. A leaflet on this subject has been prepared, and will shortly be issued.Breaking up Grass Land in 1916-17. The report on this subject has been published as a 37 page pamphlet, and nearly 20,000 copies have already been distributed.Plant Diseases. Reports have been made on 51 specimens of diseased crops during the week.   The Honorary Correspondent in charge of the investigation into wheat bulb fly reports that many fields moderately attacked have made a good recovery.    The study of the life history of the pest in question is being continued.   Local reports on the position as regards plant diseases have been received from eight correspondents. An Honorary Correspondent from Kent reports that potato disease has destroyed the haulms of the plant or field crops throughout that county, except where two good sprayings have been given. Other reports appear to indicate that, with few exceptions, the haulms have been destroyed by disease throughout the eastern counties as far north as Lincolnshire, and little further . increase in crop can be expected.LABOUR.Soldier Labour.:      Reports received from the Departmentfs Commissioners shew that during the past week some 651 skilled and 126 unskilled men were sent to the Distribution Centres.
The numbers sent to farmers during the week are.1,121 skilled and 839 unskilled/    The numbers remaining at the Depots total    -2,167 skilled, 3,603 unskilled.     There is still t shortage of skilled ploughmen at many of the Diatribution Centres.In connection with the Training scheme, land has been inspected in Essex with the object of setting up a centre at which -men can be instructed in both motor tractor work and horse ploughing.     The men while there will be in the charge of two N.C.0.S, both skilled ploughmen, and a tractor expert,     A similar centre will shortly be established in each of the other Commands.During the last few days some 80 men have been sent out from Distribution Centres to train as tractor drivers under experienced men who are already working.with tractors in various parts of the country.Horses.   With reference to the scheme for the supply of teams ofhorses with skilled ploughmen to assist farmers in the work of   -increased cultivation for the 1918 harvest, orders for the issueof 155 additional horses have been sent to Remount Depots, makinga total of 1,005 horses up to date.     Some 400 teams are now atwork, each in charge of a skilled ploughman.  .. Of theseploughmen, 120 are Metropolitan Policemen, and the rest soldierploughmen attached to the Agricultural Companies.&apos; Women1 s Branch.-The National Service returns this week show that 6,672women have been accepted and 11,494 rejected.     Of the numberaccepted 6,669 are accounted for as follows:-In Instruction Centres, &apos;. 1,086On Farm Work, 4,989- Waiting for references to ... -      be placed in traning centres      128 Waiting for employment Indepots ...208 &apos; &apos;.-&apos;r -Waiting in their own homes.        258The figures given above of the number of women unemployed In depots are somewhat misleading.     Since the date to which the
returns refer, the majority of those in depots have been sent out to work in the harvests or in fruit picking, while others have been sent for further specialised training.    As reported last week a certain numbe?.* of National Service Volunteers have been lent to the Forage Department for hay-baling and similar work.     It has : been arranged that those employed temporarily in other branches of work shall not be recalled for farm work if there are women in any part of the country unemployed and in depots.     These women have been lent only to other Departments and will remain members of the Land Army.     In this way a reserve of available labour will be   ,;;; built up for agricultural work in the spring.Some interesting figures are to hand of the percentage of failures among the National Service Volunteers who have been trained by the Women&apos;s Branch.     To the end of July the total of failures amount only to 14$ for the whole country.The training and placing of National Service Volunteers in new employment during the winter is meeting with success.   In Nottinghamshire, the Agricultural Executive Committee are working in close co-operation with the Women&apos;s Committee and the result is that the greater number of the owners of threshing tackle in the county have agreed to employ women as supplementary to skilled men on this work.     Instruction in motor tractor ploughing and rabbit trapping is also continuing, but women are holding back from taking up the latter work.     All the National Service Volunteers in a training&apos;centre in Kentu are being taught ditching, and it Is felt that women skilled in this work will be easy to place in employment..   MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS. /- :,&apos;-i:^VMotor Tractors.   Fifty^eJLght further tractors have been consigned ;to&apos;Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales during the week bringing the total number allocated to Committees up to :. 1,060.     In addition, 256 tractors are on offer to Executive Committees,&apos; and 10 to Ireland in addition to the 60 offered to
Scotland: referred to In last week&apos;s Report.Harness.The position as regards.the supply of harness is improving.: ; A harness repair shop, principally for collars to be       ; obtained under the Order -Issued by the Army Council,is being set : up at the Departments Base Supply Depot, Willesden; and arrange-   ;; ments are being made ior obtaining the necessary skilled labour, tools,&apos; etc.\ .&apos;- - - &quot;SUPPLIES.. --: - V-Sulphate of Ammonia. Almost the whole of the output of Sulphate of Ammonia for September has already been soldj and there is now some difficulty in supplying the requirements of the Ministry of Munitions without trenching on the demand for agricultural purposes. Superphosphate * A circular setting out the prices at which Superphosphate can be obtained is no?/ being issued and farmers are being advised to place their orders with their usual merchants and to take delivery at the earliest possible date. Compound Manures. Several meetings have been held during the week to discuss the terms of the Draft Order fixing the prices of Compound Manures. The Order is Intended to prescribe the prices at which Compound Fertilisers may reasonably.be sold, but every endeavour is being made to avoid inflicting any undue hardship on the trade. Careful consideration is being given to the.makers of Horticultural Fertilisers who occupy a rather special position. Basic Slag. In order to meet the wishes of the Irish Department of Agriculture, English makers have.been asked to refrain from accepting up to 21st September further orders from England and Scotland in order to give Irish buyers an opportunity of ordering any further supplies they may require. Practically the whole output up to May-next has already been sold and the balance remaining for disposal   &apos;-is very small.&apos;,:Arrangements have been made by the Ministry of Munitions for grinding a sample lot of 100 tons taken from a large&apos; slag: heap at Middlesborough in order to test the quality of the slag-        .
on a large scale. If the results prove satisfactory a dump of 150,000 tons is available in addition to a monthly output of4; 000 tons.-:.;Binder Twine. Arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Munitions for 14,500 tons of binder twine to be reserved for use In England and Wales for the harvest of 1918* and a guarantee has been given by this Department that any unsold balance will be taken over from the makers at an agreed price.Blast Furnace Dust. A scheme for dealing with Blast Furnace dust &apos;-.:&apos;: has, been put before the Phosphates and Potash Distribution Committee, and the Department is In correspondence with the Potash Production Department with a view to putting this scheme into operation, but it is feared that action will not be secured as rapidly as this Department desires.Lime. Efforts-are being made to press forward the various proposals for the utilisation of the waste lime produced at Munition factories, Soap Works, etc., and to arrange for the grinding of limestone rock, but Selay is occasioned by the difficulty of getting even simple kinds of plant necessary for securing the desired output.Seed Wheat.   Owing to the unfavourable weather of the past few weeks, the Purchasing Committees were authorised on August 27th to buy any available lots of 1916 -The at suitable for seed purposes. The additional quantity obtained will be small, and if weather conditions are favourable further purchasing will cease.The quantity of 1916 seed wheat sold is just over 1,100 quarters. Orders are now reaching the Department for seed wheat of the 1917 crop.Seed Potatoes. Arrangements are being made to purchase up to 7,000. tons of seed potatoes of varieties immune to Wart Disease in England.   A Committee has been appointed to inspect the crops and&apos; make provisional purchases as soon as the Seed Potatoes.(Immune   ...
Varieties) Order is issued.The question of price presents some difficulty; it is ;&apos;// hoped that for English grown seed the price will not exceed  8. The Department hope to obtain supplies both from Scotland and &apos;/&apos;/./&apos;-Ireland/ amounting to at least 3,000 tons, but no accurate      / information a3 to quantities is available at present. /Orders have been placed for 200,000 bags for the despatch of the &apos;seed1.It is proposed that tho potatoes purchased by the Department should be sold in quantities of not less than 4 tons of any one variety and only to approved potato dealers to be selected by the Department, Co-operative Agents and Farmers. &apos;: -I am,Sir, &apos;-:/&apos;&apos;Your obedient Servant,Director-General.P&apos;he Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Probh e r o, M. ?.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisneries.
