flj g E a t.0,1/1^./342.&quot;*c^B/?^x   (This -Document is the-Property of\/s,His Britannic A/lajesty&apos;s Government)Copy Ho3819 * 17 *^fe.RAIi STAFF NOTE ON MEMORANDUM BY SERVIAN PRIMS MINISTER, 14th AUGUST 1917.1.1/118/340-of J t168/727,3.With reference to paragraph 1 of the Memorandum, the Foreign Office have telegraphed to the French Government asking for a more equitable adjustment of the front.   No reply has yet been received. .As regards paragraph 8.of the Memorandum, the position as to the transport of Serbian troops from Archangel to Salonika is as follows:-The total number of Serbian troops is believed to be about 16,000.     The Russians have made definite arrange-ments that 3,148 of the above (being all that remains of the 2nd. Serbian Division) should be ready at Archangel for embarkation on the 5th September and tho Admiralty have made arrangements for the transport of this number, to sail about 9th September for a British port. Arrangements arc in train for forwarding these troops via Cherbourg and Taranto to Salonika. -  There remain in Roumania roughly 12,900 Serbians.These aro called tho 1st Division..    This division has. been made up to strength by drawing upon the 2nd Division. The Russians have shilly-shallied about letting these latter go since the 5th July, when the question was first raised.     On the urgent representations of the Russian.. Commander on the Roumanian, front Russian General Headquar-tcrs decided that the 1st Serbian Division should bo retainedinITH IBMiminWHllllMllllll
in&apos;reserve., and could not be released till about the middle.of November.   We. have again telegraphed to General Barter urging release in time for shipments to begin about 1st October.As far as the Admiralty are concerned theirposition is as follows:-(1)    They have provided transports for 3,900 troops9th September.   They can definitely promise for2,800 about 29th September.(2)   They may with difficulty be able to arrange forthe transport of 13,300 in addition to the above(or 20,000 in all) between 29th September and thedate on which navigation closes which is expectedto be about the 15th November.The position is somewhat complicated by the fact thatthe French are anxious to get the following transportedfrom Russia :-(A)   Alsatians..............about 1,000(E)    Russians for Salonika 5,200(C)   Czechs (believed to be alabour contingent) 10,700The French authorities profess to be entirely willing -that the Serbians should&apos;be given preference to the above, but there is reason to believe that they have influenced the Russian decision to keep back the Serbians and hope to get the above sent instead.At the request of the Admiralty, the V7ar Office in 1 their communication with Russia have laid it down as a con-dition that no man not absolutely necessary and efficientfor
fir war should be-sent. from Russia,     The Admiralty&apos;in addition ask for an assurance that no man shall be sent who may possibly later be required to be sent back t* Russia.With reference to paragraph 3 of the Memorandum, I agree that Staff Officers from each of the Allied Contingents should be attached to the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief, whose functions should be to keep the Commander-in-Chief informed on all matters Y/hich affect their contingents, and, at the same time, keep their own Commanders informed of what is going on at Headquarters and of the views and intentions of the Commander-$n-Chief.   But I doubt if any really use-ful purpose would be served by this so long as General Sarrail remains in command, and I am strongly opposed to the kind of council proposed by M, Pashitch, as the respons--ibility fcr the conduct of operations must, if they are to be efficiently conducted, rest with the Commander-in-Chief,I have communicated with General Milne on the subject, and I attach his reply, in which I concur.(Sgd.)

.   ENCLOSURE TO 0,l/ll9/542. .. -SECRET. .Prom     General Minet. G.H*C,9$ Salonika..&apos;,.&quot; To Sir WoRobertnonj, War Office.Mi 134 7/9/17.   10,45 p.m.Secret and personal.Your first proposal.     I consider the appointment - of a mission to the Serbians would have a most beneficial result as they depend to a large extent on word of Great Britain; see my private letter of Aug 25th.     The officer appointed should be loyal to the policy of the British Government, straightforward and - be gifted with considerable tact,     I do not know Phillips personally; but from report.regarding his attitude at Athens I consider he would be most suitable.I have no one here more suitable.. He should not^in any way be under&apos;me n^r have anything to do with my,liaison officer with Serbians; but I should see his report in the same way as I saw Granville&apos;s and Elliot1s.    It is essential that Troubridge and his staff be removed before he arrives.Your second proposal.     I consider the proposal to attach a General officer from each allied army to Sarrail&apos;s staff as quite out of the question and I &quot;cannot see what useful.end such action would serve .     The only General officer who can represent each army is its commander and he can see Sarrail whenever he likes.     An AULIC council of Generals without responsibility is unthinkable.     The appointment of a senior staff officer appears ideal in theory; but in ray opinion would, having regard to the personality of Sarrail and his .Chief of Staff, be unwork-able in practice and a constant source of danger owing to frictiorYJere strong men appointed Sarrail would ignore them,    wore weak men appointed they might become inferior liaison officers with nothing better to do than pick up scraps of news besides being a source of dangerous misunderstanding,   Sarrail is of the type that keeps everything in his own hands and is not    &quot; given to accepting advice even from his own staff.
