ffltgjDOOjJjfflS, IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S aOVEKIIMSITT)ff 3 C RBI;.;;^T; 1090 WAR;   CABINET- .g ON PI T IQffg IN IRELAND.- . Memorandum by&apos; the Chief.Secrotary or Ire1and *Less violence than heretofore is still observable in the progress of the&apos;Sinn Fein movements/ Incitements to rebellion and to ,definite.organisation with a view to rebellion at any convenient early date are not now common in speeches.   Drilling is also somewhat less prevalent in Clare and kerry where it had become common..   The ohiefs of the Constabulary attribute this improvement to the sharp measures recently taken by way of arrest and trial by Count Martial or by resident magistrates of some principal offenders.   It is no doubt due in part to the discovery the Sinn Fein leaders have made that the rebellious;: spirit is not so rife in the country generally as they supposed, it must be when they Were released from penal servitude. Concurrently with the somewhat quieter tons In the country there are efforts among Nationalist&apos; politicians to curry favour with the Uxtremiets by set denunciation of the repressive measures which have been taken.   I hope the necessity for arrestB will be lesb than it has been and that the pretext for complaints of &quot;coercion&quot; and of &quot;Castle conspiracies&quot; will thus be re-moved. &apos;Sinn Fein Clubs continue&quot; to be formed both in Dublin and the provinces.    There are six with upwards of 2,500 members in the City,and more than 500 with 30,000 members in the provinces.   I am satisfied,however, that the aovenent has considerably, lese force in it than it had three months ago, and that.the expectations of its leaders have appreciably weakened.Apart from, the Griffith and de Valera movement there are disagreeable symptoms in the South and West which show
the necessity of constant vigilance.   On various occasions in the past month promises have &quot;been entered in the night by raiderswho have, not been, traced by the police and small numbers of firearms or stores, of explosives have been carried off.   In no. instance have the perpretatore of these offences been discovered by the Constabulary.....Apart from the revolutionary movement the state of the country is bettered by.the improved prospects of the harvest. . Anything like general disaster to the crops is no longer apprehended.     The appointment of a strong Food Control Committee has been welcomed, and I hope the Food Controller . may be. able to take useful-local action-on their advice.(Initialled) H.E.D. , /8th.August, 1917.
