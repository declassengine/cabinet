(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty-s Government.)S E C RE T.Operations.P:&apos;rom :- General Barter,Russia,ToC.I.G.S.sar Office.4-9.-17.4-40.p..m.1227.At Riga, Germans continue advance.   They haveadvanced from little river Egel to Great Egel River, and have occupied Rotkaln.   Apparently 5l Siberian Divisions at this point made practically no resistance against very inferior German forces.    On coast north of Riga, German ships have bombarded several towns, as far as Kop-Susikas..These Divisions said to include 1st Guards Corps. Regarding Russian losses, have not yet been able to get official details..   Great indifference displayed generally regarding loss of Riga, partly because it was expected.   Another reason for this indifference is that whilst Bolshevist party believe it will help to secure early peace, military -party think that it will increase chance of early military supremacy in conduct of Russian affairs.It is rumoured in General Staff that Germansare embarking 5 Divisions, but this Is not definite.
