Prom  Assistant Military Attache&apos;, Petrograd. To       DeMoIo6th September, 1917.M.1330.Savinkov has gone to Stavka where I am informed a conference is to be held, definitely to frame the measures with which General Korniloff wishes to. restore discipline. . In addition to his other duties Savinkof has been appointed Acting Minister of. Marine.   Kerenski in an Army order issued to-day praises the part played by officers during and since the Revolution.   This tardy recognition is evidently meant to assist to restore officers1 strength.   In the order Kerenski Btates that the distrust between officers and men was brought about by the old regime.   This (l group ? obvious\ ly shows.how impossible it is to trust.,in  , Kerenski or expect any good to come while,he is ln;:power. Representatives of.the Workmen here discussed the present situation in view of the Riga disaster.   They demand in their resolution the removal of all reactionary Generals from Petrograd including Present C.in C. of.garrison and Chief of General Staff here and that control of Petrograd Garrison.should be handed Over to the Council. Results of. Municipal elections show that the social revolutionaries have, attained most votes, then the Bolsheviks and the cadets only take 3rd place.   There are no signs of unity to meet-the present crisis, in fact everything points to the reverse with the influx of fugitives from Riga district which may be expected any time now. and the certainty of an influx of German&quot; agents from the same direotion couple(d) with present absence of discipline of police authority and provisions it iB easily seen that trouble.may break out in Petrograd at any time which must have the very.worst effect on operations at the front.   Grand &quot;Dukes Michael and Paul haye^ been* . -     . &quot;* -* &quot;arrested by Kerenski.
