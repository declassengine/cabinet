To t-      C.T.G.S., War Office.Sept. 5th 1917.B.A.715.   Noon 5th.   I have come back from a short tour on /      the southern &quot;iront.   The present disposition of the troops is . very bad, but to-day I have had a long conversation with General Berthelot who assures me that&quot;steps are already being taken to re-arrange troops in a reasonable manner.   The 8th Russian Corps still holds a small section between 1st and 2nd Roumanian armies: the liaison between Russians and Roumanians is bad and (one group undecipherable) two dangerous points of junction are offered to the enemy.   The 8th Corps is to be relieved by Roumanians who will then hold the line continuously from Ocna to the Sereth..Headquarters of 1st Army at present is at Tecuci, and is hopelessly out of touch with its troops on the west bank, the roads over the river being practically impassable for motors.   This headquarters is to move shortly to Adjodd, where it will be more central.     Russians of 6th Army will take the line almost to the Sereth, but the Roumanians will still have to have about a brigade on the east bank.I found all army commanders quite calm and confident that for the time being the enemy has exhausted his strength. General Grigeresco, commanding 1st Army, (? group omitted) very indifferent soldier, full of talk but very ignorant about his own troops.   General Regeuza, commanding 4th Russian army, is (group omitted) without being clever.   With General Averesco I had much conversation and he Impresses me as being by far the best soldier: he visits his troops and knows his ground.   He is unfortunately having a row with&apos;the French Mission, but I have seen General Berthelot on the question and he has promised to remove the chief cause of offence-I find with regret that the morale of the Russians is still hopelessly.bad and they are very unreliable.   The result of the Moscow conference has been disappointing to the officers. Some steps have been taken in the direction of re-establishing .&apos; discipline and a few good officers are making the most of those.   But bad and indifferent officers view these disciplinary methods with-alarm because they tend to inflame the troops: many regimental officers are afraid to go into battle for, fear of being shot by their own men.   Artillery and cavalry are fairly good, but infantry still suffer from desertion and insubordination, and the fresh reinforcements are untrained.   The Russian army, in fact, will not pull its weight for a long time, and the best that can be hoped is that it will offer some help to the defensive.   Now that arrangements are well in hand for removal and destruction of railway stock etc., I propose to spend more time on the .-   front.   Captain Barrett who is thoroughly in touch with Roumanian headquarters in Jassy can carry on routine work. I again beg that he may be granted rank of Major in order to give him more weight in dealing with foreign officers.
