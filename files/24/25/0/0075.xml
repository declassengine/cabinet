Tho &apos;    suggestion apparently is that the Tribunals ought to have given -i absolute exemption to conscientious objectors much more freely than has been the case.   I em not oonoerned to defend all Tribu* nale.   Some may have been harsh or unwise, but I would point out that there is always an appeal from the deolsions of the Local Tribunal to an Appeal Tribunal,   X may also observe that although more than 200 oases cf eoneoientioue objectors have come before the Central tribunal, that body, admitted on all hands to be a fair and impartial body, has not given absolute exemption in a single instance. The attitude of the Tribunals is well indicated by a letter from Sir Lewis Dibdin in the &quot;Times&quot; of 4th September.ttien General ChiIds refers to the &quot;hundreds of men forced into the Any through the ineptitude of the Tribunale ftw should hams been clearly given exemption by the Tribunals&quot; he should remember that in not a few cases the military represents-tivee appealed against exemptions given by Local Tribunals,It *s as well to recall what is the statutory position Of the oonaoicntleue objector.The Uilitary Servloe Acts put upon all men of military -age with certain exceptions the liability to military service, subject to a right to apply for exemption on specified grounds. One of those grounds was &quot;a conscientious objection to the under-taking of oombatant, service&quot;.   Koto that a general objection to military service is not a ground of exemption. Sxemptions may be absolute, conditional er temporary as the exempting authority think best suited to the oass and the Acts specially provide that in the case of men claiming on the ground of conscientious objec-tion, the exemption may be from combatant servioe only or may be conditional on the applicant being engaged in work whioh in the opinion of the Tribunal ie work of national importance.The Intention of parliament seems clearly to be that although absolute exemption is not excluded in these oaees. they may normally be dealt with either by non-combatant eervice in the Army or by a requirement that in return for exemption from military servloe the objeotor shall undertake work of national importance,   A large number of objectors has been dealt with in this way. &apos;.&apos;The attitude of the Tribunals is not of much importance now as most of the eases of oonsolentious objectors which would come before Tribunale have been disposed of.   The real cuestlon raised by Lord Derby*s and Lord KlinerU memoranda is how to deal with what art there called &quot;absolutists&quot;.  The term la a new one oeined for the occasion and connotes not any particular form of oonselentious objectionror any sect religious or phllc* eophioal, but merely a type of objector s&amp;o claims that he la entitled under the Military Service Acts to absolute exemption and who declines to accept anything elsa.The &quot;absolutists&quot; are new in prison.  They consist of*(a) men tiho have been before Tribunale and have beenrefused exempt!on or allowed exemption from oombataut aervioe, or allowed exemption from all military ear-vice on oondition that they undertake work of national importance, -(b) men ifee have declined to make any application toTribunale and have been drafted into the Army.P.T.0,
On coming into the Ajnny they have resisted military control inf V after oourt martial have been sentenoed to imprisonment.   As a oonceaaien to oenaoientioua objectere,who found themselves in prison Mr. Asquith agreed in the sunnier of 1916 to an arran^e-ment under, whioh members of the Central; Tribunal would inter-view them individually and if theyconsidered that their oon-scientious scruples were sufficient to demand any respect, would recommend to the War Office that they should be offered employment under the Home t)ff ice Conjaittee...  In.this way a -considerable number have1 gained release from prison and have become employed in non-military work. The Absolutists are ft remnant of extreme men who,having first- resisted the ordinary operation of the law&apos;of the country, now^deoline to take -advantage of the expedient designed to mitigate in their interest the severity of that law.   Some decline to present their their case to the members of the Central Tribunal, others refuse to aocept work under the Home Office.:Committee.   They claim that they must be given: absolute exemption, and failing that they will accept no alternative-.&apos;. Their attitude is purely anarohical. Their grievance that having once declined to appear before the Central Tribunal, no locus poeftitentiae was available has, 1 under stand, been;&apos; removed.Whatever may be thought of the religious man whose oon-science leads him to prefer, any form of human punishment rather than that he should violate what he takes to be Divine instructions, it is impossible for a State-to recognise fcho right of any citizen to claim the privilege of citizenship and yet to defy the law..It is a notrioeabla fact that the United states and Hew Zealand, which /have attempted to^ m^e 5exceptions from military eess vice in favour of conscientious;^:obje.otors, ,!have confined:their exoeption to men who are;.memb,eravof.&quot;religious bodies professing tenets opposed to war,, and: have required that any such persons shall undertake any work which may be demanded of them. Neither country admits- absolutism i$,.any..form. .(Mrs..Hobhouse in her reoent book in favour of the conscientious objector, while quoting the American statute,omits the reference to the undertaking of civil worljWhile it is easy to be influenced in behalf of a few well-eduoated and earnest, though wrongheaded, individuals whom no one would wish to see languishing in prison, it is right to remember tha: these men are there of their own choosing, and that they could ex-change prison for useful national occupation without any violation c any conscientious, soruple which is entitled to respect, if they woul avail themselves of the means provided.   It must also be noted that the great mass of popular sentiment is wholly opposed to them.   Any further concession to men who will neither fight for their country nor work for it would be regarded as a bitter outrage both upon the living who are fighting, suffering and working for the noblest of causes andupon the^unnumbered.dead who have died for it. &apos;       .   -.&apos;-&quot;/.&apos;.- : - ..Sir Lewis Dibdin in his letter to the &quot;Times&quot; indicates some o^ the dangers to which sjy;: concession would open the door and General Chi Id1 s memorandum s^ows -that he is fully alive to them. There is also the difficulty of passing any measure through Parliament to which Lord Derby refers.; The reoent agitation against what was considered too lenient treatment of men under, the Home Office Committee is significant.Por myself I am; convinced that any concession of the kind suggested to the &quot;absolutist&quot; view would be disastrous.Tth September. 1917%   ; .-- ^     ;Bfote. . Lord ki^er-refers to the case of Mr. S arkes.   According to my information Mr. Sparkea made a very unfavourable impression upon the Appe*al Tribunal before whom, on the admi saion of Mr. T. S. Harvey, M.P., who was present, he had a fair hearing.
