For this period the total number of tons sunk on all routes is 68,915, as compared with 107,631 tons last week and 58,515 tons the previous week, the percentage of tonnage sunk on routes to and from United Kingdom ports being 1.21 as compared with 2.56 last week and 1.60 the average for the last five weeks. If steamships of over 1,600 tons only are considered the percentage of such tonnage sunk is 1.49 as compared with 3.46 last week.The following table shows by routes/ as regards steamships of over 500 tons gross register, the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine and mine to tonnage sailing to ancb from United Kingdom ports in recent weeks : 		Average per week		Route.		for 5 weeks ended	Week ended	Week endedUnited Kingdom, to and from 		1st September.	25th August.	1st September.	fin   ...	3.55	9.76	2.56New York and North thereof.......... -i	Out ...	3.49	4.62	4.59	c Total	3.52	6.88	3.75	&apos;In   ...	4.27	16.03	5.29South of New York, West Indies, &amp;c.

This remarkable reduction is largely due to the Scheme of Control and Protection of Fishing Vessels which was sanctioned by the War Cabinet in April last and is now in full operation.The losses of Merchant Vessels of Allies, other than British, do not show the same tendency to diminish, but a very substantial reduction in the losses of Neutral Merchant Vessels has taken place in the last two months.-.: The total losses of all vessels are less in August both as regards number and tonnage than in any previous month since the unrestricted use of enemy submarines commenced, and the progressive reduction in losses during the last two months is greater than can be -accounted for by the reduction due to enemy action of total tonnage afloat.(0.600)
CONVOYS.850 ships have been convoyed this week as compared with 771 last week ; 9 of these were lost as against 6 last week and 3 the previous week. Two of the 9, however, had lost touch with their convoy owing to a gale in the Atlantic, only 6.-ships out of 20 remaining with the convoy. The comparative numbers and percentages of losses in convoy are shown in the following tables, from which it will be seen that the percentage of losses on the inward convoy shows an increase this week : Losses in Convoy.Inwards.	4		Week ended 1st		Total since commence-		Week ended 25th August.

The result of the engagement was that four of the latter ran themselves on shore, and it is probable that they will become a total loss.The weather has on the whole been unfavourable for air operations. Bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on enemy aerodromes at St. Denis Westrem and Ghistelles, and on Ostend-Thourout railway. The total weight of bombs dropped was 9  tons.R.N.A.S. patrols from Dunkirk have driven down one enemy aeroplane.MOVEMENTS OF GERMAN MERCHANT SHIPS.To and from Norwegian Ports : Arrived, 7 ; Left, 7.

The Russian S.N.O. is entirely occupied with Committees of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates,-while his subordinates are without authority and lack energy.&quot; It is feared that this report is true.... Qn August 24th there was an attack by enemy aircraft on the Russian air stations on the Baltic island of Osel. A British steamer is reported to have been sunk during the attack. ,The situation in S.W. Russia has become such that orders have been given to hasten the work on the four light cruisers under construction at Nikolaev (Black Sea), in case it is necessary to evacuate the town.The news on Naval matters from Russia is&apos;meagre, but the British Attache is being changed, and arrangements are being made to obtain more information.Naval Staff,Qlh September, 1917. .
