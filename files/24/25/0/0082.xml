His Britannic &apos;M a j e sty ?s G o v er n m e n t.)(This Document is the Property ofSECRET.Department of Information Intelligence Bureau,(1)The Name &quot;TuranianTuran is the Persian name for the steppes of Central Asiain&apos;.contrast to the settled country of Iran or Persia, and nineteenthcentury philologists coined the word Turanianjto cover the &quot;agglutinative&quot; languages of north-eaartern Europe and Asia, in contrast to the Indo-European family.It was the Magyars,, an isolated Turanian-speaking people; who first started the idea of a political Fanturanian movement as a counterblast to PanslaVism.     The Magyars have preached Panturanian-ism to the Ottoman Turks since &amp;876, and to the ^ulgars since their bfeach with Russia, but neither the Bulgars or the Osmanlis have taken it up in the Magyar sense.     The Bulgars, notwithstanding art Turanian element in their origin, are a Slavonic-speaking nation, and Turkish, though philologically related to the Ugro-Finnic gmmp of the Turanian family, to which Magyar belongs, is too remote to produce a practical sense of kinshio between the speakers of the two languages.     The Turks and Bulgars regard their rapnroche-ment with each other and with the I-lagyars simply as an opportunist political alliance against certain Slavonic States which are common enemies of all three.     The attitude of the Turks towards &quot;Turanian&quot; nations in Europe is quite unsentimental.     The cardinal point in the policy of the C.U.P. is to obtain the maximum material assistance from all European nations , end at the same time to re-:duee to a minimum the control of any European nation over the Ottoman Empire..The Ottoman Turks have, ^rcv?r. seized upon the name,.
&quot;pahturanian&quot;- to express a new idea of their own.Panturkism. Dialects of the Turkish group of the ^jianiaid family, are sroken over avast area, extending (with certain breaks) from   Constantinople to the Cobi desert and the Arctic Ocean.     These dialects are about as closely related as the branches of the Slavonic group in the Indo-European family, and it is natural th?t the development of national consciousness amon^the Ottoman Turks whould be accompanied by a Panturkish consciousness,    just as Russian nationalism and Panslavism arose simultaneously in Russia a century ago.(8)     Turkish Nationalism in the Ottoman Empire.There are gotaething less thart&quot; S million Turks in the Ottoman Empire - about half a million in Constantinople and the remainder forming a fairly compact block in the Anatolian Peninsula; but the Ottoman State was not originally built upon a Turkish national basis.     Till a century ago, its strength rested on con-quered populations in Europe, and the Turkish-speaking provinces of Anatolia, which had been independent states and bitter rivals of the Osmanlis, were comparatively recent and neglected acquisitions of the Ottoman Empire.     But during the 19th century though the capital of the Ottoman Empire has remained at Constantinople its centre of gravity has shifted from the Balkan Peninsula to Anatolia owing to three causes:-   (n) loss of territory in Europe; (b) increased control in Asia by the Central Government; (c) the substitution of a conscript army for a hereditary professional army descended from Christian converts (the Janissaries, destroyed in 1826).     This conscript army is recruited nominally from all Moslem subjects of. the Empire, and, since the Revolution of 1908, from . Jews and Christians as well;v In prnctioe it has depended (till the present war) upon the Turks of Anatolia, who were the most amenable
recruits, the best fighting material, and the most easily mobilised on the most: threatened frontiers, which^had hitherto been those in Europe.Thus the Ottoman Empire had come to rest actually upon a basis of Turkish nationality before a conscious Turkish national movement began.     The first nationalist organisation was formed, after the Revolution, at Salonika in 1909.     Its leaders were doctrinaires. Their first object was to purge the Tsnakish language of its Persian and Arabic borrowings (more than 50,C of the vocabulary), and they even attacked the Mohammedan Religion.   - a step which was far in advance of ordinary Turkish opinion, and which the C.U.P. would have been much too prudent to follow. ^  ^.This new Turkish nationalism received a wide^ and a more polit-ical complexion from the disastrous Balkan %r of 1913-3.     The -results of this war completed the metamorphosis of the Ottoman State which had been in process for a century, and produced a corres-ponding change in the consciousness of the Turkish nation - now stimulated by the shock of defeat.     After the Balkan War the Osmanlis more or less consciously abandoned the tradition of being a dominant race in Europe;   resolved to develoo their national possibilities in ^natolia,   and conceived the ambition of compen-sating for lost alien subjects in Europe by attracting to themselves the scattered branches of the Turkish race outside the Ottoman Empire.The national movement now took on a more practical form. Societies were founded (with branches in the Caucasus and Central/ney attempted to publish a Turkish translation of the Koran, and have played with the idea of abandoning Islam in favour of primitive Turkish paganism./:
Asia) to..promote education, physical culture, the emancipation of women, and tfcei^ constructive aims, and the Ottoman Government began to lend its support - chiefly through the Ministry of Aukaf or Religious Endowments.     Turkish Panturanianism now pursued two distinct aims:-   (a) Turkifieation inside the Ottoman Empire and (b) Turkish Irredentism outside it.     But it is important to distinguish the attitude of the C.U.P. towards Panturanianism from the policy of the doctrinaires.(3)    The Polioy of the C.U.P.The C.U.P. care only secondarily; for Turkish nationalism. Phelr first concern is for the Ottoman State, and they have takenttntmmmm   *    &quot;     i. &apos; mini., ii.....m......n    m . i i ., i&apos; . n i, , m i   nin.......      I In I ilm i. i       .    11 i mmfim........... I i f lup ppnturanianism as an instrument to this end.Their programme in 1908 was to strengthen the Ottoman Emoire internally by democratisation, and they ignored the problem of nationality until their first policy was wrecked by it.     But the secession of the last non-Turkish populations of the Empire in Europe (in the Balkan V/ar) and the strong particularism of the Arabs, Armenians /and Constantinopolitan-\natolian Greeks ( in the new Ottoman Parliament) struck both at the integrity of the Empire and at its centralisation.     The -\natolian Turks were the only nationality in the Emoire who were not OTvoosed to centralisation and who had no incompatible loyalty to another political idea.     It was therefore natural that, after the Balkan -7ar, the C.U.P. should come to regard Turkish nationalism, rather than &quot;liberty, eouality and fraternity&quot;, as the best instrument for achieving their aims.The theoretical do-ctrines-cf-Turkish Penturanianism can be gathered from &quot;The Turkish and .Psnturkish Ideal&quot; by &quot;Tekin Alp&quot; (Albert Cohen,     Salonika Jew), translated and circulated 0by the Admiralty Intelligence B vision.     The Panturanianism of the C.U.P. can only be judged by their political actions.
Upt they have never followed it as. an end: to itself.     The first    .;\ object.of the doctrinaires is to free the Turkish culture from tfee-Arabic linguistic influence;    the first object of the C.U.P. is to free the Ottoman State from European political control.     The doctrinaires work for the Turkish nationality in Anatolia by educa-tion and social reform, the C.U.P. by the extermination of Greeks and Armenians and the settlement of &quot;Muhadjivs&quot; (Turkish refugees from the lost provinces in Europe) in their place.     The doctrinaires think in abstract terms of Imperialism verstV&quot; Irredentisra;    the C.U.P. wish to&apos; compensate for the territory, population and prestige they lost in the P^lkan War by gains in the present war in Asia and Africa.     Bittftlly tfo&amp;*  doctrinaires believe that Islam and thx Turkish national genius afrd fundamentally incompatible, while yv&apos;:. O.U.P. wish to exploit Panturanianism and Panislamism simul-taneously.In their internal policy the C.U.P. incline to Panturanianism, for common language is a better basis than common religion for the modern highly organised military state into which they hope to rer^ form the Ottoman Empire.     At the CU.P.Congress of 1911 it was resolved that the subject nationalities &quot;may keep their religion tut not their language&quot;- a complete reversal of the traditional Ottoman policy.In foreign policy, on the other hand, the Ottoman Empire has more to gain from the Panislamic movement initiated by Abd-ul-Hamid. the CU.P. have therefore continued the Hamidian policy in this sphere without letting Panturanianism stand in their way.Panislamism is.a political movement.     It appeals to Moslem populations under European government, and Moslem States under European control, which aspire to be independent and to play a part in the world.     The Panislamic propaganda encourages these Moslems
to look to Turkey as: an existing Islamic Great Power,;; which Iback&apos;their Efforts towards liberation and afford them a rallying point when liberation is achieved.     But by repudiating Islam the panturanian doctrinaires break the moral bond between the Ottoman [Empire and the Islamic world;   while by preaching Turkish Irredentism they tha?daten the integrity of ancient Islamic States like Persia and Afghanistan, which contain important Turkish minorities in their population.     Therefore, in their policy towards Persia, for example, during the present warm the C.U.P. have held fast to Panislamism and let Panturanianism go.     They have encouraged the Persian Nationalists I to oppose Russia and Britain, and have suggested an Islamic alliance &apos; of the&apos; Persian and Ottoman Stats-3.     But they have not preached Turkish nationalism to the Turks in Persia, for that would have driven the Persians into their enemies&apos; arms.(4)     Prospects of Turkish Irredentism Abroad.There are about 27 million Turks in the world, of whom 8 millions live in the Ottoman Emoire, 16 millions in the Russian Empire, and about 3 million in other States.     It is therefore clear that the C.U.P. c?n only take up Panturanianism as a Turkish irredentist nolicy (a) in so far as it does not clash with Panislamism and (b) in so far as they are given opportunities by the course of events in Russia.The chief Turkish-speaking groups outside the Ottoman Empire are these(a)   The Tatars of Kazan (and Astrakhan):   About 1 \ mi11ions; they live on the Volga, almost surrounded by Russians and Finns; have been uis.der Russian Government more than three centnuies, and ere bound up with Russia economically;   are at present ahead of other Turkish groups in culture (the Ottoman Turks included), and;are looked to as leaders&apos;by the other Turks in the Russian Empire.        .
(a). The Tatars of Crimea, (under 200,000).and (e) of -7estern Siberia (about 50,000):   Follow;the lead of Kazan.;(a.)   The Tatars of the Caucasus:  lb out 2 millions;   more backward than the Kazan Tatars or the Anatolian Turks;   at present under the influence of Kazan, but drAwn towards the Anatolians by geographical proximity and common enmity towards the Armenians.     Their centre i3 Baku, which has a great industrial future, and will probably suoplant Kazan in the ?. eadership of the Turks in Russia.     Geographically, Baku is suited to &apos;be the focus of all the Turks in the woria, and the Baku fltetes have already produced several remarkable personalities.(e) The Turks of Northern Persia;   Scattered, and without Turkish consciousness;   they are Shies, and have adopted-^Persian culture and Persian nationalism;   they are most numerous in the Province of Azerbaijan, only separated from the Caucasus by an artificial fron-tier, and if they ever break away from Persia they will gravitate towards Baku.(f) The Turk3 of Northern Afghanistan:   Only annexed half a century ago, but apparantly without Turkish consciousness.(g) The Turks of Central Asir: About IS millions, of whom 12 millions are under Russia, the remainder under China;   Occupy a vast continuous territory from the Caspian Sea and the Urals to the Altai, and frov-,the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Pamirs;   in many different stages of civilisation, but linked by the Russian administration and Russian railways with each other  .nd with the Turks elswehere.(h) The Yakuts:   250,000, in north-eastern Siberia;   pagans or nominal Christians, quite cut off geographically from the rest of the Turkish race.Ottoman Turkish Irredentism in(e) Persia and (f) Ifghanistan is ruled out by P^nislamism.     In the other cases it depends on the fate of the Russian Empire.    If Russia becomes a federal republic, she will
Be .the greatest free Turkish State in the world.   Kazan, and then Baku, will be the political centres of her Turkish population, and ultimately, perhaps, of Turks in other countries as well.     If, on the other hand, there is either anarchy in Russia or a repression of the noh-Russian nationalities, the Russian Empire may partially break up.     For geographical reasons the breakup would hardly extend; to (a) Kazan, (b) Crimea, or (c) Siberia;   but the Caucasian Tatars might be incorporated in the Ottoman Empire, and the C.U.P. might organise the Central Asiatic block into an indepdndent Turco-Moslem-State under Ottoman hegemony.     In this instance the Panturanian and Panislamic policies would he in harmony, and the change womld be Intensely prejudicial to the position of Great Britain in India.(5)   Prospects of Turkification in the Ottoman Empire, (a)   In the Arab Provinces.&apos;The Panturanian cultural attack on the Arabic element in the Turkish language has led. on to a political attack on the Arab nationality in the Ottoman Empire,     Y/e can convict individual Turkish writers, officials and officers of anti-Arab sentiments and acts and this makes excellent propaganda for the British Arab move-ment.     But it is not easy to convict the C.U.P. as a whole of an anti-Arab policy.     The starving out of the Lebanan was a blew, not at the Arabs, but at local autonomy;   Syrian Arab notables have been executed, not because they were Arab nationalists, but because their nationalism took the form of hostility to the Ottoman State.     The C.U.P. have bungled their Arab nolicy, but it is not too late for them to reverse it.   They have come to      understanding with the        Imam in the Yemen;   they are making overtures to Kia^* Hussein in the Hejaz;   and it is rumoured that they are going to grant autonomy to Syria.   The first object of the CU.P. is to
laintain their position as an Islamic Great Power.     Supoosing peace y/ere made on the basis .of the present war map, the centre of gravity of the Empire would ultimately shift, for military and economic reasons, from.Anatolia to the remaining Arab provinces (Syria and northern Mesopotamia), and under these circumstances the C.U.P. would probably take the Arabs into partnership, as Austria took the Magyars in 1867. Reconstructed as a Turco-Arab Dual State, the Ottoman Empire would compete with France and Britain for.the allegiance of tthe Arab race, not only in Mesopotamia and Arabia but in Egypt and Worth Africa. . This would create a very awkward Situation for British policy in the Middle.East, and we cannot rely on the Panturanianism of the C.U.P. to prevent it from arising, since the C.U.P. are Real-Politiker and not doctrinaires, (b)   In Anatolia.The Turkish language was already eliminating the non-Turkish languages in Anatolia before the War..     By the Armenian massacres and Greek deportations, the C.U.P. have now eliminated the n&apos;ti-Turkish cultures as well, and after the war Anatolia will have to start at the Turkish low-water-mark.If the Ottoman Empire, remains a great power, the Anatolian Turk will doubtless be sacrificed to Ottoman Imperialism, as he has always been before.     If it is confined to Anatolia, there may be a genuine regeneration of the Turkish nationality there, like the regeneration of the Balkan nationalities since their liberation.     In Anatolia the process will be feebler and more slow, but if the Russian Empire is federalised and the Ottoman Empire broken up, the Tatars of RussiaAnd almost certainly the Kurds, whose national consciousness is undeveloped, and who have always been bulwarks of the Ottoman State.
may.play the same beneficent part in the risorgimento of the Anatolian Turks as the Russians themselves have played in the history of the Balkan Slavs.     This is the only form in which the&quot; realisation of the Panturanian Idea is either probable or desirable.7.9.17A.J.T.
