VI. &apos;i$SM  j 3 (5 September, 1917),yMThe Pact of Corfu and the Austrian Jugoslavs.The reception accorded to the news of the Corfu Pact by the Jugoslav press in Austria is naturally an ambiguous one, Newspapers have   learnt to be discreet in their comments in cases where there is grave danger of incurring charges of high treason.   The gist of comment on the Pact is that the Jugoslav parties of Austria-Hungary abide by their Constitutional Declaration in the Austrian Reichsrat on May 30 in which they declared for union of the whole race under the Rabsburg Crown. &quot;We Jugoslavs will be united and free in free Austria in an allied State of free peoples under the Habsburg dynasty.     An end must be put to the grievous foreign hegemony of the Germans and Magyars&quot;&apos;.     It is. obvious that these two sentences are mutually contradictory, for a union of all the Jugoslavs of Austria-Hungary in one State would break up the whole frame-work of the Dual Monarchy and is not contemplated by any German or Magyar party.     The Jugoslavs, in declaring for union, ipso facto contemplate a break-up of Austria-Hungary, but are wise enough to formulate their demands in the least dangerous a^xi objectionable way possible.Apart from this there is, however, some genuine criticism of the Pact.   The Slovene press - e.g. papers like Edinost and Slovenec - formulate two main objections to the terms of the Pact.       (The further objection that Dr Trumbid had &quot;no mandate&quot; to speak for the Jugoslavs as a whole is rather
awhole is rather a question of tactics).       These objectionsare:    .(l) That the Pact declares for a unitary, not a federal    -State such as was expected.(2) That there is no explicit assurance that a large -v section of the Slovene people will not be abandonedto Italy. /:^v-^r^XThere is, however, no slackening in the resolute attitude of the Jugoslav parties in demanding full self-determination.     A member of the Starcevic party - Hrvoj -declared on August 9 in the Croatian Diet that &quot;if the Germans and Magyars will not themselves put an end to their hegemony then we shall not be to blame if others (i.e. the Entente Powers) come and put an end to it against their will&quot;.It does not fall within the scope of this Report to deal further with the party differences in the Croatian Diet, but it-may be noted that the only group in it which resolutely opposes the united Jugoslav idea is the small pro-Austrian ultra-clerical party of Dr Prank.Italo-Serblan Relations.This question is dealt with in Weekly Reports on Italy, DC and\ X.   The fact that Italian opinion is now alive to the necessity for a rapprochement is shown by the amount of space accorded by &quot;Italian papers - e.g. the Secolo and Gazzetta del Popolo - to interviews with various Jugoslav leaders.   An improved tone in official relations is shown by the attendance of Serbian and Italian official representatives at the consecration of the memorial to Serbian soldiers at Valona on August 15.
As was to be expected,-Mr Radovie and the Montenegrin ommittee of National Union have expressed their strong approval f the Corfu Pact.,9.17.AV&quot;AL
