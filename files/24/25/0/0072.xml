NIGHT AIR RAIDS ON LONDON. :/&apos;/J.(Memo, by Lt. General J. C Smuts, issued in. accordance with War Cabinet 228, Minute 6.)The recent night air-raids on the London area have formed the subject of repeated discussion between the Air Board, the:-Home Defence Staff, and myself, and it will be useful to sum-marise the principal considerations and conclusions provisionally ocme to.It is interesting to note how the enemy is changing the form of his attack as our defence develops..   In view cf our defences and his consequent losses,he is no&apos; longer repeating the Zeppelin night attacks.   Again, since the sensational aeroplane day raid&apos; on London last &quot;July our defences against that form of attack have been rapidly pushed forward, and in their recent attemptsthe raiders have not been able to pene-trate the line of our coast defences by day.. ,&apos;- . &apos;&apos;The enemy has now at   last resorted to the.form of attack which our air commanders have long anticipated, and which&apos;it is most difficult to meet - viz. night attacks by aeroplanes. Thi3 form of attack we have for a long tine now been carrying out with comparative impunity against his aerodromes, depots, bases, and lines of communication in France and Belgium. Almost every ni-^ht tons of explosives are dropped by our aero-planes on these objectives, and the enemy has as yet developed no means of meeting this attack.   Again, the enemy not infre-quently crosses our lines at the front by night for the purpose of bombing objectives in our rear, and it is admitted&apos; that,so far no form of defence against these raids has proved adequate.Although the recent night attacks on London were made in bright moon-ii,^ht. there is no. reason why such attacks should not be attempted even on dark ni^ihts^ so long as other weather conditions are favourable.   The line of the Thames would furnish sufficient guidance to the raiders even on a dark night, and the working of our search-lights- would indicate to them even at a great distance the total London area for which they are making; but of course it would not be possible for them to distinguish any particular: locality or objective under such conditions, and the bombing-,would have to be general instead of being directed to specific objectives.   Cloudy, rainy or uncertain weather would form very unfavourable con-, ditions for ni^ht raids, and no development of this form&apos; of attack on London on any very lar^e scale.need be anticipated until next spring and summer,&apos;-.-although repetitions of these attacks should, be anticipated as ion^ as the autumn weather remains favourable,. and there:is, consequently time to develop our&apos;metnods of countering.-, these &apos; attacks. w.-/;-[gj C RE :T..   -&apos;-&apos;&apos;f,..T. ^1971.; -, ; :&apos; WAR CABINET.&apos;
So long as we are adopting merely defensive measures, Jf-n      wftflt difficult to prevent these raids, ^ndeIhey ma/ v n^ssume large?Uprcpor?ions. and inflict more 522^5 and destruction.than hitherto.

Just...as. well .haVe remainedvv on-the ground.     They are at night useful only against:very large and&apos;conspicuous objectives, like.Zeppelins   once, these have been picked up by them.     On.moonlight: nights out anti-aircraft guns are not much userither,. as the moonlight neu-tralisesthe search-lights and makes it very difficult for them to pick up the enemy aeroplanes.   In.raids on dark nights both search-lights and anti-aircraft guns could be used more effectively.Hitherto only two measures of defence,have -been, suggested against these night raids, both of which will .be tried in the.-London area.   &apos; The first is&quot; the use of more powerful search-lights, whose blinding effect on the pilots will, it is hoped, .be such that it will be impossible for them to navigate their machines.     A certain number of theBe powerful, searchlights are now being secured both from France and from the Navy.-It must, however, be seen how fat it will be possible for the enemy pilots to neutralise their effect by wearing smoked glasses.The second means of defence which has been suggested and with which experiments are now being made is the establishment of a wire screen suspended from balloons and intended to- form .. a sort of barrage in which the enemy machines navigated at- -. night Will be caught.     It is said that a similar device at.-Venice has been useful against Austrian night raids.     At -Venice light balloons are used from each of which (at a height., of about 10,000 feet) a wire hangs suspended, a sufficient . number of such balloons and wires forming the. screen or barrage. . with larger balloons connected together it may be possible toiSIS P2LSSiyA^rPend^cula]i: ^ut arso cross and with: this -idea General Ashmore is now experimenting.

Every :raid should be followed by an official notification of its lessons.It is possibie that a development of these attacks on a larger scale and consequent loss of life may hereafter justify the adoption of further measures and even of a certain amount of compulsiohf either under Martial Lav; or the Defence of the Realm Acts.:. But so far it cannot be said that the public have unduly ignored the notices and warnings issued to than, and it would be premature at this stage to adopt drastic measures., Careful attention should be/given to the probability of the enemy resorting in-future raids to the:use of gas shells on a larger scale than hitherte, and to the proper measures that should be taken and suitable notices that should be issued to provide against, such a contingency.      It may be necessary in the above notices to provide for-the closing of windows and doors until not only the raid is passed but also the danger of gassing is passed. At any rate it is a real danger against which it would be wise to take precautions:in time.       As gas shells are largely used by the GiftfcKjyat the front, we have full information as to the measure of. gassing -that might be expected from an air raid in the neighbourhood of crowded houses or ar^as.It is felt that the above-mentioned asthods of defence touch only the fringe of the danger of these night attacks, and that in such cases the only proper defence is offence.   We can only defend thid island effectively against air attacks by tffensive measures, by attacking the enemy in his air bases on the Continent and in that way destroying his power of afcHxjklng us across the Channel.       Information has just come into our possession as to the site of the Gotha aerodromes., and: orders for attacking them have already.been given,.     The larger question of our future   air, offeneive will be dealt with in another nemorandm(Int)    J,C,,S.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 6th Sept. 1917,
