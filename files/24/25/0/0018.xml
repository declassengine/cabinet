(This Document    the Pmnfir-ty 0fneral Delme Radcliffe, Italy.William Robertson, C.I.G.S.,War Office.August 31st 1917.Hondo a in 1.45 p. in.362. August 31st. personal and Secret.I am desired by General Cadorna to inforn you as follows:-He has decided, in consequence of the strength of the enemy -positions, that it is necessary to divide the future operations into two phases in order to permit of a concentration of as much artillery as possible in succession on the SAINT GABRlJi)LjiJ SAINT MARCO position and on the K3RMAJJA position.    The resumption of offensive on one of these objectives will be about September 15th. and on the other about October 1st.local actions will continue especially at the North end of BAIHSIZ2A Plateau towards TOLMINO.    It is pointed out by General Cadorna that the success of the operations is mainly an artillery imestion.,   About 250,000 rounds of heavy ammunition will accumulate during each fortnight of September in augmentation of the figures given in my telegram No. 352 and the first possible use will be made of this stock.   He says however that if any new circumstances may have caused you to modify the views already expressed by you as to the possibility of sending any further artillery to Italy now and if by any possibility some more British artillery and ammunition should bo available to increase force of British artillery operating here he would be most grateful to receive any reinforcements hov/ever small of the kind as, in consequence of the prolongation of the period of offensive, such a reinforcement could still arrive in time to take useful part in it..
