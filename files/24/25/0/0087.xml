IT-1983 u.0.   ^(This&quot;Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic MajestyJs. Governmeri10380The following is a translation of two Austro-Kungarian documents captured by the Italians. She first Is signed by -. General der infanterie Arz yon Straussenburg,, the\Cnief of the General Staff of the Austre-Hungarian Forces.-&apos; The second.was the covering order accompanying the di stributlon of, the former to the officers of the 11th Army (operating in the Trentino)by its commander General of Artillery Scheuchenstuel.R. Supreme Command ,43503.of the day for officers.G, H. 4.3nd--August,&quot;, 1917.:it is easily understood that after 3 years of war &quot;both \ Officers and privates, ardently.;desire peace.,The. firm resolve to. cdhtinus the struggle must however,, &quot;prevent tni.sT:quite. comprehensible desire for peace from passing;.;..: certain limlte which I shell now&quot; define.&apos; I base these remarks on certain, observations which I was. able to make myself at the Front. :. \.i    ;      -V;.--- .--        .......       \&apos;l - -I address myself in all sincerity to officers of all ranks, be cause I realise more than, ever that they form, the .   r.;.; . backbone of the /army and have., incalculable influence on-the,morale and mind. of. the rank and&apos; filei&apos; &apos; - - ;&apos;;;I. wish to point &quot;put first of all that a great part of    .. the army considers that we ,have already attained the objects .with which we .entered:.the war and that we still .continue to fight . without knowing^hy arid what,.for. . /This opinion.which penalizes -all power of action was strengthened: by various political . -happenings in pur Kingdom and&apos;in the Allied German  iwpire and especially by the discussion on the aims of the war.   The idea . arose that the responsibility lay solely.with us and that very little yielding on our side was necessary to obtain a possible peace.    The only thing to say of such ideas is that those who express them have been caught in the toils of enemy lies. certainly have attained our war aims;   but the enemy on the west and south-western fronts are by so much the further from gaining theirs.   Our rulers as far back as last December stretched out their hands to their enemies;   a few months later our Government gave utterance to most moderate and peaceful declarations; Germany followed our example and the Iraperial Chancellor and the deputies offered golden opportunities to the enemy.Our great success alone made it impossible for our public and secret overtures to be interpreted as a sign of weakness.But all was in vaini   The ene:T\y would not even consider preliminary negotiations.Sven when the Russian revolution seemed to pave the way towards an understanding and the Central IsmpireB offered freely to the Russian nation that which she was striving to obtain by internal risings, the machinations of the Allies and the U.S.A. frustrated all possibility of peace.The
The people at the head of the ISntente Powers have in this war staked their all upon.one card.     Peace with compromise or make-shift peace might he useful in saving the lives of their people hut politically it would mean disaster.   This opinion is 4confirmed by numerous speeches and documents both public and confidential.   The only peace we could obtain te-day from our enemies would be a dishonourable and humiliating one.Enemy treaties &apos;giving Southern Tyrol, Trieste and the Adriatic shores to treacherous Italy, almost all the Hungarian territory up to the Theiss to Roumania, treaties which would bring about the destruction of the Kingdom have still the same power in the chancellories of London, Paris and Rome as they   . had last year.This does not mean that such treaties may not, even tomorrow, become worthless scraps of paper.In the meanwhile we can be quite satisfied with the news which reaches us from enemy countries.   Prance is profoundly discontented and places all her hopes in American aid;   the results of submarine warfare both against Italy and England have exceeded all expectation.     A mere nothing may suffice to unchain forces which will bring us at a bound to our goal.In the meanwhile neither we nor the Austro-Hungarian Government nor our Allies can take any further steps towards securing peace.     The struggle of our soldiers, under the leadership of their brave and experienced officers, will be continued to-day as it has been for 3 years;   it is a fight for the very existence of our Kingdom.   Let every officer bear this in mind and impress it upon his men.&apos;Let him also remember what I have said above, unless he wishes to jeopardise the results obtained by the blood of thousands of his gallant companions.The deep comprehension our Emperor and King has of his royal duties and his true love for his people are sufficient pledge that he will not let the war continue a single day longer than is rendered necessary by honour and love for the Fatherland.In the meanwhile we must remain firm in our resolve to. win, taking the brunt of the work upon ourselves and;exercising our influence on our brother-soldiers.(Signed)     Arz ra.p.
