(This Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)OPERATIONSSEC RE T.From:-   General Barter, Russia.To: -C.I.G.SWar Office.5/9/17.12,18 a.m.1229,Sept. 4th.   Riga retirement still continues.   It is a repetition of the Tarnapol disaster, Russians flying in all directions.   Russian Siberian Corps on right flank still more or less in order,     2nd Siberian and 43rd practically non-existent.     The improvised reserve consists of 7 fresh divisions, and 2 more are coming up.    It is intended to halt on line Zalosmionade Venden joining Bvina at Glazmanka. The Jacopstadt is being vacated.   There is no reason to suppose Venden line will be held.   German strength is unknown: but It is supposed to be about 7 divisions. Losses in material are not known but few supplies have been lost&apos;as main depot was at Venden.    It seems doubtful if it can be evacuated in time.    It is considered very probable that the Germans will attempt a landing in force near Revel,Panic reported;at Petrograd.    Kerensky arrives here tomorrow to confer with Korniloff,   The,political change, which I have already foretold, and v/hich in my opinion may be the only way to save Russia as an active ally, may be expected at any moment.
