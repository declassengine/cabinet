4?ft        J(/ - -WAR CABIHET.SECRETG.T.1920.Memorandum by the Rt. Hon. George EL Barnes la.p.The Coal Controller called to see me on the 31st.August at my request, and gave me the following information on the 3ub ject of coal supplies.The President of the Board of Trade some time ago advised that private consumers should store coal.    This advice has &quot;been acted upon.   In normal times the supply^of coal in London is as 40 to 60 during the light summer months and the heavy winter months; hut the 3upply now. &quot;being taken is as large as that of last winter.The system under which the Coal Controller has been working is that the larger consumer must he rationed.    He has working with him a Committee which has helped him considerably in effecting this purpose.    The coal merchants&apos;are inclined to be nervous that the local authorities might be brought in to assist in rationing; and the Ccal Controller has pointed out that;-.if Viiuy only play their part properly^ it will not be necessary for any intervention by the local authorities.Shortage of cartage facilities is really one of the great-est difficulties.    In normal times 10,000 men were employed in London in carrying coal; but this number has been depleted by the recruitment of at least 4,000 coal porters.    The work could not be done by women, unless the weight of the- sacks was reduced; but the shortage of sacks towing to the fact that canvas is no longer obtainable) renders this course impracti-cable.-  - .   - , / &apos;_ ** - ,At the beginning of 3^t&quot;Ve&quot;ar the Coal Controller started a scheme for the re-dietributicn of coal, to prevent supplies being carried longer distances than was necessary,     Por example he found that coal was being transported from Durham to Ply-mouth, whereas it could be obtained from South Yorkshire or Staffordshire.At the present time the London area is getting 20,000 ton3 a week more than was the case last year.I enquire,as to the supply of coal for Ireland,, and Mr.Calthrop stated that Ireland was obtaining coal from the Western ports; supplies are no longer drawn from iaV-;vi. On an average, two million tons a year is supplied, at tne rate of 40,000 tons a weeK.I also asked about the southern ports and Glasgow, and Mr,Calthrop intimated that Glasgow was better off than it was last year, and, although there is some difficulty about the transport at the southern ports, he will have the matter dealt w? iht.   But he has no misgivings on the matter.Public Utility companies, such as the Metropolitan Water Board and the Gas Companies   hsve now in store 1,350,000 tons, as against 950,000 tons a year ago.     Some increase in the amount required by the Gas Companies may be occasioned by the installation of gas fires; but, speaking generally, they have ten week&apos;a store in hand and the position is safe as regards public utility companies for at least half the winter.
The delivery of coal in &quot;bulk having &quot;been to 3ome-extent effected in the sianaer, it will &quot;be possible-to set free the delivery staff for the local domestic delivery . o^f coal.   At the present time, there is an increase of 20.000 tons a week in the amount of coal brought into London.     Last week-alone 101,000 tons was brought in.Mr.Calthrop hps xaao-e arrangements -that Supplies in bulk should be taken for tenements, and the coal will, then be doled ait.to the various occupiers.   This -has been done by agreement with the Lr C. C. in the case of big housing trusts, sach as the Peabody and Guineas Trusts.   He has inserted in the agreement a clause (of doubtfullegality) to the effect that,provided the tenant agreed, the taking of supplies in bulk would be enforced upon the owner. The legality of this clause has not been questioned.     It-meets the obvious difficulty that the occupiers of tehementB cannot store io^lon mocoiint of the lack of the necessary.; accommodation.In all his operations, the Coal Controller is most anxious to avoid doing anything that might result in the -foundation of. coal queues, at stations and elsewhere.A certain amount of trouble may be caused by the.&apos; Coal Porters1 Trade Union,owfeng to--the fact that men working on trolleys often make as much, as  5. or-  6 a week, and if bad weather sets in, they may not choose.to.work a full week.The Coal Controller, has hopes of maintaining the summer prices (which range from 35/6 for the best,coal.to 27/- for the poorest quality) during the winter.An agreement has recently been arrived at under which not more than one ton a week will be de44-ve.red, during Sept-ember.-;^ any one householder, p ,       ^^/-^..-       &quot;- &quot; - C   - St*.  /J2.0 afinally, Kr.Calthrop stated that, provided there were no strikes, not only in connection with the minc3 and coal -porters, but also on the railways, he uaw no reason why any poor person 3hould lack a fire during the forthcoming winter.G.
