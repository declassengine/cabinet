(This Document is the Property of/3His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.] WEEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA. XV.(1 September, 1917).DBW/015.The General Situation.Both Tsar Ferdinand and Mr Radoslavov have again been travelling in the Central Empires.     The Prime Minister left Sofia on August 5.   Before going he received a deputation of leading Bulgarian journalists and gave them a survey of the general situation.     He made the now usual declaration that Bulgaria had won and intended to keep all her natural irredenta:    that in this she was supported by her Allies, and that the few voices of opposition raised in Austria and Germany to this course were &quot;quite without importance&quot;.     He also assured the journalists that the economic situation was very good indeed both in Bulgaria and in the Allied countries.    It is interesting to note that the vote of thanks to Mr Radoslavov for his pronouncement was moved by Mr Peyev (editor of the Mir) who used to enjoy the reputation of being a strong Russophil.In spite of the rosy light in ^hich the Prime Minister set forth the economic situation, it does not appear to be so wonder-fully brilliant.   The food qjestion is still a serious one, and the papers are day by day full of lists of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment and to fines for holding up food and charging illegally high prices.     The &quot;Broad&quot; Socialist organ Narod complains that the economic power of the country is being crippled by the emigration of large numbers of youths, age from 14 to 16, to Germany.     It is true that they will there learn much, but there is no guarantee that they will return to Bulgaria. The Narod asks the Government to take measures against the country being crippled by lack of labour.
Bulgaria and her Allies.The opposition in certain German Socialist /quarters to Bulgaria&apos;s chauvinist \:av aims is continued.   The Deputy Hermann Wendel, in the Arbeiter Zeitung of Vienna, returns to the subject of these war aims.   He insists that the Bulgarians are quite unjustified in demanding a territorial common frontier with Austria-Hungary or the possession of any part of the Morava Valley or Old Serbia.     Moreover, he proceeds once again to show at length that even Macedonia is by no means a Bulgarian province racially, and that the Slav population of it cannot fairly be styled either Serb or Bulgar for it is half v/ay between the two. He therefore once again recommends a fair settlement of the Macedonian question by agreement between Serbia and Bulgaria. As usual this article has aroused great indignation in Bulgaria.Propaganda Abroad;The &quot;Alliance of Bulgarian Savants, Yfriters and Artists&quot;, the foundation of which was described In Weekly Report V, is re-doubling its activities.    It has sent off representatives to Vienna, Berlin, Stockholm and Switzerland in the attempt to influence allied, neutral and enemy opinion in favour of the recognition of Bulgaria1s territorial demands.     Bulgarian agents are especially active in Switzerland just at present, but they are by no means unchecked.     A great deal has been done in bringing their activities to light by the Serbian Bureau at Geneva.Two books recently published in French may do a great deal to give the general public a more accurate idea of Bulgarian internal and foreign policy during the last two years.     One, a small brochure &quot;La Bulgarie en Guerre&quot; by Leon Savadjian, a Bulgarised Armenian journalist who left Sofia in October 1915, and has since been working for the Serbians at Geneva, gives *
in a few pages some very useful facts as to the character of Bulgarian political intrigues.A larger book by Victor Kuhne called &quot;Les Bulgares peints par eux-memes&quot; gives by means of quotations from the Bulgarian press during the last two years a very full and accurate pictur of the attitude of the various political parties in Bulgaria.1,9.17.
