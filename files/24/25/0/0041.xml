Engineer for Civil Administration. Since despatch of former, I have been called upon by Army Commander to submit my views urgently from the point of view of the Civil Administration and interests of inhabitants on the following important projects : (1) Protection of river bank at Karradeh just below Baghdad which isseriously endangered by erosion.   Cost involved, 100,000Z. (2) Agricultural scheme for increasing food supplies of Army.   Costinvolved, 400,0001. (3) Damming of Majar and Chahala canals near Amara to increasedepth of water in narrows.   Cost involved, 7,000L (4) Continuance, or suspension of Hammar dredging operations andreconstruction of the Hakaika dam.In all four cases I had to form an opinion and furnish my views without any expert advice whatever. Schemes 1 and 3 were put up by Garrow under instructions of Inland Water Transport, so I obviously could not go to him for independent opinion, and in (group undecypherable) 2 he was not here. I merely report above to demonstrate that officer selected must be a man of adequate weight and standing./7-4
