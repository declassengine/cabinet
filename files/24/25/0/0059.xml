(THis Document is the Property ofHis Br itan hi c Majesty^ Government.)Circulated to The Kto- end Mar. Cabinet,1958 L       Mmorandum^----r^-Sr by Serbian Frame Minister.1.The remainder of the Sex-bian Army has, since the great Ketreat, been reconstructed and sent to the Salonica front.   Since that time there has &quot;been some hard fighting in which the Serbian contingent has had very heavy losses which could not be made up, as the Serbian Army has practically no more reserves.   There are in the front line many old men who are no longer able to fight, but can do the work behind the front.There are, besides, many Serbian Divisions which have not had even one day&apos;s rest since the formation of the Salonica front, but have always been in the fighting line.  Physical fatigue has begun its destructive work and there are already numerous cases of heart trouble amongst the soldiers, and foot troubles are very general amongst them.   Owing to much suffering-, cases of suicide and other signs of demoralisation are beginning to occur. In order to avoid fatal consequences of that superhuman and continual physical strain, some measures should be taken without delay.      :The first and most urgent measure is the shortening of the Serbian front, as it is the longest in proportion to the strength of the Serbian Army.   The Serbian Gov-, eminent therefore,request the Allied Governments to causeimmediate
immediate steps to be taken to that effect and they are strongly of opinion that the future Serbian front should be the present line of the Second Serbian Army.  The line held at present by the First Serbian Army should be taken over by Allied troops */;The Serbian Amy on the Salonica front is weak and exhausted;   In order to reinforce it, the Serbian Gov-ernment has requested:(a) the Russian Government to send to the Salonica front the Serbian Volunteer Corps, 20,000 men strong, which is at present at the Russian front in Roumania;(b) the Government of the United States to sendto the Salonica front an Army Corps composed of Southern Slavs living in the United States,, which would be under the flag and command of the United States;(c) the Italian Government to liberate Southern Slav prisoners of war who are anxious to join the Serbian Army,The Serbian Government request His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to support these requests; as the Serbian Army would thus be reinforced by 50,000 to 60,000 men.In order to achieve better accord and unanimity between the staffs of the different armies on the Salonica front, and especially between them and the General Headquarters of the Allied forces there, it would be very useful to have representatives of all the Armies attached to the General Headquarters of General Sarrail.   These should include a general of the BritishArmy
Army, one from the Italian Army, one from the French.Army one from the Bussian Army and one from the Serbian Army, and the Chief of the Staff so composed would he the General Commanding the.Allied Armies on the Salonicafront. . :     .        ...Information obtained would be more reliable and in time, plans of operations would he drawn up collectively and their execution better organised. ,;- - 4.    ....Information has reached the Serbian Government that the state of the Serbian prisoners of war and interned civilians in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria, Is desperate.   They die from hunger, disease and exhaustion.The Serbian Government request the Allied Govern-ments to take over the maintenance of the Serbian pri-soners and interned civilians and to help them as their own.. Otherwise they will be exterminated.The help which the Serbian Government will receive from the United States Government will be used for new invalids and for the families of soldiers who are fight-ing at the frontiThe credit of seven and a half million francs granted a year ago by the Allied Governments for clothing and food for Serbian prisoners of war has not yet been used, owing to differences of opinion between the members of the Commission to which its disbursement has been confided.
Austria-HUrigiry and Germany are trying to make the best of the present situation in Russia.   Their aim is to achieve some great military and moral success be-fore Russia recuperates, and &quot;before the United States are prepared to enter the war with their full force.   The longer the war lasts the worse it will be for Germany, and it is probable that, she will make another and most  . serious peace move, offering even territorial conces-sions in Austria-Hungary, Turkey and perhaps Bulgaria, as she cannot afford that her people at large:should begin to perceive what the real end of the war is going to be.In case the Allies are disposed to enter into negotiations; the Serbian Government request them to invite Serbia also to take part in negotiations^ as she is anxious to contribute towards the concord and solidar-ity of her interests with those of her powerful Allies, Her experience and knowledge of the Balkan problem may be of great use to the Allies in creating foundations for a lasting international peace.The Serbian Government are deeply convinced that the true Serbian interests will be only those which are brought into concord and bound up With the interests of her Allies, and on that account they lay special stress upon their being invited to collaborate in securing the conditions of a peaceful development of European nations..(Signed). Nik.P.Pashitch.14th August, 1917.
Minutes by. the.Foreign Office thereto.The Serbian demands fall into two main categories; (a)&apos; those which are dictated by the existing exhaustion of the Serbian Army at Salonica and the depletion of their reserves, and (b) those which are inspired by the &apos; safeguarding of present and future Serbian interests in so far as these are affected by the general conduct of the War in the Near East.In regard to (a) they demand:--: (1) : g^;^fert efilng of - tho^front&apos; - entrust ed.:,;t b tnew&apos;v Serbian forces in the Sa^r^nicaJ^sector. ; vWe were originally asked to reduce this front from 55 to 40 kilometres.   We are now asked to reduce it to the &quot;present line of the Second Serbian Army!r thus releasing the first Serbian Army.: We have only re cently asked the French Go vemment t o instruct General Sarrail to make a more equitable distri-bution of the Balkan front among the Alllsd Contingents, and we have added that any such redistribution must take account of the fact that the Serbian line must be reduced rather than extended,,In view of these renewed representations, it might now be desirable to consult the War Office as to urging the French Government to carry out the required redis-tribution in such a way as to release the first Serbian Army, or at any rate to apportion 15 kilometres of the Serbian line to some other of the Allies.
(2)   The despatch to Salonica of the Sei*bian, Volunteer contingent now in Russia,.This contingent is put by the Serbian Prime Minister at 20,000 strong.  The War Office have instructed General Barter to send 3,900 at once, and to make arrangements for 15,000 to be sent before navigation closes.   General Barter had actually arranged for 3,100 to be at Archangel by September 5th, but from telegrams which we have subse-quently received from Dr.Inglis of the Scottish Women&apos;s Unit, it appears that;these men have now been ordered to the Russo-Roumanian front.   Sir -Yf.Robertson is in communication with General Barter on the subject, but we have not yet been informed whether the latter has actual-ly been able to arrange for the departure of the first instalment of these Serbians or whether the-Russian command have in fact ordered the whole contingent to proceed at once to the Roumanian front.The C.I.G.S, might be asked to send a further     . telegram to General Barter enquiring how the matter now stands, and whether there is any prospect of the whole 18,900 men, for whom we hae ourselves estimated, being sent to Archangel before navigation closes,(3) The United States to send to Salonica an Army Corns of Yougo-Slavs resident in -America to 1 ight - under the United States flag..This question has been ra ised befor e but has met with difficulties owing: (1) to the United States Neutrality Laws; (2) tonnage objections; (3) the fact that, prior to the pact of Coi-fUv Yougo-Slavs in -America were not particularly anxious to fight for Serbia.
of these difficulties (1) and (3) Have now been removed, but there remains theal problem that most; Yougo-Slavs in America are natural-ised United States Citizens and as such will be incor-pointed in the United States Amy.Me might in the first instance ask Sir C.Spring Rice for an estimate of Yougo-Slavs of military age in the United States, and enquire his views as to whether the United States Government would assist in the forma-tion of such a contingent, and consent to the incorpora-tion therein of United States Citizens of Yougo-Slav origin.It appears useless to approach the Admiralty on the tonnage question until we have some approximate figures to go upon.(4)  Release of Yougo- Slay npr 1 s oner, s - - in It al ian hands.The Italian Government have already had this ques-tion before them but have shown no readiness to further the project.We might, however, instruct Sir R,Rodd to approach them officially in the matter and to urge that these men should&apos;be released for service in the Serbian forces.It is to be observed that the Serbian Government consider that by schemes 3 and 4 they would gain from 30,000 to 40,000 men.Apart
Apart from these specific proposals for the augmentation of Serbian man power the Serbian Government make certain other requests of a more general nature, referred to above under category (b).They require:-(1)   The constitution of a ,iolnt Military Council for the Salonica Army to be, attached to General Sarrall&apos; Headquarters.This question is necessarily connected with the attempts which have been made in the past to induce the French Government to remove General Sarrail from the Chief Command at Salonica,, Hitherto Monsieur Ribot has succeeded in evading our representations on the subject, but it might be possible to profit by this occasion to renew our endeavours.   If the French refuse again/ we might suggest, as a compromise, the appointment of an Allied Council of the nature proposed by the Serbians. The French Government could scarcely refuse such a sug-gestion if it were put to them by all the Allies, and the institution of such a Council would probably carry with it the automatic resignation of General Sarrail.(2) .That the Allied Governments should take over &quot;the maintenance of the Serbian Prisoners in enemy hands.Our own Treasury have never agreed to any advance of 7,500,000 francs and have only accepted a share of1,000.00b.        .    .     \It-appears that these prisoners number some 130,000 and that the arrangement which had been made to share between us and the French the responsibility for the pro- y^\:0\&apos;::-y&apos;:^r-:-\-: vision
provision of their food and clothing has not worked satisfactorily.   The Prisoners Department have endeav-oured without success to induce the French Government to accept some alternative scheme.The Serbian Government apparently wish that we should now take over the entire maintenance of these prisoners &quot;as if they were our own&quot;.   I presume that this would he impracticable if only from the fact that our own prisoners depend largely upon private assist-ance which would not be forthcoming in the case of the Serbians, but it might be possible for us to induce the Treasury to increase the subsidy now being paid to the Serbian Relief Fund, and to request the French Gov? srnment to assume increased responsibility for one half of the total of Serbian prisoners now in enemy countries.(5)   That Serbia.should be allowed to take part in any negotiations which may be instituted in the event of the enemy Powers, making a further offer of neace.: We might meet this demand by inducing our Allies to join in some formula such as the following&quot;?-&quot;The Allied Governments desire to assure the Serb-ian Government that in any negotiations which may be entered into with the enemy Powers they will not commit themselves to any decision regarding Serbian interests until the Serbian Government have been consulted and have been given an opportunity of expressing their views&quot;.
