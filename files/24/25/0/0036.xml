Jamiano Valley where clearing up trenches yielded another 150 prisoners today all of the 98th, 21st and 55th Regiments o&apos;f the 10th Division which has suffered much loss in the efforts to hold the Brestovizza sector.     28th Austrian Division has been withdrawn to reserve and 10th Division has extended its front to the sea.   There are now 28th, 35th and 12th Divisions reforming in Reserve and the 41st Honved Division still intact though interception today indicate that units of its 20th and 31st Regiments are being brought into the sector of the 9th Division north of Selo.   Possibly counter attack is contemplated to recover portion of the K, line captured by Italians the loss of which is much felt.Proportion of Machine guns with Austrian Infantry is being increased.   Instead of one company with 8 machine guns per Battalion, each company is being supplied with 4 machine guns.Organisation of Austrian Divisional Artillery is being changed.   With the Division now only the regiment of heavy artillery remains with 2 batteries of guns and 2 batter-ies of Howitzers all of 150 millimetres.    The Regiment of Field Artillery with 24 to 30 guns and one battery of trench mortars and the regiment of light howitzers with 24 to 30, 105 millimetre howitzers are now each to be attached to one of the brigades of the Division.    Brigades, however, exchange batteries of guns and howitzers as may be required temporarily. There is still no reliable information of arrival of enemy large units as reinforcements.   It is to be noted that the various divisions withdrawn to reform formerly completed this operation in 3 or 4 days.   Now however, 106th Division has come back into line with a borrowed regiment and very weak battalions having taken 10 days to reform.
