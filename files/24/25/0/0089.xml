jCfft- (This^Document Is the Propervy.,: 113rJtann&apos;ic Majesty&apos;s, Govern - .&quot;      .SECRET,Operations *From:- General Barter, Russia, To:-     C.I.G.S., War Office.6,9,17.11,10 p,m.1233,This morning C,-in-C. informed me that he is making dispositions for the defence of a second line running roughly from near Pernau to immediately south of (?) Pskov.   He is rapidly moving 2 Cavalry Corps to neighbourhood of Pernau.   He expects a landing by Germans at Pernau or at Raumo in Finland, more probably at former but possibly with a smaller landing at latter to stir Finnish population to revolt.   He says that 42nd Corps now occupying Finland is in bad state and that it cannot be relied on. He is afraid that fugitives from Riga of 12th Army, may have very demoralising effect on troops sent to hold Venden position,12th Army occupies Venden positions Peterskapel-Lake Ldze - Ligat.  (on railway) - Lake Lobe - Friedrikstad,This line is only temporary and line will run .&apos;. south *f Lake Lobe to bend in river east of Friedrikstad,6th Siberian Corps is fresh and considered re-liable.     Holds line up to River Aa. 2nd Siberian Corps badly shaken and unfit to fight.       Holds line to 10 versts sputh of railway.43rd is in the same condition as 2nd Siberian. Holds about 15 versts.     21st Corps still untried.     Holds remainder of line.In reserve 20 versts south of Venden, 2 untouched divisions almost untouched (sic) and. a brigade quite fresh.     Also 6 Cavalry Divisions,     Artillery losses still remain unknown.   Germans claim 150 guns.   Many more must have been lost.,    German drive to north between Rodenpois and. Hintsenberg was late and owing to marshes and forest artillery could not be used much.   Fugitives are returning, irresistibly drawn (?) by field kitchens.     It would be rash to hope this position will be held,     German main body not in touch at present.
