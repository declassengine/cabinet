SEC R E T.

September, 1917.S.62801/17.Sir,With reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to inform you that he ha3 communicated with the Secretary of State&apos; for War in regard to the proposed increase in the strength of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions.2.   Lord Derby states that it is impossible for the War Office to provide the additional men required,  the difficulty being, it is understood, due to the fact that the Army is at present being drained to the utmost extent possible to provide additional men for agriculture.3*   Sir Joseph Maclay agrees with, the port and Transit Committee in attaching the highest importance to the increase in the Battalions.   He is satisfied that unless the additional men are provided, it will not be possible to maintain the flow of essential traffic,  such as ore, .wheat and munitions, through the ports during the coming winter, with the result that the ports will become blocked and ships v/ill be detained .   As the War Cabinet , will appreciate, it is easier to prevent a state of con-gestion than to cure It when it has arisen, and if the choice has to be between satisfying the demands of agriculture and providing the additional men required for the Dockers&apos; Battalions, Sir Joseph Maclay Y/culd sub-mit that it is a matter for serious consideration whether the claims of the Battalions should not have priority.It can be shown statistically that the food equivalent of labour   applied to expediting the turn--round of ships is iim easurably greater than in the case of labour applied to agriculture..
a      T+ mint further &quot;be home in mind that the men DllAth, tJ^Se Transport Workers&apos; Battalions remain, part of fii0HoSe Defence Army and available for military purposes. The Port andtransit ISxeoutive Committee have alway^done their utmoat te arrange the civilian employment of the Battalions so as*t5 iSteJSS^aa little as possible with the maintenance of their military -efficiency and the Battalions are always at the immediate disposal of the War Office should occasion arise.I am to request that the matter may be brought before the War Cabinet for consideration at an early date in order that the necessary preparations may be made in good time for the coming winter,I am. 1 &amp;c*,: : (Signed)   JOHN AND3RS0N.IISecretary., War Cabinet to M-initetry of Shipping.14th August, 1917&apos;Sir,I have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of the 13th August, covering a Memorandum by the Port and Transit Executive Committee requesting authority for an increase in the strength of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions by 5,000 men above the present strength of 10,000.. Before I submit this matter to the War Cabinet, I should be glad if the question could be discussed by your Department in consultation with the War Office, who are primarily concerned in the matter.X am, &amp;c.,(Signed)     M..P.A.HANKEY.Secretary.IllvMinistry of Shipping to Secretary, War Cabinet.No. 62801 13th August, 1917.Sir,v. * ^ directed by the Shipping Controller to forwardherewith, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, a memorandum by the Port k Transit Executive Committee requesting authority  0LJ^n incr^ase in the strength of the Dockers Battalions by 5,000 men. -n__Sir.

BY THB^PORT AKP TRANSITTranspov bjforkera^ Battalions.. Memorandum showing t^j-e^es^^ in strength.,j. The demands&apos; for assistance from the Battalionssteadily increase.Since the formation of the first of the Battalions 944,000 days5 work have heen done, of which 149,000 were put in last month;2. Since the strength was fixed at 10,000 the Committeehas been instructed to provide assistance, not only in the Ports but also to :*** &apos;Steel Works . Railways Canals.:3. Out of the present strength of 10 ,330 there are now6j4-63 men of the Battalions employed as underPorts 5,175Steel Works 46oRaiIways 749Canals 716,463.4. Transport difficulties are always much greater inwinter than in summer as congestion is caused by fog, rain and snow, and the shorter days.5* The concentration of the ships in convoys leads torushes of work and therefore to congestion.6. To enable the ships to be used to the best advantageit is of the first importance that there should be available an adequate supply of mobile labour.To enable the Committee to meet the demands of the coming winter, and the additional duties imposed on them in regard to the Steel Works, Railways and Canals, it is necessary that the strength be increased by at least 5,000 men.This increase should be authorised as soon as possible as it takes time for the War Office to arrange the transfers and for the men to settle into the work.The Battalions will continue to be used only to supplement proved deficiencies in the available civilian labour.The cJoinmi&apos;fctee will continue to do all that lies intnStPtE2V,^.3^arrai,se the civilian work of the men sofrS-wSi   ^at-aliens may remain available at all times 1 or Home Beience.10th August, 1917.
