0 Df   JO,SECRETiIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BAW/015.Weekly Report on Au stria-Hungary *   XV. (8th September * 1917.)The Few Austrian Cabinet *     With considerable flourish of trumpets Dr. von Seidler has introduced to the world what is known as a &quot;definitive&quot; Cabinet, instead of the stop-gap Cabinet of acting officials of which he has been the head since the fall -of Clam-Martinic last June.     The new Cabinet does not however differ materially from the old, and forestalls obvious criticism by publicly announcing that it has been formed on non-party lines because none of the parties in Parliament were in favour of what is known in Austria as a &quot;Parliamentarised&quot; government.With one exception all the stop-gap officials retain office as effective Ministers: they are all admirable but colourless bureaucrats of whom there is nothing to be said.     The Cabinet now consists ot ten officials, five professors and one member of the high aristocracy, or to quote their own account ef themselves, &quot;cf officials and experts&quot;.     There is one interesting innovation the appointment for the first time in Austrian history of a Slovene and an Ukrainian as members of the government, and this has quite naturally been interpreted as a proof of goodwill te the Southern Slavs and Ukrainians and iS for that reason regarded with distrust by the Poles and Magyars.     In reality it commits neither side in any way.     The Slovene/Professor von Zolger, though a real authority on constitutional law and especially en the Dual System, is a pure bureaucrat of the a-national Austrian type, without party political ties of any kind, while the Ukrainian Professor Horbaczewski is a medical man of some distinction and
also entirely ncn-political.     3j entrusting the letter with the new Ministry of Hygiene, the Premier tones do\vn the national meaning of his appointment.     In short both Southern Slavs and Ukrainians are flattered at-an attention which represent a a new etage in the &quot;arrival ef nationalities hitherto utterly out ef favour, but make it clear that they retain an entirely free hand to act according to circumstances&quot;.     It is quite an illusion to suppose that 1fce Slav bloc has come to an end, though some of the Slavs are less intransigeant than others.     The Czechs maintain strong and open opposition, while the Southern Slavs, while strongly professing their solidarity, are read^ to co-operate with the government from time te time.     The Poles stand more aloof, and the Polish Club is passing through a crisis which may or may not end in complete dissolution.     But none of the Slavs have renounced their national claims, and there is a general tactical &quot;marking time&quot; until the next meeting of Parliament which is announced for the 18th September.Two other appointments are of importance.     The new Minister of Commerce is Baron Wieser, Professor at Vienna, one of Austriafs most prominent economists and one of the chiefs of the German Left in the Upper House.     As he has particularly, strong views en the question of the Germans of Bohemia and carries very great weight in many directions,his appointment is doubtless intended to reassure German opinion: and his past record makes it well-nigh impossible that he should accept any programme such as the Slavs would regard as satisfactory.     Curiously enough the official Fremdenblatt devotes a special leader to his appointment, and while paying him fitting compliments and quoting his war pamphlet r on the part played by industry in modern warfare, expresses polite surprise that a pure theorist should have been appointed to such a pest at such a time.     It is just possible;that this means die-: approval of Wieser on the part of Count Czernin, the Foreign
jciri i si erand VthaV Wie a er owe s the p o st t o in fluence; connected with Budapest and Berlin.     In that case the new Minister of . Agriculture, Count Silva-Tarouc i; might be regarded as a counter-foil to Wiescr.    :Silva-Tarouca is the leader of the Right (extreme Conservatives and landowners) in the Upper House, a prominent Clerical (once President of the Catholic Congress) and, like Czernin and others, an intimate of the late Archduke Francis Ferdinand and a support er. of his political ideas.     Ke is also a link with the more moderate Conservative Czechs.     He is probably intended to hold a watching brief for Count Czernin in the Austrian Cabinet and is likely to have great influence, especially behind the scenes and at the CourtThe nev/ Cabinet, though it emphasises its impartiality in national questions and its desire for &quot;intensive economic, social and financial work in close collaboration with the Reichsrat&quot; has had a cool reception from the press      Probably the Socialist Arbeiter Ze itung strikes the predominant note when it declares that the new Cabinet &quot;neither attracts nor,repels, but leaves people indifferent&quot;.     This is well-nigh inevitable in so bloodless an organism.     Thus nothing is likely to happen until-Parliament meets.     But a further adjournment is scarcely possible, since it is openly admitted that immediate arid urgent efforts must be made to restore order to the finances and to food questions. . .Economic Stress..-, Of this there are increasing signs, and! less and less attempt to conceal it in the press.:. The question of coal distribution for. the coming winter looms steadily larger: there, are lengthy Official statements on the subject from&apos;the Government and from the Mayor of Vienna, and open, references to the intolerable conditions of last winter and the need for preventing their     ^
recurrence.     There are incessant complaints about the &quot;PotatoQuestion&quot; and the lack of vegetables this summer even in Vienna.Among articles of every-day use which are giving out, are soapand leather.     The press prints humorous descriptions of the useof sandals for boots: and wooden clogs arc also common.     It ishowever to be presumed that in so agricultural a country enoughmilitaryleather is available for the most essential/pttsposes, though civilians may have to go without.The Clothes gamine.   Far more serious from a military point *f view is the shortage of cloth and the difficulty of replacing uniforms.     According to the Socialist Arbeiter Zeitung suits of clothes are prohibitive in price, etfen for quite well-placed officials: and we learn that even in fashionable Budapest restaurants it is common to see men of high position with their clothes turned.     There is talk of a new method of making cloth fr*m heather fibres: and it is announced that c-.-,rds for new suits (on the analogy of sugar and bread cards) are to be introduced. The Zeit quotes one of the leading Viennese shopmen as stating that stocks of clothing are virtually exhausted, and that cards are useless, unless the Government is able to provide new stocks.Three special details may be quoted as throwing light uoon economic conditions.     (l)     In reply to a highly optimistic account in the Heue ffreje Presse of conditions in the lemberg cafes, one of the responsible officials of that town draws a terrible picture of the &quot;general poverty and misery&quot;, states that over 130,000 of the inhabitants are drawing some support from the State, over 26.000 are fed daily in the public kitchens: that apart from 4,000 school children who have to be kept by the authorities, a free kitchen has had to be opened for 800 boys in secondary schools: that there have been no potatoes, rice or ffuit for months past, and for all but the rich no milk or fat, and that the weekly allowance per head is  kilo, black bread.     (2)   The Stathalter
of Bohemia has &quot;been the object of very violent attacks on all sides owing to the exportation of grain to Germany in spite of shortage in Bohemia: and very serious rioting is reported from Prague and other towns, apparently of a mixed economic and political nature.     (3)   The Hungarian Minister of the Interior has ordered all strangers, Germans and Austrians included, to quit Budapest, unless they can prove business reasons for their stay.      (Hitherto Budapest had been selected as a residence by wealthy ITorth Germans, who found themselves no longer welcome in Bavarian watering places and to whom Hungarian conditions represented real plenty).     The official Premdenblatt explains this measure by (a) &quot;unsatisfactory housing conditions&quot;, and (b) &quot;daily increasing difficulties of provisioning in the .capital11. .Economic stress is accentuating still further the racial dissensions, since it leads tc recriminations and charges of favouritism.     All Austria rages against the Magyars for keeping an undue share of food supplies, while the Czechs accuse the Germans of Austria of exporting Czech food to Germany, the Poles complain of the neglect of Galicia, and the Croats of Croatia make captial out of Austrian and Magyar neglect by voting out of their own scarcity supplies for their more hardly-hit kinsmen in Dalmatia and Istria.The full extent of the shortage of real necessities may be gathered from a leader in the Zeit of 26 August, which points out that &quot;there comes at last a moment at which cutting down and tightening one1s belt cannot be carried further, because the primitive needs of life have been reached and because these cannot be dispensed with.     But a man must eat and clothe himself&quot;.     It praises the idea of a &quot;Clothesjfe Card&quot;, but treats it as coming too late, owing to lack of material, and adds that not merely can new clothes not be bought, but old ones cannot be repaired, because there is not even darnigg wool or cotton left.     The publication
- 6 -of such an article is in itself a revelation.It is significant that the ffeue Freie Presse, (whose relations with the Viennese Boursej and also with Berlin firiance, are very close) has taken recently to emphasising the desperate financial situation.     In a recent leader entitled &quot;Missing Millions&quot;, it contracts the official figures showing expenditure for 1916 at 7231 and revenue at 3387 million crowns (i.e.  301,000,000 to  141,000,000, reckoned at the crown1s pre-war value, from which it has deteriorated by more than half).     It proceeds to argue that in the matter of taxation &quot;no one can be spared, and life will be harsh for all&quot; after the war - and other almost panic-stricken phrases about depreciation and the need for disarmament-A balance must be restored to the budget, in order to make it possible after the war to make good the losses and import r$w material.     There may perhaps be some connection between this attitude and the activity of the big Viennese financiers in Switzerland, to which Signor Bissolati!s organ, the Secolo of Milan, has recently given some prominence.The Government has taken a certain step towards publicity by giving out the figures of State expenditure, but no information is vouchsafed as to actual war expenditure, which is met by loans-New taxation has brought in  26,000,000 during the past year, and is drawn from increases cn income, house and ground rent taxes, beer, spirits , sugar, tobacco, matches etc..     The growth of the deficit is due mainly to interest charges on the debt, and allowances to soldiers&apos; families; it has increased during the past year by over  130,000,000.     Aa the Frankfurter Zeitung points out, the present figures &quot;are in no way a criterion for the future peace budget&quot;, especially as there have been fresh loans and additions to the allowances.     A large increase in taxation is recognised as absolutely inevitable, though resources are already strained to breaking-point.
Tall Tale8 about Ingland.     There lias been one very curious recent development in the Austrian Press.- namely, the circulation of insane and fantastic accounts of affairs in England, calculated to convince the Austrian public of our desperate straits.    The chief sinner has been the Neue Prele Presse, whose proprietor-editor Herr Benedict, like many of his staff, have a really intimate knowledge of England and are therefore obviously sinning against the light.    Per instance, on 11 August this paper deduced from an answer of the Secretary for Scotland to a question in Parliament, the existence in England of a Council of Workmen!s and Soldiers1 Delegates similar to that in Russia i     It also asserted that Mr. Lloyd George at Glasgow Mhad to arrive and depart secretly, in ordeasr to protect himself against hostile demonstrations and during his stay had to be eurrounded by a guardJ&quot;    On 23 August great prominence is given to the &quot;mass petition&quot; in favour of peace, handed to Mr. Lloyd. George in the name of &quot;a quarter of a million of members of various professions, and (what is specially important in view of recent events and Lloyd George^s political position) by 900,000 workmen&quot;.    The two signatories singled cut for special favour are Mr. Brailsford, author of one of the best books on Macedonia (&quot;Written at a time when English policy had not yet hwcL turned to RuSBia and when the conspiracy against Turkey had not yet been decided upon in Reval by King Edward and the Tsar&quot;) and Mr. Edward Carpenter.     It is treated as proof that the pacifists are growing stronger and are no longer to be intimidated by the &quot;War Press&quot;-     There are similar articles on the allegedtiiange of atmosphere in England, and a long leader on 30th August in the semi-official Pester Lloyd on the thesis that &quot;Russia and England are ruled by dictators&quot;.R.W.S.W.
