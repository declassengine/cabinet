ThiB, course has created an unfavour-able impression, and if they adhere to it they are unlikely to succeed in negotiating an agreement with the United States. But Denmark is in urgent need of petroleum, petrol and lubri eating oils, which at present can only be supplier! in ade-quate quantities by the American oil-companies.   In the past we have found that statistics could be obtained from the Danish Government, by the judicious application of economic pressure.     Ho doubt the American Government are aware of our experience, and realise that Denmark is presuming on their known reluctance to starve the neutral nations.ties,     !2heir delegates at Washington have supplied certain statistics;   and the Norwegian Minioter for foreign Affairs has informed the American Press that Norway does not dispute the right of the United States to demand guarantees against the re-export of any American goods supplied to Horway, or of the products of such goods.      Norway evidently counts up-on one of two contingencies - an early peace or a satisfac-tory arrangement with the United States;   for she has not taken the: trouble to ax*range any general system of rationing. There is a comfortable belief abroad in lorwcy that, if the United States insist upon the cessation of all exoorts to Germany. Germany is no longer in a position to retaliate by declaring war on Horway*      2he United States Exports Boero are firm in their decision that they will not for the presentTho llorwegien Government have followed different tae-
ail export of any considerable quantity of cerealsto Norway. It is estimated that 300,000 tons are required to carry the country over to the harvest of 1918: &quot;but this year/s harvest, is not yet consumed. -\;-.V;::&apos; The Swedish Government are endeavouring to drive a hard bargain ?/ith the United States.   They count upon the anxiety of the Allies to send supplies to Russia over the Swedish&apos; railways, and hope to get what Sweden requires from the United States in exchange for full transit facilities to Russia.      They argue that Sweden is bound by the commercial treaty of 1911   o continue supplying Germany with iron ore;ibut this is a plea which they would find it difficult to sub-stantiate;   nor are the United States likely to be impressedIIby the further argument that some of the   iron mines which11have entered into contracts with Germany are state-controlled. The food position&apos;in Sweden is likely to become such , In the course of the winter, that it will be Impossible for the Government to avoid making concessions to the United States. Russia is unfortunately tempted, at the present moment, to obtain the credits which she requires for her Swedish pur- . chases by licencing the export to Sweden of such essential coKMOclitles as mineral oil..    Fortunately Russia cannot supply cereals, ihieh are urgently needed in her own great towns;   and , if the figures produced at &quot;Washington by the Swedish delegates can be trusted, the Swedish Government only dispose of about 120,000 tons of bread-corn and flour. ... ,Sweden is f\irther; suffering from a severe shortage of coal. ^Ser consumption of coal has been reduced to 50$ of the normal;   it is unlikely that Germany can increase supplies and the Swedish reserves are not more than 760,000 tons, a quantity which can hardly cover the Increased demands of the winter season. *

We are therefore prepared to honour our outstending le tters of /assurance for Butch cargoes, and to give facilities on the -&apos;V. usual ;conditions: for- cargoes coming from South America,   But. the main control over those imports of which the Netherlands are most in need now lies with the United States,    he United Statss;Exports Board is issuing no licences for exnort to the Netherlands;   and we are pledged to folio v. the same &quot;course) except in so far as we are bound &quot;by special agreements to licence certain exports (such as margarine materials) in return for essential supplies or other considerations.SPAIN.     The negotiations for a new Anglo-Spanish agreement are pro-gressing favourably.     We are prepared to supply Spain with as much British coal as she will fetch in Spanish shi^s, if Snain will agree not to licence the export of Spanish coal without -our consent.     Spain on her side is prepared to remove the present restrictions on the export of iron ore, pyrites and other minerals and metals.But it would be a mist alee to suppose that Germany has ceased to influence the commercial classes or the economic policy of Spain.     Shore-are unmistakable signs that Spain- has &quot;been selected as one of the bases from which Germany is to be supplied with food and        materials immediately after    .; the conclusion of peace;   that German capitalists have laid.   their plans for exploiting Spanish industry, and mineral re-sources ;     anS that Gorman shipowners propose to obtain control&apos;:.-of-.the Dpanish import and export trade.   An economic alliance between Germany and Spain cannot well be despised: by an Spanish Sovernment,&apos;-vy:;..;: &apos; y^^&apos;y-^\&apos;-;&apos;::^&apos;: .-&quot;V.-:-&quot;j.-&apos;.-       .&quot;&quot;&quot;.-&quot;&apos;-&apos;:V&quot;-&quot;.&quot;:i^gZSRLAe.,- ,. Qn Aug. .8&apos;the representatives of the Allies intimate^ to the Federal Government that we could no longer tolerate the
Restrictions placed upon the exports of munitions to theAllied countries, unless similar exports to Germany were-,.  similarly restricted. \: ;&apos;-In consequence the Federal Government.

Thisto... action has compelled Germany/withdraw&apos; the stipulation that no German coal shall be used in making jmm.it ions for the Allies; though Germany still insists, that the Allies shall import into Switzerland the same quantity of coal and coke as heretofore.   There is something paradoxical in this in-   ; direct concordat with our enemies for the division of the Swiss output of munitions.   The incident suggests that the Germans attach exceptional importance to a regular supply of Swiss aluminium.We have intimated to the Swiss Government that the Allies will take no reprisals against the Swiss bank;?, which have arranged for the advance of 180,000,000 francs to Germany in compensation for coal. This is only reasonable, as Svdtzer-l&amp;nd oan obtain the coal which she requires from no other source and on no other terms. But the Allies will expect similar credit facilities to be extended to themselves, and on better terms than those accorded to Germany.UHITR.D BT ;tbb.     The United Stat 3 dislike the proposal that their exnorts should continue to be regulated from the United Kingdom either by the present system of letters of assurance or through a Blockade Council sitting in London. The,/ alsof urge us to exempt from examination at Halifax all vessels which have cleared from United States ports under due super-vision.     We on our side are anxious that the United States Government should avail themselves of our experience in re-gulating exports to European neutrals, and consider that
without continuous consultation and cooperation the blockade can never ba effectively maintained.   As to the system of -examination at Halifax, we:are prepared to do everything nee-sssary to minimise the period of &amp;etention. but viould prefer . to. maintain the system until the United States Customs have ! organised an efficient control over the cargoes of outgoing   . .ships. v.&apos;.--&apos;:^- -;. /Xv-7.7. -&apos;:&apos;&apos;-:-.V-: &apos;-.-.-&apos;&apos; V v^i     VWThe United States he,re failed hitherto to keen us suffi-. ciently informed -as to their exoorts of coal to European and South&quot;American destinations.     fe are pressing for weekly re-turns of the coal licences issued by the American authorities&quot; - iand of the quantities actually exported.   Though the United States export only six million tons of coal per annum, as against forty one million tons exported from the United King-dom, there is a danger that the coal control which we ha to laboriously established in the past three years may be seriously weakened unless the United States interchange in-formation with us and also adopt the wain principles of our coal-policy,j IIiSUBMARINE BuOQKhDE,     She following: is &amp; summary of the losses tomerchant shipping, clue to enemy activities, which were reportedin the period Aug.31 - Sept, 6th inclusive.
