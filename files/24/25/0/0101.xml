Pearson of their Mexican Eagle shares without an undue stretching of the intmtion of the Regulation, a Regulation could certainly be passed which would prevent their being sold, if the War Cabinet considers this policy desirable.The Committee therefore re coined that a Regulation should be issued which would prevent the sain of interests of this character tc foreigners, so long as. the Defence of the Realm Act is in force.them.selves free to dispose of their Mexican Oil interests
