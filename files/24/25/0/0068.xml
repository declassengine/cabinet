From:- Brigadier General Delme Radcllffc, Italyv To:-     G.IoG.S*, War Office6.9.17. 1.55 p.m*381. :Situation Noon to-day.2nd Army.   Operations for the completed possession of St. Gabrielo are proceeding successfully though slowlyj   there are nsw 2 Italian battalions cn the summit and the western and south-western part of the mountain is in possession of Italian troops, which are closely pressing St. Catorina.   Last night 600 prisoners were taken which with (group apparently omitted) captures show that 23 Austrian battalions have been now engaged on St. Gabriole.     On remainder of 2nd Army front there is nothing to report.3rd Army.     Austrians after heavy bombardment last night resumed their counter attack thic morning from Hermada on the front of 13th Army Corps, employing chiefly 41st and 35th divisions which are attacking with great vigour.As the Italian lines as yet give very little protection and; being right under Hermada are exposed to very heavy bombardment, it is probable that 13th Corps will be forced hack tc the positions occupied by it before this offensive. It has lost two or three hundred prisoners and taken a similar number,   In the Jamiano valley and on   the remainder of 3rd army front, Austrian counter-attacks have had no success.There are reports of considerable train movements in Austria   towards Julian front.
