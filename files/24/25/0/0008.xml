Bureau,&apos; * Department of Information.FFW/010T.-/E^ILY   REPORT   OH, FRlHCS.     X \ugust 31st, 1^17.The two important events since the.report of August 16th are the Pope&apos;a Note and the development of the mystery.of klmereydajs death and the whole Bonnet&apos;Rouge business intc an Affaire&apos; of. almost the first magnitude.     It does not seem at oil likely that the action of thePope will produce any great effect in Prance.-   He is in the difficult position that those who would in other matters he most in-clined to listen to him are in this matter, of all Frenchmen,the most certain to turn o deaf ear.     The Catholics and Conservatives will &quot;be the last Frenchmen to turn Pacifist end on these subjects they will pay much more attention to&apos; LI. Barrea thufc to Benedict XV. On the other hund the Socialists, who enjoy playing with Pacifist talk up to a certain point, have no desire at all to be led by. the Pope.     So between the two it seems that the best reception his nebularities.vobtain is one of empty phrases of rospect which make no attempt to conceal substantial disagreement and disregard.Here are a few comments.     The semi-Conservative Debats says brutallj     &quot;these cataplasms of rhetoric will neither heal the dlserse from which the world is suffering nor increase the authority of the doctors who so unctuously prescribe them&quot;    The Temps, otf similar politics, i3 equally contemptuous.     &quot;The Pope treats this war as a lawsuit.     For us it is a Crusade&quot;     It indignantly re-pudiates the suggestion, made by the clerical Echo de Paris, that France had better be again represented at the Vatican, and regards the language of TiOuis XIV in one of his quarrels with the Pope as a muoh more suitable reply:   &quot;Rome hrs far more need of me than I of her:   the ill temper of the Pope has never given me a moments anxiety.&quot;     The Echo de Paris itself rejects the Note with enual
decision though of course in much more respectful language.     Theopportunity of the Pope was- to claim the high position of themoral arbiter of the tfojrld:   but he has been content to exhibithimself as a mere political opportunist.     In that field Catholicsof to-day are no more bound to follow him than were Joan of Arcor St. Louis.     The Caillauxist Pays makes the intervention ofthe Pope the occasion for a profane retort to the nickname of&apos;bleating lambs&apos; commonly applied to the Pacifists.     It con-antemptuously pronounces the whole affair as/Austrian manoeuvre and says the time for the Pope to speak was when the Germans began outraging Balgium.     The next day it becomes more civil, and enjoys itstff at the expense of the angry Catholic Press.     But, in its view, the peace of the future must come from people whose eyes are fixed on the futurevnot on the past.     And, therefore, of course, it is more hopeful of Stockholm than of Rome.   More-over Stockholm will have the courage whieh the Pope has not had: it will openly denounce the crimes of Germany.     So the Socialist Humanity claims the Pope as an &quot;International&apos; and an adherent of the Society of Nations, but, though much more civil to him than most of the other papers, declares that the whole of his appeal is fatally injured by the blot of neutrality.     No one has the right to be neutral in the presence of crime.     Altogether so far as Prance is concerned the Pone does not appear to have done either his German friends or himself much good by his intervention. Even the Humanit/ recognises that only defeat will bring the Germans to accept the peace on which Prance insists.Meanwhile the Dope is almost forgotten in the excitaant about M. Aimereyda.     This personage (true name Yigo) seems likely to be much more important as a dead mnn than he ever was as a living one.     It will be remembered that early in July M. Ribot announced
in the Chamber the arrest of a journalist returning from Switzerland with a large cheque upon him.     This wcs one Duval, of the Bonnet Rouge, a Caillaux paper of the worst sort, which has had more articles cut out by the Censor than any other paper.     It is now altogether suppressed.    At the time when the matter was originally raised in the Chamber it was noticed that M. Malvy, the Minister of the Interior, to whose province such matters belong, refused to allude to the arrest, though Deputies who knew of it kept demanding that he should.   Bo left it to H* jtibot who spoke later.     So also when, after many weeks, the enquiries led to the errest of Almereyda the Editor of the BoChnot Rouge, and a prominent member of M* Caillaux&apos;s stillborn Ligue Republicaine, the arrest did not actually take place till after M* Malvy had left Paris for a holiday.     It was made public on August 8th* A week later Almereyda died in prison.     The medical report was one of natural death but further medical enquiries resulted in an official announcement th-t he had hanged himself in his cell with a bootlace. As he was already in a dying eondition and in the actual circumstances had little to look forward to in the weeks or months he might have lived, his suicide does not seem in itself improbable, though of course it exhibits a scandalous laxity in the prison administration which has aroused the angry oomments of the Press.    But Paris is a city of suspicions, and when it learnt, as it did after a few days,   that the charge against Duval had been altered from one of trading with the enemy to one, only cognizant by the military courts, of communicating intelligence to the enemy, it could not help asking itself what secreta might have been elicited from Almereyda and whether there was no one to whom his death was extremely convenient.    ^Thatever the truth is Mr. Grahame of the British Embassy declares that the universal belief in Paris is that the wretched creature was actually got out of some-one&apos; s way - And several papers frankly express their doubts as to his
suicide.     One M. Morel, a barrister, who bad appeared on behalf of some of the staff of the Bonnet Rouge, -oublicly asks, among other inconvenient questions, which of the present Ministers rcaid an allowance to Aimereyda?    Of course the anti-Pacifist papers make the most of the affair, while the Pays and the Humanite7 are com-paratively silent.     Its political interest lies just there:   will the revelations already made, as that the foreign cheque was actually handsel back to Duval and cashed by him, orove fatal to K. Malvy? Will further revelations, if there are any, iavolve a greater person and a more dangerous?    Will they save Prance from Caillaux?    That gentleman is said to have betaken himself to   Switzerland, whether for the benefit of his health, or for the advantage of being outside the French jurisdiction, or for the pleasures of the society of the many German diplomats,including Billow and Bethmann Hollweg, now in thal^bountry, is not stated.     M. Malv.y has returned to Paris to face the music and has even made a speech, which appears however, like so many French speeches, to have been extremely vague and to have given no explanation of how the famous cheque came to be given back to Luval.     It deals chiefly with the spotlessness of his honour and his consciousness of having done his duty.     Nevertheless it seems to have satisfied the Conseil General of the Department of the Lot, which unanimously re-elected him its President.But his conduct is imougned before a wider and more dangerous court.     Already the affair has necessitated the resignation of vrrious prison officials and of M. Leymarie, who was M. Malvy&apos;s chef de cabinet and also direetor of Criminal Investigation.     It is officially stated that he authorised the restitution of the cheque tt Duval without consulting the Minister.     It is obvious that the affair cannot be left where it is.     light will be demanded, not only on the death of Almereyda but on the whole scandalous story which shows Duval
getting passports for&quot;some fifteen visits to Switzerland,   visiting German bankers their, returning to Frr-nce unmolested, and employing his funds in such a way as &quot;to make the charge against him one of treason.     Some of the money is known to have gone to Almereyda, who seems to have surprised the world by his riches of late.     What did these gentry give for what they undoubtedly got?     That is the question the Court Martial must answer.Meanwhile most   people will agree with the D^bats that the nation has a right to expect something more than the dismissal of a sub-ordinate, which looks more like a mere sop thrown to the public that the first act in a real cleansing of the Augean Stable.     It takes occasion to attack the vihole administration of the Interior and re-calls the ^eeest pacifist agitation which was one of the causes of the recent wave of depression, now, the pa/oer declares, completely passed away, which that Ministry was extremely slow in repressing.     -There did the bank notes come from that were found in the pockets of persons en-gaged in fomenting disturbance?     1. scrndal of this magnitude would in England have caused the responsible Minister!s immediate resignation. And even before these events, the damaging attacks of M. Clemenceau in the Senate and elsewhere had made many -oeople tjiak that H. Halvy would disappear from the Cabinet during the recess.     That expectation has of course now become much more widespread cind may almost be said to be general.     But M. Malvy himself makes no sign and one would hardly suppose him to be the kind of man who will go before he is forced, Vfill M. Ribot forue him?     That is what ho will have to decide in the course of the next fortnight.     The best opinion aeems to bo that. K. Mr Ivy will have to go and that perhaps others will go with him:   in fact that there may bo a considerable re-shufflo of the Cabinet.     It is seid that II. ?.ibot would like to bring Iff. Klotz to the Ministry of
finance;   but the difficulty-about this is that he is President of the Budget -Committee of the Chamber, and&apos; that if he left that post an effort might be made to put II. Caillaux into it.     Tht Parliamentary situation is altogether obscure and difficult, owing to the new open opposition of the Socialists, and the increasing preoccupation of the Deputies with the views of their constituents which they find it-very hard to ascertain, especially as so many of the voters are now a away in the Army.     The whole position of the Ministry may conceivably be affected by the progress of the &apos;affaire&apos; which somebody was evidently interested in hushing up, rs it rppears to have only been the fact that itmbecome accidentally known to the Prime Minister himself th^t caused the arrest of Duval after his cheque had been re-turned to him.The fear of Caillaux is still felt, as is obvious by the diffi-culty just mentioned as to M. Klotz leaving the Budget Committee. But the Affaire1 can hardly do him any good and might produce reveJE-ations that ivould be fatal to him.     In any case it can hardly help him that his friend Almereyda, who before his arrest declared that the attacks upon himself were really directed against &quot; ..a former Prime Minister, the only man democratic enough to impose on the world guarantees against future wars&quot;, is new universally believed, and may soon be legally proved, to have been a traitor in German pay.     Even before this business occurred it was already said that Caillauxrs attempt to get back $0 public life had been e failure.     It appears that when he spoke in the Chamber it was&quot;to a half empty House, in spite of the efforts of his friends, who tried to whip him up an audience.     Oa the ?;hole the best opinion seems still to be that his return to power is out of the question unless the Allies suffer some great military or economic disaster.     At present French &apos;moral&apos; is reported by English observers to have immensity improved both in
army and people.It may be worth noting that the De^bats which has not always been too friendly to this country, has an enthusiastic article on K. Louis Cazamian&apos;s &quot;la Grande Bretagne et la Guerre&quot;:    &quot;we can never sufficiently admire the efforts of the English&quot; it says, and much more in the same strain.     And even the P^ys, still less Anglophil, flow declares that it regards with &quot;horrorT the very idea of any such $hing Or: the possibility of a misunderstanding -with England after the war.     These are small signs but good.31.8.17. J,CB.
