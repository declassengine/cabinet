Barclay. (Jassy). Sept. 2nd. 1917....V. r..v-; D... 2.12. p. m, September 2nd. 1917,R,. 9,30,a,in,, oeptenber 5th..l917, No. 520.    (D)In our sub-joined complete our identic telegram of August 31 st (my telegrcm No.. 512) which as Russian Minister joined in it had to be drafted tenderly; my French Colleague my Italian Colleague and I think it our duty to recommend our Governments most earnest-ly following measures: .They are in our opinion indispensable in order to avoid evacuation of Moldavia a veritable disaster for the Entente,, who would also have to hear moral responsibility for annihilation by famine of a country which is heroically performing its duty to-* wards its Allies,.(1).   Provisional Government should send without delay to the armies occupying Moldavia a military or civil Commissioner endowed with necessary powers and energy to re-establish discipline, restoration g  which is easier and more necessary on this part of Russian front than on any other part.   &quot; .It is easier because of salutary influence exercised on the Russian soldier by his Roumanian comrades and moreover because Russian command has not here, as is the case in Russia, to take into account any demoralizing local feeling public opinion here being indignant at the inertia of the Russian troops; it.is more necessary because it is in Moldavia thatthe
the Central Powers are making their greatesteffort. -(2)..   The Commissioner would have to put an end to the anarchy resulting from conflicting authority between the Central Coteittee of (?Odessa) and the Committee (?Jassy).   Latter owing to its proximity to the Russian (Group undecipherable) latterly Usurped the authority of the former whichrhad been regularly elected by delegates of different Russian (?Armies). Committee has now sent a delegation to Jassy which intends to turn out the local Committee and which is undoubtedly animated by most pernicious sentiments.(3). One of the principal sources of weakness in the Russian Army is the insufficiency or the mediocrity of the officers and it would be therefore necessary besides sending Serbian Tehee units (?please note) my telegram No- 512. (?to send, omitted) a certain number of good regular officers as distinct from reserve officers who could&apos; be taken from the parts of the front where no operations are in sight.(4), As the Provisional Government is powerless to execute its engagements in the matter of revictual-ling and transport the assistance rendered by Allies would have to be (?practically) a control which however (?carefully) (?veil)ed should be strict enough to be efficacious and to guarantee Roumania against the recurrence of the catastrophe of last winter..(5). Above desiderata apply in general whether Moldavia is evacuated or not.General
:.vGeneral Korniloff is very favourably disposed- . towards Roumania.who gave him asylum when he escaped as a. prisoner of war from Hungary..   Best means of obtaining adoption and execution of above desiderata might be by personal application to him,lvjy French and Italian Colleagues have asked me to join in the above telegram which I have consented to do though I should have preferred if possible before doing so to consult Military Attache who is however at the front.      French colleague through the French officers is in a special&apos;position to judge requirements of the situation and I have therefore not thought it right to withhold my concurrence.(?With) desideratum  No. 4 I am of course unreservedly in agreement and I am very glad that General de Candolles whose great tact should he invaluable is proceeding to Petrograd in a few days. Repeated to Petrograd,.
