Report for period from 1st September te 7th September 1917.PENSIONS.The number of pensions granted during the week toj i i&apos; , v. , Iofficers and men, and to widows, children and dependants (Table I) was 12,635 (the highest number yet recorded) against 10,864 last week: and 11,282 the week before.    Since the beginning of the jwar 609,300 pensions, including children&apos;a allowances, have been awarded.2. The number of fresh claims to pension of disabledsoldiers dealt with by tho Awards to Soldiers Branch during the week ending 5thSeptember was 5,300 as compared with 4,400 during the previous week, and 4,800 during the week before.Of the 5,500 cases 3,555 were disposed of by the;   -award of pension, permanent or temporary, and 1,713 by the grant of gratuities, and in 32 cases the claims were rejected.   Claims which had previously been rejected under former Warrants were admitted in 435 cases, -.21 of the men being granted gratuities and ; 14 pensions.     The total number of dlaime previously rejected which have baen dealt with up to data is 7,452 of which 1,041 have been met by the award of pension and. 6,411 by gratuities. 3. The work of awarding and authorising payment of Widowsand Dependants pensions in current caseg le completely up to data.1,996 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week againet 3,017 last week and 3,020 the week before. Thert remain 19,886 eases to be dealt with (Appendix!).   The 1,$96 cases this week include 342 dependants pensioned under the Old Warrant who have, benefitod  by the re-assessment to the:. ; average
-average extent of 4/3 a week/and 802 dependentparents whose cases had been settled by a gratuity under the Old Warrant but have now been placed en pension at an average rate of 7/3 a week.   The rest of the 1,998 reaelve no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dopcnd^ao.Sh^failing off in the number of eases disposed of during the week 1b due to the faefc that it is largely the more difficult cases of converting gratuities into pensions which now remain for re-assessment.The progress made with this work, generally, rendered it possible to make a more exact count of the number (originally stated at stxait 7,SCO) which on the 4th April, 1917*A.required re-assessment under the new Warrant.   The corrected number is 72,500 of which Just over 55,000 have been disposed of up to date.     There will be no difficulty in completing re-assessment of the balance of about 17,500 by the agreed date - 31st October - a large number are indeed already approaching completion.No widows or dependants cases have been dealt withthis week.4. The recent announcement in the Press of the pro-visionsof the new scheme of pensions for parents, referred to in paragraph 5 ef last week*s report, has already resulted in the receipt of some hundreds pf applications.     The arrangements for dealing with claSjas are well advanced, but the work will be one ef considerable magnitude as probably some 85,000 bona fide claims or re-assessments will have to be dealt with during the next six months.    As the awards under the scheme will generally take the shape of pensions renewable annually the.work will be very heavy and a considerable addition to the staff will be necessary*
5. 31,500 authorities for the payment of the  5 grantson notification of death in oases of death on or after 1stJuly, 1916, notified before 4th April, 1917, have been sentte the Issue Office.   About 7,500 have still to be sent.About 17,000 payments have been made by the Issue Office.6. In paragraph 5 of the report for the period 11thte 17th August last reference was made to the line likelyte be taken by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal.     Since then theTribunal has given judgment in 8 cages, 4 in favour of thewhichmen and 4 against.     Reports of the favourable decisions/are to be found in Appendix II hereto annexed.     In the first of these cases the Chairman, in delivering the judgment cf the Tribunal pein%*$ out that&apos; the Royal Warrants of June 11th 1$16 and March 29th, 1917, introduced important reforms in the pension system which made it possible to grant pensions to men whose claims had previously been refused.     In the administration, however, he feund certain difficulties   and ;: he has come to the conclusion : that the decision whether a man waa pensionable or not is made wholly a medical question. In support o&apos;   this he drew attention to the Forms upon which the verdict of the pension authorities wer of orrery jand are still based.   In these circumstances he was of opinion that the personal element should have more weight where a pension was likely to be refused and the Tribunal had consequently, decided to see and, if possible, to hear in person every appellant.     The Chairman stated that the Minister of Pensions bad made it clear from the first that he in no way desired to attend to oppose oases but that he only desired to assist the Tribunal to obtain any information which would throw light on the facts being enquired into.     The facts of the particular case were then gone into and it was held that theappellant1s. :It--
appellant^ unfitness was attributable to or aggravated by military service.    A similar decision- waa- arrived tit in the other three oases, ,7. In a circular dated l8t August, 1917, LocalCommittees were requested to furnish men who were proposing to lay their cases before the Pensions Appeal Tribunal with any help required in drawing up their appeals.     In the light of the experience gained from the examination of the first oases before the Appeals Tribunal the Ministry is now Issuing a further circular (No. 17) modifying the former procedure and suggesting that Intending appellants should first lay their cases before a specially selected sub-committee of the Lo6al Cemmittee, and laying down the course to be adopted in such circumstances.     This Circular forms Appendix III.r    - TREATMENT. &apos;8. The liabilities undertaken by the Joint InstitutionalCommittee with respect to the various institutions which have been approved for the treatment of disabled men are now estimated as follow^;-Neurasthenics.

Appendix IV gives the classification of thedisabilities for which offioers and men of both the Army and Navy have been discharged (A) during the month of August 1917 and (B) since the beginning of the War up to the 31st August, 1917.10. Appendix V gives the numbers of limbless menadmitted or awaiting admission to limb-fitting hospitals or otherwise dealt with up to the 31st August.   It shows a total of 20,608 as against last month&apos;i total of 19,259 and a waiting list of 8402 against last month*s figure of 7,799 -an increase of 603.     Up to the same date 7,416 artificial lege and 4,104 artificial arms had been supplied er were on order.11.

From its opening in June 1915 up to the 51st August 1917, Dover House has fitted 398 officers with artificial limbs.     On the latter date 141 were undergoing treatment&quot;or were being otherwise looked after, whilst 166 were on a waiting list.     705 officers&apos; cases were thus accounted for. 12. The number of pensioners with injured eyesight, asshown by Appendix V, is as follows:--  Army Warrant Officer, N.C0fs and Men 5121Seamen and Marines 796Army Officers 39Navy Officers _165972From the beginning of the War to the end of August 721 totally blind soldiers and sailors had been admitted to the Blinded Soldiers and Sailors Hostel, St. Dunstanfs, Regents Park, and Its annexes of whom 277 had passed through. Of this number 239 had been fully trained and had set up for themselves, and the remaining 38 owing to mental or physical disability had left without being set up.     31 men were admitted during August, but none discharged and at the end of the month there were 444 in residence.     110 in Hospital were to follow when fit to be discharged.   42 officers have passed through the Hostel of whom 10 have left, whilst there are 6 who will come into the Hostel on their discharge from Hospital, 13, A report on the possibilities of Farm Colonies forthe Treatment and Curative Training of Tubarsulesis patients has been submitted by Dr. Hartley, the special adviser of the ii inIstry in Tuberauloais cases, In conjunction with Dr. Chapman of the Local Government Board.   The view Is expressed that these Colonies may perhaps be used for training suitable cases notonly
only in agriculture but also in other manual labour of an appropriate character.     A more detailed report, however, is in course of preparation by Dr. Bardswell   at the instance of the King Edward VII Sanatorium Council and Dr. Chapman of tht Local Government Board add pending its resgipi   which it is hoped wi^l be ready in October, Dr. Hartley recommends that no aotior should he taken.    A copy of the report Mawnexed as Appendix VI.14. Schemes of Treatment have been submitted by theRawtenstall and London Local Conaaittees and steps are being taken to supplement the deficiency of competent masseurs in Auxiliary Hospitals. The Reports on the schemes are given in Appendix VII.15, Appendix VXII shows that 156 cases of disabled menwer4 admitted to treatment during the week ended 5th September of these 146 were treated in hospitals or other institutions, ^he total number of oases reported as under treatment at the Sftd of the week was 543.16. Appendix IX shows that sanction was given forspeo\*&quot;* treatment in 120 individual cases not covered by General Schemes.TRAINING.17. A Ciroular letter (Appendix X) is being sent tothe Minister&apos;s Representatives on Joint Committees supplying them with information in connection with schemes for training in their respective areas.18. The question of the reciprocal training of disabledmen has been discussed (Appendix XI) with Captain Martin of the Oversees Military Foroea for Canada.    No definite conclusions wer* reached (except that in no case would the Minister be asked to be responsible for treatment) and the matter is to be considered further.IS.
X9, Last week1a report (paragraph 26) referred tothe training of men interned in Switzerland.   Major Mitchellis new making arrangements for sending materials to SffiUertjuaAas well as an instructor who will undertake the trainingof interned men.    The estimated eest of training theseinterned men *  2,600 per annum - has fceen voted by theRed Cross Society and the Committee have pasted * resolutienthat Lord Sandwioh and Major Mitchell should teal entirelywith the work.20* A Trade Advisory Committee on Building sat duringthe week and considered the reports of the sub^odiafflitteei on Painting and Plumbing, the letter teeing referred fceek. The Committee en Meehmie&amp;i Dentistry have agreed, subject to certain safeguarda, to assist in the training of disabled men as dental meeh&amp;nicas   and at Wals&amp;ll a scheme was approved for the manufacture of leather goods. :;The reports are contained in Appendix XXI.81. - - -    : Kajis&amp;ge -  .V eenf erenee has been held this week between the Ministry of Pensions and General Kussell on the subject of the supply of masseurs and the qualifications required.    A report of this cenferer.ee 1$ given in Appendix XXIX.   Further enquiries on the subject are being made.   It appears to fee probable that there will be a consider-able opening for the employment of properly training men both . Immediately   and aft-r the war, and that the work will be suited to certain Glasses of disabled sailors and soldiers, gfc. The difficulties experienced by the Swindon LocalCommittee in connection with &quot;Trade Unions were notified in paragraph 16 of the Report for the week ending 3rd August, the final agreement, embodied in six resolutions and accepted by the Local Federation of Trade Unions, is set out in Appendix XIV.     These resolutions differ but slightly from those given in the above mentioned report.
23. Technical.-Schoela-lji^lrmlngh^Instruction f&amp;r disabled men were disoussed at an interview between the Ministry and representatives of the Eiraingham Lecai Committee.     As the 3 existing teehnieal schools have been already practically taken ever by the Ministry of Munitions the Local Education Authorities have acquired the lease of premises for the purpose of providing suitable instructions and training to disabled sen.    k memorandum of the interview, at which details were considered, is annexed as Appendix XV,24. Basket making at Lancaster. k report en the workbeing done in this industry has been       ived from Messrs. Craven and Simpson, representatives of the Employers and Workpeople1s Associations respectively, who recently Inspected the workshop   in which a few disabled men are being trained. As it appears that the instruction given is not satisfactory and that the prospeoteof permanent employment at a remunera-tlve wage are not sufficiently good, the Lancaster Local Committee have been requested to consult the Joint Committee for their area with a view to the provision of a more suitable scheme of training.25. Diamond suttlng as an Industry for disabled men hasbeen referred to several times in former reports*   Appendix XVI contains an interesting aeeount bf Major Mitchell of his visit to Brighton in connection with this induetry*   The De Beera Company and the Diamond Syndicate approve the schema and the former are shoeing their praetieal interest by giving  2,600 towards the expenses of the training course. 26. General schemes^.     Cardiff Local Committee hassubmitted a scheme for cinematograph training which seems promising!   Th** Aberdeen scheme for training in Agricultureand
and Forestry has. been, eaimtioiiffid j   whilst Lelnster and , Connaught have put forward a schema ft*r amalX-lnsiuatrles which, subject to certain conditions, may prove servioe-able for men who can undertake only light work.     Appendix XVII shows the schemes in detail.27. Appendix XVIII shows that 33 men were admittedto training by Local Committees or otherwise during the week ending September 5th and that the total number report-ed as under training at the end of the week is 161.   It Is probable that these figures will not be complete   for several months, since they do not include oases in which training had been commence before Instructions of the Ministry were issued.28. &apos; Appendix XIX shows that in 40 individual oasesnot covered by general schemes sanction was given during the week to the training of disabled men. 29. Decisions as to Training(i) The Minister has decided that if a man has undergone a eourse of training which has not been arranged by a Local Committee, such Committee may give retrospective sanction to. such eourse, if they think fit to do ao, and. thereupon the bonus of 5/- per weak will be payable in raapeot of the parlod of training.(ii) The Minister has decided that if a man has abandoned a course of training arranged for him and the Local ComMttee are satisfied that he has had good reason for so doing, the Local Committee may arrange another courr of training for him.Organisation-

Tho Chairman pointed out that it would be necessary for the committee to form itself into sections each of which would deal with certain classes of questions sowing before tht committee. 7 Sections were then formed and various arrangements wore made with regard to procedure.    The minutes are attached as Appendix XXXI.&apos;       STAFF.33. Table II shows an addition of 249 to the staff ofthe Ministry, 87 having been added to the Administration, 113 being placed at the disposal of the Special Grants Committee, 29 being allocated to Treatment and Training and 25 to Alternative pensions.     In the Awards to $$Idlers, Awards to Widows, *:c., and in the Pension   Issue Office there were small decreases.     The changes in the Table and the large additions to the staff are due to the transfer to the Ministry of the functions of the Statutory Committee, whose staff has been take-, over by the Ministry under Section 3 of the Naval and Military War Pensions &amp;o. (Transfer of Powers) Act, 1917.      The deily percentage of absences during the week was 2*9 among the male and 4*7 among the female staff. 34. During the month of August in which the staffinereased from 3,667 to 4,003 or by 340,   9 men and 149 women resigned, 2 men were transferred and 3 women were dismissed. There Is reason to believe that a number of the resignations were frora members of the temporary staff accustomed to more than the fortnight1s leave allowed by the regulations.   Nearly one quarter of the resignations were -during the first month of servise and about three-fifths were due to domestic affairs or lllhealth.

-^pensions appeal tribunal.Case No. 2. -    -. -In the matter of Arthur Christopher Leslie, No.33828/H. Decision of the Tribunal delivered on Tuesday, August 21st, 1917.As this is the first decision of Tribunal, we have considered it advisable .in the public interests to set down shortly the origin, duties and powers of, the.Tribunal as we understand them..The pensions we have to&quot;deal with are not matters of legal right, but of favour. From pre-Crimean days they have been based on Eoyal Warrants, and until March, 30th, 1917, were granted in accordance with a Royal Warrant, the substance of which dated back to 1834. .&apos; Alterations were made in it from time to time, but even under the words of. the Warrant of May 20th, 1915, no.pensions were granted to unfit men whose unfitness was attributable or aggravated by service conditions..       &apos;   ....The words &quot; attributable &quot;,and aggravated &quot;. are not in.this Warrant.. Pensions were only granted by the words of the War-rant to men unfit for further service on account of wounds, injuries, or blindness caused by Military Service, or disease due directly- or wholly to War Service.. The phrase &quot;due directly-or wholly &quot; was in practice interpreted to include attributable cases. ;- A Koyal Warrant of January 11th, 1916, introduced the word aggravated, and this was followed by Order in Council of March 30th, 1917. (Navy), and the Eoyal Warrant of March 29th, 1917 (Army), and these documents introduced many reforms. - The present Warrants of 1917,.which we have to interpret, decree that a Soldier, Seaman or Marine &quot; discharged as medically unfit for further service such unfitness being certified as either attributable to or aggravated by naval or military service in consequence of the present war, and not being due to the serious negligence or miscon-duct of the discharged man,&quot; may receive a pension to be assessed according to the terms of the Warrant. /; These reforms have, of course, made -many men pensionable who have been discharged without pensions, and will&apos; in future make new classes of discharged men pensionable. The procedure needed to work this reform will probably require reconsideration.The old system of pensions was administered by the Eoyal Patriotic Fund Corporation, and in November, 1915, the Naval and Military War Pensions Act, .&apos;5 &amp; 6 Geo. V., Ch. 83, was passed establishing the Statutory Committee of the Eoyal Patriotic Fund Corporation with Statutory Local Committees and Sub-District Committees. In December, 1916, the Ministry of Pensions Act, 6 &amp; 7 Geo. V., Ch..65, was passed, and by Section 3 of that Act the powers and duties of the Statutory Committee of.the Naval and Military Pensions Act, 1915, were transferred to the Minister of Pensions. On February 15th, 1917, the Minister of Pensions took over the control of the Eoyal Hospital, Chelsea, and with it the machinery of the Medical Boards who decide whether a man is pensionable.0*5350)   Cpfs.   ii/17.   M. &amp;. S.
U -;:-. It is&apos;important to : remember these -dates. : The J^lpiistry of&quot;Pensions&apos; only came into.existence in. December, 1916, it did-not take over Chelsea until February5 1917, and it brought out the new Royal&apos; Warrants at the end of March, 1917.: Under these War-.rants the Minister of Pensions;.was appointed sole administrator and-interpreter,-but it is. obvious that no one human, being could decide the mass of matters: that:must, of necessity-come before-a[ Ministry of Pensions, and for the time -being,&apos; to&apos; reduce.:the.-!delay, in granting pensions as much as possible/it was a.business.necessity for the- Minister to accept the existing system of deciding who was,or was not. entitled to a pension. This system may-Have worked well &quot;in&quot;carrying out the limited provisions of the old Warrants, but in relation to the more complicated matters to be dealt with under the&apos; new. Warrants especially the decision of facts relating to cases of unfitness being attributable to or aggravated by service-it may turn out that in attempting to decide them by former methods we are trying to put new wine into old bottles.The old system of deciding whether a man is pensionable does not seem to contain any element of judicial enquiry into facts. It is indeed a wholly medical enquiry. As far as the man is con-cerned, the decision upon his claim to a pension is&apos; really&apos; con-eluded by the Medical Board. His ease or claim to a&apos; pension is not really heard at all. It is determined without hearing. This was no doubt &quot;not wholly inconvenient when pensions; were only given for distinct classes of injuries. Now, however, when ques-tions of attributability and aggravation arise, it does not seem to us in accordance with the principles of English justice that tho right of a man to a pension should be determined against him until he has had an opportunity of being heard in support of his case-by those who are going&apos;to determine it. This, no doubt, was in the mind of the Minister of Pensions when&apos;he set up this Tribunal to give.a hearing to anyone who claimed that his unfit-ness was attributable to or aggravated by service. .. .To understand how the position has come about it is necessary to follow, the history of Army Form B. 179, which contains the report of the Medical Officer proposing to invalid the man out of the Army and the opinion of the Medical Board on his case. As this Form,, with the&quot; man&apos;s Medical History&apos;Sheet A.F.B..178, constitute the sole foundation for the Minister of Pensions&apos; decision, the former is worthy of the most careful study.This Form B. 179 in its origin1 is an Army Form.used for&apos;the purpose of invaliding a man out of the&apos; Army. It dates back to 1895, and although it has been adapted from time to time and adopted for pension purposes, the procedure contained in it was not invented for the purpose of deciding pension cases. It does not contain material upon which this Tribunal would take the responsi-sibility of deciding under the new Warrants the fact that a man&apos;s unfitness is or is not attributable to or aggravated by service. /.&apos; Army Form B. 179 is a &quot; a Medical Report on an Invalid,&quot; containing two parts : 1. A statement of the medical case by tho&apos;Officer in charge of it, countersigned&apos; by&apos; the. Officer - in charge&quot; of the -.    &apos;-&apos;.&apos;.&apos; hospital; .
2. Opinion of the Medical Board before whom the^ invalid V&apos;&quot;     /-appears, who have.power to recommend his discharge &apos;    and to state whether further medical treatment is &quot; -:   desirable: .The first point in which this Form seems to us inadequate for the purposes of the Ministry of Pensions acting under the new Warrants is that nowhere is there any direction: to.the Medical Officer in charge, or the Medical Board, to make any enquiry from the man himself, or to set down his statement of how his. unntness came about: It is a striking fact that&apos; the word &quot;unfitness,&quot; which is the word in the Boyal Warrant; does not occur in Army Form B. 179. &apos;        V&quot;&apos;.   \ &apos;;- The only possible statement of the man&apos;s own view of his case that can reach the Minister of Pensions is contained in Para-graph 11, which orders the Medical Officer to &quot; ifirive concisely the essential facts of the disability, noting entries on the Medical History Sheet bearing on the case.&quot; The Medical Officer does not appear, in practice to set down the man&apos;s own statements in this paragraph, but translates them concisely into his own langu-age, which indeed is what he is asked to do. Further, there is this directory note to the Medical Officer:&apos; &quot; The answers to the following questions are to be filled in by :the Officer in medical charge of the case.&quot; In answering them he will carefully dis-criminate between the man&apos;s unsupported statements and evidence recorded in his military and medical documents. The wording of this note seems unfortunate, as it is often possible that a man&apos;s un-supported statement may be correct in fact, whilst the evidence recorded in a military medical document may be inaccurate. For the purpose of granting or refusing a pension the&apos;man&apos;s statement, whether supported or not, is essential to the enquiry to be under-taken, and its omission from Army Form B. 179 renders tlie work of the Awarders of the Ministry of Pensions a very difficult one.When we come to the second portion of Army Form B. 179, &apos; the&apos;Medical Board is asked in Paragraphs-21 and 22 to state whether:        - .- &apos;(1) The disability is clearly attributable to, or(2) Has the disability been aggravated by certain specified conditions. The use of the word &quot; disability &quot; and the omission of the word &quot; unfitness &quot; seem undesirable, inasmuch as the word &quot; disablement &quot; has always in pension docu-ments connoted specific injury.- The word &quot; clearly &quot; qualifying &quot; attributable &quot; has not the authority of the Eoyal Warrant!&apos;&quot;.:&apos;/:. Two directory notes to the Medical - Board should be referred to:- -        -   -  V      &quot;   :      &apos; &quot; -&apos; -    - ; -&quot;&apos; 1. Clear and decisive answers to&apos; the following questions. - - -. are to be carefully filled in by the Board as, in the event- of the- man being invalided, it is essential that the Minister of Pensions should be in possession of the- -  most reliable information to enable him to decide upon the man&apos;s claim to pension.&quot; &apos; -- &quot; 4: In answering question 21 the Board&apos;should be careful- to discriminate between disease resulting from military conditions and disease to which the soldier would have been equally liable in civil life.&quot;
From the point of view of arriving at the truth of an allegation that unfitness is attributable&apos;to or aggravated by certain conditions, we do not think that the filling up of answers to printed questions is the best method of obtaining reliable information. Note 4 seems: liable to mislead a.Medical Board, as the question of fact to be decided is not whether the disease from which a man is suffering is of a certain character, but whether his present unfitness is attri-butable to or aggravated by his military service, and this is alto-gether another matter.,We have set out these views oh.Army Form B. 179 at some length because we want to make it clear that the A warders of the Ministry of Pensions, the Advisory Board, and the Director-General - of Army Medical Service have been limited to the information it contains. This Tribunal decided to give applicants a re-hearing of their cases as is done on appeals to Quarter Sessions. The result has naturally been that we have had far. more evidence before us on which to base our decisions. It may be worthy of further consideration whether, in so far as a Form is necessary in these cases, one could not be drafted more in. the spirit of the new Warrants and the present liberal methods and practice of the Ministry of Pensions in carrying them out.It must be remembered in reading this decision that the Minister of Pensions has set up this Tribunal to deal solely with the questions of fact, whether or no a man&apos;s unfitness is attributable to or aggravated by service. We have no other powers whatsoever, and do not deal with questions of amounts or other matters under the Warrants.What we are saying, therefore, is only relevant to a portion of the enormous work of the Ministry, and deals in a great measure with past practices. Already 14.000 gratuities have been given, and these include over 5,000 old cases previously rejected. More-over, the Ministry interpretation of new cases is far more liberal than it was, and already they have made use of the new Warrant to place 1,000 cases previously held to be non-attributable into the attributable class, and these cases have thereby received pensions. The Ministry has to deal with 4.000 to 5,000 new eases every week, and it is scarcely possible that each applicant should be seen per-sonally. Nor, indeed, is this necessary. To grant a pension to a man under the Warrant there may be no need to see him. But before a man is refused a pension, which he may or may not be entitled to, it becomes important to consider what is the best method of enquiring into the facts of his case.It was to rectify mistakes already made, and probably to ex-periment in new methods, that the Minister of Pensions created this Tribunal. Every assistance has been given to the Tribunal by the Ministry to obtain at the earliest moment specimens of cases dealt with under the old system so that we might begin to hear appeals at once. There seems no doubt that a Tribunal is neees-sary to assist the Ministry in difficult and doubtful cases.The Tribunal held their first meeting on July 14th. 1917. and were occupied for some days considering questions of procedure. We decided that whenever it was possible an applicant should be heard.in person.   A Form of Notice of Appeal was drawn up and
circulated to&apos;the Local Pensions Committees,: and it has been arr^iged. that, when these. Forms, are. returned to the Ministry of Pensions the cases shall be considered anew and, if not found pensionable by the Minister, shall come to the Tribunal for hearing. When a case., is sent to. the Tribunal, the applicant - will receive a Notice of Hearing with a few simple instructions as to what he. is to do. The Tribunal decided to sit.in open.court unless, in any special case, it is. considered undesirable. The Minister of Pensions has stated that our decision is to be final..The Minister of Pensions from the first made, it clear that he in no way desired .to attend to oppose cases.; on the contrary, the part he wished to take in the proceedings was to assist us to obtain any information that would throw light on the facts we are enquiring into. The procedure we have adopted is.an endeavour on our part to carry out.the intention that the proceedings before us should have neither the form nor spirit of litigation.&apos;..It is clear that there must.be. some form of enquiry before a pension is granted, otherwise a, malingerer or dishonest person might receive a pension. What Parliament seems to have desired when it assented to the use of the words &quot; attributable to or aggra-. rated by&quot; was&apos; to insure that wherever a man, able under the conditions of civil life to work.and earn his own living,.was taken into the Army, and the result was to cause or, bring.out or add to) the burden of some illness or disease, not due to his own miscon-duet, so that when the man was returned to ciyil life he,was a broken man or disabled or partially disabled by reason of unfitness to carry on his former civil work, then the. Minister of:Pensions should grant such man a pension permanent or temporary, and of such amount as the Minister should think, just within the terms of the Warrant. -    .    . . ;..On these principles we have dealt with the cases that have come before us.The facts in LeshVs case are as follows: He had served for nineteen years in the Army, from which he was discharged-at his own request in 1907. His character was &quot; very good,&quot; and he was stated to be &quot; steady, reliable, willing, sober; recommended as caretaker or groundman.&quot;For two years after leaving the service he. was a market gardener at Newport, Isle of Wight, and in February, 1909, was appointed caretaker there of the Recreation Ground in the service of the Corporation, remaining in this post until he attested on March 1st, 1915. He was passed fit for service, and his Medical History Sheet records no defects on enlistment. He served for one year and six weeks, and was discharged on April 14th, 1916. Army Form B. 179, which has been the only statement of the case before the Pension Authorities, states that he was disabled, by Tiheumatoid Arthritis and Debility.The Medical Officer in charge answers the questions as to date and origin of disability: &quot; 1913, Newport, in civil life.&quot;Under Paragraph 11 the Medical Officer sets out the man&apos;s statement thus: &quot; He states :-His hips, knees, and shoulders especially the left-have been affected for several years, crippling him in the
cold months and prevent him. working, which, consists chiefly of gardening. Within the last twelve months, whilst in the service, he has been compelled to. have his. teeth extracted, and suffers from dyspepsia, headaches and much feeling of-weakness.&quot;Upon this the Medical Officer stated that the &quot; causation of the disability &quot; was &quot; not in any degree attributable to military ser-vice.&quot;   This view being upheld, Leslie appeals to the Tribunal.This case illustrates the danger of deciding a4case upon written hearsay instead of an examination viva voce. of the, man himself by some person used to taking evidence. As Blackstone says: &quot; The open examination of witnesses viva voce in the., presence of all mankind is much more conclusive.to the clearing up of truth than the private and secret examinations taken-down in writing before an Officer or his clerk. An artful or careless scribe may make a witness speak what he never meant by dressing up his deposition in his own form and language, but he is. here (in -open court) at liberty to correct and explain his meaning if misunder-stood, which he can never do after a written deposition is once taken.&quot; .       :The Medical Officer in charge is not to be blamed since Army Form B. 179 does not direct him to take an accurate statement from the man of the facts of his case. A further report, which was made on.March 27th, 1917, on Form A. 36/C, is much to the same effect.Leslie gave evidence before the Tribunal. On his medical examination he was in hospital, his teeth had been removed, and he was ill and had difficulty in speaking. He denied that he told the: Medical Officer that he was crippled in 1913. The evidence seems to. show that he Avas not. His story is that he had no rheumatism to sleeping on wet bedding at Cliff End Battery and suffering from rheumatism for eight months. He attributes his rheumatism t osleeping on wet bedding at Cliff End Battery and doing night duty on the guns in wet clothing. He was two nights on and one off on this duty for eight months. The Medical members tell us that the correct term for his disease is osteo-arthritis.As to his condition before attesting, he states that he is an Oddfellow of the Newport Branch, but that he has never drawn a penny from them&apos; in sick pay because before enlistment he has . not been ill. .He produces a very strong certificate from Dr. C. J. Thompson of Newport, who states that Leslie is on his panel list, that he has attended members of his family, known him as caretaker of the Victoria Becreation Ground since 1910,, and that he has never to his knowledge had any illness.He also produces a certificate from Dr. Thompson that he has been under his care suffering from some myalgia during. 1916 and 1917, and a letter from Mr. Bugg, Chairman of the Becreation Committee of the Newport Corporation, stating that &quot;he has not through illness been absent from his duties a single day, and.to the best of my knowledge he has always been a strong and healthy man up to the time of his re-joining the Army.&quot; .        - . .This statement is repeated and confirmed in another letter from Mr. Whitcher, the Mayor of the Borough of Newport.        : .;
v He was discharged permanently unlit for&quot;.all;&quot;services&apos;,-&quot;and-is stillAiisabled by unfitness. The- Tribunal unanimously decide&apos;that such unfitness- is- attributable;- to or aggravated by-military service in consequence of the present war - -Case No. 4. !     &apos;        ...    - -U       MlIn the matter of Arthur George Newberry, No.-&apos; 19626/H.De-cision of the Tribunal delivered on Tuesday, August&apos;21st, 1917.. &apos;Newberry signed : the obligation card; on the outbreak &quot;of the. war, attested on October 2nd,  19i4,  and - was discharged on June 30th, 1916, after one year and&apos;nine months&apos; service. ;He was a manufacturing agent in the City and travelled for himself.   Many years ago, while playing football in rubber shoes, he caught his toe in the ground, causing dislocation of one of the-bones of the metatarsal joint of the right: foot. He used to wear, a special boot and suffered no trouble or inconvenience in walking.After two&apos; or three months in the Army he- had a fall in the dark when on duty. He went before the doctor,-who examined his foot and he asked for special boots, but did not obtain them. He,&apos; however, bought a pair of special boots&apos;himself, and carried out his army-duties successfully for some nine months. -After that he had to -wear Army boots,: and he says that&apos; they have crippled- him; - Although- he&apos; now -has boots vmade specially,; he is not yet able to walk: as he did &quot;formerly and do his travelling.On May 6th,-1916, the Invaliding Board held that his disability was aggravated by military service, but the Director-General of Army Medical Service, to whom the. case was submitted, decided on October 5th, 1916, that it was not aggravated and-assessed incapacity as &quot;nil.&quot; A gratuity of  30 was awarded. Newberry appeals. . -   --The-Medical Members of the Tribunal examined&apos;^Newberry, and say that his condition is. consistent with his story/. He has pescarus, and is-now probably suffering from a metatarsalgia, from which he may in time recover. Before the man entered the&apos; Army he had been perfectly fit for many years. For months, as long as he could have special boots, he was capable of doing work in the Army. When he was not allowed special boots and given Army boots these produced his present condition of unfitness.The Tribunal unanimously decide that he is still: disabled by unfitness. and that such unfitness is attributable to or aggravated by military service in consequence of the present&apos;war.Case No. 7.In the matter&apos;of Arthur William Daniels, No.&apos; 42833/H. &apos; De-cision of the Tribunal delivered on Tuesday, August 21st; 1917. .; The Tribunal understands that this case was not pensionable under the old Warrant, and therefore&apos; the entries on the Medical Report could not be expected to contain material&apos;for&apos;a decision. Supplemented, however; by the man&apos;s evidence-the case seems
clear. Daniels &quot;was in-&quot;the Army for 145 clays.- He was a fijgja of over forty-two. and had formerly worked at an iron foundry. He was employed in. a-Labour Company of the A.S.C., and worked out of doors at Eouen shifting timber at the dock side and stacking it. He was under canvas until two days before Christmas, 1915, and then in huts. He worked from light to dark, wet or fine. ; Oil-skins were handed out at the end of January; but, he says, that no one;got an. oilskin.of his own, that they were&apos;not allowed to take them back to the huts, and when the work Was finished they were stacked - in the yard and became Wet inside. : On February 8th, -1916, he was taken ill and went into hospital, where he remained until April 14th, 1916, after which he was in a rest camp until his discharge on July 2nd, 1916, as no longer physically fit for war service, being disabled-by bronchitis. His character says he was ;V a good labourer.&quot;He produces a certificate from Dr. Sloman of Bedford, acting -for.Dr. Walter Sharpin, the man&apos;s own doctor, who is called up, to the effect that he is quite unable to work owing to bronchitis and emphysema of both lungs; his condition is quite hopeless, and he is losing flesh.The Medical Members of the Tribunal examined Daniels. In their opinion he was probably unfit for the Army when he attested: he will never be any better, but probably worse, and his Army life hastened the progress of his degenerative change.The Tribunal is unanimously of opinion that he is disabled by unfitness, and that such unfitness is attributable to or aggravated by military service in &quot;consequence of the present war.Case No. 1. &apos;. ^    &quot;In the matter of William Atherstone Gardner, No. 41533/H. Decision of the Tribunal delivered on Thursday, August 30th, 1917-.Gardner was aged 40; enlisted August 17th, 1915. He was dis-charged on December 10th, 1915, after 116 days&apos; service, with a gratuity of  15.   Gardner appeals. -In Army Form B. 204, under date August loch, 1915 (the application for discharge), the cause of objection is stated &apos;:-1. Ankyldsis of right thumb. &apos;; /2. Poor physique.Across this is written&apos;: &quot;Becommended for B.A.M.C. Hopitals at home, A. Connor, Colonel fr.M.I.B.A.C.&quot;Army Form B. 178, under date December 10th, 1915, says he was &quot; considered medically unfit for further military sendee, K B 392, in. cc&quot;Army Form B. 179, under date April 23rd, 1917 (the invaliding report), gives the sole cause of his disability as &apos;&quot; Ankylosis of right thumb,&quot; but states that he has &quot; had pneumonia since his discharge.&quot;. Upon the matter coming before the Surgeon-General on May 23rd, 1917, he decided that the man&apos;s present condition can-not be regarded for pension purposes as due.to or aggravated by service, though his capacity for earning a&apos;livelihood is diminished
T/lOths. &apos; The Surgeon General-remarks J;hat this decision, is given !&apos;In view of his.service and&apos; no special hardship or exposure, and the fact that A.E.B. 204 does not mention, the cause of his present incapacity,&quot;; - &apos;-&apos;-.&apos;---&apos;:;-. r. :j-; If. the. decision has. to be given on the documents before* us, it cannot.be doubted that the man appears to have been discharged because of a disability to his thumb which was: not caused in the Army, and.the decision would be in accordance with, the facts in the documents. .-.        - - &quot; &apos;This case again illustrates the danger of: relying: wholly upda documents. - -   - -      -    - -&apos;/;The true facts about the man&apos;s. thumb are beyond doubt.- About six years, ago he had a bicycle accident in which; his. right thumb was fractured. He was: treated at the -London Hospital-, and later at King&apos;s College Hospital as an in-patient for two, weeks,; where a. piece of bone was removed. This story- he told the, doctor, who filled up. A.E.B. 179, andj he has.repeated, it to us.     -  .:.On his Medical History Sheet;A.F.R 178,. his physical.develop-ment is, marked; &quot; Pair.&quot; . He. is. said: to. have no, slight.defects sufficient to cause rejection.; : The.sheet. is. marked, by some-one; &quot; Suitable,for B.A.M.C.&quot; Gardner tells-.us-that the doctor-noticed his thumb, as no, doubt; he, must-have, done.-     -        --;-/-&apos;;It seems clear that the condition of; his, thumb, is the same, now as.it-was when lie entered, the Army; and it.had been, in thaLcon-riitiom for severalyears.v -He was accepted as; fit. for service, with the-.thumb in.its present..- condition; and- he- didr his. work, with the thumb.in that- condition, and. in. our view o% the facts the statement that he was unfit for service by reason of the disability of Ankylosis of the thumb is incorrect.,;&apos;.&quot;;..;. - &apos;The man&apos;s-, own. statement, of the; circumstances: leading.to. his discharge are as follows..., He states that-before August. 1915, he was a master.decorator at Leytonstone, and worked himself and/ was able to lift weights and do his ordinary work. He had con-gestion of the lungs four years ago, and the cycle accident some six years ago. He is a member of the Independent Order of 0dd: fellows, and the Secretary of his branch has sent us the detailed information of his illnesses, showing that his last illness prior to his joining the Army was November, 1912, &quot; Influenza, six days,&quot; the doctors certificate of which is produced. - .He was, therefore, an apparently healthy man carrying on the daily work;.of a decorator without illness from November, 1912, to August, 1915. *&apos;His first work. in. the Army at Aldershot was repairing and decorating lavatories, which he seems to have done without diffi-culty. He says he caught two colds at the end of September and got wet through several times,.and slept in a draughty place. He says-his breathing became bad, and he was excused all physical drills and later on all drills. He was sent to Mount Vemon Hos-pital as an Orderly, and there he says he collapsed whilst trying to move a piano, and he was placed in the hopsital as a patient, and ultimately-invalided out of the Army.-The &quot;Hospital. Slieet of the New End Hospital, Hampstead, states . that&apos; he was in hospital from October 31st, 1915, to
&quot;November 10th, 1915, for a stiff right hand, the result of a biiyclo accident. This can hardly be correct, and in any case it is  ear the condition of the thumb was not the real cause of his discharge., and he was never treated for it in the Army Hospital.Army Form B. 204 certifies that: &quot;He is not likely to become an efficient soldier on medical grounds,&quot; but does not state the medical grounds. Enquiries have been made, we understand, at the Hampstead Hospital, but without result, and the only evidence now available of the &quot; medical grounds &quot;. are the man&apos;s statements, his former history, and his history after discharge.On his return to Leytonstone he says he tried to go on with his business, but was unable to do so. He suffered from Asthma, which he had not previously suffered from, and from April, 1916. onwards was.&apos;more or less in the doctor&apos;s hands. He was ordered to give up his business and go&apos;to Leigh-on-Sea, and there he had Pneumonia.. He is now incapable of doing any hard work or work of a continuous nature (see the letters and certificates of Dr. Winch, April 26th, 1917, dating back to April, 1916, and Dr. Yallance, April 23rd, 1917, and June 3.1st, .1917). Since his discharge from the Army he has been more or less unfit to work.The Medical Members of the Tribunal examined Gardner. They consider him a man of poor physique who should not have been accepted for the Army.The evidence seems to show that Gardner, though not a strong man, was capable of working at his business under the conditions of civil life, but that he was not strong enough to stand Army con-ditions. These have led to a breakdown which render him unfit and incapable of work. :.The Tribunal is unanimously of opinion that he is disabled by tmfitness, and that such unfifcness is attributable, to or aggravated by military service in consequence of present war.
Circular No. 17.Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House,Millbank, S.W.1,September, 1917.APPEALS TRIBUNAL.Sir,Referring to Circular No. 10 of the 1st August, 1917, relative to the above-mentioned subject, I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to state that on further consideration he proposes to make certain modifications in the procedure indicated therein.In that Circular it was requested that Local Committees should furnish the men concerned with any help required in drawing up their appeals. This would have ensured applications being rendered in such a way as to present the cases more readily for reconsideration. Mr. Hodge is anxious, however, that, in addition to this help given to the man, the Ministry should also have the direct assistance of the opinion of the Local Committee on the case.He has, therefore, arranged that all men, whose invaliding may be found by the Medical Boards to be not attribntable to, or aggravated by Naval or Military Service, shall be informed that if they wish to appeal against this decision, they should, in the first instance, repre-sent their cases to their Local Committees. It is not, of course, proposed that the burden of deciding on these cases should be thrown upon these bodies, but that the opinion of a carefully selected Sub-Committee, who would actually interview the man, and collect any relevant evidence, should be made available, to the Minister for his great assistance in determining the matter.The procedure to be adopted in dealing with an application in this matter is as follows: On receipt of the application in this..respect the Secretary of the Committee should refer to the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Millbank, S.W.1, in the case of a sailor, or to the Ministry of Pensions, Royal Hospital, Chelsea, in the case of a soldier, for the medical and other relevant papers in the case. When these documents (or certified copies of them) are received, arrangements should be made for the man to appear before a special Sub-Committee (if possible, including the Medical Referee, when such officer is appointed) who, after hearing the man and any necessary evidence on his behalf, should record their opinion of the causation of the man&apos;s disability. .-., The type of evidence relevant to the case would be -; (1) That of the man&apos;s ordinary medical attendant as to his health -v    prior to enlistment.: (2) That of the man&apos;s Insurance Society, if he belongs to one, as .&apos;\.   :    to sickness benefits prior to enlistment. &apos;,(3) That of the man&apos;s employer as to time dost through illnessprior to enlistment. (4) The opinion of the Committees Medical Referee, to whom ;. the man should be sent if the Referee is unable to sit on the Sub-Committee. : :--V(15359)   70 pfs.   9/17.. M. &amp;S.&apos; &apos;
The Sub-Committee should cousider this evidence in conjunction with what appears in the findings of the Medical Board, and, having recorded their opinion, direct the Secretary to forward it with^the papers and with any evidence obtained in the investigation to die relevant Branch of the Ministry.As great weight will be attached by the Minister to this opinion, it is necessary that it should be given only after most careful consideration of all the evidence available.  .    :*It should be carefully noted that this procedure, as did that laid down in Circular No. 10, applies only to cases of men who have been refused pensions on the ground that their disabilities are not attributable to or aggravated by service. It is necessary to emphasize this point, because already a large number of the forms supplied with that Circular have been used for appeals of other kinds, such as inadequacy of pension, &amp;c.In all other types of appeal the Local Committees should use their present methods of representing cases for further consideration.A copy of the Form of Notice which will be sent to men whose claims to pension are rejected, and who therefore receive gratuities only, is attached.

COLONY TREATJJS1IT FOR TUBERCULOSIS.The Y/hele question *f &quot;Farm Colonies&quot; ii mscst interesting, but id one which should be approached with ?raat cautionsIt has been suggested that Farm Colonist nMuli provide accommodation  or (1) patients tilth advancing disease*re not likely to live very long. (2) patients in whom the disease has permanently impaired working capacity and who art yst likely to be for a considerable time under satisfactory conditionsbut who will probably quickly break down if they return to their former mode of life. (3) patients who need treatment over long periods to answer consolidation of the processes of repair and (4) suitable patients with ^arly disease who need reeducation and training.    Fe doubt the wisdom for administrative reasons of treating all these ol&amp;ims in the same institution and suggest thai! for &amp; time at least until experience has be*x&amp; gainedmain function of the Colony should be to deal with the last named group e$ cases, aud to aim at the re-education of suitable patients (see P*r*2j in new occupations which will enable them to obtain suitable and adequately paid situations and to live and work under conditions favourable fcc the maintenance of healths2*    The class of case suitable for treatment in a Colony consists of those in Whom there appeari to be a good chance of obtaining permanent arrest of the disease.    The patients should therefore have disease cf very limited extentj   -be non-fcbrila and have passed satisfactorily through a period (say three months) of sanatorium observation and treatment^    If tho patients wore carefully selected all would be able to do a fair amount of work from the first and relatively few relapses would be likely to occur under treatment.36    2fhe patients should also bo men of good character whose former occupation had been unsatisfactory and who are willing and anxious tc learn a now trade which can be i&amp;ugfai and practised afterwards under good conditions,4*    The trades wfattjadchouidn^httaught should be such as will enable the patients to earn an adequate wage under satisfactory conditions, as this will   $ctsanee immeasurably their ahanco of keeping well.    We are of opinion that it is preferable %o teach trades   in the exercise   cf which  under relatively good conditions, a patient is likely W earn a flood income than to re-educate patients in occupations * which can fee carried out under full open-air conditions but which are not5*    It should also be borne in mind that the majority of the patients will be accustomed to town life and will find country life very monotonous.   In a large number of cases it will be found that if these men are trained only in agriculture.1well paid.For this reason we do not think that undue stress -sheuld be laid upon training in agriculture and we gugg&amp;st that the term &quot;Farm Colony&quot; might suitably be amended to &quot;Training Colony&quot;.v/srk
tfork they will ultimately revert te town life and take nt rml advantage of their training.6* tfe are gonerally of opinion that the Colony shouldgive training suitable manual accupafciena in the exelroise of which there is a good prospect of the patient being able te aseure goed wages and that eomplete training in any branch of agricultural work should be reserved for those patients who are so situated that it is certain they will make use of tht agricultural training when received.7. Y&apos;orkera in skilled trades should however tee carefullyinstructed in allotment work, so that they may ultimately be able^-. to supplement their earnings from their special trades and that they may secure health outdoor exercise.    iffe think that every patient should be given the care of an allotment during his stay in the colony.g. At the present time we are unable to adviie in detailas te the kind ef trades suitable for teaching but we are making further enquiries.    Such occupations as carpentry, motor driving or repairing/ electrical work would all be suitable.9. In regard Vc agriculture it is possible that it may bedesirable to train men in small holding rather than in general ., farm work.    In the case ef * man with a limited amount cf capital it is possible that he&quot; would ultimately develop a small holding of his own.    Co-operation is probably essential if small holdings are to produce adequate returns and the desirability of developing snail holdings on a co-operative b&amp;gi$ in the immediate neighbourhood of the colony might be borne in mind.     Suitable patients might ultimately be transferred to tfcese J holdings from the colony.10.        ftith regard to the period of residence of patients&apos; upon,: f the colony it is improbable that a man can be re-educated/in any-new occupation to enable hlmHo obtain an adequately paid/&apos; situation in less than a year, and this is the period which on medical grounds is thought /ty many to be desirable:   further enquiry however is needed with regard to this point.11.        With regard to buildings required in connection with the   I colony the greatest simplicity should bf aimed at.     Elaborate hespital accommodation is not needed.     So far as the man are concerned the provision of temporary wards, day-rooms, etc, appear! to be all that is necessary and the cost of these at the present time need not exceed  50 per bed.     Developments could be made frcaij time te time as required by the erection of wooden Army huts of which there will be an abundant supply after the war.Special buildings will be required for the purposes.of the various trades and we suggest tentatively that adequate work-shop accommodation for 40 Patients could be erected for about 1.000 J* /hmWith regard tt the buildings to be used in connection \fwith the farm and small holding work, these should be simple in \p character and might to a large extent be erected by the patients themselves.
12*       It is important that tho colony should fee situated wiihin easy nccoss Of * railway feoth for convenience in the, despatch and receipt af geeds and for the easy visiting of the patients1 friendsIt is important that every patient In the colony should fcs under the special supervision ef an experienced medical m.n* Susa msa are at the present time mrst difficult to obtain.    Xt will appear wise ttherefore, that if a colony or colonies are developed they should be In close proximity to existing first class sanatoria,The radical Superintendent cf the Sanatorium misfit then act as Xtedioal Of fleer of the Celony*The general mwgeaent of the oolony should be. under the central ef a Director, who in all medical matters would act under the stereotion of the Mediae!

With regard to the question as to whether It would foe de desirable to start ca&amp;e or more colonies, we would point out that xnesueJest is In an experimental stage, and that therefore ii would be wise to go slowly in the matter.    At the present time m canned state what proportion of patients will fulfil the conditions set out In two and three above with regard te suit&quot; ability for admission to such a Colony.- tinder the circumstances we think that only tne aoleny should fee started which shculd provide training for a limited number of patients In certain selected trades In .addition to agriculture and that developments should take place in the ilght of experience*

APPENDIX x. TRAIiUHQCircular letter which is being sent to the i.iinisterfs Kcpresenta-tivea.It appears to the Minister of Pensions that the work of Joint Committees in connection with schemes of Training may be substantially facilitated by their being supplied with certain information which is now in the possession of the Ministry. I am accordingly to furnish you with the following lists1. List (with Synopses) of all schemes submitted to the Ministry by Local Committees within the area of your Joint Committee (List A).2.      List of cases within your area where the same subject is Taught in more than one place, so that there may be danger of overlapping (List B). ,    - .3*        List of Local Committees within your area who have not yet submitted schemos to the Ministry (List C).4. List of the more important Technical Schools within your area which have not yet been included in any scheme of training disabled soldiers or sailors (List D).     -5.        List of local industries characteristic of localities within your area which are not provided for by any scheme which has been submitted to the Ministry.   This list is taken from the census of 1911, so it is possible that it may not be up to date.6.       List of General Industries not peculiar to any special locality, for training in which it does not appear that any considerable provision has been made (List E).It is of course possible that some of thfc industries mentioned may not prove suitable for the training of disabled men in your area, either on account of the nature of the industries themselves or on account of the probable difficulty of ultimately finding employment for men trained in them.   It is also possible that some of the Institutes mentioned may not prove available or.suitable;   but you will no doubt be appealed to by your Joint Committees for advice as to the lines on which they can -best develop their activities;   and this letter is accordingly sent for purposes of information and suggestion, so that if they should desire to take action the relevant facts may so far as possible be in your possession.
APPENDIX, XI. TRAINING.Memorandum of an interview with Oaptain Marti* of the raeas Military Forces of Canada which took placa at: the Ministry onthe 80th August,1917.Captain Martin attended a meeting to discuss a suggestionwhich has been *a.4* as to the training of men discharged from theCanadian Forces.He stated that the Canadian Authorities are extremelyreluctant to discharge men in England, but that- in certain excep-tional cases, e.g. where a man has relatives or friends in England and has prospects of reasonable employment here, they are prepared to do so.   The suggestion made is that these men should be trained at the expense of the Ministry of Pensions in England as if they had been members of the Imperial Forces.Captain Martin pointed out that the Canadian Government have certain vocational training established in Canada, and afca prepared to give the benefit of this training to men who had their homes in Canada, but had joined the Imperial Forces, and on die-charge wished to return to Canada.   He considered that this would be a fair equivalent.   It was pointed out that thftre might be trouble with Labour if it were thought that disabled Canadians were likely to be left in England to compete In the labour market here.Captain Martin undertook to procure more definite information as to the number 6t men discharged, etc, and to furnish it to the Ministers after which a further Conference might be held.It was agreed that in no case would the Minister be asked to be responsible for the treatment of these men.
kfm&amp;iM xii.TRAINING*riXE ADVISORY CCUJIWEES. Report for Week ending 5th September, 1917,Building.     August 30th, 1917.The detailed work of this Committee has been done through various &quot;craft&quot; Sub Coirsriittees.FaintinR.The Joinfc Sub Committee for Pointing, consisting of three   . representatives of employers and Yforkpeople, recommended that(a) The period of training should be 5  weeks.(b) That the training should be given partly in the workshop and partly in the technical school.(c) That at the end of the year1s training the employer should pay a minimum wage of 27/6 a week.(d) That at the end of two years from the completion of the period of training the disabled man should be paid the district trade union rate.Plumbing.The Report of the Plumbing Committee suggested that disabled wenmight be trained for certain specialised processes in plumbing. This Report was severely criticised by a larger Committee who suc^ested that a disabled man ought to be allowed to get an all-round knowledge of the trade.    The Report was referred back to the Sub-Committee.The Reports from the Hasonry Sub-Committee and the Carpenters and Joiners will be considered at the next meeting. There is at present considerable opposition on the part of the Carpenters and Joiners Unions to admitting disabled men into the trade. .Leather floods^The Secretary of the Trade Advisory Committee attended a Conference ef Manufacturers in the Trade at \/alsall on 30th August,  -when the proposed Scheme was eonsidered.    There was some opposition to the proposal of a six months period of training, twelve months being considered necessary, &quot;but the draft scheme was ultimately approved.    There was a keen desire that the Scheme should some into operation aa soon as possible.Mechanical Dentistry.This ContTtittee consists of representatives of the British Dental Assotlotion.    The British Dental Association hitherto has opposed the training of disabled men as dental mechanics on the ground that the dental mechanic often sets up as an unregistered dentist and hence is a danger to the profession,     The Committee at its first meeting agreed to lend their oo-operation to the training of disabled men as dental mechanics subject to certain reasonable safeguards and to the training being under the control of members of their Association.
ywBWDpc.; XIII.&apos; &apos; TRAINING. Kassa c.   Interview with General Russell.-   ^MgftWgrfWWl fS*W.** ;General Russell was interviewed on the $th Instant* on tho subject of the supply of masseurs and specially with regard to the qualifications to be required.   He produced a statement of the qualifications required for membership of the Almeric P*i*et Haesagc corps and explained the Korking of the system.   The Almcric Facet tfeesage Cirps ie in a   e . position somewhat analogous to that occupied by the registered Society of Pharmaceutical Chemists us regards chemists or the Royal College Of Physiclew as regards registered Medical Practitioners, though, of course, the recognition given by it is not required fer ether than Army purposes.The question of increasing the supply of na&amp;seurs was discussed and, as a result of the aenversation, it appeare that it tfould be useful not only for the training of disabled men, but else for the training of widows, to ooja:iunieate both tfith the Almerie Paget Corps and the Incorporated Society of Uaeseurs and obtain from them a list of the physical training o*lleC63 or hospitals for masseurs which are recognised by them as giving m adequate ceurse of training for the grant of a certificate.General Russell said that they had about 1,700 massousses (uomen) and about 45 masseurs (iften) and it is understood that there is considerable opening for the employ-ment of masseurs at present yrhilst the demand will continue after the War.   He added that they are trying to give some **f the men at St. Dunstan*s training in massage, but naturally blind men require longer training.

That a period in each day*s school training should be set apart for the opportunity of a lesson in literature or aeme other humftnistie study, so that the discharged Soldier or Sailor could be assisted to a wider life than ths purely economic one.6.   That where possible the Pensions   Ooiwiitiee should sec that the disabled Soldier or Sailor shall follow hie previous occupation.TRAINING.Besolutiona agreed to by local Trade Unions.
TUAIIIIKQ.jAemtfrandum ef an Interview with Mrs. Shaka spear-) Rid A^sU&amp;rman James representing the Mrmingham Yiar Peaaiens SetaaiVtee.A full dismiss ion af the possibilities ef the itohnicel schools in Birmingham for providing Instruction for disabled men took place on the 3rd September,Alderman  Tames stated that the three existing ta^hnlaal schools, namely, the Central School^ the Asten Seheci and the H&amp;ndsworth School were taken over almost entirely by the Ministry tt Munitions, and that very few places were available far disabled men,    He considered that it was und&amp;wirable that the few disabled men far wham there was accommodation should, remain In these schools, as the training was not sufficient to. give them a chance af learning t-heir trade se thoroughly as te earn a satisfactory living in the future,y/ixilat the men themselves became dissatisfied when they found that men whe were being trained for munition work to %*t reoeiving  2 a week as against their 27/6.     For thase reasons the Lrcal Education Authority hav* recently acquired on a three years lease with the right to extend to five years, certain premises in which engineering (especially electrical and Mechanical engineering) might be taught.     This was done in reldanoe on a   . premise verballyfiven by the Local War Pensions Committee that the expense would be. cms te a large extent by the Minister of pensions.    On these premises it would be possible te accommodate 200 or more men and they would be available for all the men for whom no similar training is at present provided in the Joint Area.    The men are selected at an interview by the Special Committee formed for that purpose, which has praeleal men among its members, and men are interviewed *,y the Principal of the Technical School who usually arranges that thay shall be taken for a week an trial.With regard te the fees which it is prepesed that the Minister of Pensions should pay, Alderman James stated that for the evening classes the fee charged would be the same as that charged to ordinary students.There are at present day classes.     If they were held, the Lac al Education Authority desire to charge a fee of 5/- a woek, (which would go towards the rent,ote., ef the new premises) plus the coat ef extra teachers, and he suggested that there should be about one teacher for each 15 men.    Alderman James undertook te put forward a statement showing what teachers he would propose to employ, what salaries they should sa paid, and what suajests should be taught by them.Kr, Here stated that the Minister had ae pawar to pay fees far capital      enditure, and he did net think that the Treasury would give any such power.With regard te general training af disabled men Mrs.Shoha spear stated that the paly institution net provided by the. umrzz saturation Authority which was now being used was Lawrence * sCollege, at which eommeraiol training was given.In a very few eases training in warksheps has been arranged for specially.   In the leather trade, in beotmaking and in *ewel*e*i making no fees have been paid in any ease.   The local Committee do^re to knety exactly what details the Minister wishes tc have, In fcrder aahames af training may be sanctioned either in the Local Education -Authority^ Technical Saheols or in factories and workshops .hi    i n iin .........      -  A$r*&quot;*
APPENDIX     XVI.mend cutting.   Visit of Major Mitchell to Brighton, 6th September.1917*As arranged I visted Brighton with Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Cripp3 of tha Eccentric Club.   Vie first met the Mayor and Mr. Hugh Talbot, the Secretary of the Brighten War Pensions Committee.   Me discussed the arrangements for Training in Diamond Cutting, and I impressed upon Mr. T&amp;Sbot the importance of placing as many of the local Disabled Men as possible in the Training Course, as it was the intention to erect   Factory for these men to work in.   Consequently, it was desirable to train the men whose homes were close at hand.We then went with the Mayor and inspected a Building that seemed suitable for tho Factory, and Mr * Oppenheimer &amp;*ve the commission to offer  4,000 for the Premises.The question of a Hostel for the men In Training was next considered, and we visited a House on Park Terrace, very finely situated with the use of large gardens in the Rear -ilr. Oppenheimer was very pleased and at once gave  1000 for 2 years maintenance of the Hostel which will be opened under the Eccentric Club Scheme.fle then visited the Technical Schools, and found the men very interested in their work.   Remarkcbld progress appears to Lave been made,.and.Mr.. Oppenheimer stated that the-soak the men were doing was already of a productive character.    11 ware working or. px.ec.vous Stones some of them were cf&apos;the value of.  56? a-plene. eno. altogether the men were working on Stones of the tota3 value of ever  20,000,    It is interesting ic rote that  . at my suggestion Mrv..Oppenherrner had approached tho De-Beers Company, and the D?cmend Syrdicate with the view to their joining in the Training Scheme, and both cordially endorsed the proposal; the De-Beers Company placing  2,500.towards the expenses incurred in setting up the Training Course.Mr. Oppenheimer then visited with us the 2 Suuash Courts, and the Mayor having given his sanction to have these covered in, Mr. Oppenheimer gave instructions for the work to be immediately proceeded with; the Cost of which together with the fitting up of   21111b for another 40 Sfen, he will pay.
r TRAINING.Report on Scheme, &amp;c, submitted or sanctioned in week ending 5th September 1917.1.     The Local Committee for Cardiff have submitted proposals for training disabled men as Cinematograph operators on the lines suggested by Mr. Thomas, Chairman of the D.3.S. Local Cinema Trade Advisory Committee, and their proposals have been sanctioned as part of a general scheme for training. -  The period of training is to be thirteen weeks and the cost, outside the theoretical course, is nil, the whole practical work being undertaken bjj the Instructors and the Committee free of charge.    The training centre appointed by the Local Committee is the Penylan Cinema, Mr, Tonkin of this theatre who Is highly qualified having been appointed practical instructor.     The future prospects of the men on completion cf their course are very good and permanent positions for at least a (fosSrEt operators can be found without difficulty.The men when trained have to pass a thorough examination, and are then given certificates certifying them as thoroughly qualified and capable operators, this being a permanent record which should always enable them to obtain employment in any part cf the country.The Local Committee has been asked to forward particulars as to the Institution v/here the theoretical course is to be provided and the fees that will be payable in respect thereof.2.     The Local Committee for Aberdeen have submitted proposals v) train disabled men in   Agriculture^Horticulture and Forestry at the Worth of Scotland Agricultural College, CraibBtone.     The necessary enquiries having been completed the scheme has been sanctioned. :;&quot;Oreat importance is attached to the proper selection of the men who are to undergo training at Agricultural Colleges, and the * Board of Agriculture for Scotland have been requested to arrange for this work.to be undertaken by their travelling instructors, who are constantly in touch with the farmers in their districts, and probably in many cases have personal knowledge of the men who are proposed for training and could advise both as to their suitability for the work and as to their prospects of futitre employment.Where the Instructors have no such previous knowledge of the men applying for training., it has been suggested that the Local Committee concerned showld ai-r^nge for an interview and that the men selected by the I:iit: *ue.-Joi e oiiculd be sent to the College for a probationary course during wli?.uh the Principal would be able to form an opinion as to their suitability,The Local Comittoe have been requested to take the necessary steps to bring this scheme into operation at the earliest possible moment.
3.        The Joint Committee for Leinster and Connaught have applied for leave to recognise the work-raoras of the Soldiers and Sailors Help Society at 66, Lower Mount Street, Dublin, or other suitable place as may be arranged, as an approved work-shop.(1)     For the training of men (preferably those who have lost a leg) in Backet-making and other allied Industries, such as Basket-repairing, Chair-making and Toy-making out oi remnants.(2)      For the training of men in making toys or small useful wooden articles, which a man, unable through injury to learn a trade or take permanent employment, might make at home, and thereby materially augment his pension.(3)     As a Depot for the disposal of all such goods &apos;    - made by Disabled Men*These workshops are being recognised as a temporary measure pending arrangements for training in more remunerative forms of industry and subject to the following conditions:-(i) As to Basket making.(a) The training should last for at least six months.(b) Preference should be given to those men who have lost a leg.(c) The Minister must be satisfied by the report of some person competent to judge that the instruc-tor is a competent man.(d); The men should be selected by some competent . person who is able to Judge whether they are s likely to benefit by the training, and their \  work should be periodically inspected to ascertain that the training is satisfactory.(e)   The Committee is not to commence the training of - any man until they have satisfied themselves .     that there is an opening for him in a factory or workshop at a reasonable wage(ii) As to the toy making etc.,:;&apos;::,;,y (a)   Training should last not more than three months.(b) No men should be trained except those who are so greatly disabled that it is impossible for them to take up any more remunerative employment,(c) The Soldiers&apos; and Sailors1 Help Society should undertake to give facilities for disposal of all articles produced by the men after they have been trained.. The Local Committee have been Informed that a fee not exceeding 7/6 per man per week will be sanctioned to cover the expenses incurred by the Society in the provision of more adequate workshops and Instructors.

MINISTRY 0  PENSIONSREPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER. ffor week ended 5th September, 1917....    ORGANIZATION BRANCH * ,Extracts from Reports of Inspectors of Acoounts.KBTOEW LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organization and administration of this Committee is reported to be only moderately good.    The Clerk, who is also County Clerk for Renfrew, appears to be too busy to devote mueh time to War Pensions work, which is largely undertaken by a lady clerk but it is rather too much for her.Little or nothing has been done in the way of disable-ment work and the Inspector has written a strong letter to the Local Committee on the subject.    There is no Disablement Sub-Committee and the District Committees seem to be left to deal with matters as they wish.    All the officials are honorary and the Inspector thinks it would conduce to more efficient work if the Local and District Clerks and Treasurers were paid for their services.PAISLEY LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organization of this Committee appears to be fairly good and calls for no special remark.COUNTY Off CARDIGAN LOOAL COMMITTEE.The matter of organization in a County like Cardigan bristles with difficulties and it is almost impossible to get a satisfactory basis to start from.The County seems determined not to join the South Wales Scheme for the treatment and training of disabled men.    The Inspector pleaded with the Committee to reconsider their decision which they promised to consider again.Application has been made to the Ministry of pensions for permission to appoint an officer in the dual capacity of Secretary and Enquiry Officer;   the application having been refused there was a stormy scene in consequence.    The request Is being renewed.
OGMOBE AKD QABW LOCAL OMM,A farther visit to this Committee was paid,by the Inspector on 29th ultimo to ascertain what progress- had been made with the re-organization.    He reported that progress is very slow but having regard to the former ohaotic condition the situation may be regarded as fairly satisfactory.There are no discharged disabled men in the district.COUBTY CORE LOCAL cmmit^.^^^v^^^^^^^^^^^A^^:^^^^&quot;^^::^^/^^^^^^^^^^^^/^^^^^^^^:^^^      ^The aocounts of the County Cork Local Committee are kept in a very satisfactory manner.    There are 22  District Committees and their expenses are estimated at  630 for the period ending 31st March, 1918, while the expenses of the Local Committee are estimated at  1,960.LAJTOASHIKB LOCAL COMMITTBB. - s ^ vGarstang Subcommittee, -This is a wide agricultural district and there are a few eases for supplementary allowances.

The Treasurer has made special efforts to recover outstanding advances with success.    The accounts, books, pay-sheetsV etc., are in particularly good order.     Generally a very good Committee,
EXTRACTS FROM SEifBRAL REPORTS Qg IffSPBCTOrtS.    .. IRELAND.The number of War Pensions Looal Committees in being at the time of his taking up office- on 19th February, 1917, was 29.. since then six. other Committees have been formed and there still remain five Counties where the work has not been officially commenced.. 32 Committees have been visited.   The work carried out by the various Committees differs very much in extent and ae a matter of course the Local Committees in the towns have worked largely in excess of those in the Counties, more especially in Belfast, Dublin, Cork, waterford, and Londonderry, but in some of the Counties very little has as yet been done.Though on the whole accurately kept, the accounts were not alike in any two places and it has been the Inspector&apos;s endeavour to establish a more uniform system and also a more concise one to reduce the labour in keeping accounts: by the introduction of Receipt and Expenses Book,   In some places the reoords have been kept in card form and no general register has been used, but books so arranged to contain the full record of all applications are about to be kept by many Committees and it is hoped that the others will soon adopt the same, means of registration as it is most important that an absolute record of each individual case should be kept to which reference oan be made at any moment.The work of a large number of Committees has been altogether voluntary up to the present but as the. volume of business increases it has been found by several of the Secretaries who are also County officials, to be impossible to continue their services and paid Secretaries will have to be. appointed in their places.As regards disabled and discharged.sailors and soldiers, little or nothing has yet been done with reference to training but a small proportion of men have been found-employment by Local Committees, chiefly from the Labour Exchanges.   In Belfast a branch of Lord Roberts&apos; Memorial ?und has been established where carpentry, etc.,is taught and 26 men are being trained.   Through the efforts of the Joint Disablement Committees it is hoped that the scarcity of hospitals where special treatment can be given in Ireland will shortly be remedied.Rent allowances outside the towns in Ireland are a dead-letter as with very few exceptions rent never approaches 4/-.SCOTLAND.Since the commencement of his duty on 10th April last the Inspector visited and inspected the acoounts of twelve Local Committees and 25 District Committees, in several cases on more than.one occasion,   fie reports that the organization and adminis-tration of ten of the Looal Committees were fairly good and in the course of being further improved.   In two oases he found that the organization and administration were very inefficient.   Of the 25 Distriot Committees visited the organization and administration were fairly good, except in some of the Distriot Committees of the two Local Committees referred to above.
i. mGenerally speaking the Local Committees have been adhering to the Regulations of the Statutory Committee, the conduct of the Local Committees depending very largely on its officers.    Bo matter how enthusiastic and capable the members of the Looal Committee may be, the greater part of the work must of necessity be attended to by the officers and In some instances particularly in District Committees, considerable trouble has been experienced in obtaining the right class of man to act as clerks and treasurers.. The Inspector closes his report by stating that with the exception of the two Local Committees referred to, all the Local Committees he hat visited either are or soon &apos;will be in good working order.6th September, 1917..--4-

Please convey my best wishes to those present aid my sincere thanks for their undertaking the work.    Seo4 luaiirM -them in it.&quot;. . .and further addressed the meeting as follows.-&quot;The day, possibly, was not well selected ae certain ef your Member $ are also of necessity absent at the Blackpool Conference.    The date for the dissolution of the Statutory Committee was, however, fixed some little time ago and it was necessary that the Special Grants Committee should commence their functions immediately afterwards so that there might be no accumulation of cases to be dealt with by t&amp;e$.It le not necessary for m to explain on this occasion the duties of the new Committee.    they were set forth in the terns of * recent legislation in the letter I sent you when I had the pleasure of asking you to be Members.    Briefly, they are to determine for the Ministry matters of faet, t^ make discretionary grants under Peculations and to suggest such modifieatlone of the Regulations as* toAPPENDIX X*XI* SPECIAL GRANTS C0i4kIl?TEE.
i$ */ou may appear necessary.     In this last raatter there are three points that I would mention for your consideration *First- of all. It has been repressnt&amp;d t$ me by the Beif&amp;si gnd other Local Committees that any change in the ftrm of Part IX Regulations would involve much dislocation of the Committee*e &amp;rrangemements.    Secondly, I would mention that it was the view of :fr, Barnes which I have no dbubt Is shared by his successor, that any change in the Peculations should be In the direction of simnlt* ficfttion and wider discretion^   Thirdly, X would remind.you.with regard to discretion given to Local Committees, that they &amp;re not auite all $f tho type of Kent, Bir-ningham and Portsmouth *    There are those, mainly by the margins of the western s&amp;a$, that would like to receive greater Hberty than they could rightly use*I will not keep you now any longer from your new dutifs. It is not necessary that I should talk about the sympathy which the Committee will share with the Ministry for our clients who have suffered in order that this Country should still be Xree.  \ % would help them by work rather then by words.    In this work, Mr. Hodge anticipates receiving the greatest assistance from the Special Grants Committeej he is desirous in his turn of giving them Juch asslstavce as la in his power and for this purpose the services of Col,YStstton^ Mr, Hinks, myself and other members of his staff will always be avai-T-able, ; I need scarcely say Mr. On airman, if at any time you, ornwiy Member     the Committee wish to consult me in any matter, 1 shall b$ glad to &quot;give them any information andf for what it is worth, any advice that I can,&quot; :/ - The Chairman addressed the meeting and pointed -but the necessity for the Committeeof forming itself Into small Case Sections for dealing with cases arising in the various Branches,    He pointed out that it was important not to change the form of Part II of the Rtgulations, and that any change in the Regulations should be in the form of simplification and, If possible, wider discretion.It was agreed that the Special/Grants Committee should for the present meet every Tuesday at 52.30 p,m,^Z^/.;...;;/^ arrangement that the following shouldserve on the various Sections:/Y;7./Cases under Part I at the Regulations including Apprentice-ship Cases for the Mini$try:*Soles child,v --v.
