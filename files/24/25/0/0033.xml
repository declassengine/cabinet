RE AIRSHIP CONSTRUCTION,(Note by the &quot;Secretary, War Cabinet)X. The 1909 a Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence reported that there were good grounds for assuming that airships -will prove of great value to the llavy for scouting and recommended that one of a rigid type should be built at a cost of- 35,000.2. : In 1912 another Sub-Committee stated that they were ofopinion that the prospects of the successful employment of the rigid type of airship was not sufficiently favourable to justify the great cost, and recommended that naval experiments should be confined to the development of aeroplanes end hydro-aeroplanes but that the utmost vigilance should be taken by the...Admiralty in watching foreign developments of-the airship and that the present recommendation of the Sub-Committee should not be taken to prejudice a re-opening of the question should important developments o e cur.3, In 1913 a Technical Sub-Committee reported that it wasnecessary to contemplate in the near future the provision of airships :Of the largest size and power for the Naval Wing of the Royal -Plying Corps and that starting from the relative small airships which we already possess our procedure should be gradu-ally to;acquire larger airships until our personnel is able to handle the largest types built.     Further that the numerical standard.of the airship fleet to be maintained will require consideration as soon as a satisfactory type of vessel has been produced.It was admitted by this Committee that aeroplanes., owing to their superior mobility, night be found capable of destroying airships.The Committee recommended the purchase from the French of a Ion-rigid airship of the Astra-Torres type, with a cubic capacity of not more than 280,000 cubic feet-.     It being added that such an airship., though not capable of carrying out strategical reconnaissances at sea on a large scale, should prove useful for coast reconnaissance-.In July 1913 the Technical Sub-Committee was reassembled and stated their opinion that in view of the great progress  broad with regard to airships, end the many functions, impossi-ble to aeroplanes., which they could fulfil, the time had come to adopt a policy of active development., and they recommended, for instructional purposes the purchase of several small airships,  dding that everything tends to show that it is large aiships that are likely to be useful for Naval purposes.. In May 1914, the Air Committee reported that in October 1913 all the airships belonging to the Military wing had been (i    transferred to the Naval wing the latter being responsible in future for the development ox lightor-than-air craft in this Country and meeting the provision of airships for military purposes if they are required.
6.      At the outbreak Of war there were six airships (all non-rigid) capable of flying..     Three of abjut 360,000 cu.ft. capacity did considerable patrol work in the Channel during the passage of the B.E.F.    &amp;  t^ethree smaller ships, which originally belonged to the Military wing, one did a certain amount of flying at Dunkerque.7,      In Maroh 1915 instructions were given to build a very small non-rigid ship for anti-subuarine patrol, and from this originated the present type of S.S. Airship, which carries two or three men and has an endurance of 9 hours at a maximum speed of 52 miles per hour.8.       During the summer of 1915 &amp; somewhat larger non-rigid ship of the Astra type was designed and built for more extended coastal patrol.     From this the present Coastal class was developed.    These ships carry five men and have a full speed endurance of 12 fcfcurs at 52 miles per hour.    A type of ship, named the &quot;Coastal star&quot; has been designed to take the place of. the present Coastals and to provide greater protection and comfort to the crew.    The estimated speed and endurance is the same as for the present Coastal ships, but the crew is increased to &amp; in namber.9.      The North Sea type (non-rigid) was then designed and the first ship of this class carried out her trials in March 1917*     This class was intended for longer distance reconnaissance and convoy work etc    The normal crew is 9 and the endurance at a maximum speed of $0 miles per hour is 20 hours under normal conditions.10.

Of the above Rigid Airships, the 23 and 232 Classes must be regarded as training ships, or for use in local patrol and convoy work, and will be deleted as the 31 &apos;and 33 classes mature. The large body of efficient Airship Pilots which we have already trained need a few weeks in Rigids to complete their experience * Until the German Zeppelin L,,33 (on which our 3.3 c?.aoibaaoed;wasbrought down in Essex, we had to feel our way in the design of rigids and were consequently ten years behind the GermansThedesignour31 Clas3-is based on data obtained from a Swiss who worked in Germanyin the Schutte-iians factor:&apos;he building of Be9 and the &quot;23&quot;and &quot;232&quot; classes has enabled us to train skilled labour Duralumin work, and the Admiralty consider that with the Controller^ proposed re-organisation cf the Airship Technical Department, we shall be in a position to build one of the latest class Rigiue from each building berth every four months.   Pour such building berths are at present available; a further two will be ready within twelve months and it is now proposed, in the attached prog2ammes to add two more berths giving eight building berths in all capable of erecting at the rate of twenty-four &quot;33&quot; Type rigids a year   The Germans have a eapaoity of one ship every 12 days or approximately 30 Rigids a year.12.   The &quot;33&quot; Type Rigid would appear to be the type fully capable -of meeting the requirements cf the Admiralty War Staff and the proposal is to concentrate on building these airships.13. The total requirements of steel needed for the Admiralty programme is about 20,000 tons made uo as follows:-....99.1.   Building Shed. 3.   Housing Sheds, do   Sets of Windscreens for Housing Sheds, ,Tv,   ifon-rigid Shedsand Wind Screens..............All Hydrogen&apos; Plants...............Railway Sidings..................* * a * *3100 tons. 9300   &quot;2160it2700 &quot; 1700 &quot; 1000   &quot;19,960   &quot;
u        In consideration of the preliminary work necessary in settling and clearing the sites, producing designs and letting the contracts practically no steel will he required before December next.   In December and the subsequent months, approximately 500 tons a week will be wanted.   It will therefore be seen that a large part of the steel will not be required until our Home resources are more fully developed.14.

APPENDIX INecessity for Airships for Fleet Purposes.A Rigid Airship with its speed and endurance and ranee of vision can search,an area and provide the Siral in command of the Fleet with full information as to whether the enemy&apos;s vessels are present in less time than would he taken by a number of cruisers.The latest types of Rigids are of a range of approximately, 2,000 miles and can be used far beyond the limits of heavier-than-air craft.     They are unquestionably more effective-for extended Naval reconnaissance than any other type of craft, either surface or air.In fine weather a long range airship can effectively search an area of over iOO,000 square miles in from 40 to 50 hours.Though aeroplanes sent up from ships may enable us to deal with the German Scouting Zeppelins it does nut follow that the Germans will be able to deal similarly with cur airships because out larger forces will make the conuitions difficult for the German aeroplane-carrying ships.Furthermore, the requirements that may arise in connection wroh oceanic reconnaiusance and the escort of convoys should be taken into account.Enemy submarines are being built with increas-ing,range, gun power and sea-worthiness and undoubtedly the intention of operating further from our Western shores.rn^o +v,     JLcorToys are to te escorted by aircraftmore than 1^0 miles from the coaso it will have to be by ri^idSea t^e?r n0n-riSids 0f lonS endurance,  such as the North^A rigid airship might be invaluable for dis-Ll trV^SenCB 0f ? raider in the Atlanticone of these vessels kgain escape the high seas.ADMIRALTY (Operations Division) 24th August,  1917.
appendix n.A few instances of the employment of &quot;Airahi-ps on Fleet and Convoy work.(1) Prior to the battle of Jutland four Zeppelinscarried out extended reconnaissances to the westward while the High Seas Fleet proceeded up the Danish Coast, thereby allowing a concentration of the German cruiser force while ensuring that the Fleet was not cut&apos; off from its base.The C.*in-C. reported that at 4 a.m.*cn the morn-ing after the battle the Fleet engaged a Zeppelin for&apos;about five minutes during which the- Airship had ample opportunity to note and subsequently report the position and course of the British Fleet.(2) On August 19th when the Nottingham and Falmouthwere lost eight German Zeppelins were&apos;cruising between the lat-itudeg&apos; of 520 N, and&apos;560 N. and there is every reason to believe that under their direction the enemy*s submarines were concentrated on the route of the British Fleet.-(3), During the raid on the coast of England and thebombardment of Yarmouth on April 28th 1916, the enemy cruisers were accompanied by ten Zeppelins which scouted onboth flanks of the Squadron, 150 miles to the nor*h and 00 miles to the south.iil r*** v, 0n,A^8t 9th, 1917, an important American convoy ScilliL^nd1.^^? ah?
