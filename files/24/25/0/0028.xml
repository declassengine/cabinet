Colonel Jones(This Document isJjie Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.) ICirculated by the Secretary of State for India.CONFIDENTIAL.7Purchase of Silver for War Medals.Go:Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I would suggest that the purchase of silver should not be begun at present. India is in urgent need of every ounce of silver that can be procured, in order to maintain the convertibility of her notes, and thus avoid two very serious risks, viz., wide spread panic in India itself and the partial cessation of her vast export of war commodities to Europe. Incon-vertibility might bring about both of these results. Owing to the enormous purchases now being made for China and other countries, the amount of silver that can be got for India is far less than is desirable. Egypt suffers from a similar shortage, and has asked India for help. If the War Office, directly or indirectly, entered the market as a competitive purchaser, India&apos;s and Egypt&apos;s difficulty in getting the silver which they need would, in the present very sensitive and depleted state of the market, be appreciably increased. In addition, the price would probably rise, with far-reaching effects, in the first place on the exchanges between the United Kingdom and India, ultimately, perhaps, on the exchanges between the United Kingdom and other countries generally.Even from the point of view of the War Office, early purchase seeme undesirable. The demand for China, India, and other countries has raised the price in London to 46cZ. per standard ounce (31st August 1.9.17j, a price higher than has been quoted since 1891. The highest price quoted in any of the five years from 1909 to 1913 was 29f, and the lowest 23TV-Although a fall hereafter cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, I aim&apos; informed that it is extremely probable.To postpone the purchase of silver for war medals would, according to all probability, involve no appreciable risk of failure to issue tho medals in good time. Except when there is such an accumulation of exceptional demands as now prevails, 15,000,000 ounces, the amount required for medals, can be bought in a few weeks. In 1916-17 India alone bought more than 133,000,000 ounces (Le., an average of more than 11,000,000 ounces a month) at much lower prices than the present, in May 1916, 201 million ounces were bought for India.The manufacture of medals, apart from the engraving of names, ought not to take many weeks, to judge irom the capacity of the two Indian Mints, which together can turn out Rs. 55,000,000 a month.The slowest process in connection with medals appears to be the engraving of names, which can, it is said, be carried out at the rate of 3,500,000 a year if 25 machines are used. On this basis, 14,000,000 medals could be engraved in a year by 100 machines. The cost of 75 additional machines would probably be much less than the saving in the cost of silver if it is bought when the price has fallen below the present exceptional level. If 15,000,000 ounces were bought at 40cZ. (a price higher than had been touched for many years before 1917), instead of at the present price of 46J., the saving would be 375,000 .E. S.
