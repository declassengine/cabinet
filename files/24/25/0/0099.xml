1.3CBETDepartment of Information -   Intelligence . Bureau v;v;;;;82j Victoria Street PIW/010Weekly Beport on Italy., I : ;:.,&apos;:(September 6th, 1917) Foreign Relations    .The efforts of the moderates (represented prominently by the &quot;Oerrlgrg della Sera) to create an atmosphere favourable to a friendlyunderstanding with the Jugo-Slavs have been somewhat disconcerted ..........by the uncompromising declarations made by M. Pasie^in an interviewwith Signor Bevione in London whieh was published on August 19th inthe Qazzetta del Popolo.To the question why Serbia, who had never openly proposed union(1)with the Jugo-Slavs of Austria, had chosen this moment for doing so, and whether the new departure was a consequence of the Russian Be-volution as removing the chief obstacle to the union, Dr. Pasi* was unwilling to reply.The form of a united kingdom, he said, had been chosen in pre-ference to a federal constitution in order to avoid the difficulties of tracing boundaries between.tho inextricably confused racial ele-ments.There was no doubt a minority of Craats and Slovenes who de-sired union with Austria, but; the people as a whole was for union of all the. Southern Slavs with Serbia in a single i:tate.The closest and most sincere understanding and complete(1)   As a matter of fact the Serbian Parliament in November 1914unanimously endorsed M. PasieVs declaration in favour of unification;again in the Spring of 1916 the Prince Begont during his visit toLondtn openly adopted/of Unification in his reply to the British deputation. v
accord with Italy was one of the essential principles of Serbian action.     Italy having attained her own unity by virtue of the prin-ciple of nationality could not logically oppose the national unifi-cation of the Slavs.Reminded that Italy1s claim, based on grounds; of nationality and military security, to a part of the Dalmatian mainland had been guaranteed by troaty with the chief Entente powers, and asked whether he thought the presence of Italy in that territory reconcilable with the constitution of the new state, M Pasie replied as follows:&quot;In Dalmatia, excepting Zara, the vast majority of the popu-lation is Slav.    According to the Corfu agreement the new Serb-Croat-Slovene State is to comprise all the territories inhabited by compact nuclei of Slav population.&quot;What compensation were they inclined to make them?M. Pasie made no reply. .Was M. Pasi-e aware that tho British friends of Serbia be-lieved, according to Ante frumbio (who signed the Corfu agreement on behalf of the Austrian Jugo-Slavs), that a compromise between Italy and the Jugo-Slavs might be possible on the basis:.of a substi-tution of certain islands and the Bocche di Cattaro for the Dalmatian territory assigned to Italy by her treaty with the great powers? and would Serbia accept this compromise?M.Pasij       &quot;Ho.     Cattato is Serbian territory.     We could not con-sent to its being taken from us. &apos;Then what compensation did they propose? M. Pasic      &quot;Italy, by the acquisition of Triosto, Pola and Valona is assured of absolute supremacy in the Adriatic.     It should be remembered too that for long, long years we shell not be able to have a fleetE. Bevione. &quot;What advantages would Italy obtain froio an .ceord such as you;propose?&quot;
ii&amp;8i6&apos;     wThe....croation of a bond of profound, sincere and inalter-hle friendship with us which will permit of an intensified penetration a the part of your commerce, enterprise and culture;   the formation fa strong &quot;barrier against a Teutonic descent towards the Adriatic nd Aegean;   an instrument for the disintegration of Austria during jie war and a means towards the dismemberment of Austria in the treaty of peace.     Austria is in the worst condition in which she has ever been.     This information I have on certain authority:   Vienna is on the point of granting autonomy tc all the Nationalities of the Empire, reserving of course the unity of the army and of foreign policy.   That is a sympton af the gravest internal Weakness.     The moment has come for provoking the passage cf tho Southern Slavs of the Monarchy to de-clared and energetic opposition to the existing regime.   This wouldgive Austria her coup de grace.&quot;As to Macedonia, M. Pasi6 declared there could be no renuncia-tion of any sort nor in favour of anybody.If Montenegro desired fusion with the new Kingdom the Serbian Government would offer no opposition,M. Pasic&quot; felt confident that the Serbian element comprising 6 millions and more would be well able to hold its own in directing the policy of the new State against the 1,200,000 Croats and 1^000,000 Slovenes.r:&quot;: The Giornale d1 Italia   (Aug. 20th) publishes this interview without comment.     The Corriere della Ssra. which has welcomed and defended against Nationalist attacks the project of a Jugo-Slav-Serbian State proclaimed in the Corfu agreement, seeing in it an important contribution to a political and diplomatic offensive against Austria at a critical moment, is disappointed to find that M. Pasie so soon as he descends from generalities to particulars, shows himself so little inclined to make those compromises without which the desired friend-ship is impossible, and so blind to the unalterable facts - Italy&apos;e necessities and the agreements concluded on -uhe basis of those ne-
XWi - 4 -cessities with her allies.     It is obvious that the rights of the Slav State must be determine by the Great Pov/ers, and Italy1 s po-sition is so strong that sho could afford to await thoir decision tranquilly, desregarding tho proposals of the Serbs and Jugo-Slavs, were it not that a cordial understanding between tho enemies of Mstris is so much in the interest of all of thorn.    For the sake of such anunderstanding Italy is prepared to make any concessions compatible with her essential rights and necessities.    Unless her good-will is net by a greater sense of reality on the part of the Serbs and Jugo-Slava, Italy will be bitterly dioappointed, but she will have nothing to reproach herself with.Between August 20th and September 1st discuaaion of the Ser-bian question was dropped, with the exception of some tentative championing by the nationalists and Clerical Organs of the rights of the Montenegrin dynasty - apparently overridden in the Corfu agree-ment - and abuse of RadovicOn September 1st the Gazzetta del Popolo published an inter-view of Bevione with Supilo, one of the noot influential personalities in the Jugo-Slav movement during tho decade which preceded the war and since then a leader among the Jugo-Slav oxiles,Tho points which Ii, Supilo made cloar were that the assign-ment of Balmatia to Italy in the agreement concluded with Great Bri-tain, France, and Russia in the Spring of 1915 was a result of the veto imposed by the Imperial Russian Government on a union of the Orthodox Serbs with Catholic Croats and Slovenes,The Revolution in Russia had made possible the Corfu agree- -ment. But while Revolutionary Russia had no interest in maintaining 1 the voto, its effects remained embodied in the treaty with Italy.M, Supilo laid great stress on tho necessity for a complete and sincere understanding betweon the new Slav State and Italy for
whichta he said, he and his frfcands   were actively working.     Heexplained at length   the common interest in the weakening and dis-madeBBmberraent of AAstria-Hungary which/ such an understanding essential to the future security of the ^eo States,- and the importance to the Ententes in general of the disintegration of Austria-Hungary as the base of Germany^ Eastern ambitions.He refused to discuss the territorial questions on which Italy and Jugo-Slavism were divided amd suggested that they should be refgBrod to British arbitration.In spite of press efforts   fan article in Le Temps in this sense and one from M. Piohon in Le Petit Journal are welcomed and echoed in the Italian press)   to promote cordial relations between the two countries and&quot; of the good impression produced by M. Poincare&apos;s visit to the Italian front( which, it is said, is shortly to be returned by King Yictor) tension between the French and the Italians in regatd to N. Epirus appears to be increasingly acute.     The Italian amftassa-dor recently, in conversation ysith Lord Robert Cecil, complained of the general attitude of the French towards the Italians, especially in the matter of &quot;the purely Albanian town&quot; of Coritza (where it will be remembered the French proclaimed a Republican regime in December 1916.)    and stated that the evacuation of Epirus by Italian troops was proceeding gradually, but that the French were not withdrawing their forces.     On August 23rd Sir Rennell Rodd reported that the Greek Minister at Rome had suggested that General Sarrail and th e Italian General commanding in Albania should be instructed to devise a plan for the simultanoaas evacuations of Dositiohs in Greek territory.     (Jannina is still occupied by the Italians and Prevesa on the Gulf of Arta by the French)   Sir. R. Rodd, considering it advisable that the plan of evacuation should hi concerted on British initiative, as the French and Italian Military Commanders are so
distrustful that they may not believe each other&apos;s reports, H.M. Government on August 25th instructed the British Ambassadors at Rome and Paris to suggest to the Italian and French Governments that representatives of the protecting Powers at Athens should draw up a plan of evacuation in consultation with the Greek Government.     The proposals appear to be still in suspense, doubts having been expressed by Mr. Craekanthorpe ad to their feasibility in view of the uncora-Ifpomising attitude of tho Italian Minister and his open hostility to the French, and of the fact that he is distrusted by the Greek Government (doubtless on account of bis friendly relations with the late royalist regime.)     Mr. Crackanthorpe thought that he would probably make Italian evacuation conditional on an extension of Italian influence over port control - especially at Patras and Prevesa. French and Italians appear to be at one in resenting the retention by the British of the whole system o  port control after other Allied controls have been abolished.     On the 28th Sir. R. Hodd was instruc-ted to discuss the evacuation question with 3aron Sonnino (Western and General Report of August 29th) Noteg on internal matters.The Nationalist organ supoerted by other interventionist papers is carrying on a regular campaign against the Food Commissioner, Canepa, making full use of the recent riots at Turin, ascribed chiefly to shortage of bread.In reporting Signot Giolitti\a recent speech al Cuneo $mentioned in Weekly Report on Italy of August 31st) the British Ambassador speaks of its &quot;significance&quot;^ coming from a man who never acts without intention and calculation&quot;     He adds that at Novara, where the Deputy Falcione, a former Under Secretary in Giolitti&apos;s Govern-ment, was re-elected, his address was received with cries of &quot;Viva la pace.&apos;&quot;    &quot;Viva Giolitti.&apos;&quot;     &quot;Viva il Socialismoi&quot;   and notes the significance of the $uxta-position.
Evidence of the use which is being made of the Pope&apos;s peace pro-posals to weaken the wai spirit of the people is provided by a fly-sheet issued by a Diocesan Society at Milan containing the text of the proposals with comments Hiose aim apparently is to create odium against unfavourable critics of the Papal action, by representing it as thoroughly democratic and as dealing the coup de grace   to Germany&apos;s perfidious aims which have already failed      Its la-fit paragraph runs as follows:   &quot;The war saved the world and the cfc&amp;se of right, and humiliated Germany.   She is defeated even though she is still too proud to confess it - How Peaoe must come and repair the disasters which the world has suffered&quot;. i
