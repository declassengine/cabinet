1921.WAR . CABINET.AiiERICAN OPINION REGARDING THE-RETENTION OE THE GERMAN SOUTH AFRICA!! COLONIES,I Copy. of&quot; Telegram from Lord Northcliff e. 30th August, ,1917..)No, 228.following is -from isORTHCLIPE? for the War   Cabinet and General SWTS,   Copy to .PHILLIPS;-Reference 70115, opinion of retaining German South African Colonies; following meraorandum is analysis of American opinion regarding retention of same.   It has been made, by HENRY NORTKALL, an Englishman on the Staff of the &quot;New York Wc-iiA&quot;, official organ of the U.S. Government.   He is of sufficient Importance here to he able to communicate with,  correspond with and visit the PRESIDENT.   It was to him I mentioned Colonel HOUSEVS selection who ought to be General (group indecipherable) for visit here.   Beginning during past week .X have quietly sounded number of prominent Americans on the disposition of the German Colonies in  outh Africa.   After talking with Bankers and business men, clergymen, editors and lawyers, labour leaders and plain everyday Americans, I am quite certain any announcement by Great Eritain of her intentions to retain German Colonies would be fiercely resented here..   Very few Americana believe England entered the war out of purely disinterested   altruism, and refusal to discuss surrender South African Colonies would -be pointed to as proof England was.in the war to strengthen herself at the expense of Germany, and that American money and American liv.es ware to be spent in the service of Great Britain. (This is just what IriBh Americans and German Americans and extreme Catholics have been saying right along).   Much as PRESIDENT might sympathise with England!s point of view, I very much doubt if he could stand against wave of public opinion such move would create in this country.   But on the other hand if HOUSE1S excellent suggestion as to sending General SJiliTS is acted upon and he can show our American friends that, with exception of small clique of Prussian officials and military men who rule German Colonies with rod of iron,  the vast majority of real colonials and natives wish, to throw in their lot with those great self-governing democracies building unity South Africa; then any attempt by (word omitted) or her supporters to keep inhabitants under hated rule of Prussia will be just as fiercely resented in America.   Desire of the Colonials and natives for self-government will be hailed in (word omitted? United States) as triumph for democracy and blow to Prussianism,2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 3rd September, 1917,
