IB ^OIMClN^. I&amp;.THE PBCPERTY OF HIS BRITAJK1TT.C^MAJESTY * S OO^iMKT;1 -&quot;:;y&apos;vv:-&quot;v&apos;&apos;:l&apos;-- Cuddesdon,PRIVATE &amp; COCTIDBNTIAL.    - - Wheat ley,Oxo n.My dear Curzon,   - Sept.3rd,1917.I am writing to you as a member of the War Cabinet,&apos; It is most probable that what I am to say will be no news to you: and in that case no harm will be done.   You will simply destroy my,letter.   But it may be otherwise.   The subjeot of my communication is the serious disaffection which appears to exist among the troops, and:which ie supposed to be widespread.   X friend of mine, a sensible and capable, layman, who has &quot;been working for a year with the Y*M.C.A. at the great camp of Shoreham,(Sussex)has just been to see me, full of apprehension of the inoat serious  . kind,&quot; (Another friend, a young officer,: has said: similar things about another place).   The., disaffection. is reported ae growing&apos;rapidly.&apos;   its manifestations in the...,, camp I have spoken of are such&apos;as these - refusal&apos;to work in&apos;the evening without more food - persistent and continuous refusal to sing &quot;God save the King&quot; in church and in concerts - secession at night of a company, out of the camp leaving a placard to say they were going to-imitate the Russian soldiers: and more than&quot; any of these particular incidents, open sedition in speech with a . growing determination.to carry it into action.   This information concerns a.convalescent camp,, where the men are being recovered&apos; for renewed service.   They have suffered and been wounded, and it seems to be resented that they are under a Commandant who has not left the .. country. ............The grounds of objection appear to be (l) Insufficiency of food - especially their having nothing after 4.36 tea: t27 Refusal of leave: the grounds of this are intelligible: but.it iB put upon the absence of sufficient railway -accommodation.   And. the soldiers see constant empty   .,, trains pass along the line, and when they go into Brighton (without a. railway pass by walking four miles and; &apos;bus) they see the orowds. of trippers who have been1 brought by train.   (3): The low rate of pay,&quot;not nearly enough to keep, them in cigarettes9.. ,.;&apos;:,:.   yy other friend from elsewhere spoke of the enormous number of deserters when men%o on leave. - ,I dare say .you&apos;know all thi s,   But I imagine the Off!cere in Command are&apos; not&quot;; willing&apos;;&apos;to- report &quot;such things. &quot;What I would suggest , i s;; that the -War Cabinet should send and make careful enquiry in this particular camp and : at other places.Forgive me if this is all needless.2/Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.Sent^Sth^ Jl91&apos;7^Yours very truly, (sgd)   OXOH.
