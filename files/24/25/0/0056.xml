Copy of a letter from Brigadier General G.S., Olive,head of the British Mission at French General Head Quarters, to the D.K.I.J have just had a long talk with Gen. Eebeney on the future; as I have no doubt his views are those of the C. in C X should like to acquaint you with them-; comingas they do after our, conversation on the subject last Friday *To begin with, he makes no doubt that the Germans are now being very careful of gun ammunition.    There has been a very marked reduction in the last few days,    The 5th Army which generally gets about 3.OOO shells a day is now getting 300.    On&apos; the Moronvillers front there are now only 20 or 30 fired all day* He thinks they have made great increases this year in the number of guns &amp; tubes, and the shells can*t keep pace.    Prisoners confirm the order for economy..He does not think it the least likely that we or the French shall break up the German line this year, although the battle of 1917 is by no means over.    To make a resume of this battle ae far as it has gone * first the French had the big attack, and did moderately, we the smaller attack, and did very well.    In the 2nd stage we have had the big attack and aro doing fairly well, the French smaller operations in which they have done very well.    The 3rd stage will be a few smaller operations^But in all theire the Bosch has suffered; the net result will be first that he will shorten his line again, second, that his force will be a demoralized one in the spring.    The submarines will be less efficient in the winter, owing to stortss &amp; cold water, thus the Germans will have lost the hope of finishing us off that way; the Americans will be shewing some force in the field, the hunger will continue.Consequently he thinks that then we can mount an attack *0 push through, if we prepare it on.twice the front that we have attacked on this year, say 150 kilometres instead of 80. they will be unable to maintain themselves.But the condition is that the Russians must haffg on, oven if thoy are 200 kilometres behind where they are now.
