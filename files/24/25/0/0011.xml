(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)of12Operations .General Barter, Moscow, Russia-.C ,1oG .StWar Office.SEC28.8.17.E T.8.50 p.m.103 M.Yesterday Korniloff arrived:    He had enthusiasticreception from large crowd at station.    He had no representative of Government, to meet him, nor did he visit Kerenski either yesterday or today.     Government having, decided to allow opposition speeches, in opening second session of conference Kerenski called on assembly to give all speakers a courteous and fair hearing as it was the desire of the Government to have the views of all parties..    Korniloff delivered a moderate but earnest speech accurately descriptive of conditions of army and situation at front.    He stated main features of his demand laying especial emphasis on necessity to restore authority of officers.    He demanded also the limitation of soldiers committees to administrative matters .   He drew attention to the output of munitions which had diminished by 60% and to the impossibility of supplying the Army at the front during the winter in the present state of disorganisation *    In conclusion he faced Kerenski and signified that he had no doubt that these measures would be taken.   Kerenski made no sign of protestation Both on entering and on conclusion of his speech Korniloff met with great ovation.     The whole block of soldiers delegates in centre of theatre remained sullenly (? silent) but practically all the civilians in the audience loudly applauded him.     The reception of Kerenski was more noisy but not so solid or universal.   The sullen attitude -of the soldiers delegates was a conspicuous feature of the meeting: they remained ominously quiet when any reference was made to honour of the army or to the necessity for driving out the Germans. Only when their Chief Representative advocated an earlypeace
&apos;    &apos; 2.peace did they applaud.     The assembly generally was evidently painfully affected by this attitude.     Kaledin the Het of the Cossacks declared that the Cossacks had always done their duty at the front and were ready tc dr it in the interior against traitors; he made severe and effective attack against G-overnment5 s inaction.   Rodzianka Miliukoff and Maklakoff representative of Duma and moderate party advocated immediate action and compromise but they showed &quot;disposition to support present government- even in form of dictatorship in order to secure immediate and strong measures and freedom from party politics.     Several influential speakers made violent attack on Tchnoff Minister of Agriculture and accused him of being enemy of Russia.     Tseretelo  incited to class warfare and claimed exclusive power for extreme revolution-ary faction; he was enthusiastically applauded by soldiers delegates.     Korniloff left this afternoon; he told me before departure that a crisis was inevitable unless government took immediate steps demanded by the moderates.     He seems determined. He confidentially informed me that he is to be appointed honorary C-in-C, of the Cossacks at a meeting of Cossacks leaders which is to be held in about 12 days in the Cauoasus. I (? hope) this appointment will have great significance because Korniloff himself and other good authorities have informed me that a conflict between disorganised troops in the Interior and the Cossacks is extremely probable and that the Cossacks would easily cow (? former).Korniloff thanks you for your assurance of continued actionon v/estern front and for explanation regarding General Dessino.He said that very soon this Officer will probably be recalled.
