Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information. AGW/18Weekly Report on-Germany.   XVIII. (4th September, 1917)I. The crisis, for it really was a &quot;crisis&quot; - which arose in the Main Committee of the Reichstag on August 22 over Herr Michaelis1 unsatisfactory attitude towards the Reichstag&apos;s Peace Resolution of July 19 was even more serious than at first appeared. It is noteworthy that the Vorwflrts, the organ of the governmental Socialists, In discussing the proceedings made use of a quotation from a paper (the Deutsche Kriegzeitung) which represented Herr Michaelis as having said in his first statement on August 22 that &quot;he had never stated that he stood uocn the ground of the Peace Resolution of the Majority Parties.He would expound his war-aims at the proper moment, and they would be such as could doubtlessbe realised within the scope of the Resolution&quot;.T^-e VOrwarts had ample opportunity of learning what Michaelis actually did say.     It is the official organ of a scrty which had on the whole been supporting the Government;   and the Majority Socialist leaders in the Reichstag are -robably, as was the case in peace-time, daily in the newspapers.     They certainly continue to write for it, as they did in peace-time.     The Vflrwarts is very honourable, according to newspaper standards, in its present methods of controversy In home politics.     The leaders of the party who were present in the Reichstag Committee would hardly have allowed the above version of Herr Michaelis1 speech to,appear as an unchallenged quotation in their paper unless it has! corres-ponded only too well to what they themselves had heard him say.II. The importance of this point is that it explains theSBCRET. ,.^W
extraordinary &quot;bitterness which the incident has provoked.     This bitterness has been intensified by the behaviour of the press of the fan-Germans end the Conservatives, who now claim Michaelis as. their own and assert that he alternately defies and deceives the.. Majority, a course of which they characteristically approve.     The answer both of the Social Democrats and of the Radicals (progress-ists) is that Michaelis1 subsequent climb-down showed that no Chancellor can now hold pffice for an hour unless he speaks and acts in accordance with the will of the great majority of the Reichstag.III.     Subsequent events lend,colour to the contention of the advanced parties.     For the moment at any rate it looks as if the Reichstag majority had the whiphand of the new Government; although that Government is still bureaugratic in ch-racter.     The moment-is a critical one and the Emperor and his new Chancellor cannot at present afford to quarrel with the Reichstag.     It is true that they - the Emperor and the Chancellor -still holi the reins of power through the bureaucratic Governments of the Empire and of Prussia.     But thoy arc being strictly held to their engagements, and Michaelis has had to reiterate his undertaking to carry out next autumn and winter the Emperor^ promise of a Bill to establish equal, secret and direct suffrage in Prussia.     In the Empire the new deliberative &quot;Free Committee&quot; of leaders of Parties and members of the Federal Council, -the latter, representing the Federated Governments is constitutionally the repository of supreme political power in the Empire - is going to discuss the reply to the ?o-oe&apos;s Note.    This is the first time in the history of the Empire that representatives of .the people have been formally consulted regard-ing diplomatic action before it is taken.     It is pointed out that this procedure ,5ces beyond what is usually done even in
advanced democratic countries.     The ostentatious choice of this .... method is nrobably due both to the internal; situation and to a cdn-stantly manifeoted desire to make out that the policy of the German Emoire is really the expression of the people1 s will - more so in fact that is the &quot;ct-.se in countries which boast of their liberal or democratic institutions.     The adoption of this course is also certainly due to the desire of the Emperor and the Govern-ment to preclude awkward parliamentary criticisms of the reply to the Pope after it has been sentV   :In any case the reply, if dangerous criticism is to be avoided, must be plausibly in accordance with the views of the majority bloc   , All this playing with parliamentarism is, to be sure, gall and wormwood to the Pan-Germans and the Conser-vatives, whose newspapers profess to be unable to believe that Michaelis - as one of them put its &quot;will abandon his initiative and place himself under the tutelage of political parties.&quot;IV.    Whatever may be the ultimate issue of the constitutional struggle there can be no question but that it is being steadily Y maintained and that the Reichstag Majority shows no signs of slacken-ing in its determination.     The majority may contain false as well as real democrats but, if so, both kinds are united in their desire to convince the German masses and also enemy and neutral opinion that things are really moving in Germany.     President Wilson&apos;s answer to the Pope&apos;s Note has come very opportunely for driving the lessons of the democratic crisis home.     The Governmental Socialist paper swallows his homily on democratic Government wholesale and says in effect:&quot;Very true, we must have a Government responsible to the Reichstag which represents the people.     Shall we Germans allow it to be said that negociations could not be opened with us because we are a nation of helots?   Is any of us to go the front with rifle and knapsack and with the thought in his mind that all that would no longer be necessary if
only we adapted ourselves to the forms of Government of the rest of the world?     Let these who hold the fate of the German people in their hands answer according to their consciences]&quot; ^The VorwSrts is a very important organ of opinion just now:Iftchaclis quoted it with approval in his speech to the Main Committee.It is true that the chief organ of the South German Radicals, theFrankfurter Zeitung, writes in a more sedative tone.     Stein, itsBerlin Correspondent, is an old parliamentary hand and has &quot;beennicknamed &quot;the lobby minister Stein.&quot;     Eis chief concern after achange of Chancellors has always been to get into touch with the newmen.     He also has to take into account the mistrust and jealousywith which the bourgeoisie in Germany has al^ys regarded the demo-cratic masses and those parties which inscribe the word &quot;revolution&quot;on their programme.     The Berlin Radical organ, the Tageblatt, takesa much stronger line, because Berlin Radical opinion, perhaps owingto its nearer and more constant observation of the doings of theEmperor and the Junker clique, is more inclined to thorough-goingreforms and to the relentless exercise of political ures?ure.V.     The Reichstag Me jollity as represented in the Main Committee is evidently in favour of steady pressure and out-spoken criticism. The Main Committee last week adopted a resolution backed by Erzberger (Catholic Centre) and Heine &apos;M^jority Socialists) regarding the Press Censorship.     The resolution demands that the powers of the military authorities should be limited in the cese of the Press to cases of the publication of war-news and criticisms of war-news in so far as these might prejudice the conduct of operations in the field.     The discussion of war-aims rnd of constitutional questions must not be subject to the censorship.     The suspension of journals and perioai-cals should only take place if some military enterprise is endangered by what they publish.; and, even when this peril is alleged, the
f) C i\63Ususpension must have the approval of the Chancellor.     The publishersmust be informed of the reason for the contemplated suspension.This resolution has special reference to the recent temporary-suspension of the Frankfurter Zeitung and to the still more recent^suspension of Hardens weekly Die gukunft.     During the discussion, the fact was repea tedly mentioned that difficulties had been placed IJin the way of the circulation of the Frankfurter Zeitung at the frontB-1I while the dissemination of Ban-German   publications was encouraged. I The Catholic (anti-Erzberger) Cologne Volkszeitung had been distri-I bated gratis in some Parts of the front.     There was also a complaint I that the Reichstag and the majority bloc, as well as their War-aimsresolution had been denounced by officers addressing their men on 1 parade.If this damaging kind of criticism continues from day to day and I if it finds a louder echo when the Reichstag meets in full session, I there will be probably further changes in the Governmental system or there will be an explosion of some kind - anintervention of the Emperor or a non-possumus from the Chancellor.     Things will not stop 1 at that.     They are undoubtedly in flux;   and this development must [ ultimately have some influence upon the conduct of the war and upon German war-aims, although the main factor must continue to be military and economic pressure from without.VI.     It remains to be seen -what impression the occupation of Riga will produce, but, on the whole, the situation on the Eastern front seems to bring no comfort whatever to the mass of public opinion in Germany or to the majority in the Reichstag.     It is felt that Germany has no interest in seeing Russia totally disorganised and $ruined.   The economists regard the industrial export trade to Russia and the supplies of food and raw material from Russia as a mainstay of their hopes of a German economic revival after the war.     T^e
official IJorth German gazette is eager to prove that the German offensive on the Eastern front is edlely due to the previous Russian offensive which they attribute to ICerenski under the influence of Russiafs Allies, particularly England.     The German Conservatives &amp;o not relish the idee of the break-up of Russia \ nd the rise of a&apos; number of independent Republics on Germany&apos;s Eastern front.     That woulSjoni&amp;y stir up unrest at home.     Moreover if an Ukrainian Republic for instance were to be in some sort allied with Germany or Austria it might prove a very uncertain ally and might be drawn by economic end other interests back into the orbit of Russian influence.     The advanced parties feel real alarm at the nrospect of further great military enterprises in Russia.     Such enterprises wouftd entail uolitical responsibilities for Russia^ future,  and the responsibilities which Germany has to carryo&amp;ef-are already over-whelming.   There is hardly one word of satisfaction in the German press over any successes on the Erstern front;    it is only Eindenburg and the Emperor who are so out of touuh with public feeling as to dream of making political caoital out of them.711.     It will be interesting to see whether1 Germany answers the Pope&apos;s Hote before England or France or Russia or the three together reply to it.     The Chancellor and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Herr von Ztlhlmann, would doubtless like to be able to criticise the Allies1 reply when they send their own.     It is difficult for them to criticise Mr. Wilson*s reply, as any criticism of his desire for democracy in Germany would put them wrong with important sections of the majority in the Reichstag and with the mass of the oeople.It seems unlikely that the messes or the parliamentary majority will be satisfied with any pretended change of snirit in the Government.     In Germany there is a universal belief in   the
(value of written engagements.   People want to have things in black Lnd white.    This may be unsound from the point of view of. high con-stxtutional theory, but it is the German way.     Ho German will believe that anything has been won for the people until, he sees amendments to the Constitution carried, accepted and promulgated;VIII.     It is impossible to predict what impression the publi-cation of the correspondence between the Kaiser and the Tsar by the Hew York Herald wi 11 produce upon the minds of the Germans.     The Conservatives and Pan-Germans will doubtless approve of it and think that the Kaiser was only carrying out the policy of Bismark and the death-bed injunctions of William I.    On the other hand it may occur to the majority parties that the Kaiser perhaps wants to use. them for I the same ourpose as that for which he advised Nicholas II to use the I Duma - to relieve him of the full responsibility for the calamities which are the result of his policy and that of his advisers. -&apos;-:-/-G.S.
