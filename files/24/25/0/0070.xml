Colonel Jones t ^(This Document is the Property of 399His Britannic Majesty^s Government)1 QRO   l S      BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.i jO J 1^1 &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Report for week ended 5th September, 1917: f/^V^V^-V^: STATISTICAL BRANCH,The monthly agricultural report about to be issued shows that storms have done a good deal of damage in the country and nave hindered the harvest.     The corn crops will all yield below average per acre, barley being the best, and oats the worst. Potatoes and mangolds are both above the average.     The damage to ccrn by the bad weather of August may probably mean a reduction of 2 to 3 per cent, in the crop.Considering the prospects in conjunction with the area under the crops in 1917, wheat and barley should both give a total production greater than last year in England and Wales, but oats will probably be slightly less.    Beans will be much less than in 1916, but peas rather more.    Potatoes will probably be 30 per cent, more than in 1916;    turnips and swedes less, mangolds more;   and hay much less - by over a million tons.&quot; : aBEALL HOLDINGS COLONIES.At the Crown Colony, Patrington, the building of cottages is proceeding.:    Work on the new road and alterations and repairs to existing buildings are also being carried out.    94 men have been employed. * .Harvest is proceeding but operations have been hampered by the wet weather. .At Holbeach 17 pairs of cottages are in course of erection, 21 men being employed. -HORTICULTURE BRANCH.Cases of Wart Disease continue to be reported, but the only outbreak in a new district that has occurred in the past week is one at B ever ley.Arrangements are being made to declare several districts &quot;infected areas&quot; in order to prevent the further spread of disease there.The scheme for securing large supplies of immune varieties of potatoes for planting next season has now been completed, and arrangements will be made very soon to purchase the supplies.     This will assist the administration of the Wart DiseaseOrder. ;,rf::.: :\::-:/\&apos;:&apos;;/V:;.y,:; -yMyFISHERIES DIVISION, i Administrative Sect ion.Support was given to the representations Controller by a Deputation of Steam Trawler owners the supply of cheaper coal for fishing vessels.made to the Coal in favour of
Measures are under consideration for securing control of shell fish heds w$th a view to enabling supplies of shell fish taken in polluted waters to-be purified and made available for human consumption.The powers recently given by the Order of the Pood Controller enabling the Board to declare legal, instruments for fishing which otherwise are&apos; illegal has given rise to a large correspondence and has caused a considerable pressure of work on the small staff available.    The work of the Division being highly technical and responsible it is not possible to cope with it by the usual means of temporary assistance.Permits Section.19 permits have been issued in respect of commercial fishing vessels, and 15 permits for amateur fishing boats.A warning as to artillery praotiae at the entrance to the Blaokwater has been issued to fishermen likely to be in the danger area.Pish Pood Section,Arrangements have been made for dealing with gluts of herrings at Yarmouth and Lowestoft.    The question of the return of soldiers on furlough for the herring season, and to assist in the transport of fish has also received attention.An officer is now at Scarborough making similar arrange-ments for that port.Committees are being organised at the various ports to advise the Fisheries Division regarding applications  toy curers for timber for kipper boxes.Motor^ Loan Section.Applications are coming in steadily and several new applicants have been furnished with suitable engines during the past week.Two vessels have run very successful trials, notably a large lugger fishing out of Brighton, the owner of which is extremely pleased with the way in which the installation has boon done by the   official mechanic.A small &quot;shrimper&quot;     tngined at Lowestoft made a very good run.    Leaving Lowestoft at 10.30 one morning she arrived at Bridlington at 2.30      the next   afternoon after a non-stop run over the distance of more than 120,miles.     This is a vary creditable performance in view of the fact that the skipper is 68 and the mate 67 and the engine had only been installed   two days before the boat started.The very serious increase in the price of petrol and the ever increasing prices of paraffin are the cause of many complaints, from all parti of the ooast.     The Section is already dting its best to insure supplies of fuel for fishing boats but so far it has been unable to do anything to obtain either paraffin or petrol at reduced rates.
ffresh Water Pish Section.Enquiry has been made into complaints of pollution of the Great;Ouse.She Metropolitan Water Board have agreed to allow a number of fish to be taken from their reservoirs for experiment in a new process of smoking and drying fish, which has recently been &quot;brought to the notice of the Section.lishermen* a Registration and Recruiting Section.A scheme im under consideration for tracing and securing men who have hitherto escaped Naval Service.Enquiry forms have been circulated to a considerable number- of men discharged from the Naval Services with a View to securing the return of fishermen to the fisheries.it is hoped to arrange for the seasonal release of fishermen from the Army on lines somewhat analagous to the case of agricultural labourers....&apos; -   -       -; ordnance survey. rDuring the   past week 38,910 maps were sent to France and 2,8*76 to the Admiralty.28 relief models were despatched.diseases oe animals branch, ^ veterinary department. live stock branch.publications. establishment, stc,-:u^-;^The business concerned with Diseases of Animals, the administration of Live Stock and Horse Breeding schemes and other sectional work has proceeded on normal lines as indicated in previous Reports,(for the Seoretary).7th September, 1917.
