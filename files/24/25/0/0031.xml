(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.CRY//020.WEEKLY REPORT OK RUSSIA. XX.*3 September, 1917).After the Moscow Conference.The Moscow Conference has undoubtedly done good, if only because, for the first time since the Revolution, It has brought all classes together.   The result is that in spite of the continuance of class feeling the idea of Russia as a whole has emerged more strongly.    It is to be hoped that the Conference will have a sobering effect both on the Right and on the Left, thereby enabling the Provisional Government to widen the basis of its authority.The two outstanding figures at the Conference were those of Kerenski and Kornilov.     On the eve of the Confex^ence their names had been used by rival parties and attempts had been made to drag Kornilov into political intrigues.    It was probably for this reason that Kerenski asked Kornilov not to speak at Moscow. Although the latter refused on the ground that it was his duty to speak the truth about the army, he refrained from making any attack on the Provisional Government and refused to countenance those politicians who wished to put him f orward as a military dictator.   Kornilov&apos;s speech produced an enormous impression and can only do good.     Prom first to last it was that of a soldier and no one can doubt his sincerity.   By his   conduct at Moscow he has undoubtedly Increased the chances of an agreement between himself and the Provisional Government.   If he had not spoken there would have been cause for suspicion that the Provisional Government was keeping the truth from the nation, and it wouldprobably have weakened the prestige of the Left.
^        It is difficult as yet to speak of the positive results of the Conference, hut on the whole it is likely to strengthen the Government,     Even Milyukov declared at the end of his speech that his party would give their support.   As he spoke after Kornilov one cannot help feeling that the latter gave the cue to the other speakers, and his refusal to countenance any action against the Government nipped in the hud any further movement that might have been impending.    The sharp rebuke given by Kerenski to General Kaledin, the Hetman of the Cossacks, is a proof that the Government was on its guard and was determined to check at the outset any attempts to dictate terms to it.The position before the Conference was that the Left had suffered and the Right gained in prestige as a result of the military failures, and that the Right were prepared to profit by these failures provided they could get the support of the Commander in Chief... It was this which put the C.W.S.D. on the defensive and made It slow to agree to what was demanded of It. The C.W.S.D. are not likely to shake themselves free from the influence of the Maximalists so long as they fear a counter-revolution organised by the Right, and the events of the fortnight preceding the Moscow Conference considerably stiffened their opposition to Kornilov&apos;s demands.     Tsereteli has probably had great difficulty in inducing the C.W.S.D. to see eye to eye with the Government, and the recent refusal of the Petrograd C.W.S.D. to agree to the death sentence shows that he is still fighting an uphill battle in that Assembly.   What will help Tsereteli and the Government is anything that will injure the prestige of the Right.    In these circumstances it seems likely that if, as Reuter reports, the Government has definite proofs of the existence of a counter-revolutionary plot that was being hatched
^etrograxL-du^^ tne Right willreceive a very severe blow, and that many members of the bourgeoisie, especially the Cadets, who mre previously coquetting with the Right,   will hasten to dissociate themselves from those who are found guilty.   It is further reported that the Government does not yet intend to publish the evidence against those engaged in the plot.   This is apparently in order to avoid a crisis of some kind, and to see&apos; if the mere threat is sufficient to detach a large section of the bourgeoisie from the Right and induce them to rally round the Government.    If this is so it is undoubtedly a wise step coming immediately after the Moscow Conference.    What will still further increase the prestige of the Government is an immediate agreement with Kornilov. If Kerenski seizes the present moment for strong action he may gain very strong support.   There may be further military defeats, such as the capture of Riga, but it seems hardly likely that they will injure the position of the Government provided the agreement with Kornilov is already concluded or in a fair way to being concluded.The best hope for the future is that the Provisional &apos; Government should weather the present crisis and should secure stronger support among the bourgeoisie.   Plekhanov&apos;s view that the bourgeoisie ought to include in their programme the minimum demands of the Socialists is an eminently reasonable one, and&apos; would form a very good basis for the formation of a stronger Coalition Government than the present one.It is most important that there should be a better coalition between the different classes before the approach of winter, as there are internal questions which must be dealt with firmly efore the Constituent Assembly can meet.   One of the most Important of these is the industrial question.. The recent Congress
    of Industry and Commerce was not at all satisfactory.Ryabushinski, a leading Moscow merchant, made a very sharp attack on the Government, and was reproached by the moderate Socialists for exhibiting a &quot;narrow and obstinate class-feeling&quot;. Even Plekhanov, who belongs to the extreme Right of the Socialists, condemned the Congress for merely attacking democracy instead of working out a new economic programme. If the Government is to deal with the industrial question it will have to make concessions to labour, while adopting a firm line against the extravagant demands that have been put forward by the workmen.   There are already signs of greater firmness in dealing with the present railvray strike.   No Government can afford to allow a railway strike with the present deplorable condition of transport.   The winter will see the present conditions very much aggravated.    In Petrograd, for example, there is an increasing shortage of fuel and prices are simply soaring.    There will be fresh trouble before the winter unless the Government deals with these questions immediately. Industrial questions are probably even more pressing than the land question, though it is impossible to say how soon that too may become acute.Finland.The situation in Finland is as follows.     The Provisional Government has dissolved the Finnish Diet and has ordered elections for a new one.   The Social Democrats of the old Diet, who have a large majority, refused to recognise the authority of the Russian Government to interfere.   Thereupon Russian troops v/ere sent to occupy the buildings of the Diet in Helsingfors and to prevent any meeting taking place.   It may be
noted that the Russian troops sent to Helsingfors are to a large extent composed of Cossacks who will have no scruples in firing on Finnish Socialists who defy the Russian Government.   Feeling in Russia is now very strong against Finland.   The Finns are accused of following merely their own narrow selfish interests and making no response to the generous sentiments of the Russian Revolution.   The only excuse put forward by the Finns is really no excuse.   They plead that conditions in Russia are so uncertain that they must make provision betimes for their own safety, that a reaction in Russia would mean the annulment of all the rights granted by the present Russian Government.   This is no real excuse for the simple reason that it is the action of the Finns which is helping to imperil the position of the Russian Government, v/hereas if Finnish Socialists had from the first given their generous support the position In Petrograd might have been very much better.Kerenski has always been a friend of Finland and yet since the Revolution he has been bitterly attacked by the Finnish Socialists.   His references to Finland at the Moscow Conference, in which he said that the Provisional Government were determined to exact obedience from the Finns, were applauded on every side. The latest news shows that the Finns are reconsidering their decision to resist the Russian Government.   The chief danger at present is that of a German landing on the Finnish coast, which will be possible until the end of September.     This might encourage the Finns and a conflict with the Russians would then be unavoidable. On the other hand, the Finns are likely to yield to a determined attitude on the part of the Provisional Government, especially as their food prospects are very far from bright without help from Russia.*&apos; RAL3.9.17.
