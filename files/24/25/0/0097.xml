mQ.T. 1996/WAH CABINET. ;.        ffftALB ABKIAL WARSHIP * (Copy of letter from &amp;r. J. JJeale to the Secretary, War Cabinet.)Vintilla, .     Oxshott.7th September, 1917.Sir,-;.In March, 1917, the War Cabinet had before them par-ticular3 of the Nealc Aerial Warship, together with the results of tweive months experimental work as carried out by the Nealc Aerial Warship Advisory Comiiiitt.ee which was constituted, in April, 1916, by Mr. Lloyd George,.. when Minister of Munitions with the object of determining the value of this invention for the purposes of War and of Peace.   .The War Cabinet consulted the First Lord of the Admiral-ty and the Admiralty Airship Experts with the result that a Minute wa-T sent by the War Cabinet to the Minister of Munitions statins that the ship should not be builS during the war.   .The Admiralty oriticisms are contained in a letter to me from: the Chairman of the Neale Aerial Warship.Advisory Committee dated 13th March, 1^17, a copy of which is attached. These criticisms may be stated under three heads..&apos;-: -1V The vulnerability, of the ship from aeroplane attack.2. The labour and material difficulty/3* The question of management&apos;of the ship and 3hed. .. After the War Cabinet&apos;s Minute had been received by the Minister of Munitions. I was instructed to: take up the matter, with the Admiralty, and to reply to the War Cabinet Minute, which I now have the honour to do.-f VI trust that you will read this reply to the Wari Cabinet with a view to ascertaining whether they consider the j&apos;i matter now justifies their reconsideration.1. The vulnerability of the ship from aeroplane attack.In order to meet this criticism I have amended toy design by providing an aeroplane landing stage on the roof of the ship from which aeroplanes can arrive or depart whilst the ship is in motion.Inside the roof of the s!:ip, 40 Chaser aeroplanes are carried, together with the necessary pilots.When a hostile aeroplane attack on the ship appears imminent, the requisite number of these Chaser aeroplane8(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KjS BftITAK?TIC MAJgfigyS OOVBKME&amp;Tl
emerge and .attack the hostile aircraft &quot;before it comes within machine-gun range of tho ship.Wen the chip is at a high altitude,  say 20.000 feet, it will be impossible for any hostile, aircraft to approach within machine-gun range on account of. the time required &quot;by the;aeroplane to mount to this altitude V  The attacking aero-: planes will be at;a further disadvantage owing to being   :. heavily &quot;burdened whilst the defending aeroplanes are short range machines, light and very fast.Thia;method of defence presents no great engineering difficulty and is an effective answer to this criticism.-  2. The labour and material difficulty/: /. - .This difficulty can be overcome by building the first airship in the United States of-America or in Canada where from personal:experience I know the conditions to be favourable, the materials are available on the spot and the labour can be obtained from Japan.;&apos; 3. The Question of the management of the ship and shed. .-,In this criticism is also included a question of time occupied;in building.In order to deal with the time; element of this criticism the Chairman of the EYA/W. Committee; instructed me to place the design and drawings of the&apos;&apos;H^A.^&apos;^ Shed;before a leading constructional engineer/ who in a most exhaustive report, makes the following statement- - &quot;If only 1,000 efficient men could be obtainable the bulk of the work might therefore be erected - in 500 single shifts or within 3 months, but probably 3uch men would not be obtainable and the bulk of the erection would ; take 6 months.&quot;   He further adds - &quot;Though perhaps outside my province, it occurs to me that the cost of each of the 3 units -Airship,&apos; Shed,  or Shops - is after all approximate to the cost of the War for a few hours, if,  therefore, there is a 1 .:: to 8 chance; that theowhole outfit:would: shorten/the War by only one day, ;it ought to be tried and, if it is to be tried, the organisation and establishment should start without-delay.&quot;With regard to the management,  this refers chiefly to the docking of the ship. ;&quot;;^, .;gV;:G;^ &quot;I: admit tho operation of docking presents a difficulty, but\1: would:point out that ;the fundamental difference between :the Nealc;Aerial Warship and all:other;types of airships lies in the fact that whereas the latter types have to be docked after each short trip, this Airship is de si gned to remain in the air for months at a tiitio, she can dock in weather of her -own selection,  and conscquently the probability of damage at re-docking;is reduced to an almost negligible quantity.So long as the ..ship; is. in. the air she will be perffeebly safe but some risk of damage during, docking.Certainly exists and it is a risk which must be;;borne. )&apos; ;.; - V    &quot;T/ithftrrther reference to the time&apos; occupied in building i woula mention that..when i submitted my invention to the Admiralty in August, 1914. : the day after the declaration: of War, this identical criticism, that the ship could not be built in time to bo of service,.- was raised.   To again-raise it after three ye?.\rs of war and at a time when no ma,n can fore-see the ena, would appear improvident.
I would ask the War Cabinet not to consider the N.A.W., in the light of an untried experiment.   When I first brought the invention to the notice of Mr. Lloyd George there were a great number of points in the design which were untried and unproved and it was to try and prove these points that the Committee was formed and some hundreds of tests and experiments conducted.Recently a Treasury Grant of  16,000 bias been awarded for the purposes of conducting further experiments but although these further experiments would, in peace time, be very instructive and of great value, I maintain they are relatively unimportant experiments and will not affect the utility or the success of the ship as a whole.1^he experiments and tests which were,necessary to prove contentions on the main points of the design have ^been com-pletely^successful, and the Chairman of the^N7A.W. Advisory Com&quot; mittee in his final report recommends that &quot;work should be&quot; com-menced on the construction of the, airship shed, the-^main girders for the airship, and the preparation of a land&apos;station, in order ihat no time may be lost by the completion of the suggested  &quot;**&quot;&quot;&quot;experiments, and an airship of these large dimensions and con-sequent power placed at the disposal of the nation.&quot;i therefore submit that this recommendation be adopted, in the full and confident knowledge that it will result in a more speedy cessation of hostilities.It is generally conceded that the present naval and military position is in the nature of a deadlock and that any ultimate decision must be reached through the air.This is primarily a War of Invention.Organisation, Men and Material are essential but must give way to Invention all along the line.Having come to the conclusion that the issue will be decided in the Ai*\ it appears therathod to be adopted is to swamp the enemy by means of an enormous Aeroplane production.This solution of the crisis is crude, shews lack of initiative, and is one at which both sides can play.The British, of all the peoples, possess the greatest inventive capacity and, at the same time, the most defective machinery for converting this great national asset to the common good. -   -.  ,Successive Governments have signally failed to deal with this deficiency, the result being that, in peace, our Commerce has suffered, and in War, after three years, we are unable to do justice to the bravery and tenacity of the nation.Here is a case of an invention of an engine of War of powerful offensive capabilities and vast range of action, which was considered, on the face of it, to justify the appointment of a Committee of Investigation.
The Committee sit for a year - conduct numerous tests and experiments proving tbe inventor?s contentions to be correct and finally they -recommend that the invention, the N.A.W. shall be built. - Yet the work ie.;;not:.proceeded with, for reasons that.were known and operative before the Committee was formed, and which are,, moreover, even now surmountableIf we are to rely on future American production to provide the balance of aeroplanes necessary to force a decision., the question of time, transport and money enter into the problem to an even greater extent than they do in the case of the building of the N.A.W.Although the Admiralty experts admit that theN.A.W. would be useful for long scounting expeditions, the ship was not designed to serve as an auxiliary arm to the Navy but for the purpose of forming a nucleus of ah independent aerial fleet of great offens1/ e : capabilities.It should part i cularly be no ted that this air-shi p does not drop bombs, but aim specially designed 15&quot; H.E. shells constructed of aluminium, wire-wound to provide the necessary containing strength, and fired from pneumatic guns. ..To aim from great altitudes only requires sufficient initial velocity to overcome the speed of the ship and to create a slight trajectory; Gravity,- a non-variable force, does the rest.One N.A.W. carrying 150 tons of 15&quot; shells, bombarding the Naval and Military works of the enemy and protected by her scre&amp;n cf 40 Chaser aeroplanes might conceivably have an effect cr. -the-ultimate issue of the War.     The knowledge that we could, and would, xui^d dozens of this type of ship would probably bring about the final decision. \One N.A.W. permanently stationed over London would render aeroplane raids by; day or night a physical -impossibility.   No., raiders .: could stand against 40 Chaser aeroplanes permanently:stationed at an altitude of 20,000 feet, Entirely apart from the.: psychological effect produced on the enemy pilots by the lack: of knowledge of our exact whereabouts.The N.A.W. whether Stationary or cruising is silent on account .   of the Petrol Electric Drive.     The Captain of the Ship isconsequently enabled to hes?r the approach and locate the d-jrecticivof hostile raiders, entirely apart from \ any previous ; wireless; warning---It is not my desire U in the abov  remarks, to attempt to discourage the production o,!f aeroplanes. ;The relative functions of aeroplanle and airship do not in any way clash or over-lap, nor&apos; Indeed, have they much in common. Both are essential, but whilst Mfe have the aeroplane we have not the airship.It is possible, with/a free hand/&apos; to have a ship in the air within twelve months.       -; / i
I would, therefore submit, for the War Cabinet decision; that instructions be given me to proceed, immediately to America and commence the.building of a ship.The total cost of one ship would be under  1,000,000 the total cost of 6 ships   ,500,000.AERIAL Comlaeaqial, TgAJSrQltT.Although the Aerial -Transport possibilities of the fleale Airship do not; immediately comewithin-the scope of.my^ reply to the\:War Cabinet Minute they have an indirect bearing on&quot;the desirability of having the airship built before the oessat ion of - hostilities. ^  c&apos;s:Ch^-It is generally conceded that Aerial Transport after the war is a problsm which will have to be faced and whilst aeroplanes are suitable - for the transport of mail: and for :.: the conveyance of pas s enters In small.numoers it;, is to &apos; the,: airship:,:., that: we: must:: look for th e s olut ion o f the; main or obi em.It must he as obvious to the layman as to the aeronautical.;&apos;-.enk,3,n&apos;e8r thst to .push merchandise1 through the air. wlllv; eventually, become&apos; economical than through the more ponderable medium&apos;of water, but to achieve efficiency and economy in the operation will entail much es^r^ewnftiu work and practical experience.&quot;&apos; I submit, that it is therefore desirable that thiswork should be put in hand immediately as considerable time must.:; el apse - before the -desired degree of eff icieney, and economical running is obtained.-In: vie?; of the inevitable shortage of. shipping- I .  -would point out&quot;that airship-construction presents: a: much more rapid means ;of:filling the gap than does the construction of:. marine ships.&apos; here is little doubt Germany is saving up. her&apos; fleet/..). of airships for-the:purposes ox commercial; expanse after the war but even the letest ::eppeiin has free ^lift of only 10 tons., as against the 150 tons free lift of the smallest design of the Ueale Airship. .One of the in&amp;ny benefits that the 77ar has conferred upon us is the degree of-perfection to which we hsve had to bring: aeroplane design and--construction.   If the war, in a like manner; compels the Government: to Coring- airship., construction to -an equivalent etage-of efficiency, so that this nation not only equals other nations in;matters: aerial but obtainsC&amp; preponde-CC rating supremacy, a further great.advantage will have&apos;been conferred Upon U8, -:-.:/\\-&apos;- / -   .-.   &apos; V/.-V;&apos;-/;therefore in addition to the previously mentioned f easons why a ^.A.T-.. would be immediately constructed I urge that from the desirability of solving the problem of aerial transport after the war no further time should be lost in putting a shin in hand. &apos;- * -
SUBSIBISED AERIAL NAVY.It would appear desirable that airshipsconstructed by private firms after the war should besubsidised by the Government so as to form a basis of an Aerial Navy.It will be found that commercial airships lend themselves much more readily to conversion into fighting ships than do the mercantile marine of the present day and to this end they should be standardised.This standardisation of commercial airships built by private firms will be the more readily accomplished if the Government take the initiative: by building the first experimental 3hips thus obtaining the:requisite; knowledge to enable the standardisod design to be prepared so that private construction can be carried but under the authority and supervision of the Air Minister.sjime organisation of this character be not constitUTOoiiaiSiB will after the war commence building all sizes; arid shapes of airships the majority of which will be useless to the Government should necessity arise.With a properly, standardised aerial force atthe Government *s command comprised of units of far greaterefficiency than those possessed by other nations it mightconceivably be possible in a case of internationalcomplication to bring such an overwhelming aerial forceto bear as to ensure that the spirit of compromise prevail.I am, Sir.Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   JOHSf KEALE.
f.   N C L 0 S tT R.8.. KEALE   AERIAL   WARSHIP.A letter from Sir Arthur :Duckh^^ /fr.A.W. Advisory CoWitsee to Mr. Heale--:-&apos;(the inventor -of A.W. )7&quot;&quot;itaFing result of^meetlr^ Sir Arthur Itookham&quot;&apos;-,. as Chairman of &quot;the Ij^AJf. Advl&quot; s oVy^Commitiee, and Sir &apos;;&apos;. Idward Carson, flirafiord of the.-:ldmTfalty, and Tech-ni^al Representatives *o:f the Admiralty on the 13th MARCH. 1917;MINISTRY   OF   LTI17ITIONS   OP   WAR.WHITEHALL PLACE, S.W.Dear Heale, 13th March, 1917,Sir Edward Carson to-day.asked me to visit the Admiralty as the Prime Minister had put up to him the question whether the building of the 2&apos;eale Airship at thepresent time was feasible and desirable,He had a copy of my report before him and I put my opinion in words in the same form as I had previously done in writing..The Admiralty representatives acknowledge that a ship of these dimensions would be useful for long scouting expeditions, but they conuider for journeys over the North Sea or over Germany, the certainty of destruction of the ship by aeroplane attack was so great that it was not a possible proposition for this purpose.   They also consider that raiders in the near future will be provided with aeroplanes and they consider that the ship would not be safe even at high altitudes over the Atlantic, this point of view I discounted The main questions are: -(1) The amount of men and material that would be required for the construction of the ship.(2) Whet her the Shed and Ship would be manage able.Dealing with (1) I had no figures with me as to the quantity of wood required but there is a very      great shortage of Wood at the present time and the Admiralty stated that there is not enough timber in the Country to carry cut the construction of the ahed as designed.   They further stated that the length of time it would take to build the ship would be at least 18 months as it has taken them over a year under the best conditions to build one of their ordinary sheds and it would undoubtedly take longer to build the timber shed and raft on a sheet of   water.They further made a point that at the present time they are very short of labour for the ships they have, in hand, and they consider any surplus labour at the present time should b.e devoted to the completion of these ships rather than to a new one.They also stated that the present supply of fabric both for the balloonets and the outside covering was not sufficient for their existing ships and that the demand for the locale Airship would be so great that it could not be met,I could not refute these statements as I had no figures, either as to the quantity of timber etc,, required or any particulaara based on a careful estimate as to the number of men that could be employed and the length of time it would take them to construct the ship.   These I had asked you to get and I should be glad to receive
them as it will be on these  figures that any decision as to what further shall be done with the ship.The Chief Constructor of the tfavy who was present raised the question of the manoeuvring of the ship in and out of the shed, this is a problem of very considerable magnitude I own, but I do not think unsurmount able, but I do not consider we have considered it sufficiently.The First Lord and the other gentlemen present agreed that experiments should go forward and that one or more bays should be built with balloonets inside them in order to test   ; the effect of the surging of the gas bags etc.k : I would ask you- to let me have the fullest particulars as to labour and material   etc,, and also for a proposition as to what steps you would suggest for an experiment on say, two or three bays of the airship,I suppose the next step will oome from the Prime idni st er in a 1 et t er to you or the Compt roll er or my self stating his views in the matter, and we must have the figures ready in order to be able to put up a case.   -;(Sgd)       A M.
