SECRET.SUPPLY  OF STEEL PLATES TO  ITALY.Dear Mr. Churchill, London, August 24, 1917.YOU asked me, at our interview yesterday afternoon, to let you have a note confirming therepresentations I made to you with regard to the 40,000 tons of platesIn August 1916 Mr. Runciman met certain Italian Ministers at Pallanza, when the importance was urged of facilitating the construction of merchant vessels in Italian shipyards. It. was pointed out that these yards had labour available but were in need of material. Mrv Runciman accordingly undertook to recommend, on his return to London, the supply of 35,000 tons of material.In October last I personally saw Mr. Montagu, then Minister of Munitions, and received from him; an undertaking that, in spite of the serious shortage of steel and the great and urgent demands on the limited stocks available in this country, and also in view of the political importance which the British Government realised was involved in the supply of this material, 40,000 tons of steel for the construction of twelve vessels would be supplied during 1917; in twelve equal monthly instalments.This undertaking was confirmed in a note which I received from Mr. Montagu, a copy of which I enclose for your information.Moreover, at the.Inter-Allied Naval Conference, held in London in January last, note was taken of this arrangement.Up to date, approximately 22,000 tons have been supplied. I have recently learnt, however, that the War Cabinet have decided that further supplies of this material have been temporarily suspended.I am loath to believe that, in arriving at such a decision, the War Cabinet can. have realised the circumstances of the case, and that -a pledge had been given personally to me by the then Minister of Munitions for the supply of this steel.I deem it my duty, therefore, to lay these facts; before you, and would ask you to be good enough to bring thorn to the notice of the Cabinet in order that the question may be reconsidered. I am sure that I need, scarcely point out that, apart from the deplorable moral effect which such a decision will have in Italy, where it must of necessity become widely known in view of the fact that the vessels for which the steel is required are being constructed in shipyards.situated at different Italian ports, from a practical point of view also the cessation of the supply, even if only temporary, is uneconomic, since it will result in the delay of the completion of vessels of which my country stands in such dire need, and which will afford a certain relief in the present general scarcity of tonnage.I have not reported to my Government the decision of the War Cabinet, since it has not been conveyed to me officially, and I trust that when the foregoing facts are fully realised the matter may be reconsidered.As, however, the delay must shortly become known in Italy, I hope that I may rely on you to let me have a favourable answer at an early date.With best thanks in advance, I remain, dear Mr. Churchill,Yours sincerely,IMPERIALI.[935-1]
[Enclosure.]Copy of Note from Mr. Montagu, dated October 31, 1916.Mr. Montagu saw the Marquis Imperiali to-day, and Sir E. Wyldbore Smith andMr. Barlow were also present.On the requirement for steel for shipbuilding, Mr. Montagu said that after consultation with the Board of Trade he agreed to arrange that the steel for ship-building asked for by the Italian Government to a total of 40,000 tons. shall be despatched from Great Britain in twelve equal inorTthly instalments, beginning in January 1917.Details as to the specifications and as to the quantities of each kind of steel to be included in each consignment will be arranged between Signor De Meo aud the Ministry of. Munitions. Mr. Montagu further promised that he would do his utmost to speed up the delivery during the second Half of 1917 with a view to earlier completion of the whole order.. He explained that the British Government had consented to give this steel, on grounds, ofinternational politics, although they, are themselves already short of steel for.their own national needs, and will be shorter still in consequence of thisconcession.,       ;::%:;r .....     .v;,&apos;::.- [i. ^The Italian Ambassador expressed great gratitude for this promise&apos;...   ,...    . ,..As to the requirement for shell steel, the Minister said that, representatives of the French, British, and Italian Governments in New York are conferring with Messrs. Morgan as to tlie possibility of meeting the Italian requirements&apos;.As to the.requirement for brass^he. explained that it was impossible to obtain brass rod of the specification laid down by the Italian Government. They must therefore choose between taking Brass of the kind used by Great Britain or going without..      .. , .... :Sir E. Wyldbore Smith said, that the point as.to pig-iron had been settled.Mr. Montagu assured tlie..Marquis Imperiali that he was anxious to do everything possible to meet Italian requirements&apos;.IT.
