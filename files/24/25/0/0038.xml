Colonel Jones10onertv of228/This Document *sSECRET.His Britannic (Vtaj:Government.)Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BP\//015.Weekly Report on Poland. XV.4-thSeptember, 1917.)I.     The Resignation of trie Council of State.The surviving &quot;rump1&apos; of the Polish Provisional Council of State has resigned in a body - according to the most trustworthy-account &quot;because the Legions were sent to the front without the Council being consulted&quot;.About the middle of July an enormous majority of the Russian Poles serving in the Legions had withdrawn from them by refusing to take the prescribed oath.     It was obvious that also among the Austrian Poles Pilsudski and the Radical-Socialist Left had a very considerable following and that unrest in the Legions would not end until these men, or at least their leaders, were removed. If the Legions were to become the cadres of a &quot;well-disciplined&quot; conscript army it was necessary to weed out in time the revolution-aries, especially as these, being Pilsudski&apos;s oldest associates, were filling some of the most important commands.     But the removal or resignation of the most popular commanders only increased the ferment in the Legions and, as a consequence, considerable numbers of Austrian Poles in the different regiments asked to be trans-ferred to the Austro-Kungarian army, not wishing to remain in a formation which they could no longer acknowledge as a Polish national army.     In the first half of August this demand was made in a body by the entire 1st, and then also hy the 5th infantry and the 1st cavalry regiment (i.e. by &quot;what had been Pilsudski !s own brigade).     By an order dated August 14 the Chief Commander of the
&amp; 2 BLegions granted the request of the 1st infantry regiment.     Here our more detailed information breaks off and we can merely guess much of what followed.     The movement v/as obviously spreading and threatening the legions with complete annihilation.   . Governor-General von Beseler must have thought that the best way to put an end to &quot;politics&quot; in the Legions would be to send them to the front at once.     &quot;In view cf the general offensive by our enemies,&quot; ex-plains a Vienna telegram of August 31, &quot;the Austro-Hungarian and German governments have decided to utilise the Polish auxiliary corps under Austrian command.     As soon as the war situation permits, the corps will again form the nucleus of the Polish army.&quot;Since April 10, 1917, when the Legions were assigned to the polish State, they had ceased to be called &quot;the Polish auxiliary corps&quot; and to be subject to the Austrian army command.     On -July 15 the Polish Provisional Council of State declared in a series of resolutions that it was &quot;for the Polish army the supreme political authority&quot;; that &quot;the Polish army cannot be use! at the front-without the consent of the Ccuncil of State&quot; and that &quot;the Legionswill be used at present ...... exclusively as cadres for the Polisharmy&quot;.     Thus by ordering the Legions to the frcnt the Central Powers have flaunted the declarations of the Council of July 15 and gone back on the Act cf April 10.     This v/as too much even for the &quot;conciliatories&quot;, who had remained in the Council, and they resigned in a body.     But even that they proved themselves unable to do effectively in the absence of the gingering influence of the revolutionary Left - cosi 2e fene natura.     They appointed a committee to carry on the business of the polish State, and especially to supervise the administration sf justice and education. Instead of. provoking an acute crisis they have taken precautions that the disappearance of the Council of State should not leave too aching a void either for the Central Powers or for the Inter-Party Union (the organisation of the National Democrats and Realists
which expects, or expected, to gain the first places in the new Polish government).     By their well-meaning attempt to preserve for the Polish nation what they fondly &apos; imagined to he most valuable assets they seem likely to have enabled their opponents to continue at leisure a dubious game.. II.     The Congress of the Parties of the &quot;Right&quot; at Moscow. Early this summer 11. Lednicki, the most prominent Polish leader in Russia, who is now the official adviser to the Russian government on Polish matters, tried to bring about a general under-standing of all the Polish political parties in Russia, but failed. Having broken off the negotiations, the leaders of the Right (the National Democrats and Realists) summoned a &quot;Hational Congress&quot; to meet at Moscow on July 21 and drew up a scheme of representation which would have created for them an artificial majority at the Congress.     The Polish Democrats (the party of M. Lednicki) as well as the Socialist Left refused to have anything to do with the Moscow &quot;Congress&quot; which cannot consequently be described as any-thing more than a party conference of the Right, and which, so far from contributing to the political consolidation of Polish opinion in Russia, tends merely to increase and to embitter party differences.Most of the general political resolutions passed by the Con-gress are such as any honest Pole-..would accept; the Congress en-dorsed the Cracow resolutions of May 28 in favour of a re-united, independent Poland with access to the sea,declared against Germany and in favour of a victory cf the Entente which would gain the power of self-determination for the subject nationalities of the Central Powers, etc..     But then it procesdad to demand once more that the Poles who serve in the Russian army should be formed into a separate Polish army, although Polish opinion is very much
divided on that point,     and in spite of M. Kerenski*s declaration that such a breaking-up of the Russian army is inadmissible and would be dangerous from the point of view of Russia.     &quot;In view of the difficulties which the Russian government puts in the way of an independent Polish army, the Congress declares that such an attitude may shake the faith of the Polish nation in the sincerity of the Proclamation mad^ by the Russian Provisionalgovernment on March 17, 1917 j-O.S.)*MBy this Proclamation the Russian government recognised the independence of Poland within the territories where the Poles form a majority/    But H. Lmowski, whom the Congress of the Right acknowledges as its London representative, demands from Russia another 100,000 square miles of territory with a population of at least 12,000,000 among whom the Lithuanians, White Russians and Little Russians form an overwhelming majority.     Katuially no such demands were made in,yerbis at the Congress, or, even in spite of the license which now seems to prevail in Russia, they might have brought some persons present to gaol; but there are clear indica-tions that the idea of such an &quot;extension to the east&quot; was in peoplefs minds.     Those claims aiming at the dismemberment of Russia are not the only reason for Russian opposition to a separate Polish army.^   But yet one wonders how this same Congress dared to attribute bad faitji to the Russian government merely bedause it does not propose to put an army at the disposal of those very men who threaten Russia with greater losses of territory than have probably ever been considered by her avowed enemies, the Central Powers.     This discord in relation to Russia and the hardly(1)   A wire sent to the Foreign Office on June 21, 1917, by the Oliief of the Press Bureau cf the Polish National Committee at Petrograd (the organisation of the Right) stated that the resolu-tion in favour of a Polish army had been passed at the Polish Army Conference&quot;by a majority of 238 to 8 with 25 abstentions&apos;! But the fact was not mentjoned that 90 delegates had previously withdrawn from the Conference a.s a protest against the latter assuming the right to decide these mattersJ
disguised wish te play off the Western Powers against Russia takes away much of the pleasure which might otherwise have-been felt at the absolutely unimpeachable attitude of the Congress with regard to the Western States of the Entente. III.     Galician Affairs*In the new Austrian Cabinet m. Cwiklinski, a Pole, has been confirmed as Minister of Education and M. Twardowski, another Pole, as Minister for Galicia.     M. Eorbaczewski, an Ukrainian, has been appointed minister without portfolio, obviously to represent his nationality in the Cabinet.     The Ukrainians, whose numbers in Austria are almost equal to those of the Poles, have of course an excellent claim to be represented in the Cabinet, but the Poles have always violently opposed it, and to our knowledge 4p to now there never has been an Ukrainian Cabinet Minister in Austria.    Tho appointment of Horhacz-e^eki may therefore be the answer of the Austrian government to the Poles for their uncertain attitude towards it, and an interesting situation is likely to develop.      It is also a further proof of the Ukrainian schemes having been resumed by Austria, and is no doubt in some way connected with Archbishop Szeptycki&apos;s intrigues in Switzerland.L.B.N.4/9/17.
