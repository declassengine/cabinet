-Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.Memorandum onThe Hew German-Swise Cemmercial and Financial Agreement(6th September. 1917.)The situat ion out of which the new Commercial and Pinancial Agreement between Germany and Switzerland arose was as follows. Switzerland needs coal for her industries and for domestic purposes and Germany is the only country from which, under present conditions, this need can be supplied.    Germany finds great difficulty in extracting any coal or transporting it abroad owing to lack of lahour and lack of rolling stock and in consequence of the coal necessities of her great cities and industries.    These difficulties she is trying to overcome.    But another very serious difficulty le that Germany finds almost insuperable difficulty in balancing indispensable imports from Switzerland by remittances to that country in view of the rate of exchange.    Her aim is that no new prejudice to the foreign exchange should arise out of these transact!una,i.e;. that the exchange of goods, should be settled in auch a manner that the values of import and export should as far as possible balance each other for the duration of the new commercial treaty either by fixing prices or by other meaaurea.     In the latter case it is a question of granting credits. Germany has ascertained the value cf her average imports from Switzerland.    Te balance this sum was her chief object in the Swiss negotiations.There were two ways of attempting this.     The price of German exports - especially that of the most important German export, ooal
oula be fixed near enough to the general price prevailing in neighbouring countries to enable a balance to be effected.    This tfould have meant, however   an increase of at least 60 francs per ton, and Switzerland shrank from paying this price :n account of the condition of her industries and the demands which the in-creased cost of living is already making upon her population. Germany on the other hand could not afford the other way, i.e. to finance all her imports from Switzerland on credit.    A cam-promise was devised.    The price of coal is to be raised by about 50 per cent and the balance of the financing will be obtained by credits.    Twenty million francs ( 800,000) per month or 180.000,000 ( 7,200,000) for the duration of the new agreement (nine months) represent the credit for the excess of the imports of Germany from Switzerland.    Switzerland is to give Germany credit to this amount monthly with a rate of interest at 6 per cent per annum.&quot;The Swiss Coal Zentrale&quot; (Central-Coal Association at Bale for giving Swiss importers permits to receive German coal) is being converted into a Limited Liability Company.     The share-holders will consist of all the firms who receive a permit for their coal imports from the Swiss Coal Zentrale, in accordance with the former agreement with Germany.     All importers of German coal require such a permit, unless they are engaged in war industries fer German account, in which case they are supplied by Germany direct.    The permits for import were granted on the condition that the re-sale of coal was only for Swiss consumption, and that those establishments which were working for the Entente Powers were to .be excluded.The firms which import through the Zentrale have now to help to finance the credit to Germany, and this is to be done in the blowing manner.    They will not only have to pay the agreed price to the German exporters, but they will also have to make
with the Zentrale a deposit for a certain amount upon each wagon tf coal which they receive. *   In other words, the price of coal is to he fixed at 90 francs per ton instead of the present price of 60 francs.    A similar arrangement is to he made regarding iron from Germany, the price of which is to he increased on an average by 200 francs per ton.     A credit will be granted to Germany, as stated above, and it is to be based upon the constancy of the supply of coal.     A supply of 200,000 tons per month is contemplated, and so long as that figure is reached the advance te Germany is to be twenty million francs ( 800,000).     The first 74,000 tons of coal, however, are to be independent of any advance and are to be balanced by a supply of electric power to Germany by Switzerland.(probably from the electric power works at Rheinfelden, where the Rhine forms the frontier withAD&amp;ioft).    The agreement is for nine months, terminable at any time by either side on two months1 notice.     Thus the total contemplated advance is, as already stated, 180,000,000 francs ( 7,200,000).This 6 per cent lean is to be secured by German debentures (Pfandbriefe).     The Swiss Ceal Zentrale will be converted inta a Limited Liability Company with 60,000 shares of 500 francs each; They will be in two series, A. and B., and series A. is to be taken over by a syndicate of Swiss banking institutions and by the cantonal banks.     In series Bv all the importers of coal through the Sentrale have to participate, and they will take over one share of 500 francs for every five tons of coal supplied to them.     The company is to have the right to issue notes with a currency of several years to the extent of their share capital.?As regards-Swiss exports to Germany, the supply which is to be guaranteed by the agreement is considerably reduced as compared with last yearfs agreement, especially in respect of cattle.    There nad been considerable criticism in Switzerland cf the extent to which cattle were being exported to Germany, and it was alleged that
G.S.6/9/17.SwiBS stocks were being dangerously reduced.     On the other hand there were replies tv this criticism to the effect that the stock of cattle in Switzerland was actually increasing notwithstanding the exports to Germany.It is noteworthy that the Mortgage Bank of Bale has succeeded in obtaining a guarantee from a syndicate of Bale banking in-stitutes for the repayment of loans lent on mortgage in marks in Germany.    The repayment is guaranteed by this syndicate at the rate of 123-I francs-for 100 marks.   Perhaps this might be inter-preted as a remarkable proof of S\viss confidence in the recovery of Germany aft or the war.    The present rate of exchange is down at 65 francs or thereabouts for 100 marks.    According to the last report the Bale Mortgage Bank had mortgages outstanding te the extent of about 73,000,000 francs (some  2,900,000), of which 37.33 millions ( 1.490,000) were lent in Germany.     That is ta say, more than half of the bank&apos;s whale loans are placed in Germany -a very large amount in proportion to the share dap it al which is 7.8 million francs and the reserves which are 2.6 millions.   The share capital and the reserves thus represent only about 25 per cent ef the advances made by the bank in Germany.The guaranteeing yf these loans by a -syndicate of Bale banking institutes may, however, simply mean that in the present critical state of affairs the Swiss banks are unwilling to allow any financial institute of considerable importance to get into a position of difficulty.     It has, I believe, been stated that there hao been a run upon the Bale Mortgage Bank.
