7, The 22nd neeting of the Joint Committee onInstitutional Treafaent in England and Vales tf&amp;s held On the 15th instant.     The report, a copy of fhieh is annexed as Appendix XV deals with proposals for the utilisation of a number of buildings for tfeurastheniei-and Epilepsy and oontains an Outline of a scheme for out-patient olinics in London for the treatment cf neurasthenic cases *hich has been proposed by Sir John Collie, and which, if successful, will be capable of extension to the provinces.8. Instructions have not? been issued by the nationalHealth Insurance Commissioners to their Local Insurance Committees embodying the arrangements arrived at between theCommissioners and the Ministry for the provision of general practitioner treatment to uninsured discharged soldiers and for an improved machinery for the treatment of Tuberculosis among discharged soldiers.    The salient features of these arrangements are as fallows:-(a) Medical attendance, treatment and the necessary supply of medicine and appliances will be afforded to discharged soldiers with Incomes of less than . .100 a yeex under the same arrangements as apply to insured men *     In order to enablea discharged man to obtain the services of a medical practitioner without any delay upon his discharge from service the Ministry have arranged to supply the man with a medical voueher which he will present to the doctor selected.(b) In response to a demand from the panel doctors that they should receive special terms of remuneration for attendance upan the discharged disabled man the Insurance Cowriesloners arranged that payment should be made to them upon an attendance basis inste&amp;d of by a capitation fee such as applies to the trdinarr insured population^     In consideration of this method ofpayment
payment it has been arranged- that* medloal prsurUJrioner^ eh/mld keep a c^sntlnuoua-record of the treatment given by them to each discharged disabled man which record will be made available for the purposes of the Ministry.   It is believed that by these means a more reliable estimate of a man&apos;s disablement will be obtainable for-purposes of assessment of pension than is at present possible under the system by which men are only aeen at&quot;their examination by Medical Boards at six monthly wr other intervals.(o)   The arrangements for       prevision of treatment In cases of Tuberculosis among discharged soldiers have been substantially improved.- In the first place the grants made under Treasury sanction towards the cost of obtaining priority treatment at the time of his discharge for a man then requiring Institutional treatment for Tuberculosis have been extended at the suggestion of the Ministry to all oases of discharge from the commencement cf the war up to the present date where Institutional treatment is still required and further will be payable also for all eases hereafter given Institutional treatment within six months of the manfs discharge from service.   In consideration -of these grants the Insurance Commissioners undertake t* seofcre that Insurance Committees provide the man with such treatment as in the judgment of the tuberculosis officer is suitable to his case.   In the second plaoc institutional treatment will be provided for all eases of advanced and incurable tuberculosis at the cost of the Ministry.   The funds of Insurance Committees have it is understood not usually been able to previde institutional treatment for cases of this elass and the provisions of Article 6 cf the Royal Warrant will be accordingly used for this purpose.A copy of the Instructions issued by the Insurance Commissioners forme Appendix V te this report. $* Proposals arc under the consideration *f the Ministryfor.the formation cf sub-centres for orthopaedic treatment fer discharged men which would be operated in conjunction with thelarge
largo military orthopaedic hospitals *    The demand for orthopaedics treatment  or the disabled men before discharge has increased to such an extent as to make it probable thatspecial prevision will la required for di*ehar ed man andit is clearly desirable that the treatment should be carriedout in close ee-operation with the Uilitary Medical Service.10. The instructions for the Treatment and Training, ofDisabled I.:en provide (in Schedule I en page 1?) for thepayment by Local Pensions Committees to civil hospitals forin-patient or out-patient treatment given to discharged disabled men,.    The rates in question were arrived at On the basisof the existing practice of local authorities   and etherGovernment Departments who have occasion to use these hospitals.    The British Uedieal Association are now. howeveri pressing for payment to be made to the medioal staffs of the&apos; hospitals for their services in addition to payment for themaintenance of the patients.    This would be a big departure from existing practice and it is by no means certain whether the medical profession generally would support it.    There are, moreover, other considerations involved which make it undesirable for the Hinistry to agree with the sussestion of the British Kedical Association,    The^question has already come up locally in *ne or two areas and is certain to be brought forward elsewhere.    Arrangements for treatment in losal hospitals are necessarily a matter of negotiation bet* ween the Local Committees and the Hospital Committees and it has been thought advisable to furnish the Hepresentstives of the Ministry in the Provinces with the answer to the claim of the Association in cass they are faced with the. &apos; difficulty in any such negotiations.    Tho letter which forms Appendix VI has accordingly been addressed to them.
11.Appendix VIS shows the number of paraplegic caeeathat have been reported te Dr. Fox-Symons up to the SlfitJuly, 19X7, under tfar Office instructions end what has happenedto them since.    The total is 1,209 of which 441 have stillhospitals or were sent hoitt* or terminated in death dxring the month.12. Prom the weekly return received from the Spec ledIlerUeal Board it appears that the number of neurasthenic oases receiving treatment in the Home at CJoJLd^r?   Green and in  arm Gamps were en the 29th instant as follows j-.Treatment of neurasthenia by the method of boarding-cutin private homes has been sanctioned experimentally for the purposes of the London ftor Pensions Committee.    It has been thought desirable to limit the number of cases to be dealt with in the first, instances to 30 and to draw up instructions to the householders who undertake to beard men as to the manner in which they should deal with them.    The selection of cases to be treated in this manner and the general supervision of the scheme will be carried out by Dr. Lumsden, one of the Medical Referees employed by the London w&quot;ar Pensions Committee acting in consult-ation with Lt, Col, Sir John Collie. President of the Special Hedical Board-13, Under the special arrangements made by the Ministrywith the liana&amp;erc of the Metropolitan Asylums Beard for the treatment of advanced cases of tuberculosis among discharged soldiers 25 men vere reported as under treatment on the  Oth instant.14, Appendix VIII shows -ohe arrangements for treatment forwhich general sanction km aukod by and given te Local &quot;Committees during the week ended the 29th instant;.     It is apparent that the steps taken by she -.&apos;inisory to which reference was made In paragraph 11 of last week&apos;s report for the circulation of thete be dealt with.11G cases were transferred te civilIn the Kerne, Golders areen V/itham Farm Colony89 15lists

Of these 115 were treated in hospitals and other institutions * ?he total number of cases reported as under treatment at the end of the week was 414*   The returns camw*t however be relied upon as complete.16. Appendix z shows that sanction **a given to specialtreatment in 49 Individual cases not covered by general schemes.Training.17. Agricultural  raining.    Approval has been given to a scheme proposed by the Joint Committee for lie in tit a r and Connaught for Agricultural Training in Glaelcven College. The men Kill bo selected for training by the experts of the Agricultural College.    A similar arrangement has been made for the use of the Jlorth of Scotland Agricultural College, Cranstone, *hioh can aoccrokodata 40 disabled men for agricultural training,   $he men will be similarly selected by experts.16.   Industrial  raining&apos;    The Hinistry have attaohed great Importance to a disabled man&apos;s earning ca^city and the wages whloh he should be able to earn after a period of training, being Aetcrmloed in accordance with expert advice.   The constitution and mode of operation of the Advisory Kages Boards, which are to secure this are set out in Appendix XI.A and Appendix XI.B contains the Regulations under which theBoards will act.        At the present time Advisory Ttoges Boards have been constituted In about 7 districts.   -Ihess boards are purely advisory, but may berelied
relied On to carry considerable weight in the adjustment of the very difficult question of the wages payable to disabled men.

19. Appendix XII contains a report of the meetings of certain Trade Advisory Committees during the week, namely, those for Boot wad Shoe Manufacture and Boot and Shoe Repairing, and for Tailoring.

20. Appendix XIII is a memorandum on a school for training in Lamp working recently opened by Sheffield University. The Ministry&apos;s Representative for the area of the Joint Committee for Yorkshire has been requested to send copies of this memorandum to all the Local Committees in his area and to draw their attention to the facilities provided at this schools.

21. Appendix XIV chows the general schemes of training that have been submitted and sanctioned during the week. The output remains small for reasons given in the ? two reports. The Joint Committees we being, circular?ed with a view to their taking action well in advance of the coming season.

22. Appendix XV ? that 19 ? were admitted to training by Load Committees or otherwise in the week ending 29th August that that the total number reported as under training at the and of the week is 132. There is reason to believe that these figures are not yet complete, since cases in which training had been ? before the instructions of the Ministry were issued are not included.

23. Appendix XVI shows that in 27 individual cases not covered by general section was given during the week to the training of disabled men.

24. In three cases sanction was given under Article 14(3) of the Royal Warrant of the 20th March to the training widows in Midwifery during the week.

25. The satisfactory results of a recent visit of Major Mitchell representing the Ministry and Lord Sandwich representing the


the Red Cross Society to Switzerland with a view to starting the training of disabled men interned there are set forth in $he former^ Report in Appendix XVII,Organisation,25 A statement of the prooeedincs of the StatutoryCommittee for the week ending 29th August, 1917, is annexed (Appendix XVIII).    In County Wioklow, with its eight diotfriofc Committees, the work is light hut satisfactory.    15iddiesborough is well reported on hut the Inspector states that discharged men are.so tired of discipline in any form that they avoid treatment and training and start to work on theppresent high wage3. Northarr.pton and Nuneaton are suffering through lack of organisation, whilst the indiffer-em.ee of the V/olverhampton Local Committee was probably responsible for the initial hostility shov/n by a deputation of the Federation of disabled soldiers and sailoro to the Parliamentary Under Secretary on the occasion of a recent visit.    The sub-committees qf  the Lanarkshire County Committee are only now entering upon their work, but its necessity and magnitude are realized and real provision le being made for the needs of disabled men;    The demand for labour in some towns, such as Lancaster and Barrow-in*Furness, lightens the labours of the Committees.The Inspector for tho South Y;ales fcrea, Gloucester and Hereford draws an interesting contrast between work in the Mining and Agricultural Counties and refers to forces, specially in Glamorgan and Ilonmouth, vrhich render Government control difficult yet notwithstanding   various inimical factors he is able to report considerable improvement in many places and throughout the nine counties.I   27 Tho first issue of the Interallied Reeducation * etcBulletin giving recent pension etc. la;.s of Belgium, Prance, I   Italy, Germany and the soldiers part of our ov/n Rojqal $arrant efinarch
104March 29th is annexed hereto as Appendix XIXAand a precis of it as Appendix XIX. E.r s.        The fifth issue of the Vvar Pensions Gazette (Appendix XX) contains a leading article by Mr. C,J. Kathew, X.C., C.BJS., cn the passing nf the Statutory Committee and the advent of the Special Grants Committee, a description of the work of the VJeet Ham Local Committee and articles on the employment of deaf mutes, on industries unsuitable for training, and on market gardening and the training of men as small holders.Staff.29, The functions of the Statutory Committee transferredto the Ministry under the Havel and military V.ar Pensions,  c.,(Transfer of Fowers) Act, 1917, as from to-day, are being takenover by three divisions of the Ministry, two of which are alreadyin existence.    Appendix X/-.I 3hows the resulting organisation.In the first place, the duties as to the Treatmentnowand Tsntining of discharged officers, men, and widows are/allotted to the Third Division of the Ministry and the staff employed thereon, though hitherto &quot;bo me on the books of the Statutory Committee, have for some weeks past been working under the direct control of the Assistant Secretary of that Division.    The functions of the Third Division are now confined to questions of Treatment and Training as the General and Establishment Branches have for some time been worked as separate branches under the direct control of the Secretary.Alternative Pensions under Article 3 of the Royal V/arrant, which replace the supplementation of pensions previously undertaken by the Statutory Committee, have been allocated to the Second Division of the Ministry and the Branch has been aecoirtmodated at Chelsea in order to be in close touch with the awarding sections there.A
A new Division of the Ministry id being established styled the Fourth Division, (the Finance Division becoming the Fifth) under the charge cf an Assistant Secretary-    This Division will include the Special Grants Committee and the General Branch which will combine the existing General Branah and the Organisation Branch of the Statutory Committee.    The work of the Special Grants Committee will be divided into three sections.    The first of these will deal with Supplementary Separation Allowances, Forfeitures and &quot;Questions of Fact&quot;. (Section 3(l)(a) of the 1915 Act).     The Second Section will deal with Special Allowances and Supplementary Allowances and apprentices.    The Third Section with cases of officers, not dealt with by the other branches of the Ministry,and all Education cases,31* Table III show an addition of 13 to the staff of theMinistry during the week, 1 having been added to the Administrationf 28 to the Awards to Soldiers Branch, 10 to the Awards to widows Branch whilst in the Pensions Issue Off icy, ;here there are now 86 holiday workers to replace girls on their annual leave, there is a decrease of 26.     The staff on the bcoks of the Ministry now   j comprises 182 men and 3821 i*omen, or 4,003 in all.    The staff coming over frcm the Statutory Committee consists of 109 men and 184 women or 293 in all, bringing up the grand total to 4,29G. 31. The daily percentage of absences during the week was3*1 among the male and S.3 among the female Btaff.     The large percentage of absences amongst the female staff is probably due to the fact that extended leave without pay is not being granted and in consequence a medical certificate is frequently sent in to secure further leave.M.1\T.1st September, 1917.

From that time the local worker has been an essential part of the machinery by means of which the promise given to our men was to be redeemed.At the begmning of 1916 the Statutory Com-mitte was appointed, and the bulk of the work was transferred to them, and the National Belief Fund released from responsibility from July 1,1916.When the Statutory Committee started it was of the greatest importance that no break should take place in the continuity of the work, and that the local workers, who had done so well, should not be caused any unnecessary inconveniencej but nevertheless, as the Committee were in charge of public funds, it was found that the then familiar War Circulars had to be replaced by far more intricate and detailed regulations, and that the local workers would have to be asked to submit their accounts to the stern eye of an inspector. The local workers accepted the new conditions with extremely little grumbling, and for the most part the nevv^ regulations were accepted with kindly tolerance, most usefully criticised and loyally carried out. The new regulations Avere of considerable length and intricacy, but they at least demonstrated the intention of the Statutory Committee to&apos;cover as wide a field as possible and to deal with all sorts of different emergencies and conditions of life. Some persons were quite sure that nobody could understand them, but in a comparatively short time the local workers, who had then become an integral part of the Statutory Committee as their Local War Pensions Com mittees, had mastered them and Avere indeed so far reconciled to them, that they were constantly asking for more, all leading to the gradual improve-ment of the scheme, and the Statutory Committee did its best to meet their wishes.As the war continued, the whole question became hourly vaster and more complicated, especially in regard to the training and treatment of the wounded, and Parliament in its wisdom once more intervened and decided that the whole work of dealing with our disabled sailors and soldiers and the wives and families of those who would never return, as well as separation allow-ances, should be concentrated under one authority,
and should be put in charge of a Minister of Pensions. .;&apos;..The Statutory Committee, although naturally not.absolutely convinced of the superiority of the new arrangement, were perfectly content to agree, as their only wish was that the best should be done for those to whom the Nation owes so much, and were more than content when MJr. Barnes, one of their own members, who had taken a vital interest in all branches of the work from the time the Statutory Committee came into existence, was appointed Minister. The selection of Mr. Barnes was a most happy augury for the future. A man of great sympathy, with a full knowledge of the wants of those who have fought for us, with a profound conviction that the Nation ought and would do all that was just and generous, and a determination that this intention should be carried out, everyone was satisfied that he was the right person to take charge. In spite of the extremely cordial relations which existed and of every effort on the part of Mr. Barnes, it soon became obvious, as is fully explained in the Vice-Chairman^ article, in the June number, that the Statutory Committee could no longer continue to parry on without causing considerable difficulty to the Local Committees who were anxious to have only one authority with whom they could deal on all questions of administration.But there was one feature of the old system which the Minister was very anxious to preserve, and this was that matters of discretion and diffi-cult questions of fact, including the policy as to forfeiture, should be dealt with by some inde-pendent body of persons who were not officials of the. Ministry, and who would be empowered to deal with such matters on equitable grounds, and so he provided for the creation of a Special Grants Committee to carry on the work in the same spirit as had previously actuated the Statutory Committee.. The Special Grants Committee are empowered to make regulations, but there is no intention that the Local Committee will be asked to master a new set of regulations and conditions. Part I. of the old regulations is almost entirely covered by the New Warrant, but simple provisional regula-tions have been issued to enable provision to be made for cases which are not technically within the terms of the Warrant, or which, from their peculiar circumstances, are not treated justly by the Warrant. There must always be such cases gradually diminishing as experience shows how the Warrant should be enlarged or amended, and it is the object of the Ministry to prevent any case that has a right to be considered being cut out by &quot;any mere technicality.I understand that the provisions of Part II. will remain in force as at present, and no new scheme will have to be dealt with, and any alterations that may b emade will be with a view to enlarging the scop and simplifying the application of the presen regulations^ These will be financed otet-of th vote of the Ministry of Pensions, and will not L charged against the  500,000 which will be place at the disposal of the Special Grants Committe to enable them to deal with cases, for the tim being, outside the New Warrant, or, in specia cases, to supplement the provision made thereby and also to continue the grants for education While the actual administration will be in th hands of the Ministry, all questions which in th past have been referred by the Local Committet to the Statutory Committee for final award will in future, be referred to the Special Grants Com mittee, whose decision will be final, thus, it hoped, preventing any suggestion that a les elastic view will be taken in the future than hi been taken in the past.The policy of the forfeiture work will h controlled by the Special Grants Committee, an it is hoped that the Local Committees will gh every help in developing the possibilities of thi branch of our work. The punitive side is c small importance in comparison with the opportu nity it affords of really helping women who at only in need of a little sympathetic advice an encouragement, to prevent them going undw Where it is necessary, Local Committees will sti be asked to find guardians for children, and it i hoped that full use will be made of the powers xs have to administer pensions and allowances i trust in all cases where forfeiture can be avoidei It is well worth the work it involves if it ca prevent the misery which must be caused by tli home being broken up while the man is away After all it was the war that took him away an left the woman to struggle alone against difficult it and temptations which would not have arisen ha he been there to help. Already it has been form that there are many cases where it is possible 1 avoid forfeiture, and by arranging that the pensio: or separation allowance should, for a time, h administered by a friendly and helping hand excellent results have been attained and permanen disaster avoided.The names of the members of the Special Grant Committee will be found elsewhere. It will b seen that the list includes persons of wide experi ence, representing all sections of society, and full; conversant with all the difficulties and all tb possibilities of the great work with which they ait to be associated.The Ministry is particularly lucky in bavin: secured the services of Mrs. McKenna, Mrs. Shake spear and Miss Kelly. With an intimate know ledge of all the details of the work, particularly ii reference to separation allowance and the pension: of widows and dependents the work of Mrs McKenna upon the Statutory Committee was
invaluable and unending, and it would have been a real misfortune if anything had prevented her services; being available for the Special Grants Committee. Mrs^ Shakespear, as Secretary of the Bhmingham Local Committee, will bring a ripe experience of all tbe difficulties and questions which arise from the Local Committee&apos;s point of view, and their possible solution. Miss Kelly, the Secretary of one of the best organised of the Local Committees, namely, Portsmouth, will not only bring her great knowledge of the work, but will, in a unique way, represent the wants and wishes of the Navy, which has always been her especial care.To me, personally, and to all members of the Statutory. Committee,.it is a matter of great regret that Mr.&quot; Cyril Jackson felt unable to accept the Chairmanship.Only tbose who have worked under bim can really appreciate the value of his labours as Vice-chairman of the Statutory Committee.If, as they surely will, .the Local Committees carry on the magnificent work they are doing in the certain knowledge that they are partners of and not in rivalry with the Ministry, then we shall-be able to redeem, and redeem fully, the promise made when our men went out to light, and that never again can the charge be brought against the Nation, that when war is over, and the victory won, they are swift to forget what is due to those who made the victory possible.CHAELES J. MATHEW.Monthly Notes.-o-The Bill for the Transfer of Powers of the Statutory Committee has now passed through both Houses of Parliament.   The number of members Naval and     of the Special Grants Committee has Military War   been increased, by an amendment in Pensions, etc., the House of Lords with the assent of (Transfer of   the Minister, from ten to twelve Powers) Bill,  persons.The day appointed for the actual transfer is the 31st August, and after that date the Statutory Committee will cease to exist.Our leading article this month deals with, the evolution of the Special Grants Committee and the steps taken to ensure continuity of administration.In order to secure that disabled men on discharge from military service should pass with the least possible delay under the care of their panel doctors Medical     &apos; arrangements   were   made   by  the Vouchers.     Insurance Commission in the second year of the War, whereby men were given a special paper of Instructions telling them how to get into communication with their Local Insurance Committees and Approved.Societies.   Experience, how-ever, has shown that a large number of men do not pay attention to this leaflet, or mislay it, and in consequence do not obtain the treatment they should from their panel doctors until a considerable time has elapsed after their discharge. In order to avoid this, the Ministry in co-operation with the Insurance Commissioners have arranged that steps should be taken to furnish the man on discharge with a Medical Voucher, which he can at once present to a panel doctor in his own place of residence in order to obtain treatment; and the Ministry have undertaken to distribute these cards to each man with the notification that is sent from the Ministry as to the award of pension or gratuity. Under this arrange-nient there should be no excuse for delay on the part of - the man in obtaining the necessary treatment.-o-Representations have been made by Local Committees and others that considerable hardship is caused to discharged men whose teeth have had Artificial      to be extracted during their military Teeth.        service and who under arrangements hitherto existing were not supplied with artificial teeth.   In certain cases, chiefly in Gastric complaints, a man&apos;s teeth have been extracted as a necessary incident of the treatment otherwise given him. Arrangements have now been made by which artificial teeth may be supplied to discharged soldiers and sailors at public expense : (1) &quot;Where the dental defect requires.the pro-vision of artificial teeth and such defect can be attributed to conditions arising from or aggravated by Naval or Military service, those conditions to be assumed in any case where the man&apos;s teeth have been extracted while in the service ; and(2) Where the discharged man is undergoing treatment and the artificial teeth are reported to be necessary for the efficacy of that treatment. The Ministry have been in,consultation with the Ivory Cross Society, a voluntary organisation formed for the purpose of supplying artificial teeth to disabled men and others in need of assistance of this nature, and it is proposed to take advantage of the Panel of Dentists -throughout the Kingdom with which this Society have made arrangements, for the purpose of this supply both in cases where it can be made at the public expense under the above conditions and in other cases.which the Society are prepared to deal with at their own expense. -o-Under the heading &quot; The Treatment and Training of the Disabled &quot; we print this month the major portion of the extremely interesting report -pve-The Inter-Allied pared for the Minister by Sir Arthur Conference.

The Employment of Deaf and Dumb &quot;Workmen  During the  War.--o-Attention is drawn to an article in the &quot; Bulletin des psines de Guerre,&quot; to the unfortunate prejudice which exists against the employment of deaf, or deaf and dumb, workmen. At the present time, when there is such urgent need of man power, it is important to facilitate as far as possible the employment of all who are not actually physically incapable.In an article in the &quot;Deaf and Dumb Gazette,&quot; JI. Henri Gaillard maintains that it is a great error to include deaf, or deaf and dumb, men in the category of the infirm.   The editor of this journal states that large numbers of these men are successfully employed in munition factories, some earning as much as twenty francs a day.   The main obstacle to their employment appears, to be the fear that they will be subject to accidents connected with the machinery in the work-shops, but it is stated that there are far fewer accidents of this kind among deaf and dumb workers than among workers who can hear and are in the habit of talking to each other.   It has been found that the disability makes the worker more attentive to his machine and to the risks he may run.  The insurance companies regard the additional risk to men of this kind as almost negligible -they do not ask for any premium in cases where the infirmity is a result of war service.   M. Quilland has written a pamphlet describing the way in which deaf and dumb men, deprived owing to the war of their normal occupations, were driven to volunteer for work - in munition factories.   They were taken at first only on trial, but as they mostly proved to be excellent workmen, they were kept on.   Brief technical demonstrations sufficed as training for many sober deaf and dumb men, who were much preferred to slow-witted alcoholic men in full possession of their hearing.The old restrictions relating to the employment of these men have now been revised. At the works of Messrs. Farman Bros, over fifty are employed in the manufacture of aeroplanes and they have been par-ticularly successful. They are also employed in similar work at Voisin, de Dion, and Benault. Work in iron industries has also been found particularly suited to them. .... .No such thing as absolute deafness exists ; even in the most serious cases there is always a perception of certain phenomena of sound. The conclusion has been reached that it would be most inhuman and unjust to prevent deaf and dumb workmen from working in factories. Every opportunity should be given for their abilities to be tested, and the utmost use made of them in whatever occupations are found to be most suitable.A List of Industries Considered Ordinarily Unsuitable for Training.-o-The attention of Local Committees is drawn to the fact that certain trades which at first sight appear to . provide suitable openings for disabled men, and for which many disabled men desire to be trained, are in fact ordinarily undesirable as a subject of training unless there are special circumstances in the case. The object in view is to provide training for men in occupations in which they are likely to obtain a permanent livelihood at a satisfactory wage, and the fact that, owing to the absence of a very large number of men on war service, there is a great temporary demand for men in certain occupations, does not necessarily prove that it is desirable to train men in these occupations. Careful enquiries have been made into this subject and attention is drawn to the occupations mentioned at the foot of this note and to the reasons which in each case make training undesirable in them.It is desired that Local Committees will specially direct the attention of their hospital visitors to these facts, as great disappointment is caused to men who, whilst in hospital, have been persuaded to decide on a course of training for a certain industry, and who find when they apply to their Local Committee, that that training is not approved.Reasons.1.

The equipment has been provided by Mr. Oppenheimer at a cost which will amount to  1,500 in respect of machinery and fittings. The men will be trained for a period of six months, and the cost of running the institute will be provided by Mr. Oppen-heimer, who undertakes also, at the end of the period of&apos;training, to employ the men, if found suitable for a period of three years and to give them a commencing wage of  2 a week, subject to increase in accordance with their efficiency. It is estimated that competent men will be able to earn within three years anything between  3 and  5 a week. Special arrangements are also being made for the men to be lodged during their period of training.
Local Committees at Work.-o-No. 5.-The Borough o  West Ham.- o-If you follow the Mile End Road out through Aldgate, the London Ghetto, to Bow Bridge you come to the Western Border of West Ham, a huge industrial district comprising miles of industrial dwellings some of a nearly prehistoric class. It extends Eastward to Forest Gate, Upton, Plaistow, Custom House, southward to Silver-town, Tidal Basin and Canning Town, and north as far as Leytonstone and Forest Gate.In its confines are many fine manufactming concerns, employing huge numbers of men and now of women. The Great.Eastern Bailway Works situated at Stratford employ&apos;very many men, but in reality West Ham is one of the places &quot;where London&apos;s workers sleep.&quot; The early train, the early &apos;bus or tram takes them into town in thousands and back they come at night swarming, patiently waiting for their places if only &quot; standing seats &quot; as they with cockney resignation would say.From such a district you might naturally conclude that enlistment especially in the early stages of the War was tremendous. The National Belief Fund manned and womaned by splendid Voluntary Workers took on the administration of supplementing and advancing separation allowances, visiting dependents and all the hundred and one duties entailed on them in the adrninistration of the Prince of Wales&apos;s Fund, etc.In May, 1916, The West Ham War Pensions Committee was formed to carry on these and fuller duties. At that /time there were three district offices. These have since been reduced to two, one for the North of the Borough in Stratford at the Town Hall, one for the South in Canning Town at the Public Hall, right in the great Dock district of the Borough. The Town Clerk kindly undertook the duties of Honorary Secretary and two Lady Clerks were appointed, one for the north and one for the south. It was soon found that the duty of considering special cases was extremely heavy and Bota Committees to meet at least once a week were appointed in each District. I say without reservation that there are no &quot; leisured classes &quot; in West Ham. The Committees consist of hard working men and women, employers and employed, and the regularity and patience which both classes have displayed in attending the Meetings of The Pensions Committee, The ^Executive Committee, and the Sub-Committees, especially the Rota Committees where a grasp of the intricate and constantly varying conditions or regulations is essential, has been wonderful and commendable.It has recently been arranged that the Voluntary Workers shall have power to attend Committees1, but not to vote and their enthusiasm is such that they come !We Pension Workers in West Ham have much pleasure in acknowledging the many kind and generous helpers. Firstly, the Mayor and Corporation who have always been willing to help. The Town Clerk, Mr. G. E. Hilleary always ready with wise and courteous counsel, and his Staff, the Borough Treasurer, our HonoraryAuditor, and his Staff.   The Statutory Committee hav been most prompt in help in difficult cases, aiaci we ar indebted to the Police, the Charity Organisation Society, the local Hospitals and other agencies for willing an welcome help.We have had over 15 months&apos; experience, and what ar the lessons that we have learned or should have learne during these months ? FIRSTLY IN REGARD T SEPARATION ALLOWANCES AND DEPENDENTS In the Northern District practically all payments ar made by Voluntary Workers at the dependents&apos; home and this system has much to commend it. The Voluntan Workers show their practical interest in the recipient and keep in closer touch with home conditions than i cases where the dependents, as in the South of tli Borough have to attend at the Pensions Office for the&apos; allowance. We want more Voluntary Visitors in th South ; the few we have are enthusiasts worthy of ai praise. I believe that in certain other districts, notabl; Manchester, the paying is done at dependents&apos; homes b; Voluntary Workers and that there also this has bee-found to be a successful policy.Next we come to a very difficult question. One tlia I know has had the grave consideration of the Statutoi Committee, but one which as I am given the chance c publicity I feel that I must air, namely, the delays i Assessment of Dependents&apos; Allowances: I am informed that we pay at the Canning Tow Office on an average 150 dependents per week who ar waiting for settlement of their claim. Some of tlies people have been coming regularly for more than thn months (approximately 100). Many of them have bee coming for four and some for five months. In mo: cases the dependent is a widow whose sole maintenam ceased on her son&apos;s enlistment and there is continue anxiety in the minds of many elderly and ignora women as to whether after all Separation Allowance w be issued, in view of the protracted delay. Furthe. the ultimate assessment of the Pensions CommitU being unknown when the advances are made, it difficult to issue such an amount as will be fair to a applicant and yet avoid bringing her into debt.This also applies to unmarried wives but with increase difficulty. As an instance: Four cases are beir dealt with in which the woman states that she has bee supported by the soldier (for periods ranging from seve to fourteen years). A family of children have to 1 kept, and the man has done everything possible on li side by making the allotment of 3s. 6d. per week, to ii dependent.If the Committee advance full Separation Allowaii&apos; (wife&apos;s) they risk the loss of sums varying from  20 I  30 before settlement is made, as on enquiry it may 1 found thatthe man has a legal wife who is able to clai the allowance. On the other hand, if this Commit!-cover themselves by meagre advances the unhap] woman and children suffer semi-starvation for possiL&apos; four or five months.One of our Lady Clerks writes as follows :  &quot; There is one point, however, which I should like I
raise, it may be visionary but I believe could &quot;be very beneficial; It is &apos; This misery of Boots.5 I have often thoughtf-tfhat if the War Pensions Committee could organise a club into which the women would pay perhaps Is. a week, and draw by ballot as they do in their money clubs, sums of  1 from one to twenty weeks, to be&apos; expended on boots, we should be saving a good many applicants some worry at least. A 5 per cent, bonus on every  1 would be a big incentive to thrift in this direction. With the increased prices of- shoe leather, the woman v?ho are bad managers (I do not blame then but, alas, their number is legion) cannot possibly arrange their allowance to leave any margin for these necessary articles and the ensuing winter is likely to prove more difficult than ever. I wonder if this arrangement might be made official. I would personally undertake all work connected with it in my district.&quot; Now we come to my second heading.WITH REGARD TO TREATMENT AND TRAINING OF DISABLED SOLDIERS OR SAILORS. This will become every day a more and more important subject and one to which Pension Workers will have to bend their backs.In the early days of the War, the flower of our chivalry and manhood, young and old, were streaming to their country&apos;s help. Prom the casual labourer who had probably started life in a blind alley career, to the rich idler who had never had any particular object in life, they &quot; joined up,&quot; and many have joined the majority. Others will be coming back, many we hope whole and sound, some we know maimed. Yes, and even the flower and chivalry who may have been quite competent to support themselves before the war will want our ready help to adapt themselves to their new bodily conditions brought about by this devastating war, and so I should like to quote again from my informant with regard to more publicity for &quot; TRAINING SCHEMES-In regard to the Treat-ment and Training of Disabled Men, there still remains need for advertisement. I hear there are posters printed, but I have not seen one. Why not post them in our omnibuses, etc. ? We again and again receive applications from discharged soldiers and sailors who have no knowledge of the powers of the War Pensions Committee to assist them, although they have been out of the services in some cases for more than six months.      . .-&quot; The card given to the men on discharge advises them to come to the War Pensions Committee for assistance, but does not Estate that such assistance will not undermine their independence. It is generally read by the men as meaning that appeals for money will be listened to by the Committee, and I am glad to say thait many of them under these circumstances will not make application. Unfortunately, therefore, opportunities of service are lost. One instance will illustrate my point. A.J.W. discharged on June 8th, 1917, was only in receipt of 14s. per week temporary allowance pending issue of pension.   He has a sister entirely dependentupon him, and was at his wits end how they were, to live, when fortunately he met a member of my Committee, who informed him of the functions of the War Pensions Conunittee and sent him there.&quot; He was in a highly nervous condition, had trench feet and had been badly gassed. He was evidently quite unable to do any work and was harassed about his future, in view of the fact that he could no longer carry on his old trade.&quot; When it was^explained to him that not only could he be cared for and receive proper medical treatment, but following that be helped to a suitable occupation he frankly said he &quot; could not believe it, it sounded too good to be true.&apos; Since then he has been away to Convalescent treatment and has returned to London eager to begin training as an electrical engineer, in which trade he will undoubtedly do well. The whole point-is that had he not accidentally met a member of the Committee he would have been at this present time, possibly, struggling to do casual work and gradually sunk into permanent ill-health. Experience in this District shows that the younger men are very enthu-siastic on the training schemes.&quot;CONVALESCENT TREATMENT.-After the war im-mediate public attention must be given to phthisis. At present, although a soldier or sailor discharged phthisical may be fortunate enough to obtain sanatorium treat-ment, yet, for all the organised precautions taken, he may, after his discharge become a centre of infection. It is true that he can call upon a panel doctor and get cod liver oil or medicine, but this appears to be the whole extent of the subsequent care he receives.With regard to convalescent treatment of wounded men, what a splendid idea it would be if more middle-class people would open their homes in the country for hospitality for discharged men; it would enable the men to have two or three weeks rest, and would be of real use probably to the soldiers and certainly to them-selves.I fear that I have wandered from my headline, &quot; The West Ham War Pensions Committee at Work,&quot; but if we cannot learn lessons from our work it is poor work, and I am sure that I can speak for every member of the Committee and its officers in saying that if they succeed in helping back to full manhood again some of those who have been sent back physical wrecks they will not feel that they have lived in vain.THOS. ALEX. COOK,Chairman West Ham Pensions Committee.Instructions have been issued that no soldier is to be transferred to Class P. or P. (T.) of the Reserve. Owing to the passing of the Military Service (Review of Excep-tions) Act, 1917, the transfer of physically unfit men to the Reserve, Class P. or P. (T.) in order that they might not be freed from all obligation to serve the country during the war is no longer necessary.
The Treatment and Training of the Disabled.- --o-No. 5.-The Inter-Allied Conference.--o-From Sib Arthur  Griffith:-Boscawen&apos;s Report.  -o-The Conference was organised by a Franco-Belgian Committee under the Presidency of Baron de Brocque-ville, the Belgian Minister of Wax, whose place at the Conference was actually taken by the Belgian Minister of the Interior. It was formally opened in the presence of the President of the French Republic on the afternoon of May 8th.I think that the discussions in the sections and the frank interchange of opinions&apos; in conversation between men and women of the several nations deeply interested in the questions under discussion were very valuable. I attach much more importance to them than to the actual resolutions.I do not think that I need do more myself than to summarise some of the main conclusions arrived at, so far as they are confirmed by my own experiences : (1) Interest in the Subject. I was struck very much with the great interest which the subject evoked. Repre-sentatives of France, Belgium, Russia, Portugal, Italy, and Serbia took active part in the discussions, and in addition to this, the Conference was largely attended, showing that the &quot; Reeducation des Mutiles de la guerre,&quot; as the French call it, is recognised by a great section of the French public as a most urgent and important social problem. As M. Leon Bourgeois said at the opening of the Conference, there is a &quot; solidarity morale &quot; among the Allied nations. It is possible that in this country we have somewhat lagged behind in the recognition of its inportance, partly no doubt in con-sequence of the fact that at the beginning of the war our losses were very much smaller than those of the French, and that we did not anticipate our large army and heavy casualties. It is hoped that the recent policy of the Ministry of Pensions, especially the provisions of the new Warrant and the institution of Joint Disablement Committees operating over large areas of the country, will go far towards removing the initial want of interest, and will bring home to the people generally the urgency of the question.(2) As regards treatment. In one important respect the practice in France and among the Belgians differs from our own. No man is discharged from the Army until his cure is complete, so far as this is possible. When I was pointing out in my section the inducements offered by Article 6 of the new Warrant to discharged men to undergo further treatment, and the penalty for refusal imposed by Article i, the French and Belgian members of the section could not understand what I had in view. Treatment, they said is &quot; reeducation fonctionelle,&quot; and that is all completed before the man is discharged. Therefore, the man is still under discipline and can becompelled to undergo it.   I know that this question has been discussed frequently with the War Office, who hav stated that they are unable to retain disabledVffien for , longer time in the Army than they do at present, but think it my duty to record the fact that the French an Belgian military authorities accept a larger responsibilit for the disabled, and, at all events, profess to retain thei until they require no further treatment either as in patients or out-patients.  Thus the danger of men goin back to work before they are physically fit to do so whereby health may be permanently impaired,isavoided The only cases where treatment after discharge is eai to take place in France or Belgium are those in which man&apos;s condition gets worse after he leaves the Army.(3) Training or &quot; R6-6ducation Professionelle&quot; TL greatest amount of interest is taken in this by the Frencl the Belgians and so far as I can judge by all the Allic Not only are workshops attached to all the French an Belgian hospitals, but there are also large establishment specially set up for re-education.   We visited what perhaps the finest example of these, viz., the &quot; Institui Militaire Beige des Muffins, Invalides et Orphelins &quot; a Port-Villez, which has been built on a magnificent sit overlooking the Seine half-way between Paris and Rouei and accommodates about 1,300 disabled men.   Here ai the most complete installation of electrical and othc appliances for orthopaedic treatment and some 2 separate workshops where almost every conceivahl trade is taught.   Training is compulsory, as it is in al French, Belgian and Italian hospitals, the doctor bavin the principal voice in deciding what trade the man is t learn, and being guided naturally by considerations the curative quality of various forms of manual trairiiii in each case.   As is remarked in several of the paper which I attach, the man himself appears to have littl voice in deciding his future, while a battle royal betweet the doctor and the technical expert often rages over hi mutilated body.   Here, again, the practice in France Belgium and Italy differs from our own in the fact tha the training in the hospitals is compulsory (on the advic and under the supervision of the doctor), whereas it not compulsory in this country, even in orthopaedic anc limbless hospitals which have woikshops attached, am told, however, by those who have experience of these hospitals, that better results are obtained by allowing tlie training to be, voluntary and by appealing to the gooc sense of the men, which may be so ;  and I recogni fully the disciplinary difficulty involved in punishing man who has lost a limb for refusing training.   I hav also some doubts as to how far it is really enforced France.in practice.   In any case, compulsory training ceases in France and Italy as soon as the-man is di charged from the Army.  With the Belgians it different; there is, unhappily, no Belgium for them to go back to, the State, therefore, has to maintain them, and this being so, it compels training so long as it is con sidered that the man requires it.     In France and Italy, however, as soon as the man is discharged from the Army he is free to do as he likes, and can and does refuse further training exactly as he does here.   Shortly before
e Conference opened, a very important paper was ued by the French Minister of Education, pointing out s extresjjg difficulty of getting discharged soldiers to ail themselves of the opportunities offered. Here are me extracts from it: &quot; Very many disabled soldiers refuse to avail themselves of the facilities for &apos; reeducation pro-fessionelle&apos; offered to them, either in consequence of their listening to false ideas which are current, or through ignorance of the good results obtained in the schools. Some persist in believing, in spite of assurances reiterated over and over again, that the pension is reduced in consequence of re-educa-tion ; others seem to think that the fact that they have been wounded gives them a right to employ-ment by the State. . . . Others, again, are tempted by the offer of obtaining good wages immediately, and accept employment which is bound to be temporary only. Lastly, there are some who despair altogether of ever being able again to undertake manual labour, not realising the great improvements which can be produced in their condition by training.&quot; We must endeavour to dissipate these prejudices and this ignorance by a vigorous propaganda. We must carry it on among the wounded men while they remain in hospital and when they have left it with-out having been trained. We must carry it on among their families, who, profoundly moved by the fate which awaits the disabled soldier, forget, even when they are not ignorant of it, the organisa-tion which exists for improving their condition. . . .&quot; Beyond all things, we must make it quite clear that neither the life pension nor the renewable pension can be reduced in consequence of re-education.&quot; These are the actual terms of the Act passed by the Chamber of Deputies (Art. 9). The discharged soldier is certain of receiving the whole of his life pension, even when he has been put m a position by means of re-education to earn wages equal to, or greater than what he earned before.&quot; And in the same way the amount of the tem-porary pension, which is always subject to revision, depends in no way on his training, but solely on his physical condition. In deciding whether the temporary pension should be continued at the same rate, or diminished, or converted into a life pension, the discharged soldier is not asked whether he has been re-educated or not, he is examined simply as to whether he has recovered, and in what degree he has recovered, the use of his arm, his leg, &amp;c.&quot; All this might have been written by our Ministry of ensions. It shows that the French have to contend ith exactly the same difficulties as we have ; and while iey could not understand why we required inducements i men to undergo further treatment and penalties for fusal, they were greatly struck with the provisions of tticle 6 of the Warrant with regard to training, which ie President of the 6th Section, M. Honourat, a member the Chamber of Deputies, described as &quot; magnificent.&quot;(4) Employment. It is clear that the French have many of the same difficulties as we have, and do not possess our admirable organisation of Local Committees. The only assistance of this kind available is that of certain voluntary Associations more or less akin to the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society. There appears also to be a certain amount of friction between the French War Office and other Government Departments concerned with the question. There is also the Labour difficulty arising in France as to the wages to be paid to disabled men at work and while they are being trained, which has not been satisfactorily solved. One small but important point came under my notice. The Newcastle representa-tives call attention in their report to the possibility of insurance companies charging higher rates of workmen&apos;s compensation insurance for disabled soldiers than for workmen who are fit in every way, since the former are more likely to meet with accidents, especially when there is machinery running. By a law recently passed in France, an employer does not pay a higher rate for a disabled man, the State paying the difference out of a fund created by a special tax on all employers. This appears to be an altogether admirable arrangement, facilitating the employment of wounded&apos; soldiers, which is worthy of consideration here.* Speaking generally, however, the conditions in France are so dissimilar to those in England, the former being preponderatingly an agricultural country, that the problems of re-employ-ment in the two countries can hardly be compared. The great question in France is to get the men back to the land.(5) Government action and responsibility generally. I was very much struck with the fact that the institution of the single Ministry of Pensions, co-ordinating all questions relating to discharged disabled soldiers, appealed to the Allied delegates as a most excellent plan, the importance of which they had not realised before.In France, several departments War, Labour, Educa-tion, Trade, Interior, &amp;c. are concerned, and there is in consequence a good deal of complaint about overlapping, friction, &amp;c., and the difficulty of getting necessary things done. An attempt at co-ordination was indeed made recently by the establishment of a body called &quot; The National Office,&quot; but it does not appear to have been altogether successful. The same is true of the other countries, with the exception of Belgium, where the con-ditions are simple, as mentioned above, and where, apparently, the War Office takes sole charge. But in this country we-have also the immense advantage of the Local War Pensions Committees, a system which, how-ever, would probably be impossible in a highly centralized country like France. With regard to the scale of pen-sions, we are far ahead of any of our Allies, especially since the issue of the new Warrant. A Class I. pension in France, with corresponds to our highest degree or total* It is only fair to the principal British Insurance Companies to state that they have publicly announced that any soldier or sailor employed, even if disabled and whether discharged or not, is included in their Policies without any addition to the ordinary rate of premium for the Trade.
disablement pension, amounts to 18*75 francs only a week for a private, as compared with 27s. 6d. here. In France pensions are not paid weekly as ours are, but quarterly in arrear, an arrangement which leads to much hardship at the commencing period- It is only fair to the French nation to add that they contemplate an early revision of the scale of pensions, and I think that one of the results of our visit will be to arouse consider-able interest in the terms of our new Warrant. There is one important feature in it which the French and Belgian delegates in the 6th Section entirely disapproved of, and, indeed, failed to understand, and that is the alternative pension. They took their stand on the&quot; principle of absolute equality, and argued that for the same hurt there should always be the same money compensation, irrespective of a man&apos;s circumstances. The argument that a totally disabled man who could earn nothing after the war, but who before the war was earning  3 a week, had made a greater sacrifice than a similarly disabled man who before the war was earning only  1 a week, did not appeal to them in the least. &quot; Both have lost an arm and a leg,&quot; they said, or &quot; both have been blinded,&quot; or &quot;both are totally paralysed,&quot; therefore they should have the same pensions. They thought that we were, as usual, generous but illogical, and I do not think that they will ever appreciate our1 standpoint any more than we shall subscribe to their doctrine of abstract &quot; egaliteV&apos; The Conference, however, agreed to give the question further consideration in special cases.ABTHTJR GBIFFITH-BOSCAWEN.Joint Committees.Training in Bootmaking. 0 The Ministry have confirmed the provisional approval given to a scheme of the Local Committee for Norwich, for training disabled men in Boot repairing. This scheme had been reported on by a Conference of the representatives of the Norwich Boot &amp; Shoe Manufac-turers Association, and of the local branches of the Boot &amp; Shoe Operatives Union. The conference were of opinion that there would be satisfactory openings for men properly trained, but in view of the large number of men now engaged in Boot repairing in the Army, they recommended concentration on the teaching of Boot making, especially hand sewing and finishing.The offer of the National Leather Goods Manufac-turers Association to train partially disabled men in Light Leather Work has been referred to the appro-priate Trade Advisory Committee, which has reported favourably on the proposal, provided that each man receives a total sum of  15 as wages during training and a gift of tools to the value of  5 on the completion of the course and it has been decided to suggest to the London Local Committee that they adopt this as part of their training scheme.A scheme submitted by the Local Committee for the Isle of Man for training disabled men as Boot Repairers is under consideration. . .......-.

Apart from the question of wages, the general conditionsf the work which at times is necessarily heavy and involves exposure, are only suitable to a comparatively Ismail number, of disabled men. The more scientific training offered by the Agricultural Colleges has greater s possibilities, but is obviously only suited to a compara-tively limited number of men.A more promising opening may perhaps be found in market gardening, and in the training of men as small-holders. The Norwich Local Committee have submitted i scheme of this nature which will provide training for some fifty men on an estate a short distance from the City. It is now being carefully considered in consulta-:ion with the Board of Agriculture from the point of view of ascertaining the likelihood of the men so trained securing a&quot; permanent livelihood after their training, n the neighbourhood.The Leicester Local Committee have submitted a iomewhat similar proposal for the training of a small lumber of men, who ultimately would, with the help probably of the Mayor&apos;s (Voluntary) Fund, be supplied nth the small capital necessary to operate a small lolding successfully.A Conference is being arranged with the Board of Agriculture to consider the means by which the training, of disabled men in market gardening or other forms of small holding, can be made to fit in with the Land Settlement Schemes which the Board of Agriculture have in hand, and more generally with the provision of small holdings under the Statutory powers possessed by County Councils. In the meantime, however, sanction has been given to a scheme of horticultural training submitted by the Denbighshire Local Committee. In this case it is proposed to utilise the land of the Wrexham Garden Village, belonging to the Welsh Town-Planning and Housing Trust.Sanction has been given on condition that the Local Committee exercise great care in the selection of men to - be trained and that the training extends over a period of 12 months. The Local Committee have been in-formed that in the case of a man, who intends to become a small holder on the completion of his training, and is financially able to do so, the Minister will be prepared to consider favourably an application for the extension of the course up to a maximum- period of two years, provided that a report by a competent expert is fur-nished before the end of the first year, stating that the additional training would be justified. The expenses incidental to the first year&apos;s training are to be met by the Welsh Town-Planning &amp; Housing Trust, and a fee not exceeding 7s. 6d. per man per week is to be charged in order to repay the advances made by them. It is stipulated, however, that the scheme is not to be brought into operation unless at least.ten men are ready to undergo the training. The Board of Agriculture have been requested to arrange for the periodical inspection of the work in order that the Minister may be assured that the training is satisfactory.The Special Grants Committee,-o-The Special Grants Committee has now been set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Charles J. Mathew, K.C.General Sir F. Stopford and Mrs. McKenna, of the Statutory Committee, have also consented to serve.Local Committees are represented by Mr. Coles-Child, Chairman of the Kent County Local Committee, and Miss Kelly and Mrs. Shakespear, the Secretaries of the Portsmouth and Birmmgham Committees respectively.Other interests are represented by the following gentlemen : Mr. Harry Gosling, L.C.C., J.P., President of the Transport Workers Federation, and Secretary Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen, etc. ; Mr. Herbert Smith, Vice-President of the National Miners Federation of Great Britain ; Mr. W. P. Marshall, Secretary of the Marine Engineers&apos; Society ; Mr. H. May, Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress, and Corporal Linard, a member of the National Union of Railwaymen, who has served in the present war.
Pensions in Parliament.-0-Treatment.Mr. King asked the Pensions Minister, what provision is made out of national funds for the treatment in hospitals other than asylums of cases of uncertifiable loss of mental balance due to nerve-strain in warfare; whether in such cases any of the pension.awarded to the-men is stopped; what is done with the amount stopped&apos;; whether, in the event of the man recovering his balance but being unable to earn what he earned formerly, his pension is stopped on leaving the con-valescent home or hospital; and does it also cease, when similarly circumstanced, on his discharge from an asylum ?The Minister of Pensions (Mr. Barnes): Provision is made for cases of neurasthenia requiring residential treatment both by the Ministry directly and by Local War Pensions Committees. The Home of Recovery at Golder&apos;s Green provides accommodation for 105 cases and arrangements are in progress for the establishment of other homes of the same character. In addition, a number of men have been sent to farm camps where they are provided with work suited to their several conditions. Local War Pensions Committees are also empowered to provide for neurasthenic cases in con-valescent homes or other suitable institutions approved by the Ministry. During treatment an allowance of an amount equivalent to the maximum rate of pension, less Is. a day for maintenance, is payable to the men and an allowance is also provided for their wives and families. On the termination of treatment the pension, if any, originally awarded is resumed. If a man, on discharge from an institution, whether an asylum or hospital, is, though mentally or physically improved, unable to earn as much as he earned before the War, he is entitled to apply for an alternative pension under Article 3 of the new Royal Warrant.Mr. Hogge : Can the right hon. Gentleman say how many of the 100 men who have been treated are in this condition, and how many could be treated if you had the accommodation ?Mr. Barnes : I am not able to give the total figure of how many are in this condition, probably 2,000 or 3,000. We are picking them up all the time and ascertaining how many there are. I daresay we have arrangements now on hand for treating 400 or 500.Mr. Hogge: Seeing that the right hon. Gentleman says there are 2,000 or 3,000 of these nerve shock cases, will he expedite arrangements whereby more of them can be accommodated in the Golder&apos;s Green institution, instead of sending them, as many are sent, to lunatic asylums ?Mr. Barnes : I can assure my hon. Friend we are expediting the arrangements as much as we possibly can. We are extremely pressed in regard to other matters as well as this ; but I can assure my hon. Friend we are doing all we can to get as many of these men properly treated as it is possible to do.   I would remindmy hon. Friend that it is only a small proportion can 1 so treated institutionally at the present itme^.Colonel Lord H. Cavendish-Bentinck: Can the rig hon. Gentleman say how many are on the waiting jj at the Golder&apos;s Green institution ?Mr. Barnes: No, I cannot say.Lord H. Cavendish-Bentinck: There are a gre number.Mr. King asked the names of the members of 11 travelling Medical Boards appointed to inquire into tl cases of men invalided through nerve-strain ; how ofh do they sit; can they grant absolute exemption ; hai they power to compel a man back to the Army ; and a they guided in their decision by reference to the opinio of any medical man acquainted with the patient previous history ?Mr. Barnes : There are fifty members of the Sped Medical Board dealing with neurasthenic cases. Tl Board sits at Lancaster Gate daily and at numeroi centres in the provinces once in three weeks or mo frequently if necessary. The fact that a man&apos;s dischar, has been approved by the Board is an absolute exeii, tion under the Review of Exceptions Act. The Boai have, of course, the power to refuse discharge, but ti power is exercised sparingly. They have refused fit cases out of 5,000. They have no power to compel man to re-enter the Army who has been discharge and they are always glad to have, and frequently app for, the opinion of medical men acquainted with tl patienfs previous history. If the hon. Member will s me privately or write me a note, I can get the names f him. I have not, at the moment, got the names of 11 medical men.Mr. King asked what is the proper quarter to whi an ex-soldier can make appeal in respect of hiS ClAVclM when he has been given a half-disability pension, b finds that on attempting to return to work he is qui unable to support himself ?Mr. Barnes: The ex-soldier in the circumstanc referred to by the hon. Member should in the lii instance go to his Local Committee, who, if he requii treatment, will be able to provide it for him and give him an allowance equal to a pension for the Light degree of disability while undergoing it. If he does i; require treatment, the Local Committee will assist ti man in preparing an appeal, supported by any availal medical testimony, to be forwarded to the Secretary the Ministry of Pensions, Royal Hospital, Chelsea.Pensions and Allowances.Sir George Toulmin asked the Pensions Minis! whether he will state the rule by which a pension assessed in favour of the mother of a man in respect whom separation allowance was issued upon his allc ment while alive; whether for the issue of separati allowance the assessed dependency was met by the tot issue of allotment and allowance ; and whether, for t: issue of pension, dependency is assessed by the Govei ment allowance issued upon the allotment ?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry
usions (Colonel Sir A.. Griffith-Boscawen): Article 24 10f the Eoyal Warrant sets forth the meaning of pre-H depeifclence in relation to pensioners. As a rule, e assessment for the purposes of separation allowance accepted for the purposes of pension also. The jount of pension is not assessed according to the ivernment allowance issued upon the allotment, but based upon the full pre-war dependence within the ait of 15s.Jh\ Wing : Are the department taking into considera-)H the probable increase that would have accrued had ose concerned lived instead of being killed ? Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen : No ; that is another ques-m which is.dealt with by another Article I forget the imber in the Boyal Warrant. But the circumstances ,Te been specially taken into account. Sir G. Toulmin asked the Pensions Minister whether, the expiration of any period for which a pension is rarded under the terms of Article 22 (1) of the new oyal Pay Warrant, application may be made by the iVee for continuation or revision; and whether there any 1 imit to the period for which such pension is issuable ? Sir A. Grifuth-Boscawen : The pensions granted under iticle 22 (1) of the Boyal Warrant will be reviewed ltomatically before the expiration of the period for hich they are granted, and will be continued or revised :cording to the circumstances of the claimant at the me of review. These pensions are usually granted for period of one year in the first instance and on subse-lent review.1 Jlr. Hogge asked the Pensions Minister whether he is Irare of the hardship ensuing to dependant parents liider Article 21 of the Warrant; and whether he is Irepared to at least consider the award in all cases of a Mmum payment ?Mr. Barnes : The answer to the first part is in the Brmative. I am carefully watching the working of iticle 21 of the Boyal Warrant with a view to the con-Aeration suggested by the hon. Member.Air. Hogge : If the right hon. Gentleman knows, as he lust know, that the average dependent parent is getting ss than 5s. a week on the death of a son, is he making ay attempt to approach the Treasury to establish a iinimum payment to dependent parents whose sons have een killed in the War ?Mr. Barnes: This matter has been put to the ieasury. It has been sympathetically met by the hancellor, and it is under consideration.Mr. Gilbert asked the Pensions Minister whether he is srare that there are many complaints from men dis-aarged from the Services as to the delay in fixing their elisions ; and whether he can take any steps in order 3 urge his Department to speed up their decisions on all ension cases they have in hand ?Sir. Barnes : I am not aware of any considerable umber of complaints in the direction indicated, but I lay frankly tell the hon. Member that I view with some oucern the unceasing, irregular, and vast growth of the &apos;ork of my Department. Weekly payments have now een authorised to close on 750,000 men, women, andchildren ; the number of &quot;renewals &quot; each month is getting into tens of thousands ; the new arrangements for treatment also involve much careful work in a great number of cases ; and the preparation of cases for the new Appeals Tribunal promises to add still further to the burden. I have a staff of 3,500, consisting nearly entirely of women. None of these had any pre-war experience in the subject, and most of them have a little more than a year&apos;s service. I may say that the majority of cases of real delay are those in which the finding of the medical board on the man&apos;s discharge has not been favourable to him, and inquiries have been set on foot in order to make sure that no element of doubt in his favour has been left unconsidered. The transfer of men from Class W to Class P of the Army Beserve with no time in which to award pension, during which they draw pay, has also resulted in complaints of delay. I need hardly add that both myself and my staff are doing everything we can to obviate delay.Mr. Duncan Millar asked the Pensions Minister whether a new Royal Warrant will shortly be issued providing for the dependants of soldiers killed or incapacitated through service in the South African and other wars ?Mr. Barnes : The issue of a new Warrant for the dependants of soldiers killed or disabled in previous wars is, as I informed the hon. Member for Devizes on July 30th, pw under consideration.Disablement.Mr. Barlow asked the Pensions Minister whether he is aware that inquiries are made at the military hospitals, when examining a man with a view to fixing his disable-ment pension,.as to whether he is working, and, if so, how much he is earning ; whether he is aware that such inquiries are regularly made at the Whitworth Street and other hospitals in the Manchester area ; and whether he will explain why such inquiries are made, in view of the provision of the new Warrant that a man&apos;s eaining capacity is not to be taken into account in assessing his pension ?Mr. Barnes : I hope the hon. Member is referring to circumstances that no longer obtain. My attention, was called some little time ago to the inquiries referred to in the second part of the question, which probably resulted in the use of some obsolete form, and instructions were issued to prevent a recurrence of the irregularity.Mr. Barlow: May I send the right hon. Gentleman &apos; evidence on the point ?Mr. Barnes : Certainly. It may be that inquiries have been made, and there may be some justification for that course.Mr. Hogge : Is it a fact that the only case in which the Medical Board can ask a manias actual earnings is where they are fixing an alternative pension ?Mr. Barnes : That is the only case, and not always then, because there are certain cases examined in which no such inquiry should be made, and if any such case is inquired into it is contrary to the Regulations, and if it is being done we shall have it stopped at once.Mr.  Montague Barlow asked the Pensions Minister
whether, in view of the fact that men permanently .disabled are kept in a state of suspense and forced to undergo repeated medical examinations extending over .long periods of time, discretion will be given to the medical boards to fix a definite period at which a final -examination shall be taken and a man&apos;s case concluded ?Mr. Barnes : In the case of disabled soldiers and -sailors who have specific injuries, the appropriate ^permanent pension is as a rule fixed at the time of dis--charge ; but in the case of men invalided through disease, the permanent pension cannot be fixed until it is seen what course the disease will take. It is impossible to fix a period at the end of which such a man&apos;s final examination will take place, but I am making arrange--ments to reduce the number of re-examinations by -extending pensioners&apos; conditional periods, especially when the degree of disablement is not great.Mr. Hogge : Can the right hon. Gentleman say how much longer than six months ?Mr. Barnes : There is no fixed period. It is sometimes -nine months and sometimes twelve months.Apprentices.Mr. Jowett asked.the Pensions Minister if applications for separation allowance from parents of soldiers who- enlisted during their apprenticeship or whilst they were under training for skilled occupations and in receipt of merely nominal wages, thereby precluding their parents from obtaining separation allowance on the ground of pre-war dependence, have to be made to him ; if so, whether he is aware of the increasing discontent caused by the failure of the Ministry to recognise the sacrifice of . parents in such cases by granting them separation. allowances, as is done in other cases where parents have. not made similar sacrifices for the future welfare of their- sons ; and what action he intends to take in the matter ?Mr. Barnes : The Statutory Committee are empowered -to grant special or supplementary separation allowances : in any case in which a -soldier at the date of his enlistment was undergoing a period of training or apprenticeship at the expiration of which he would have been in a position to contribute to the support of his parents, if  he^&apos;aDsence Q*-       expected contribution had resulted in haii^&quot;p&apos;   ^e Sran*&apos; ^ based on the contribution which the s-&apos;^*er -^sht reasonably have been expected to make outd!^ earninSs at the time of tiie applica-tion-if he had remaiK inJ.^vil .life&apos;  The ^uesfcion of removing the hardship cbiH^on18 under consideration.Employmeu^l&apos;...&apos;&apos;. Mr. Wing asked the Parliamentary ^^tary to the Ministry of Labour how many of the 50,000 i^en V^6-during the year 1916 were placed in the.Army Rt^f.rve&apos; Class W. and Class P., and in -munition works and othJ? work of National Service, and for how many of thenx was civil employment found through the Labomf Bureaux ; if a number of discharged and disal^ed men?&quot; are reluctant to apply for -employment through thei/r fear that they will suffer thereby loss or diminution cJ* their pensions ; and if he will give instructions that f.m*-and clear information shall be given to all disabled with regard to this matter, so that they may not deterred from applying for employment ? V-Mr. Hodge : The number of 50,000, to which the&apos; Member  refers  represents, approximately, the t number of discharged sailors and soldiers placed hi employment by the Employment Exchanges f April, 1915, to the present time.   The exact numbe to the 11th May was 52,724.   The number inclr neither placings of men transferred to an Army Res nor placings of discharged men other than through Employment Exchanges.   I am unable to say how m of the placings could be appropriately described as lie in work of National Service.   A large number of r have been placed in employment upon munitions wo and I may mention that up to the 11th May 9,051 been placed upon work in engineering, and 4,009 u the manufacture of chemicals ;  3,459 in the built&apos; trades or upon the construction of works.   A fun 11,552 were found employment in connection transport work, and 13,599 as general labourers, of \vi a large number are, no doubt, employed upon ur Government work.   Discharged men have been for work in connection with practically every brand industry.   The point raised in the latter part of hon.Member&apos;s question is a matter for the Ministe Pensions, who has caused it to be made widely kn that, once a man&apos;s disability has been determined his pension fixed, no reduction whatever can be on account of anything he may earn.   I understandi further efforts are being made to secure a wide circula of the assurance in question among the men concen.Correspondence.THE FUTURE OF THE VOLUNTARY WOHK --o-To the Editor of the &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot;Sir, Mr. Grundy, in his communication to Gazette for August, touches a question of our cod efforts which is present to the minds of many wlic giving voluntary work for the hurt man and for dependants of those who have gone from us. He how far will the existing organisations continue to i&apos; the State machine with elements of individual syrupy and consideration. ,I venture to think that the answer may be, as lo: we can maintain a system of voluntary help and k checked by a more official and formal supervision, one the nurse in constant attendance, the other doctor prescribing.Nor does it appear to me that the difficulty of r taining the curious, but so far able, admixture of vt tary kindliness and departmental brake is great. 1 I feel sure, by no means insuperable. The ehthus which is the present mainspring oi effort, may remain so highly strung, but the feeling of useful: which kept the old.organisations in existence under pressing circumstances, is not likely to prove fe
er the strain of the greatest trial the country has ;ed in its history. The trial has braced us. The experience of the Sub-Local Committee with oich I am associated has proved satisfactory, both as its machinery for dealing with individual cases by dividual workers and as to business efficiency in detail mist-ration. So far, perhaps I should say as we ay judge, who are critics of our own work, and may be, iome extent, prejudiced. We are, as are others, a iect descendant of a Local Representative Committee, d related to the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families Asso-jtion and the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society. On s Committee we have had members&apos; of the District inncil, of the Board of Guardians, clergymen, ministers, Ivation Army representatives, a local relieving officer the Poor Law, Labour representatives, an army iicer, parish workers (ladies), and men and ladies of dependent means and with spare time. The Clerk the Council acts as hon. secretary. The Council has ren accommodation. The public hall doctor and the Irish nurse, and the school attendance officers have reh help whenever asked for it. The collaboration [so many elements has proved most effective. Here we have an association of practically all the :al forces, supported by the local administrative body, ., the District Council, and in this direction will, I pe, be the action of the future, in the years when the citement of actual war is over and the work of admin-ration becomes comparatively monotonous. I hope see a continuation of a Voluntary Committee, upon jhich the local authority should be represented, and to pich it should have power of appointment. Of the possibility of obtaining voluntary workers I ve not much doubt. There is a strong basis of it in ting organisations. The policy of bringing together presentatives of those organisations for a common \ iject has been extraordinarily successful, and so long that object is clearly defined as to its work, and the jtcessity for it, there will, I feel confident, be little Jill ficulty in obtaining the services of the many men and omen who are desirous of helping others, but do not jlsily find an outlet for their activities. If we - can P tain that combination of voluntary help we may be *p irly sure that its attitude will be sympathetic and p adly to the individual, and that that attitude will 4b aterially affect the whole machinery of administration. Yours, etc.,C. J. ANDERSON,Chairman, Chiswick sub-Local Committee, for Naval and Military Pensions.Questions and Answers.iai i...........-)fu -   &apos;if&apos; A letter has been received from a Scottish firm of ifij amifacturers stating that they have openings in a etling mill for which men suffering from total deafness aej wld be suitable.

Is there any difference between second corporal and lance-corporal, or are they alternate terms for same rank ? If not, under what class do they come for pensions for widows ?A. A second corporal is a non-commissioned officer Class IV., whereas a lance-corporal ranks as a private.Q. 30. In cases of soldiers&apos; wives with sons serving, where the allowance is given in respect of a child, is the dependence assessed as if it were for the woman or as the dependence of that child on the soldier 1A. The household dependence on the soldier son is substituted for the dependence of the child on its father, where this would be to the advantage of the family.Q. 31.-Regulation 13 (a), Clause 47 of Part II. Is it permissible tvhere there are tvjo or more children ill in a family, for a grant to be made under this regulation, not exceeding 5s. per week each case, e.g., wife and one child, sickness grant of 10s. per week, subject to medical evidence. Three children in same family, grant of 15s. per week.A. The Statutory Committee are prepared to con-sider specially any case in which a grant of 5s. a week is insufficient owing to the fact that more than one member of the family is ill at the same time. Full par-ticulars should be submitted with the recommendation of the Local Committee.Q. 32. Regulation 9 (a), Part II. Instruction No. 38 lays down that in post-war cases &quot; the minimum allotment of 3s. Qd. is required as a test of the man&apos;s acceptance of the responsibility for the support of the family.&quot; Is 3s. 6d. the minimum for all ranks 1 Or must a sergeant allot 5s. IQd. before an alloivance can be made under this regulation ?A. A man is required to make an allotment reason-.ably proportionate to his pay; 3s. Gd. is the reasonable amount for a private soldier in an infantry regiment, but for higher ranks, and in the case of specially paid corps, this amount is insufficient. The Statutory Committee have decided that an allotment of less than half pay cannot be regarded as a reasonable contribution for the purposes of this regulation. If there is any difficulty in ascertaining the amount of a man&apos;s pay, the Statutory Committee will obtain the necessary information.Q. 33. A wife has a liability of  15 per annum io pay on account of rent, rates, mortgage, Insurances, etc. All she receives is 12s. Qd. per week separation allowance. She is earning  60 a year as a teacher and consequently the Civil Liabilities Commissioner will not allow a grant. Are we in order in alloiding her assistance to meet her husband&apos;s liabilities under Regulation 7 (1) (d) or any other regulation in Part II. iA. Regulation 7 (1) (d) does not apply as the woman is in employment.   It is suggested that particulars of
the case&apos;should be forwarded to the Statutory Com-mittee.Q. 34. Can advances be made to a man in Class P, drawing a temporary allowance of 14s. per week with a wife and child to support ? He is unable to work and insurance payments are delayed, though medical certificates pre supplied every week ?A. The Local Committee should refer the case to Chelsea with a view to claiming a pension for the man.Q. 35. Will you please advise what is the position of motherless children in regard to the increase in the allow-ance for children of January last in the following circum-stances: Four children two in the care of one person, a third in the care of a second person, and the fourth in the care of a third guardian. Is each child entitled to the maximum addition of 2s., or are they taken collectively, and is the increase issued according to the scale just as if they were with a mother. If the latter, to whom would the higher allowance be paid, the person in charge of the elder children or the younger ?A. The separation allowance payable in this case, if the children are all under fourteen, should be 13s. a week for the two in charge of one person, and 7s. a week for each of the two remaining children who are separately boarded out. The facts should be reported to the Paymaster if the correct amount is not being paid.Q. 36. A man discharged from the Army on account of disability arising from wounds received on active service, being exempt on that account from further military service and receiving a permanent partial disability pension elects to rejoin the Army. Does his pension continue payable during his service ? (a) Is there any difference if the pension be not permanent but for a definite time and subject thereafter to the finding of a Medical Board 1 (b) Is the continuation or otherwise of the pension affected by the particular medical category in which the man is placed on re-enlislmeni ? (c) How far is the question affected if the man be discharged under circumstances entitling him to a pension but not to exemption frcm^further military service tA. The position of soldiers in receipt of permanent or temporary disablement pensions who are recalled to service under the Military Service (Review of Excep-tions) Act, or voluntarily reTenlist, is clearly explained in Army Council Instruction 1131, dated the 19th July, 1917.   Printed elsewhere in this issue.Q. 37. A Disablement Sub-Committee frequently quires to be furnished with medical reports wdischar men. Should application for these be made tdihe hosp-&apos; from which the man was discharged ? When should i information be asked for from the Special Travell Medical Board and when from the Royal Hosir Chelsea ?A. The documents of all soldiers discharged medically unfit for further service are forwarded Chelsea for consideration as regards pension and&quot; custody two or three weeks before the date of I discharge, and any enquiries for copies of or extra from medical reports should, therefore, be addressed the Ministry of Pensions, Royal Hospital, Chelsea.Q. 38. Is there no regulation under which a soldi wife who is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis can assisted ? According to the ruling of the Statutory Co mittee Regulations, 13 (a) is only intended to apply to co of temporary serious illness. - In the case in question th are two children-, and the separation allowance is&apos; gi inadequate to provide the wife with the nourishing food requires 1A. If the applicant can show that there is disprq tion between her actual pre-war income and pits income (taking separation allowance at the rates exist before the revision in January last), a recommendal should be made under Regulation 7 (2). Contiu allowances cannot be made under Part II. Regulati unless disproportion of income exists.Q. 39. Cases have arisen where Pensions Commit agree with the War Pensions Local Committee that Pensions Officer has assessed dependence at loo hi figure. On appeal the matter has been referred bad the Pensions Officer who, in most cases, confirms original finding and no alteration is made. If a Pcm Sub-Committee and the War Pensions Local Comm adhere&apos;to their opinion that the Pensions Officer is it will the Ministry of Pensions accept their joint rccmm dation as to the correct assessment for the purpose of sin mentary and special separation allowances noiwithsian the working of Instruction 27, Part II. ?A.

APPENDIX   VI.MINISTRY OP JM5I0NS -0gSecretary&apos;s Offffice,Westminster House,Millbfthk,London.   S * 7?. 1 *2Sth August 19X71De-ar SisThe Hinlsterfs attention has been called tOvtho fact that in connection with the treatment of disabled men. in, auxiliary and civil hospitals, a question has been raised by the British Medical Association as to the payment of medical m3n giving their services in these hospitals.correspondence which has passed between Sir Eicbjnan Godlee and the Ministry on tho point.Tfhatever may be the merits of the suggestion for payment in respect of tho services of the medical staff of hospitals as distinct from that of payment for the maintenance of patients, the question is, in the Minister^ judgment, not one which ought to be allowed to complicate the immediate matter to be arranged for, namely, the treatment of men on discharge *    The following are the general grounds on which thit vievz is based:-(a) The treatment provided for in tho Instructions is only such as has in the pact been  ivon by the Statutory Committee and no question has previously been raised.(b) The special treatment to be provided is limited by the Royal Warrant and Instructions to treatment necessitated by injury or disease which constitutesor is due to, the man^ disablement.    In other word!, it is not any and every disease or injury which can be given institutional treatment at the expense of the St atef but only the injury or diaoasy which has been officially recognised as having; led to the manUI enclose for your information copies ct
131diftc&amp;^e freui Service.(c) Such special treatment will in tho l:;rge majority of cases cease to be required within at moet ayear after the man!s discharge, and in oases of loss of limb it will rarely he found to be required after perhaps a month or tv/o after discharge *(d) The total number of cases needing special treatment at all will bo relatively small *    A special enquiry conducted at Leeds showed that not more than J20  ot the men discharged needed any further treatment than their panel doctor could give them.(e) The arrangements for payment embodied in the Instructions are those which obtain in other Departments and with local authorities who have to send patients to hospitalsi     ?or the Ministry to alter the basis of payment for ex-scldior patients would be to upset these other arrangementsi(f) The civil hospitals have always been understood to be voluntary institutions; and as such they have been free of public responsibility and controlsIf the services of the staff as well as the cost of the patient is to be charged for in all cases sent by public bodies, it will lead inevitably to the question of public inspection and control, which the hospitals and their subscribers have always resisted.(g) Any arrangements rr^ade no?? on the lines of the Instructions v/ould not be allowed to prejudice the-general question raised by the British helical Association.    This has been definitely promised by the ^sinister in ? reply given to the North &amp;t?.ffordshiro Infirmary, and you are authorised to
t 3 9 i. 0 iCrepeat it.    The general question involves, however, so many considerations that it could not be adequately considered now without interfering with the treatment of the disabled men and this would be disastrous, (h) A settlement of the general question raised by the Association would involve(i) either a separate bargain with each hospital or a uniform bargain.    An arrangement for uniform terras of radical remuneration everywhere could not be made because there is no central body representing all the hospitals of the kingdom through whoa it could be negotiated, corresponding to the British iie&amp;ical Association, (ii) disagreement with a large number of thespecialists and doctors attending the civil hospitals, many of vfhom are opposed to payment and prefer that it should be understood that they siv$ their services voluntarily *     This was clearly indicated at the meeting of the I:.edical Advisory Ccmrr.ittee which was con- ened by Ur. Barnes to consider the- Instructions, (iii) determining which of the Doctors on the hospital staff should be paid,     Uhould there be a coi-ranon fund for the medical staff or should the individual doctor attending the patient be paid ? If the latter, the extent of the cervices rendered e.g*, by the operating surgeon and by the house physician would have to be estimatedi (iv) discrimination between the &quot;non-paid for&quot; and the i::%ri.id for&quot; patients which would probably be resented.    It would certainly be suspected that the&quot;paid for&quot; patients, if the payment includedspecific
specific remuneration for the doctor, mi$ht begetting better attention.Xn all these circuus^nces it v/ill be very detrimental to tho success of treatment for disabled men if the question is so far pressed at the present time as to lead to any refusal to give treatment on the part of the hoepltalg.    If the question is raised at the meetings of the Joint Committees or of Local Co.v/.dtteea or in the oourse of any negotiations conducted by you with hospitals, please represent the matter in the light of wht.t is said s^ove and emphasise particularly paragraphs numbered (f), (r:) and (h)*ITours very truly,

APPENDIX   XI. A. MINISTRY OF LABOUR-EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT.advisory wages boards for disabledsailors and soldiers.EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM.Advisory Wages Boards for disabled sailors aud soldiers are being formed by the Ministry of Labour, at the request of the War Pensions, etc., Statutory Committee, in order to supply machinery for obtaining an authoritative opinion as to* the rate of wages which should be paid to any individual disabled man in respect of specific employment. The Boards may also be asked by the Ministry of Pensions or by a local War Pensions Committee to advise as to the earning capacity of disabled men. The oonstitu-tiou and proposed working- of the Boards are described in the following paragraphs.(1) The Ministry of Labour have formed panels of repre-sentative employers and workmen in certain defined areas in order (o supply members to sit upon the Advisory Wages Boards.(2) The representatives appointed upon the panels will hold office for such period, not being less than twelve months from the first meeting of the Board after the appointment of the repre-sentatives, as the Minister of Labour may determine.(3) A Board will consist of the permanent Chairman or his deputy (in either case appointed by the Ministry of Labour), silting with one representative of employers and one representa-tive of workmen, drawn from the panels of employers&apos; repre-sehtatives and workmen&apos;s representatives, respectively, which have been formed for the purpose. With these Boards will sit, as assessors, representatives of the local War Pensions Com-mittees.(4) The representatives of employers and workmen will, so far as practicable, be summoned to serve in turn at meetings of the Boards. A rota of members will be prepared and supplied to all members of the panels. Subject to the special arrangement described in paragraph 20, a Board will be constituted when the Chairman is present together with one representative of employers and one representative of workmen drawn from the panel. If a representative, who has been summoned to attend, fails to do so, the Clerk to the Board may secure in his place the attendance of another member drawn from the panel upon which the name of the absent member appears. Should the Chairman consider it expedient that, at any particular meeting of the Board, certain individual representatives upon the panel should be present as members of the Boai&apos;d. he may instruct the Clerk to summon such members in addition to the Wo representatives next upon the rota for attendance. Such additional members of the Board must, however, he drawn in equal numbers from the employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s panels; and, in the event of the failure of any such additional member after summons to attend the meeting of the Board, his place must be filled by the attendance of another(11545-14a.)   Wt. 11182-a 89.   5000.   6/17.   D &amp; S.   (J. 4.
member drawn from the panel upon which the name of the absent member appears. V(5) The Clerk to the Board will, when issuing summonses to members of the panels, communicate with any local War Pensions Committee within whose area a workman, whose case is to be heard by the Board at that meeting, resides, inviting the committee to arrange for the attendance of one of their members as an assessor at the meeting of the Board.(6) An officer of the Ministry of Labour will be attached to each Advisory Wages Board to act as Clerk to the Board. This officer will be responsible, subject to the general instructions of the Ministry of Labour and to the direction of the Chairman, for arranging the rota, for summoning members, assessors and witnesses to attend sittings of the Board, for bringing cases before the Board, and for keeping the records of the Board.(7) It is anticipated that each Board will arrange for periodical meetings at fixed intervals according to the volume of work anticipated. Supplementary meetings may, however, be held at any time as the work to be done requires.(8) A definite area is assigned to each Advisory Wages Board, and the Board will deal with all cases in which, its advice is sought provided that the employment, in respect of which reference is made to the Hoard, is situated within its area.(!)) Any employer or workman directly interested in the matter, or the secretary of the local War Pensions Committee for the area in which the workman resides, may apply to the Board for advice as to the wages whicli should be paid to a workman already engaged, or to be engaged, upon specific work; or a local War Pensions Committee may apply for advice as to the earning capacity of any ex-soldier or ex-sailor resident in their area.(10) Any person who desires to obtain the advice of the Board will make-formal application to have the matter brought before the Board upon a form to be obtained at the offices of any local War Pensions Committee, or at any Employment Exchange. The application, when completed, will be sent to the Clerk to the appropriate Board.(11) Upon receipt of an application for advice, the Clerk to the Board will confer with the Chairman of the Board as to the evidence to he obtained, and as to the witnesses who should he summoned to the hearing of the case. The Clerk will, subject to the Chairman&apos;s instructions, make such preliminary enquiries as are necessary in order to present the case for the consideration of the Board, and lie will prepare a summary of the case and of any reports received in connection therewith. Should the Chairman lie of opinion that the cases whicli are to be brought before, the Board cannot, he dealt with satisfactorily without the attendance of a medical practitioner, he may instruct the Clerk to summon as an assessor at the meeting of the Board any fully-qualified medical practitioner whom he may indicate. It is anticipated, however, that it will not&quot; as a rule be necessary to arrange for the attendance of a medical assessor, as the local War Pensions Com-mittees will, it is hoped, be willing to supply the Board with the
medical history of the men upon whose cases the Board&apos;s advice is bting sought.(12) Wherever practicable, forty-eight hours&apos; notice of the hearing of a case will be given by the Clerk to the workman and employer concerned, and to any other parties directly interested in the case.(13) The sittings of the Board will not he open to the general public.(14) Any workman upon whose case the Board&apos;s advice is being-sought may be represented by any person duly authorised thereto by him, not being Counsel.(15) The members of the Board, including the assessors, may if they so desire retire to discuss their decision in private.(16) The Chairman will instruct the Clerk to summon certain witnesses to attend a meeting of the Board, and any party to a case may bring such witnesses as he thinks fit. Witnesses summoned by the Clerk, and witnesses whose evidence the Chair-man considers has been material to the case, will be entitled to receive remuneration for lost time in accordance with the authorised scale.(17) In considering the advice to be given in any case brought before them, the Board will not have regard to any pensions to which the workman concerned is entitled at the time of application or to any pension to which he may become entitled thereafter.(18) The decision of the majority of the members of the Board (including the Chairman but excluding assessors) will be the decision of the Board. Any member of the Board, or any of the assessors may, however, express in writing his dissent from tho decision of the Board and such expression of dissent shall form an integral part of the Board&apos;s decision.(19) The decision of the Board will be communicated by the Clerk to the employer and workman concerned, and also to the local War Pensions Committee if that committee is directly interested in the case. A copy of the decision will also be com-municated confidentially to the Ministry of Labour in order that particulars (which will not reveal the individuals concerned) of important cases may be circulated to the various Advisory Wages Boards for their guidance and information.(20) Upon receipt of notice that a case will be brought before an Advisory Wages Board, the employer and workman con-cerned may, if they so desire, make a formal request to the Cleric to the Board that the case shall be heard by the Chairman of the Board sitting without other members of the Board. When such an application is received both from the employer and from the workman concerned in any case, the case will be heard by the Chairman alone, except that if the Chairman considers that the presence of a medical assessor or a representative of the local War Pensions Committee concerned is essential to the hearing of the case he may cause such an assessor or assessors to be summoned.

Thebusiness of these Committees is to advise the Ministry of Tensions SB to the conditions under which the training of disabled men in various trades can best be given, the best methods of trainings the suitable centres far it and generally to secure uniformity in the training.Boot and Shoe Manufacture,   Wednesday, 29th August 1917. There are ever 100 different processes in boct md shoe manufacture and the Committee went carefully through these and selected a small number Thich they thought likely to be specially suitable for dia* abled men and they also agreed upon the length of training for each process * only in hand-clicking was 12 months suggested the rest varied from 6 months to 2.    In all the proceises except three or four it was agreed that the training would have to be given in factories or wcrkshpps and not in a technical school.    A very difficult point was then discussed as to the&quot;amount that employers should contribute in wages to the mon during the period of trains ing in consideration of the services performed by them during the period of training.   It was finally agreed to refer this for local consideration as it would be important to carry local employers on this point.

APPENDIX V.233Memorandum   ,   1.0.National health insurance.Medical and Sanatorium Benefits of Invalided Seamen, Marines and Soldiers.Part I.  INTRODUCTORY.AMENDING 1917 ACT.1. Section 4 of the National Insurance (Part 1 Amendment) Act, 1917, recently enacted, provides as follows : &apos;&quot;&apos; 4. Regulations of the Insurance Commissioners may provide that any man discharged from service as a seaman, . marine or soldier who is certified by the Admiralty or Army Council to be suffering from any disease or bodily or mental disablement in the manner provided by Section one of the National Insurance (Navy and Army) Act, 1914, (Session 2), and who, by reason of his having elected not to pay contribu-tions during the period of his service, or for any other reason, is not qualified under the National Insurance Act, 1911, to receive benefits out of the Navy and Army Insurance Fund shall, subject to the prescribed conditions, become or continue to be entitled out of thai fund to medical and sanatorium benefits.&quot;2. This power of granting medical and sanatorium benefits to invalided sailors and soldiers not otherwise qualified to receive them has been obtained by the Commissioners in accordance with the wishes of the Minister of Pensions, who is charged, with certain general functions under the recent Royal Pensions Warrant and Order in Council and the Naval and Military War Pensions, etc. (Transfer of Powers) Act, 1917, in connection with the pro-vision of medical treatment for invalided sailors and soldiers. In pursuance of these functions the Minister of Pensions has requested the Commissioners to extend the provisions of their existing medical sendees so as to cover the-small class of invalided men who, though coming within the purview of the Ministry, have not hitherto been eligible for the benefits of National Health Insur-ance : and as a result of consultation between the Departments, the Commissioners have made Regulations under the Section above quoted, extending medical and sanatorium benefits to all invalided uninsured sailors and soldiers whose income from all sources does not exceed  100 a year. A copy of these Regulations accompanies this memorandum. (331788)  Wt. 18498-7932.   7500.   8/17.   Sir J. C. &amp; S.   Gp. 33.
3. Under the existing Acts and Regulations, therefore, medical and sanatorium benefits will be available for all invalided sapors and soldiers without distinction, saving only those uninsured men whose income exceeds  160 per annum. Thus invalided sailors and soldiers constitute a somewhat special class, whose eligibility for these benefits does not depend, as in the case of other persons, upon their status in insurance.4. The special status of this class has rendered it possible to adopt the highly desirable course of instituting automatic procedure whereby, on or before discharge, invalided men may be provided with a means of immediately selecting a doctor, etc., without having either to await the issue of a Medical Card by the Committee upon receipt of the Reinstatement Slip from the Approved Society, or to take the initiative themselves by making application to the Insurance Committee. Arrangements have accordingly been made, as will be seen below, for the Pensions Ministry to issue to each sailor or soldier about to be invalided a form which he can complete and present to the doctor of his choice, and upon presentation of which the doctor can, on the strength of its production and of the statements which it contains, proceed forthwith to afford treatment.SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR REMUNERATION OFPRACTITIONERS.5. But as regards the new class now created of invalided sailors and soldiers entitled to medical,benefit, it has been found necessary to apply certain special arrangements for entirely different reasons. The medical profession have for some considerable time expressed dissatisfaction at pajoncnt being made for the treatment of invalided men on the terms applicable in the case of the ordinary insured population; and it has been submitted on their behalf that an excessive burden of liability to afford treatment, not contemplated by the terms of the original bargain with the profession, lias been cast upon panel practitioners by the invaliding from service in a broken con-dition of men who but for their service would have made comparatively little or no claim upon the doctor&apos;s time and skill.6. Various considerations, however, enter into the question which must necessarily qualify any inferences, based upon the physical condition of invalided men as a class, as to the extent, if any, to which they involve an excessive demand upon the time and services of practitioners. No data have been put forward or are at present otherwise available in support of any such inferences ; and in the absence of evidence it is not, of course, possible for the contention of the profession to be definitely accepted. It must be admitted, however, that the position is exceptional with regard to these men ; and the Com-missioners have accordingly, with the consent of the Treasury,
agreed to meet the representations of the profession in a manner wbilh. will afford an automatic solution of the question at issue, and at the same time convey to the practitioners affording treat-ment to invalided men whatever extra remuneration is demon-strated, as a result, to be due.7. The only possible method of securing these objects is by means of the payment per attendance basis. It is proposed that practitioners should be paid per attendance for their actual services rendered to invalided men, accounts being calculated on the scale in force as regards temporary residents (subject to the slight extension shown in the scale included in the Regula-tions), and payment being made at the dividend rate found to be payable on that scale out of the Central Medical Benefit Fund for the year. A special fund will be constituted into which will be paid the sum of 9s. per head available in respect of each in-valided man treated on the attendance basis, supplemented, so far as proves to be necessary, by an Exchequer grant.8. The accounts of doctors in respect of the invalided men will be paid at the temporal resident dividend rate out of this fund ; and they will thus receive what may be regarded as the Insurance rate of remuneration for whatever services they are required to render. Should it prove that the sums of 9s. per head carried to the fund are insufficient to meet the charges upon it, Exchequer funds will be forthcoming to supply the deficiency ; and the doctors will in that event, therefore, automatically receive an extra amount representing the equivalent, at the Insurance rate of remuneration per service, of whatever extra burden of professional services their responsibility for the treatment of invalided men has imposed upon them.9. The case of the medical profession applies to all invalided men as a class, including those already invalided from service, as well as any who may be invalided in the future ; and the Commissioners would have preferred to place all invalided men, without exception, upon the new attendance basis. But in the case of men already invalided, the practical difficulties of identifica-tion render it necessary to modify this arrangement. A great number of these men are, of course, already included in the lists of practitioners on the ordinary capitation basis, and must obviously be removed from those lists before payment per attend-ance can be made for their treatment. The absence of precise particulars renders it impossible, however, to remove such men from the doctor&apos;s lists exhaustively ; while to attempt to carry out this undertaking in any less thorough manner would create inequity and hardship&apos;.10. It has been found necessary, therefore, to distinguish (a) those invalided men who are already included in doctor&apos;s lists at a capitation rate, or may hereafter by accident become so included, and (6) those men invalided hereafter to whom the special automatic procedure for the selection of doctors (see paragraph 37) can be applied.
11. As regards class (6) all such men will be treated under^the new payment per attendance arrangements without exception. As regards class (a) the doctor will be allowed an option as to whether he will have any individual invalided man placed upon the new basis or will retain him as a capitation patient.12. To minimise the tendency towards an unfavourable selection against the special fund which might otherwise operate, it is provided that, where a doctor gives notice to the Committee that he desires a given invalided man included in his list to be admitted to the new arrangements, these arrangements shall not take effect in respect of the man until the beginning of the quarter following that in wliich the notice is received, the doctor being left in the meantime to afford treatment at the capitation rate of payment. But when under the optional transfer pro-cedure, an invalided man has been admitted to the attendance basis arrangements, he will continue to be dealt with on that basis, notwithstanding any subsequent removals or changes of doctor. The procedure has accordingly been framed so as to preclude his reverting to the position of a capitation patient.13. It should be understood that the special arrangements are of the nature of emergency arrangements, the exceptional character of which has been dictated by the difficulties of the present abnormal conditions. They should be regarded as cx-perimental and liable to reconsideration at any time.IDENTIFICATION OF INVALIDED MEN.14. In connection with the special arrangements it is necessary to emphasise that they apply only to men invalided from the Forces. The arrangements do not apply to men discharged but not invalided. For the guidance of Committees on this point, it may bo explained that, with negligible exceptions, every invalided man has on his discharge paper the statement that he was discharged as &quot; no longer physically fit for war service.&quot;ADMISSION  OF PRACTITIONERS NOT  ON PANEL.15. One other change deserving special notice has been instituted by the Commissioners at the request of the medical profession, who have expressed a desire that it should be open to practitioners not already on the panel to undertake the treat-ment of invalided men without thereby accepting responsibility for the treatment of other classes of persons entitled to medical benefit. In deference to these wishes the Commissioners have made provision whereby a practitioner not already under agree-ment with the Insurance Committee may enter into a special form of agreement. Under the special agreement the doctor will be entitled to accept for treatment any invalided men making application to him under the special procedure, and to receive remuneration in accordance with the special payment per atten-dance arrangements, but will not be entitled to accept any other insured persons, nor liable to have any persons, whether invalided
1men- or others, allotted to him. In all other respects, however, the-special agreement will impose the same terms and conditions of service as are imposed by the ordinary full panel-service agreement.REGULATIONS.16. Regulations have accordingly been made by the Com-missioners providing, so far as is necessary, for the arrangements previously described. A copy accompanies this memorandum. It will be noted that Article 3 requires the adoption by the Committee of a special procedure satisfactory to the Com-missioners for application by invalided men for acceptance by practitioners, etc. The detailed procedure which should be followed by Insurance Committees and which will satisfy the requirements of the Regulations, in that and other respects, is described in the ensuing Part II. of this memorandum.FORM OF ACCOUNT.17. Provision has been inserted in the Regulations (at the request of the profession) that the accounts of the services ren-dered upon the attendance basis to invalided men should be furnished by doctors quarterly instead of at any longer intervals. It will be seen that the special account form which accompanies this memorandum is framed with this object. In this connection it has seemed highly desirable to the Commissioners, both for general reasons as well as for the assistance of the Pensions Ministry in the discharge of their own special functions, that there should be available some continuous record of the nature of the illnesses of individual invalided men. With a view to securing this valuable object it has accordingly been prescribed that the account, when submitted at the end of each quarter, should include a statement by the doctor of the nature of the illness or illnesses for which treatment has been given.PROVISION OF SPECIAL MEDICAL SERVICES BYWAR PENSIONS COMMITTEES.18. The form of account alluded to will, of course, be in the possession of every doctor attending invalided soldiers under the new arrangements ; and advantage has been taken of this fact to utilise the back of the form so as to serve a useful purpose of another kind.19. Insurance Committees will bear in mind that Article 3 of the Medical Benefit Regulations, 1916 (No. 2) (page 392 in the volume of Collected Statutes, Regulations and Orders) lays upon a practitioner certain duties in the case of a patient who in his opinion requires specialist, etc. services and for whom such services are available under arrangements made by a public authority, etc. As stated in Memorandum 227 /I.C. (paragraph 4) this provision was primarily occasioned by the necessity for co-ordinating the   Insurance  medical  service  with the special
medical services then, in contemplation for disabled sailors and soldiers.20. The recent issue by the Pensions Ministry of Instructions to local War Pensions Committees on the Treatment and Training of Disabled Men has now made it possible for War Pensions Committees to proceed with their arrangements for the provision of special treatment in the case of men needing such treatment for the disease or disabling on account of which they were in-valided. Insurance Committees will appreciate the importance of-getting into touch with War Pensions Committees on the subject and of taking any necessary steps to ascertain whether the condi-tions precedent to advantage being taken of Article 3 have been observed in the framing of those arrangements. They will doubt-less also make it their business to ascertain the character and extent of the local War Pensions Committee&apos;s arrangements, in order that they may be able to keep practitioners properly in-formed as to the available facilities, and to assist them to make use of those facilities in the interests of their invalided ex-service patients.21. The essential piece of machinery for the purpose of the necessary co-ordination between the two services is naturally, however, that which enables the practitioner to refer a patient needing special services to the proper quarter, and to intimate, in so doing, for the guidance of the authority or officer charged with the duty of arranging for the appropriate special treatment, his views as to the patient&apos;s needs and condition as ascertained by him in the course of his attendance. This can most conve-niently be done by means of a form of medical report.22. Por the convenience of doctors, therefore, and in order that a suitable form for the purpose may be readily accessible to them, the Commissioners have arranged for the back of the account form referred to in paragraph 17 to serve as a form of medical report.   Whenever a practitioner under the Insurance Acts in the course of his attendance upon an invalided man arrives at the conclusion that the patienfs condition needs treat-ment which he is not required hy his agreement to give, but which is available under the arrangements of the local War Pensions Committee, it will be open to him to make use, for the purpose of the necessary reference to the proper quarter, of the report form printed on the reverse of the form of account; and, where the patient is one in respect of whom he is being remunerated on the attendance basis, he will be at liberty to claim the appropriate fee in respect of that service. Where he is being remunerated on the capitation basis, no claim can, of course, be made, as his remunera-tion in respect of all his patients, well and ill, must be deemed to cover the liability to perform such a service when required.
.   Part II. MEDICAL   BENEFIT Classification of Cases.23. As previously seen, there are two forms of special pro-cedure covering all cases of invalided men, viz., that in which the attendance basis is optional and that in which it is obligatory. Similarly, all invalided men fall into two distinct classes, the inclusion of a particular individual in one or the other class determining which is the appropriate form of the arrangements in his case.24. First, as regards the class which is subject to the optional transfer procedure, it will be borne in mind that this form of procedure applies primarily to those invalided men who have, prior to the institution of these new arrangements, become included as ordinary capitation patients in a doctors&apos; bst. Cases might occur, however, in which men hereafter invalided become included as ordinary capitation patients on doctors&apos; lists through accident, or omission to disclose the fact that they are invalided sailors or soldiers ; and the optional transfer procedure would extend to such cases also.25. In all other cases the attendance basis will be obligatory. It will be apparent, if the characteristics of this latter class are examined, that it consists of those invalided men who make application for acceptance by or assignment to doctors, etc., in a manner which discloses the fact that they are invalided sailors or soldiers. The normal method of making such application will be by means of the special form which will in future be supplied by the Pensions Ministry to all men invalided hereafter ; and hence the great majority of the men in this class will be the men who are invalided after the inception of these new arrange-ments. But just as the optional transfer class, though primarily applying to past invahdings, may include some future invalidings, so the class in which the attendance basis is obligatory will also comprise some men already invalided who may, upon a future application to the Committee or a doctor, happen to disclose the fact that they are invalided men.26. Thus, the class in which the attendance basis is obligatory will mainly correspond with the class of men who are invalided after the inception of these arrangements, since such men, having been furnished by the Pensions Ministry with a special form of application to a doctor will, in presenting such form, thereby give notice to the doctor and Insurance Committee that they are invalided sailors or soldiers. For this reason this class of men is described in the subsequent paragraphs on pro-cedure as &quot; New Cases.&quot; Similarly, the optional transfer class (described below for convenience as &quot; Transfer Cases &quot;) will mainly correspond with the class of men who were invalided prior to the inception of the new arrangements, since the majority
of them are already included in a doctor&apos;s list. But as already, seen, some men already invalided will become &quot; New Cases,&quot; while some men hereafter invalided might become &quot; Transfer Cases.&quot;27. Broadly spealdng, the new system aims at placing upon the attendance basis without any option all men hereafter selecting a doctor, etc., who are known at the time of selection to be in-valided men. Neither form of special procedure can, of course, in any event be applied in the absence of knowledge that a man has been invalided from service. Men in whose case such infor-mation is not for any reason forthcoming will presumably avail themselves of the ordinary medical benefit procedure, and, in so doing, will be indistinguishable from any ordinary insured person. Leaving out of account this class, we have accordingly two main classes affected by the new arrangements A. &quot;New Cases.&quot;B. &quot; Transfer Cases.&quot; The procedure appropriate to each is dealt with in a separate section below.Finance.28. &quot; New Cases &quot; will consist of both insured and uninsured cases.   &quot;Transfer Cases&quot; will include insured cases only.29. The financial arrangements as regards both New Cases and Transfer Cases admitted to the attendance basis will be as follows. The cost of treatment will be charged upon the special fund to be created, viz., the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund. This Fund will be primarily fed with the sums of 9s. per head per annum, available in respect of the individuals admitted.30. In uninsured cases payment will be made to the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund from the Navy and Army Insurance Fund at the rate of 8s. Gd. per annum.31. In insured cases payment will be made to the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund at the rate of 8s. Gd. per annum, out of the General Medical Benefit Fund, to which all sums available for their medical benefit will have already been carried. The Index Register count of the Committee for the purpose of their credit out of the latter Fund will be reduced by the total number of the invalided men receiving treatment in the Committee&apos;s area under the new arrangements.32. It is not proposed to credit the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund in respect of any invalided men until their actual admission to the attendance basis arrangements. In New Cases, however, it will frequently occur that an interval will elapse between the man&apos;s discharge and his selection of a doctor which gives rise to his admission to the attendance basis. The sum available in respect of this interval is, however, due to the Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund, which has been subject to risk during the interven-ing period ; and arrangements have been made in such cases to credit this Fund with the arrears.
, i33. In the case of uninsured men, the Navy and Army Insur-arice Fund will be debited with the arrears as from the date of discharge to the date of admission to the attendance basis (as well as for the subsequent period) at the rate of 85. Gd. per annum. In the case of insured men, a similar back-debit at the rate of 8s. 6d. per annum will be made to the General Medical Benefit Fund. No corresponding reduction will, however, be made in the Committee&apos;s Index Register count.34. The Invalided Soldiers&apos; Medical Fund will also be credited, on corresponding lines, with the &quot; domiciliary &quot; sixpence either out of the General Sanatorium Benefit Fund or, in the case of uninsured men and insured members of the Navy and Army Insurance Fund, from that Fund direct. The sums due in respect of the period after admission to the attendance basis will be appropriated in reduction of the amounts which would otherwise have been payable to the Insurance Committee in whose area the man is receiving treatment under the special arrangements.Medicines, ete.35. If the patient resides in a district where medicines, etc., are obtained through a chemist, the doctor will prescribe on the usual form as though for an ordinary insured person. The prescription form need not be specially marked unless the services are in connection with the domiciliary treatment of a man recom-mended for sanatorium benefit, in which case the form should be marked as in the case of other patients receiving domiciliary treatment. If the patient resides in a district where the doctor, under arrangements with the Insurance Committee, himself supplies medicines, etc., to his ordinary insured patients, any medicines, etc., will be supplied by the doctor. He will, of course, be entitled to an additional payment under this head, and where so desired the Commissioners will be prepared to approve of payment being made at a flat rate per occasion on which drugs, etc., are supplied. The Commissioners&apos; approval will extend to a flat rate not exceeding the average cost per prescription (to the nearest penny up) as disclosed by the statistical prescription data for the year 1916 ; and where such rate is adopted the doctors in rural areas should be notified accordingly. In this event it will be sufficient for the doctor to enter the letter &quot; M &quot; in the account when medicines are supplied in addition to the symbol representing the services rendered. Thus &quot; VM &quot; will signify that the doctor claims for medicines, dressings, etc., supplied by him on the occasion of a visit, as well as in respect of the visit itself. If the medicine is supplied in connection with the domiciliary treatment of a man recommended for sanatorium benefit, the letter &quot; D &quot; should be added to the symbol. - Where payment is not made at a flat rate it will be necessary for the doctor to submit detailed prescriptions to be priced and paid for in the same way as medicines supplied by chemists. Com-mittees will be credited in respect of medicines supplied to
invalided men under the special arrangements in the manner provided in Article 7 of the Regulations. &quot;yProcedure..36. In dealing with the procedure of Committees under the new arrangements, it is necessary to emphasise at the outset the importance of the requisite notification being sent, at the appro-priate stage in each case, by the Committee to the Commissioners. These notifications will form the basis of the Commissioners&apos; records for the purpose of the various financial adjustments involved ; and it is essential, therefore, in the interests of all parties, that great care should be taken to see that the proper notification is made. For the assistance of Committees, the various notifica-tions have been embodied in a single form (Form I.S. 4) a copy of which accompanies this memorandum. It is anticipated that the provision of a single Form will considerably facilitate the work of Committees under this head. The procedure to be followed by Committees in connection with invalided men (of which a summary in tabular form is given on page 28) is as follows : A. New Cases.I. Where the man applies for treatment by means of the specialform provided.37. As explained above, each man on being invalided will henceforth be supplied by the Ministry of Pensions with a special form for the purpose of selecting a doctor or institution. A copy of this form (Form I.S.1) accompanies this Memorandum, and it will be seen that it contains full instructions to the man as to the steps he is to take. On receipt of the Form the man, after com-pleting it in the manner required, * will be in a position to apply at once to a doctor for acceptance. The doctor will, in token of his acceptance, sign the Form in the space provided and send it to his Insurance Committee. On receipt of the Form the Committee will, subject in uninsured cases to the question as to the income of the man being answered in the negative : (i.) Issue to the man the special medical card (Form I.S. 3, a cojry of which is enclosed) provided for invalided men receiving treatment under the special arrange-ments, after inserting upon it particulars of the man&apos;s status as given on Form I.S. 1, the doctor&apos;s name, the serial number allotted to the card, followed by the Committee&apos;s cypher, and (by means of a rubber stamp) the Committee&apos;s name and address. The number of the medical card issued and the date of issue should at the same time be inserted on Form I.S. 1.*,The Form I.S. 1 provides for a statement by the man of the nature of his disablement. It should be borne in mind, however, that this statement is optional and must not be insisted upon.
1(ii.) Unless Form I.S. 1 shows that the doctor has not j afforded treatment on its production, notify thedoctor of the serial number of the card issued so that the doctor may enter it upon his account.(iii.) Notify the Commissioners of the admission of the man to the special arrangements by means of Form I.S. 4 completed in Sections I. and V.(iv.) If the Index Slip (in insured cases) is already in the possession of the Committee, endorse it by means of a rubber stamp, &quot;Invalided Man Attendance System &quot; and insert doctor&apos;s name. If the Index Slip is not with the Committee and the man is a member of an Approved Society, apply to the Society for it on Form I.S. 5 (a copy of which is enclosed), and prepare and insert in Index Register a Suspense Slip, endorsed as above, pending receipt of Index Slip. (In the case of insured men who are not members of a Society and in the case of the uninsured, the Index Slip will be issued by the Navy and Army Insurance Fund on receipt of Form I.S. 4. In these two categories, therefore, no special steps need be taken by the Committee -with regard to the Index Slip.)(v.) Insert Form I.S. 1 in a separate section of the Register reserved for the purpose. This section, which should be arranged alphabetically under the men&apos;s names, will form a convenient record of the special medical cards issued by the Committee.II. Where the man is ascertained to be an invalided, sailor or soldier on his application for treatment in some other way than by means of Form IS. 1. 38. These cases wall come to light mainly in one or the other of two ways, viz., the man in applying to the Committee may disclose the fact that he has been invalided, or the doctor in accepting the man by means of the ordinary medical card may discover the fact and notify the Committee.39. Where the man in applying to the Committee for medical benefit discloses the fact that he has been invalided, the Committee will, irrespective of the actual date of invaliding : (i.) Complete Form I.S. 1 so far as practicable, and issue it to the man with a slip telling him to furnish the missing information and take it to a doctor, who will afford treatment:(ii.) On the return of the Form through the doctor, follow the procedure set out in paragraph 37 above, com-pleting the Form I.S. 4, however, in Sections I. and VI.40. Where a man applying to a doctor for acceptance with an ordinary medical card is ascertained by the doctor to have been invalided from the Forces, the doctor will mark the medical card &quot; Invalided in ,&quot; giving month and j^ear of
invaliding, whicli he will obtain from the man on the presentation by the latter of the medical card. The Committee, on receipt of a card so endorsed, will deal with the case as if the man &quot;Bad submitted Form I.S. 1 to the doctor (see paragraph 37 above), except that the particulars of the man&apos;s status will be taken from the ordinary medical card, and : (i.) If the man applied to the doctor by means of Part A of the card The Form I.S. 4 sent to the Commissioners will be completed in Sections I. and IX., and a Form T.S. I, with the serial number of the special medical card, etc., will be prepared and filed in the special section of the register ;(ii.) 7/ the man applied to the doctor by means of Part B of the card The Form I.S. 4 sent to the Commissioners will be completed in Sections I. and X., and a Form I.S. 1, with the serial number of the special medical card, etc., will be prepared and filed in the special section of the register. If the removal was from another area, the Index Slip will be claimed from the old Committee in the ordinary manner.B. Transfer Cases, viz., cases tohere the man i-s on a doctors list and the doctor applies to be remunerated on the attendance basis.41. Form I.S. 2, a copy of which accompanies this Memoran-dum, has been prepared for the use of doctors in giving the requisite notice in these cases. On receipt of the Form duly completed, the Committee (unless they have reason to believe that the man is not an invalided soldier, in which event they will make enquiries of him) will: (i.) Issue to the man a special medical card prepared as in New Cases (see paragraph 37 above), but marked to show that the attendance basis of remuneration does not apply until the beginning of the following quarter.(ii.) Apply at the same time to the man for the return of his old medical card.(iii.) Notify the Commissioners by means of Form I.S. 4 (Sections I. and VII.) that the man has been admitted to the special arrangements.(iv.) Notify the doctor that the attendance basis of re-muneration will apply as from the beginning of the following quarter and that the man&apos;s name will be removed as from that date from the doctor&apos;s ordinary list.
1(v.) Stamp the Index Slip &quot; Invalided Soldier Allen-dance System &quot; and amend doctor&apos;s list. a (vi.) Insert Form I.S. 2, after entering on it the serial number of the special medical card, etc., in the special section of the register referred to at (v.) of paragraph 37 above.Removals of Invalided Men admitted to the SpecialArrangements.42. The special medical card, it will be seen, provides for treatment being obtained during temporary absence from the district of the doctor selected, and for a fresh choice of doctor where the removal is otherwise than temporary.43. Where treatment is obtained during temporary residence the man will sign the card in the space provided for the purpose, viz., Part C ; and the doctor will forward it to his Committee, who will: (i.) If the card is a &quot;foreign&quot; one, notify the &quot;home&quot; Committee, stamp and re-issue the card (unless informed by return of post that the man is no longer entitled) and enter the case in the record of temporary residents treated in the area, (ii.) If the card is their own, verify by reference to their Register that the man is still entitled ; and, if so, issue a fresh card bearing the same serial number, so that the man is armed afresh with the means of obtaining treatment, if necessary, on again being temporarily absent from home.It will be seen that no notification need be sent to the Com-missioners in the case of temporary removals.44. Where the removal is otherwise than temporary the man will sign the card in Part B; and the Committee, on receipt of the card from the doctor selected, will: (i.) If the removal is icithin the area of the Committee issue a new special medical card bearing the same serial number and amend the doctor&apos;s name on the Form I.S.1 (or 2) and the Index Slip. No notification need in this case be sent to the Com-missioners ;(ii.) If the removal is from another Committees area-apply to the old Committee by means of the first half of the special medical card for the Index Slip and corresponding Form I.S.1 (or 2). The old Committee will thereupon transmit these docu-. ments to the new Committee, making any necessary entries in their records, and inform the Commis-sioners by means of Form I.S. 4 (Sections I. and II.) of the transmission.   On receipt of the Slip, etc.,
the new Committee will issue a special medical card duly completed with serial number, doctor&apos;s nafc&amp;e, etc., and notify the Commissioners by means of 0 Form I.S. 4 (Sections I. and VIII.) that they havedone so. The Slip and Form I.S. 1 (or 2) will then be duly amended and inserted in their appropriate places in the new Committee&apos;s register. The serial number of the new card issued will, of course, be the next unused number of the new Committee&apos;s series and their cypher.Suspension of invalided men who have been admitted to the special arrangements.45. In all cases where an invalided man receiving treatment under the special arrangements ceases, for any reason, to be entitled to medical benefit, the Committee will remove the Form I.S.1 (or 2) from their special register and the Index Slip from the Index Register. They will at the same time inform the Commissioners by means of Form I.S.4 (Sections I. and III.).46. It will be appreciated that under the new Regulations an invalided man may cease to be insured, and nevertheless be eligible for medical benefit in an uninsured capacity, if his income does not exceed  160 per annum. Where, therefore, a notification is received that an insured invalided man is disentitled to benefit, it will be necessary to afford him an opportunity of claiming benefit as an uninsured man, unless it is apparent from the notification that the lapse from benefit is consequent upon his death or emigration. As the notifications of suspension to be dealt with under tins head will not in all cases disclose that an invalided man is involved, a printed notice affording the necessary opportunity of making a claim should be enclosed in all notifications issued by the Committee suspending an insured man from medical benefit except where the notification indicates death or emigration. A suitable form of notice (Form I.S.6) accompanies this Memor-andum.47. Where an invalided man desires to continue in benefit as an uninsured man with an income not exceeding  160 per annum, the Committee&apos;s action will depend upon whether the man was previously receiving treatment under(i.) the special arrangements, or (ii.) the ordinary arrangements.If (i), the Committee will amend Form I.S.1 (or 2) to show that the man is now entitled as an uninsured man and inform the Commissioners by means of Form I.S.4 (Sections I. and IV.). If (ii), the Committee will issue to the man a special medical card, bearing a serial number, etc., notify the doctor that he will hence-forth be remunerated in &quot;respect of the man on the attendance basis, and inform the Commissioners by means of Form I.S.4 (Sections I. and IV.).  A Form I.S.1 will at the same time be pre-
pared for insertion in the special register of invalided men receiving treatment under the special arrangements. In both (i) and (ii) the Index Slip will be removed from the Register, since the man now belongs to the uninsured category, and an amended Index Slip will be issued by the Navy and Army Insurance Fund on receipt of the Form I.S.4.Periodical enquiry into position of invalided men admitted to the special arrangements.48. It will be realised that unless special steps are taken there is a risk that invalided men will continue to be regarded as re-ceiving benefit under the special arrangements after they have died or emigrated or ceased for some other reason to be entitled to medical benefit. As the risk is one which, in the case of insured invalided men is likely to operate to the disadvantage of the General Medical Benefit Fund, it is proposed to conduct special enquiries at periodic intervals into the position of the men admitted to these arrangements where a doubt exists as to their right to continue in benefit. Further particulars under this head will be furnished to Committees in due course.Submission of Accounts.49. It will be seen that in conformity with the Regulations accounts are to be submitted quarterly. On receipt of the accounts (which should be arranged alphabetically by the doctor) they shoidd be evaluated on the prescribed scale of credit fees. The Committee will then check those accounts bearing other Committee&apos;s serial number against the Temporary Resident record (see paragraph 43 above), and the remainder against the Forms I.S.1 and 2. Where the Committee cannot identif3r a case in respect of which an account is submitted, it should be returned to the doctor for further information. In the process of checking the accounts, the Form I.S.1 (or 2) should be marked to show that an account for the quarter has been received and its amount. The account itself should at the same time be marked, in the space provided, to show whether it relates to a New or a Transfer Case. Form I.S.1 will under the above arrangements signify a New Case and Form I.S.2 a Transfer Case.50. The total of each doctor&apos;s accounts for the quarter should then be ascertained and noted in the Committee&apos;s records ; and the accounts themselves forwarded to the Commissioners. A summary form for transmission with the accounts will be issued in due course.Advances.51. Advances should be made quarterly in respect of the accounts. Having regard to the amount payable in the past on temporary resident settlements, the Commissioners consider that, for the present, advances may be made up to 90 per cent, of the face value of the accounts.
Delay in Recovering Index Slips Relating to Invalided Soldiers admitted to the Special Arrangements.52. It will be observed that with a view to obviating delay in recovering Reinstatement Slips from Approved Societies in respect of members admitted to the special arrangements, the procedure provides for application being made for the Slip on a special form. Societies are being instructed that these forms should receive early attention and that they can be accepted, for this purpose, as evidence of the member&apos;s discharge from the Forces. Where the Committee are unable to recover the Index Slip of a man admitted to the special arrangements after six months, the Com-missioners will be prepared to assist, so far as practicable, on receipt of the particulars of the man and of the steps already taken by the Committee.
art III. SANATORIUM BENEFIT.AMENDING 1917 ACT.53. As stated in paragraph 3, uninsured seamen, marines and soldiers invalided from service, who have hitherto been ineligible for sanatorium benefit, will now (with the sole exception of those whose total income from all sources exceeds  160 per annum) become eligible for that benefit upon their discharge at the cost of the Navy and Army Insurance Fund.REVISION OF SANATORIUM BENEFIT FINANCE OF NAVY AND ARMY INSURANCE FUND.54. Simultaneously- with the admission of this new class of ex-service men to sanatorium benefit at the cost of the Fund, it is proposed to establish new financial arrangements for defraying the cost of sanatorium benefit in all cases chargeable to the Fund, including both those who were previously eligible as members of the Fund as well as those now admitted. Hitherto the Fund has recouped Insurance Committees for the precise cost incurred by them in respect of the treatment of each individual man. But this system has not appeared to be wholly satisfactory ; and it is especially desirable, now that the amending Act has furnished an opportunity of simplifying all the arrangements relating to invalided sailors and soldiers, to get rid of the present differentia-tion in the financial arrangements applying to different classes of men by bringing the financial arrangements of the Fund into line with the financial arrangements relating to members of Approved Societies.55. It is thus proposed that in a Fund case recommended for sanatorium benefit within three months of his discharge a case value should be payable to the Committee thus recommending him. This case value would be paid, not, as in the case of an Approved Society member, out of the General Sanatorium Benefit Fund, but out of the Navy and Army Insurance Fund. In addition, the Fund will pay an annual capitation rate of Is. 3d. per annum. By the institution of this system the financial arrangements relating to all invalided sailors and soldiers will be rendered practically uniform, and differentiation avoided.56. This change of procedure will not, however, affect the case of Fund members already receiving treatment under the old financial arrangements, which will continue to apply to such cases until the termination of their treatment.57. The new class of invalided men now admitted to sanatorium benefit at the cost of the Fund will also come within the scope of the preferential arrangements announced in Circular 53 LC. ; and Military Hospitals wall accordingly notify such cases to the Commissioners under the A.F.O. 1835 procedure, instead of to
the Local Government Board. Exchequer Grants under Circular 53 I.C. will be available in Fund cases as well as in the case^f members of Approved Societies.58. Cases of uninsured men whose income exceeds  100 will be dealt with centrally by the Pensions Ministry, with the assist-ance of the Commissioners. It is understood that the Local Government Board will continue to deal with the case of unin-sured commissioned officers.Revision of Circular 53 I.C. Arrange-ments.59. At the same time the opportunity has been taken of revising the Circular 53 I.C. arrangements by the introduction of certain reforms which experience has demonstrated to be desir-able. In the first place arrangements have been made with the Admiralty and Army Council whereby the naval and military hospitals will transmit to the Insurance Commissioners the A.F.O., not only in the case of tuberculous sailors and soldiers who are deemed to require residential treatment and who are willing to accept such treatment, but in the case of all sailors and soldiers known to be tuberculous on discharge. The form will contain, however, as before, a statement whether the Medical Officer of the Hospital regards residential treatment as essential, and a state-ment whether the man accepts or declines such treatment. For the purpose of procedure the forms* thus received by the Com-missioners may be classed under the following three heads, A, B, and C.A.-Cases where the Hospital Authorities certify that Residential Treatment is essential, and the Patient accepts.60. The Commissioners will communicate with the Committee (enclosing a copy of the A.F.O.); and, provided that the man does not change his mind and refuse to enter the sanatorium accommodation provided for him, the Grant will be payable.61. The procedure in these circumstances will not differ mate-rially from that which has hitherto been followed in similar cases. Attention is, however, directed to the following points : Furlough.62. It is understood that the War Office and Pensions Ministry have, after consideration, arrived at the decision that the granting of short furlough upon discharge in suitable cases may, without involving disproportionate disadvantages, remove some of the grounds which have hitherto contributed to the re-fusal of soldiers to accept treatment. It is understood to be the experience of Insurance Committees that a short period of fur-* The A.F.O. 1835 is bring revised for use under the new arrangements, and will be renumbered A.F.O. 1835a.
1lough between the date of dismissal from the Military Hospital a*Jli the patient&apos;s entry to the sanatorium would be likely to enhance the willingness of soldiers to accept the treatment offered and to derive the fullest benefit therefrom ; and it is believed therefore that this change of procedure will be welcomed. Account will accordingly have to be taken in any individual case, in the arrangements between the Insurance Committee, the Com-missioners and the Military Hospital, of any furlough allowed ; and steps will be taken in such cases to secure that any necessary travelling warrant for the journey from the soldier&apos;s home to the sanatorium is provided by the Military Authorities.Subsequent Refusal to enter a Sanatorium.63. It is, of course, not uncommonly found that sailors and soldiers in this class (viz., who have accepted the offer of treatment made at the Military Hospital) either subsequently change their minds and refuse to enter the sanatorium, or after a few days&apos; treatment insist upon leaving. It should be borne in mind that under the Royal Pensions Warrant certain powers are reserved to the Pensions authorities bearing very materially upon this difficult problem in the case of pensioners. In the first place, the Warrant enables a special allowance to be made to the dependants of a pensioner during Ms treatment in an institution ; and, secondly, it is competent to the Pensions Ministry to make a substantial reduction in the pension of a man who refuses to avail himself of treatment offered or by his own acts prejudices the value of treatment which he is undergoing.64. It will be necessary, therefore, to provide for thenotifica-tion in cases under this head (as well as in the cases dealt with in subsequent heads) of any refusal of men to avail themselves, or to continue to avail themselves, of the treatment provided, and of admissions to and discharges from residential institutions. The specific machinery for this purpose, so.far as it concerns Insurance Committees, is dealt with in paragraphs 73 to 77 below.B. Cases where the Hospital Authorities certify that Residential Treatment is essential but the Patientrefuses.65. In these cases, notwithstand:ng the man&apos;s refusal, the A.F.O. will be transmitted to the Insurance Committee. Upon its receipt the Insurance Committee should at once endeavour to get into touch with the man, to have him examined by the Tuber-culosis Officer, and to induce him to avail himself of the necessary, treatment forthwith. The efforts of the Committee to induce the man to change his mind will, of course, be reinforced by those of the local War Pensions Committee.66. Where (a) the opinion of the Tuberculosis Officer (after such examination as he may think necessary) confirms the certi-ficate of the Medical Officer of the Military Hospital that residential
treatment is necessary, and (6) the man is induced to change his mind and to accept treatment within six months from the date oj-Jf&amp;s discharge, a grant will be payable to the Committee. The attention of Committees is directed to these two conditions, which have been imposed for the following reasons : (i.) While the acceptance of the certificate of the Military Hospital that residential treatment is essential is required of Insurance Committees as a condition of the grant in the case of men in Class A above, the circumstances calling for the adoption of such a course do not apply to men in Class B, who, having proceeded to their homes without having accepted treatment can be visited and examined by the Tuber-culosis Officer, since the circumstances in such cases will permit of the Committee dealing with the case on the expert advice of their Medical Adviser. In this class of case, therefore, the grant is payable only where residential treatment is given on the advice of the Committee&apos;s Medical Adviser in confirmation of the recommendation of the military authorities.(ii.) It is, moreover, a condition of a grant that the man should avail himself of the treatment offered within six months of the date of bis discharge. The object of this condition is to secure as far as possible that treatment is undergone by tuberculous ex-service men at the earliest possible stage when the prospect of the disease being cured or arrested is most favour-able. Many cases have come to the Commissioners&apos; notice in which men who could have reaped substan-tial benefit from early treatment have declined to avail themselves of any treatment until they are made to realise their condition by the decline of their earn-ing powers ; at this stage treatment is frequently of little use, and the Commissioners have accordingly deemed it desirable to focus every influence and ten-dency in the direction of securing that pressure is put upon tuberculous ex-service men to undergo treatment at the earliest possible date after discharge.67. Lf the man can be induced to avail himself of the treatment offered within three months after discharge, the Committee will receive, in addition to the Exchequer grant, the case-value payment under Article 24 of the Payments to Insurance Committees Regulations. Where, however, the man avails him-self of treatment after the expiration of three months, but within six months, after discharge, the Exchequer grant alone will be payable.68. In their efforts to secure the early acceptance of treatment Insurance Committees will, of course, have the co-operation of
the Pensions authorities, both central and local, through the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 63 above.C. Cases where the Hospital Authorities do not certify that Residential Treatment is essential.69. The A.F.O. received by the Commissioners in cases of this type will be transmitted forthwith to the Insurance Committee with a view to the Committee immediately (as in the case of Class B) getting into touch with the man and having him examined by the Medical Adviser or Tuberculosis Officer. Should the Medical Adviser confirm the view that some other form of treat-ment than residential treatment is suitable, the Committee will, of course, afford sanatorium benefit in that form ; and if the case is recommended, and the treatment accepted, within three months of discharge, a case value will be payable to them under Article 24 of the Payments to Insurance Committees Regulations. Should, however, the Medical Adviser dissent from the view of the military medical authorities, and advise that residential treatment is necessary, an Exchequer grant will also be made, provided that, as in Class B, the man is induced to avail himself of such treatment within six months of discharge, this limit being imposed for the same reasons as those explained in paragraph 66 above.70. The above three classes, A, B and C, are exhaustive as regards the procedure relative to men discharged after the estab-lishment of the new arrangements described in this memorandum. The Committee should report to the Commissioners any case in which they have reason to believe that no A.F.O. has been issued in respect of a man discharged hereafter suffering from, tuberculosis at the time of his discharge.D. Cases of men discharged with Tuberculosis prior to the issue of this Memorandum who for one reason or another failed to obtain the benefit of the special arrangements and to be made the subject of a grant.71. It will be within the knowledge of Insurance Committees that in numerous cases soldiers discharged with tuberculosis have refused to take advantage of the special arrangements hitherto in force, and have refrained from making application for sanatorium benefit until a considerable time after discharge. Provision is now made for overcoming reluctance of this character in the case of men hereafter discharged (see paragraph 63 above); but that provision has not been long available ; and there can be no doubt that the refusal of men to accept the benefit of the special arrangements in the past has been largely due to the absence of the advantages now afforded. In these circumstances the Commissioners have decided, aC the request of the Ministry of Pensions, to make the usual Exchequer grant in any case brought
to the Committee&apos;s notice after the date of issue of this Memo-randum of a sailor or soldier who (a) Was discharged suffering from tuberculosis prior to that date;(b) Was not previously made the subject of a grant, and who(c) Is hereafter afforded by the Committee on the advice of their Medical Adviser, and avails himself of, resi-dential treatment.72. It will be borne in mind that all the above procc-dure under the revised Circular 53 I.C. arrangements will apply to all invalided sailors or soldiers known to be tuberculous on dis-charge, irrespective of whether they are members of Approved Societies or not, excluding only uninsured men whose income exceeds  160 per annum. They will also apply, of course, to insured commissioned officers.NOTIFICATION OF REFUSALS TO ACCEPT TREAT-HE NT, AND OF ADMISSION TO AND DIS-CHARGE FRO31 RESIDENTIAL INSTITUTIONS.73. In order that the Pensions authorities may be in a position to exercise the powers referred to in paragraph 63 above, it is necessary to arrange for them to be notified of any refusal of a sailor or soldier to undergo the treatment or to avail himself properly of it.74. In cases in which the Commissioners are informed on the A.F.O. by the authorities of the Military Hospital that the man has refused the treatment offered him, the Commissioners will themselves notify the Pensions Ministry. In all cases in which the man has refused the offer made to him by the Insurance Committee locally (as distinct from the offer made to him at the Military Hospital) the Insurance Committee should themselves forthwith notify the local War Pensions Committee concerned of the refusal, notwithstanding that he may have previously refused treatment when the offer was put before him at the Military Hospital.75. Conversely, the Pensions Authorities will require to be informed of the admission to and discharge from residential institutions of tuberculous sailors and soldiers in order that the necessary arrangements may be made for the payment of allow-ances, where due, during the period they remain as inmates of the institution.76. The procedure of notification will depend upon the class of case affected. In cases under head A above it is understood that the arrangements for payment of allowances will be made by the Ministry of Pensions ; and it would appear the more con-venient course to all authorities concerned that in these cases the Insurance Committee should notify the Commissioners of admis-
sions to, and discharges or departures from, residential institutions, afiti that the Commissioners should themselves arrange to transmit the information to the Pensions Ministry. In cases under heads B, C and D, and in any other cases, the Insurance Committee should notify admissions, discharges and departures to the local War Pensions Committee concerned.77. Notifications of admission, whether to the Commissioners or to the local War Pensions Committee, must be made immediately after the admission. As regards discharges and departures of men from residential institutions, the Insurance Committee should arrange to notify the Commissioners or the local War Pensions Committee (as the case may be) of the discharge in advance of the event in all normal cases in which it takes place at the expiration of the full period of residential treatment afforded by the Committee. In all such cases in which the residential treatment runs its full course, the Committee will be aware of the date of the impending discharge and can notify it in advance. In cases of the man&apos;s own premature departure, or of his sudden dismissal under the rules of the institution, the Insurance Committee should make the notification immediately after they become aware of the man&apos;s removal from the institu-tion, giving particulars of the facts. It will be appreciated that prompt notifications will be essential in every case without fail, in order that payment of allowances may not be continued beyond the period for whicli they are due.GENERAL CONDITIONS OF THE REVISED SCHEME OF EXCHEQUER GRANTS.78. It will be borne in mind that it has been and will continue to be a general condition of grants under the Circular 53 I.C. arrangements that treatment shall be given to the ex-service men in question immediately it is required and to the Commissioners5 satisfaction (see paragraph 8 of Circular 53 I.C.). Hitherto the Commissioners have not found it necessary to lay down any definite standard or criterion of their satisfaction ; nor indeed have they had any occasion for dissatisfaction with the action taken by Insurance Committees, who have, since the inception of these arrangements, co-operated most loyally and thoroughly with the Commissioners in promoting the special welfare of all tuberculous discharged sailors and soldiers whose cases have been brought to the Committee&apos;s notice. It m&amp;y, however, be as well to set forth certain considerations which were not in exis-tence upon the estabhshment of the Circular 53 I.C. arrangements, and which should be present to the minds of Insurance Com-mittees in the course of their administering the revised arrange-ments.79. The arrangements were originally established at the instance of the Admiralty and Army Council. Since that date, however, authorities have been established (in consultation with
whom the revised arrangements have been framed) for the special care of disabled sailors and soldiers. In pursuance of this fun^on the Pensions Ministry have made certain provision in the Royal Warrant, and have, in Instructions recently issued, authorised local War Pensions Committees themselves to make provision of certain forms of special treatment.80. Section 4 of the amending Act, quoted in the opening paragraph of this memorandum, was framed at the wish of the Pensions Minister, by Avhom it was desired that all invalided sailors and soldiers should, by virtue of that capacity, be eligible for medical benefit. Similarly, with the inclusion in the Circular 53 I.C. arrangements of the small additional number of tuberculous sailors and soldiers not hitherto eligible for sana-torium benefit, these arrangements have assumed a slightly different character ; and arc. in fact, as the Commissioners under-stand, recognised by the Pensions Minister (like the provision of medical benefit for invalided ex-service men) as jwo ianlo discharging the responsibilities of the Pensions Ministry for the treatment of the men in question.81. The Instructions referred to make it clear, therefore, that tho obligations imposed upon local War Pensions Committees do not extend to the general practitioner treatment of such men, nor (without special sanction from the Ministry) to their special treat-ment for tuberculosis. The Commissioners have no doubt that, quite apart from the assistance afforded by the system of Ex-clicqucr grants under the Circular 53 I.C. arrangements, Insurance Committees do not and would not disdain full responsibility for the treatment of any tuberculous individual of so specially deserving a class. As regards the standard of treatment implied in the accept-ance by an Insurance Committee of such responsibility, the Com-missioners believe that Committees make a practice of affording to all such men whatever treatment their own expert Medical Adviser in his unfettered medical judgment recommends ; and they are of the opinion that the system of grants referred to, as extended in the manner indicated in this memorandum, enables Committees to afford such treatment with the necessary promptness. Accord-ingly, while the Commissioners have no reason to apprehend that Committees will fall short of this standard in administering the new Circular 53 I.C. arrangements, it may be convenient for them to state, in the first place, that the observance of this standard will comply with the general condition of the scheme of Exchequer grants requiring the Commissioners to be satisfied as to the treat-ment given. Further, the Commissioners understand that the observance of such a standard would also involve a sufficient satisfaction of the claims to consideration possessed by such men by virtue of their status as disabled sailors or soldiers ; and, if adhered to, would justify the Pensions Ministry in relying upon this special machinery as adequately discharging that Depart-menfs express functions in the matter, and would dispense with
the necessity for the establishment of any separate arrangements fojkthe purpose.82. It should be noted that the observance of this standard is. incumbent upon a Committee in the provision of treatment for any man in respect of whom a grant has been made, whether the grant accrued to that Committee or to some other Committee in whose area the man first became subject to the special arrange -ments.83. Care should be taken by Committees not to lose sight of the tuberculous men receiving sanatorium benefit under these arrangements ; and every effort should be made to keep in touch with them during periods of domiciliary and dispensary treatment for which they may be nominated, and to ensure, so far as possible, that such treatment is received.&quot;PENSIONS MINISTRY CASES.&quot;84. The foregoing paragraphs of this Part of this Memorandum relate to the arrangements and procedure under the revised Circular 53 LC. scheme, and to the administrative duties de-volving upon Insurance Committees thereunder and the condi-tions attaching to the payment of the special Exchequer Grants under the scheme.85. That scheme does not, however, contemplate the continued maintenance in residential institutions by Insurance Committees of tuberculous men who have been pronounced according to medical opinion to have reached the stage of the disease connoted by the formula set forth below; and, while the Commissioners are aware that Committees have not infrequently secured resi-dential accommodation for such cases at the cost of their own funds, the conditions of grants referred to in the preceding section of this memorandum do not extend to the continued maintenance of these men in residential institutions, and do not require Com-mittees to undertake such maintenance as part of the duties devolving upon them under the scheme.86. The Pensions Ministry has, however, decided to make residential provision in the case of all such men who are willing to avail themselves of it, and for whom suitable accommodation can be found. Steps have already been taken by the Ministry to establish or reserve special accommodation for the purpose in certain parts of the country ; and it is understood that the Ministry are prepared to admit to and maintain in this accom-modation (or, where necessanr and practicable, in other suitable accommodation), at the cost of Exchequer Funds, any tuberculous disabled man whose condition is, according to competent medical opinion, such that a certificate in the following terms can properly be given : -
&quot; While I do not think it reasonably probable thai residential treatment will restore the patient to any material degree of working capacity, his condition renders it desirable in his own interests that he should be an inmate of a residential institution.&quot;The Ministry will regard this condition of the disease in the man as a sufficient qualification for access to the special provision which that Department is making.87. In the interests of the patients themselves there should, of course, be no interruption between the termination of the course of treatment afforded by the Insurance Committee and their admission to the special accommodation ; and the following arrangements have accordingly been made between the Pensions Ministry and the Commissioners to facilitate the necessary co-ordination.88. As the first intimation that the man&apos;s condition is such as to call for his removal to special accommodation will presumably be forthcoming in nearly every instance in the course of the periodical review of his case under the Insurance Committee&apos;s arrangements by the Committee&apos;s Medical Adviser, the initiative will normally rest with the Insurance Committee. If and when the Medical Adviser reports to the Insurance Committee in the terms of the certificate referred to in paragraph&apos; 86, the Committee should report the case forthwith to the Commis-sioners, giving name, address, regimental and approved society, &amp;c, particulars, and enclosing a suitable medical report by the Medical Adviser embodying the above-mentioned certificate. The Commissioners will thereupon refer the case to the Pensions Ministry, which Department, after taking any independent medical advice which they may require, will inform the Com-missioners of their decision as to whether financial liability will be accepted by the Ministry for the man&apos;s maintenance.89. If the decision is that the Ministry do not accept liability, the Commissioners will notify the Committee, who will proceed without reference to any provision by the Ministry.90. If the decision is that the Ministry accept liability, the Ministry will, in communicating this decision, also inform the Commissioners whether a vacancy exists in any conveniently accessible accommodation specially reserved or established by the Ministry.(a) If a vacancy in any special accommodation exists, the Commissioners will notify the Committee of the institution in which the vacancy exists ; and the Committee will thereupon arrange for the patienfs removal to the bed thus designated.(6) If no such vacancy in any special accommodation exists, the Pensions Ministry, in notifying the fact, will authorise the Commissioners to sanction a suitable
a bed being secured,, or themselves to secure such a bed. at the expense of the Ministry on terms not exceeding a specified rate. The necessary steps would then be taken as regards the selection of accommodation; and arrangements would be made by the Committee for the removal of the patient to the bed thus procured.91. Accounts for the maintenance of patients in any accommo-dation specially reserved or established by the Ministry will be rendered direct to the Ministry. In other cases under (6) above, the Commissioners will deal with the procedure to be adopted in each case as it arises. The cost of the patienfs travelling expenses to the institution will, in either case, be refunded by the Ministry.92. The Committee should refrain from reporting to the Commissioners if they have any reason to anticipate that the man will decline to avail himself of the Pensions Ministry accom-modation when provided. Due precautions should be taken in connection with the arrangements for &quot; Pensions Ministry Cases,&quot; to ensure that no indication is given to the men that their condition is in any way exceptional.93. For convenience of reference the procedure of Committees under this Part of this Memorandum is summarized on page 32.Part IV. ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES OF COMMITTEES.94. Under the new arrangements Committees have the duty of administering the medical and sanatorium benefits of unin-sured men and of administering on a new footing the sanatorium benefit of insured members of the Navy and Army Fund. In respect of each uninsured invalided soldier there will be paid out of the Navy and Army Fund to the credit of the Administration Accounts of Committees the same sum as is payable in respect of the administration of the medical benefit of members of Ap-proved Societies, i.e., 3d. per person per annum. As regards the administration of sanatorium benefit of invalided soldiers, its cost will, of course be taken into account in determining the amount to be transferred from the Sanatorium Benefit Fund to the Administration Fund under Articles 48 (1) iv. and 50 (2) (b) of the Insurance Committees Consolidated Regulations, 1916.National Health Insurance Commission (England), August., 1917.
