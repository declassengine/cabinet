oftSS STATES-     The effect of the new United States prohibitionList published oa lug. 27th, is that no goods may be exported to European neutrals without licence,   The precise form of the machinery to be employed in cooperation with H.M. Govern-ment is still under discussion.Our Ambassador in Washington reports that Mr - McCorraick is gradually taking the position of informal iimerican Blockade Minister with direct access to the president.   Mr.MoConniek has already opened discussions with the Heutral Representa-tives at tfashingtoii.   He has discussed with the Swedish yepre-sentative the following proposals:  (1) The United States to absorb the total Swedish out put of iron ore;   and all exports of ore to Germany to cease.(2) Ho fodder to be imported into Sweden in excels of domestic requirements.(3) The United states to be satisfied as to the dostina-tion of all Swedish goods manufactured with the aid of American materials,(4) A suitable agreement to be reached regarding Russian transit.These suggestions are merely preliminary and have not yet been approved by the President.$e are anxious that the United states Govomment in dealing with Scandinavia should not prejudice their control of cereals and mineral oil.   We are drawing particular attention to the very serious shortage of oil in Sweden.   The question of cereals for Norway and Sweden is also urgent.   Mr. !Ioover&apos;s plan for dealing with Belgian Kelief cargoes will[y release considerable quantities of grain Tor Iforway and Swedenand must seriously weaken our position in pressing for aAttg. 24 - 30. 1917
settlement of outstanding questions with these countries. Our Minister in Christiania has reason to believe that Norway will resist Allied pressure ostensibly to the verge of starvation in order to demonstrate her neutrality to the satisfaction of our enemies.   He Sees no near prospect of checking Norwegian exports to tfermany unless   the import of cereals into lorway is immediately checked.Wo are asking whether Mr. Hoover will assist the proposed new Allied Purchasing Executive for meats and fats by refusing licences for   the export of these commodities until allied requirements have been met.SOUTH AHBKI0A.   The French Government have drafted a scheme for purchasing the surplus of the Argentine crops.   MT-Hoover approves of the scheme and is recommending tho United States Government to refuse licences -for the export of coal, agri-cultural machinery and other ^morican products to the Ar&amp;en-tine unless the Argentine Government 7/ill reserve for the Allies the whole of the surplus in question.   The United States censors are already stopping all cables from the United states to the argentine which refer to future dealings in foodstuffs.   Mr.Hoover calculates that with the strict-est economy the net Allied deficit in cereals cannot be less than 100*000.000 bushels, vhioh is about equivalent to the amount whidi will become available for export from the Argon-tine.   The French propone that the iilliod purchases should be financed under a joint arrangement by tho United States, France and Great Britain,   our Treasury has not yet approved the financial arrangements.The 1918 Argentine Budget Bill, which levies fresh taxes upon vessels leaving Argentine ports and generally increases the export duties on Argentine produce, empowers
the Executive to prohibit altogether the export of national commodities if it should be considered desirable., sWgDjgf. The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that i        it will be necessary for Sweden to export to Germany someportion of her surplus meat in return for Gorman coal.   The necessity is not obvious, since recent disclosures render it doubtful whether Sweden is receiving any, or at least any adequate compensation for her iron oro which is a far moreimportant export.It is reported that 1he Swedish Government intend to make it illegal for Swedish Banks to issue any new loans to foreigners or foreign countries, or to renew existing loans.Sphere is abundant evidence that Swedish supplies of Mineral Oil are virtually exhausted,   all stocks have been commandeered and are only released for essential Industries. The fishing fleets are being drastically reduced and the Swedish Port Authorities have even had to withdraw lights of minor importance.-* HOftWAY.   The Norwegian Government have practically inhibited the export of Wool, Cotton, Flax and all products and by-products and waste of these commodities.   This prohibition is the result of our refusal to allow Norway to import wool.5&quot; BBHHARK. Negotiations are taking place between the appropriate Danish and Norwegian authorities for disposal of some part of the Danish meat surplus in Norway.   The Danish Government are also reported to be offering to increase the Danish exports of pork to Sweden.The Anglo-Danish Hide Agreement expired on March 31st. Meantime stocks of native hides are accumulating in Denmark
4&quot;&apos; ?4and the Banish restrictions upon the export of hides and leather to Germany may at any moment be wl thdrawn.   We are accordingly asking tho United States government to consider a draft scheme for a nev? agreement.   The scheme provides r for the import into Denmark of a fixed ration of heavy hidesand tan n inornate rials upon condition that no hides or leather or leather manufactures or waste are exported to other than approved destinations and that certain quantities of native hides are exported to unobjectionable consignees.HJuSHBRLAIDS.      The Dutch have agreed to our proposals for a settlement of the Potato question.   Letters   of assurance for Dutch cargoes will be resumed as soon as the Dutch Government have definitely notified their adherence.   We require a formal assurance from the Dutch Government that no ftirther exports of potatoes to Germany will be authorised even on existinglicences.The Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs has renewed his assurances that metals will not be allowed to pane through Dutch territory for German account.   Metal cargoes for the Dutch Government will accordingly be allowed to proceed.Further difficulties have to be cleared up in regard to the agricultural agreement.   The Dutch Government haw temporarily prohibited the export of cheese.   lieantime we find that Germany has received quantities of cheese consider-ably in excess of what is due to her under the Agreement,   We shall insist that no fur thor exports to Germany take place until the deficiency in the exports to the Unitc?d Kingdom  has been made up*   our other difficulty is the urgent need of coming to some agreement as to the Dutch meat surplus.   If discussions are protracted until the slaughter and export of the Dutch surplus stock has become Imperative ihe Dutch may
he forced either to -enounce the Agricultural Agreement or to break the Agreement by exporting to Germany the meat for which we have failed to provide an outlet *   Our Repre-sentative recommends that these discussions should take place at The Hague.   He is informed that in future the Dutch Government intends to deal with all negotiations relating to exports through a Commission for whose decisions they will be responsible,We consider the Dutch estimates of their tonnage re-quireaents, submitted during tho recent negotiations for a shipping agreement, to be greatly exaggerated,   we acoording-ly propose to cancel all previous negotiations and to embody the two questions of coal and tonnage in a single new scheme. Briefly we propose that in return for supplies of British coal tho Dutch should allot Dutch tonnage to the Belgian Relief Commission on the basis of one ton of shipping for one ton of coal per month.   The Relief Commission require some 180,0-0 tons of new shipping and the Dutch require between 150.000 and 200,000 tons of British coal.   &apos;ifte scheme also provides that in return for bunkering and other facilities Dutch vessels should perform certain specified services which will not greatly interfere with their own trade;   that no Dutch vessels shall be laid up except by mutual agreement; and that no vessels at present in allied services or in trade between tho Dutch Colonies and Allied countries shall be withdrawn.   The scheme has been forwarded to WashingiDn for consideration by the United states Government.   We are pointing out that in surrendering our coal to the Dutch upon terms, we are using our most effective weapon in dealing with Dutch blockade questions.   Consequently, if the scheme should be accepted, we   must thereafter rely on the United States to deal with the oilier principal blockade questions on which we are at issue with Holland.
s7*&apos; miTZMLM^-      The Swiss -%nks are refusing to execute the financial provisions of the German-Swiss Agreement unless they are guarant teed that no reprisals will be taken against them by the( Allies,   tfhe Swiss foreign Minister has asked us for assuranaesthat no such reprisals are contemplated.   He h&amp;n intimated that the Swiss Government are prepared to allow the Allies - financial accommodation similar to that accorded to Germanytin the proposed German-swiss Agreement.-a. ITALY..    There appears to be little prospect of completing theinter-Allied arrangements for dealing with Italian oranges and lemons, and we cannot extend to the 1917-1918 crop of oranges our financial liability undor the 1916-17 scheme.   We are accordingly suggesting at Kome that Allied operations should be confined to the lemon crop.\h GBBBQBh-   In the forthcoming season Greek currants will be imported into the United Kingdom for Government account only.   The Greek Government have raised no objection to this proposal.:l0.g?AIff.     In view  of continued German attacks on merchantmen inSpanish territorial waters, Sir A.Hardinge has been instructed to urge the Spanish Government to improve their coastal patrols. We are inviting the support of the United States Government in these representations.We have announced to 1he Spanish Government that in anticipation of a general and satisfactory settlement of A$glo-Spanish difficulties we ere prepared to authorise at once the import into 1&amp;e United kingdom of 60$ of the Spanish grapes imported in 1916, also to grant licences for the exportto Spain of 30.tons of terro-m&amp;nganese.
(: 117.ill, REQUISITIONED ENEMY SHIPPING.      Allied negotiations for the purchase of requisitioned enemy shipping are not progressing favourably, The Siamese Government favour the retention of enemy ships in Siamese ports to form the nucleus of a Siamese Mercantile Marine after the war. &apos;    They are, however, willing to charter these ships to the Allies upon terms to be fixed by H.M. Government.     The French Government, who have been negotiating for the requisition of enemy tonnage in Brazilian ports, have been informed that&apos; the Brazilian Government regard themselves as holding these vessels in trust for the Central Powers and that they can do no more than put them into trade between Brazil and European countries.       The Chinese Government have, definitely decided to charter the enemy vessels in China to Chinese merchants, who will only be permitted to sublet them to the Allies.- IJAPAN. Sir C. Greene thinks Japan, owing to her need of American:   Isteel, may be induced to release a certain amount of Japanese tonnage for Allied services.      Japanese business men are urg-ing the Japanese Government to make any concessions which may be necessary in order to obtain export licences for United States material.     Sir 0. Spring Rice is.informed that the Japanese Mission to the United States will specifically offer Japanese tonnage in return for steel plate.&apos; BRITISH &amp; FRENCH IMPORT RESTRICTIONS.      Partly in order to restore the French exchange we have agreed drastically to restrict British staple exports to France and at the same time to admit into the United kingdom from France all goods on the British Prohibited List with a few specified exceptions.       We are explaining to the Japanese, Italian and Portuguese that these concessions cannot be generally extended;   but we have offered
to ad&amp;lt without restriction silk from Japan and Italy and wine from Portugal.germaii mnmixm campaign.The following is a summary of the losses of merchant shipping, due to enemy activities, which were officially reported in the period Aug. 24 - 301 1317, inclusive.
