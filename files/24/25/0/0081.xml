.*.-*-:   SUPPLIED   FOR   RUSSIA.   : -:%V ^-(Report by Lord Kilner - see War Cabinet 229, Minute 2)In accordance with the decision arrived at by the Warabinet on Friday last, September 7th, I had a meeting the samefternoon, with General Knox, Mr.Young and two representatives ofhe Shipping Controller^ Office - Mr.Graeme Thomson and Mr.Kemballooke, on the subject of the shipments from this country to Russia.ooording to the arrangement arrived at some weeks ago, after pro-racted discussions, between the Russian Government Committee inondon and the &quot;Milner&quot; Committee, it was finally decided that theount of tonnage to be allotted to Archangel for the remainder ofthe season should be reduced to 208,000 tons - apart from coal, whichhas always been separately dealt with.The 208,000 tons allotted to munitions and general mer-ohandise hare been distributed, with minute care, to meet as far aspoeeible the wishes of the Russian Government, only such articlesbeing included as were declared and admitted by us to be of primaryaecftsaity. (General Pools, when he was over here, gave us valuableadvioe on this point and all the goods destined to be sent wereftooording to him urgently needed).The latest date for shipping to Archangel is September30th, if not earlier.   , It was therefore contemplated that thewhole of their 208,000 tons should be despatched by that date.This agreement was subsequently varied by mutual consent, in orderto allow of 15,000 tons being sent to the Roumanians.    $he goods&amp;oat required by the Roumanians have to come from France, and someBritish ships, originally destined for the England-Archangel service, fc accordingly^re/diverted to French ports.-i:The tonnage available for Russia in this country was thus Educed to 193,000 tons.    Of these 104,000 tons are already at sea, ^OOQ tons are ready to go.   Of these 89,000 about 10,000 are actually
loaded to date,and at least another &quot;30,000 are on quay or on rail.the: ;H9,000 tons are to go in ten:ships, i .e. *:.? arnat Liverpool &apos;1&apos;; ;  at Manchesterv;.v&quot; -     ,2 at the port - of London-&quot;Q;The.representatives of the Shipping Controller stated that consider-ahie inconvenience and confusion would he caused hy attempting, at this late hour, to change arrangements which are so far advanced, and to Unload or unpack these goods.   It would/ of course, be possible to prevent their going to Russia, but it is .more thandoubtful whether we should have time to substitute other goods for- ourthem, even in the improbable contingency of/being able to agreewith the Russians, what the substituted goods should be.   Only aday or two ago a proposal had been made to the Russians to senda shipload of herrings instead of some other goods on the agreedprogramme, and had been emphatically rejected.After considering in detail the nature of the goodB stillto be sent and the possible alternatives, all those present at themeeting were unanimously of opinion that it was undesirable toattempt to alter the allocation of the   89,000 tons still remaining.thatThe goods which.it has been suggested/we should send to Russia in lieu of those which the Russians have themselves asked for, are herrings, flour, sugar, rice, tea and boots.With regard to herrings, it r/as stated by the yepresenta-tives of the Shipping Controller, that arrangements were being madeto bring a considerable quantity of these from Norway in Norwegian,V.&quot; &apos;&quot; -fr,om.. .coasting vessels which would be oonvoyc^ardoe to Archangel.   It hadalso been decided to try and carry 5000 tons of herrings from Vardoeto Archangel in :ships which it Was proposed to send from thisCountry to Norway with cool.It is doubtful whether the Food Controller would a&amp;ree to part with any of the stocks of flour, sugar and rice in this Country.As regards tea, General Knox stated that he did not believe that there was, judging by the price,,- any serious shortage in Russia.
9 c- 2a   -It was agreed, that &quot;boots were greatly needed,hut apart from the fact that a considerable quantity ofhoots and leather had been recently despatched from thiscountry to Russia and that several thousand tons morewere included in the 89,000 tons still to be sent, therewas a large stock of boots waiting to be shipped fromAmerica, which it was hoped might reaoh Archangelbefore the close of the season,
o rf&amp;   only i&quot;^ ln the list of goods still to be sent, with regard to which those present at the Meeting; felt any doubt and on which they did not desire to express an opinion-ars the 2 batteries of 6n howitzers (3 guns) which the Cabinet have decided to despatch to Russia   (W.C.Ho.,215 dated Aug. 15th 1917).     The amount of tonnage involved is guite inconsiderable.   My own. personal opinion is4 that having regard to our promises to the Russians and to the. atrong terms of our recent message (Mr.Balfour&apos;s telegram to 8ir George Buchanan So. 1709^;) it would be deplorable if we.now failed to send these gnna..    However doubtful we may be as to their prao-tical utility., it is impossible to pretend that there is any real difficulty about sending these few howitzers.The despatch of the big 14&quot; IT aval guns is in my opinion another matter, and the representatives of the Shipping Controller pointed out at the meeting that there were great practical diffi-oulties in loading and unloading these very large guns, while their transit on deck in foul weather is also a serious consideration.It remains to consider the question of the tonnage allocated to the conveyance of deal to Rusaia.    The amount of Coal to be sent from this country to Russia has already been reduced by 400,000 tons. On the reduced programme 211,000 tons reiaain to be shipped, of whichforeign Office telegram ITo. 1709.    Mr.Balfour instructed Sir 0. Buchanan - &quot;to express most strongly that His Majesty^ Government sarnestly desired tp assist Russia to the utaost of its power, and &apos;&amp;&amp; not trying to escape from its obligations in the matter of heavy Pins.    Irery heavy gun on which hands could be laid was needed for we western offensive, which was the heaviest the British army had *tt far undertaken, and which was now attaining its maximum Intensity; la order that the strain on Russia might be relieved, the Russian Government had repeatedly asked us to make this offensive as rigorous JJ possible, and Ronmania had made a similar appeal.    In spite of Jne fast that guns shipped to Russia now oould not be male use of rpr months to corns, orders had been given to resume the despatch J* heavy guns in order to remove the impression that we were weakening *a our intention to assist Russia&quot;
100,000 are already onboard, while the remainder will, unlesscountermanded, all he on board by the 15th September.   4-5colliers are destined for this service,     Of the 111,000Still to be loaded, 85,000 will be loaded on Russian ships.In daeiding, whether any or all of the coal,stilldue to Russia should be withheld, the following considerationsshould be borne in mind.1.     There is no doubt whatever that Russia is in , great need of all the coal she can get.    Constant protests have been made by the Russians against the.heavy reduction already, made in the supply of ccar originally, pj-xaised to them, and1 there .is no item-in. the supplieswhich they, still . expect from this, couiiojy1;^which they- attach -greater importance than their 211,000 tons of coal.2.     As already stated, 85,000 tons of the aboveamount are waiting oo be loaded-on Russian Shiptu     It Vv-ould be aii- extremely arbitrary proueeding to prevent the Russians using their own ch:&apos;.pid for-the conveyance of an article, of which they are 60greatly *n n9$d.3* colliers destined to take coal to Archangelare all wanted for return cargoes of pit-pi bps and timber.     Even if they are all sent, they will not be sufficient to ship the whole of the timber there, which we have already bought.In view of theae considerations those present atthe Meeting were all of opinion that it was undesirable tomake any alteration,in the arrangements for the despatch ofooal to Russia.
