In the end of July and the beginning of August the cold wet weather which we experienced in this country was felt over the greater part of Germany and must have seriously injured the quality of the crops which would then be   out and standing in the field.   After the 4th the weather improved, and although it was somewhat unsettled it probably did not interfere with the harvesting of the crops.   In      &quot;Horth VTest Germany there were gales from- the 27th to the Sist August. ;good Requirements cf Germany.   Very careful estimates of the crops are made by the German Government in the end of July and in August.   These are revised in September, and as soon as possible an apportionment of the crops is prepared.The estimates, although compiled with great care, and after full enquiry, proved to be unreliable last year.   In the case of barley, for example, it was asserted in a discussion in the Reichstag in March last that instead of 3,600,000 metric tons the actual crop was 2,500,000 metric tons.   The favourable estimates lod to an undue depletion of the bread stocks in the early part of the winter, with results Which are well known and it is highly unlikely that any substantial reserve of grain will be carried forward to 1918.-   Since the last estimate was made a year ago, the food regulations have been very much tightened up,, and there is now less opportunity for the farmer to feed himself and his live stock at the expense of the general consumer. .The Outlook for 1917-18.   In view of the scanty information and the great difficulty in estimating production under the abnormal conditions under which German agriculture is now being carried on, it would be absurd to attempt any quantitative estimate of the German harvest of 1917.   At the same time everything points to the crops (except late potatoes) being worse than those of last year.Spring sowing was late, a serious drought checked summer giowth, and the early autumn has not been specially favourable *   There is no evidence that nitrogenous manures were more abundant than in 1916, and phosphttic manures were almost%certainly scarcer.   The labour position was worse than in 1916&apos;and from underfeeaing, the work of both men and animals must have been very inefficient.    Had the wheat and rye crops been as good as 1916, we should certainly have seen optimisitic notes.in the newspapers; their absence is very reassuring; we may conclude that the winter crops of bread-corn, wheat and rye, are almost certainly worse than in 1916.   The spiiug sown      crops, oats and barley are certainly worse than in x^lo and the outlook for fodder is very bad indeed.It seems probable that so far as grain crops are concerned^ the harvest of 1917 will be no better than the bad harvest of 1915.   In that year Germany had a very large potato crop and also Imported much food.   Tbe potato crop of 19^7 Will certainly rail far short of the 1915 crop,: and unless Germany can secure large stocks of grain from&apos; Rumania and other occupied territory the harvest year 1917-18 is almost certain to bring greater hardships to the&quot; oeople than, the year through which they have just passed.
2Q r (j 3Junefroa a- report &quot;by Mr. MaxMulier as to other enemy harvests....... The prospects of the harvest continue to be the subjectof anxious discussion in the press and generally speaking, the accounts have not been of a nature to afford much comfort to the consumer.   The President of the Austrian National Pood Office announced at the end of June that the harvest in Hungary was only medium, and that in Austria the drought had inflicted such damage that the Condition of the wheat and rye crops could only be described as &quot;half favourable&quot; and barley, oats, and straw were even less promising.Reports from Bohemia, Moravia, and Galicia agree in speaking of an almost total failtfre/iti  hWl^provinces.   One of the Polish Deputies to the Eeichsrat said that in Western Galicia the hay harvest had not been one-third of the normal; rye in Borne parts was so poor that it had been cut for fodder; wheat waB still worse, and barley and oats would be very scanty, v/hile even if rain came during July it could produce little, if any, improvement, and Galicia, instead of exporting grain, would not be selfi-supporting during the coming year. ....... Last year&apos;s potatoes are exhausted, and the earlypotato crop, both in Austria and Hungary, has been a failure. ....... It 1b stated that the Austrian Government have beencontemplating a weekly ration of lb kilog of potatoes per head but the &quot;Neue Freie Prease&quot; writes that, in view of the very moderate prospects of the harvest, it does not see how it will be possible to exceed 1 kilog. per head per week........ Even from Hungary the reports are not very Sanguinethough Hungary will be considerably better off for grain than Austria.   Reliable information from Berne says that the harvest is fair in Southern Hungary, but bad in the North.   The latest Hungarian reports, it is true, give a rather more cheerful account.   The wheat orops are said to be the most promising,the yield in certain parts of the country being between 10 and 20 per cent/higher than last year, and the quality of the grain is described as very good,    ye is said to promise a medium crop but barley and oats show very poor results, which must still further complicate the fodder and brewing problems.   The &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; at the end of July wrote that, taking the harvest in the Dual Monarchy as a whole, it might safely be asserted that the supply of flour, bread; and potatoes in thf fourth year of the war was assured.^ That the Austrian authorities, however, are none too sanguine may be gathered -from the fact that they have informed the various local tupply organisations that it will be impossible to increase the bread ration owing to the harvest not having comt up to expectations. ....... The &quot;Pester ZJoyd&quot; expreseee the opinion that thoughhigher prices may possibly be justified in the oaoe of barley and oats on the ground that both these grains promise &quot;very satisfactory crops&quot;, this argument cannot be put forward as re-garde wheat and rye. J .....f   The accounts of the Roumanian harvest are still con-tradictory.   On the one hand, we hear on good authority from Berne that the crops in Roumania  at the end of June promised so well that the Central Empires might be said to be relieved of all anxiety as to their ability to hold out, so far as oorn was concerned, through the coming harvest year.   On the other hand, news received from Jasay dated the 28th
June, tells us that, according to information from German sources, the cultivated area in the occupied districts of Roumania is 2,660,000 hectares, of which 1,100,000 hectares are under wheat and maize and 230v000 under barley and oats.   If these figures are correct, they would show that not more than one-half the arable area of Wallachia and the Dobrudja, which in 1916 amounted to 4,407,716 hectares, has been cultivated this year.   The area under wheat and maize as here given is about one-third of that of last year; the proportion of barley and oats sown ia even smaller. Our Jassy informant added that the crop prospects in Moldavia were favourable and that this probably held good in regard to Wallachia, which had practically the aame climate as Moldavia.   On this basis he arrived at the conclusion that the harvest in the occupied parts of Boumania would ydeld about 1,100,000 tons of wheat and maize and about^250,000 tons of barley and oats, whereas in November 1916 when the Germans invaded the country they found, according to the estimate of the Roumanian General Staff, about 1,100,000 tons of wheat and 1,240*000 tons of maize.   Moreover, judging from the analogy of Moldavia, where the late winter.had interfered seriously with the sowing of spring wheat, our informant concluded that the area under wheat must be considerably smaller than the area under  maize....... It has been officially stated that the quantityof corn in the occupied territories available for export, after covering the requirements of the civil inhabitants and the army of occupation, amounted to about 1,000,000 tons, which all went to feed the Central Powers.SBRVIA:.......The harvest prospects in Servia were summarisedas follows in the &quot;Pester Lloyd of the 28th June;-wneat, of which about 15 to 20 per cent, more had been sown than last year, had dene exceptionally well and the average yield was likely to be a rich one.   Barley had been little sown, but the yield both in quantity and quality was expected to be good.   Oats on the con-trary, would be poor both in quantity and quality. Maize though backward had stood the drought well and had so far recovered under the recent rains that a good medium harvest was assured.   Generally speaking, the &quot;pester Lloyd&quot; estimated that the occupied Servian territories would yield a good harvest, con-siderably in excess of last year&apos;a.Mr, liax Huller adds as a note of warning that all statements from enemy sources even when of a semi-official nature are apt to prove misleading and in past years the enemy governments themselves have made big miscalculations as to the yields whether intentionally or not he cannot say.
