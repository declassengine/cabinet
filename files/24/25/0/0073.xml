Cutting is general throughout the country and leading has commenced in a f ow of the earlier districts.   The spell of wet weather whioh ended a week ago had the effect of keeping back the earlier harvests with the result that tho present stage of operations on both early and late farms is practically the same.1. District Agricultural Committoes.During the week a representative of the Board mot with the Executive Committee of Kinoardineahire with special reference to the ploughing up of large areas of grass land in the hands of certain proprietors.    He now reports that the negotiations between the parties concerned have been successful.2. Labour Soldiers.The Board have received oomplaints from many quarters regarding the inadequacy, both in numbers and in quality, of the soldier labour now being supplied for harvest.     The Board feel that unless steps are taken to assist farmers at the present stage, the ouocess of their 1918 programme will be seriously jeopardised since farmers will be disinclined to undertake additional cultiva-tion without a guarantee of an adequate supply of labour.3. Compulsory orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 8M*The Board have issued an Order under 21!. intimating their intention to enter into part of the lands of Anoh extending to 645 acres or thereby comprising the Deor Forest of Blackmount belonging to Lord Breadalbane, and tenanted by Lord Durham and thereafter to let the grazings on the said part of the Deer Forest for the purpose of increased food production.4. Supply of Tractors.The Board have arranged to be supplied by the Food Pro-ducticn Department of the Board of Agrioulture and Fisheries with 60 &quot;Titan&quot; Tractors.     These are at present at Liverpool, and it is expected that delivery will take place during the present month. From the firm of Sanderson &amp; Mills, Bedford, 2 Tractors have been, obtained and also 2 of the Caterpillar type from the Burford-Cleveland Company, London.    ten &quot;Overtime&quot; Tractors have been purchased from the &quot;Overtime&quot; QiXi&amp;m&amp;i q representatives in Edinburgh and an Order has been placed with Messrs John Wallace &amp; Sons, Glasgow /      V
Glasgow, for 10 Molino Tractors provided that these can be fitted with paraffin carburetters, while a Martin Tractor has been procured for the Midlothian Committee.    Up to date the supply of 85 Tractors has beon provided for.5. Supply of Ploughs.       ;0The whole output of the works of Messrs George Sellars &amp; Sons, Kuntly,&apos; as far. as 3 furrow tractor ploughs are conoerned has been arranged to bo purchased by the Board.    In all the number of 3 furrow ploughs will not exceed 60 but a certain pro-portion of these may have to be released to private owners of Tractors.    This will be done by a Permit from the Board.6* supply of Horses.The number of horses purchased for the use of Committees up to this date is 16.    Tho requirements of all the Committees in this connection have not yet been furnished.7*&quot;Training OoTiooyrorlTcrtor Tractor Drivers.Arrangements have now been completed for the setting up of a Training School for drivers, within a reasonable distance of Edinburgh.    It is proposed to have 5 Traotors and Ploughs at work and that 50 pupils overy fortnight should be instructed under the charge of 5 instructors.      A considerable number of applications have been received from civilians and it is hoped that the School will be opened within 10 days.    The training school will continue for a period of probably 2 months.8. Supply of Basio Slag for 1917-18.The ^oard havo issued tho attached circular as a guide to farmers detailing the names of suppliers and prices of Basic Slag operative during tho coming season.9. Supply of Superphosphates for 1917-18.The Board have distributed the attaohed circular enclosing a copy of an Order issued by the Ministry of Munitions prescribing the maximum prices and other conditions of sale of Superphosphates during 1917-18.1*   Collection of Statistics and Returns relating to Agriculture.* *   Annual AgriculturalJteturns.The Preliminary Statement of the Agricultural Returns was issued on 31st ultimo.     A copy Is appended.2. Estimated of Produce of Crops.On /
On the appearance of the crops at 1st instant, it is estimated that the yield of wheat per acre will be 3 per cent under the average, barley and oats 3 per cent over the average, and potatoes 8 per cent over the average.Tho estimated total yields of theso crops are ae followe:-Wheat   .....   300,000 quartersBarley .....   745,000      &quot;Oats   ..... 5,080,000      &quot; Potatoeo .. 1,035,000 tone.3. Monthly Returns of Live 3took.The returns for 4th instant are now being received and tabulated.
BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLANDPRICES OF BASIC SLAG FOR THE SEASON 1917-18.The Ministry of Munitions, in conjunction with the makers of Basic Slag, have, made arrangements in regard to the maximum prices to -be charged by the latter during the present season. The usual commission charged by dealers has also been ascertained, and the prices stated below indicate the rate at which farmers should be able to purchase Basic Slag, excluding the cost of delivery from the works to the farmers nearest railway station. As dealers usually quote Basic Slag at a delivered price, the farmer is recommended, when purchasing, to ascertain the cost of delivery (i.e,, haulage, sheeting, and any other charges) from the works to his nearest station, and after adding it to the price stated below, to compare the resulting figure with the price asked by the dealer.This notice is intended only as a guide to farmers in making future purchases. It is not contemplated that contracts already made should be cancelled.The difference shown in certain cases between the prices of nominally similar grades are understood to be due either to slight variations in the qualities of slag produced by different works or occasionally to the situation of the works.BASIC SLAG.Prices per Ton including Dealers Commission for lots of not less than 4 tons, free on rail at Works, in maker&apos;s single 2 cwt. bags, net cash.ENGLAND AND WALES.Anglo-Continental Guano Works (London): Citric Soluble 18 per cent., 55s. ; 20 per cent., 60s.British Basic Slag [Alberts Successors), Limited.
