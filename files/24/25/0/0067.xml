No. 1231.

Korniloff said this evening that to disguise extreme seriousness of the situation would be a crime. He said he was not even sure of saving Petrograd. He has been, however, given command Petrograd. Kerenski did not come to-day but Savenk, the virtual Minister of War who, a week ago, was dismissed by Government as reported but was afterwards reinstated arrived this afternoon. To-morrow morning I shall know what was result o f his conference with Korniloff.
