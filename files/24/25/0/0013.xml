C.HJHEIGN O^ICE.31st August, 1917.IIEXTRACT FROM WAR CABINET 21%x*neral Sarrail.x9.     The above report led to a discussion on the question of General Sarrail.     It was felt that his.refusal provided an. additional reason for pressing once more upon the French Government the necessity for withdrawing General Sarrail.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs attention to the strong objections enter-by the Serbian Military Authorities to General Sarrail as Generalissimo on the Salonicadrew tained
front.     The Serbian Government had suggested that General Sarraii1s staff did not inspire confidence, and that they should be replaced &quot;by a more efficient staff, the composition of which slight c-:- nroernational.     It was important. f,:.T.L the Foreign Office point of view, that some action of this nature should be taken, and Mr. Balfour suggested that it might he advisable to send out to Salonica an influential British Mission to investigate and report oh the situation.With reference to ?ar Cabinet 205, Minute 3, the Prime Minister stated that he had not found an opportunity to raise this question with the French Kinisters during their recent visit to London.The War Cabinet considered that it would be difficult to send a soldier as Head of the Mission, as he would have to be an officer of high rank, and bis mission was bound to be regarded with suspicion.     They considered that it might be desire^ble to send someone of poJ itical status, for the express purpose of encouraging the Serbians, although&quot; in&quot; she course of his visit he would no&apos;doubt, obtain valuable information.The question was adjourned for later consideration, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertaking to consult in the meantime, his Department furcher on the subject.
