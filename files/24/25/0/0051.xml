Horses and Mules for Greece, Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.By a decision of the War Cabinet W.C.225(14) of 23th ;Aug^st,1917t I was authorised to give such assistance in the way- ?f equipment to Greece as was possible, bearing in mind that we might be required to find similar articles for another of our Allies, v;. ... A /conference&apos; is sitii&amp;g in Paris at the present moment to deal ^withJ these matters, and I am sure it will be found that the demands of Greece, especially in the way of guns,, are far, in excess of anything we oan possibly find.M, Thomasy when he was over here the other day, spoke to me oh the subject of Horses for.Greece.   I have been into the! question with the Quartermaster General and for the information of the War Cabinet I circulate a\memo ran dum which &apos;-, he has given me which shows our position as tegpg&amp;% horses.It will be noticed that the French iii Ifteifc allotment have laid down that we should&apos; supply the n.eavy ^Draught Horses to the extent of 5,450,   This is thi class of horse which, at the present moment, it is almost impossible to obtain in this country without interfering with essential work, suofc- ae Dock work,etc. It therefore at once becomes a question of shipment, but even then, as will be noticed from the Q,M.G&apos;b report, it will take us some months to purchase.     As, however, the guns will not &quot;be forth-coming for some time, probably we could get the horses by the time they, have got the guns available.I should like the Cabinet1 s instructions as to whether we should give the 450 suggested by the Q.M.G. and start the purchase of the remaining 5,000, the necessary shipping being found by the Shipping Controller.DERBY,5th Sept ember, 1917.
Minute &quot;fey- the quarter Master General,Ik&apos; IIIWith regard to the French demands for horses, etc.for Greece,.i.e,-,(1.506 Ri ding Horses, to., he f ou^d by the Erench (3.500 Light Draught HorseS , j ,. ,,, (l,950 Mules to be found by ,,all with the necessary harness:--. -In.England we.have only barely, sufficient to keep the unitg in Prance in the Pield,&apos;  It is one of our greatest difficulties procuring the right stamp of Heavy Draught Horse,. as the purchase;: is^increasingly difficult in Great Britain^ /We     j- have also Egypt and&apos;Salonika to supp.i.y, and have only about&apos; 4.500 &apos;\  n England to keep up 72,000 in Prance, whilst the Salonika wastage is about. 100 a month, yand Egypt about 200 a month,--  n Salonika theestablishment of Heavy- Draught Horses is 1,592 and there,are actually the^eV 1,427;.&apos; if the Heavy Batteries now .due &quot;for Egypt go from Salonika without horses,- there are no horses for them in Egypt, and they would be useless, :jand America as arranged with General Smut s, for whi ch we have &apos; shipping. ... c-1 do not (Juite understand whether&apos; they mean really. ... Heavy-, Drauisht Horses.. as 5;450. is a very heavy demand for this : class.    We.might;give now 450., but our 4, 500 here means only &apos;&quot; about two Months reserve in. hand, and at is the chief demand at -&apos;;;.&apos;.: the moment &quot;from -Prance,.  &apos;,All I can suggest is that - the 5.000 balance&quot; should be imported- from Iforth-America (if wa can,new the Americans&apos;, are coming into-the&apos; field),.  -Tliis means shipping (5 or 6 ships), plus upkeep, say 300 a month.
