Colonel Jones1338 y0From :-To:-Assistant Military Attache D.M.I.Petrograd, 1st September, 1917.1319.2i o 3It is reported that in view of the disgraceful behaviour within the last few days of certain Russian units on Roumanian front General KOTniloff has telegraphed to Kerenski insisting on the introduction of the measures he recommended at the Moscow conference..The Government claim to have strengthened its position by the conference so there can be no excuse for their not acting vigorously now nor can they have any excuse for their not acting strongly enough, as they did after the rising of July.On the other hand, each of the opposing parties, into which broadly the conference was divided, claims to have won the day, and I can find no two people whose opinion agrees as to the result of conference.   The only point on which everyone is agreed is that Kerenski came out of it very badly.The value or otherwise of the conference cannot be gauged until it is seen what measures the Government intend to take as the result,I interviewed Rodziahko on his return from Moscow today.   He said that the Conference has shown that the difference between the two parties, into which Russia is at present divided, cannot be settled and the position which the Left adopts is leading the country to civil war.   It also shows that the Left parties are not fit to direct the destinies of Russia but that the Right parties have not sufficient power to take matters into their own hands.    There were rumours before he left that the Government wished to remove Korniloff and appoint Yudenich In his place.   He says there cannot and will not be acounter-revolution as no party is sufficiently strong or well enough organized to do so.   The present situation is more serious than it has ever been, and had he known that the revolution was going to result as it had he would never have been in favour of it,Savinkof has informed representatives of the Press that he is still at the head of the War Ministry.   He has remained in Mini-i-Pter of w*ar&apos;s official house all along.In view of alarm which was caused by withdrawal on Riga front, some days ago, Cin C, 12th Army has sent a telegram to Minister of War stating the Germans have concentrated a considerable force opposite Riga, but that they have confined their activity so far entirely to reconnaissance.
From:- Assistant Military Attache To:-    D.M.I.&apos;   PETROGRAD 2nd September, 1917,1320.German activity seems&quot; to be on the increase here. There have been several instances during the last few  ays of munition factories being destroyed by fire.   Artillery department tell me that 10 such factories have been set   on fire and that they are all. undoubtedly German ^1 work,$ (2.The artillery Depot at Kasrfn has been destroyed/ resulting in destruction among other munitions of&quot;2,000,000 3 inch shells and 12,000 machine guns.   . The powder factory there has also been seriously damaged.     X am informed that head of Petrbgrad&apos; fire brigades has twice informed G.H.Q. of existence of a German plot to destroy all factories doing Government work&apos;,-The counter-espionage department in Russia is in a chaotic&quot; state and I heard yesterday that the Council of workmen and soldiers deputies insists on knowing what is done by this department.   Composed, as it is., of some Very doubtful characters,- the Council can easily destroy the&quot; efficiency of any counter-espionage work. ,* Hot understood. &apos;&apos;0 On-R.Volga. 445 miles&apos; East of; Moscow.
