ME C RE&apos; TIf. 1975, TOl   CABINET..&apos;IRISH   OATS.^Proposed purchase by Army on Term3 of GovernmentGuarantee.&apos;     :v  .(Memorandum by Mr. Joseph Davics)The Chief Secretary for Ireland in a Memorandum to the war Cabinet Of August 19th, (G.T. 1776) stated:-/&quot;Questions involving much risk of conflict and loss are now about to arise.   The oat crop which will be unprecedentedly large was produced   under a govern-mental guarantee of a prioe of 38/6d, but this is not for new oats.   The oats are ordinarily threshed and marketed immediately after harvest when they are too green for carriage in bulk.   Means of storage do not exist, and the Irish farmer has   never learned to stook his corn crops.   So it may well happen unless the representatives of the Government - preferably the Army buyers - are able to make arrangements abouvnandling of this crop that a great deal of food will be sacrificed and a large claim set up under the guarantee of prices, I am told these   arrangements have been discussed but not decided upon and that they could very easily be made&quot;The Oat crop of the years 1913-1916 has been:-1913        ..    ..    ..     18,887,000 cwt.*1914 .. 18,082,000   &quot;1915 ......    ..      19,600,000.   &quot;1916 ........     17,814,000   &quot;The net exports of the above period averaged l  millioncwta., leaving for consumption in Ireland an average of 17-J-million cwts per annum.The 1917 crop is estimated at 24,250,000 cwts., so that, assuming the home consumption remains at figure of 1913-31916. 6$ million cwts will be available for export.   The prospects are,: however, that owing to the restriction of maize imports into Ireland,  (V*hich have averaged 13 million cwts. a year) the home consumption of oats will be so much above the average that the War Office experts estimate that of the 1917 crop not a relatively snail quantity will be available for export.Following the Chief Secretaryfs letter, Lord Kilner took the matter up with the War Office and the Irish Office,   the Irish Office ask for authority to issue a Notice in the following form:-&quot;The Government have informed the Department that the War Office will buy oats in Ireland for Army purposes on and after November 15th, when this year *s crop will be fit for Army purposes and that they will be prepared to pay 38/6d. per quarter of 312 lbs. on rail or in store for clean sound oats in good condition&quot;.
The War office after full enquiry into the position have expressed their approval of this Notice being issued subject to the War Cabinet authorising them to incur such additional cost of storage, handling, kiln-drying (where necessary) and possible loss as may result from purchasing oats on the 15th Kove-iDbar which will not be in a condition to be chipped to England or Prance before the end of December.The Pood Controller and the ipieat Commission are also in agreement with the foregoing. ,The following is submitted for the decision of the WarCabinet-: - -S^-C. ;--v-^:       (l) That the Irish Department forthwith issue the following .-&quot; notice: -&quot;The Government have informed the Department that the War Office will buy cabs in Ireland for Army purposes on and after November 15th,.when this year?s crop will be fit for Army purposes and that they will be prepared to pay 38/6d. per quarter tfj 312 lbs. on rail or in store for clean sound oats ( in good condition&quot;.(S) That the Army Council be instructed to take suoh action i as may be necessary to carry out this notice.10, Downing Street.
