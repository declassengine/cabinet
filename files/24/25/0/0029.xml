/JL 203(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty*8Government.)0.2?. 1928.     THE WAR CABIM.With reference to what passed at War Cabinet this morning;      I think it desirable that the War Cabinet should have before it the most reoent views of the Admiralty as tp the importance of an advance on the Belgian coast line.       These were set out at length in the First Sea Lordfs memorandum of the 18th June.       I would, however, quote as follows&quot;......... if the Germans made full use of&quot;the possession of Ostend and Zeebrugge, our &quot;position at the Eastern end of the Channel&quot;would be almost untenable.      These two ports &quot;provide harbours which, together with Bruges, &quot;can accommodate a very large number of &quot;destroyers, and, if the Germans were to concen-trate destroyers at the ports up to the full &quot;limit of their capacity, there is no doubt &quot;whatever that if they realised the strength of their position they could with great ease raid the Straits of Dover so effectually as to &quot;make almost a clean sweep of our forces.&quot;X X X X X&quot;Unless we are able to occupy Ostend and &quot;Seebrugge by next Winter, it will be essential &quot;to increase very largely the strength of the Dover &quot;Force, and, in order to do so, we shall be &quot;forced into improvising a safe and defended &quot;anchorage for some .of the additional vessels &quot;owing to the limitations off Dover.   We can
&quot;only provide additional vessels at the expense of &quot;some other service, either from the Grand Fleet &quot;or from destroyers engaged in anti-submarine work &quot;in convoy and the protection of trade.&quot; .It will be seen from the First Sea LordTs further memorandum dated to-day, copy of which is attached hereto, that on account of certain modifications in H.M.Se &quot;Furious&quot; we hope to be able now to provide three 18&quot; guns which, together with some IE&quot; guns and an advance of 5 or 6 miles on the coast, would go along way towards making the harbours of Ostend, Zeebrugge and Burges untenable.It is not of course for the Admiralty to pronounce upon the prospects of the present land offensive in Flanders.        In view? however, of the possibilities of an extended use by the Germans of flotillas of surface and submarine craft for raiding the Channel, and the enormous benefit which would accrue from a six mile advance on the coast now that these long range 18&quot; guns are available, I think that the Cabinet would wish to know of this- the latest aspect of the situation.      From the Naval point of view I would urge that every possible effort be made to advance in Belgium at least to enable these long range guns to be   placed so as to command the Belgian harbours used by the Germans..The importance to the Navy of these two harboursbeing rendered useless to the Germans, and the possibility soof doing^even before Ostend is reached, are matterswhich I venture to submit may have anriapirtant bearing uponthe Cabinet1s decision in the matter now before it,E.C.

This document is the -property tf His Britannic Majesty1s Government.&apos;* MOST SECRET.4   First Lard:With reference to the conversations which took place at- this morning&apos;s War Cabinet en the subject tf s supply if heavy guns te Ifaly, and the passible effect tf such action en the Flanders offensive, it is desirable te take intt cen-sideratien the following new feature which has arisen since my Memorandum of the l8Jh. of June, 1917, en the subject of the Uerth Coast of Belgium was written.Owing to the removal of the forward 18&quot; gun from H.M.3. &quot;Furious&quot; during the process of converting that ship into a Seaplane carrier, this gun and the spare gun for the &quot;Furieus&quot; are available for ether purposes. It is in contemplation to remove the second 18&quot; gun from the &quot;Furieus&quot; as one gun is of little use, and it is desired to fit her with a,&quot;Flying on&quot; deck for aeroplanes.   Thus there are now 2-18&quot; guns, and may shortly be a third, available. Arrangements are in progress for providing them with land mountings.   If an advance of about six miles can be made on the Belgium coast we should be able to mount these guns in a position where they would be within comfortable range of Zeebrugge and Bruges. The operation of these guns could be assisted by that of 12&quot; naval guns on land mountings.   The 18&quot; projectiles weigh more than lj tons and the fire of three guns of this calibre, assisted by the fire of the 12&quot; guns, would go a very long way to render both Zeebrugge and Bruges untenable as naval bases. -The; supreme importance&quot; of denying the use of these bases to German torpedo craft, in order to safeguard our cross Channel communications, has already been pointed out.J.R.J.3/9/17.
