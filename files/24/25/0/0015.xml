Telegrams-&quot; SHIPM1NDER, VIC, LONDON.&quot;111 iAny further communication on this subject should be addressed to The Secretary, -^a^-^     Ministry of Shipping,A BT^v^N.      St&quot; ^ames&apos;s Park&apos;-/^NS. London, S.W.&apos; 1,and the folld%ink number quoted.CO(This Document is the Property of ^^^^ .MINISTRY OF SHIPPING,1 September, 1917.88II: ft I OSir,In continuation of my letter of the 18th ultimo, I am directed by the Shipping&apos; Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows :-1.    CONVOYS -(a) Homeward bound Convoys. 30 homeward bound convoys have arrived up to date, consisting of 479 shijDS of 3,297,000 tons deadweight, and 12 convoys of 195 ships of 1,358,100 tons are on passage home.    Since the last report there have been two casualties by enemy action, namely, s/s &quot;SYCM0HE&quot;, which parted from the convoy-in a gale before arriving at the rendezvous, proceeded in accordance with existing trade routes and was torpedoed three days afterwards.    The s/s &quot;BONIFACE&quot; parted from convoy throe or four days after leaving New York, proceeded in accordance with trade routes, and was torpedoed off the North of Ireland; the remainder of the convoy came in round the South of Ireland.     There have been no casualties due to marine peril.(b) Outward bound Convoys.   8 convoys consisting of 81 ships of 488,000 tons deadweight have been escorted through the danger zone.    There have been two casualties due to enemy action, viz:- the s/s &quot;R0SC0MM0N&quot; and &quot;DW0NIA&quot;, forming part of an outward bound convoy of 18 ships which had been assembled in lough Swiliy to be convoyed through the danger zone and dispersed in the Atlantic. It is reported that when the ships had got out of Lough Swiliy andwere liecretary, pr Cabinet.
were in process of being formed into convoy, they were attacked by two submarines which sank the two vessels mentioned, and also damaged the armed merchant cruiser &quot;LANGASTRM&quot;.    The ITMCASSBIM1&apos; succeeded in returning to Lough SsriHy with the other ships, and the destroyers then proceeded to the rendezvous for the incoming convoy for which they were appointed.2. rajTMi toiinme.A statement is attached showing the employment so far as known of the tonnage belonging to the principal neutral maritime nations.    The difference between the total of which we have information and the total fleet on the respective register is accounted for by (a) the fact that the latter includes vessels which though technically ships are not of use as cargo carriers and (b) the employment of a certain proportion either in local or colonial coasting trade.NQBg&amp;Y  It will be seen that roughly half of the Norwegian mercantile marine was, at the time to which the return relates, trading either with the United Kingdom or with Prance or Italy. Twentyper cent was trading in American or neutral interests ^ a large proportion of these being fruit steamers Or other specially constructed vessels not particularly suitable for ordinary trade.An agreement has now been arrived at with the Norwegian Shipowners Association whereby substantial control over all tho Norwegian mercantile marine, except that required for maintaining Norway^ essential overseas supplies, is secured by His Majestyfs Government..    Steps are being.taken to acquire, by requisition or charter, practically all the Norwegian ships in the North Sea trade and in return enough British ships will be placed in the trade between the United Kingdom and Norway to carry 230,000 tons of coal and coke monthly.&apos;SWEHEN. About one fifth of Swedish tonnage was either in United Kingdom ports or trading with the Allies while rather morethan
than one quarter was laid up,We have not yet arrived at any general arrangement with Sweden with regard to the employment of her mercantile marine though some signs have-been shown recently that she may be willing to discuss some arrangement.      We succeeded in bring-ing sufficient pressure to bear upon Sweden to induce her to facilitate the egress from the Baltic of the British ships laid up there and this is in progress.Nc British ships go to Sweden. DIBlaBK.   One quarter of the Danish tonnage was employed in trading with the United Kingdom or the allies.In agreement has recently been concluded whereby so Ion as 200,000 tens deadweight of Danish tonnage are chartered to His Majestyfs Government for trade in European waters we will allow 100,000 tons of coal to be exported monthlv to Denmark.7 ..... - x */Apart from this tonnage no Danish ship may be chartered for voyages other than to or from Denmark, Iceland or Paroe Is. without the approval of the Inter-Allied Chartering Executive and this provision will enable the allies to secure the services of Danish tonnage in safe trades such as the carriage of coal to Atlantic and South American depots.No British ships go to DenmarkHQELAKD.   The amount of Dutch tonnage in the direct service of the European allies is very small though there is a large amount-trading bet?feen Dutch Colonies and the United States.We have no general agreement with Holland on shipping questions though negotiations have been in progress to secure a control over Dutch tonnage employed in safe trades similar to that obtained under the Danish agreement and the employment of a substantial block of Dutch vessels for the service of the Belgian Relief Commission.     The Dutch Government have however asked for a definite undertaking that the United States willallow
allow them thoir normal supplies.The British ships which trade to Holland are few in number and are wholly occupied in carrying cargoes either for the Belgian Belief Commission or such as serve a definite allied interest when they arrive in Holland, e.g. coal and raw materials for the manufacture of margarine.OirAlX   Here again the proportion of national ships in British or allied service is very small and we have as yet no tonnage agree-ment.     Negotiations on the basis of the Cortina agreement have recently been rc-opened &quot;by the Spaniards but it is not possible at the present moment to estimate the chances of any Spanish tonnage materialising under this.GBSBCB    Practically all the available Greek ocean going tonnage is in the service of the allies, subject to a limited right of the new Greek Government to the employment of sufficient tonnage to secure their essential food requirements.i 3. . fflNiMD.luring the week ended 27th August, the sum of  997,000 was paid for compensation for total loss in the case of requisitioned ships, making a total to date of  16,482,022 paid since the 1st iVprii.I am,oir,Your obedient Servant, (ogd.) John Anderson.
