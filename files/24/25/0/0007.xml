This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.) r4SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,. Department of Information.-&apos;------- -&apos; Frv/oos&apos;;      - &quot; Weekly Re-port on Italy,     IX 1      V: August 31st, 1917.The month of August marks v satisfactory extension in Italyof moderate and conciliatory views in regerd to war-aims.     IThilethere is no drawing back from the essential points originallyaccepted in principlo by the Allied Governments, extravagant of expansionschemes/are discountenanced and a desire manifested that Italy&apos;s action should be brought into full accord with the anti-imperial-istic policy of the Allies, Poreign Relations,The more or less openly expressed alarm and distrust caused by what Lord Robert Cecil and Mr. Balfour said and did not say in the last week of July led to full exposition in the press of the reasons which make a practical dismemberment of Austria essential to the future security of Italy.     The cordial reception given to Sonnino in London, the confidence generally felt in his ability to sustain adequately the Italian case, the imuression -oroduced &quot;bytthe speeches delivered at-the Queen&apos;s Hall and at the Serbian banquet by British Ministers, and the evidence of British friendliness in economic and financial matters, have dono much to allay the sus-picion - not confined to anti-British quartersT of leanings towards a separate peace with Austria in London and Paris.     M. J?oincare&apos;s visit to the Italian front and the conversations for which it gave opportunity are regarded as having contributed to a complete under-standing with Prance.     At the same time a good deal of diS3atis-faction is clearly felt with the reserve maintained concerning the positive results of the discussions which took place in london.The Jugo-Slav question has been brought very much into the foreground by the publication of the Corfu agreement, and in this
connection a demand is made by the more moderate elements for the publications of the agreements concluded in the Spring of 1915 between Italy and the Allies as a preliminary to Italy&apos;s declara-tion of -Var.     A friendly understanding with&apos; Serbia and the Jugo-Slavs must be based, it is urged, on a clear recognition of Italy&apos;s necessities in the Adriatic and an equitable delimination of territory,     The unfortunate controversy which has raged on the subject has treated the question as an open one.     But the question has already been decided in the agreement with the Allies of 1915 when Italy made generous concessions to the Slav aspirations.     The publication of this agreement would acquit the Italian Government of all Imperialism and it would silence the extremists of both sideScV/ith reference to the Corfu agreement Italian public opinion falls into 3 categories.     (l)   The extreme Nationalist - which is uncompromisingly hostile and sees in the agreement a manoeuvre of the Jugo-Slavs - all austriacanti of course at heart and anti-Italian - to hedge against the chence&apos; of an Austrian break-down. (2)   The moderate - well set forth by the Corriere della Sera in an excellent series of articles - welcoming the agreement arid urging the Italian Government to lose no time in coming to a friendly understanding with the Jugo-Slavs and Serbs, but insisting that suchunderstanding must be based on a recognition&apos; of Italy&apos;s minimum 1 * &quot; theclaims in the Adriatic as sanctioned by tho Allies in/1915 agree-ment.     (3)   The Democrat-idealist - which not only welcomes the Jugo-Slav-Serbian agreement but is prepared to give up all claim to the mainland of Dalmatia (I&apos;Unita and other journals)The Nationalists argue that the Jugo-Slav element would vostly preponderate in numbers and influence over the Serbians in the Greater Serbia, whose policy would consequently be anti-Italirn and pro-Austrian.     They would have the Jugo-Slavs form an independent
state or states, since then they would he less dangerous to Italy. The moderates re?ly that a separate Jugo-Slav State would inevitably be absorbed either by Austria or by Serbia - more probably the former - and that this solution is out of the question;   that the practical choice lies between union of the Jugo-Slavs with Austria or with Serbi?,   and that there can here be no question for Italy. If certain sections of the Jugo-Slavs make extravagant claims, they may safely be left to the Allies who have no intention of going back on their pledges to Italy.Bo announcement of the evacuation of Jannina has, we believe, appeared in the Italian Press.     According to the Western and Gnreral. Report of August  2nd, the Italian promise had not then been ful-filled, on the ground that there was still one French officer left in Thessaly. Internal Conditions.The peace-at-any-price movement hardly seems to have gained strength during the last few weeks.     The Socialist Congress at Florence can hardly have gained credit with the country by its white-washing of &quot;la Balabanoff&quot; and of Grimm, disowned by the Russian S6viet, and it brought further proof of the split between. Turati the leader of the Parliamentary group and the Executive.     The position of Turati may have been strengthened by the explicit statement made in his speech at Turin by the Russian delegate Goldenberg that though the Russians wished to bring the !7ar to an end they &quot;did not desire peace-at-any-price&quot;    The anarchical con-ditions prevailing in Russia must also be unfavourable to the -oropa-ganda of the Official Socialist party.     Some uneasiness is expressed regarding the wide diffusion of the text of the Papal Note in the villages and among the troops.     Oiolitti&apos;!s speech at Cuneo on the occasion of his re-election to the Presidency of the Provincial
Council, taken in connection with the comments of &quot;La Stampa&quot;,. was obviously an attempt to harness the rising tide of democratic and internationalist feeling to the interests of his faction.     It was at once denounced by the interventionist press, but coming so sonn after &quot;La Stampa1 s&quot;e.rticle at the time of the Secret Session (noticed in the Weekly Report on Italy, of July 6th) it seems to she that Giolitti and his faction consider that the state of public feeling is favourable to an attempt at recovery.     Giolittc^s connection with Caillaux, obscure but certainly existent, makes it advisable to watch his movements, though there seems to be no immediate danger of his bid for popularity succeeding.     The re-lations of the Giolittian element with the Church are noted by Sir Rennell Rodd in his despatch of August 18th, where attention is drawn to the warm support given by wLg Stampa&quot;to the ?opefs peace proposals; this attitude of the Giolittian organ being in strong contrast with that of most other journals of standing, excepting naturally the Clerical.     On the whdsle the reception given by them to the proposals is more polite than might have been expected, but distrustful and depreciatory.     The despatch referred to encloses a summary of press comments.     The Ambassador is assured on good authority that the proposals are due to the independent initiative of the raope and not to any prompting from the Central Emnires.     He is of opinion that they are likely to have considerable influence with certain sections of the Italian public and to add to the embarassments of the Government.Writing on July 29th, Sir Rennell Rodd discusses the talk prevalent in certain circles in Rome of a coming revolution in Italy.     He is not inclinec to attach much importance to it but cbviously regards a revolutionary movement as not altogether impossible.     &quot;It is perhaps inevitable&quot; he writes,  &quot;that recent
events should have pro&amp;uced a recrudescence of revolutionary-suggestion in this country.     But, if all goes vrell, if no disaster occurs to the Italian arms, and if the c&amp;use of the Allies takes a favourable turn within a reasonable time, I do not think there is any necessity to attach great importance to these currents. These conditions have since been fulfilled both by the brilliant successes of the Italians on the Isonzo and by the French and British on the Western front.     The enhancement of Italian prestige and the increased confidence produced by the recent con-ference in London have still further contributed to the improve-ment of internal conditions in Italy.It will not perhaps   be out of place to draw attention here to a-point raised by the Morning Post Correspondent in Rome (Horning Post August S8th) who points out that the cemetery by the pyramid of Cestius (in Rome) which contains the graves of Keats and Shelley is still Germo.n property and invites the British Government to take action.J.CP.31. 8. 17.
