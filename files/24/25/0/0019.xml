9L.g&apos; The Order contains provisions for the limitation of retail prices in : ,,\:.., .-..:-, conformity with the- foregoing wholesale&apos; maximumr prices.   The: effect j,:ioi:-these provisions.is: that, the.retail butcher .fnust; hot sell meat.over ,;- - ,vn        the counter at prices; which, in the aggregate; exceed the:, price paid, by &apos;       irim:for such meat by more than 2\d. per lb.,; or 20 per cent:, whichever ;      :;; ;-   is the less, Ms accounts being balanced over fortnightly periods.Out of this difference the retailer wrill have to pay the expenses of . .;.. carriage, wages, rents, rates, and all the other expenses of his business, :        including his personal remuneration.Further, the Local Food Control Committee are empowered to fix schedules of maximum retail prices for the various joints with which the butcher will in addition be required to comply.   These schedules may vary from district to district according to varying local conditions. . : -     A butcher is required to keep posted in his shop in a conspicuous -., position the price which he actually charges for the various cuts and : joints, and these prices must comply with the conditions set out above.Except in Ireland, the responsibility of enforcing the retail prices and of securing that the charges made by the butcher do not exceed those, allowed by the Order will rest on the Local Food Control Committees.Conferences.- .... i .   .. j - *On ,August 23, Lord Rhondda and Mr. Clynes received a deputation from the Houses of Parliament Agricultural Committee, when the subject of cattle prices was discussed. The deputation expressed regret that earlier notice had not been given, and suggested that the January price should be raised to 65s. and that the 60s. price should not become effective until June or July.Further deputations from Scottish and Irish agriculturists were received on the same subject. Lord Rhondda said that he proposed to prepare a considered statement .on the subject, but that unless it was proved that the 60s. January price would.wholly deprive farmers of their legitimate profit, he was not at pjresent prepared to alter it.Lord Rhondda and Mr. Clynes received a deputation representing &quot;The Operative Bakers and Confectioners Union&quot; on August 29th.The Union has taken steps in the London district to ballot its. members on whether they would cease work on some later date to secure the abolition of all night work in bake-houses.The operation of the Twelve-hour Stale Bread Order has had the effect of preventing night work in many bake-houses, and the men are anxious to prevent night work in all bake-houses. If the Order referred to were removed the men fear that the bake-houses would revert to night work. There is much difference of opinion on the value of the Order from the standpoint of Food Economy.The men stated that after the result of the ballot they would communicate with the employers intimating that at the end of a fortnight the men would discontinue night work, but gave the assurance that in sending word to the employers they would intimate their desire for a joint meeting. The employers also have stated their willingness for a joint meeting, and this will no doubt take place.Control of Supplies and Prices.[Allied Purchases. The following cablegram was sent to Lord Northcliffe and Mr.. Hoover on August 29 : - -&quot;Meats and Fats Executive agreement signed by France Britain agreed -by Italian Delegates.and being submitted to Italian Government for, signature. Executive empowered to deal with bacon. ham lard butter cheese and such ....... other, animal products.or articles of food not dealt with, by any other Inter-allied authority as may be specified.   Vegetable oils and fats specially excepted. &apos; Agreement provides for pooling all purchases to be concentrated in one organisation as soon as possible &apos; provided any existing organisation for &apos; purchase of frozen meat on behalf of, any Government shall not be superseded &apos; without assent of representatives of Government concerned.&apos;   Agreement makes each Ally responsible for finance and tonnage for their respective -     -    pjurchases otherwise closely-follows wheat Executive provisions.&quot;
Bread and Flour-On and after Monday, September 17, the maximum retail rii^j of bread will be 9d. forthe 4-lb. loaf and corresponding maximum prices will be fixed for the sale of flour for domestic consumption. The above prices refer to transactions for cash over the counter. A reasonable additional charge may be made by the retailer if he gives credit to his customer or delivers the bread or Hour at his customers house.The wholesale price of Government Regulation flour and wheatmeal will be 44s. 3d. per sack of 280 lbs. at the mill door, subject to a discount of 6d. per sack for cash within seven days. Imported flour will be sold at higher prices according to quality, such prices to be fixed by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies. The price at which special and proprietary brands of flour and bread can be sold will be fixed by the Ministry of Food.Food Control Committees will be authorised to grant provisional licences for the charging of retail prices in excess o  those specified vvhere they are satisfied that bread and flour cannot be retailed at those prices. Such cases will be reported to the Ministry of Food for examination by the Cost Accountants of the Ministry, and the licence will only be allowed to continue if it appears to the Food Controller that the claim for a higher price is justified.Sugar. A loss of 7,500 tons of sugar through Enemy Submarines has to be recorded being a full cargo from Java and a part cargo from Mozambique. Since the system of convoying incoming vessels was established some weeks ago, there has been a gratifying immunity from such losses ; and it is possible that the losses of last week may be due to the greater difficulty of applying the system to isolated vessels coming from the East, than to the more regular arrival of ships from America.Owing to the difficulties of Mauritius in providing for the pa.yment of necessary supplies for the Island, purchased in India, it has been arranged by the Treasury, the Colonial Office and the India Office, that a part of the sugar crop should be diverted to India; and, in consequence, the estimated quantity to be brought to the United Kingdom has been reduced from 160,000 to 120,000 tons. The deficiency will have to be made good from Java from which source it seems probable that at least a further 100,000 tons will have to be procured ; as, under arrangements made with Mr. Hoover, the amount of sugar to be drawn by us from there, until the new crop comes on the market, in January, is not to exceed 50,000 tons; and it is extremely doubtful whether it will be possible to obtain even that quantity.Tea. The Shipping Controller has promised to provide 12,000 tons of shipping monthly for tea from India and Ceylon, 10,000 for civilian and i!,000 for military requirements. A scheme is under consideration for the purchase locally in India and Ceylon on behalf of the Government of all tea exported to the United Kingdom. The Government of India has promised co-operation.The Tea Control Committee is considering special arrangements necessary to ensure supplies of tea to munition areas and canteens.Bacon. Several conferences have been held with importers, wholesale dealers and retailers, with a view to developing the scheme for the complete control of the trade. &apos;   &quot;v The mission to Denmark to which reference was made in the last Report has been arranged, and will, start during the present week. -- -Potatoes.---The. control of the potato crop will become effective on September 15, and a scheme is under consideration for enabling potatoes sold by the grower at 6/-. a ton to reach the consumer at Id. per lb. This will involve the regulation of traders&apos; profits and the elimination of unnecessary handling ; an attempt will further be made to equalise the cost of inland transport. Wholesale dealers and retailers will each be licensed and only licence holders will be allowed to sell potatoes, nor will one wholesale dealer be allowed to sell to another.Local Food Control. In addition to those specified in last week&apos;s report Divisional Food Commissioners have been appointed for the following districts :  Newcastle-on-Tyne. Manchester.Home Counties (North). Reading.The total num ber of Food Control Committees of which notification of appointment has now been received is 1,579.A.   3659 5 a o
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.&apos;&apos;*&quot;.&apos; &apos;The most conspicuous feature in the accompanying tables and report is the heavy drop in imports due to the great decrease in the. supply of wheat and flour. Other cereals also show a decline. As was noted in previous reports, some falling off was anticipated, bat the figures of last week present a startling contrast to those of the earlier part of the summer, and in consequence the estimated wheat stocks show a decrease below those of the preceding week.Imports.The aggregate imports of the principal foods was only 173,000 tons last week (Table A) ; this is 37 per cent, below the previous week and 25 per cent, below the average for this year so far. The fall is mainly attributable to a very small importation of wheat and flour, only 61,300 tons as compared with 112,300 tons the week before, and with 198,000 tons the average of five weeks to August 4th. Other cereals fell back to 51,630 tons; in the case of barley the average for the year so far is 54 per cent, below that for the corresponding weeks of 1917, it is 14 per cent, below in the case of oats, while maize is 16 per cent, in excess.Of sugar and glacose 3S,50U tons were imported, an amount which is very nearly equal to the average for 1913 and 38 per cent, above the average for this year, though it is. very much less than the unusual quantity received in the previous week.Over 10,000 tons of beef were imported, nearly twice the average for the year; mutton was also above the average. Both beef and mutton show a fall of 15 per cent, when the first 34 weeks of this year are compared with the same period in 1916.The imports of bacon and hams were 40 per ^cent. below the previous week. Margarine was considerably better, but still below the average. The quantity of cheese imported, 1,160 tons, is little more than a quarter of that in the corresponding week of last year, but the total imports for 34 weeks are 25 per cent, above 1916.::    Copies of the Food Control Committees (Constitution) Order, 1917, and the LocalAuthorities Food .Control Order- (Nov. 2), .1917, have been.....circulated to all. FoodControl Committees whose appointment has been notified. .....Memorandum M.G.3, dealing with the question of representation on Food Control Committees of Co-operative Societies, has also been circulated.  ..Enforcement of Orders.Messrs. Gunn &amp; Co. and other defendants were prosecuted at Liverpool for selling Irish potatoes at a higher price than the maximum permitted by the Potatoes 1916 Main Crop (Prices) Order (No. 2), 1917. The matter had been the subject of Parliamentary Questions. Messrs. Gunn &amp; Co. were fined 1801. and 30 guineas costs. The other defendants were fined sums varying from 10Z. upwards.Messrs. Barr &amp; Son were prosecuted at Bow Street on the 23rd August for illegal sales of seed potatoes. They had received a licence permitting them to sell certain selected seed potatoes at the prices named in their catalogue and had abused the licence by selling varieties not named in the catalogue at prices above those permitted by the Orders. The illegal profit proved was 29L, and the firm was fined 151. aud 10Z. 10s. costs.;    &apos; A Cardiff greengrocer was fined 100Z. for selling potatoes at illegal prices.&apos; v   A Loughborougli butcher was fined 91. for re-entering in the LoughboroughMarket cattle bought for slaughter at Leicester.,. Fines amounting to 96L 10s. were imposed on 17 defendants at Luton for obtaining sugar by false declarations.Two Metropolitan bakers have been fined for selling new bread; an offender was fined hi. for baying raspberries at 50/. a ton; another was fined 11. for feeding a carriage horse on oats ; a grocer was fined 10L for selling food on illegal conditions.A metropolitan police magistrate has announced his intenting of inflicting imprisonment in cases where fines have produced no satisfactory results.

The supply of meat (Table B) at the London Central Market has again increased, but is still 5^- per cent, below the quantity in the corresponding week last year. At Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow the supplies were greater than in the previous week and higher than last year.The supply of fat cattle at 51 markets (Table C) was greater than in the previous week, and continues to be well in excess of the numbers in August and July last year. There were not so many fat sheep in the markets as in the&quot; week before, but the number was 5 per cent, more than in the corresponding week last year.Wholesale Prices.The prices of cereals (Table D) show little movement. British wheat has fallen 2s. and oats lid. per quarter, but barley has risen Is. Sd.English mutton has fallen another 2s. Qd. to 128s. Qd. per cwt.; it is still 22 per cent, dearer than a year ago, and 76 per cent, above the price of July 1914.There are no other changes of importance in the prices of food. Irish bacon after rising for five weeks is stationary.Cotton-seed after remaining at 380s. per ton for 15 weeks has fallen to 340s. Cotton-seed cake which has fluctuated between 325s. and 330s. for five weeks has fallen to 315s. Linseed cake has fallen 10s., but is still 10s. higher than a fortnight ago, and palm-kernel cake has fallen about 4 per cent.
