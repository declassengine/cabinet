V&quot;.;&apos;&quot;Allied Purchases in America-Mx. Andrew Caird, who is acting for Lord North-cliffe during the latters absence in Canada, has cabled that Mr. Hoover has promised that the Allies shall have their full, share of meats and fats, and that, so far as necessary for this purpose, supplies to neutrals will be curtailed./Lord Rhondda has agreed to Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposal that the balance of the Cuban sugar crop should be purchased as to one-third for Allied and; as to two-thirds for American requirements. He has also agreed that future purchases of raw and refined sugar should be m. the hands of a-New York Committee of.five persons, of whom he will appoint two..,-       . . &apos; .&apos;      &apos;The Treasury has sanctioned an immediate credit of $ 1,000,000 in favour of the Government Agent for the purchase of American bacon.   Pending the.completion of . arrangements for the extension of this credit, a further sum of $5,000,000 has been borrowed from the Wheat Commission for this purpose, as the supplies of bacon are &apos; running short. .    -.:-.&apos;(v;./.:- -&apos; -Bread and Flour. The details of the arrangements made by the Food Controller in connexion with the introduction on September 17 of the. 9d. loaf have now been, publicly announced. They indicate the intention to form a register of flour factors and provide for compensation to holders of existing stocks of flour, such compensation to be calculated on the basis of the difference between the old and the new prices. Steps are being taken to determine the remuneration of millers while under Government control. &apos; . -&apos; -Meat and. Cattle-The Meat (Maximum Prices) Order came into operation on September 3. There has been a slight .but general reduction in the retail prices of : meat. : . , -   &apos; - &quot;&apos; v: , - &apos;      &quot;The arrangements made for the purchase of cattle in the United Kingdom for the feeding of the Army during the next few months have- been publicly announced. Lord&apos; Rhnndda has pointed out that the factors mainly responsible for the higher cost of producing beef are the cost of stores and the cost of feeding-stuffs. The farmer who rears his own calves should have ho difficulty in producing fat beef at 60s.        ;,-     .    . &apos;    .  , .     - &apos;Oils and Fats. A Crushers&apos; and Refiners&apos; Trade Advisory Committee has been established, and by their deliberations a satisfactory uniform crushing cost (including profit) has been, arrived at for practically all seeds and nuts.The Crushers also came to a decision that as from September 4th they would reduce.both cotton-seed cake and linseed cake 11. per ton, and palm-kernel cake 3L per ton. With regard to distribution, negotiations are taking place with the Corn Trade Association, who are working out a scheme, for rationing feeding stuffs at considerably reduced prices to farmers. Purchases of Egyptian cotton seed have already been begun by the Control Board set up by the Egyptian Government, and the first shipment will be madean a few days by a boat now berthed at Alexandria.Negotiations are taking place with W. African merchants for the purchase of W. African ground nuts and palm kernels. As a result of urgent appeals from ) Mr. Clemen I el, plans are being discussed for joint buying of oilseeds and nuts by the British, and French. Governments, on the principle of pooling purchases and fixing uniform selling prices. Terms of agreement are being considered by an inter-depart-, mental Committee summoned by Lord Rhondda at the request of Mr. Bonar Law.
Sugar. 6a August 4 Sir Charles Bathurst received a deputation of ten members of the Manufacturing Confectioners Alliance who raised the following points : (a) The insufficiency of the existing allowance of 25 per cent, in view of the heavy.demands of the Army and Navy Canteen Board ;(b) The great injury which is being done to the small retail trade owing to the &apos; shortage of supplies ; .. (c) The inadvisability of placing manufacturers under the &quot;Local Food Control Committees;... (d) The grant of import licences for Swiss chocolate.   .: &quot;Sir Charles Bathurst replied that if the deputation would furnish him with exact .&apos;; information&apos; as to the extent to which the demands of the Army and Navy Canteen Board had increased, he would see whether anything could be&apos; done to reduce the demand, fie held out no hope of an increase in the 25 per cent. He explained that :. the Swiss chocolate was allowed to be imported at the urgent request of the retail trade. As regards the Local Food Control Committees, he stated that they would have no discretionary powers in dealing with the applications of manufacturers who were subject to the Sugar Restriction Order, and that it appeared impossible at the present stage to exempt the manufacturers from local control.  vTea. The Food Controller has issued a reassuring&apos; press notice on the subject of. tea. ; Shipments, of tea in July were over 10,000 tons, and it is hoped that this quantity will be maintained in future months.: This is in addition to approximately 2,200 tons for naval and military requirements. &quot;The quantity of tea offered for sale this week was substantially larger than recently but still less than that required&apos; to meet the normal demand. -,.&quot;;,   &apos;.&apos; &apos;   &quot; &apos;* * &apos;  - \-Satisfactory arrangements have been made to meet the requirements of canteens in controlled.munition works.Some cargoes of tea have recently reached-Liverpool, and were dealt with at the weekly auction, satisfactory bids-being obtained at about a halfpenny under current prices, ;:;vv:; v--.^;v;.v&quot; &apos;-.&quot;&apos;.&apos;;..&apos;. &apos;     &quot;..&apos;.-/-.Local Food Control.. * . &quot;&apos;.

That the fall is&apos; due mainly to &quot;&apos;&apos;-&apos;;;:    seasonal influences is shown by comparison with that which took place .&apos;.-&apos;/. &apos;&apos;-&apos;..&apos;-.&apos;-;&apos; in the corresponding period of 1916.   The decline&apos; last year was-greater, \ amounting to 4 per cent., whilst that in the&apos;present year is only 2\ percent. .        &apos;&quot;\    -; /.&apos;&quot; &apos;--&apos;--. --&apos;:&apos;-&apos;/.-; -.7-(3) The rise in the supplies of meat coming into the four dead meat markets, and -;-     so far as cattle are concerned, into the 51. principal markets for live &apos;..:&apos;;:.

Compared with the average imports of 35 weeks from December 31st, 1916, they show a&apos;decrease of 77,832 tons, or 34 per cent.&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;.--:     ;As regards particular articles, there is a marked fall in the imports of oats and maize. In comparison with those of the previous &quot;week, the import of oats shows a decline &quot;of 14,790 tons, or 68 per cent., while the decrease in maize amounts to 12,970 tons, or 45 per cent.      - s&apos; &quot;  - -- &apos;, The imports of wheat are 74,484 tons, or 66 per cent, below the average weekly imports for the 35 weeks of this year, while those of wheaten flour are 12,1S3 tons, or nearly 98 per cent, above the corresponding average.

The stocks are 22 per cent, less than those held by the same retailers four weeks ago, and a fall of 12 per cent, was recorded in the previous four weeks. The fall is,, oi course, attributable to uncertainty as to their position when the price of bread is fixed. In England and Wales the stock is equal to less than two week&apos;s supply ; in Scotland it is nearly four weeks and in Ireland above four weeks.The available information as to the consumption of meat points to a continued increase. The supplies of fat cattle at 51 markets show an increase of over 8 per cent. Information for all the four dead meat markets is available only for the week ending 25th August and shows a rise of b\ per cent, in the total supplies. Supplies at Smithfield during the week ending 1st September indicate a further increase of 10 per cent.A.  3899-1 Bjoint decrease- is 62,301 tons, or 50 per cent, on the average, The two together, however, are considerably -higher than those secured- in thV corresponding week of 1916. \ &apos;/&apos;   ;&apos;&quot;        ::        -    &apos; - &apos;4   &apos; &quot;Imports of sugar and glucose are 5,354 tons, or 14 per cent, below those of the preceding week, but are still 5,747 tons, or 21 percent, above the average for. the 35 weeks of the present year.. . /.. &quot; &apos;; Consumption of Flour and Meat.The final returns for retailers&apos; consumption for the four weeks ended August 18th-yield the same result as the preliminary estimate given last week, viz. :-Retail Consumption of Bread and Flour (as Percentages of theLevel of May 1917). &apos; 1      J      f    . 1916.,     1917.-4 weeks ended-Mareh 31st ;-    - 109,           -   .4    ,,      ,,    -April 28th - - - .99 1044                 May .26th- - - - 100 100:&apos; &apos;    ;&apos;4;   ,,&apos; &quot;&apos;  ,,   ; June 23rd &quot;-&apos; -: - &apos; 97%        9-1$.   4   ;, &quot;July 21st- - - - . -    99.        92.      .       4   ,,     ,,,    Aug. 18th - -    95         .891-. The August figures depend on 6,300 separate returns from all parts of the-country and represent a weekly use of 209,000 sacks.The fall in consumption has now continued without interruption for five months... Part of it is seasonal, and the seasonal drop from July to August last year was   -4 per cent.   This year the fall is.only 2?, per cent., despite the plentiful supply of potatoes.Table -H.- exhibits&apos; the: &apos;movement&apos; for several months in different parts: of the country. \ The. August figures are greatly influenced : by the Bank Holiday week (increasing BlaekpooTs Consumption very greatly)&apos; and a general holiday movement to the coast;. This is. shown in the table by the August fall in London and the big towns, which is clear both in 1917 and 1916 when August is&apos; compared with July; it i s more emphasised in the detailed figures,&apos; especially&apos;in the Midland towns. Apart from this, there has been very little change in any district in August.The stocks held by bakers and retailers are given in the following table : 
It is interesting to note the position- as to the supplies of ; home-fed meat entering into these totals. For the week ending 25th August the increase of supplies of home-fed beef on the four markets was 11 per cent, and that of home-fed mutton was.4 per cent.; the former percentage as to beef far exceeding the percentage increase for. all beef, while that for home-fed mutton was very little lower than that.for all mutton. ....      y.  . .        ; ;The supplies of home-fed beef entering these markets during the months of July and August may be stated in tabular form. , ...&quot;-.....-	Average Weekly Supplies.

During August the number of fat cattle steadily increased, while in the &apos;&quot;; case of fat sheep there was some decrease.   The total figures for cattle on the weekly average for August, 1917, stand in remarkable contrast to those for August, 1916, the ! -       weekly average for the current year being 16,371, while that for last year was 14,298.The number of fat pigs entering the 51 markets oh the weekly average for August is larger than; that for July. It is less in both months of this year than in the corresponding months of 1916, :Wholesale Prices.,  There is practically., no change to record on those of the .preceding: week. /Canadian bacon and Irish butter both show a further rise of about 1 per cent., .....    making a total increase of 6. per cent, and 8 per cent, respectively on the prices of a .   :    month ago.       y&apos;.;.;&apos;;&apos;-v-:&apos;.vv--.- \ &quot;       &apos;Wholesale prices of meat have fallen during the month of August, namely, English beef nearly. 6 per. cent.,: Argentine (chilled) slightly over 4 per cent., English, mutton 6 per cent.
