lUw iat-   r-iqsU C T-fqsj)A DECISION is required on the subject of the assignment to be made of steel plates between the Admiralty and other Departments, and in particular on the question of the supply of steel plates to Italy, with reference to which lam circulating herewith copies of recent correspondence with the Italian Ambassador and with Sir Edmund Wyldbore Smith.It is also necessary that the War Cabinet should be apprised of the limitations which, during the next twelve months, govern the shipbuilding programme. I have therefore prepared the enclosed Memorandum, which requires early attention.W. S. 0.September 5, 1917.[946-1]
Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1917.SECRET..  T- ICffh STEEL PLATES AND SHIPBUILDING.ON the 5th July last the late Controller of the Navy presented to the War Cabinet a proposal for building: 3,100,000 tons of mercantile shipping a year, for which purpose he required 36,667 tons a week of plates, sections, &amp;c. This, together with the warship and other demands of the Navy, raised the total Admiralty requirements to 53,144 tons per week, divided as follows:-.  -Mercantile -        .. .. .. ..

V v .. .    /. .. 8,000Constructional    - .. &apos;-. .- .- .. 1.000These programmes were sanctioned in principle by the War Cabinet, and Lord OurzoUs Committee was appointed to examine them in detail. It was not, however, appreciated that the limiting factor in shipbuilding was not primarily raw steel nor labour, but the capacity of the rolling mills to produce ships&apos; plates. This serious fact prevents those large transferences of steel from shell making to shipbuilding which formed the basis of the late Controllers proposals, and it renders impossible, no matter what measures are taken, the attainment of the rate of mercantile shipbuilding which was in contemplation.During the month of June 1917 the average weekly total product of ships&apos; plates (nj- inch and over) from all the- British rolling mills amounted to about 22,700 tons; Of this the Admiralty received a weekly average of 15,740 tons. In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet early in August 1917, orders were given to feed the rolling mills to their fullest capacity. Owing to the fact that we are living from hand to: mouth in regard to iron ore, any misfortune such as the non-. arrival of our full supplies from Spain, or the Cumberland strike, causes an immediate dislocation of particular furnaces with consequent reactions on the rolling mills in association with them. There is no question of a general pool of ore or pig-iron or steel which can be speedily shovelled this way or that way according to the fluctuation of the national need. The element of mterohangeability is surprisingly small and the process of conversion painfully slow. Steel is made in different grades and composition for different purposes, and should the steel supply fail, say, for the plate-rolling mills, a supply of shell steel would not meet the requirements, as it is unsuitable for the purpose, it being necessary to change the working of the furnace in order to make steel of a suitable quality. Subject only to practical and physical difficulties, everything is.being done and will be done to keep the existing rolling mills constantly fed to their; fullest capacity.A large extension of steel works and of the rolling mills has been planned, and is already far advanced. The following figures: show month by month for the next twelve months the estimated increasing production of ships&apos; plates as the different mills are successively put into operation. It will be seen that our total ships&apos; plate production will rise gradually from its present weekly average of, say, 22,600 tons per week to 33,800 tons in August 1918 :-Plates only.Estimated average at end of- -  Tons per Week.August.   1917 .. .. .. .. ....      22,600September   ,,   .. .. ... \. ..      24,770October     .,,  ..        ..        .... ..      26,110 -November &apos;     .. ...... ..      26,310December    ,,   .. .. ,, .. ..      26,310January   1918 ... .&quot;. .,; 27,810February     ,,   .. .. .... 28,810March .,&apos; ., 2^,810April ,,   .. .. .   .     ..&apos; .. ..      28,810May &apos;.. .......       28,810June .,,  .. ...... .. ..      28.810July .        ,,   .. .. .... .. 28,810August       ,1   .. .. .... -      ..-     33,810It can be assumed as rough estimate that the demand of 53,144 tons of steel for total Admiralty requirements comprises two-thirds, or 35,400 tons, of ships&apos; plates.   It will be seen that even if the whole output, actual and augumented, of the British. [946]        -.
rolling mills were assigned to the Admiralty the weekly average of ships&apos; plates would not reach the level of their requirements, viz., 35,400 tons, even when all the extensions at present planned are working at full capacity, and that on the twelve months, September 1917 to August 1918 inclusive, there would be a deficiency of about 350,000 tons of ships&apos; plates on the quantity required by the Admiralty for the 3,100,000-ton mercantile ship building programme and their warship construction.But it.is of course not possible to assign the whole output of our plate mills to the Admiralty.   I state below what &quot; other services &apos;.-.&apos; must be supplied from this limitedfund.   They may, broadly speaking, be divided into four classes : ;. ; Demand in tons. per week.1. Ministry of Munitions, War Office, and other departmental needs        - - 3,7912. Allies: France and Italy, &amp;c.                  ...         .. 1,8783. Extensions to steel works on which the extensions of the rolling mills.themselves depend ..         ..         .. 1,0004. The vital industrial and administrative needs of this country, and alsospecial demands of departments         ..         ..      (not less than) 5,000Under this last heading there is a large accumulation of necessities which have not been met for many months past owing to our efforts to meet Admiralty require-ments. This of course cannot continue indefinitely to be ignored. So far as the Allies are concerned, I have induced the French, instead of increasing their demands as the)&apos; wished, to reduce them from 13,500 tons of plates per month in July to 7,930, and subsequently to 6,095 in August. We are under a written pledge to Italy to complete the building of the 100,000 tons of shipping agreed to by Mr. Montagu in October 1916. Only 12,000 tons of ships&apos; plates, at the rate of about 450 tonB a week, are required for this. Compared to the Admiralty demand this item is almost inappreciable, and it seems a pity to break our promise and leave the Italian ships half completed for the sake of so small a saving.Still, both the French and Italian supplies of ships&apos; plates can undoubtedly be cancelled by the War Cabinet if they desire to do so. In this case, however, I should have to request that the Foreign Office undertake to explain the position to our Allies, as the decision would raise issues quite outside the area of mere munitions supply.The demands of the other services have already been the subject of the most severe compression. I have had these items again scrutinised by a strong committee, who advise that the irreducible minimum which must be provided for other departmental services and for general requirements outside such departmental services is 7,000 tons a week at the present, increasing later to meet other demands which have been held up while the rolling-mills&apos; capacity increases. I am advised that it would be impracticable to trench further upon this. In any case, the gains which could be effected in this sphere would not substantially alter the main facts of the situation.I therefore propose to endeavour to meet the &quot; other services &quot; (non-Admiralty) as far as possible by distributing among them a minimum of 7,000 tons a week of plates on the present basis of output, the future increase being handed over proportionately to the Admiralty for mercantile or warship construction. This will yield the following results:-		Minimum		Estimated	Allocation to	AdmiraltyPlates Only.

The above figures govern absolutely shipbuilding possibilities for the next twelve months. To realise them all, the existing rolling mills must be constantly fed to.their fullest capacity. No new roiling mills can within that interval be brought into operation. If the proportions between mercantile and warship building set out in the Admiralty memorandum of the 5th July are adhered to, it follows that a weekly average of only 13,800 of ships&apos; plates, instead of the expected weekly average of 24,440 will be available for the merchant marine, provided the proportion laid down between mercantile marine and other Admiralty requirements is maintained. It follows, therefore, that the total amount of merchant shipping that could be built within this period will be much less than the estimate made by the Admiralty of 3,100,000 tons.It is necessary that this fact should be realised by all Departments concerned, as it influences all our calculations with regard to food and tonnage during the latter portion of this period. Arrangements are being made to provide the quantities of sections, sheets, and of rounds, squares, and flats, which are proportionate to the weekly and monthly outputs realised in plate. Arrangements are also being made to divert from shell and other services the necessary steel for rolling the above sections, &amp;c.The consequent and progressive reactions of this grave diversion upon other steel services will be traced, so far as possible, in my general statement on the Munitions programme.Meanwhile it is hoped that the Admiralty extensions to the ship yards and their requirements for labour in the ship yards will be strictly proportionate to the available supplies of plates, and that men will not be drawn from other vitally needed services into the ship yards, or for ship yard extension, in advance of the time when they can be kept constantly employed.w. s. c.I have not dealt with the proposal which was adumbrated at the last War Cabinet meeting on this subject to utilise the small plates which are rolled in certain mills for a special form of ship construction. A large proportion of the produce of these mills is absorbed in making mines for the Admiralty, and what is left is required for most urgent and necessary military services. No relief that would Le appreciable can therefore be obtained from this source, and, moreover, I understand the method of shipbuilding which it was contemplated to adopt presents many disadvantages.With regard to the statement made by Mr. Hodge, the late Minister of Labour, at our last meeting, to the effect that a proportion of the rolling mills were not employed at all and were standing idle, has been carefully examined. Officers of this Department have had the advantage of going fully into the matter with Mr. Hodge, and he has written to say that &quot;the best practical method of increased output&quot; is that suggested by the Steel Department.o
