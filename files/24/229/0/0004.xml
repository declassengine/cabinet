Paper No. 1053-B.*)Foreword. Under instructions from the Cabinet the Secretary has informed us that the Cabinet would be glad if we would submit to the Committee of Imperial Defence our remarks oii the assumption on which the annual Estimates of the Defence Services clTG Del sed, viz., that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years. At the time we received this message we already had the subject under consideration and had decided to deal with it in our Annual Review of Imperial Defence Policy, which we submit herewith.I. Introduction.IN the year 1931 we did not present our usual Annual Review of Imperial Defence Policy. In the early part of the year the whole of the ground had been covered comprehensively in a Memorandum on Imperial Defence as affecting New Zealand, in which our commitments were dealt with in detail (C.I.D. Paper No. 358-C), and in a series of Reports prepared by the Staffs of the three Defence Departments for the Three-Party Sub-Committee on Disarmament. In these circumstances the Committee of Imperial Defence (253rd Meeting) accepted our view that the moment was inopportune for an Annual Review, which would cover only the same ground.2. Since that time (June 1931) important events have occurred which have a bearing on Imperial Defence. The fall of the   Sterling off the Gold Standard has brought into existence a National Government. The Disarmament Conference has met under the shadow of an international situation which is generally accepted as being disquieting, and to the accompaniment of fighting in Manchuria and at Shanghai, which the combined efforts of the League of Nations and the United States of America have failed to avert. The general malaise in Europe, sufficiently serious in itself, has for the time being been overshadowed by this menacing situation in the Far East, which sheds a sinister light on the basis of our existing arrangements for Imperial Defence. The situation in India is still fraught with grave potentialities.3. In these circumstances we feel that the time has come when we should bring to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence the present situation of Imperial Defence. We have not thought it necessary to follow the precedent of past years in inviting the Government Departments concerned in the political[6623]* Also Paper No. CCS. 272.b
side of the Imperial Defence to furnish us with reports. This has been found to involve delay, which we think would not be justified. The team-work between Government Departments is now so satisfactory, and the liaison arrangements are so complete, that we have thought it sufficient to consult the Permanent Secretaries of the Departments principally concerned on any doubtful technical points.II. The Basis of Service Estimates.4. The most important matter to which we invite the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence is the basis of the Estimates of the Defence Services, namely, &quot; that it should be assumed, for the purpose of framing the Estimates of the Fighting Services, that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years.&quot;5. This assumption was adopted in July 1928 (236th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence). Before that time there had been a series of somewhat similar assumptions (e.g., in August 1919, applying only to. the Estimates of that year, when demobilisation was still in progress; in 1925, applying to Japan and to the Air Force scheme of expansion for Home Defence; and in 1927, applying to a European war). But, apart from 1919, it was not until 1928 that the principle became of world-wide application and that the date advanced from day to day.6. During the last fifteen months the assumption has been held with less conviction. On the 28th November, 1930, at a Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence held at the close of the Imperial Conference, which was attended by two Dominion Prime Ministers and representatives of other Dominions, misgivings were expressed as to the international outlook. The Prime Minister (Mr. MacDonald), after mentioning the assumption, added the following commentary : &apos;&apos; As things stood, it could be assumed that we should have ten years to recover our position. Supposing, however, something happened next year which made it appear the ten-year period was too long, we could reduce the time to a shorter number of years. The situation was that no Government could adopt a policy of peace coupled with disarmament on absolutely hard and fast lines. Every morning it was necessary to look round and see what changes had occurred during the night, and he felt bound to say, as one who saw all telegrams that came to his Government from foreign parts, that he sometimes felt rather anxious, although his disquietude was not such as to make him consider that present assumptions regarding defence should be changed. Nevertheless, he would not like to say that his views would be the same six months hence. In short, what was wanted in considering Defence was flexibility and not dogmas.&quot; (251st Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence.)7. In June 1931 the Foreign Office circulated a Memorandum in which the Basis of Service Estimates was examined in great detail (OLD. Paper No. 1055-B). In this Memorandum the assurance that there would be no major war for ten years was held to depend on the assumptions : &apos;&apos; (a) That during the next ten years no two nations will be involved in a dispute about a vital interest which pacific means have failed to solve; or(b) That of two nations involved in a dispute one will yet be so averse from war as to prefer to abandon its interest rather than fight; or(c) That of two such nations one will be so weak as to be incapable of fighting with any real hope of success; or, (d) That some organisation exists anxious and able to restrain intendingbelligerents; or(e) That a situation does not arise which creates a war psychology.If it can be shown that any one of these five assumptions can be validly applied to the next ten years the assurance in question can be maintained. If, on examination, all five of these assumptions do not appear to be safely tenable, the assurance that there will be no major war during the next ten years cannot with certainty be given.&quot;
On examination not one of the five assumptions was found to be tenable. The conclusion of. the Memorandum was quoted by the Prime Minister at the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 29th June, 1931 (253rd Meeting), as follows :  &apos;1 The deduction would seem to be that without any present change of policy the previous assumption may still be provisionally operative, but that the situation should be thoroughly examined in the light of developments in 1932 on which so much must necessarily depend.&quot;In reaffirming the original assumption the Committee of Imperial defence agreed &quot; That the situation should again be thoroughly examined in the light of developments in 1932 on which the continuance or. otherwise of the present policy must necessarily depend.&quot;8. When the assumption was adopted in 1928 the Foreign Office were careful to safeguard their responsibility. At the 236th Meeting Sir Austen Chamberlain warned the Committee of imperial Defence that while &quot; the Foreign Office had the greatest responsibility in advising the Government with regard to the decision of what period of peace might be expected, and that no more expert opinion on such a subject could be obtained anywhere, it would be impossible for the Foreign Office to give any guarantee in regard, to the advice it gave.&quot;*9. Our own attitude in the matter is indicated in the following passage from our Annual Review for 1928 (OLD. Paper No. 900-B), repeated in some subsequent Annual Reviews : &apos;&apos; We have not the smallest desire to go outside our province to criticise the political assumptions summarised in Part II as to the durability of these good relations. We recognise that, without some such guiding assumptions, the burden of Imperial Defence, calculated solely on the basis of an abstract strategical appreciation, would be well-nigh insupportable, and that there would be a grave risk of dissipating our resources in an attempt to achieve the impossible. We feel bound, however, to impress on the Committee of Imperial Defence how great a responsibility this places on those charged with the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs to warn the Committee of Imperial Defence of the first hint of a less satisfactory state of affairs, in order that the necessary adjustments in our defensive arrangements may be considered, the requisite preparations for which would require a period of some years to bring into effective operation.&quot;10. In addition to the above we drew attention to the light shed on the unreliability of such forecasts by Mr. Pitt&apos;s statement on the 17th February, 1792, a year before the outbreak of the long wars of the French Revolution and Empire, that-&apos;&apos; there never was a time in the history of this country when, from the situation in Europe, we might more reasonably expect fifteen years of peace, than we may at the present time.&quot;Some other examples, given in Appendix I, show that of all forms of political prophecy assumptions of the continuance of peace are perhaps the most unreliable..III. The Effect of the Ten Years&apos; Assumption as illustrated by events in the Far East.11. Recent events in the Far East confirm the experience of history and justify Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s disclaimer of responsibility for reliance on such guarantees, as well as of our own comment quoted above in paragraph 9. The difficult situation between Japan and the League over Manchuria cleveknped in September, 1931, out of a relatively clear sky. A few months later, the Shanghai episode occurred at the shortest notice. Following a Chinese boycott of Japanese trade and confiscation of Japanese goods, a fracas occurred in Shanghai on the 18th January which led to injury to five Japanese nationals, including two priests. The Japanese, who had become restive under the Chinese boycott, used this incident as a pretext for strengthening their naval forces at Shanghai, and for an ultimatum, which resulted in a clash on the 28th January. Within a week of this clash the international crisis developed to such a pitch that the British Ambassador in Tokyo was warning the Government (on the 4th* The italics are not in the original.[6623] b 2
February) that a false step might cause the Japanese to take some action which, would render war with the Powers almost inevitable, and that the Japanese Government was capable of replying to an application of Article XVI of the Covenant by reprisals or acts of war against the Powers. On the 11th February he warned the Foreign Office that co-operation with Japan &apos;&apos; may well entail fewer military commitments than &apos;&apos; thwarting her.12. The above events prompt inquiry as to our own readiness to face sudden aggression by Japan. The position is about as bad as it could be. Our naval forces in the Far East include nothing larger than 10,000-ton Cruisers armed with 8-inch guns. Most of these are moored in the Whangpoo River, together with the bulk of the international forces in the Far East, all of which are incapable either of effective resistance to a Japanese fleet of capital ships or of escape from this cul-de-sac, unless they receive sufficient warning to enable them to reach the open sea. The Hong Kong* gun defences are out of date, and such essential, elements as mines, anti-submarine defences, boom defences and aircraft are lacking. There are insufficient anti-aircraft guns. One of the three Battalions, of the peace time garrison of Hong Kong and part of the movable armament are at Shanghai. Singapore is not in much better case. The defences of Keppel Harbour are out of date and not sited to defend the naval base. Apart from one or two old 9-2-inch guns, which are unsuitably sited, and two 6-inch guns, a single squadron of 12 torpedo-bombers and a squadron of four flying-boats constitute the sole defence for the floating dock and large oil reserves. There are not enough anti-aircraft guns and no boom defences, anti-submarine defences, or mines. The garrison consists only of two battalions (one of which is a battalion of Burma rifles located at Taiping) and volunteer units. It is by no means certain that India could supply the force of one Division required as a war garrison, but even were it made available it seems certain that we could not bring it to Singapore in time. At Trincomali also the naval oil supplies required for the movement of the Main Fleet to the Far East are totally unprotected; there is not even a garrison.13. In a word, we possess only light naval forces in the Far East; the fuel supplies required for the passage .of the Main Fleet to the East and for its mobility after arrival are in jeopardy; and the bases at Singapore and Hong Kong, essential to the maintenance of a fleet of capital ships on arrival in the Far East, are not in a defensible condition. The whole of our territory in the Far East, as well as the coastline of India and the Dominions and our vast trade and shipping, lies open to attack.14. There is nothing new in this situation. The records of the Committee of Imperial Defence show that every year since 1919 the weakness of our position in the Far East has been brought to the attention of successive Governments in Reports by the Committee of Imperial Defence, its Sub-Committees and the Staffs of the Defence Departments, including, since 1926, our own Annual Reviews. The vital importance of Singapore, in particular, has been emphasised again and again both to the Government and to the Imperial Conferences of 1921, 1923, 1926 and 1930, with the result that New Zealand has made an important contribution to the development of the naval base. Nevertheless the Report of the Imperial Conference, 1930, included a recommendation in the following terms :  &apos;&apos; As a result of discussion between representatives of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, it was recommended that the present policy of the ultimate establishment of a defended naval base at Singapore should be maintained and that the Jackson contract should be continued. It was, however, also recommended that, apart from the latter expenditure and such as will be required for the completion of the air base on the scale at present contemplated, the remaining expenditure, i.e., that required for completing the equipment of the docks and for defence works, should be postponed for the next five years, when the matter could be again reviewed in the light of relevant conditions then prevailing.&quot;This recommendation was published in the Summary of Proceedings (Cmd. 3717).The above decision was assented to with reluctance by the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand.   The remarks of the latter,* Owing to Article XIX of the Washington Treaty fur Limitation of Armament, 1922, no increase can be made in the coast defeuces of Hong Kong, and action is limited to bringing the existing armament up to date.
-as set forth in the Report of a Committee of the Imperial Conference, are of interest at the present time and are quoted below : &quot; The Prime Minister of New Zealand, while accepting the proposals, did so with reluctance. He pointed out that the naval advice given to the Dominion, as indeed to the United Kingdom, over a series of years had been unanimous in regarding the Singapore Base as essential to any action what-soever by the Navy to protect the Territories, trade and shipping of the British Commonwealth in the Pacific. Without the Base the Fleet would be powerless in Far Eastern waters. While welcoming the various instruments for securing the maintenance of peace, he pointed out that they had not yet been subjected to any test that would justify relying on them in an emergency of the first order of magnitude. A study of the documents which had reached the New Zealand Government from the Foreign Office during the last few years indicated a good deal of unrest in the world, and made him hesitate to share without question the confidence felt by the United Kingdom Delegates in the sure maintenance of peace during the next decade. When such vital Imperial interests were at stake he felt that a risk was being run in relying on sufficient warning being obtainable of a deterioration in the international situation. He would have much preferred, if His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom could have found it possible, to proceed with the original programme, which provided the basis for New ZealancFs contribution. He appreciated the bearing on the question of the difficult financial situation, and for this reason did not feel entitled to press his objections to the point of disagreement.&quot; (C.T.D. Paper No. 354-C.)15. One of the most disquieting features of recent events is the suddenness &quot;with which Japan took action and the success with which her intentions were concealed, notwithstanding the glare of world-wide publicity to which she was exposed, first at the Assembly of the League of Nations, when the Manchurian episode began in September 1931, and later in connection with the Shanghai incident during the meetings of the Council and of the Disarmament Conference. If Japan were ever to prepare for operations of wider scope it must be assumed that these preparations would be concealed with equal care and her blows delivered with equal suddenness, in order to gain the maximum advantage at the outset. This would be consistent with the Japanese attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur, 48 hours before the outbreak of war in February 1904. While we have no reason to impute aggressive intentions to Japan, unless she is goaded into precipitate action, we must point out that the unavoidable concentration of interr national naval and military forces in a cul-de-sac at Shanghai and the weak state of the defences of Hong Kong and Singapore, to say nothing of the complete absence of defences for the naval oil fuel reserves at Trincomali, would provide a tempting opportunity to a Power in the mood to resort to an aggression.16. Normally, our Battle Fleet would require 38 days from the zero hour in which to reach Singapore. That is the basis on which the theoretical scale of defence of Singapore and the other ports in the Far East has been worked out. But in their present weak state these ports would be liable to capture, or at least to the destruction of their facilities, before the arrival of the Fleet. Unless these ports have been strengthened adequately and reinforcements arrive in time, on a calculation of reasonable probabilities we should have to assume either that they would be captured or that their facilities would be destroyed in the first month of a war. The position would then become one of the utmost gravity. Improvisations would be required on a vast scale before the Fleet could move to the East, and we cannot calculate how long would elapse before an attempt could be made and then under very adverse conditions to re-establish our naval supremacy in Eastern seas. In the interval our vast territorial and trade interests in the Far East, and our communications with the Dominions and India, would be open to attack. What the political reaction in India and in the various Colonies would be we leave to experts to determine. We have no hesitation in ascribing this highly-dangerous weakness mainly to the assumption that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years.17. We see no reason why the present anxious situation in the Far East should not continue for a long time to come.   The chaos in China is perhaps
(5greater than at any time since the end of the War. The Chino-Japanese difficulties are deep-seated, and neither the League of Nations nor the United States of America has made progress in their efforts at permanent conciliation. Japan has pursued her policy with disregard to both. At the moment the only likely solution appears to be a Japanese coercion of China, but that might easily create difficulties between the Powers and Japan.18. In these circumstances we urge with conviction that it would be the height of folly to allow our defenceless situation in the Far East to continue. We are submitting a separate Report on the defence of Hong Kong, Singapore and Trincomali.IV. The General Effect of the Ten Years&apos; Assumption on Our capacity to fulfil Our Commitments.19. The Far East has been taken above as an illustration of the effects of the assumption governing our Service Estimates, for the reason that in those regions we are conceivably within measurable distance of a catastrophe. As a matter of fact, however, we are equally unprepared for every major commitment that confronts the Services.   Some of these commitments will now be examined.20. Sea Communications. For keeping open our sea communications in the event of our being drawn into a war, our naval strength is &quot;definitely below the minimum strength which the Admiralty estimate to be necessary. In defensive material and modernisation of ships, and in the provision of Fleet Auxiliaries and their equipment, we are below the standard maintained by other Powers. The reductions of recent years have not been accompanied by propor-tionate reductions on the part of other Powers. The number of 50 Cruisers accepted for the strictly limited period of the London Naval Treaty (viz., until December 1936) compares with an Admiralty estimate of at least 70 Cruisers as the essential minimum of defence, and with 110 Cruisers in commission at the beginning and 116 at the end of the late War. As regards Destroyers, which are required for a variety of services and are the best antidote to the submarine, we are limited under the London Naval Treaty to 150,000 tons, equivalent to about 120 vessels of this class. At the present rate of construction, out of the 120 vessels which we will have in 1936, no less than 55 will be over-age. This force of 120 compares with 433 Destroyers which we possessed at the end of the late War, and which were more than amply employed. While other nations have increased their naval personnel, our personnel has been reduced to a point where even vessels in full commission are not now fully manned, and some 16,000 Reservists would be needed to put the whole Fleet in commission. In 1918 we had several hundred aeroplanes, in addition to many light airships, employed on anti-submarine duties round our coasts. At the present time we have only 15 aircraft at home suitable for this work.21. The deficiencies in our means for protecting our overseas communi-cations are the more disturbing when it is remembered that we are probably more dependent upon overseas supplies than at any previous time in our history.22. Coast Defence. For the protection of our oversea communications, properly defended bases for the Navy and secure harbours for the mercantile marine are indispensable. It is sufficient to say that all the world over, at home and abroad, in India and in the Dominions, our coast defences are in a position similar to those at Singapore and Hong Kong.23. The question of the best method of coast defence is at present under examination by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the Chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council. It is worthy of note that the claims of the Air Force, which led to the present Inquiry, were originally supported by the argument that, as war with Japan was unlikely for at least ten years, &quot; the present opportunity is a favourable one for ascertaining Avhether the gradual development of aircraft would prove effective as a means of defence &quot; (Paper No. C.O.S. 16, paragraph 6).24. Home Defence. Even the elementary obligation of Home Defence has been neglected.   Our naval bases and our commercial ports, with their vast.
-concentration of shipping and resources, are provided only with obsolete defences. The Home Defence Air Force of 52 Squadrons, the provision of which was announced in 1923 by the Prime Minister of the day as a step to be taken &quot;in the first instance&quot; and &quot; with as little delay as possible,&quot; has been completed only to the extent of 39- Squadroila, and of these no less than 13 are second-line non-regular units. Our first-line regular units at home have 400 aircraft, while the corresponding strength of France is 990. And this numerical inferiority is enhanced by other factors into which we need not enter here. The anti-aircraft defences of London have been completed only to the extent of less than half of the approved scheme, and many essential requirements are lacking. There are no anti-aircraft defences at any of our Naval Bases or ports at home, though, in the coming financial year it is proposed to take the first steps to remedy this situation and to provide nucleus establishments from the Territorial Army. In 1905, when dealing with the subject of invasion, Mr. Balfour, the then Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote as follows :  &apos;&apos; National independence must not be staked even in appearance on too nice a calculation of chances. We cannot sleep secure with only a bare margin of probability in our favour.&quot;As shown above, there is nothing approaching a bare margin to-day in the matter of defence against air attack.25. For major military liabilities, such as might arise under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty of Locarno, we are but ill-prepared. In 1914 we intervened on the Continent with six well-equipped and well-trained Divisions within the first month of the War. If to-day we committed our Expeditionary Force to a Continental campaign in response to our liabilities under the Pact of Locarno, its contribution during the first month would be limited to one Division, and during the first four months to three Divisions, arriving piecemeal; and except for the moral effect of its presence on the Continent it could have little effect on the fortunes of the campaign. Even for a War for the defence of India or our other Eastern Possessions, this rate of mobilisation, which cannot be exceeded, would place us in a very difficult position.26. The above is merely the barest summary, as we do not want to overload this Review with details. Fuller particulars are to be found in a number of Papers by the Defence Departments circulated to the Cabinet, or the Committee of Imperial Defence, or the Three-Party Committee, during the last twelve months (e.g., OLD. Papers Nos. 1046-B, 1047-B and 1048-B).27. Once more we have to repeat that the above situation is due mainly to the assumption that there will be no major war for ten years. It is true that consideration of finance would very probably have been operative in any event, but they would not have had behind them the same unanswerable argument against even really urgent proposals. Amid the colossal expenditure on development and unemployment, on which the May Report on National Expenditure sheds so searching a light, we find it difficult to believe that the relatively modest sums required to correct the more glaring defects in Imperial Defence could not have been found. On the 17th February, 1932, in the House of Commons the Minister of Labour stated that &quot; since 1924 the amount spent on public works to relieve unemployment, including road improvements and subsidise housing, amounts to no less than  700,000,000.&quot; Even 1 per cent, of this sum would have made a great difference to our defensive arrangements. But the assumption of ten years of peace has provided an insurmountable barrier to the execution of any policy in Imperial Defence, however urgent might be the necessity.V. Effect of the Assumption on the Armaments Industry.28. One of the most serious consequences of the assumption on which the Estimates of the Defence Services are based is its reaction on the armaments industry. After the War the Defence Services lived to a considerable extent on accumulated stocks, and even after those stocks began to become obsolete or &apos;exhausted, new orders and replacement orders in all the Services were cut clown
to a minimum owing to the assumption mentioned above. The result is that the armaments industry is shrinking to a dangerous extent. Important firms have been amalgamated with, or absorbed into, other firms, with an ever-lessening capacity. Plant has had to be scrapped, and, above all, skilled labour dispersed. Foreign orders, which before the War were attracted by the efficiency of the industry, are now for the most part placed abroad. This, however, has been due to other causes besides the decline of the industry; for example, the desire, in the interest of disarmament, to discourage the growth of foreign armaments, which for many years lost us orders and led to their being placed abroad; also to the system adopted abroad of State-aided long credits; and to loans granted by foreign countries in return for orders for armaments. If confronted with a sudden emergency we should in many respects be in a worse position than in 1914 in the-r matter of armament production, notwithstanding the careful planning of the Principal Supply Officers Committee.29. As an example, it may be mentioned that in 1914, just before the War, there were building or ordered in the United Kingdom no less than 111 warships of different categories, of which 23 were on foreign account. The total included 19 capital ships, of which 4 were for foreign account. In February 1932, the corresponding figures were 35 building or ordered, of which only 5 were for foreign account. In 1932 there were no capital ships; there were 4 Cruisers, none of them exceeding 7,000 tons. Apart from these and one netlaying vessel there was no ship larger than a Destroyer Leader. The loss of these orders must be a very serious handicap to the heavy industries which are now in such a bad way and in which unemployment is severe. In a letter dated the 21st November, 1931, addressed by the Chairman of the National Shipbuilders Security, Ltd., to the-Joint Secretary to the Economic Advisory Council, it was stated that over the ten years post-War period less than 50 per cent, of the facilities available for naval shipbuilding had been utilised. The same principle applies to other forms of armaments, except, of course, air armaments.30. Little notice has hitherto been taken of the relation between disarma-ment and unemployment. The armament industry is a not unimportant branch of the heavy industries. A year or two ago it was thought worth while, from the point of view of unemployment, to pass a special Act to enable the State to take part of the insurance of a new Atlantic liner. The cessation of work on the liner for financial reasons has had an effect on unemployment which, if small in comparison with the total figures, is none the less appreciable. This gives a rough criterion for judging the aggregate effect of the great diminution of orders-for armaments compared with pre-Vvrar days. Expenditure on armaments has little effect on the balance of trade, since the money is spent in this country, except for some of the raw materials. A large proportion goes on wages, including those of numbers of skilled workers who are kept in their regular occupations, instead of drawing Unemployment Insurance or being placed on relief works.31. We do not under-rate the difficulties that would confront the Government in placing large orders at a time when the Disarmament Conference is meeting at Geneva. We wish to emphasise, however, that a considerable part of the expenditure we have in mind would be devoted to such objects as coast defence and anti-aircraft defence, i.e., a defensive measure. In this connection we would invite attention to the following remarks made at the Disarmament Conference in the opening speech of Mr. Hugh Gibson, on behalf of the United States of America : &quot; Beyond and above this &quot; (i.e., maintenance of internal order) &quot; there is the obligation of each Government to its people to maintain a sufficient increment of military strength to defend the national territory against aggression and invasion.&quot;32. To conclude this section we strongly urge, in the interests of Imperial Defence, that it is important to keep alive the armaments industry, and that at the present time this can best be effected by placing orders for those urgent defects in our equipment which can be remedied without any suspicion of aggressive designs.
VI. Foreign Countries.33. In a message from the President of the Board of Education to schools, issued on the 2nd February, the date of the opening of the Disarmament Conference, scholars are reminded &quot; that neither knowledge nor wisdom is limited to any one country.&quot; That observation suggests inquiry as to the attitude of foreign nations.34. No major foreign Power has adopted an attitude towards armaments that bears any comparison with our own. No other country has based its arrangements on the assumption that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years. No large nation has neglected its defences to the extent that we have done. For example, the defended ports of the British Commonwealth are practically defenceless against bombardment by modern warships and against the growing menace of ship-borne air attack. Their defences do not include a single gun which is not out-ranged by a modern cruiser armed with 6-inch guns, or a single piece of ordnance of above 9-2-inch calibre. At only three ports abroad are there aircraft capable of offering any resistance whatever to an attack. Compared with this position, the coast defences of foreign Powers include the following guns of 10-inch and above : U.S.A. (including sixteen 16-inch guns authorised) 596Japan           ...          ...          ... ...          ... 258France          ...          ...          ... ...          ... 206Italy             ...          ...          ... ...          ... 180Russia          ...          ...          ... ...          ... 95Germany       ...          ...          ... ...          ... 76In addition, the following numbers of aircraft are located at oversea naval bases by foreign Powers : - U.S.A. *       ... ... ... ... ....   301France ... ... ... ... ...     99Since the War the United States of America have made provision for thirty-two 16-inch guns. France has voted  1,290,000 for coast defences at home ports since 1922; Italy intends to spend approximately  1,300,000 on coast defences during the period 1931-37; Spain has recently mounted eight 15-inch guns, and positions are being prepared for another twelve.35. Apart from coast defences, the following items are worth mentioning. The United States of America has brought to an advanced stage a vast and expensive scheme for the adaptation of its industries for purposes of war, Russia has in hand the organisation of even more comprehensive measures for the adaptation of the peace time industry of the country to the purposes of production of war material. France is spending on the defences of its eastern frontiers a sum in the region of  30,000,000; Belgium is allotting a large sum for the same purpose.VII. The Effect on Public Opinion.36. It seems extraordinary that we alone among the Great Powers should have neglected our defences to the point of taking serious risks. The reason is perhaps to be found in a difference in national outlook. In all the larger nations the belief prevails, and is fostered by Governments, that the first duty of a citizen is to defend his country and to make the necessary sacrifices for that purpose. The principle has been implemented by various measures, of which some evidence is given in Appendix II. In recent years, particularly since the adoption of the ten years&apos; assumption, not much lead has been given to the British people in this, direction, although military security is not inconsistent with a policy of peace. With the encouragement of the State an intensive propaganda of a different kind has been carried out in the schools, universities, churches, press, and, through the&apos; wireless broadcast, in the homes of the people. This propaganda has tended to-discourage personal sacrifice for purposes of national defence. Recruiting for the Army, in spite of unprecedented unemployment, is difficult. Taxation for purposes of Imperial Defence is felt to be doubly burdensome. In the wide-spread confidence in peaceful methods of settling all disputes there has grown [6623] c &apos;
up a deep-rooted belief that the Fighting Services oner a large scope for economies which, as the May Committee on National Expenditure observed, has drawn attention away from criticism of expenditure in other directions (Cmd. 3920, paragraph 187).&apos;37. Another result is a general ignorance of the facts and a spirit of complacent optimism that is not justified. These tendencies are illustrated by the resolution passed by the Executive of the League of Nations Union on the 12th February, 1932, urging His Majesty&apos;s Government to call a meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and, in concert with the United States and members of the League, to apply (on the lines of Article XVI of the Covenant) whatever pressure of a diplomatic and economic character might be necessary to re-establish peace. Apart from the secret warnings of our Ambassador, referred to in paragraph 11, it must be apparent to any well-informed person that such action might result in a resort to force by Japan, and that the brunt of a war must fall on the British Empire. Yet, in the prevalent ignorance of the real situation, the very organisation that has contributed so much to national unpreparedness is the first to- propose (at a time when Japan is particularly sensitive) action calculated to precipitate us into a war under conditions disastrous to the British Empire a not unexpected paradox.*38. We think it right to invite the attention of the Committee to the fundamental weakness to Imperial Defence involved in the present state of public opinion. But we cannot see how it is to be rectified so long as the assumption is held that from any given date there will be no major war for ten years.VIII. Conclusions and Recommendations.39. Our conclusion is that the assumption that there will be no major war for ten years is contrary to the lessons of history; has no -counterpart in any foreign country; and has produced the following dangerous results : (1) In the Far East a situation in which we cannot count on our being able to bring our sea-power to bear in time to avert the direst consequences in the event of an aggression by Japan. Before the arrival of the fleet Japan might well have succeeded in capturing or destroying the facilities and fuel supplies on which it depends for the final stages of its passage to the East and for its mobility after arrival. The destruction of these resources would delay the arrival of. the fleet and expose to depredation, for a period which we cannot estimate, our Possessions and Dependencies, our trade and communications, including those of India, Australia and New Zealand, and would produce reactions in India which we leave to experts to estimate. There are no signs of permanent improvement in the Far East, and ft would be the height of folly to perpetuate our present defenceless state.(2) A terrible deficiency in essential requirements for all three Defence Services and a consequential inability to fulfil our major commit-ments, e.g., for the defence of communications and trade routes on which we are more dependent than ever before; for the defence of our ports at home and abroad, as well as in the Dominions and India, the present defences of which are out-ranged by any modern Cruiser armed with 6-inch guns; for Home Defence, more especially against air attack; for all major military commitments under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Locarno Treaties.(3) The decay of our armament industry, a not unimportant branch of our heavy industries, in which unemployment is rife, and which are indispensable in any major war.(4) A state of ineffectiveness unequalled in the defensive arrangements of any foreign military Power.(5) A complete bar to the execution of any policy in Imperial Defence, however urgent.* Further illustrations are furnished by recent questions in Parliament and by a letter published in the &quot;Times&quot; of February 18 with the signatures of a number of well-known public men, including- Lord Cecil.
(6) A complacent optimism in public opinion, and widespread ignorance of the facts of the situation, which increases the difficulty of taking the necessary steps to ameliorate the situation.40.   We make the following recommendations : (a) That the assumption governing the Estimates of the Defence Services, that from any given date there will be no major war for ten years should be cancelled.(6) That a start should be made in providing for commitments which are purely defensive, including the defence of bases. First priority should be given to requirements in the Far East, on which we are submitting a separate Report.(c) That a decision should not be delayed until the results of the Disarma-ment Conference are known. Recent events in the Far East are ominous.   We cannot ignore the Writing on the Wall.(Signed)G. F. MILNE (C.I.G.S.).F. L. FIELD (C.N.S.).J. M.

APPENDIX I.The Ten Years&apos; Assumption. Historical Notes.THE following examples illustrate the difficulties of forecasting peace : I.Five months before the Spanish Armada sailed, Queen Elizabeth dismantled and laid up her fleet at Chatham, and, when the moment for action came, our cause was placed in jeopardy for lack of ammunition and supplies.See Fronde, English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century.In 1698, after the Peace of Ryswick, Qn(rn i......, &apos;s Parliament reduced thearmy to a peace footing of 7,000 men at a time when the French army was at a strength of 180,000 men.&quot; Optimism and pacifism reigned at the festal boards of Englishmen in the Christmas of 1700. But with the New Year these sentiments received a series of rude shocks.&quot;In January 1702, the army was recalled to the Colours. There followed the war of the Spanish Succession, lasting until 1713.G. M. Trevelyan, Blenheim.III.In 1774 &quot; The British reduced the number of seamen in the Navy, and took no serious steps to strengthen their forces in America.&quot;War broke out early in the following year. In 1775 Burgoyne wrote from Boston &quot; After a fatal procrastination, not only of vigorous measures but of preparations for such, we took a step as decisive as the passage of the Rubicon, and now find ourselves plunged in a most serious war without a single requisition, gun-powder excepted, for carrying it on.&quot; G. M. Trevelyan, History of England, p. 553.IV.Extract from a speech in Parliament by Mr. Pitt, on the 17th February, 1792, during a debate on Public Income and Expenditure: &quot; I am not, indeed, presumptuous enough to suppose that when I name fifteen years I am not naming a period in which events may arise which human foresight cannot reach and which may baffle all our conjectures. We must not count with certainty on a continuance of our present prosperity during such an interval; but, unquestionably, there never was a time in the history of this country when, from the situation of Europe, we might more reasonably expect fifteen years of peace, than we may at the present moment.&quot;A year later began the War of the French Revolution and Empire, lasting, with one short interval, until 1815.V.The great Exhibition of 1851 was pervaded by &quot; a sense of international goodwill and the brotherhood of the human race,&quot; which was celebrated by the Poet Laureate in extravagant terms : &quot; Breaking their mailed fist and armoured towers,&quot; &amp;c.Three years later the Crimean War broke out, and many of our regiments were still armed with the Brown Bess of Waterloo days.G. M. Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century.
VI.On the 6th July, 1870, Lord Granville received the Seals of the Foreign Office in Mr. Gladstone^ first Government.&quot;The previous day, between 3 and 4 o&apos;clock, Mr. Hammond, the experienced Under-Secretary of the Department, had told him that with the exception of the trouble caused by the recent murder in Greece of Mr. Vyner and his friends by brigands, he had never during his long experience known &apos; so great a lull in foreign affairs,&apos; and that he was not aware of any pressing question which Lord Granville would have to deal with immediately. By the time Lord Granville was addressing the House next day for the first time as Foreign Minister, the sky had already grown dark and the sea of politics was streaked with foam.&quot;Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, Life of L,ord Granville. A fortnight later the Franco-German War broke out.VII.On the 14th July, 1914, the Committee of Imperial Defence met and, among other routine business, approved the War Book, a new edition of which, by a coincidence, was just completed. There was no mention of any prospect of war. On the 22nd July the Secretary to the Committee was directed by the Prime Minister, according to the custom then prevailing, to take the Minutes to the King. On the way to Buckingham Palace he called at the Foreign Office to ask the Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, who was also Chairman of the Sub-Committee that was responsible for the War Book, whether there was any risk of its being put in operation. The news that day was reassuring, and Sir Arthur Nicolson considered that there was practically no prospect of the War Book being put into operation. On the following day the &quot;Times&quot; reported &quot;optimism in Paris&quot; and &quot; Berlin more optimistic.&quot; M. Poincare was in Petrograd; the Kaiser yachting in the Baltic. It was only on the 24th July, when the terms of the Austrian ultimatum were known, that the situation began to be regarded as serious, and on the 27th July that war was recognised as definitely on the horizon.VIII.In a Memorandum dated the 13th March, 1917, on his visit to Russia, the fate Lord Milner assured the British Government that &quot;As far as the purely political aspect of the matter is concerned, I have formed the opinion that there is a great deal of exaggeration in the talk about revolution, and especially about the alleged disloyalty of the army.&quot;The Russian Revolution broke out the same day.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, February 15, 1932.
APPENDIX II.Notes on the Attitude of some Foreign Countries towards Defence F rari.ce.ACCEPTANCE of compulsory military service based on the principle of equality of sacrifice.The existence of an elaborate &quot; law for the general organisation of the nation in wartime,&quot; passed in 1928. In the report introducing to the Chamber of Deputies this law the following passages occur : &quot; Directly or indirectly all citizens are concerned in war or interested in national defence. Beyond the duty of bearing arms .... is super-imposed the &apos; duty of national defence,&apos; which devolves on all and extends to every sphere of activity (economic, social, political, &amp;o). It is a duty for individuals of both sexes and of every age and estate .... for private associations and for public authorities.&apos;&apos;&quot; But the duty of national defence does not arise only during war itself; it precedes and survives war; it is permanent.&quot;&quot; Every citizen, every private association, every person who holds any public authority, must not only make war but prepare to make war.&quot;The law, as actually passed, provides for the requisitioning of the services of all Frenchmen in time of war, as well as of all articles necessary for national defence.   Women were excluded during the passage of the Bill.Registration of each man and earmarking in peace for employment on national work.The adoption of a scheme for the defence of the eastern frontier at a cost of approximately  30 million, to be completed by 1934.Insistence on security as the first principle of disarmament.Loans to foreign countries in return for orders to the French armament industry.Refusal to enter into the Naval Treaties of Washington and London. Tests of air-raid precautions for the civil population in great cities such as Lyons and Toulon.italy .Acceptance of compulsory military service.The creation of various organisations with the object of fostering the martial spirit, coupled with actual training in military subjects of the entire male population between the ages of 8 and 55, e.g., the Balilla-Avanguardisti movement; the p re-Military organisation, which all youths of 18 must enter for military training between the ages of 18 and 20; the Fascist militia, &amp;c. (C.I.D. 1034-B).The existence of a Committee on Civil Mobilisation.A draft law on civil mobilisation, introduced on the 6th May, 1931, the first article of which is as follows: &quot; In the event of mobilisation, all institutions, all citizens exempt from military obligations (including women and those under age), citizens, who, although liable to military service, may not be serving with a militar&apos; unit, must co-operate in the defence and resistance of the Nation, with the spirit of devotion and sacrifice of the combatants themselves.&quot;&quot; The non-observance of war discipline will be punished in accordance with the present law, unless other laws provide more severe punishment.&quot;Organisation of a &quot; Ministry of Corporations,&quot; i.e., a central governmental authority for the control of industry in peace or war.Penalties for failure to prepare adequate schemes for factory expansion for war production.Extended credits to foreign orders for armaments, particularly for warship instruction.
Insistence on parity with France.Public lectures on air-raids precautions for the civil population, and tests in great cities.Reorganisation of coast defences.Russia.Maintenance of the largest standing army in Europe. Military service compulsory, also pre-enrolment training. State control of industry, thus covering military aspect of the Five-Year Plan.Development of industrial areas in Urals and Siberia, inaccessible to foreign aggression.As regular and territorial formations can absorb only a portion of the available man-power, large numbers of men are trained &apos;&apos; outside the Army &apos;&apos; by means of short courses or musters at factories, collective farms, &amp;c.Standardization of industrial products, with a view to war purposes.Recent enquiries to lirms in Germany as to plans for war production. Likewise Arcos enquiry to firms in the United Kingdom.The principal object of the &quot; Five-Year Plan &quot; for the Industrialisation of Russia is openly described as the strengthening of the defence of the country.. Intensive propaganda as to the danger facing Soviet Russia from hostile bourgeois countries.Cheap periodicals issued for sale at book stalls, describing the uses of chemicals and machines in war, also in cinemas, theatres, &amp;c.Military studies and drill introduced into schools and universities.Several patriotic semi-military societies exist in Soviet Russia, of which the Osoaviakhim (Society for Air and Chemical Defence) is the most important. This society, which is stated to number some 9,000,000 members, is a voluntary body having as its object the popularisation of military training and study, particularly air and gas defence.In addition to organising lectures on military subjects and maintaining such institutions as laboratories, museums and rifle ranges, it assists the military authorities in training reserve officers, youths and conscripts surplus to the annual requirements. Women are trained as hospital nurses. It is entrusted with the task of instructing the nation in defensive measures against gas attack. A portion of its funds, which are collected by both compulsory and voluntary subscriptions, is devoted to the purchase of aircraft for presentation to the Red Army.Its value in training the mind and body of the nation in military matters is undoubtedly considerable.Voluntary societies, also, exist for the study of motor transport and wireless, whose members assist the military authorities by participating in army manoeuvres. Finally it is important to note that the junior branches of the all-powerful Communist Party the Comsomol and Pioneers are bidden to take interest in all matters military.There can be no doubt that the Soviet policy is to utilise all these organisations -as a means of militarising the spirit of the nation from youth upwards, and of training men, women and children in military matters.Germany.Insistence on freedom from the Naval, Military and Air Clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, except so far as other countries are subjected to corresponding disarmament.There is still no sign that there would be antagonism to a return to national compulsory service; emphasis is laid on its educational and moral value, quite apart from the German objection to a voluntary army on the grounds of expense.This natural predilection for some form of compulsory training is exemplified by the thousands of associations and clubs which keep up the martial idea by means of route inarches, camping, rifle shooting, &amp;c.The Nazi movement on Fascist lines.In the last six months, the Nazi militia has been organized in units and formations corresponding to the military hierarchy. These are given numbers corresponding to the regimental numbers of the former Infantry Regiments of the pre-war army, raised in the same areas.
The existence of semi-military organisations such as the Stahlhelm. Existence of organisation for Industrial Mobilisation.Co-operation of the Federation of German Industries, which, being the body-controlling German industry, means State control. Construction of the 10,000-ton pocket battleship.Secret attachment of General Staff Officers to industrial concerns for study, both at home and abroad.Armament firms or&apos; resources maintained in foreign countries.The widespread demand for rectification of the Eastern frontier and other provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, for which the use of force is often advocated.Lectures on Air Raids precautions for the civil population. Public tests. The sale of gas masks and appliances for testing their efficacy.Japan.Acceptance of compulsory military service.The recent attitude towards China and the public excitement resulting therefrom.Public test of Air Raids precautions for the civil population. Recent practical exercise in Industrial Mobilisation.It is reported, but not confirmed, that two exercises were held simultaneously, one to which foreign representatives were invited, while the real test was being carried out elsewhere.Heavy industries (i.e., armaments or capable of adaptation thereto) are controlled by Government.The United States of America.The following formula was endorsed by both the Republican and Democrat, parties during the 1924 Presidential campaign &quot; In the event of a declaration of war, the property, equally with the persons, lives and liberties of all citizens, will be subject to conscription for the defence of the nation.&quot;The great increase in the Navy since the war, notwithstanding the absence of any threat to security.Very heavy coast defences.Popularity of &quot;National Guard &quot; (corresponds to our Territorials) camps, and co-operation of firms and commercial associations in making them a success.The huge scheme for the mobilisation of industry for war purposes.Educational orders to firms in peace, i.e., testing a firm/s capacity to produce a specific war store, and thus giving them the necessary experience and data to turn over to war production. (This is advocated in many quarters, and in both military and trade journals, but there is no evidence that many such orders have been placed yet.)Publicity given to scheme for Industrial Mobilisation, both in press and public speeches of prominent officials and business men.An Army Industrial College exists for training officers in problems and: duties regarding supply in war.o

TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.THE SITUATION IN THE FAR EASTReport by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. IN paragraph 18 of our Annual Review for 1932 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B), we mentioned that we were preparing a separate report on the defence of Hong Kong, Singapore and Trincomali. We now submit, with a recommendation that it should be given the most earnest consideration, the attached report prepared by a Sub-Committee consisting of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, with the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence in the Chair.2. This report speaks for itself. Singapore, Hong Kong and Trincomali could not, in their present condition, be expected to hold out in the event of hostilities suddenly occurring with Japan, and as is shown in the Appendix to the report, even if authority were then given for all possible emergency measures to be taken, none of them except the installation of light guns at Trincomali and the provision of three air squadrons at Singapore could be completed until after the most critical period had passed, i.e., the time which must elapse before the arrival of the main Fleet in the Far East.3. In paragraph 39 of our Annual Review (C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B) we submit the following conclusion :  &quot; 39. Our conclusion is that the assumption that there will be no major war for ten years is contrary to the lessons of history; has no counterpart in any foreign country; and has produced the following dangerous results : (1) In the Far East a situation in which we cannot count on our being able- to bring our sea-power to bear in time to avert the direst consequences in the event of an aggression by Japan. Before the arrival &apos; of the fleet Japan might Avell have succeeded in capturing or destroying the facilities and fuel supplies on which it depends for the final stages of its passage to the East and for its mobility after arrival. The destruction of these resources would delay the arrival of the fleet and expose to depredation, for a period which we cannot estimate, our Possessions and Dependencies, our trade and communications, including those of India, Australia and New Zealand, and would produce reactions in India which we leave to experts to estimate. There are no signs of permanent improvement in the Far East, and it would be the height of folly to perpetuate our present defenceless state.....&quot;4. If the Committee of Imperial Defence agree with the above estimate of the situation, we suggest that approval in principle should be given forthwith for the adoption by the three Service Departments of the various steps indicated in the Appendix to the report, in order that the situation at Singapore, Hong Kong and Trincomali may be less serious than it would be in present circumstances, should a crisis actually occur. If approval in principle were granted we should suggest that the three Service Departments should be [6661] b
instructed to examine in detail the various proposals set forth in detail in the Appendix to the attached report and summarised in the conclusions below.5. In submitting our recommendations we would emphasize that, while the measures suggested would to some extent increase the security of our Far Eastern ports, they would not by themselves render the latter secure. The urgent need for providing protection on an adequate scale in peace time will still remain, and it is to be hoped that, as a result of the deliberations of the Coast Defence Sub-Committee which has recently been set up, it will be possible before long to institute programmes for the provision of a reliable scheme of defence which will avoid the necessity for; ill-organised improvisations.6. Further, we feel it our duty to invite attention to the fact that the proposals made above run counter to the agreement reached at the Imperial Conference, 1930, to the effect that work on the defences of Singapore should be postponed for the next five years. *The Committee of Imperial Defence will, however, appreciate that the Imperial Conference took place at a time when our defence policy was based on the assumption that there would be no major war for ten years from any given date, and when there was no indication of the situation which has since arisen between Japan and China. We venture to think that any proposals for strengthening the defences of Singapore and Hong Kong would, in present circumstances, be welcomed in Australia and New Zealand.Conclusions.(a) The emergency measures indicated in the attached report, which, subject to Conclusion (6), we recommend that the Committee of Imperial Defence should affirm in principle if they concur in our estimate of the situation quoted in paragraph 3 above, may be summarised as follows :  i(i) A t Singapore.By the Admiralty The provision of the necessary seaward defences and storage for them.By the War Office-The provision of the following, together with the necessary storage and accommodation : One battery of three 9-2-inch 35G guns;The conversion of two existing 9-2-inch guns to 350 elevation; Additional 6-inch guns;The required quantity of defence electric lights; Sixteen additional anti-aircraft guns.By the Air Ministry The provision of an additional landing-ground and of the necessary reserve of bombs, torpedoes and other equipment, together with&apos; adequate storage and accommodation, in order that the air units to be sent to Singapore in an emergency may find there the necessary facilities.(ii) A t Hong Kong.By the Admiralty The provision of the necessary seaward defences and storage for them.By the War Office-The conversion of the existing eight 9-2-inch guns to 35D mountings.! The provision of sixteen additional anti-aircraft guns.tBy the Air Ministry The provision of additional landing-grounds, together with the necessary reserves of bombs, equipment and storage facilities, &amp;c.* See paragraph 14 of our Annual Review (C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B).t The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended this step at their 236th Meeting-, and the ^Cabinet approved the conversion in principle in June 1928.I Arrangements are being made for the despatch of six of these guns to lloug- Kong in the autumn -of 1932 : approved scale is 20 A.A. guns.
(iii) At Trincomali.The taking of protective measures on similar lines by the three Service Departments. A detailed report on the defence of Trincomali is now in course of preparation, and in due course further recom-mendations with regard to this port will be submitted.(b) Without prejudice to the question of princijsle now under consideration by the Sub-Committee on Coast Defence, .all preparations should be made for carrying out the above recommendations, including, if necessary, the placing of orders for the armament involved. This latter recommendation, however, is subject to the understanding that, if the Sub-Committee on Coast Defence should not recommend the provision of additional 9-2-inch guns at Singapore, the armament ordered should be used at one of the ports where the provision of 9-2-inch guns has been agreed to.(Signed) G. F. MILNE.F. L. FIELD. J. M. SALMOND.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. March 3, 1932.(Paper No. D.C.O.S.-1.)ENCLOSURE.REPORT BY THE DEPUTIES TO THE CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE  ON THE  SITUATION IN  THE  FAR  EAST.OUR Terms of Reference* from the Chiefs of Staff Committee are as follows : &quot; To meet as early as possible, with a view to preparing a broad apprecia-tion of the situation which would arise in the Far East in the event of Japan suddenly becoming hostile. In preparing this appreciation the Sub-Committee should make such assumptions as they deem most appropriate in existing circumstances as regards possible or probable allies. In particular, the Sub-Committee should, in the light of their appreciation, make specific recommendations as to the measures to be adopted at short notice in respect of the defence of Hong Kong and Singapore in the above emergency. They should not overlook the possibility of assistance from Australia and New Zealand. The Reports of the Joint Planning Committee on Hong Kong and Singapore should be taken into consideration, and the Joint Planning Committee should be utilised if further questions of detail are involved.&quot;2. In submitting this Report we have taken recent events in China not as an isolated episode, but rather as an illustration of what is liable to happen in the Far East at any time during the next few years with little, if any, notice. China is in a situation perhaps more chaotic than at any time since the War. The Central Government is weak, and liable to dissolve when faced with serious emergency. The extent of its control is limited. There is a formidable Communist movement, and the whole country is rent with strife ancl discord. The difficulties between China and Japan are deep-seated, and there is as yet no sign that they are likely to be settled by pacific means in the near future. In these circumstances it seems clear that episodes such as that which is now in progress at Shanghai must be liable to recur, if, indeed, something more serious does not develop.3. From the point of view of Imperial Defence, the most significant feature of the Shanghai affair was the suddenness with which it developed into a first-class international crisis. Without going into the deep-seated reasons for the antagonism between China and Japan, there appears to be general agreement that the main causes of the Shanghai incident were the Japanese action in Manchuria and the resulting boycott of Japanese trade throughout China and elsewhere in the Far East. As distinct from the cause, the actual pretext for the use of force by Japan at Shanghai was the assault on five Japanese subjects, including two priests, by a mob in Chapei, a densely-crowded Chinese suburb adjoining the International Settlement.* O.O.S. 101st Meeting, Minute 3 (0). [6661] G
4.   The suddenness of events is illustrated by the following dates :  January 18. Assault on Japanese by a mob in Chapei.January 19 and 20. A Japanese mob created disturbances in the Inter-national Settlement.January 21. The Japanese Consul-General presented demands, and Japanese&apos;naval reinforcements were sent to Shanghai. The Japanese Admiral announced that drastic measures would be taken if the demands were not complied with.January 27. The Japanese Consul-General, on his own responsibility, delivered to the Mayor of Shanghai a 24-hours&apos; ultimatum, expiring at 6 p.m. on the 28th January.January 28 (p.m.). The Japanese Consul-General informed the Consular Body that an entirely satisfactory reply had been received from the Mayor of Shanghai, and that no action was contemplated. Owing to the attitude of the Japanese naval authorities, the Municipal Council of the International Settlement had already proclaimed a State of Emergency from 4 p.m. Volunteers mobilised, and the various sectors of the defence line were occupied by British, French, American, Japanese, &amp;c. While the Japanese forces were taking up their positions a clash occurred, and the Japanese launched an attack on Chapei.This led to the reinforcement of their forces at Shanghai by all the Powers concerned.February 4. The British Ambassador at Tokio reported that &quot; tension here is so great that a false step might cause the Japanese to take some action which would render war with the Powers almost inevitable &quot; (Tokio telegram No. 63). In a further telegram of the same date, he included the following : &quot; Although I do not wish to be alarmist, I must warn you that Japanese Government are, in my considered opinion, capable of replying to application of Article XVI by reprisals or acts of war against the Powers &quot; (Tokio telegram No. 65).5. It is not too much to say that within little more than a fortnight, measured from the 18th January, or a week measured from the outbreak of hostilities on the 28th January, an international crisis of the first order has arisen. We would observe that the telegrams quoted provide a somewhat striking commentary on the assumption of ten years of peace from any given date, on which our present defensive arrangements are based.6. We realise to the full that the British Government would in no circum-stances themselves resort to war with Japan. The assumption is that indicated in the telegrams quoted, that Japan resorts to war with the Powers, including possibly the United States of America and the members of the League.7. On this hypothesis we will now endeavour to present the situation in its military aspects (using the term &quot;military &quot; in the widest sense) as it would result in the event of a sudden resort to war by Japan. We deal with the question mainly from the point of view of the United Kingdom, but indicate (1), as requested by the Chiefs of Staff, what possibility of assistance there might be from Australia and New Zealand if they decided to co-operate; (2) the importance of obtaining assistance from India; and (3). how the situation would be affected if the United States of America and/or the members of the League were also involved.Existing Situation at Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.Shanghai.8. At the present time the large majority of our forces in the China Command are locked up in the Whangpoo River at Shanghai, whence the only exit can be instantly and without difficulty blocked by the Japanese.9. All our naval forces on the China Station are at the moment locked up in this manner, with the exception of 1 8-inch cruiser, 4 destroyers, 11 submarines and the aircraft carrier &apos;&apos; Hermes&apos;&apos; at Hong Kong, 8 destroyers at Singapore,
and 1 6-inch cruiser at Hankow, where it must remain until the river rises in April. It should be added that the &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Repulse,&quot; which normally belong to the Main Fleet, are at the moment, together with the Second Cruiser Squadron, in the West Indies, some 2,000 miles behind the starting point of the Fleet which would be sent to the Far East.10. An overwhelming Japanese naval force is within easy reach of Shanghai, and, although it is not possible to state how the Japanese Main Fleet is distributed at the moment, the fact, that they have a number of naval bases within a short distance, such as Sasebo, about 390 miles from the mouth of the Yangtse, as well as certain ships at the Saddle Group Islands, exposes the whole of the international naval forces at Shanghai to the risk of a coup-de-main if Japan should ever decide to resort to war. In such an eventuality, the best that cur naval forces now at Shanghai could hope for would be to receive sufficient warning to enable them to withdraw rapidly and disappear into the blue. Judging by the action of the Japanese Fleet at Port Arthur in February 1904, they would be very fortunate if any such warning was received11: Four infantry battalions, together with other details, are also locked up with other foreign contingents in the International Settlement at Shanghai. These, as explained below, have in the past been counted on as part of the normal war garrison for Flong Kong, together with the battalion at Tientsin. If our military forces were removed, the local Chinese authorities would probably lose all control of the Chinese mob and the settlement would be over-run and looted before the Japanese had time to take it over effectively. At the same time the withdrawal of the military garrison by sea in the event of sudden hostilities with Japan might, as explained below, present insuperable difficulties.There are at present no British Air Forces at Shanghai.Hong Kong.12. The Naval Forces now at Hong Kong consist of 1 8-inch cruiser, 4 destroyers, 1 aircraft carrier and 11 submarines.There are at present no local Naval Defences at Hong Kong.13. The Military Forces are two infantry battalions (1 Indian) and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, consisting of two machine-gun companies, one mounted infantry company, one armoured-car company (at present with only-one car which is of unsuitable design) and two platoons of Portuguese.In addition, only 50 per cent, of the War Establishment of artillery and engineer personnel are available for manning the coast defences, which means that all the guns in the fixed defences cannot be manned effectively (including the existing anti-aircraft guns).There is a large reserve of mobile artillery but insufficient personnel to man more than a small proportion of it.14. The existing fixed armament consists of 8 9-2-inch guns with a maximum range of 19,700 yards, 11 6-inch guns with a maximum range of 12,600 yards, 4 4-7-inch guns and 4 3-inch anti-aircraft guns.15. In this connection it should be noted that the ranges of modern naval guns are 8-inch : 29,200 varcls. 16-inch : 38,400 yards.16. In order to place the 6-inch and 9-2-inch coast defence guns on a more equal footing with naval guns, the Committee of Imperial Defence have recommended* (and the Cabinet in June 1928 approved in principle) that the guns at Hong Kong should be remounted on new mountings. This would give maximum ranges of 19,300 and 29,000 yards respectively.17. Mainly owing to the existence of the assumption that no major war will take place for ten years from any given date, nothing has yet been done in connection with the modernisation and resiting of the guns Six additional anti-aircraft guns will be sent out later in the year under arrangements now being; made.* O.i.D. 236th Meeting, Minute 7. [6661] c 2
IS.   The existing stocks of ammunition at Hong Kong consist of All of a type no longer considered suitable against modern armoured men-of-war.The proposed scale of ammunition is as follows :  9-2-inch guns 250 rounds per gun (Equipment ammunition). 200 rounds per gun (War reserve).6-inch gun 500 rounds per gun (Equipment ammunition). 300 rounds per gun (War reserve).Arrangements have already been made to send out extra ammunition. The 6-inch and 4-7-inch ammunition required to bring Hong Kong up to establish -ment is leaving England at once and should arrive within six weeks. The 9-2-inch ammunition is expected to be completed up to the authorised scale by the month of June at the earliest.19.   There are at present no shore-based aircraft at Hong Kong.A proposal was made some time ago for the formation of a new flying-boat squadron to be located at Hong Kong, but in view of financial stringency this has been temporarily abandoned.20. The only established aerodrome at Hong Kong is at Kaitak and is capable of maintaining not more than three squadrons of land planes and two of seaplanes. This aerodrome is exposed to a scale of bombardment from sea and air with which the fixed defences on their present mountings and aircraft now available at Hong Kong would be insufficient to deal. Alternate landing grounds are considered essential to permit operations to be carried on in the face of these forms of attack. It has therefore been recommended [Joint Planning Committee Report Paper No. C.O.S. 233 (J.P.)] that other alighting grounds should be made available. There are only a few areas which could, after prepara-tion, be constituted into alighting areas, and at some of these the preparation required would be extensive and improvement of communications to them would be essential.Singapore.21. Naval Facilities. A floating dock is now moored at Singapore and is available for use. The graving dock has been constructed, but lacks the necessary facilities to make it available for use. Local naval defences are at present non-existent and there is no storage accommodation for mines, &amp;c.750,000 tons of naval oil-fuel are stored at Singapore.22.   Military Garrison and Armament. The existing armament consists of-Medium Armament Blakan Mati, 5 9-2-inch guns 15Q (not altogether suitably mounted).Light Armament Siloso, 2 6-inch guns 15D Silingsing, 2 6-inch guns 15Q. Changi, 2-6-inch guns 15D.Anti-aircraft, 8 guns Defence Electric Lights, 4. Mobile Armament 10 6-inch Howitzers.8 3 - 7-inch Howitzers.6 18 pdr. guns. 40-Machine guns.The situation as regards ammunition for the fixed armament is similar to that Kl Hong Kong (paragraph 18 above) and the light and medium ammunition should be up to the authorised scales in six weeks and four months&apos; time respectively.9 - 2-inch guns : 250 rounds per gun 6-inch guns : 350 rounds per gun&quot;
23.   Garrison normally available for concentration for the defence of Singapore : _ Regular Forces.2 British heavy batteries (personnel only sufficient to man a proportionof the fixed armament and A.A. guns). 1 A.A. battery (8 guns).1 battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade.R.E.-1 fortress company.Infantry 1 British battalion.* 1 Indian battalion.*Local Forces.R.A.-2 batteries, 3-7-inch howitzers.t RE.-1 field company. 1 fortress company.Infantry 1 European battalion (1st battalion, S.S.V.F.).1 Asiatic battalion (2nd battalion, S.S.V.F.).1 European battalion formed from the F.M.S. Volunteer R.iThere are certain other local forces scattered throughout Malaya, but these, in the event of war, would remain in their own districts for local defence.Air Forces.24.   The Air Forces at present stationed at Singapore comprise  One Squadron of Flying Boats (3-5 aircraft).One Squadron of Torpedo Bombers (12 aircraft) with some reserves.About 41 torpedoes and 12 tons of bombs are at present available at Singapore. Further stocks are being despatched and should arrive in about 6 weeks&apos; time.Flying Facilities at Singapore.25. The existing air base at Singapore affords permanent accommodation for one squadron of flying boats and two squadrons of land planes. The base has been so laid out that permanent accommodation can be added later, if approved, for one further flying boat squadron and one squadron of land planes, making the total of permanent accommodation sufficient for two flying boat squadrons and three squadrons of land planes. It is estimated that one more squadron of land planes and two of flying boats could operate in war from temporary accommodation at the same base. This would, however, leave no accommodation ashore for the Fleet Air Arm.&apos;The Relative Importance of Hong Kong and Singapore.26. The question of defending Singapore has by decision of the Cabinet and of the Imperial Conference been set aside until 1935, and, as a consequence, the existing order of precedence for the installation of defences at ports abroad is : Hong Kong, Trincomali, Malta, Gibraltar, &amp;c.27. In the situation now under consideration we consider that without question the order of precedence must be : Singapore, Hong Kong and Trincomali. The situation at the last-named port is described in paragraphs 85 and 86 below.* Normally stationed at Taiping, but would be brought to Singapore in event of war. f One battery normally stationed in the Federated Malay States, but would be brought to Singapore iu the event of war.$ Normally stationed in the Federated Malay States, but would be brought to Singapore in the event of war.
28. The importance of Singapore from the naval point of view has so often been stressed in the last ten years that it is unnecessary to say more than that the base would be absolutely essential if we were to send a large fleet to Eastern waters. Conversely, if Singapore were denied to us, the main battle fleet would have to halt on the way East, leaving India, Australia and New Zealand uncovered, and Hong Kong without hope of early relief.The General Naval Plan.29. The essence of our naval plan would rest on the arrival of our main fleet at Singapore at the earliest possible moment. The Admiralty calculate that, allowing a preliminary period of ten days to get the tankers started on the way, a total of thirty-eight days would be required for the fleet to arrive at Singapore, and another ten days to reach Hong Kong.30. Meanwhile the Naval Forces from Shanghai would endeavour, in the first instance, to disappear into the blue; the fact that they were at large and unlocated might cause the Japanese to delay the sailing of an expeditionary force against either Hong Kong or Singapore. Later, they would endeavour to harass the enemy convoys carrying the Japanese expeditionary forces. With the exception of submarines and certain other vessels, which might be left at Hong Kong with a view to vigorous offensive operations against Japanese forces in the vicinity, the whole of our naval forces at present in the Far East would be based on Singapore prior to the arrival of the main fleet.31. It is clear, therefore, that the security of Singapore is of primary importance in the situation under consideration.Possible Action by the Japanese. 32.   As we have indicated above, it is to be expected that at the outset of hostilities the Japanese would immediately endeavour to deal with our naval and military forces at Shanghai and Tientsin.33. Hong Kong, particularly, in its present almost defenceless condition, must be regarded as a most tempting objective for the Japanese. The possible action which could be taken against Hong Kong by the Japanese has been fully dealt with by the Joint Planning Committee in their Report, Paper No. CCS. 233 (J.P.). The probable antagonism of the Chinese, which was not taken into account in the Joint Planning Committee&apos;s Report, and the deterrent effect of American Naval Forces based at Manila (assuming that America was also at war with Japan), might enable the fortress to hold out somewhat longer than could otherwise be expected. On the other hand, we need only add that the possibility of the capture of Hong Kong before, the arrival of the British fleet would be greatly enhanced by the present detachments from the garrison.34. At the same time, an attempt by the Japanese to capture Singapore before the arrival of the main fleet might well be made in the knowledge of the present comparatively undefended state of the naval base. Singapore must be considered liable to bombardment by ships and sea-borne aircraft at any time after the outbreak of hostilities, and the Joint Planning Committee have calculated (in a Report shortly to be submitted to the Chiefs of Staff), that an attack by one division would be possible in Z i 9 days, or, alternatively, an attack by 10,000 men in Z 4- 8 days. In addition, it is calculated that Japanese reinforcements up to a maximum of two divisions could arrive in Z -1- 23 days.35. The deterrent effect of the American naval forces based on Manila, is a factor which would have to be taken into account by the Japanese in despatching an expedition to attack Singapore, but, in view of the obvious importance of Singapore to our plan of naval operations, the danger of attack will always be great Oar efforts should therefore be mainly directed towards rendering the naval base at Singapore as secure as possible in the short period of warning which may be available.36. In connection with this, we have considered the effect on the situation of the co-operation of other members of the League of Nations with interests in Far Eastern waters, and we have reached the conclusion that, as the Dutch Would not be in a position to co-operate actively in the defence of Singapore with their-
forces in the Dutch East Indies, it would be preferable if Holland remained neutral. This would deny to the Japanese a number of harbours in the islands opposite Singapore, providing that Japan respected Dutch neutrality, bearing in mind that Holland is a member of the League of Nations.Possible Protective Measures at Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.Shanghai.37. It is clear, from previous paragraphs, that there would be no hope of our forces now at Shanghai being able to maintain themselves there. We. suggest that immediately hostilities became imminent all our naval forces now there should be withdrawn without delay and based on Singapore, or possibly Manila, whence they might operate offensively against the Japanese expedition despatched to Singapore.38. We have considered the question of withdrawing whole or part of the military garrison from Shanghai in these ships, but we submit that if the bolt came literally from &quot;the blue,&apos;&apos; no delay could be accepted by the Navy in withdrawing from Shanghai, since any such delay would increase the possibility of an encounter with the Japanese Fleet and would invite a disaster of the first magnitude, not only to our ships, but to any military troops embarked. It may, of course, be assumed that every effort would be. made to remove what would be possible in a hurry if the Government decided to leave the Settlement to its fate39. The regular military forces, together with the Shanghai Volunteers, even assuming that the troops of other Powers were allied to us, could not be expected to hold out against a Japanese attack for any length of time, and. no assistance that the Chinese could afford would be likely to alter the situation.40. The withdrawal of the troops by rail to Canton would also appear to be out of the question. From Shanghai the railway runs N.W. to Nanking, but the present Japanese forces in Shanghai command this railwayThere is no direct railway from Nanking to Hankow; a superior Japanese naval force at Hankow dominates the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. A move by rail via Nanking-Suchcw-Cliengchow-Hankow would be impracticable.Between Hankow and Canton the railway line has never been completed, and there is a gap of 270 miles&apos;midway between both places.41. The withdrawal of the troops from Shanghai cannot, therefore, be counted on, though, on the assumption of the Chinese being friendly, it is just possible that they might be able to withdraw into the interior. The distance to Canton is too great (some 800 miles as the crow flies) and it might be better to endeavour to concentrate the Shanghai and Tientsin garrisons at or near Nanking. The troops could probably exist there better than at any other place in the interior. This might conceivably assist towards organising Chinese resistance which is referred to again in paragraph 96 below.Hong Kong42. The successful defence of Hong Kong, in the circumstances envisaged, for the minimum period of forty-eight days, can be regarded as little more than a forlorn hope, and for this reason we are of opinion that it would be unwise to lock up naval, military, or air reinforcements which might be made available from India or elsewhere, until the defence of Singapore has been assured.43. There are, however, certain unobtrusive measures which could be taken to render the fortress less vulnerable than it is at present, provided they were initiated soon enough.Local Naval Defences..44.   There are at present no local naval defences at Hong Kong.45. We are, however, informed that the following are available at home and could arrive at Hong Kong within about four months : Anti-submarine booms. Contact mines.Controlled mines and guard loops for them. Torpedo nets.
46. In addition, the mine-laying cruiser &apos;* Adventure,&quot; which is now laid up, could be made available in two months&apos; time.47. The provision of these stores for Hong Kong would not, we under-stancl, prejudice the defence of Singapore in any way. On the other hand, in the event of their not being required for immediate use on arrival at Hong Kong, grave difficulties would arise in connection with storage, particularly in regard to the mines, for which no accommodation is available.48. There are at present only four anti-aircraft guns at Hong Kong. Six more are due for despatch in the autumn, but could, if necessary, be despatched earlier (without predictors). The total armament approved is twenty anti-aircraft guns, but no steps have ever been taken to provide them until now.49. We have already referred, in paragraphs 14-17 above, to the out-of-date condition of the coast defence armament at Hong Kong. If immediate steps were taken for the re-siting and re-mounting of a proportion of the medium armament (which has been approved in principle by the Cabinet) this would greatly increase the efficiency of the defences, and we suggest for consideration that this is a measure which should be initiated without delay. In this connection, however, we should mention that a total of twelve 9-2-inch 35Q modern mountings could be made available in this country in twelve months from the date of the placing of the order. These can only be produced in twelve months by working overtime, using civilian firms and the Royal Ordnance Factories, and ignoring all other commitments. The date given is that for delivery at the factory. Additional time will be required-for sending them out and emplacing them, and the guns of a battery would have to be changed gradually to avoid more guns, being out of action at one time than is absolutely necessary. It is difficult to estimate the additional period required for emplacement after the mountings are ready in England. There is, moreover, as yet no agreed scale of defence for Singapore, and no steps have been taken to increase the armament.50. We have already drawn attention to the limited aerodrome accommoda-tion at Hong Kong. The provision of additional alighting areas is also an unobtrusive measure which we suggest should be considered, irrespective of whether an emergency is immediately imminent or not. We understand that, except in the case of the Kwanti Race Course, at least four months might be required to prepare such areas. In connection with the question of aircraft at Hong Kong, it is suggested that it would be of assistance if some of the reconnaissance machines carried by the &quot; Hermes &quot; were left at Hong Kong to co-operate with the submarines.51. In view of the precarious state of the defences at Hong Kong we have considered whether it might not be better in an emergency to cut our losses and remove the small remaining garrison with the moveable armament to Singapore. Apart, from the improbability that we should have sufficient warning for this withdrawal, we think it would be advisable to hold on to Hong Kong as long as possible, both in order to contain some enemy forces and thus possibly to gain time at Singapore, and in the hope that our sea-going submarines might have an opportunity to inflict losses on the attacking forces.Singapore.52. The Joint Planning Committee have at the moment under preparation a Report on the emergency measures which might be taken for the defence of Singapore within (a) one year, and (b) 18 months ;* although this Report is not yet in its final form it has been used1 in preparing the following paragraphs.53. As regards the existing naval, military and air defences at Singapore, it is sufficient to say that these are totally inadequate for meeting a serious attack either by bombardment, air attack or landing, although the defences referred to in paragraphs 22-24 above constitute some deterrent to raids and a reduced scale of bombardment from sea or air.* In accordance with the decision of the Ohiefs of Staff at their 97th Meeting-.
54. In dealing with the emergency measures which could be taken to supplement the existing defences, we have considered them under three headings : (a) Those which could be taken immediately.(b) Those which would require up to 4 months, and(c) Those which we suggest should be undertaken in any case, so as to render the situation less parlous than it is at present.Naval.Measures which could be Undertaken Immediately.55. The only naval measure for improving the situation at Singapore which could be taken immediately on the outbreak of war is the operating from there of all our naval forces in the Far East, apart from submarines which would be left at Hong Kong.56. There are at present no local naval defences at Singapore and none could be counted on in less than 4 months.Measures which would require up to Four Months.57. The following are available at home and could, it is calculated, reach Singapore in 4 months&apos; time.Anti-submarine booms. Contact mines.Controlled mines and guard loops for them. Anti-torpedo nets.58. The mine-laying cruiser &quot;Adventure&quot; (now laid up) could also be made available in two months. It would also be possible to send two small mine-layers (&quot; Medusa &quot; Class) one for Hong Kong and one for Singapore. There are two mine-laying barges which could be made ready by about September next. The provision of the above would not be obtrusive.59. While the above equipment could reach Singapore in 4 months, it should be pointed out that, at present, storage accommodation there is extremely limited, and in the event of the mines, &amp;c, not being required for immediate use on their arrival at Singapore, their disposal would present considerable difficulty unless this gear is kept on board the steamers in which it is sent out. This question is under consideration by the Admiralty. We suggest that it is urgently necessary to place the Local Naval Defences at Singapore on a satisfactory footing, and that immediate steps should be taken to provide the storage accommodation required.Military.Immediate Steps which could be Taken.60. Nothing could be done to improve the fixed defences in a shorter period than several months, and immediately on the outbreak of war the only step which could be taken would be to increase the military mobile garrison. The despatch of any considerable force from home would interfere with our mobi-lisation arrangements, although it might be possible to send one battalion from Malta and one from Egypt. These, however, could not be expected to arrive before the main Fleet and would, therefore, not increase the security of the fortress during the period of greatest vulnerability. A proposal was made some time ago that the Government of India should despatch a division to Singapore in an emergency, provided the situation in India permitted. We recognise that a request for this Division would not be welcomed by India and would almost certainly create very serious political difficulties there. At the same time we suggest that if a really grave emergency arose, ITis Majesty&apos;s Government should be urged to put very great pressure on India to send assistance to Singapore. In the circumstances, it will probably be considered that no approach should be made to the Government of India in the matter until the emergency actually arose, as[6661] d
the response would then perhaps be more favourable than when the request rests on a hypothetical basis.61. It must be realised, however, that a Division from India could not be expected to reach Singapore before the arrival of the Main Fleet (i.e., before 38 days). In fact, it is doubtful whether it would arrive appreciably sooner than a Division from home.Measures which could be taken in Four Months.62. As stated in the Joint Planning Committee&apos;s Report now under preparation, one new 3-gun 9-2-inch battery (Tekong Besar) could be mounted and two of the existing 9-2-inch guns at Blakan Mati could be converted to 35Q mountings within a total period of twelve months. *63. A proportion of the 6 additional 6-inch guns considered necessary by the General Staff could probably also be mounted.64. There are at present only 8 anti-aircraft guns at Singapore, but 16 more were originally approved before work on the defences and on the Base was&apos; stopped. All of these could be supplied well within one year. The additional predictors could in the main only be made available by withdrawal from other units.  A proportion of these could probably be made available within 4 months.65. We suggest that it is urgently necessary to provide without delay adequate anti-aircraft protection for the floating dock and 3 oil-fuel depots.66. There are only 4 defence electric lights at present at Singapore, but there would probably be no difficulty in mounting all the lights required within 4 months. It would, however, not be possible to provide anything more than splinter-proof cover for engine rooms and detachments.67. There should be no difficulty in sending out the 18 additional 18-pdr. guns and 100 machine guns estimated as necessary by the Joint Planning Committee.68. In the event of difficulties arising with India in the matter of sending a Division to Singapore, the following mobile reinforcements could arrive at Singapore from home within about 6 weeks from date of embarkation, providing that mobilisation was permitted : Infantry 3 infantry brigades. 100 machine guns.R.A.-1 mobile heavy battery (6-inch guns).2 field brigades.1 light brigade.2 anti-aircraft batteries.To man 10 6-inch howitzers now at Singapore (approximately 130 all ranks).R.E.-3 field companies.R.A.S.C.-1 lower establishment M.T. company.Auxiliary Troops Signals, Medical Supply and Ordnance. 69.   These reinforcements amount to approximately one Division..70. Units would require to bring no transport except technical vehicles. They could be provided with mechanical transport from civilian sources on arrival at Singapore.71. While the despatch of reinforcements on this scale either from India or from Home to Singapore could naturally not be concealed, we suggest that it might be possible to carry out the movement under the guise of providing protection for our interests in China, as was done in 1927.* On the assumption that no modern 35&quot; mountings would be required for other ports.
Air.Measures which could be taken Immediately.72. The Air Staff calculate that two squadrons of general purpose aircraft could be despatched from India (providing the Government of India agree) at short notice, as well as one squadron from Iraq. All three units would reach Singapore within a fortnight.73. The 2 squadrons in India could be replaced by one from Iraq and one from Egypt if necessary, though this would not be a satisfactory arrangement unless the Middle East Units had been previously increased.74. The reserves of bombs to be maintained at Singapore, which are on their way, will cover initial requirements of these units.Further supplies additional to initial requirements will have to be sent by sea.75. Within a period of about a fortnight, therefore, a total of 1 torpedo bombing squadron, 3 general purpose squadrons and 1 flying boat squadron should be made available at Singapore.Measures which could be taken in Four Months.76. Within a period of 4 months this could be increased to a total of 3 flying boat squadrons, 2 torpedo bombing squadrons and 2 general purpose squadrons, the second Torpedo Bomber Squadron taking the place of one of the General Purpose Squadrons.77. Aeroplane accommodation, as pointed out in paragraph 25 above, is very limited at Singapore, and existing accommodation would not suffice for the land-based aircraft mentioned above and also for the Fleet Air Arm flights if, on the arrival of the Fleet, it became necessary to land some of the Fleet Air Arm, as would happen, for instance, when an Aircraft carrier had to be docked. Additional landing grounds would, in the circumstances envisaged, be urgently required at Singapore. This would take at least one year to complete. The additional landing grounds are necessary, not only from the point of view of accommodation, but also from that of dispersal, in order to facilitate operations.78. We submit that as this is a defence measure which could be carried out unobtrusively and without any protest on the ground of provocation, it should be undertaken without waiting for war with Japan to become imminent.The Possibility of Assistance from Australia and New Zealand.79. On the outbreak of war, the Dominion Naval Forces would come under the command of the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, and all arrangements regarding their disposition have already been made by the Admiralty.80. The military forces in Australia and New Zealand have lately been considerably reduced, and although there has been in existence a plan for providing an Imperial contingent of one brigade from Australia in the event of an Empire war, it is doubtful whether, owing to the recent reductions, any reinforcements could be made available for a considerable time.81. The Air Forces actually in existence in the two Dominions are as follows : Australia: 2 squadrons land planes and 1 squadron seaplanes.New Zealand: Equivalent to 1 landplane flight, with out-of-date aircraft.There would probably be grave difficulty about sending the Dominion Air Forces out of their own country. There would be little, if any, saving of time as compared with sending R.A.F. units via the Middle East and India. Until extra landing grounds are available, the Dominion units, if sent, would occupy aerodrome space, which is very limited, and would be required for R.A.F. units with more up-to-date equipment.[6661j d 2
82. It must also be remembered that in a war with Japan, public opinion, both in Australia and New Zealand, would be likely at the outset to press for an exaggerated amount of local protection.83. We therefore consider that, in all probability, these Dominions could only be regarded, at the best, as a possible source of reinforcement either for Singapore or elsewhere at a later stage.84. At the same time, although this does not perhaps come within our terms of reference, we would invite attention to the improved prospects of our success-fully defending Singapore or Hong Kong if Australia or New Zealand ever agree to provide part of the normal peace garrison for either of these fortresses, as has been tentatively suggested by the Chiefs of Staff in their Report on &quot; Imperial Defence as affecting New Zealand &quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 358-C).Trincomali.85. At the present time some 300,000 tons of oil fuel are stored at Trincomali, which is entirely without defences of any kind.86. In the event of a war with Japan it would be essential to provide at the earliest possible moment, protection against bombardment by enemy cruisers. We have, therefore, instructed the Joint Planning Committee to report, with the least possible delay, what action could be taken for the protection of Trincomali, (i) immediately and (ii) within a period of 4 months.The Effect on the Situation of Co-operation by America, France and China.America.87. Although, as stated above, the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Far East would probably endeavour to withdraw his forces from Shanghai and base them eventually on Singapore, we consider it possible that he might make for Manila, if that base were available to us. Our naval forces, together with the American forces based on that port, could be expected to exercise a considerable deterrent effect on Japanese operations directed against Hong Kong and Singapore. This will depend mainly on whether the Americans have despatched their fleet to Manila in time.88. Manila is extremely strongly fortified with coast defences. It is unknown whether there are any anti-submarine defences, but there is a large number of 14-inch guns and 12-inch modern guns, in addition to 12-inch mortars and many 6-inch guns. The harbour of Manila is, in fact, considered impregnable to direct sea attack.89. On the other hand, the General Staff estimate that at least 3 Divisions would probably be required to hold the island of Luzon, in which Manila is situated, against a landing attack, as it would seem to be a feasible operation for the Japanese to effect a landing in the Lingayen Gulf, about 120 miles to the N.W. and advance overland to Manila. The forces required by the Japanese for this operation need not necessarily be large (see paragraph 91 below).90. There is at Manila a very large harbour, and near by, at Olangapo, there is a floating dock, which it is believed would take 8-inch cruisers, although there is no dock capable of taking a capital ship.91. The American garrison at Manila consists of 4,600 white troops, including air forces (42 aircraft) and coast defence units, and 6,400 Philippino scouts. Of the white troops, one regiment (the only regulars) is now in Shanghai. The nearest American reinforcements are at Hawaii, 4,800 miles from Manila.92. It would appear probable that the Japanese would never attempt operations simultaneously against Manila and Hong Kong, and that the latter, being such a valuable asset, would form the more likely objective.93. Active assistance by America in the local defence of Singapore and Hong Kong during the period under consideration would appear out of the question, except that their submarines might render general assistance if they could be spared.
France.94. An alliance with France in a war with Japan would not be likely to prove of material assistance on the outbreak of war, although this might enable aircraft to fly from Singapore to Hong Kong. We consider, however, as mentioned above, that it would be unwise to lock up aircraft at Flong Kong until the defence of Singapore is absolutely assured.95. Owing to the limited amount of French aircraft maintained in Indo-China, it is unlikely that any air reinforcement could be expected from that country.China.96. On the immediate outbreak of war, it is doubtful whether a friendly China would materially affect the situation either at Shanghai or Hong Kong, but we do not rule out the possibility of organising, by means of British officers, &amp;c, Chinese forces to make trouble for the Japanese at Hong Kong (in the event of their capture of the port), Shanghai, Manchuria, and anywhere else on the mainland where Japanese forces are in occupation.Summary.97. Our more important conclusions may be briefly summarised as follows : (i) Singapore would be of supreme importance in a war with Japan, and in considering emergency measures which are to be taken at our defended ports the order of priority should be Singapore, Hong-Kong and Trincomali.(ii) The naval forces in the Far East would endeavour to leave Shanghai and reach the open sea. They would be based eventually on Singapore, leaving at Hong Kong only submarines and the reduced military garrison at present there, in the hope that, in spite of its weakly defended state, the fortress may possibly hold out for the period of 48 days required for the arrival of the main fleet, or, at any rate, that by containing some part of the Japanese forces, time may be gained at Singapore and an opportunity afforded to our submarines to inflict losses on the enemy.(iii) The military garrisons at Shanghai and Tientsin, which are normallycounted as part of the war garrison of Hong Kong, must be regarded as lost, though conceivably a part of the Shanghai garrison might be withdrawn to the vicinity of Nanking, where it could exist on local resources, on the assumption that the Chinese would be friendly.(iv) The various naval, military and air measures which could be taken immediately, or, alternatively, within about 4 months, are shown in the attached table. Other measures requiring longer periods up to 1 year which have been investigated by the Joint Planning Committee in a Report still in draft form, are also indicated in the table.In particular, we invite attention to the importance of locating without delay the necessary Local Naval Defences at Singapore, Hong Kong and Trincomali, and of providing the necessary storage accommodation. The provision of adequate Anti-aircraft protection for the floating dock and 3 oil fuel depots at Singapore is also a matter for immediate consideration, as is the provision of additional landing ground facilities which are required for dispersal and if it is necessary to land part of the Fleet Air Arm.(v) The equivalent of a Division is considered by the General Staff to be necessary for the security of Singapore, and would have to be obtained either from India or from home. Unless the emergency period was very prolonged, it could not arrive in time. Considerable opposition to the despatch of a division from India is to be expected, and great pressure would have to be brought to bear on the Government of India,
1(5(vi) Little help can be expected from Australia and New Zealand in theearly stages of war, though the possibility of reinforcement from these Dominions at a later date should not be lost sight of.(vii) The participation of America in a war with Japan would provide a naval base which is almost impregnable except to a landing attack at a distance from the fortress, and situated on the flank of any Japanese movement against Singapore, and the Naval Commander-in-Chief might consider it desirable to withdraw the naval forces now at Shanghai to Manila. Otherwise no direct assistance for the defence of Hong Kong and Singapore could be expected from America.(viii) An alliance with France would enable aircraft to be flown from Singapore to Hong Kong, thus avoiding the necessity for transport by sea, but we do not advocate the despatch of any air reinforcements to Hong Kong until the situation at Singapore is secure. Otherwise, in the early stages of the war, little could be expected from the French.(ix) Although a friendly China would possibly increase Japanese difficulties in an attempt to capture Hong Kong by a landing attack, little active assistance is to be expected from China in the early stages of a war. The possibility of organising Chinese forces through the agency of British Officers, &amp;c, at a later stage should, however, be borne in mind.98. In conclusion, we venture to emphasise that our present political difficulties in dealing with the Sino-Japanese problem at the present juncture arise very largely from the insecurity of our naval bases at Hong Kong and Singapore. The ten-year rule and the coast defence controversy are both responsible for this situation, and it would appear to be for consideration whether immediate steps should not be taken to increase the security of both these fortresses and of Trincomali before a crisis actually occurs, in order that the situation may then be less serious than that disclosed in the present Report.(Signed) M.
