NO part of Central Europe has been hit harder by the economic depression than the States which replaced the Austro-IIungarian Monarchy after the War. Two of these, Austria and Hungary, have been more or less in a condition of intermittent bankruptcy ever since, and in spite of financial assistance accorded on several occasions through the intermediary of the League of Nations and otherwise, they are now once again in a state of financial and economic collapse. Hungary has already declared a far-reaching moratorium, and Austria will probably have to follow suit shortly. In both cases the fundamental cause of this chronic disease is the lack of equilibrium in the economic make-up of the new State. Austria is burdened with a capital city and administrative machinery which, called into being to serve a wealthy and exten-sive Empire, are out of all proportion in a small and comparatively poor country. Hungary, after sharing with Austria the control of the old Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, now finds itself reduced to a small agrarian State, without an alter-native source of wealth, without access to the sea, and surrounded by hostile neighbours. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Roumania, though not actually in a state of collapse, are feeling in increasing measure the continued strain of the economic depression. Yugoslavia and Roumania, like Hungary, are agricultural countries, whose staple export industry has been ruined by the fall in world prices of agricultural produce. Czechoslovakia, like Austria, is partly industrial and partly agricultural, and although not perhaps in such a desperate plight as her southern neighbours, is naturally suffering from the virtual bank-ruptcy of most of her neighbours and customers.2. Although the present world-wide depression has precipitated the present crisis in Central Europe, it has long been realised that the economic situation of the various countries of Central Europe was particularly vulnerable. The treaties of peace broke up the economic union represented by the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and led inevitably to the creation of artificial barriers in the form of tariffs, exchange, and communications, which even in normal times wer? bound to impede free intercourse between countries which for generations have been largely interdependent. Under the stress of the present financial crisis to these impediments has been added a series of drastic restrictions on the freedom of trade which have been devised to give artificial protection to the currency of each country. The result has been to produce a condition practically amounting to strangulation. The combination of all these factors has produced a situation of the utmost gravity, which, if left uncontrolled and unremedied, may produce most serious economic and political effects on the whole of the European system.3. It will be recollected that a year ago the Austrian Government tried to find economic salvation by the establishment of a customs union between Austria and Germany. Political considerations made the scheme impossible of realisation, but, while acquiescing in its abandonment, His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciated the necessity of searching for some alternative remedy. With this object in view the Committee of Enquiry into European Union was charged, at the instance of Mr. Henderson, with the task of investigating the various schemes6297   [6728]B
put forward for dealing, not merely with the situation in Austria, but with that in all the Succession States, i.e., the States arising out of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Perhaps these investigations were not directed to a sufficiently definite objective. In any case they did not produce any tangible results, and by the autumn the situation of Central Europe, owing to the development meanwhile of the financial crisis, had seriously deteriorated.4. It has always been the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the real and ultimate remedy for the economic ills of Central Europe is the elimination of the tariff and other barriers which had been set up as the result of the constitution, after the War, of five independent nations in place of one political and economic unit. Unfortunately, however, the growth of vested interests, political jealousies, and nationalistic prejudices during the last ten years has made this objective more and more difficult of attainment. It is clear that only under the pressure of severe economic distress would it be possible to get the countries concerned to make the political and national sacrifices necessary in order to bring about even the mildest form of closer economic co-operation.5. As far back as last December I reviewed the situation and decided that the moment had come when this question of economic co-operation between the Succession States might be raised with some prospect of success. It was decided, moreover, to raise it in the form of a proposal for a customs union. I did so, fully aware of the fact that the obstacles in the way of such a union were numerous, serious, and practically insurmountable. But I preferred to put forward in the first instance what might be described as the full programme, so as to leave no doubt as to the ultimate solution favoured by His Majesty&apos;s Government. A further advantage in proposing a customs union was that by stating at the outset the maximum, we would allow a large margin for subsequent bargaining purposes, in the course of which we should have been able to make our own conditions in return for conceding here and there our most-favoured-nation rights.6. Consequently, the French, Italian and German Governments were informed of our intention to put forward such a proposal at the next meeting of the Committee of Enquiry into European Union. Unfortunately this committee did not meet in January as originally intended, and for other reasons it was found impossible to proceed with the scheme at the time. Meanwhile, the French and Italian Governments had also been enquiring into the matter, and eventually stated their views in the memoranda which have recently been communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government.6a. These memoranda are annexed hereto (annexes A and B). The French memorandum, after, describing the critical situation in the Danubian countries and pointing out that the British suggestion of a customs union would meet with insurmountable obstacles both political and economic, states that in their opinion a solution could best be sought by way of preferential arrangements between these countries. In order to assist in a solution, the French Government declare as follows its willingness to co-ordinate its action with that of other Governments: &quot;It would be happy to be able to concert with the British and Italian Governments to determine in what conditions the attention of the Austrian, Hungarian, Roumanian, Czechoslovak and Yugoslav Governments could be urgently drawn to the necessity for frank and complete exchanges of views between them with a view to making closer their economic relations and ultimately of improving their financial, budgetary and monetary situations.&quot;7. It looked at first as though the French Government were excluding Germany from these negotiations, but this was apparently a mistake. They have now made it clear that they have no such intention, and, in fact, have already approached the German Government in the matter.8. The Italian Government^ reply to this memorandum points out that, whilst they share the view of the French Government as to the desirability of arranging&apos;for a general solution of the economic difficulties of the Danubian States, they are themselves of the opinion that the urgency of the problem brooks no delay, and they have consequently already concluded special arrangements with Austria and Hungary to facilitate exports between Italy and those countries by
way of credits and other facilities, and are inclined to the view that the best method of improving the situation would be by separate agreements between different countries leading to a general agreement. As regards the specific recommendation of the French Government for negotiations between the five Danubian States concerned to study preferential arrangements, the Italian memorandum expresses the opinion that this proposal, no less than the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government for a Danubian customs union, is open at first sight to political and economic difficulties. The Italian Government, therefore, consider that it will be preferable that negotiations for the restoration of the Danubian economic system shall be carried on simultaneously between the representatives on the one band of the five States concerned, and, on the other, of France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy! At the same time, the Italian memorandum declares that the Italian Government consider that prime consideration should be given to the possibility of according urgent and indispensable financial assistance to the Danubian States concerned.9. Meanwhile the Austrian Government had addressed, on the 16th February, an urgent appeal to the British, French, German, and Italian Governments for assistance in surmounting the economic and financial difficulties with which Austria was confronted. This has been followed up by a proposal, by the Austrian Chancellor to the effect that an economic conference for the above purpose should be convoked at Geneva soon after Easter to discuss preferential arrangements in Central Europe.10. At this point it is well to mention certain outstanding political difficulties which must be taken into account in considering this question. They are as follows : (1) Whatever proposal the French Government may make with regard to Central Europe, it is always viewed with suspicion in.both Italy and Germany, who always conclude that France &apos;s ulterior motive is to strengthen her political hold over the Succession States, and more particularly over the Little Entente, to the detriment of both Italian and German interests. Although there is no reason to give this inter-pretation to the eminently reasonable proposals now made by France, we may expect that the German and Italian Governments will view them with suspicion.(2) The Italian Government are always haunted by the fear lest the disjecta membra of the old Austro-Hungarian Monarchy should be recon-. stituted as a political unit. They accordingly view with grave suspicion any attempt even at economic co-operation, lest this should form a first step towards political union.(3) The German and Austrian Governments are particularly nervous lest the latter should be drawn into some economic system from which Germany would be excluded. It is a fundamental dogma of Austrian policy not to close the door to ultimate co-operation, both economic and political, with Germany.(4) The Czechoslovak Government have intimated that the Little Entente (i.e., Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Roumania), must be allowed to consult together before being called&apos; into conference. For this purpose they will require two months before being ready to participate in a conference.11. Such was the position when on my visit to Paris on Saturday I had an opportunity of discussing the matter personally with M. Tardieu. A record of this conversation is annexed hereto.   (Annex C.)The following essential points emerge from my conversation with M. Tardieu : (1) M. Tardieu contemplates a conference between the Danubian States without the participation of the Great Powers, who would merely convoke and &quot; maintain contact &quot; with the conference.(2) M. Tardieu&apos;s proposed invitation to the Danubian States takes as the basis of discussion at the conference, not the idea of a customs union between the Danubian countries,  but the idea of a system of preferential tariffs. [6728] b 2
&apos;4o(3) M. Tardieu&apos;s scheme presupposes that the Great Powers shall in advancedeclare their readiness to welcome favourably such a system. (4) He is most anxious in this matter to act in co-operation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government. (5) He is anxious for internal political reasons to be able to announce at theend of this week, if possible, the scheme which the two governments are prepared to recommend.12. As regards (1), the Composition of the Conference, I am, on further consideration, of opinion that, if there is to be a conference, it ought not to be limited to the five Danubian States. In the light of past experience it seems certain that, left to themselves, these countries will never come to any agreement. There is no political personality, nor any force of public opinion, in any of the Danubian States strong enough to cut through the barbed wire entanglements of vested interests, political jealousies, and nationalistic prejudices which have always prevented, and always will prevent, any approach to even the mildest form of economic co-operation. Pressure by the Great Powers and a lead by His Majesty&apos;s Government as the one disinterested Great Power are, I feel convinced, indispensable factors if the economic problem of Central Europe is to be tackled at all along the line of mutual co-operation. Moreover, the Italian Government and most probably the German Government will want to participate. My original idea, as already stated, was that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take the initiative in raising the question at a meeting of the Committee of Enquiry into European Union. This procedure was tantamount to advocating a conference on the subject between the Danubian States plus the Great Powers. I am inclined, therefore, to urge upon M. Tardieu the advisability of enlarging the composition of the conference, and for this pui-pose I propose to invite him to make use of the machinery already available in the form of the Committee of Enquiry into European Union, on which both the Greater Powers and the Danubian States are represented. The use of this machinery will also solve the question, which would arise in the case of a conference between the Danubian Powers, as to who should preside over such a conference. It would assist the Great Powers to maintain contact throughout the negotiations, while at the same time allowing the Danubian States, by the constitution of appropriate committees, to work out among themselves the details of the proposed economic co-operation. On the question of procedure, however, we must partly be guided by events, and I should like to ask a free hand from the Cabinet to deal with them as they arise.13. As regards (2), Basis of Discussion for the proposed Conference, I am of opinion that matters have developed in such a way that no useful purpose would be served by our asserting at this late hour our original proposal for a customs union. In the interval since it was first broached time has been given to elaborate the difficulties of all kinds which stand in its path, and, although His Majesty&apos;s Government can still maintain that it constitutes, in their view, the ultimate objective, they will, I am satisfied, do well, in view of the concrete proposal now put forward by the French Government, to accept the latter as the basis of discussions.14. As regards (3), Readiness of the Great Poivers to agree to a System of Preferential Tariffs in Central Europe, such a system could only be made effective if those countries, among whom are the United Kingdom and the Dominions, who by treaty enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment are willing to forgo this right so as to enable the contracting States to give each other more favourable treatment inter se than they accord to third parties. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government up till now have maintained that they cannot allow any such derogation from their full rights in the matter of most-favoured-nation treat-ment, I would suggest that on this special occasion the Foreign Office should be authorised to make, if necessary, a definite concession in order that it may not be said that His Majesty&apos;s Government make economic co-operation between the Danubian States impossible in practice while advocating it in theory. Obviously we cannot be expected to commit ourselves in advance to approval of any preference proposals whatever, but, on the Other hand, we need not necessarily refuse in advance to admit the possibility of such proposals being approved. Not only are the economic circumstances exceptional, but the economic position of
the Danubian States is in itself peculiar. His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore, I submit, as an exceptional measure and without prejudice to the fundamental principle, be justified in declaring themselves ready not only to consider favourably, but to facilitate as far as they reasonably can, any scheme of preferential tariffs in Central Europe, even though this involves the abandon-ment in specified cases of most-favoured-nation rights. I would suggest that the Dominions and the Government of India should be urged to make a like concession in so far as they are concerned. But we must reserve, our right to consider the actual scheme proposed, when it is worked out, from the point of view of our own interests.15. As regards (4), Joint Action by the British and French Governments, so long as the principle is maintained that the four great European Powers, including Germany, shall jointly convene the conference, I would suggest that it should be left to my discretion to decide how far it would be advisable, possibly in return for a definite quid fro quo in some other field, to humour French susceptibilites-bilities by agreeing to a statement indicating that the question was originally brought forward as a result of joint action by the British and French Govern-ments. Care, of course, would be taken that such a statement should not alienate Italy and Germany.16. As regards (5), Need for an early Declaration by the Governments, an early declaration is certainly desirable : (a) Because the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Austrian Govern-ment&apos;s two appeals ought not to be further delayed;(b) Because the economic situation of Central Europe is so critical that anearly declaration of policy by the Great Powers is most desirable; and(c) Because His Majesty&apos;s Government, as the only disinterested one of theGreat Powers, ought not, by holding back, to appear to be abandoning to any other Government the lead in this matter.On the other hand, it is equally desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be rushed into taking any premature action which might subsequently be repudiated by the German and Italian Governments. I would deprecate, therefore, any declaration by M. Tardieu on the lines of his proposed draft invitation until after I have had an opportunity to sound the German and Italian Governments.17. Meanwhile, before initiating any further discussions with any of the Great Powers, it is essential that I should be furnished with a ruling by the Cabinet on the two questions of policy which have now arisen. They are as follows : (1) Am I authorised to press for a conference which will include the Great Powers as well as the Danubian States, with discretion to settle the questions of procedure as they arise ?(2) Am I authorised to indicate in advance the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as an exceptional measure and without prejudice to any fundamental principle, not only to consider favourably, but to facilitate as far as they reasonably can, a scheme of preferential tariffs for Central Europe, even though this involves the abandonment in specified cases of their most-favoured-nation rights ?18. There are, of course, further, though subsidiary, questions of policy involved in this complicated problem, and others are bound to arise in the course of negotiations. It may be well, therefore, that, to ensure of their being dealt with as expeditiously as possible, a Cabinet sub-committee should.be set up^to include the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Trade, the. Secretary for the Dominions and myself.Foreign Office, March 14, 1932. J. S.

ANNEX A.French Memorandum.DANS son dernier rapport sur la situation financiere de 1&apos;Autriche et de la Hongrie, le Comite financier de la Societe des Nations a attire 1&apos;attention sur la necessite ou elles se trouvent d&apos;etablir, le plus tot possible, avec certains de leurs voisins des relations economiques plus etroites, et il a marque qu&apos;a la solution de ce probleme est subordonne le retablissement de la confiance des marches financiers dans la capacite de paiement de ces deux pays.L&apos;Autriche et la Hongrie ne sont pas seules atteintes : dans toute 1&apos;Europe danubienne, meme phenomene de resserrement des credits, meme ralentissement des transactions. Tandis que les Etats agricoles, incapables d&apos;ecouler leurs cereales, voient climinuer leur pouvoir d&apos;achat, les Etats industriels se trouvent dans 1&apos;impossibilite d&apos;ecouler leurs productions dans les pays qui sont leurs debouches naturals.La crise mondiale est, pour une part, la cause de cette situation; mais elle n&apos;est pas la seule; il en est d&apos;autres, propres aux pays danubiens, auxquelles il importe de porter remede, sans retard, non plus par des solutions partielles et par des palliatifs qui se sont averes inefficaces, mais par des solutions plus larges. Aussi longtemps que les preteurs auront le sentiment que les causes du mal subsistent, subsistera aussi la crise de confiance signalee par le Comite financier et avec elle le danger aggrave d&apos;un effondrement financier qui aurait sa reper-cussion dans toute 1&apos;Europe centrale.Le Gouvernement frangais estime qu&apos;il est temps d&apos;apporter a la situation des remedes d&apos;ensemble qui, dans rinefficacite constatee des solutions, particulieres, peuvent, seuls, permettre d&apos;assainir la situation.Le Gouvernement frangais a ete heureux de constater, quand il a fait, connaitre les vues ci-dessus exposees, que le Gouvernement britannique avait ete en meme temps que lui conduit a des conclusions analogues, puisqu&apos;il a recemment pose la question de savoir s&apos;il n&apos;y aurait pas lieu d&apos;envisager la formation d&apos;une union douaniere entre les pays dont il s&apos;agit. Le Gouvernement frangais croit que la realisation d&apos;une telle union se heurterait a des obstacles insurmontables, aussi bien dans 1&apos;ordre politique que dans 1&apos;ordre economique, et il lui parait que, sur ce point special, le Gouvernement britannique est aujourd&apos;hui du meme avis. Mais, sur le but, a savoir le resserrement et le developpement des liens, economiques entre les pays danubiens, les deux Cabinets de Paris et de Londres sont manifestement d&apos;accord. Le Gouvernement francais considere, toutefois, que le resultat recherche peut etre obtenu par des combinaisons a base preferentielle sur lesquelles il n&apos;a pas, a 1&apos;heure actuelle, une doctrine arretee, mais dont la necessite lui parait s&apos;imposer.Les echanges de vues approfondis sont necessaires pour determiner les. modalites d&apos;un regime tenant compte des interets divers qu&apos;il s&apos;agit de concilier. C&apos;est aux cinq pays en cause qu&apos;il convient de laisser le soin de proceder a ces. conversations. II va de soi que le regime qui en sortira, pour etre viable, devrait tenir compte aussi, dans toute la mesure du possible, des interets legitimes des Etats tiers. Toutefois, le Gouvernement frangais redouterait que des conditions, ou des limites fussent a 1&apos;avance fixees aux conversations qu&apos;il preconise. Ce n&apos;est que lorsque les cinq Etats en cause se seront entendus qu&apos;il aura lieu de-saisir de leurs conclusions, pour les mises au point definitives et pour tels accords complementaires qui pourront etre necessaires, les organismes competents de la Societe des Nations.La reorganisation economique etant la condition prealable de la restauration financiere, il importe d&apos;aller vite et d&apos;aider les Gouvernements directement interesses a vaincre les resistances d&apos;ordres divers auxquelles ils peuvent se heurter.Le Gouvernement frangais, qui, dans ces questions, a le seul souci de servir 1&apos;interet general europeen, souhaiterait pouvoir coordonner son action avec celle des Gouvernements auxquels la situation de 1&apos;Europe danubienne n&apos;inspire pas moins de preoccupations qu&apos;a lui-meme. II serait done heureux de pouvoir se concerter avec les Gouvernements britannique et italien pour determiner dans.

It is clear to the Italian Government, before everything else, that, while the necessity of adopting measures for the restoration of the economic machinery of the Danubian countries has now become a matter of profound conviction on the part of the European Powers, on the other hand, it has not hitherto been possible to arrive at agreement as to the best means for initiating a general and organic scheme.The attention of the Governments was recently drawn to a proposal made on the 10th January by the British Government for customs co-operation between the countries of Danubian Europe.The French memorandum states the opinion that the British proposal would encounter insurmountable obstacles both in the political and the economic spheres and appears to consider that the British Government now shares this view.3. The Italian Government, as is well known, were among the first to occupy themselves with the economic conditions of certain of the Danubian States which&apos; were most prejudicially affected, and especially with those of Austria from the commencement of the post-war period. They have frequently taken the initiative and have always collaborated willingly in the work of restoration, which, as time went on, has proved to be ever more necessary for these countries. The Italian Government, therefore, fully share the preoccupations manifested by the French Government in their memorandum, and believe that they are justified in maintaining that the said preoccupations are of very particular importance to Italy in view of the special situation in which she is placed as regards the economic fabric of the Danubian States.If Italy is, in fact, actuated in this problem by the same considerations of a general nature and of European interest as inspire the French Government, she -cannot, however, leave out of consideration the particular conditions in which she is placed, by reason of her geographical position, and also by the fact that her economic system forms one entire whole with that of certain of the Danubian States, or the circumstance that her participation in the succession to the former Austro-Hungarian Empire has rendered even more intimate the economic ties which united her beforehand to the State from which the said countries have inherited part of their economic structure.4. The Italian Government, therefore, if they are of opinion that a general solution which would restore the economic position of all the Danube States is indeed highly desirable, are also convinced that, as the greatest peril to-day lies in the difficult situation of Austria and Hungary, a considerable if not decisive step in advance would be accomplished by granting to these two countries suitable financial and economic help.Consequently the Italian Government, while they have always been glad to -consider all the projects which have been advanced, have thought it advisable since May last at Geneva to indicate this point of view of theirs.They have since that date announced the conclusion with Austria and-Hungary of special agreements, the object of which is to facilitate exports by granting credits and other facilities considered proper, having regard to the necessities of the present period of crisis and the particular conditions of trade between Italy, Austria and Hungary.
\The characteristics of the economic systems of the three countries, which constitute a complete unit in many important branches of production, the desire expressed by the Governments of Vienna and Budapest and the willingness of the Italian Government to proceed with this task, even at the cost of immediate sacrihces, have led to the position that at this moment the three Governments, are studying the way to improve these agreements and to amplify and render-more close the economic ties between Italy, Austria and Hungary so as to make an efficacious contribution to the recovery of the economic conditions in the two Danubian States aforesaid. The Italian Government believe that if, as thev hope, these intentions can shortly be put into effect, a first and important step will be marked towards the general recovery of the Danubian States. Their intentions are that this action should in fact constitute an efficacious support to the common labours directed to that end, and that it could be developed in harmony with the French Government&apos;s initiative.The Italian Government have not yet been able to consider whether it may be possible to attain the desired general result by means of a rapid and effective organic plan adapted to the different needs, and taking into account the diverse problems, such as is, indeed, very desirable, but at the same time very difficult, or whether, on the other hand, the only way possible is that of direct understandings and individual assistance, so as to reach the desired solution by means of a number of common efforts.While remaining convinced that, pending the realisation of the first-mentioned method, the second way must be pursued as actively as possible, the Italian Government are naturally willing and desirous of effectively collaborating in the investigation of the various plans formulated for the economic systemisation of the Danube States.6. Under these conditions, the Italian Government are prepared to give their most earnest consideration to the proposals of the French Government contained in the memorandum of the 2nd March, received at Rome on the 5th instant.In substance, the French Government, in view of the difficult economic situation, not only of Austria and Hungary, but of all the Danubian countries,, and of the necessity of not seeking partial solutions or palliatives, propose as a remedy of a general character, calculated to restore finally the economic situation of those States, combinations on a preferential basis between the Danubian. countries.The French memorandum, indeed, acknowledges that, with regard to these combinations on preferential bases, the French Government have not at present any definite doctrine, and considers that the task of arriving at a decision with regard to the means of carrying into effect such a regime, which, moreover, would take into due consideration the interests of third States, should be left to conversations between the five countries concerned.7. The Italian Government find it difficult, in the absence of all the necessary facts, to express at once a final and considered opinion on this proposal, which, moreover, on first examination, does not appear to be free from those difficulties of a political and economic nature which the French Government have discovered in the British proposal.The Italian Government are, on the other hand, somewhat doubtful as to the advisability that the study of combinations on a preferential basis, of which it is not yet possible to determine either the nature or the scope, should be entrusted solely to the five Danubian States, since they feel that such a procedure would retard rather than expedite the solutions which are awaited in the general interest. Nor is it desirable to ignore the vast and complex problems which such a regime as that proposed would raise with regard to third parties. It is. evident that these legitimate interests (which, for their part, the Italian Government consider to be of great importance), might more easily be safeguarded in the course of the negotiations by the Danubian countries than by being brought up at a later date, when the said negotiations have led to solutions which are unacceptable to third States..While, therefore, the Italian Government are very happy to accept the invitation of the French Government to concert with them and with the Governments to which the situation in the Danubian area of Europe causes, similar preoccupations, they are considering whether it would not be appropriate
that the exchange of ideas, of which mention is made in the French memorandum, should rather take place between the representatives of the five Danubian States concerned, on the one hand, and the representatives of France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy on the other, that is to say, with the intervention of those countries which are in the best position to contribute to the economic recovery of the Danubian States.S. In conclusion, the Italian Government, while sharing the opinion of the French Government that the economic restoration of the Danubian countries is the essential basis of their financial re-establishment, consider that it is not possible to fail to take into account the time which will be necessary for the provisions which will be agreed upon and adopted (whatever they may be) to produce their beneficial effects, and to re-establish in the financial markets the necessary confidence in the capacity of those countries to make payments.The Italian Government therefore consider that it is desirable to examine the possibility of granting them urgently the financial aid which is indispensable to prevent possible catastrophes involved in delaying a decision, and is also necessary in order to hasten the difficult work of their economic reconstruction.Rome, March 7, 1932.ANNEX C.Record of Conversation with M. Tardieu.STOPPING in Paris for M. Briand*s funeral on my way from Geneva to-London, I was able to have a long conversation with M. Tardieu on a range of subjects which at present affect our two countries. The interview lasted for nearly two hours.On one subject I wanted to take the opportunity of ascertaining his views and communicating my own more definitely now. This was the subject of the economic problem of the Danubian States. I reminded him that the British Government had put forward confidential enquiries to Paris, Rome and Berlin some weeks ago, and had indicated their own belief that a Customs Union, if it were possible, gave the best promise of good results. Since then we had learned from more than one quarter that this particular method of solution was not likely to be acceptable, but we were still convinced that no time must be lost in finding the best practicable means of improving a dangerous situation. M. Tardieu asked me in what direction my mind was moving. I said I spoke with all reserve, but I was disposed to think, subject to further consultation with my colleagues in England, that a way might be found if the four Great Powers, France, Britain.. Italy and Germany, agreed to urge the five small Powers, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Roumania and Yugoslavia, to meet without delay and consider amongst themselves what plan for closer economic relations they could work out between them, it being clearly understood that the Great Powers, in urging this course,, were not committed in advance to accepting the resulting suggestion, but would have to examine it with due regard to their own interests. Germany, I thought, must be one of the inviting Powers, for it was inconceivable that a satisfactory Danubian arrangement, which must include Austria, could be brought about without Germany&apos;s approval. At this point, M. Tardieu said with considerable warmth that he was delighted to hear me express my own mind in these terms, for he had already prepared a paper, which he intended to give me, and which I should find involved a suggestion on exactly these lines. He then handed me the-document annexed. After studying it, I said that I agreed that it seemed to-follow very closely what I had been hinting at. I noticed, however, that in its present form it proposed to state that the invitation was put forward on the-initiative of the French Government. Would M. Tardieu, in view of his desire to promote close co-operation between France and ourselves, like us to consider whether we should be prepared for the first suggestion to come from the British^ Government no less than from himself. Of course, the invitation to the five small Powers must be from the four Great  Powers altogether, but possibly the-[6728]   / c
Oorigination of the scheme in London and Paris would be the thing that might be stated. M. Tardieu said at once that anything which the French Government wanted to propose they would like to propose along with us, and he hoped the same thing was true of proposals which we wanted to originate. We agreed that there should inany case be no publication of his scheme till I had consulted my colleagues and had communicated with him again. He said that he would like, if possible, for the plan to be announced publicly before the end of. the coming week. Fie would be back in Paris on Friday, and we could keep in touch through our Ambassadors without difficulty.In the course of our discussion, M. Tardieu gave me an interesting account of the order of recent events on this subject. Fie reminded me of our previous discussion at Geneva on the 29th February. Immediately after seeing me he had, as he told me he would, seen Signor Grandi. Signor Grancli had expressed himself as personally favourable to the plan, but said he must consult his chief in Rome. Instead of continuing on this line, however, Italy in the early days of March formally executed the separate arrangements with Austria and Hungary which had been initialled in draft ever since July. And now we had Italy&apos;s claim that she too must be regarded as. a Succession State in this connection, which M. Tardieu regarded as quite inadmissible.Before leaving the Quai d&apos;Orsay, we agreed on the terms of a communique which, for convenience, is also appended to this record.J. S.Paris, March 12, 1932.Pro jet d&apos; Invitation des grandes Puissances aux Etats ddnubieiis.LES Gouvernements soussignes, preoccupes de la situation economique et financiere des pays de l&apos;europe danubienne et egalement desireux de contribuer a, son amelioration prochaine, ont, sur la proposition du Gouvernement francais, precede, avec le seul souci de Finteret general europeen, a un echange de vues sur les mesures qui paraitraient les plus opportunes et les plus efficaces pour atteindre un resultat si souhaitable.Ils out constate a cette occasion que dans sa session de Janvier dernier le Coinite financier de la Societe des Nations a signale tout particulierement 1&quot;importance que presente pour Feconomie danubienne l&apos;etablissement, clans un avenir aiissi proche que possible, de relations commerciales plus etroites entre les divers membres de cette economie et qu&apos;il a nettement marque qu&apos;une solution durable a ce probleme etait indispensable a la restauration de la capacite de paiement de certains de ces pays.En consequence, les Gouvernements allemand, britannique, francais et italien croient devoir attirer Fattention des Gouvernements autrichien, hongrois, roumain, tchecoslovaque et yougoslave sur Fimportance, a leurs yeux capitale, qiFaurait la conclusion entre leurs cinq pays d&apos;une entente economique destinee a elargir le champ de leur activite commerciale.Convaincus qu&apos;une telle entente est une condition necessaire de la restauration economique et financiere de cette partie de l&apos;europe, ils recommandent aux cinq. Gouvernements precites Fouverture entre eux de negociations, quen raison de la gravite de la situation ils suggerent aussi prochaines que possible.Cest, il va sans dire, aux cinq Etats participants qu&apos;il appartient de definir le systeme suivant lequel ils pourraient resserrer les liens economiques qui les unissent.Les Gouvernements precites pensent, toutefois, que ces negociations pourront etre facilities s&apos;ils indiquent des maintenant qu&apos;ils seraient disposes a accueillir favorablement un systeme a base preferentielle, etant entendu que les interets legitimes des Etats tiers seraient sauvegardes dans toute la mesure du possible.Tout en estimant qu?ils nont pas a se joindre aux conversations entre Etats participants, ils pensent egalement qu&apos;il est souhaitable, pour la realisation de Fentente envisagee, qu&apos;ils demeurent en contact avec ces Etats; ils estiment necessaire qu&apos;a cet effet ils soient tenus regulierement au cc \ *t du developpe-ment des neoociations. &apos;
Cette liaison faciliterait la mise au point definitive de F entente, ainsi que la conclusion ou Fenterinement des accords complementaires que celle-ci pourrait appeler et qui pourraient faire Fob jet de conversations ulterieures entre les Etats membres de Fentente et les Etats particulierement interesses.T elephoned to London at 3-15 p.m., March 12, 1932.TELE President du Conseil received Sir John Simon, the Foreign Minister of Great Britain, this morning from 10 o&apos;clock to midday.2. Sir John Simon, who wished to come to Paris to-day to be present in person at M Briand&apos;s funeral, repeated to M. Andre Tardieu the expression of the deep emotion caused to the Government and people of the British Empire by the death of the eminent statesman.  M. Andre Tardieu thanked him deeply.3. The two Ministers, who had not had an opportunity of meeting since the 29th February, talked of what has happened at Geneva since then.4. They expressed satisfaction at the happy conclusion of the League of Nations&apos; labours by the unanimous voting of the final resolution, and they further reviewed the questions which the Disarmament Conference will discuss next week.5. Sir John Simon and M. Andre Tardieu then considered the various problems with which their respective Governments are at present faced.6. In particular they examined the economic situation of Central and Danubian Europe.7. They found themselves in agreement that, in this, as in all other matters, co-operation between France and Great Britain should extend over a wide field, with the two-fold object of appeasing political rivalries and expediting economic reconstruction in Europe.
