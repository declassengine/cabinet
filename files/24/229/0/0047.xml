[This document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1932.SECRET.CP. 147 (32). Copy No......%.CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments in India.S. H.India Office, 3rd May 1932.Government of India.1. The attempt to hold the Congress session at Delhi passed off without trouble, but a number of preventive arrests had to be made. The attempt was a fiasco. There were no reactions in other Provinces and the situation in Delhi quickly returned to normal.2. The principal feature of the week has been attempts in various places tO&apos; destroy letters in post-boxes.3. News has just been received of the assassination of Mr. Douglas, District Magistrate, Midnapur.Delhi.The attempted Congress session of 24th April proved a complete failure, since the prohibition order was enforced, arrests were made, law and order was maintained, and no serious clash resulted from which Congress could make capital. The result is that conditions, which at one time appeared grave, have speedily returned to normal. Section 3 arrests 8. Six persons have been arrested for disobedience of orders under section 4.Bombay.The attempt to hold the Congress session at Delhi aroused no appreciable interest in the districts. One attack on forests was reported from Kanara on 20th April. In Bombay city partial hartals were observed on 23rd and 25th as a protest against arrests of Mrs. Naidu and Pandit Malaviya. A meeting of 1,000 persons at Chowpatty on the 25th April was dispersed by the police. On the same day letters in one post-box were found damaged by fire. Picketing is being continued on a reduced scale. Chemists&apos; and druggists&apos; shops have remained open throughout the week. In consequence of an attempt by Congress to fine two bullion merchants, police assistance was asked for and given, and the picketers were subsequently arrested in the Bullion Exchange. The Press printing boycott supplement of the Congress bulletin has been raided and seized. Ordinance 2. Section 3 : arrests, 34; total under detention, 68. Section 4 : orders, 39; total in force, 859. Section 21: convictions during week, 13.Bengal.There has been no important change in the situation, except for nine cases of fire in letter-boxes in Calcutta during Post Office boycott week. There has been similar activity in Contai. The Delhi Congress session caused little local disturbance. Section 3 : arrests, 36, nearly all preventive in connection with Delhi Congress session. Section 4 : orders issued, 61; approximate number in force, 714. For the Province, outside Calcutta, full figures are not available.   Convictions, 140.891      60  4.32
Madras.The general situation remains much the same, but civil disobedience activity shows-a general tendency to decrease, and there is a fall in the number of convictions in most districts.   &quot;Postal week&quot; was marked by five instances of incendiarism in Madras city, but with little real damage to letters.Punjab.The Province generally is quiet. Neither Sikhs nor Ahrars have given Congress effectual assistance, but the situation both in Amritsar and Sialkot is still fluid. There were three instances of incendiarism of pillar-boxes : two in Lahore and one in Gujran-wala. There has been one arrest in this connection. The Lawrence statue, Lahore, was attacked by four Sikh Congress volunteers, who were, however, arrested before substantial damage had been effected.

Section 4, orders during the week, 48 ; total orders in force, 983.United Provinces.The lull in activity continues. Postal week was signalised by attempts to destroy articles in post-boxes in five districts. Two bombs of a crude type exploded in Hardoi without causing damage.

No convictions for disobedience of such orders have been made.   Total convictions up to 23rd April, 5,987.Assam.The arrest of Syed Hussain Ahmad at Delhi caused some unrest among the-Muhammadans in Sylhet town, and a report is current that some may join the Congress movement.
