n n r*THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRET CABINET. Copy No.       9_uT%TT35(52)Prolongation of Unemployed in Pensions Insurance. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.As the result of further discussion on the lines indicated in Cabinet minute 21(52), I wish to make the following further proposal to meet the views expressed as to the desirability of doing everything possible to maintain the unemployed in insurance for pensions.I may with advantage take the opportunity of re-stating the matter in the way in which I think it should be presented in order to recommend it to public opinion.This question is only one aspect of the wider question of unemployment. -At the present time it is not possible to foresee -with certainty what the future of employment in the country is to be.     We cannot foresee the effect of a new state of affairs in respect of currency, or of a new policy in respect of tariffs.The general financial stability of the national scheme of contributory health insurance must be secured against im-pending disaster.      That will be done by the proposals which have been approved in respect of arrears and women&quot;s benefits. But When that has been accomplished,  and indeed as a consequence of its accomplishment,  it is possible without undue danger to the finance of the scheme, and its contributory basis, to main-tain for a period in favour of the unemployed their medical benefit, and for a further and longer period their valued pension rights.
A further reason for doing so is that we have yet to solve the kindred problem of unemployment insurance.     A solution of it has to be found in the light of the report of the Royal Commission.     After the solution has been decided upon in principle, it has to be applied in practice.     The ancillary problem of the pensions rights of the unemployed may not imprudently be left for final solution until a time when we shall have the help of experience of the solution of the main problem.To that experience should be added the experience of the working of the Pensions scheme which will be available in 1935, in which year, pursuant   to the terms of the Act of 1925, the Government Actuary is required to report to Parliament on the general financial operation of the Act and the amount of contributions from the Exchequer which will be required to preserve the solvency of the scheme.These considerations point to the following conclusions.A special period should be established in respect of the pension rights of the unemployed, long enough to enable us to act with better knowledge of the permanent state of employment, and of the solution of the problem of unemployment insurance, but not beyond the date when Parliament may desire to review the whole scheme in the light of the Report of the Government Actuary.During this period the rights of the unemployed in respect of pensions should be stabilised, without prejudice to a final settlement.     I propose that this speoial period of stabilisation of pension rights should be a period of three years from the end of the present year.     The three years would be made up as follows.     One year (1933) v/ith free medical benefit and pension rights,  followed by one year (1934) with free pension rights, both part of my original proposal;    and a further year (1935) with free pension rights, which I now propose to add. In the case of re-entry to employment at any time in the two latter
9 9 9years the qualifying conditions for Health Insurance benefits to be the lapse of 26 weeks, and the payment of 26 contx&quot;ibutions after re-entry, instead of 104 weeks, and the payment of 104 contributions as at present.The Bill would provide that at the end of these three years the situation would revert to the position as originally proposed by me under which the unemployed receive a maximum of 3-2. years free insurance for pensions,  and 2&amp; free health insurance. The contributory basis would thus be maintained at least in form and as a goal.     But it would be the avowed purpose of the plan to provide time for consideration and to prevent loss of pensions to the unemployed unless and until we know it to be inevitable.I believe that this proposal will be both sounder and more acceptable than any concession in the nature of easier voluntary insurance.      I have gone very fully into the possibilities in that direction, but apart altogether from the real risk of creating a sense of grievance in the minds of the existing 450,000 voluntary contributors who are at present paying the full contributions, I find it   impossible to devise any practicable and adequate plan.On the practical side, whatever can be proposed must be met by the obvious retort &quot;What is the use of offering to let people pay voluntarily for their own insurance, on whatever terms, when ex hypothesi they are out of work and have nothing to pay with?&quot;On the financial side, once a scheme is voluntary, there comes in the powerful adverse force of selection against the scheme.     For this reason in particular, and others stated in the memorandum of the Government Actuary In.H.I.(32)3] it is impossible to reduce the contributions to be reqiiired for voluntary insurance to any figure that would give reality to the concession.I am authorised by the Secretary of State for Scotland to state that he concurs in this memorandum.(Intld.) E.H.Y.April 15th,  1932.
