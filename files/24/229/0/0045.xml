0 90W hj *Jdocument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government..,T.45(32)CopyOfG A B I IT E T .Sunday Performances  (Regulation) Bill, 1932Memorandum hy the Home Secretary.I circulate,  for the consideration of the Cabinet,  the attached memorandum prepared by Mr. Oliver Stanley,  explaining the present situation with regard to this Bill.H.S28th April, 1932.
SUND/Y FERFORM/NCES  (REGUL/TION) BILL,  1932, Memorandum by Mr. Stanley.The narrow majority by which the Sunday Performances Bill got a Second Reading made it apparent that its passage through Committee in the limited time available this Session would be a matter of great difficulty,  if not/impossibility.    Conversation with prominent supporters and opponents of the Pill led me to believe that a compromise on the following lines would find acceptance with the great majority of Members.(1)    Exhibitions of Animate and Inanimate Objects   (zoos and museums) and debates to be exempted from the operation of the Sunday Observance Act, 1780. (2)    Power to license Sunday concerts to be given to the same authorities, which have power to license musical entertainments on week-days, with the additional power to attach conditions as to the suitability of the entertainment. (3)    Power to license Sunday cinemas to be confined to those  areas to which the temporary Act applies,  I .e . those areas where any cinema was opened in pursuance of a purported arrangement with the licensing authority during the twelve months preceding October 7th, 1931. Conditions would be imposed to secure the six-day working week for employees and the payment of some part of the profits to charity . (4)    Power for those authorities who are net included under  (3) to apply to the ..House&apos; of Commons for legislati.ve--sahc.tion through a less cumbersome and less &quot;^qo-striy procedure than the ordinary Private Bill prc-oedure, which is of course open to thevn-.A meeting of the- opponents of the &apos;BJL1I was, I understand, on the ft no le in favour&apos;,&apos; of thls--compromise,  though expressing
some hostility to  (4), and appointed a negotiating committee to meet the supporters of the Bill, hut subsequently a not very well attended meeting of the supporters by a majority of approximately 30 to 20 passed a resolution which in effect bars the way to  any possible compromise and insists on the passage of the Bill.i difficult situation has therefore arisen, in which it appears to me the following courses are open.(1)    To continue with the Bill in Committee in the hope that it will be possible to get it through before the end of the Session.    On the voting; strength of the Second Reading the supporters of the Bill will only have a nominal majority of 2 or 4 in the Committee, and it seems clear that with this majority it will be quite impossible to defeat the determined obstruction which is threatened. (2)    If the Bill fails to make progress -(a) to do nothing and allow Sunday cinemas to be closed when the temporary Act expires in October.    This would create an intolerable situation especially in London and is not really desired even by the majority of the opponents of the Bill. (1p) to renew the temporary Act for  another period of a year.    This  apparently was the course favoured by the majority at the meeting of the supporters of the Bill. Even if this were practicable, the only effect would be to postpone the controversy for twelve months with no prospects that any different result will then be obtained.    Indeed the opposition is likely to be strengthened rather than weakened as an inevitable election draws nearer.    In any case it would not be possible, as is generally assumed, to use the Expiring Laws Continuance Act for this purpose.
ti Ui 0In the first place,  as the Sundry Performances  (Temper ary Regulstion) Act, 1931 expires early in October, it would be necessary to take the annual debate on Expiring Laws Continuance Bill before the House rises in July, instead of December, as has always been the custom.    In the second place, the temporary Act requires amendment in order to make clear that the Local Authority has power to impose conditions as to profit, as there is some doubt whether under the Act as at present drafted the Courts would enforce such a condition.    Of course no amendment is possible of an Act included among the expiring laws to be renewed .(3) To introduce as a. Government measure a Bill embodying the suggested compromise terms, as soon  as it became apparent that the present Bill.can make no progress in Committee. I have every reason to believe that such a course of action would commend itself to the majority of supporters and opponents alike who do not wish to see a crisis arising in October and would be glad if the Government took over the responsibility.    Such a measure would have to be backed by the full weight of the Government and of the Whip.Such a Bill will be open to many objections, and will undoubtedly reate undesirable anomalies, but unless the Government is prepared ither to repeal the Sunday Observance Act, 1780, or to let Sunday inertias close,  there seems no way of reaching a logical solution,  and his course will at least avoid for the present a perennial recurrencethe question which will distract the attention of the House from siore urgent matters without advancing to a solution.    If the Governmentcided to introduce such a Bill,  the question would arise whether (4)  (new procedure for local authorities&apos;   application to Parliament) hould be included or not.       On merits it certainly should be, but
it will undoubtedly cause some offence to the opponents, although I doubt whether it would be sufficiently strong seriously to endanger its passage .0.P.G.S .27th April,  1932.
