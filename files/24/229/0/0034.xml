nOGUMEWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate a memorandum by the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, covering a report which has been made to him by the Export Credits Guarantee Departmentfs Advisory Committee.   It has not been possible to hold a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Trade with Russia, but if orders which the Russians now seem ready to place are not to be lost, a very early dooision on the Advisory Committee&apos;s recommendations must be taken.I therefore ask for authority to request the Advisory Committee to prooeed on the lines whioh they have suggested.The question of denouncing the   Temporary Commercial Agreement with Russia will be referred to the Cabinet Committee as soon as the investigations now being undertaken by the departments concerned have been completed.BOARD OF TRADE,16th April, 1932T. PLEASE RETURN TO PRIVATE SEQRETAR^OPY NO.     9134 .(52 )0 A D I N E T. TRADE WITH RUSSIA.
oTRADE &quot;WITH RUSSIA. Memorandum by the Secretary for Overseas Trado.I attach a memorandum by the Export Credits Guarantee Department on the negotiations which have been undertaken by the Advisory Committee in accordance with the request of the Cabinet.(2) It will be seen that the prospect of a satisfactory arrangement for granting credits up to 2 years against some security is not favourable in the near future.      The Advisory Committee would therefore prefor to shorten the period of credit and limit the total amount to a moderate figure, as a temporary arrangement until the general conditions of Anglo-Russian trade have been satisfactorily defined.     Their proposals would secure a certain amount of business during the next six months by increasing the existing credits by a further sum of  2,400,000 of which the Governments share would be some  1,800,000.     None of this would be at more than 18 months and most of it should be at 12 months or less.(3) The Advisory Committee do not anticipate the placing of substantial orders by the Russians on the basis of 12 months credit only.      In this view they are no doubt influenced by the fact that Russia&apos;s existing commitments limit severely the amount of orders which she can place unless payment is deferred until such time as these outstanding obligations have been met.(4) To&quot;the extent to which the Committee&apos;s views are adopted, the-Cabinet by sanctioning a small additional risk will reduce the adverse balance of trade.     The alternative is to let existing iiabiiities run off and refuse further credits at the cost of losing business.      This would worsen the trade balance for a time as exports would fall off though imports will probably continue at a substantial rate.(5) The latter alternative raises the question whether, if
the balance of trade cannot to some extent be redressed by the grant of noderate credits, we should not resort to the alternative remedy of restricting imports from Russia, which can only be done after termination of the present Commercial Agreement.     The effects of such restriction and related questions are now being considered by the Departments concerned and a report will be submitted as soon as possible to the Cabinet Committee on Trade with Russia.(6) The credit question is however urgent, since whatever decision may be reached as to termination of the agreement our attitude regarding Trade for the next six months must be defined. I recommend that, as an interim arrangement, the proposal of the Export Credits Guarantee Committee be approved forthwith.      The Committee have reason to think that the Russian Government have been brought down to the shortest terms of credit that their present financial situation permits them to accept, and these terms are definitely shorter than Germany is now granting.    Orders of some importance are apparently available, but are likely to go to Germany unless accepted here in the next few days.      I recommend therefore that the Export Credits Guarantee Committee be authorised to proceed with a limited amount of eredit business as set out in paragraphs 9 and 10 of their attached memorandum.(7) I should like to take the opportunity of adding that there are certain goods and services which are generally paid for in cash or on short credit, to which the attention of the Russians should be directed, and would urge that the Foreign Secretary should forcibly remind the Soviet Ambassador of the possibility which the Russians have of improving the balance of trade by an increased use of British shipping and by larger purchases of British herrings.J.C.10th April, 1932.
Memorandum &quot;by the Export Credits Guarantee DepartmentonIf rCredit Negotiations.At their last meeting on the 1st February, 1932, the Cabinet Committee agreed that the Export Credits Guarantee Department should be asked to sound the Russian Trade Delegation on the possibility of obtaining security for further guarantees covering credits in excess of 12 months and to report before the next meeting of the Committee.(2) Discussions have consequently been undertaken with the Soviet Trade Representative In London by the Committee and Manager of the Export Credits Guarantee Department with the following result:(3) The Soviet Representatives have, after several meetings, now produced a proposal.    They ask for roughly  12,000,000 of- credit, of which about 2,000,000 would be at 12 months:  5,000,000/6,000,000    &quot; &quot;    &quot;  18 months: 5,000,000/5,000,000    &quot; &quot;    &quot; 24 months.These periods are to count from-shipment of the goods and therefore on the longest credit the bills might not fall due until  three years from the placing of the order as compared with a previous maximum of 2% years.The Russians do not propose any credits shorter than 12 months as they state they are not buying the consumable commodities to which such short credits are appropriate.As to security they state that as part of  this proposal they are willing in principle to provide some security and offer 5&apos;f. of the amount of the credits in the form of platinum or other approved goods.      It appears that platinum is not very saleable at the present time and apparently also the Russian Government press for an immediate
decision to grant credits and would leave the disoussion as to the deposit of security until later.(4) 7/hilst the Export Credits Guarantee Committee note with satisfaction that the Russians admit the principle of providing some security, they do not consider that the above proposal can be regarded seriously and they would propose therefore,  if the Cabinet approved, to inform the Russian Representatives that their proposal is unacceptable.    At the same time they consider that the door should be kept open for further credit negotiations and as they,   believe that Russia would find difficulty in providing much security in the near future, they have considered other conditions on which a moderate amount of fresh credit might be given pending a final decision by H.J4. Government as to their policy in regard to trade with Russia, which may not be attainable until after the Ottawa Conference.(5) The difficulty of recommending an immediate course of action is increased by developments betY/een Russia and Germany.    During the Easter recess it was announced in the German press that Russia had placed orders in Germany for over Jf30,000,000 RMks. of iron and steel products on credits of 21 months.    It now appears that only one-third of these orders has yet been accepted and that the balance will be executed subject to the possibility of financing them.    The Embassy in Berlin further states that it Is anticipated in Germany that Russia will place orders in that country during the current year for some 300,000,000 RMks.    Up to the present time the German Government is said not to have given guarantees for any new Russian orders.    The position is at present obscure, but in the present state of German finances it is difficult to believe that any important amount of credit will be granted to Russia by German industrial firms without the aid of the German Government.
(6)    Further information in regard to the German Governments attitude will,  it is hoped, be forthcoming in the near future.      Although the German Government has so far not been willing to enter into a general agreement with ourselves in regard to the terms of credit for Russia,  close relations with the German officials wer^ established last summer and are still maintained.      These German officials have just now asked for a further discussion with us about the terms of future oredits for Russia and after those discussions have taken place it may perhaps be easier to understand the position.        In any case, however,  the probabilities are that German competition will continue to make the task of obtaining Russian orders on shorter credit difficult.(7)    It is learned also that the Italian Government are in negotiation with the Soviet Representatives. H.M. Ambassador at Rome reports that &quot;there is a remarkable absenoe of prejudice against doing business with the   Bolsheviks&quot; and that &quot;the desire to extend trade is apparent&quot;.      The difficulty is that of credits.    It is not clear whether the object of the negotiations is to secure an inorease of Russian orders on the somewhat liberal terms of credit laid down in the Italo-Soviet Trade Agreement (which was not denounced in January and must therefore run on until April 1953)    or to secure by agreement a reduction of the stipulated credits.    In any case it is clear that Italy is perturbed by the unfavourable balance of her trade with Russia and is reluctant to redress it by giving longer credit.(8)    These facts have rendered the task of the Export Credits Guarantee Committee extremely difficult.    They have reason to think, however, as a result of their negotiations that in respect of orders for which Russia has hitherto
been asking for 24 months&apos;  credit maximum,  certain substantial orders could be arranged on terms of 18 months or less though it is doubtful whether in these circumstances security would be obtained.    The Committee consider that if a choice is necessary,  the shorter credit without security is preferable to the longer credit with the rather vague and doubtful security so far mentioned.(9) In these circumstances the Committee make the following proposals:They observe that whatever aotion Government may decide- to take about trade with Russia in general,  there will be a period of six months before any change can take effect.      They have therefore confined themselves to considering this period.      Whilst rejecting the recent Russian proposal they would be prepared to guarantee a certain amount of Russian bills payable in respect of orders to be placed before the end of September.      Having in mind the orders which they think could be placed and the fact that Russian bills for  1,600,000 fall due during the next 6 months, they would propose during the next 6 months to give guarantees in connection with bills for not more than  4,000,000(the guarantee being for not more that 75 ) .      They consider that none of these bills should be of a tenor of more than 18 months;    that a considerable proportion should be at 12 months or if possible less,  and it is their intention (so far as possible)  to limit the amount of new bills at more than 12 months to the amount -( 1,600,000 - of bills falling due before the end of September.    On this basis they hepe that the Russian commitments at more than 12 months would only replace commitments already in hand. The only increase in liability
on Russian bills- would be in respect of bills at 12  OiFths- 6tt less which the Committee arc in any case prepared, and authorised by the Cabinet to consider.     It should be added that the figures mentioned are the face value of the bills. The Department&apos;s liability in no case exceeds 76% of this figure so that the contemplated increase of Government liability is not more than  1,800,000.(10) The Committee make these proposals as a temporary expedient, believing that it is desirable to continue some exports to Russia but not wishing to make any large increase in the credits of more than 12 months at the present time. They consider that Russia is unlikely to buy any large amount of goods at 12 months&apos; credit especially if that remains the maximum for all classes of goods and recommend the above scheme as the best available compromise.     They would try to get as good security as possible, but the prospect of obtaining any considerable amount of security in the near future is not good and, if the Cabinet agree, they would not, for this temporary  proposal, make it an indispensable condition provided that the instalments up to a maximum of 18 months are spread to their satisfaction.      In any event there is a strong tendency in the Committee to make the Russian Government pay a good price for these credits by a premium which remains the property of H.M. Government rather than accept a security which can only be moderate in amount and would have to be returned to the Soviet Government as the bills were paid.      They attach great importance to the building up of adequate reserves against the risk of default by Russia and trust that, as in the past, it may be left to their discretion to fix such rates as circumstances may, in their opinion, render appropriate.
