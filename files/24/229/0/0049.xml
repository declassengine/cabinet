TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.TOST SECRET -3. P.  149(58) .0 A B I fff B T.THE IMPORT DUTI5S ACT (1952).PROCEDURE ON REPORTS OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE.JOPY NO.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I invite the attention of my colleagues once more- t*. the decision we took on-the 18th&apos;April in approving the Import Duties proposed by the Advisory Committee set up under the Import Duties Act (1932).I am not questioning our decision in any way, and I am satisfied that it was in accordance with our intentions when the May Committee was set up; &quot;but tho point whiwh I want my colleagues to consider Is whether we can continue, as time goes on. to work on the same lines.Under this procedure wo have handed over to a Committee the virtual control of matters of policy on which the future prosperity of the country depends.    In actual practice we leave that Committee entirely unfettered, and as a Government we put the-.whole weight of our authority behind the Committee&apos;s recommendations and ask Parliament to endorse them without even having reyiewed them in detail our s el ve Si
0 0 O -Jo 0Vg are all familiar with the complications Involved in the questions with which the Advisory Committee has had to dealo    Seme of us have sat for months as members of Inquiries by the former Committee of Civil Research and the present IDconomio Advisory Council,  to examine such questions as the position of the Steel Trade or the Textile Trades and. we have had to take decisions on elaborate Reports of Committees set up under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure.    &apos;*e know perfectly well, therefore, that the May Committee has not had time to examine exhaustively the effects of the Duties which it recommends, or their reactions on other industries and on inter-national relations.    I myself was astonished, on April 1.8th,  at the length of the Schedule of Import Duties which we were asked to approve.    In the time at the Committee&apos;s disposal the greater part of the items included therein can only have received scant attention.    I had anticipated a much more gradual process, under which the Committee would begin with one or two of the &quot;key&quot; industries, like Iron and Steel.,  and Textiles,  and submit at one time a relatively small block of recommendations after exhaustive enquiryo    Following one another in succession, these blocks of Duties, within the period of a year or two, would have achieved the objects we desire,  on a reasoned basiso Knowing the difficulties of the questions involved,  it was not without some misgivings that I gavo my assent to the adoption of the Schedule recommended,&apos;I therefore ask my colleagues to turn over in their
&amp; &amp; &amp;minds whether they are satisfied to continue to deal with this great question of policy on the same lines in the future, and whether they have any suggestions to make as to the future9(Signed)    JoIUM.1C , Downing Street, S^l.- , May 4th, 1933.i
