[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1932.)SECRET.CP. 126 (32). Copy No........M.CABINET.DISARMAMENT. Suggested Prohibition of Air-bombing. Views of the Government of India.MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR INDIA.In view of the impending discussion of this subject I circulate for the information of my colleagues a telegram which I have just received from the Government of India. These are the views of the Government of India. My own views will be stated in the Cabinet.S. H.9th April 1932;Telegram from Government of India, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 1th April 1932, No. 924.The problem of defence on the North-West Frontier is unique and has no exact parallel in the world. It has a double aspect. - The first is defence against external aggression from over the frontier, which constitutes international war, and the second control iu normal times of peace of armed tribes living between the frontier and. the administrative border. This latter may assume character of war, though not international war, at any time.2. In so far as international war is concerned our plans are based on bringing war to an early conclusion by the advance of land forces to limited objectives combined with aeriaL action against targets of military importance largely centred in and. around Kabul. The elimination or restriction of the latter would delay a decision, and might compel us to invoke assistance from home even in lesser contingency of war with the independent tribes.3. For controlling tribes, it is important to stress the great difference between the control of unarmed individuals in administered territory and of armed tribes in inaccessible and unadministered terrain. This means that though nominally at peace with the tribes as a whole, hostile lashkars from disaffected sections may at any-time, and not infrequently do, assemble and move towards our administrative border with hostile intent. Unless these are discouraged and dispersed in the first stages while still beyond reach of our land forces, such hostile bodies attract in their course others, and may assume formidable proportions by the time they reach the border. In air forces, we possess a powerful weapon for such purposes, as has once again been recently exemplified in Bajaur and Mohmand territory.4. If this method of attack, which has now been iii operation for some years, were-to be discontinued, the tribes are bound to become more aggressive. Our experience of 1930 proves that tribal unrest was a considerable source of impetus to the civil disobedience movement, and that menace of tribal aggression produces reactions not only in the North-West Frontier Provinces, but throughout India when internal conditions are disturbed. Tho recent unrest in Bajaur and Dir was at once followed by a recrudescence of Red Shirt activities in part of the Peshawar district. By means of aerial action, we are able to nip in the bud incipient trans-border movements and thus afford relief at critical times to the general political situation.5. Method employed is to attack villages from which hostile lashkars have come, as this has been found more effective in its preventive action that attaching actual lashkar itself, firstly, because they do not go about in large bodies, except; by night, 828      60   4.32
and secondly, because oi: the difficulties of seeing whether a small body is hostile or not. Aerial attack on a village is invariably preceded by the issue of warnings specifying the object which will be attacked and the precise time at which attack will begin. Period of notice is usually 24 hours and warnings are often dropped from plane as well as sent by hand. According to our experience, warnings are practically always acted upon and villages vacated before attack begins. Every precaution is therefore taken to ensure that loss of life among non-combatants is avoided or reduced to a minimum. It is perhaps worth mentioning that villages in tribal territory are usually small walled enclosures with loopholed towers and battlements, which only the presence of women and children distinguishes from fortresses.6. The alternative to aerial action has to be considered. Since we are reluctant to go back upon our present policy, no punitive expedition without occupation, we shall be driven upon the defensive on our border. In the meantime, a movement, capable of easy suppression by aerial action, will gain momentum, will tend to spread to different parts of the tribal area, will establish and organise connections with hostile elements in British India, will give rise to exaggerated reports of tribal intervention, and will give continuous and progressive impetus to subversive move-ments in India generally, and especially in North-West Frontier Province. This process may go on for weeks or even months, and, in the meantime, we shall be practically powerless to deal with the situation. We slwald have to wait until the situation has developed into armed incursion into our own territory. Although the Commander-in-Ohief does not consider that this would entail any permanent increase in our peace establishment, both he and we w-ould view with greatest misgiving a measure which would expose us to these dangers.7. It is not open to doubt that aerial action, taken in tribal areas in conditions above stated, is justified from humanitarian point of view. While it involves practically no loss of life, it often prevents, in very early stage, an incipient move-ment, on the one hand, from developing into a state of warfare, and, on the other hand, from giving encouragement to internal subversive movements, the suppression of which may, and often does, involve the use of force.8. It should be borne in mind that although the initial cost of bombing may be high, the ultimate expenditure on operations is comparatively small on account of the ability of air action to nip trouble in the bud, and thus avoid the emploj-ment of a large ground force in a prolonged and costly campaign. - In comparing the cost of operations, it should be remembered that medical treatment of casualties and outlay on pensions constitute a big recurring item in the cost of military operations, w-hereas casualties to air forces in operations against uncivilised or senii-civilised tribes are few and far between.9. For both international war and control of our tribes, therefore, we would urge retention of complete freedom of action, except bombing of open towns.No other country, except possibly France in Morocco, has a similar problem to deal with, and although we do not wish to make it more difficult for you to deal with the problem from an imperial aspect, we urge that the peculiar conditions in India should receive special consideration.10. If, however, for imperial reasons this is ruled out, we consider that retention of machine of a type similar to those at present maintained for work in co-operation with our land forces for reconnaissance, photographic and survey work, as well as for attack of armed combatants in the field, as an integral part of our war and peace establish-ment, is essential and can be justified.11. Our honourable colleague, Sir Fazl-I-Husain, is unable to subscribe to the distinction we have drawn between States and border tribes and between bombing open towns and villages of the Indian Frontier, especially on the ground that border tribes have no standing army, no aircraft, no cannons, no batteries, and their only firearm is a rifle.
