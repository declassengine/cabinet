this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1932.SECRET. Copy No.     9CP. 115 (32).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THERE are two questions of policy affecting Palestine on which I consider it essential to have a decision by the Government.   These are (1) The setting up of a Legislative Council. (2) Jewish immigration.In this memorandum these questions are dealt with so as to indicate briefly in regard to each the position as to existing commitments and action already taken; followed by a discussion of action now to be taken and the conclusions which I recommend for adoption.Detailed information on both subjects is given in the Appendix.Legislative Council.(I.) Commitments.His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to taking some action for the establishment of a Legislative Council by Article 2 of the Mandate, by the statements of policy published in June 1922 and in October 1930 and by a statement by the accredited representative at the 20th Session of the Permanent Mandates Commission at Geneva.(II.) Action already taken..Attempt to set up Council in 1923.Provision was made in 1922 by Orders in Council for the Constitution of a Legislative Council with an unofficial majority, which would be on an elective basis. An Arab boycott of the elections led to the substitution of an Advisory Council of officials.1929 Projiosals.Presh proposals for a Legislative Council were submitted by the High Commissioner in 1929. Consideration of these proposals was deferred in consequence of the disturbances of that year.1931 Proposals.Revised proposals were put forward by Sir John Chancellor in August 1931, but, in view of the appointment of a new High Commissioner (Sir Arthur Wauchope), the matter was held up.[6766] b
(III.) Action now to be taken.On the one hand, it may be argued, as Sir John Chancellor did, that it is impossible to continue to resist the pressure of the Arabs for a measure of self-government; further, that a Legislative Council might help to reconcile the conflicting interests of the Jews and Arabs. On the other hand, it must be noted that the Arabs have never acquiesced in the Mandate or its terms, and that there is little hope of their now accepting anything short of complete self-government, which would be incompatible with our Mandatory obligations and would produce complete chaos. Further, the Jews remain opposed to a Legislative Council in which they would be in a minority as against the Arabs. Also in present circum-stances it seems likely that a Legislative Council would accentuate rather than diminish friction between the Jews and the Arabs.If we were entirely free to decide, the balance of considerations would, I think, be clearly in favour of taking no steps at present for the establishment of a Legislative Council. In view, however, of our commitments, I am afraid that we cannot remain entirely passive.But it would be impolitic to seek to impose a form of Constitution for which there was no general demand and which both Arabs and Jews for different reasons at present regard as objectionable.Conclusion.I suggest, therefore, that the first step should be to endeavour to arrange for a Conference in Palestine between the Palestine Administration and repre-sentatives of the several communities, or, if such a Conference should prove impracticable, for separate discussions between the Palestine Administration and the various interested parties.If His Majesty&apos;s Government had not committed themselves publicly in 1922 to an unofficial majority, it would, I think, have been preferable to insist at the outset on an official majority. As things stand, however, this is net practicable, and it would seem best not to put forward any specific proposals as a basis for discussion, but merely to submit the question : What should be the composition of the unofficial element on the Legislative Council? and how should the unofficial members be appointed ? As regards the powers of the Council, it should be laid down as fundamental that they must be such as to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to discharge their Mandatory obligations. This would entail placing powers of veto and certification in the hands of the High Commissioner in the event of the Conference leading to agreed recommendations for the setting up of a Council with an rinofficial majority.It is conceivable that, failing agreed recommendations,- discussions might result in suggestions for a form of Legislative Council, acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, to which the Arabs would be prepared to agree, but to which the Jews would remain irreconcilable. In such an event great pressure might be brought to bear from the Arab side to induce His Majesty&apos;s Government to set up such a Council. To attempt to do so, however, in the face of the determined opposition of the Jews, would, in my opinion, be politically most undesirable, and likely to endanger public order and good government in Palestine.Should the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government to bring about such discussions prove fruitless, or should the discussions lead to no generally accepted conclusions, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be regarded as having done all that can reasonably be expected for the discharge of their commitments.Even if it should not be found possible to establish a Legislative Council as a result of such discussions, it may be that proposals could be formulated for the advisory co-operation of the Jewish and Arab communities with the Palestine Administration, through the medium of Consultative Committees, on specified subjects somewhat on the lines of the General Agricultural Council set up in 1930. This Council, in addition to officials, comprises representatives of the Arab, Jewish and German farming communities, the Salesian Fathers, who conduct an agricultural school near Jerusalem, the Hebrew University, the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association, and the Executive of the Jewish Agency. The new High Commissioner is, in fact, already seeking the co-operation of unofficial members ou local Committees, which have recently been composed of officials only.
Jewish Immigration.(I.) Commitments. The following are the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government: Mandate.(a) Under the Mandate, to facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced.1022 Statement of Policy.(b) By the 1922 Statement of Policy, to ensure that the volume of immigra-tion does not exceed the economic capacity of the country to absorb new arrivals.1930 Statement of Policy.   Prime Minister&apos;&apos;s Letter to Dr. Weizmann.(c) Under the 1930 White Paper, as interpreted by the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to Dr. Weizmann, to maintain the principle of absorptive capacity, in the determination of which purely economic considerations are alone relevant; Government control of immigration; and the proper application of the Immigration Regulations. The principle is accepted that in all works or undertakings carried out or furthered by the Jewish Agency, Jewish labour shall be employed. But if, in consequence of this policy, Arab labour is displaced or existing unemployment becomes aggravated, that is a factor to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to have regard. In the case of public and municipal works falling to be financed out of public funds, the claim of Jewish labour to a due share of the employment available, taking into account Jewish contributions to public revenue, is to be taken into consideration.Finally, the desirability is admitted of closer co-operation and consultation between the Jewish authorities and the Palestine Government, especially in regard to the preparation of the Labour Schedule, i.e., the half-yearly schedule by which the immigration of wage-earners is mainly regulated.Powers have been taken by Ordinance, with detailed regulations thereunder, to enable the Government to exercise proper control of immigration, with special provisions with regard to the Labour Schedule.Amendments of the Ordinance and Regulations have recently been made to improve generally the machinery for regulating immigration.Preparation of Labour Schedules.In the summer of 1931, the late High Commissioner, Sir John Chancellor, reported various steps he had taken to improve the machinery for co-operation between the Government and the Jewish Agency in the preparation of Labour Schedules. The new High Commissioner has already made proposals for improving further the machinery for determining the state of unemployment and the need for additional immigrants.A attitude of Jeivish A gency.The Jewish Agency formally accepted the absorptive capacity principle in 1922. But they have remained dissatisfied with its interpretation and application by the Palestine Government. Various attempts have been made by the Jewish Agency to secure relaxation of the existing Regulations, especially as regards wage-earners. Successive Governments, however, have maintained the principle of absorptive capacity and have refrained from interfering&apos; with the discretion of the High Commissioner as regards the number of wage-earning immigrants to be admitted under any Labour Schedule. The only exception to this policy was in May 1930, when the issue of certificates under the Labour Schedule was suspended pending the receipt and consideration of the report of Sir John Flope Simpson.(II.) Action already taken.(III.) Action now to be taken.[6766]b 2
In urging relaxation or a less restrictive interpretation of existing Regulations, the Jews have argued that the sanction of a larger Labour Schedule would encourage the inflow of subscriptions for the Jewish National, Home, and that this would allow of additional schemes of work, which would provide for, and so justify, the extra number of immigrants who would have been permitted to enter the country. This argument, which has recently been urged with some insistence, has not so far been accepted.IAttitude of Arabs.On the other hand, the Arabs, who are in any case opposed to or suspicious of anything designed to increase the number of Jews in Palestine, continue to complain that Jewish immigration is allowed in excess of the absorptive capacity of the country. They attribute the existing Arab unemployment largely to the immigration policy of the Government, and call for a complete prohibition of further Jewish immigration. They also resent the illicit immigration of Jews, wdiich the Palestine Government finds it difficult to check.It appears to me that to yield to pressure from either side would be both impolitic and inconsistent with the commitments and declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Also, to take out of the hands of the High Commissioner the determination of matters of fact such as the absorptive capacity at any given time, or the fair proportion of Jews to be employed on public works, would be both impracticable and unsound.Conclusion.In my opinion, the only policy which can consistently be adopted is to maintain strictly the principle of absorptive capacity; to leave the final determination of facts relevant to its application entirely in the hands of the High Commissioner and his officials acting under his direction; to encourage, as far as possible, co-operation between the Palestine Executive of the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Government in regard to Jewish immigration, and to continue, so far as the means of Palestine permit, the improvement in the machinery for determining factors necessary for the proper application of the principle of absorptive capacity. I am satisfied that Sir Arthur Wauchope can be relied upon not to apply this principle with undue rigidity.P. C.-L.Colonial Office, March 23, 1932.
142APPENDIX.Legislative Council. (I.) Commitments.Mandate.1. Article 2 of the Mandate provides, inter alia, that the &quot; Mandatory shall be responsible for placing the country under such political, administrative and economic conditions as will secure .... the development of self-governing institutions.....&quot;1922 Statement of Policy.2. The following appears in the 1922 Statement of Policy (page 20 of Cmd. 1700):-&quot;Nevertheless, it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to foster   the   establishment   of   a   full   measure   of   self-government   inPalestine.....   The first step was taken when, on the institution of a civil administration, the nominated Advisory Council, which now exists, was established .... it is now proposed to take a second step by the establish-ment of a Legislative Council.....&quot;1930 Statement of Policy.3. The following passages are taken from the 1930 Statement of Policy (page 4, Cmd. 3692) :-&quot; They (His Majesty&apos;s Government) have decided that the time has arrived for a further step in the direction of the grant to the people of Palestine of a measure of self-government compatible with the terms of the Mandate. His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly intend to set up a Legislative Council generally on the lines indicated in the Statement of British Policy in Palestine, issued by Mr. Churchill in June 1922.....&quot;&quot; . . . . they (His Majesty&apos;s Government) consider it in the interests of the population of the country as a whole that the further step now proposed should no longer be deferred.&quot;Permanent Mandates Commission.4. The Permanent Mandates Commission was informed at its Twentieth Session of the intention to set up a Legislative Council. The Permanent Mandates Commission in one of their special observations welcomed the statement.(II.) Action already Taken.Advisory Council, 1920.1. In October 1920 there was set up in Palestine, as a first step in the direction of representative institutions, an Advisory Council composed in equal parts of Official and nominated Unofficial Members. Of the ten Unofficial Members, four were Moslems, three were Christians and three were Jews.Attempt to set up Legislative Council in 1923.2. A further step was taken in 1922, when an Order in Council was passed for establishing a Legislative Council. The attempt to hold elections in 1923 failed owing to the refusal of the Arab population as a whole to participate.Offers to Arab Leaders.3. Two further opportunities were given to representative Arab leaders in Palestine to co-operate with the Administration in the government of the country, first, by the reconstitution of a nominated Advisory Council, but with membership conforming to that proposed for the Legislature Council, and, secondly, by a proposal for the formation of an Arab Agency.[6766] b 3
Advisory Council 1923.4. Neither of these opportunities was accepted, and, accordingly, in December 1923 an Advisory Council was set up consisting only of Official Members. This position still continues; the only change being that the Advisory Council has been enlarged by the addition of more Official Members as the Administration developed.Municipal and Town Councils.5. With the object of enabling the people of Palestine to obtain practical experience of administrative methods and the business of government and to learn discrimination in the selection of their representatives, Lord Plumer, who was High Commissioner for Palestine from 1925 to 1928, introduced a wider measure of local self-government than had previously obtained under the British regime by the establishment of Municipal and Town Councils.Proposals for Legislative Council in 1929.6. Sir John Chancellor considered the question on his assumption of the office of High Commissioner. He consulted representatives of various local interests and put forward certain proposals to the Colonial Office in June 1929. Discussion of the question was, however, suspended in consequence of the disturbances in August 1929.7. In June 1931 the Secretary of State asked the High Commissioner to consider the whole question in the light of the policy laid down and to submit proposals as to the best means of giving practical effect to that policy. The Secretary of State pointed out that it was clear that, having regard to the language used in the 1930 Statement of Policy, the question could not be allowed to remain indefinitely in abeyance.Revised Proposals for Legislative Council, 1931.8. Sir John Chancellor submitted his revised proposals in August 1931. They provide for a Council generally on the lines laid down in the Legislative Council Order-in-Council, 1922, but with an official membership of sixteen (excluding the High Commissioner) and an unofficial membership of eighteen, of whom five were to be nominated and thirteen elected. Of the five nominated members not more than three were to be Arabs and not more than two Jews. The apportionment of the unofficial seats to the various sections of the population was to be deferred until the census report had been received, when the allotment of seats as between the religious communities would be made in accordance with the figures of the population. Consideration of Sir John Chancellors revised proposals was deferred in view of the appointment of a new High Commis-sioner.   The population is roughly in the following proportions:  Moslems : three-quarters. Jews : one-sixth.Christians and others : one-twelfth(III.) Considerations Affecting Action now to be Taken. Sir John Chancellors Views.1. Sir John Chancellor, in putting forward his proposals in 1929, expressed the view that it would be difficult to resist much longer the demand for some form of legislative body, more particularly since the demands of the Arab community had become more insistent since the establishment of representative government in the politically less advanced territory of Trans-Jordan.2. The High Commissioner believed that the Arabs were then more favour-ably disposed to co-operation than they were in i923. He considered that, in view of the undertakings given and the offers made, it was impossible indefinitely to maintain the present position, and that unless some steps were taken before long, there was reason to think that political agitation against the Government might assume an objectionable and even a dangerous character.
Shaw Commission s Views.3. The Commission of Enquiry into the disturbances of 1929 expressed the view that the Arab people of Palestine were united in their demand for a measure of self-government. The Commission stated that it was their belief that a feeling of resentment among the Arabs of Palestine consequent upon their disappoint-ment at continued failure to obtain any measure of self-government was greatly aggravating the difficulties of the local administration (page 162 of Cmd. 3530).Financial Commission&apos;s Views.4. The Financial Commission which visited Palestine in 1931 referred in its Report to the desirability of the Government taking every opportunity of associating with itself representatives of the public, and pointed out that a Legislative Council, if and when established, would furnish the most effective machinery for this purpose.   (Page 8 of Middle East, No. 43.) -Arab Attitude.5. The Arab leaders have never formally recognised the Mandate. The indications are that whatever prospects there were in 1929-1930 of the Arabs co-operating in a form of self-government compatible with the terms of the Mandate, their attitude towards the Mandatory and the Administration has undoubtedly undergone a considerable change since the issue of the Prime Ministers letter to Dr. Weizmann in February 1931 (Middle East, No. 39). Their present attitude, so far as can be gathered, is one of non-co-operation with the Administration unless and until the Mandate is revoked.Jetvish A attitude.6. The Jewish attitude is and always has been one of opposition to any proposal to establish a Legislative Council, while the Jewish people are in a minority. It is true that the Zionist Organisation accepted the 1922 Statement of Policy with its proposal to set up a Legislative Council. They would no doubt argue that their acceptance must now be regarded as having been withdrawn in view of subsequent events, particularly the refusal of the Arabs to co-operate in the establishment of a Legislative Council in 1923. Moreover, it is understood that they would take the view that a Legislative Council would, in present circumstances, accentuate rather than diminish the friction between themselves and the Arabs.Present Position.7. The position appears to be that, on the one hand, the Arabs regard a form of self-government compatible with the terms of the Mandate as unaccept-ablc, and would refuse to co-operate, while, on the other hand, the Jews are definitely opposed to any proposal for a Legislative Council at the moment.8. The Jews and the Arabs are the two main sections of the community in Palestine, and it would therefore be a case of forcing upon the community as a whole a measure for which there is no general demand, and to which, in some quarters at any rate, there is considerable objection.Jewish Immigration.Mandate. (I.)-Commitments.1. Article 6 of the Mandate provides, inter alia, that the Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions.1922 Statement of Policy.2.   The following passages occur in the 1922 Statement of Policy (seepages 19 and 20 of Cmd. 1700) :-&quot; This (Jewish) immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at the time to absorb new arrivals. It is essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.&quot;
&quot; It is necessary also to ensure that persons who are politically undesir-able are excluded from Palestine. ...&quot;&quot;It is intended that a special committee should be established in Palestine, consisting entirely of members of the new Legislative Council elected by the people, to confer with the Administration upon matters relating to the regulation of immigration.&quot;1930 Statement of Policy.3. The following passages occur in the 1930 Statement of Policy (pages 20 to 22 of Cmd. 3692).&quot; In view of its responsibilities under the Mandate, it is essential that the Palestine Government, as the agent of the Mandatory Power, should be the deciding authority in all matters of policy relating to immigration, especially having regard to its close relation to unemployment and land development policy.&quot;&quot; Clearly if immigration of Jews results in preventing the Arab popu-lation from obtaining the work necessary for its maintenance, or if Jewish unemployment unfavourably affects the general labour position, it is the duty of the Mandatory Power under the Mandate to reduce, or, if necessary, to suspend such immigration until the unemployed portion of other sections is in a position to obtain work.&quot;&quot; It is clearly desirable to establish closer co-operation and consultation between the Jewish authorities and the Government, and the closer and more cordial co-operation becomes, the easier it should be to arrive at an agreed (labour) schedule, based upon a thorough understanding on both sides of the economic needs of the country.&quot;Prime Minister&apos;.? Letter to Dr. Weizmann.4. The following passages appear in the Prime Ministers letter to Dr. Weizmann (pages 6 and 7 of Middle East, No. 39) :  &quot; But the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government appears to have been represented as being that &apos; no further immigration of Jews is to be permitted so long as it might prevent any Arab from obtaining employment.&apos; His Majestjr&apos;s Government never proposed to pursue such a policy. They were concerned to state that, in the regulation of Jewish immigration, the following principles should apply, viz., that &apos;it is essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.&apos; &quot;   (White Paper, 1922.)&quot;That principle (the absorptive capacity principle) is vital to any scheme of development, the primary purpose of which must be the settlement both of Jews and of displaced Arabs upon the land. It is for that reason that His Majesty&quot;s Government have insisted, and are compelled to insist, that Government control of immigration must be maintained and that immigration regulations must be properly applied. The considerations relevant to the limits of absorptive capacity are purely economic con-si derations.&quot;&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government did not prescribe and do not contemplate any stoppage or prohibition of Jewish immigration in any of its categories. The practice of sanctioning a &apos; Labour Schedule&apos; of wage-earning immi-grants will continue. In each case consideration will be given to anticipated labour requirements for works which, being dependent on Jewish or mainly Jewish capital, would not be or would not have been undertaken unless Jewish labour was made available. With regard to public and municipal works falling to be financed out of public funds, the claim of Jewish labour to a clue share of the employment available, taking into account Jewish contributions to public revenue, shall be taken into consideration. As regards other kinds of employment, it will be necessary in each case to take into account the factors bearing upon the demand for labour, including the factor of unemployment amongst both the Jews and the Arabs. Immigrants with prospects of employment other than employment of a purely ephemeral character will not be excluded on the sole ground that the employment cannot be guaranteed to be of unlimited duration.
1&apos; In determining the extent to which Immigration at any time may be permitted, it is necessary also to have regard to the declared policy of the Jewish Agency to the effect that &apos; in all the works or undertakings carried out or furthered by the Agency it shall be deemed to be a matter of principle that Jewish labour shall be employed.&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government do not in any way challenge the right of the Agency to formulate or approve and endorse such a policy. The principle of preferential and, indeed, exclusive employment of Jewish labour by Jewish, organisations is a principle which the Jewish Agency are entitled to affirm. But it must be pointed out that if in consequence of this policy Arab labour is displaced or existing unemployment becomes aggravated, that is a factor in the situation to which the Mandatory is bound to have regard.&quot;(II.) Action already taken.Control of Immigration.The control of immigration is vested in the High Commissioner by means of an Immigration Ordinance and Regulations.Broadly speaking, the immigrants fall into three categories, namely (a) persons of independent means as defined from time to time by order ofthe High Commissioner;(b) those without capital, but with definite prospect of employment;(c) dependants of relatives in Palestine.The conditions governing the admission of immigrants under (a) are laid down in the Ordinance and Regulations. These conditions have been varied from time to time. It has recently been decided in the case of immigrants of &apos;: independent means &quot; who are not exercising a profession or skilled trade to add a new class of those possessing capital between  P. 500 and  P. 1,000, subject to the Chief Immigration Officer being satisfied that certain conditions are fulfilled : hitherto there has been a minimum of  P. 1,000 for such immigrants.The admission of immigrants under (b) is regulated in the case of wage-earners by half-yearly &quot;labour schedules&quot; drawn up by the Palestine Govern-ment after consultation with the Jewish Agency, and reflecting the actual state of the labour market from time to time.Excessive Immigration in 1925.In and about the year 1925 immigrants were allowed to enter the country in numbers that were far too large. A temporary economic boom, under which this excessive immigration took place, was speedily follovred by a slump. The situation was at its worst about the middle of 1927, when Jewish immigration was to all intents and purposes brought to a standstill. No labour schedules were issued during the year September 1927-September 1928. The situation was subsequently restored to a great extent, though there is still a Jewish (as well as an Arab) unemployment problem in Palestine.Improvement of Machinery for Controlling Immigration.In May, 1931, the Secretary of State asked for the High Commissioners views on the various questions concerning immigration referred to in the 1930 Statement of Policjr and the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to Dr. Weizmann. In July Sir John Chancellor reported the action which he was taking for improving the machinery in the desired directions. This comprised (1) an amending Ordinance and regulations which have now been framed to improve generally the machinery for regulating immigration; and (2) arrangements to promote co-operation between the Palestine Government and the Palestine Executive of the Jewish Agency in the preparation of the labour schedule. Estimates of the number of labour immigration certificates for the coming half-year are now prepared separately by the Chief Immigration Officer and the Jewish Agency. After the Agency&apos;s estimate has been examined by the Chief Immigration Officer, joint discussions take place with a view to reaching agreement, and opportunity is afforded for further discussion, if necessary, with the Chief Secretary or the High Commissioner before the schedule is settled in Executive Council.
The difficulties of immigration control are increased by the fact that every year from 2,000 to 3,000 Jews have settled in Palestine without permission, in the guise of temporary travellers or by evading the frontier control. This illicit immigration is known to, and much resented by, the Arabs; but it is unlikely that the Palestine Government will find it practicable to diminish its volume in existing circumstances.Efforts are being made to improve the machinery for arriving at more accurate figures of unemployment for use in determining the half-yearly labour schedule.Employment of Jewish Labour on Works financed out of Public Fxmds.The question of the increased employment of Jewish labour on Avorks financed out of public funds is still engaging the attention of the High Commissioner. In this connexion discussions between the Palestine Administration and the Jewish Agency have taken place with a view to reaching an agreed estimate of the Jewish contribution to public revenue. The result has not yet been reported by the High Commissioner.(III.) Considerations affecting Future Action.Attitude of Jewish Agency.1. The Jewish Agency is concerned to secure increased Jewish immigration into Palestine, and representations have been made on more than one occasion with a view to the relaxation of the conditions governing the admission of immigrants. The Agency has also endeavoured to induce the Secretary of State to intervene in the matter of the number of immigrants to be admitted under the half-yearly labour schedules. The Jewish Agency, although they formally accepted in 1922 the principle of absorptive capacity, have urged that the administration of the Immigration regulations should be delegated to them, including the determination of the number of persons to be admitted. Failing that, they have recently argued that in framing the labour schedule &apos;&apos; absorptive capacity&quot; should be determined not only by the actual number of openings for wage-earners for which, at a given date, it can be shown that there is a reasonable prospect, but also by the anticipated influx of new capital which would, it is claimed, be stimulated by a more generous allotment of labour certificates.It has not so far been found possible to accept the contentions of the Jewish Agency.Arab Attitude. .2. The Arabs are strongly opposed to Jewish immigration, and they complain that Jewish immigration has been allowed to flow freely since 1920, regardless of the economic capacity of the country to absorb the immigrants.   .3. Having regard to the general principle governing the volume of Jewish immigration, namely, that of the absorptive capacity of the country, the final decision on all matters affecting immigration must necessarily rest with the High Commissioner, who, with the assistance of his advisers, is in the best position to judge the capacity of the country to absorb immigrants and to reach an impartial conclusion. If and when a Legislative Council is set up, it will be necessary to consider whether a special committee should be established, consisting of members of the Legislative Council, to confer with the Administration upon matters relating to regulation of immigration.o
