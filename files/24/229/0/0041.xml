IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT.) B 0 R E T.P. 141 (32) 0 COPY NO.  yCABINET.COMMITTEE ON TRADE WITH    RUSSIA. SECOND REPORT,1,,        .      On the 3rd February 1952 (Cabinet 11 (52) Conclusion 7), the Cabinet approved cur Interim Report (CP0    61 (32))  in which we recommended (a)  the opening of negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador on the question of measures to improve the &quot;balance of trade between this country and Russia; and (h)  discussions with the Russian Trade Delegation an the possibility of obtaining security for further guarantees covering export credits in excess of twelve monthGo2, With regard to (a)9 tho cotirse of thenegotiations is set out in the Despatch dated 5th February-^ 19323 of the Secretary ef State for Foreign Affairs to H0Mo Ambassador at Moscow; Sir Lo Oliphanfs Memorandum dated 5rd March,, 1932, and Mr,. Bogom^loff13 letter to the Foreign Office of 18th March - all of which have been printed and circulated to the Cabinet&quot;
3. With regard to (b) , the Cabinet at their meeting on 20th April last (Cabinet 24 (32) Conclusion 1) had before thorn a riote (CP. 134 (32)) by the President of the Board of Trade covering a Memorandum by the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade to which was attached a Report by the Export Credits Guarantee Departments Advisory Committee.        In this Report the Advisory Committee in effect recommended the rejection as wholly inadequate of the only proposals for security which the Soviet Trade Representative has made and submitted a nev/ scheme for credits to bo granted during the next six months pending a final decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to their policy in regard to the general question of trade with Russia.4d The Cabinet deferred consideration of thosedocuments pending a Report from this Cabinet Committee5. At the Meeting of the cabinet.cabinet on the 20thApril the question was raised, whether the policy in regard to further credits is so bound up with the question of the Commercial Agreement that they could not in fact be separately dealt with and. settled.. Vc have carefully examined this question and are all agreed that the two issues are not so inseparably interlocked as to render necessary the postponement of a decision on the question of credits until one can be taken on the Commercial Agreement.
6. Determination of the Commercial agreement and restriction of imports from Russia give rise to a number of questions, e.g., the cash value of the Fisheries Agreement, the legal posi-tion of the Soviet Trade Delegation in London, and the probable financial and commercial effects of restricting imports from Russia into the United Kingdom, which are under urgent examination by the Departments concerned and will form the subject of a further Report to the Cabinet in the near futurec7. The President of the Board of Traderecommends that he should be authorised to request the Advisory Committee to proceed on the lines suggested in their Report, namely:-   that during the next six months they should be free to guarantee credits for  4*000,000., of which not more than  1 ?600,000 is to bo of a duration of more than 12 months? provided also that no credit should exceed 18 months from the shipment of the goods.       As the guaranteed Russian bills falling due during the next six months amount to  1,600,000
&apos;J l&apos;sJthis proposal would involve onlsr  2 j.400.,000 of additional credit and since the Department&apos;s Liability lu no .case exceeds 75% of the face value f figure 5 the contemplated increase of -Government, liability, will not be.more than  1^.800^000,8c For the foregoing temporary arrangements the Advisory Committee would not propose to make the deposit of security an indispensible condition provided that the instalments were spread to their satisfaction-.,      But in order to build up adequate reserves against the risk of default by Russia they would continue to fix such rates of premium as the3&apos;&apos; deem to be appropriate,90 Apart from the considerable employmentthat the adoption cf the Advisory Commit tee!R proposals will provide in certain depressed Indus-tries and in particular in the Machine Tool Industry,, the efficiency and stability of this Industry are very important from the point of view cf Imperial Defencej  (see Memorandum by the Secretary to the. Cabinet -- Appendix A)., whiles moreover,, if Russia now turns te Germany to supply her machine tool requirements^ the present opening In the Russian market, may be permanently lost.
10. On the other hand, in view of the admitted risks of these credits,  the Treasury consider that from the merely financial point of view, it would he desirable to reduce them), hut that from the point of view of giving employment, it would he a reasonable compromise to maintain the credits at their existing volume.     The Treasury would be willing, therefore, to agree that the previous proposals for obtaining security for bills of over 12 months should not be pressed, and that the credits which fall due during the next 6 months amounting to about  1,500,000 should be replaced by frosh bills tip to 18 months, on the understanding that the duration of tho bills should bo shortened so far as possible,11. It was pointed out that in effect this constituted a new proposal, as the Cabinet had left to tho discretion of the Export Credits Advisory Committee the amount of credits to be guaranteed, at 12 months or less and bad only asked the Committee to report to them about credits of more than 12 months, and further that the probable result would be that orders might be plaoed in the near future at 18 months for the full amount now proposed, and that subsequent orders at 12 months or less would, therefore, have to be refused.12. We have been unable to roach agreement on theproposals contained in CP.  134   (52) and accordingly submit the matter for decision by the Cabinet.13. We are, however, unanimously of opinion that a decisionon this matter at the earliest possible moment is most desirable. 14. We have been informed^ that the negotiations betweenthe Scottish Herring Industry and the Russian Purchasing Organisations are likely, in the course of the next week or-h   appendix II.
two, to reach a stage at which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Scotland, sine farther reminder from His Majesty&apos;s Government of the desirability of a substantial purchase of British herrings is advisable in the interests of the balance of trade between this country and Russia.   As soon as the question of the conditions on which future credits rhould be given has been settled, the Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, has at our request? undertaken to speak to the Soviet Trade representative ive in the sense suggested by the Secretary of State for Scotland.Signed on behalf of the Committee.

(This Doeumeh-t la the Property pf 51s Ma j e s ty13 Government .)britannic&apos; E C  R p t -COPY t-io .RADF WI^K. RUSSIA .Memorandum by the S^o^pta^^ to the Cabinet.At the Meeting of the Cabinet held on May 18th,during the dieovssion of the question of Trade with Soviet Russia the Prime Minister referred to the interest of the -&quot;0t2tiitt.ee of Imperial Defence.in the q\-eetion of machine tools.    There has not beer: time to obtain formal Reports from the Sub-Committees concerned, but it ir- thought the following information may be of interest to the Cabinet.3. &quot;he Committee of &quot;Imperial Defence is concernedir. the question before the Cabinet from two separatepoints  of viev, namely:-&apos;i) mhe importance of the machine tool industry from the point of view of British industrial mobilisation in time of war, which is under exa.mi.na-tion by the Principal Supply Officers Sub-Committee:. (ii) The great efforts that have been made in Soviet Russia to create a scheme of industrial mobilisation, for which machine tools, are essential&quot;.Z. Dealing first with the former point, during the late War, one, if not the principal, underlying causes of delay in the production of munitions y a3 the-1-
fact that the necessary machine tools did not exist in thin country and had to be obtained either by importation from the United States of America or manufacture in this country.    ?he Principal Supply Officers Committee,  in considering the needs of industrial mobilisation,has giver, considerable attention to this subject, and a. Technical Sub-Committee has been set up under the Chairmanship of Sir Gilbert Vyie .4. At this stage it is sufficient to mention that the Sue-Committee feels deep concern at the extent to which British industry depends upon foreign sources of supply for many types of machine tools required in time of war.    Although I have not been able to consult the Sub-Commit tee or its Chairman, I have no hesitation, from my knowledge of its proceed-inrs, in saying that anything which helps the machine tool industry is Important from the point of vie&quot;  of Imperial Defence.5. Turning to the second aspect,  the Committee of Imperial Defence has a special Sub-Committee which is dealing with industrial mobilisation in foreign countries and is  co-ordinating the work of the various Departments .   A good, deal of information has drifted in durina the last few years to show that Soviet Russia, like all the larger nations, inclu^inr ourselves, is preparing a scheme for the1 war mobilisation of industry, and there is much evidence to show that it is part of the development of the Five Years Plan.    &quot;here is evidence also that the provision of machine tools is one of the limiting factors?, and that they have been making cautious  enquiries both in Germany and in this country with a view to assisting them in overcoming the
6. Attention is invited to the fact that out of a total of  7,000,000 worth of orders placed with british  firms by Arcop in 1931,  over  3,000,000 represents orders for machine tools and cognate articles .    A list of firm? and the value of the orders placed with their, by Arcos is attached in the Appendix. Additional orders for such machinery as can be used ^or nrunition-Takinr, e .g., presses,  cranes, e^e ., have not teen included in this list.7. From this point of view the argument at first sight, so far as the Committee o^ Imperial Defence is concerned, would seem to be in favour of not givin? f&quot;? oilities to Russia for the purchase of machine tools.    On the other hand, the argument which always arises when questions of the supply of war material to foreign countries comes up, applies in this  case also, namely, that if they do not obtain their requirements in this country they will place their orders  elsewhere, to the benefit o^ rival industrial nati ons ,(Signed) M.?.A.Hanky,Secretary,  to the Cabinet .Whitehall Gardens,  B     1, - April 85, 1932.

APPENDIX II.o iSECRET. T.R.(52)  7.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON TRADE WITH RUSSIA. PURCHASE OF BRITISH HERRINGS BY RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade.The Secretary of State for Scotland informs me that the negotiations which have been taking place between the Scottish herring industry and the Russian purchasing organisations are likely in the course of the next week or two to reach a stage at which some further reminder fr^m His Majesty&apos;s Government of the desirability of a substantial purchase of British herrings is advisable in the interests of the balance of trade between this country and Russia. 2. The Foreign Office feel that any such reminderwould be more effective if given by the President of the Board of Trade, or by myself, to the Soviet TradeRepresentative than if it were given by the Foreign Secretary to the Soviet Ambassador, who might very likely plead ignorance of the negotiations.3. It would, I think, be undesirable to approach theSoviet Trade Representative until the question of the conditions cn which future credits should be given has been settled, but if the Committee approve, I suggest that when that point has been reached, either the President of the Board of Trade or I should speak to Monsieur Ozersky in the sen,m.edesired by the Secretary of State for Scotland.(Intd.) J. Coapartment, of Overseas Trade. 23rd April, 1952.
