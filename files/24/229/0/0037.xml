[This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed jor the Cabinet.   April 1932.SECRET.CP. L37 (32). Copy Nb..&apos;..$..... 1CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the Local Governments iu India.S. H.India Office, 18th April 1932.Government of India.TwO features of note are the recrudescence of Red-Shirt activities in part of Peshawar District and the celebration of National Week. ,.,At present the revival of the Red-Shirt agitation is confined to part of the Peshawar District, north of Kabul Riven The immediate occasion was the organi-sation of opposition, to sthe election, and this, was successful in several places. The attitude of crowds in some places was violent and there were several clashes with the police. These manifestations quickly subsided, but there is reason, to believe that determined attempts will be made to hold demonstrations in Peshawar during the Viceroy&apos;s visit, and especially on the 20th, when  the. new Constitution is inaugurated. Arrangements have been made to prevent these, but there is a definite danger, of serious clashes which may react upon the situation in the Province. On the other hand, present information indicates that the /recrudescence is confined to ;:a -comparatively small area, the&apos; rest of the Province being quiet. There is also considerable resentment against the Red-Shirts. If there is no serious disturbance during next week, the effects of the local revival will probably be ephemeral.2. National Week was celebrated from 6th to 13th April, Congress making special efforts to rouse public interest. The results, however, were singularly small. There was serious disorder at Allahabad, where resort was made to violence on a considerable scale, but the situation was brought under control within two or three days. There was also activity at Cawnpore, but the. position there is now better than before National Week began. Apart from slight hooliganism on the 13th, the Week in Bombay City has proved an almost complete.failure.   ; ,     .        .,Elsewhere, throughout India, its effects were negligible. Several Provinces report that the Week passed almost unnoticed. .  , , . ,...Bombay.All is quiet in the districts, where National Week was not observed at all. In Bombay city the Week proved an almost complete failure, and, notwithstanding intensive propaganda, small attempts to carry out. parts of the programme were ill-supported... and easily frustrated. A Jallianwalla Day procession was attempted .ou 13th April and attracted a crowd, which, after the dispersal of the procession,, demonstrated against the police and lighted three, small bonfires. The dispersal of the crowd ^necessitated two cane charges. There, was a partial hartal on the .13th, and the majority of the druggists&apos; shops were again closed. Picketing is. being conducted - on a reduced scale. Some additional Swadeshi shops: in, Mulji . Jet ha Market were opened by Mrs. Naidu on ,the 11th, and foreign, cloth dealers are now taking the matter up with their association. A meeting of share brokers--on the 13th decided to adhere to the practice of doing business: on three days a week.Ordinance 2.   Section 3, arrests 12.   Total number of persons under detention 73. Section 4, orders 19.   Total in force 824.   Section 21, convictions during the week 23. Under Ordinance 4, Rs. 34,0 IS were forfeited last week and Rs. 142 this week.86260   4.32
Bengal.Interest in the civil disobedience movement is flagging notwithstanding efforts to celebrate National Week. The movement is practically dead and such activities as occur are insignificant. Section 3, arrests 11. Section 4, orders issued OS. Approximate number in force 1,312.   Convictions 187.Madras.The situation is unchanged.   &quot; National Week &quot; passed off without incident and attracted little attention.North-West Frontier Province.Polling concluded throughout the Province without any serious incidents except in the sub-divisions of Mardan and Charsadda of Peshawar District. In these sub-divisions determined efforts to interfere with voters were made by large crowds, including women and children, the former carrying Rorans on their heads. These efforts were largely successful. The crowd was organised by Red Shirt agitators and the situation in several areas necessitated troops assisting the police in dispersing crowds, the latter being armed with lathis and resorting freely to stone-throwing. The police on being heavily stoned in an area south-east of Mardan, were compelled to fire, the police casualties being 12 injured (two seriously). The only casualty amongst the rioters, as far as can be ascertained, was one killed. On the conclusion of the poll the situation became quieter, but from reports received the Red Shirts intend making further efforts for massed demonstrations in Peshawar during the Viceroy&apos;s visit. A Charsadda column, on 14th April, supported the police in collecting fines at Prang, near Charsadda, without incident. Section 3, arrests, nil ; total detained, 3, Section 4, orders during the week, 140 ; total orders in force, 1,543.On 12th April a hostile lashkar of Upper Mohmands, under the leadership of the son of the Mullah of Chaknaur, invaded Gandao Valley, their object being retaliation against the Halimzais for assistance recently rendered by the latter to the British Government. The lashkar occupied and burnt several Halimzai villages. On receiving notice that bombing would be carried out against them unless Halimzai Valley was evacuated, the Upper Mohmand lashkar immediately withdrew and the -situation is now normal. In Bajaur the situation is normal. The road from Dir to Chakdarra has now been opened to Europeans travelling by motor vehicles.Punjab.The Province generally is quiet. Dr. Kitchlew, in Amritsar, is actively negotiating -with the Sikhs for their open support for Congress, and has succeeded in staging two demonstrations. Neither of these were, however, of capital importance. The future developments of this movement are uncertain. In Sialkot, Ahrar leaders have imported 62 alleged refugees from Kashmir, and are endeavouring to resuscitate the Jathabandi campaign, but hitherto without success. Political arrests under ordinary law, 20 ; under Ordinances, 13. Totals to date, 540 and 793, respectively. One person is detained under section 3. Seven fresh orders issued under section 4 ; total persons so served, 75.   Total under restraint for infraction of such order, 19.&quot;United Provinces.The celebration of National Week was attended with little enthusiasm anywhere except at Allahabad and Cawnpore, and connected demonstrations were easily controlled by the police. Another procession on 9th April at Allahabad resulted in a renewal of the disturbance reported last week, and owing to continual stone and brick throwing, resort was had to firing. Thirty rounds were discharged, and the casualties amounted to 2 killed and about 20 injured. The situation is now quiet. Conditions at Cawnpore have been much improved by the introduction of an additional force of armed police in the Cloth Market area. No order has been issued under section 3, but 30 have issued under section 4, Emergency Powers Ordinance. Eight convictions for defying order under section 4 have been recorded. Convictions during the week: under Ordinances, 114; under ordinary law, 171. Total to date, 8,161.   Releases, 1,646.Central Provinces.There is still nothing to report.

Ten under-trials have been released and 674 remain in custody. The price of paddy is rising slightly, but still remains under 100.
