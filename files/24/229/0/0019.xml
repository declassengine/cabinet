CIJjCUiaT 1017 OF PAPEP^ TOJiABIITE?The Prime Minister said that his attention had teen drawn to cases where misunderstandings had arisen between Government Departments owing to the circulation to Cabinet Committees of Memoranda from, one Department without previouo consultation with Ministers at the head of other Departments that might be affected.    The exercise of the right to circulate Papers should, he suggested,   depend on the nature and circumstances of the matte rs to which they referred.    This was especially important in cases where a. Minister might wish to circulate comments bearing on the business of another Department.    It must always be remembered that documents of this iinl could not be confined to Ministers,, but would often have to be referred by the Ministers concerned for technical examination in their respective Departments, and inter-Departmental friction might be caused.    Where such possibilities existed it would generally be advisable that there should be prior consultation between the Ministers concerned; and in cases of doubt the Prime Minister himself, or the Chairman of the Committee,    should always be consulted. In the case of tha Defence Departments a special oo-ordiriat machinery was available in the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committe which could discuss such matters in their technical aspects and submit a report,  if necessary, before the subject was discussed by Ministers from the political poirt of view. When the time available was very short, the difficulties were, of course, increased,, but he invited Ministers to exercise the most sympathetic consideration for the cireum-stances of colleagues and to bear in mind always the importance of mutual co-operation between Departments *
ARRANGMEKTS FOR GENEVA.    RSPRESaiTATIOIfTHE PRIME MINISTER, after consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  said that he understood Sir John Simon was prepared to go to Geneva on April.11th when the discussions re-opened, and that he would remain there&quot; fcr approximately a fortnight.      It would be necessary for other Ministers to be available either to assist Sir John Simon or to take his place when he had to  return, and he proposed that arrangements should be made by Sir John Simon with the other Ministers concerned.    He understood that Mr.  Stimson was on his way to Geneva now and would arrive there on the 16th of April and would stay  appro-ximately till  the end of the month, after which it was possible that he might come to this country.      He himself would like to be at Geneva while Mr. Stimson was there, but he did not think it possible that he could leave this country before the 20th, and,  provided nothing intervened, he would hope to arrive at Geneva on April  lot.    He  .&apos;;ould stay there as long as possible so as to have conversations with Mr. Stimson.He understood from Sir John Simon that most other countries had arranged for political representatives to serve on the various  technical Sub-COmmittees, and he agreed with Sir John Simon&apos;s suggestion  that we ought to Jo the same.    He proposed, therefore to arrange with the Ministers concerned for
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries to represent this country on the appropriate technical committees. He realised that this might be putting some strain on the Departments 3 but he thought that, by mutual arrangement, the difficulties could be reduced.polj.gy op the british g07epnment a.t &quot;geneva. &quot; .THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following papers . -(i) Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary, (D.C.(M)(32) 10).(ii) Budgetary Limitation:Memorandum by the Chancellor cf the Exchequer, (B.C.(M)(,?2)  3).(iii) Bombing from the Air:Note by the Secretary of State for Air covering Memorandum by the Air Staff, (D.C.(M)(32)  7)memorandum by the First Lord of tho Admiralty.(D.C.(M)(32) 11).(iv) International!aatien of Civil Aviation: Note by the Secretary of State for Air covering Memorandum by the Air Staff, (D.C. (M)(32) 9).(v) Qualitative Disarmament:Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for War,f TD.C.(M)(32)  13).(vi) Memorandum prepared in the Admiralty, (B.C.(M)(32) 14).THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Committee should take as the basis of their discussion the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, circulated       Paper No. D. C. (M)(32) 10, dated
March 31st, 1932, and that they should divide their discussion into the three sections which Sir John Simon had made in his Paper,I.      Equality of Treatment.SIR JOHN SIMON explained t* the Committee that, after much thought, he had put down suggestions under this heading as being the only reasonable middle course solution which we could pursue. He realisedfully the difficulties of this cjurse and made it quite plain that it would, in fact, mean putting a time limit to ParUV of the Treaty cf Versailles.      He explained that his own xdea was to have,  if possible,  some general line from the Cabinet on the attitude that we should adopt, but at the same time he would ask for complete discretion as to when, if ever, we developed this line. At the present moment,  owingto the election issues in b^th Prance and Germany, he thought it probable that these two countries would be content merely to stake cut a claim, and he would do his best to prevent this dualegue developing into anything too acrimonious or damaging to the success of the Conference. He also thought that his suggestion might make an appeal to sentiment in the United States. He realised,  of course, that it did net satisfy the complete German claims, nor might it be very acceptable to Prance, hut he thought that it might he possible to persuade Germany to accept something on these lines.After some further general discussion on matters of detail connected with  the Foreign Secretary&apos;s
(a)  on the German claim i for &quot;Equality cf Treatment&quot;  and the French insistence on the sanctity of the Treaty of Versailles, to approve generally the conclusions set forth in paragraph 14 of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; Memorandum D.C.(M)(32) 10, (See Annex A)  and to authorise the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to act on them if and when he should deem necessary wr desirable. At the same time the Foreign Secretary was asked to bear in mind that everything possible should be done to avoid the issue between France and Germany beingg raised in an acute form at the present time, it being felt that the longer the problem could be postponed the more likely would a solution be facilitated.proposals, it was agreed to recommend, the following conclusions for the approval of the Cabinet on the attitude to be adopted by che British Delegation to the question of Equality of Treatment.
(2)    Security.THE COMMITTEE next considered the French security thesis and the proposals set cut in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum (D.C.(M)(32)10),   and particularly the suggestions contained in paragraph 17.    Particular attention was drawn to the  suggestion contained in the first sentence of paragraph 17 (e),  which reads;  &quot;It would he a matter for consideration whether, without joining In any new   regional agreement, we should he prepared to undertake to give no assistance to the party which is the aggressor&quot;.    It was emphasized that,  in no case would  the Dominions &quot;be parties to any sort if guarantee, and it was also suggested that this might imply a blockade by us of another country.    At the  same time  it was emphasized that we were already committed  to some   extent under Article 16 of the Covenant,   and that in any case we should presumably    have     complete discretion as to whether or not we took action.    It was also noted that,   although the United States would never announce publicly that they.might be prepared to undertake  to give no assistance to any party deemed an aggressor, in actual practice   theymight follow any lead which we might give in this direction. It was further remarked that the more completely the French plan was destroyed,  the more likely would it be for the French to adopt an utterly negative attitude to any other proposals, and it was suggested that there were in reality two courses open,  one of which was to submit to France,   and the other of which was to isolate France.    It was agreed that in any case we could not contemplate  submission to France.THE COMMITTEE agreed:(b)    on the question of   &apos;security&apos;   to approve generally the proposals set forth in paragraph 17 of the Secretary of State for    Foreign Affairs Memorandum (D.C. (M)(32)10)   (See Annex B);  and to note that the suggestion in sub-paragraph (e) that &quot;without  joining in any new regional agreement,  we should be prepared to undertake to give no assistance to the party which is the   &quot;aggressor1&quot;,  is a project not for present, but for possible future consideration,.and is a matter on which the Dominions are known to hold strong views.-G-
(3)   Qualitatiye Disarmament.THE COMMITTEE next considered the third part of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs memorandum, dealing with Qualitative Disarmament,  and in particular they had under consideration the Question cf the abolition or restriction of t anks,  and the abolition cr restriction of bombing.On the Question of tanks it was pointed out that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in Paper No: D.C.(M)(32)13 had made the definite suggestion in paragraph 6,  that heavyat the  same time he had put forward the suggestion that &quot;bombing aeroplanes, heavy guns and heavy tanks are all weapons contrived to overcome the r esistance of fortified positions and break dov/n the resources of the defence.    The role of the  tank is slightly different in action, but bombing aeroplanes and heavy guns fulfil precisely the  same function and must receive similar treatment.    It is useless to abolish one and not the other.    All three really, however, form an independent whole and should stand or fall together.&quot;SIR JOHN SIMON said that he was quite  satisfied with the Chief of the Imperial General Staffs proposal as r egards tanks, which was,  in fact,  all he wanted.Abo I ition of bombing or b omb i ng aircraft..THE COMMITTEE had a very considerable discussion on this question, during which it was apparent that there was some divergence of views.    There was general agreement that the propos-als outlined in paragraph 31  (a)  (b)  (c) and (d) of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; memorandum (See Annex C) were] impracticable 5 that is to say,  it was not possible to prohibit the possession of bombing aeroplanes on account of the difficultiesTankstanks,  I.e.  tanks of over 16 tons-,could be abolished;
of defining a bombing machine ? that it would hardly &quot;be possible to prohibit all military aeroplanes of every kind;  that the internationalisation of civil aviation did not appear to be either desirable or feasible,  and that it was obviously out of the question to attempt to abolish flying altogether.    It was then suggested that the best way of tackling this problem was perhaps more on quantitative than qualitative lines,  and that the aim should be to restrict very rigidly military aircraft and their horse-power.    It was also pointed out that even if a Convention was signed prohibiting bombing,  it was very unlikely that it would be observed in time of war,  and that it would not mean any relaxation of protective measures  in peace time. On the otner hand it was put forward strongly that public opinion at home took greater interest in this question of bombing, which might intimately affect them,  than In the majority of the other erjxLitative disarmament proposals, and that the Government might find themselves in a position of some embarrassment if we did not declare ourselves openly for the abolition of bombing.SIR JOHN SIMON said he had considered very carefully the papers which the Air Staff had submitted,  and he had given much thought generally to this question and had come to the conclusion that there was no practical way out of the difficulty other than to prohibit the act of bombing,  and he was particularly impressed with the advantage which would accrue to this country if it should be possible to secure such prohibition, because London was more exposed and vulnerable to air attack than the capital of, perhaps,  any ether State.    He quite realised that even if an international convention&apos; was signed prohibiting the act of dropping bombs:,  this convention might, still be violated, but it seemed to him that the prohibition of bombing would do something to reduce armaments and expenditure,  and also  to meet public opinion.
SIR SAMUEL HOARE emphasized that the Government of India attached very great importance to retaining the use of aircraft on the frontier,  and he imagined that the same thing applied also to &quot;Iraq, and Palestine.    He was of opinion that the proposals for dealing with aircraft, suggested in the Draft Disarmament Convention, were the only really practical ones,  and he was extremely nervous at the moment of our making any resounding statement which might not he carried out.LORD LONDONDERRY said nobody realised more than he  thebenefits that would accrue from the abolition of bombing, butit seemed to him to be a Utopian picture,    He had already circulatedpapers on this question, and did not ivish to- enter into any further detailed arguments across the tsble until he had had time to consi-sider the proposals in the paper circulated a few hours before the-Committee met-   He emphasized the dangers of subscribing toany such convention,    which would almost certainly be violateddirectly war broke out,  just as the Hague Convention regardinggas was violated in the last war.    He also emphasized thatthe only real remedy against air attack was retaliation,  andalthough it would obviously be difficult to produce such an argument at a peace conference,  the Service Departments had to look at the position which might occur in time of war.THE PRIME MINISTER, while agreeing that it might not be possible to stop bombing in war time,  even though a convention was  signed in peace,  felt that such a convention might prevent a full-blown offensive being developed at zero hour, which was,  in fact, the real danger to which London might be exposed.    He could not help agreeing generally with the Foreign Secretary, but he would like the Service Departments to realise that nothing would be signed by us which was not signed by everyone else, and which was not as water-tight as any such international document could be made.    He could not help being impressed with the fact that public opinion might become restive if we adopted a purely negative attitude to the one form of disarmament which might actually affect the nan in the streetin this country; but ho would emphasize again that wo should not-9-
enter into any agreement whatever unless it was of the most conrprehe naive international complexion,  and unless it was completely safeguarded at every turn.The  suggestion was made that it might bepossible to consider the framing of very strict rules forbombing,   and also that  there would be every advantage if theItalian proposal for the complete abolition of aircraft carrierscould be achieved, and it was further put forward that these should be added to the Memorandum,  circulated by the CIS. S. ,  in para-graph (c)  on page 10, a paragraph advocating the reduction of air-craft carriers, and possibly even their total abolition.CONCLUSIONS.(c)    On the question of qualitative disarmament, THEC OMMITTEE agr e e d:-to approve generall3r the following extract from the conclusions of the memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (D.

(E.) (32) 10)  and the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (D. C . (M) (32)  3) .After seme considerable discussion, during which the difficulties of applying budgetary limitation,  due to  fluotua-tions in currency,  and also to the fact that each country was at liberty to insert whatever figures it pleased, were emphasised, it was agreed that, despite these disadvantages, it might be found difficult for us to return a blank negative on this question when the discussions arose at Geneva;    at the same time it was emphasised that no practical scheme had yet been produced, and  the production of such a scheme was essential before any final  dooisibn could be given on this matter.
CONCLUSION .It was agreed:(g)    on the question of budgetary limitation the United Kingdom Delegation should not present a blank negative, but should be given discretion as to how they deal with this matter when the discussions arise at Geneva.Discretionary Powers of the British Delegation.The Cabinet Committee realise that at the present stage of the Disarmament Conference it is impossible to foresee in what circumstances particular questions may arise, or what opportunities may present themselves for useful intervention by the United Kingdom Delegation.    In these circumstances they feel that latitude must be left to the Delegation in interpreting decisions taken for their guidance, and discretion as to the method and time of their intervention in any matters arising at Geneva, with the proviso    that,  should new questions of principle arise on which no Cabinet instructions have been received,  the matter should be referred for further instructions. This would apply equally to any case where it is found impossible to carry out the instructions of the Cabinet.SUMMARY CP C0KCLU5I0IT3 PIT POLICY.The conclusions of Policy are, for the convenience of theCabinet set forth below:-(a) On the German claim for &quot;Equality of Treatment&quot; and the French insistence on the sanctity of the Treaty of Versailles, to approve generally the conclusions set forth in paragraph 14 of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs Memorandum D .0.(11) (32)  10 ,   (See Ann ex A)  an d to authorise the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to act on them if and when he should deem necessary or desirable.

ANiEKX   Ao&apos; 14.      The following conclusions on this head arc suggested for consideration :-(a) A distinction must; be dra?ai between the legal contention that, in the events which have happened, Germany-is ^discharged from observing Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany&apos;s moral claim for reconsideration in view nf the preamble to Part V, the Clemenceau letter,  and her subsequent admission to the League.       Without admitting that germany is released from Part V en the ground that the subsequent condition of corresponding disarmament by others has not been fulfilled (for who could define what degree of disarmament by others would fulfil such a condition?), it may well be conceded that an expectation r-f more rapid disarmament by others was created, vrtiereas, in fact,  while Germany has been bound by a fixed limit, no corresponding reduction has taken place in other countries.       The moral claim of Germany is very strong..(b) Equality in the method of treatment is not   thesame thing as equality in the figure of armaments,     Germany&apos;s claim for relief in point of status will evoke the greatest degree of sympathy if she does not seek tp increase the sum total of her armaments.(c) On this basis we should search for a means of meet-ing Germany&apos;s claim,ii to improved status.       If our proposals for the abolition sf certain weapons of war, which Germany under Part &quot;V of the Treaty is not permitted to have,  are adopted, this will tend towards a greater equalisation in the amount of armaments.        Per the rest, very large adjust-ments cannot be made suddenly.(d) The best mode of carrying out the above principles would seem to be fer the limits ^f German armaments,  as laid down in Part V, to be expressed as Germany&apos;s maxima,  in the same articles of the Disarmament Convention and by the same methods, ay are adopted in the case of other Powers,      This goes far to meet Germany9s grievance in point of status.      It is true that it will leave, in all   probability, a great disparity in figures, but the principle of equality of treat-ment would be established,(e) One result, which would not be palatable to Prance, would be that when the Disarmament Convention expires by effluxion of time (say, in seven or ten years), Germany would be released from limits which were imposed on her by the Armistice, and would-be free to put forward higher figures in the discussion for a new Convention.      (This view is contrary to the Spanish contention,, according to which limits fixed as the result of the present Disarmament Conference, though only fixed for a period of years, can, never be exceeded hereafter, without the concurrence of the^ &quot;council of the League.      See, however, as to this, D. C(M) (32)  5,)(f) If the British delegation taKera the line above suggested, it will not give satisfaction to either Prance *v Gernanv,. but that is the Inevitable result of taking up a
middle position.       Moreover,  the line suggested has this to commend it.      It meets the claim for equality of status in the only way in which it can he met without giving Germany leave to re-arm.       By so doing, it is calculated to oarn the sympathy, and perhaps the support, of some other nations. If the line proposed is approved, discreet enquiries might he made as to whether the Urlted States would not take up a similar attitude.(g)    There is one obvious objection which must be faced. By affirming that Part V of the Treaty of Versailles-i3 binding upon Germany while at the same time suggesting a new mods of treatment, we shall be- necessarily indicating to Prance that the breakdown af the Disarmament Conference will rivet Part V of the Treaty up**n Germany.       But there is no way erg securing that Prance will exert herself to make a success of tho Disarmament Conference on terms which are reasonable to Germany, unless, indeed, 3ritain is prepared to make an adequate contribution to Prance under the head of security.&quot;
10 0lo^ANNEX    B.&quot;17.     While rejecting the French thesis,  the following considerations suggest themselves as worth hearing in mind, though some of them cannot he publicly urged with much effect, and it is urgently to be hoped that they can be supplemented by other useful suggestions :-(a) The latest French memorandum of the 5th February does not formulate the plans for security which France has in mind.       Indeed, the memorandum, after elaborating plans placing civil aviation and bembing aircraft at the disposal of the League, and far the creation of an international force, goes on to say s-&quot;The measures without which the  above prsposals would be ineffective, and even unthinkable, include, amongst others, compulsory arbitration;    definition of the aggressor1;    guarantees as to the rapidity ef the decision of the  authority controlling the international force;      the bringing of the action of that authority into conformity with international law, which is still insufficiently precise, but the permanent avd contractual elements of which result from international treaties and pacts;      and the international control of the execution of all agreements concerning armaments.&quot;These provisions, in regard t* which the French delegation reserves the right to make concrete proposals, are an integral part of the enquiries carried out by the League of Nations during the last twelve years.         All the elements of the necessary solution are brought together........,,!It will, therefore, be reasonable to ask in the first place^ that the authors of the French plan should formulate mire precisely these essential proposals upon which, according to them, tho whole French claim depends.(b) The criticisms of the French plan for endowing th? League of Nations with an international force are really nubsidiary to this, but there is most effective materialfox- the purpose in&apos;Sir Maurice Hankey&quot; s Paper No. DoC:(M)(32) 4. Soo also Part 2 of tho Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum on the Disarmament Conference CoPo  78 (SS) which summarises the French claim and makes some criticisms^(c) We should refuse to subscribe to the proposition that further disarmament is impossible without further security. The Asoembly in 1928 adopted a resolution, which the French joined in, to the effect&quot;that the then existing degree of   ^ security was sufficient to warrant a degree of disarmament.Wo might ask France and her allies whether they really feel apprehensive as to the safety of their frontiers, and we nef-id not,  if necessary, refrain from quoting figures of military strength.18th Meeting of the Assembly, September  5th, 19
1 9 0 loo(a)    If it is alleged, in reply, that the frontiers of certain States in Europe,    e. g. , Pcland and Roumania, are insecure, it hy no means follows that the only form of security is a general undertaking   like the Geneva protocol.      The only form of security supplementary to that in the Covenant which has been effectually set up is the Locarno Treaty, and our objection to w.rid-wide commitments does not mean that we Bgould oppose regional guarantees between States on the Continent of Europe to meet their special anxieties, whether on the Locarno model or by the local application of more elaborate machinery such as that of the protocol for Identifying the aggressor, etc.(e)&apos;  It would be a matter for consideration whether, without joining in any new regional arrangement, we should be prepared to undertake to give no assistance to the party which is the &quot;aggressor,!&apos;       This raises difficulties in defining or identifying the aggressor, and also raises the question whether the United States would be prepared to give a similar assurance. Even if the United States felt unable to give such an assurance in advance, our example would make it very difficult for her to do other/lse when the time came.(f) While refusing to enter into new&apos; engagements in the name of security, we should emphasise that we recognise that we are bound by the engagements we had already entered into, viz,, Locarno and the Covenant. Our refusal to go further is based on a situation which has not changed since 1924, viz., war inability to assume unlimited, liability in every quarter of the world in quite unforeseeable circumstances.(g) We must emphasise our belief that the future of the Leaguo depends on the extent to which is succeeds in concen-trating and formulating the public opinion of the world with a view to keeping the peace,  and that we cannot embrace the conception of a super-State whose normal function is that of the international policeman.       This, it would be observed, is a direct challenge to the French thesis, e., &quot;In future we must seek in common action that security with each nation has hitherto endeavoured to obtain from its own forces alone ........     The present Conference offers the bestopportunity that has ever occurred to make a definite choice between a League of Nations possessing executive authority and a League of Nations paralysed   by the uncompromising attitude of national sovereignty Prance hes made her choice. She suggests that the other nations should make theirs1&apos;.&quot;
&quot;31.    The following proposals in connexion with &quot;bombinghave to be considered j-(a) Prohibit by Convention the possession ef bombing aeroplanes,  just as it is proposed to prohibit submarines.(b) Prohibit by Convention military aeroplanes of every sort.       This alternative has been suggested because of the view that (a) would not be practicable inasmuch aS bOiiibS might be dropped from military machines which are not specific-ally bombing machines&quot;.(c) Internationalize civil aviation,    Thi3 proposal is put forward because (b) would not necessarily prevent &quot; bombing in war-time if a State could use civil machines for the purpose of dropping bombs.      What exactly is meant by internationalizing civil aviation may be difficult to say, for the point to be secured must be that civil machines cannot be used in time of war by a combatant State for bombing purposes and in view ef a State&apos;3 power t*9 requisition and other circumstances, this seems a very difficult result to bring about.(d) Abolish flying.    This heroic remedy is suggested because of the difficulty of making (c) effective.35.      The considerations set out in the previous para-graph seram to sh^w that if a practical remedy is to be found, it must be saught in another direction.       Ls it possible, instead of seeking to prohibit a class of machine,  to prohibit a claspi cf act?       In other words, we must consider an a further alternative -(e) Prohibit by international Convention the dropping of bombs from the air.       This was in fact one of the previsions of The Hague Convention before the War.    If this Gonvcntion was observed, it would at any rate prevent bombing.      But the objection is takwiin some quarters that it would be going too far to try to prohibit all bombing, and in particular that bombing on military objectives should be permitted, and that . the dropping of bombs in areas like the North-Weet Frontier and the Hinterland of Aden is a civilising and persuasive process.       We therefore have tw* further variants to consider, viz.  1-(f) Prohibit the dropping of bombs save on military objectives with regulations designed t&amp; define those -objectives or otherwise to limit injury to civilians, e.g. , by giving notice.
(g)    prohibit the cirepping of bombs by one State on the territory or shipping of another sovereign State.Bomb--dropping in violation of the above restriction would be declared to be proof that the dropper was an aggressor.
