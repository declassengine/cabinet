ANGLO -DAN ISH COMJ^RCIAL RELATIONS..Early in 1930,  consequent upon the adoption of&quot;restrictive measures by Germany towards imports from Denmark, a movement originated, in Denmark to boycott German goods.    This   had the effect of stimulating a latent desire for increasing purchases of British goods.      Pear of political repurcussions, however, caused the boycott to be frowned upon by the Authorities,  and it was stopoedo     The &quot;Buy British&quot; movement was based upon e recognition of the fact that the United Kingdom market was vital to Danish orosperity,  and that there was a bad disproportion between Danish exports to this country and United Kingdom exports to Denmark.,    The first concrete signs of orogress were the formation of the British Imoort Union, composed of a number of agents in Cooenhagen for British manufacturers,  and the organisation by this body of a successful though not very reoresentative exhibition of British goods in Copenhagen oarly in 1931c    This was followed in the course of 1931 by the founda-tion of an influential Dano-British Association,  primarily for cultural objects.    Both these organisations devoted considerable attention by oropaganda and other practical steps to the initiation of measures intended to influence the flow of British goods into Denmark.      Concurrently the agricultural society known as  &quot;Twelve Men&apos;s Association&apos;1, whose early activities had been social in character, began to interest themselves more ooenly in political and economic questions affecting their industry.A great stimulus was given to this movement by the advent to power of the National Government with the declared oolic:^ of adjusting the trade balance of this country.    Both
boin the Danish, press and on public platforms in Denmark active steps were taken by influential men to bring home to the Danish public, co-operative societies, farmers, merchants and industrialists, the wisdom of increasing their imports of British goods.    In addition to this propaganda various concrete Bteps have been taken.Under the auspices of the Dano-British Association a private &quot;Import Committee&quot; has been formed in Denmark for the purpose of investigating for what further British goods a market can be found in Denmark, and how the sale of goods already in the market can be increased.    This Committee comprises the Presidents of the four principal Associations representative of industry, agriculture, shipping and commerce, and is in part conducting its investigations in this country.An exhibition of United Kingdom goods upon a comprehensive scale,  to take place in Copenhagen in the autumn   of this year, is being organised and financed by the i3ritish Import Union of Denmark.      The canvassing of United Kingdom exhibitors has been entrusted by the organisers to the Federation of British Industries, who are working in the closest co-operation with the Department of Overseas Trade.The Danish Minister in London and the Department of Overseas Trade, acting in collaboration, have been able to arrange influential and representative honorary committees both in Denmark and in London of such a character as to enable H.R.H. The Prince of Wales and H.R.H.  The Crown Prince of Denmark to accept the  joint patronage of the exhibition. Concurrently, and in conjunction with this exhibition, an all-British exhibition of art in industry is being arranged to take place in Copenhagen.These independent movements have been initiated by Danes in Denmark itself, but in each case the movement has acted in collaboration with the Department of Overseas Trade and
His Majesty1s Representative in Copenhagen, whose endeavours have been directed towards the reconciliation of conflicting local interests and the co-ordination of the general movement.As regards the attitude of the Danish Government, His Majesty&apos;s Minister has, upon a number of occasions, received assurances by Ministers of their definite desire and policy to encourage and promote the importation of British goods, though naturally they are unable to take any overt action to demonstrate this.    Sir Thomas Hohler has been informed in confidence by the Minister of Commerce and by the Currency Control Oommissioner that the object of the Currency Control organisation is definitely to encourage British trade.Apart from this   benevolent attitude in the provision of exchange, the Danish Government in 1951 purchased ten times more guns and arms from the United Kingdom than from any other country,    They have, for the last few years, purchased all the motors and machines for their Air Force from this country, and have now issued orders that motor vehicles for military use are to be bought here, instead of from the United States.    A party of Military and Naval Officers is at present visiting works in this country: hitherto these visits have been made to works on the Continent.Three important Government contracts are at present under consideration,  and it is hoped that if and when they are placed,  they will be awarded to British firms,    They are:  (a) Electrification of Copenhagen Suburban Railways;  (b) Three ferryboats      (though these will be constructed in Danish yards, the steel required will probably be acquired in this country)% (c)  Storstrom Bridge.    This will be the longest in Europe, and is estimated to cost  2,000,000,    Owing to financial considera-tions this contract may not mature for two or three years unless reasonable financial facilities can be obtained on the London market.
The State Railways,  in regard to its requirements in coal for the six summer months, have increased their purchases of British coal as compared with last year.A number of examples of the existence of a similar tendency could he quoted, hut it will suffice to say that there is a wide-spread desire amongst the various agricultural societies, dairies, bucon factories and the like,  to buy British goods as far as possible;    the Municipality of Copenhagen has of late awarded several large contracts to British firms,,    It may also be stated that 980 Danes visited the recent British Industries Fair,  or nearly twice as many visitors as from any other single country.In pursuance of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to redress the balance of trade,  the Department of Overseas Trade is endeavouring to ensure that every advantage is taken of the present favourable opportunity to secure a larger share of Denmark&apos;&apos;s import trade.    A special meeting of the Overseas Trade Development Council, which sits under the Chairmanship of the Secretary for Overseas Trade, was eailed on 16th February to consider the subject,  at which,  in addition to the usual members of the Council, representatives of a number of industries and of Government Departments concerned were invited to be oresento    His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Copenhagen also attended and addressed the Council on the favourable sentiment prevail-ing in Denmark.During the discussion at the Council it became clear that the Danish market had been neglected by certain industries and that in others a closer examination of the possibilities would be desirable.    It was agreed by the representatives present that they should review their position in the market and consult with the Department and the Council.    A number of these consultations have already taken place,  as a consequence of which
oractical measures are already &quot;being adopted in order to ensure that whsrever possible the favourable Danish sentiment should &quot;be turned into actual business.When the private &quot;Import Committee&quot; of the Dano-British Association have had sufficient time to carry out the investigation referred to early in this memorandum,  and the conversations which are &quot;being conducted by the Deosrtment of Overseas Trade and industrialists on the other hand have reached a more advanced stage,  it is contemplated that a meeting either in this country or in Denmark should take nlace &quot;between the two sides.    His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Denmark will be asked to watch progress and to reoort when the time for such a meeting would &quot;be orooitious.J.C.
