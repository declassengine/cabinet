THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1932.MOST SECRET. Copy No.   591087-B.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B.)Note by the Treasury on the Annual Review for 1932 by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (1082-B).[Circulated by Request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.]1. The Annual Review of Imperial Defence policy by the Chiefs of Staff covers a wide field. The present note is confined to financial and economic aspects of the important questions of policy that are involved, and for this purpose it is not necessary to touch on every point raised, in the Review.2. The three concrete points on which the Chiefs of Staff express anxiety in regard to Government policy are (1) The defenceless condition of Imperial interests in the Far East.(2) Our inability to fulfil possible major commitments which, apart fromthe Far East (including the defence of India), &quot;means those arisingout of war in Europe. (3) The so-called ten years&apos; rule &quot; that it should be assumed for purposesof framing the Estimates for the Fighting Services that at any givendate there will be no major war for ten years.&quot;And it is represented that (1) and (2) have arisen out of (3). We proceed to submit considerations which we think should be borne in mind in considering these points.3. The question of the defence of Imperial interests in the Far East is raised by the Chiefs of Staff with special reference to the present Sino-Japanese dispute, and they point out that in present circumstances we are unable to resist Japanese aggression in the Far East. It may be granted that recent events have demonstrated not only to ourselves but to other countries, and particularly, no doubt, to Japan, that we are not at the present time in a position to defend our interests and possessions in the Far East against Japan. It may be granted, too, that Japan has thereby been tempted to actions which have involved great dangers not only to our interests in China, but to the peace of the world, and that we cannot even yet estimate what may be the results of these actions or how far Japan will go. But when all this has been granted, what is the alterna-tive 1 To have put Hong Kong and Singapore in a condition in which they could be temporarily defended would not have been sufficient, though this in itself would no doubt have involved very substantial expenditure. The question would still remain whether we should be prepared to back these measures up with[6710]
major operations in Far Eastern waters, and whether Japan would believe that we were so prepared. It is submitted that Japan lias probably been influenced in embarking on her present course as much by our financial and economic difficulties and preoccupations as by our military weakness. The fact is that in present circumstances we are no more in a position financially and.economically to engage in a major war in the Far East than we are militarily. It would seem, therefore, that as regards the Far East we must for the time being be content with applying such deterrents as may be available.4. Turning to our general defensive situation, the weaknesses to which the Chiefs of Staff draw attention, though they might involve some diplomatic disadvantages, would for the most part only involve danger in the event of war with France. France is the only Power that constitutes a threat at one and the same time to our home defence (especially in the air), to our sea-borne communi-cations in the narrow seas and to some extent in the oceans, and to certain of our coast defences at home and abroad. But there are weighty factors which in all circumstances operate as a deterrent to any inclination which France might be assumed to have to go to war with us.   These factors are (a) The age-long experience of the French nation in war and their knownhorror of a war on two flanks. (&amp;) The permanent Teutonic threat to their eastern frontier.(c) The minor threat on their Italian frontier.(d) The complete control of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlanticby the naval forces of Great Britain.There are also important economic deterrents.5. The central feature of the Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff is the question that they have raised about the so-called ten years&apos; rule. In considering this matter it is very desirable to avoid any misunderstanding of what the so-called rule implies. The rule is, as stated above, &quot; that it should be assumed for purposes of framing the Estimates for the Fighting Services that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years.&quot; This formula never ought to be regarded as an essay in prophecy. It is no more than a working hypothesis intended to relieve the Chiefs of Staff from the responsibility of preparing against contingencies which the Government believe to be either remote or beyond the financial capacity of the country to provide against.6. For some years past, and at the present time more than ever, the position and future of this country depend on the recovery and maintenance of sound finances and a healthy trading position. Without these we cannot provide resources for Imperial or national defence. What we need above all is a period of recuperation, diminishing taxes, increased trade and employment. The late war left this country with a public debt of over  7,000 million, a burden disproportionate to that borne by any other country in the world. As a result largely of debt charges (which in 1930-31 absorbed the whole proceeds of the Income Tax and of the Sur-tax, and approximately 45 per cent, of the proceeds of the Death Duties) our national expenditure per head is immensely greater than that of other countries. It is not, therefore, surprising if our people are anxious to avoid heavy expenditure on armaments; and that such is the attitude of the nation is undoubted.7. What has to be considered therefore is one set of risks balanced against the other, and the Treasury submit that at the present time financial risks are greater than any other that we can estimate. They do not desire any more than other Departments that the country should be exposed to any of the dangers which may arise from weakness in our naval, military and air forces, and when the financial and economic condition of the country has improved they will not raise objection to a further review of the provision for the Defence Services. They do, however, submit that to-day financial and economic risks are by far the most serious and urgent that the country has to face and that other risks must, be run, until the country has had time and opportunity to recuperate and our financial situation to improve.Treasury Chambers, March 11, 1932.
