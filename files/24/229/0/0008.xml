[This document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed jor the Cabinet.   March 1932. SECRET. QCP. 108 (32). Copy No...........CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from the-Local Governments in India.S. H.India Office, 22nd March 1932.Government of India.The Muslim situation in Delhi, which was a cause of anxietjr last week, settled down better than was expected aud there has been little trouble during the present, week. The general Muslim situation will depend largely on the Conference now being held at Lahore, but the statemeut issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government yesterday regarding the communal question should have a steadying effect, and should also have favourable political effects of a general character. The broad effect of this week&apos;s reports is to indicate a marked improvement in several directions ; in particular, convictions in some Provinces appear now to be definitely on the downward grade.. The tribal situation is clearing up better than was apprehended. The reactions of trans-frontier activities have been only local in the North-West Frontier Province and have been set off by improvement in other directions.Bombay.The situation in the districts remains generally unchanged, but increased activity is reported from Sholapur, probably owing to the release of agitators. Some telegraph poles and wires were cut in Kanara, where some villages are refusing payment of laud revenue. In Bombay city picketing continued on a reduced scale as last week. The hartal of chemists and druggists was broken on the 13th, and the shops have since remained open. An attempt made on the 18th to reopen the Mulji Jetha cloth market at the instance of the millowners was abandoned by the merchants owing to the hostile but peaceful crowds. Other shops and markets, including the Share Bazaar and Cotton Green, were open from the 14th. Cotton merchants and associations were addressed by Government regarding the boycott and hartals and discussions are in progress. Action under Ordinance 2, excluding figures for Nawabshah district, is as follows ; Section 3, arrests 44, total detained 205 ; section 4, orders issued 149, total in force 902 ; section 21, convictions during week 44. Congress funds, Rs. 307 forfeited under Ordinance 4.Bengal.Improvement continues and the Congress is less active in Midnapore district,, but in Calcutta the number of processions has increased owing to the participation of students. Attempts to hoist the Congress flag over Government buildings and occupy the same continue in some districts. Section 3, arrests 17. Section 4, orders issued 212.   Total in force, 1,935.Madras.There has been some decrease in civil disobedience activity in most districts, but Kistna and Malabar are exceptions. In one village in Kistna additional police have-been quartered for two months at the cost of the villagers. &quot; Buy-Indian &quot; leagues are being formed in some districts. The campaign of misrepresentation in the Press and the spate of interpellation in the Legislative Council continues. The cut motion, on the police budget, which was designed to censure the whole police department, was, however, defeated by CO votes to 30 and the total police demand was passed without a division.United Provinces.There has been very little change in the situation. Boycott and picketing is reported in some districts. The Ahrar party is showing activity in Saharanpur, Aligarh, and Luckuow.   Counter-propaganda continues.   No order has been passed786      60   8.32
under section 3. Eleven orders were issued under section 4 of the Emergency; Powers Ordinance, and six convictions for defying section 4, Emergency Powers-Ordinance, were recorded. The total of convictions during week under the Ordinances was 137 ; under the ordinary law 194.   Total up to date 7,273.   Releases 1,315.North-West Frontier Province.Red Shirt agitation has continued in parts of Peshawar district due to trans-frontier unrest, and the release of a few leaders on appeal, which had an unsettling-effect, and also to propaganda stating that the Ordinances had automatically lapsed after two months. The results have been a revival of picketing- on a small scale and the holding of a number of unauthorised meetings, two of which were on a considerable scale and necessitated the employment of troops as support for the police when arresting leaders. This recrudescence is not at present very serious and is not affecting the situation in other parts of the district. Propaganda by Congress to boycott the election continues, and some interference with voters is possible on polling day in outlying areas. All other districts continue very satisfactory and there have been no attempts in any of them to take advantage of the withdrawal of restrictions under section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure. Interest in the forthcoming election is increasing everywhere. Action taken under the Ordinances has been as follows: Section 3, arrests, nil; total detained, 14. Section 4, orders passed during the week, 264; total orders in force, 1,764. In the trans-frontier area air action against the offending Bajaur tribes was continued until the 14th March, by which date all the lashkars had dispersed and notices of cessation of bombing were issued. The Haji of Turangzai&apos;s son, Badshahgul, who was one of the two chief instigators, has returned home. The other, namely, Alingar Fakir, with the support of Alamzeb, the Nawab of Dir&apos;s renegade brother, has succeeded in raising another Salarzai-Samozai lashkar for an attack on the Nawab&apos;s territory in Jandol. Unless this is countered it may possibly lead to a second revolt of the Dir tribes, who are intriguing with Alamzeb, and, unless lashkars disperse in the next two days, further air action may become necessary.Mohmand.  Strenuous efforts were made throughout the week by Haji Turangzai and other firebrands to raise the upxjer Mohmands.   A contingent, totalling about 400,. collected in Bohaidag, across the presumptive border, but have temporarily dispersed owing to the non-arrival of reinforcements.Punjab.The Punjab is quiet. Trade has somewhat improved. Political arrests under ordinary law, 34 ; under the Ordinances, IS. Totals to date, 359 and 703 respectively. Arrests under section 3 remain at five. Two fresh- orders under section 4 ; total to date, 58.   Total, prosecutions for infractions of such orders, 11.Bihar and Orissa.The Province is quiet with stray cases of picketing. Mendacious leaflets are still being circulated. Ten more orders were issued under section 4, Emergency Powers Ordinance, making a total of 31 in force. There have been no prosecutions for breaches of such orders. Section 3 is not in force. Convictions up to the 12th March total 4,835.Central Provinces.The only event reported is the dispersal with canes of a small crowd at Burhanpur.. The situation is otherwise normal. Prosecutions 142, convictions 131. No extension of Ordinances.Assam.Two satisfactory features are largely attended meetings of Muhammadans in Sylbet to protest against the Civil Disobedience Movement, and an increasing number of releases on apology of youths convicted for picketing and other offences. The situation generally continues to improve.Ajmer Merwara.The general situation is unchanged. There have been five arrests under the ordinary law. Agitation among the tenants of the Istamrary Estates against payment-of dues to Jstimrardars continues.From the Resident, Mysore.No arrests during the week.   The situation in Coorg is quite quiet.
