H.B.9th April,  1952.
INTERNATIONAL    LABOUR   -CONFERENCE-. SIXTEENTH SESSION. Instructions to the Government Delegates.1.    Aholition of Fee Charging Employment Agencies.The Delegates will do their test to ensure that the points on which Governments are to he consulted are sufficiently conprehensive to allow of a full statement of the Government1s policy being made at a later stage in reply to the resulting Questionnaire.        They should avoid as far as possible expressing views on questions of policy during the first discussion.2.    Invalidity, Old Age,  and Widows&apos;  and Orphans&apos;  Insurance,The Delegates will endeavour to secure that the points on which the Governments are to be consulted should be sufficiently comprehensive to allow of a full statement of the system in operation in this country being made in reply to the Questionnaire.3 *    Employment of Children:    Instructions to British Official Delegates.The Delegates will state that His Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom agree substantially as to the nature and extent of the restrictions to which the employment of children in non-industrial occupations should be subjected, but that the method by which it is proposed in the draft Convention to prescribe and enforce the restrictions differs widely from the system which has been in operation for the purpose in the United Kingdom during the last thirty years.The Delegation, while not - objecting to the method proposed in the draft Convention as one possible method, of dealing with the subject, will endeavour to secure amendments in the draft which will in effect cover the British system.       For this
purpose they v/ill propose a compromise which, while providingfor a general prohibition of employment of children under theage of fourteen, would allow exceptions to be made by localauthorities subject to the approval of the Central Government,and without requiring a schedule to be drawn up of the actualoccupations concerned.        This would allow of the retention ofthe present system of regulation by local bye-laws in forcein this country, but would compel local authorities that hadnot yet made bye-laws to make them, ii&apos; they wished employmentbelow the age of fourteen to be allowed in their districts.If a compromise cn these lines is accepted by theConference, as an alternative to the method proposed in thedraft Convention, the Delegates will vote for the Convention,unless, of course, other proposals are inserted in the draftConvention which would not be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.       If any such proposals are included, the delegates should ask for further instructions.4.    Partial Revision of the Convention concerning the Protection against Accidents of Workers Employed in loading or Unloading Ships.The Draft Convention for the prevention of Dock Accidents, adopted at the International Labour Conference in 1929, was based to a large extent on the Regulations in force in this country under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and was supported by H.M. Government.        It was passed, however, under conditions which did not permit of a very close scrutiny of its detailed requirements, and it appeared from conferences which were subsequently held between the Factory Department and the Employers^ and Workers&apos; Associations affected to consider the amendments necessary to bring our law into conformity with the Convention, that there were a few points of serious difficulty which would prevent ratification by this country.       Accordingly H.k&quot;f Government drew up certain
specific proposals ior amendment (the text of which, was communicated to and accepted by the National Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations and the Trades Union Congress General Council) and asked the Governing Body to refer these proposals to the Conference v/ith a view to their inclusion in an amending Convention.       This action was taken in conjunction v/ith the German Government, who also submitted certain specific amendments,  some of which coincided v/ith the British amendments.        On these representations the Governing Body decided to place the question of partial revision of the Convention on the Agenda ior the Conference, and to refer to the Conference the amendments proposed by the British and German Governments,  together v/ith certain amendments submitted Toy one or two other Governments.The Blue Report which has been prepared by the Inter-national Labour Office recommends for adoption all the proposals made by the British Government, and some also of the proposals made by other Governments.       As regards these latter proposals, most of them could be adopted either as they stand or subject to some modification without prejudicing ratification by H.M. Government, but there are one or two which would raise fresh difficulties and should therefore be resisted.It is proposed that the instructions to British Government Delegates should be to sux^port the proposal for an amending Convention, and if an amending Convention embodying the j amendments which are necessary to enable this country to ratify the Convention, and not including any amendments which would prevent such ratification, is submitted to the Conference  I for final adoption,  to vote for such amending Convention. Otherwise the Delegates should abstain from voting.
