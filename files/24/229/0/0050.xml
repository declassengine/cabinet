THIS DOOUlSiNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVErofMEKT.SECRET. COPY HO. CjCP.  150(32). CABINET.Deputation from Railway Unions. Memorandum &quot;by Minister of Transport.On the 7th April last I received, at the request of the Prime Minister, a deputation from the National Union of RaiTwaymen, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association.I attach for the information of the Cabinet a document then handed to me setting out the views of these three Unions on the future organisation of transport in this country.The deputation stated that unemployment was becoming-serious among railwaymen, who hitherto had represented one of the most stable elements in the population and v/ith their dependents accounted for nearly tv/o million people, and that the form, of transport in which they were employed was vital to the nation and was rendered under conditions which guaranteed to the community a high standard of safety and service.     Thejr urged that it was both incumbent upon and possible for a National Government to approach the problem on broad lines and to take effective action.The memorandum suggests that the present organisation is unsatisfactory on the ground that there exists a great deal of wasteful competition betv/een the four railway groups and that there is still an appreciable field for economy in the further standardisation of equipment and the joint purchase of fuel and stores, the avoidance of circuutous routes, the pooling of rolling-stock, and in other directions.     It deals with the relationships betv/een road and rail and repeats arguments that have already been useu by the companies themselves on this question, including the point that tho&quot;heavy cost of providing new roads and remaking old
roads has not, in our-view,  been charged in sufficient measure to that (road transport) industry&quot;.The solution advocated in the memorandum for the difficulties arising from road and rail competition is the formation of a Public Transport Board charged with the operation of railway and road motor undertakings, and clothed with power to acquire and operate inland navigation, coastal steamboat services and air transport.I would draw attention to paragraph 19 of the memorandum. It is there submitted that the existing railway capital should be written down to &quot;approximately its present stock exchange value&quot; on the ground that the companies are &quot;burdened with a lot of capital which never has been remunerative and a lot more which has become permanently unremunerative&quot; and it is suggested that the holders of the converted stock would have a much better security than if the railways remain as at present.      In discussion, I pointed out some of the reasons why such a scheme v/as unlikely to win acceptance, but I undertook, at the request of the deputation, to bring their views&quot;and representations to the attention of the Cabinet.I recommend that I should be authorised to reppy to the effect that the Government have taken note of the views of the Railway Unions and, while not prepared to adopt the particular methods of consolidation of transport on the lines advocated by the deputation, appreciate the importance which the Railway Unions attach to the continued existence of our railways in an efficient and prosperous condition.4-th Hay, 1952.(Intd. )    P.J.P.

JOINT  . GOiMITTES of theNATIONAL UNION OF RAILWAYMEN,  ASSOCIATED SOCIETY OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS &amp; FIREMEN,  AND THE RAILWAY CLERKS 1 ASSOCIATION.MEMORANDU M TO THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT UPON THE QUESTION OF RAILWAY RE-ORGANISATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PUBLIC AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE AND CO-ORDINATE RAILWAY AND ROAD TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS AND OTHER TRANSPORT SERVICES.1.    During the lengthy proceedings before the Railways National Wages Board in the early months of last year (when claims from the Companies for drastic reductions in rates of pay and conditions of employment were under consideration) the three Railway Trade Unions became acquainted more closely than ever with the present unsatisfactory position of the Railway Industry and found themselves unanimously in agreement with the Addendum to the Report which was issued in March, 19p1, b that body.      The Addendum read as follows;-&quot;Whilst concurring in the Findings which provide a measure of assistance for the purpose of enabling the Companies to encounter the immediate difficulties, wevdesire at the same time to state that in our opinion this enquirj&apos;&apos; has clearly revealed the necessity for -other action,  in order that the industry may be in a position to provide the transport facilities desired by industry,  commerce and the travelling puoliCo
&quot;In our view the continuation of four separate Groups of Railways is unsatisfactory.     Modern requirements make further co-ordination imperative,  and the present enquiry has reinforced our opinion that only along the lines of comprehensive national organisation of all forms of transport under public ownership and control can the problems of the transport industry be overcome.&quot;2.    Since that time the difficulties of the railways have continued to increase and we feel more keenly than ever that legislative action on a comprehensive scale is necessary,  not merely in the interests of railways as such, but for the benefit of the whole community.3-    We submit that an efficient railway service is,  and always will be,  a matter of vital necessity.      That form of service is most effective and satisfactory for carrying out the major part of the transport work of the country. Obvious examples are (1) the movement of the enormous numbers of people who have to travel to and from their work day by day,  (2) the conveyance of coal and other heavy merchandise,  and (^) the carrying of both goods and passengers safely on long distances at high speeds.4.    The immense volume of business transacted by the Railway Companies is sufficient proof of the foregoing statement.      It would be physically impossible for the service rendered by the railways to be transferred to road motor vehicles with satisfaction to the trading and travelling public or to the community at large.      Already the overcrowded state of the roads in many places is responsible for a terribly large number of fatal accidents, and we believe it will be generally agreed that it is
34?undesirable that traffic which can be conveyed satisfactorily on the railways (which are enclosed and well provided with safety appliances) should be diverted to the highways.5.    Whilst maintaining that railways are indispensable to the community we are strongly of opinion that their present organisation is uneconomic and unsatisfactory.     The Railways Act of 1 921 v/hich provided for the merging of the many Companies then existing into the present four Groups, viz., London midland &amp; Scottish, London &amp; North Eastern, Great Western, and Gouthern, has proved to be inadequate, and in our view the four Groups ought now to be merged into a single national service under public ownership and control.fo.    Under existing circumstances a great deal of wasteful competition takes place between the Railway Companies with their four centres of direction and administration. This competition results in large volumes of traffic being conveyed by circuitous routes,  involving extra haulage and shunting.      It also causes similar wasteful working of a lot of the separately-owned rolling-stock,  as well as of the 700,000 privately-owned wagons which are still allowed on british railways./.    Our railways are further handicapped by having their policy controlled by large numbers of part-time Directors who are not mainly devoted to the railway service itself, but have several other interests which are usually of greater concern to them.      In our view the service could be unified under public ownership and control and could then be administered and developed much more efficiently by a small Board of full-time Commissioners, chosen for their suitability and experience in railway and transport operations, acting under a Chairman of exceptionally high qualifications.
8.   Apart from the advantages of efficient.single-minded control,  the abolition of costly competition and the simplification of indoor and outdoor working arrangements, -an appreciable measure of economy would result from the standardisation of equipment, in the buying of fuel and stores in greater quantities,  and in the raising of any new capital for future development on better terms than can now be obtained by the existing Railway Companies.9.   Although we consider railways to be indispensable as the principal means of transport we have no desire to disparage the benefit to the community that has resulted from the development of road motor transport.     We recognise that for certain classes of traffic over relatively short distances (or in areas where no railway service is available),  the use of road motor vehicles may be the more expeditious and economical means of transport.      It would obviously be unwise to incur the heavy capital outlay now required for making railway extensions in sparsely populated areas where the limited amount of traffic available can be conveyed satisfactorily by road.10.    A good deal more might be said on behalf of road transport, but in our view it could best be utilised in the public interest by the proposed National Transport Board which would be in a position to decide how public traffic should be allocated, what further improvements in road and rail services respectively should be provided, and how the primary costs ofthese services should be charged.11.    This brings us to the point where we desire to stress the fact that at present road transport does not bear its fair share of the expense involved in its operations. The heavy cost of providing new roads and re-making old roads has not, in our view, been charged in sufficient measure to
3f?that industry.      In the case of the railways their permanent way had to he made and equipped at their own expense after paying a heavy price for every inch of land required. Further, it has to he maintained, guarded and provided with costly safety appliances requiring a large number of men to work them - entirely at the expense of the railway industry.12. In the case of road transport, however, the &quot;permanent way&quot; is provided by the community, and in so far as safety appliances are supplied, or signalling work carried out by the police.y this also is a public charge.      True, some contribution is made towards it byway of license fees for the vehicles of road transport undertakings, but in our opinion that contribution is grossly inadequate, and the cost of the track and signalling services should be borne by those who use the highways,     As the Railway Companies have already emphasised this point in interviews with yourself we need not dwell further upon it except to say that we share their view that the Import duties on petrol cannot fairly be regarded as meeting the difference in the road costs and should only be looked upon in the same light as other Import duties.15. Of course, if both railway and road motor undertaking: v;ere acquired and operated by a Public Transport Authority the difficulty of adjusting costs could be arranged more easily than at present, as also could the equitable fixing of fair rates and charges for the respective services rendered, and the establishment of proper provisions as to hours of duty and rates of pay for road motor workers.     At present a great deal of ruinous undercutting is taking place in regard to freight rates.     Further, it is well known that excessive hours are worked by road motor employees, many of whom labour under &quot;sweated&quot; rates of pay and conditions of employment.
14-. We consider it advisable that the proposed National Transport Authority should also have power to acquire and operate the Inland Navigation services, also Coastal Steamboat services, both of which have their proper place in the transport worlA^     The same may be said of aerial navigation which will no doubt be largely developed in the future.15* v,e are strongly of the opinion that the measures we have advocated would bring harmony and prosperity to the transport industry and would result in the developments which would be of great advantage to the community.16*. Our railway stations (many of which have a good deal of spare land available) could be utilised more largely for public purposes.      For example, the Postal Service in many places could be operated with advantage from tb;e railway station, and the railway telegram and telephone equipment could be made available for public use.     Further, some of the stations might be put to double service by using them as depots for road motor vehicles working in conjunction with the railways.      Again, the electric service of the country might be extended economically by using railway-owned land on the line-sides for laying cables instead of taking them over privately-owned land.17. Then the development of British agriculture could be aided under the Minister for that Department by utilising country railway stations for the grading and packing of produce and as public depots for the storage, on reasonable terms, of seeds, feeding stuffs, and machinery for Agricultural.Co-operative Societies, organised under the aegis of the Department of agriculture.
18. The railways themselves could he improved by the provision of better and brighter stations, especially in London, with wider approaches where necessary. -   Many railway carriages also need re-construction and re-equipment, but under existing circumstances the Companies hesitate to embark upon any improvements, firstly by reason of their recent losses, and secondly because of the high cost of raising new Capital. A Public Authority.with complete control of the whole transport services of the country, with rates and fares fixed upon an economic basis by the Railway Rates Tribunal, could raise new Capital on the best possible terms.19. wO far as existing railway Capital is concerned, this should,  in our view, be written down to approximately its present stock Exchange value.     The Companies are now burdened with a lot of capital which never has been remunerative and a lot more which has become permanently unremunerative in recent years.     This accounts for the shrinkage in ^tock Exchange quotations and it would obviously be unfair for such liabilities to be taken over by a Public Authority.     ..t the same time we may point out that the holders of the converted Stock would in future have a much better security than is ever likely to be the case if the railways remain as at present under Company ownership and control.20. In conclusion we would stress the point that transport is naturally a public service, its distinctive characteristic being that everything and everybody depends upon it.     In our view it ought, therefore, to be brought under public ownership and control by a National Transport Board.
