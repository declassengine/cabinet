The High Commissioners latest advice is similar to that contained in his letter annexed to CP, 124 (32);    Sir A. Wauchope is definitely of the opinion that it would be impossible to devise any form of Legislative Council at the present time which would be accept-able to both Jews and Arabs, and that the best course would be to defer action in the hope of obtaining agreement on a form of Council, for a further period of say - li- years.8IR9RMMfMMM4n
4, The Committee make the following rwcoiamendationsto the Cabinet --(a) That the action proposed by the high Commissioner, namely, the second alternative in paragraph 5,. should be approved5(b) that there should, if possible, he no Government pronouncement at the present\jn time in this country as regards theestablishment of a Legislative Council;(o) that the High Commissioner should beallowed to use his discretion in the manner of carrying out the policy approved;    he should, however, avoid, if possible, raising the Issue of the Legislative Council at the present time;    but should, if satisfactory progress were made in the meantime on the lines proposed by the High Commissioner, prepare a statement suitable for oomrnunica-tion to the permanent Mandates Cooimission in the Autumn of 1932.-,5o The following Is the High Commissioners statementof the courses open to him;-&quot;The first Is to say that, in order to redeem our pledges,  trie Government has decided on the establishment of a Legislative Council, and is willing to discuss with representative&apos;men the form which that Legislative Council should, take, but that no opposition will deter the Government from forming a Legislative Council, partly by-election, but, if necessary, by nomination,,The second alternative is for me to say quietly to the leaders to whom I have spoken that the Government has given a pledge, and is determined to redeem it.    But, before forming a Legislative Council, we consider that it is advisable to do three things for the good of the country and for the training of responsible people in responsible work ; -(1) Continue and extend our policy of giving Administrative -scrk to Palestinians&apos; by appointing both Arabs and Jews to such Councils as the Agricultural Council;(8) Establish Local Councils and new Municipal bodies throughoi.it the country, probably in 1938 s(3) Appoint some Palestinian Members to the Advisory Coimci 1, in 1932 sIn furtherance of (I)- I have already appointed unofficial members to the Road Board, and shall, make similar appointments to  the Standing Committee for Commerce and Industry and the Railway Board, in the hear future,, end I am considering further possibilities in the same direction^&quot;
(&amp;)  that in communicating the Government? s decision, the Secretary of State should put it on reoordjfor Sir Ae Wauchope&apos;s own information, that the Government favour tlie establishment  of a Legislative Council as soon as the conditions permitsSigned on behalf of the Committee^ Pc CUNLIFFE-LISTER,CHAIRMAN,2, Whitehall Gardens, S*W,1.13th April, 1932,

PARAPHRASE telegram from the Seo-re-tary of State for t he&quot;Colonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine.(Sent 6 p.m. 6th April, 1932).IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal.Policy of immigration set out in memorandum was today approved by Cabinet and Cabinet Committee was appointed to consider Legislative Council.      Cabinet had your letter of 23rd March before them together with comment thereon from me to following effect -&quot;I accept &quot;Wauchope&apos;s estimate of effect on Arabs of making new offer of Council but declining to proceed in default of agreement.      I cannot advise forcing on Jews legislature to which they would be opposed and&quot;which I do not believe would work satisfactorily.    I, therefore, advise adoption of Wauchope&apos;s second alternative.    But we must face fact that proposal means definitely going back for present on statements in Whits paper and to Permanent Mandates Commission11.Cabinet are naturally impressed with difficulty of going back on successive undertakings to establish a Council and are anxious fully to explore possibility of any form of Council which would be acceptable to Jews and Arabs. Is it possible in your opinion to devise Council,  either with or without unofficial majority, which would be accept-able at the present time to both Jews and Arabs.I shall be glad if you will telegraph fully your views.      Cabinet Committee meets Tuesday morning.
2 2 2hi H hiPARAPHRASE telegram from the High Commissioner ffer Palestine to the Secretary/&quot; of State for the Colonies.Dated nth April,   1932., (Received Colonial Office 5.50 p,m.    Sth April-,  1932).D,iMEDIATE.Private and Personal.    Legislative Council.       Your telegram fith April.    It is my opinion that it is not possible to devise any form of Legislative Council which would he accepted at present time by both Arabs and Jews.    Nothing short of numerical equality of Jewish and Arab members would be acceptable to Jews.      This would be wholly unacceptable to Arabs and I consider wrong in principle.    Put I hope that both sides will be rsore reasonab3.e in say one year or eighteen months and that agreement on a form of Council will then be possible.    I have made some progress in that direc-tion but njt enough.    Further time is required,:We have already allowed one and a half years to pass since the issue of White Paper without setting up. Legislative Council.    I suggest that it is legitimate as well as expedient to wait another one and a half years in order to obtain agreement before action.Establishment of a Legislative Council may bo examined from three aspects;    (i)  as an honourable pledge (ii) the good of the people (ill) the effect of fulfilment or withholding the establishment of a Legislative Council on pe-apie,,These three? are obviously intimately connected.(1) and (2).    The pledge was given and must be fulfilled.    I feel that if for good of people we delay the carrying out of the actual wording of the pledge to a ds^ts more favourable to its fulfilment such a course is not
9 9 9dishonourable.    The spirit of our pledge (though unfortunately not wording) is to enlarge powers of people in self government.Tliis should be done with least possible delay in three ways set out in my letter of 23rd March.Not only towns but village communities will be affected by the new local government Actc    It will not at once add to efficiency of administration;    it will even-tually add    to capacity for self government and immediately to feeling that we recognise local communities should guide local affairs.I hope to be able shortly to increase participa-tion of people in administration of their own affairs by-arranging for elections Moslem Supreme Council to be held in place of present system of nomination.      I foresee not only goodpractical result but also a factor in establishing good feeling between this Government and Moslems if this is carried through.(3),    I cannot foretell how seriouo the results might be of suggesting officially that we are ready to establish a Legislative Council now and then shelving pro-posals in deference to Jewish protests.     We should transmute the latent mistrust of Arab community to active distrust and further refusal to co-operate with Government.    I am slowly building up between leading Arabs and myself a certain feeling of trust.    That would vanish and feeling that Government is swayed by Jewish influence and not by Arab rights would not be eradicated for very long (group omitted)0The enforcement of a Legislative Council on the country    against the wishes of Jewish community vi/ould create very difficult situation here, would not be for good of
country and would causo a great cutcry throughout diaspora.I have been told by men of independent Zionir.tr. ouch as much trusted Mayor of Tel-Aviv and Victor Konn the able and (corrupt group) Director of p. Itt c. A.  an well as Arlosoroff that 90% of Jevws would refuse to co-operate at present in any form of Legislative Council we could possibly offer.But it has been suggested to me by Arloscroff and others independently that in the future I should discuss with Jewish leaders what powers and what form a Jewish Council should take.    I shall do this when their at present unreasonable demands sitch ar, that Jow and Arab must be equally represented on any Legislative Council may hay^ been modified by time.A formal announcement now that no Legislative Council will be formed for some years would give rise to a great increase of resentment and mistrust,  and I do not recommend it.    But if we proceed an I advocate in second alternative in my letter of 33rd March and you approve of three oourner. recommended above I foresee no active resentment and no increase of mistrust of our honesty of purpose but only a certain amount  of clamour in pre,&quot;.s and a oertai^ disappointment at our inaction by Arab leaders.1 am perfectly prepared to face and perfectly prepared to deal with any situation that may arise from postponement of formation of a Legislative Council, if you decide to adopt my second alternative.
9 Q i7M W t)TELEGRAM -from the- High, Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,      9th April,  1932.IMMEDIATE.private and Personal.My Private and Personal telegram of April 8th.    I feave learnt from my private conversations that the Jews&apos; objection to any Legislative Council is due to belief that the Arab &quot;leaders chiefly desire a Legislative Council in order to cheek the advancement of a National ^one for the Jews,-,    They are not altogether incorrect in this belief. Jews at present think that the Government are unwilling and unable to devise a means whereby an Arab majority in a Legislative Council would not by indirect means delay or hinder the advancement of a National Home.    Apart from the above Arab Leaders wish for a Legislative Council not so much for the public good as in order to serve their own party needs. Party feeling is at present extremely bitter.The Fellaheen are so much concerned over their increased crop failures and indebtedness that they are not interested in any ideas of a Legislative Council.
