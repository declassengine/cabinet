9 9 n. a b \JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVEgHMBHT.COPY NO. ?CABINET.Use of Private Car for Carrying Goods, Payne v. Allcoek - Judgment in Divisional Court.Note by the Minister of Transport.A situation of some embarrassment has arisen out of a Judgment on the 21st April, 19J2,  in the Kings Bench DivisioncThe Lord Chief Justice and Mr.Justice Avory (Mr.Justice Macnaghten dissenting) gave a Judgment to the effect that under Section 1A of the Finance Act, 1922, the occasional use of a private motor car for carrying goods rendered the owner liable to pay duty at the rate provided for goods vehicles in any case where the duty as a goods vehicle would be higher than the duty chargeable on the horse power basis for a private car.The view held by my legal advisers has always coincided with that expressed by Mr.Justice Macnaghten in his dissenting Judgment,  i.e,  that to bring a private car into the goods vehicle class it is necessary not only that the car should be used for the conveyance of goods or luggage, but that it should also be -specially constructed or adapted for that purpose.The Judgment of the Divisional Court, however, is binding and there is no appeal to any higher Court.      The effect would be to render all the lighter types of private cars,  if used occasionally for the conveyance of luggage or goods of some kind, liable to the rate of duty applicable to the lighter types of goods vehicle, he,  10,  15 or  20 according to the unladen weight.      This is a position that clearly.cannot be allowed to continue and I am consulting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the steps which might be taken by means of a suitable clause in the Finance Bill to make clear the point beyond any possibility of doubt.
2 5rd April, 1932.- 2 -In the meantine I have ceused a circular to he sent to the licensing authorities requesting them to maintain their existing practice pending further consideration of the matter.(Intld. )     P.J.P.
