THIS document IS the property of HIS britannic MAJESTVS government     1 t) htPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1932.SECRET. Copy No.    &apos;9COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 25oth Meeting, held on March 22, 1932.******(4.)-IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.    ANNUAL REVIEW&quot; FOR  1932 BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.(C.I.D. Papers No. 1082-B* and No. 1087-B.t) (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 253rd Meeting, Minute 5.)The Committee of Imperial Defence had under consideration the Annual Review for 1932 by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B*), and a Note by the Treasury (OLD. Paper No. 1087-Bt).THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to paragraph 40 of the Review which contained three definite recommendations, the first being to the effect that the assumption governing the estimates of the Defence Services that from any given date there will be no major war for ten years, should be cancelled. He suggested that this was a question which must be faced by the Committee, and he drew attention to the Note by the Treasury (OLD. Paper No. 1087-B) commenting on the recommendation by the Chiefs of Staff. He added that both papers would come before the Cabinet at their meeting the next day.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that the comments of the Treasury on the Annual Review were contained in OLD. Paper No. 1087-B, but that paragraph 5, dealing with the &quot;ten years&quot; assumption, was not intended in any way to challenge the Chiefs of Staffs recommendations.SIR JOHN SIMON remarked that the question was one requiring great thought and study, but the general view of the Foreign Office, which they reached with regret, was that the ten-year assumption was a dangerous one.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART, to whom Sir John Simon had turned, supported this view.SIR BOLTON EYRES-MONSELL said he thought it was hardly fair on those Ministers who were responsible to Parliament for the Defence Services to have to work on the ten-year assumption. He quite understood the necessity for the original assumption that preparations need not be made for a war within the next ten years, but it was impossible to allow the assumption to continue indefinitely from day to day. He thought that the country would be horrified if it found that this ten-year rule continued to be the basis of our defence preparations.LORD HAILSHAM agreed that in existing circumstances it was impossible to continue working on the ten-year assumption.* Circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 104 (32) t Circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 105 (32).[6763-1]
THE PRIME MINISTER said with regret that this appeared to be the general view. He suggested that the right course for the Committee of Imperial Defence was to accept in principle the Chiefs of Staffs recommendations in paragraph 40 of their Review, and to report them to the Cabinet, who would consider them on the understanding that the matter cannot be allowed to drift.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (1) To accept the following conclusions contained in paragraph 40 of the Chiefs of Staff Annual Review for 1932 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1082-B) :-&quot; (a) That the assumption governing the Estimates of the Defence Services, that from any given date there will be no major war for ten years, should be cancelled.(b) That a start should be made in providing for commitments which are purely defensive, including the defence of bases. First priority should be given to requirements in the Far East, on which we are submitting a separate report.(c) That a decision should not be delayed until the results of the Disarmament Conference are known. Recent events in the Far East are ominous.   We cannot ignore the Writing on the Wall.&quot;(2) That the Annual Review, together with the above Minute, should be referred for the consideration of the Cabinet.* .* * * * *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 22, 1932.
