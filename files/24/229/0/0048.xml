H.3rd May 1932.0 QNote on the Policy of the Terrorist Parties in Bengal.Introductory. It has already been recorded in the printed report on the activities of terrorists in Bengal during 1930 that both the Jugantar party and the Dacca Anushilan Samiti expected the civil disobedience movement to bring about in the Province a state of unrest which would be favourable to the launching of terrorism. The Dacca Anushilan Samiti&apos;s plan was more ambitious than that of the Jugantar party, for it aimed at an all-India rising, whereas the Jugantar party with a clearer understanding of the immediate possibilities were content with an all-Bengal rising.The Chittagong raid was undertaken in April 1930 by the Chittagong Jugantar party independent of, and without consultation with, the other Jugantar groups and was not, therefore, part of the main Jugantar party&apos;s conspiracy. This raid, the first of its kind, was very nearly successful It is necessary to realise that had it been successful the raiders would have proceeded to seize the treasury, open the jail gates, set up their headquarters in the cutchery, enrol the student community under their banner, and publicly punish the Indian and execute all the European officials. Other barbarities, not mentioned by the raiders who gave the foregoing description of their intentions, would undoubtedly have been committed. The Ordinance which was immediately promulgated was applied against those parties which were known at that time to be planning similar demonstrations, with the result that the leaders and more important members of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti and also of the powerful composite group under Niranjan Sen Gupta, whose plans for district risings had been exposed in the Mechuabazar Street bomb case, were arrested. At that time the leaders of the main Jugantar party were hatching their plot, but had guarded their secret so -carefully that the police learned very little about it. The powers then possessed by Government were limited, for proof not only of membership of a terrorist party, but also of the commission or intended commission of certain scheduled offences was necessary before any terrorist could be dealt with under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act. This is why the leaders and members of the other Jugantar groups were not arrested after the Chittagong raid.As far as the Dacca Anushilan Samiti and Niranjan Sen Gupta&apos;s party were concerned, the arrests and internments prevented the fruition of the plots for district see Report c risings. The Jugantar party&apos;s campaign was originally timed for June, but was&apos; postponed because sufficient arms had not been procured. The Dacca party, however, gave effect to part of the programme, namely, the cutting of telegraph wires. The real campaign opened in August 1930 with the bomb attack on Sir Charles Tegart in Calcutta, which was followed by two other bomb outrages in Calcutta and the murder of Mr. Lowman in Dacca. The attack on Sir Charles Tegart was to have been the signal for bomb and pistol attacks on Europeans, official and non-official, and raids on district headquarters after the pattern of the Chittagong raid. The arrest of Dr. Narain Ray and others in connection with the Bomb Conspiracy case and the internment of many other leaders and important members of the Jugantar party all over the Province prevented the Jugantar party&apos;s campaign attaining the dimensions hoped for by Manoranjun Gupta, the dictator of the^party&apos;s policy, but did noton attempts to smuggle arms into Bengal.prevent the long series of outrages which foil owed/ 866     60  5.32These outrages included the
murder of Inspector Tarirxi Miikharji at Chandpur, Colonel Simpson in Writers&apos; Buildings, Mr. Peddie in Midnapore, Mr. Garlick in Alipore, Khan Bahadur Ahsanulla in Chittagong, Mr. Stevens in Comilla, and Babu Asliutosh Neogi in Calcutta, the attempts to murder Messrs. Nelson and Townend in Writers&apos; Buildings, Assistant Sub-Inspector Sasanka Mohan Bhattacharji in Chittagong, Mr. Cussells at Tangail, Mr. Durno at Dacca, and Mr. &quot;Villiers in Calcutta, and numerous armed robberies and dacoities.At the end of October 1931 Ordinance No. IX was promulgated, by which the Government were empowered to intern any person .proved to be a member of a terrorist party. No immediate improvement in the situation took place, for since then occurred the murders of Mr. Stevens in Comilla and Babu Ashutosh Neogi in Calcutta and further armed robberies and dacoities.The spate of outrages will not be checked until the absconders are arrested, for they are murderous fanatics whose fanaticism increases after every successful outrage -and is maintained by the unchecked stream of praise of assassins and other terrorists in the Congress press and platform. By absconders are meant, not only persons wanted for specific offences, but also persons who are evading arrest under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act or have elected to go into hiding in order the better to continue their terrorist conspiracies. They infect other terrorists and potential terrorists with their own fanaticism and commit or cause to be committed further outrages, the perpetrators of which, if not arrested on the spot, lie in wait for the next opportunity to commit some other foul crime. Two striking examples of this -may be mentioned, the absconders of the Chittagong Armoury raid of April 1930 -and the absconders of the Munshiganj (Dacca) wire-cutting case of June 1930.The Ghittagong absconders, the leaders among whom fear capital punishment should they be arrested, were responsible for the murder of Inspector T. C. Mukharji at Chandpur in December 1930 and the murder of Khan Bahadur Ahsanulla, Inspector of Police, Chittagong, in August 1931. They have succeeded in organising -a powerful party in Chittagong which has been kept in some sort of check only by special precautions taken in that district, but they are now more desperate than ever owing to the drive that is at present being conducted for their capture.Members of the Dacca Sri Sangha were absconders of the Munshiganj wire-cutting case. Binoy Bose, after murdering Mr. Lowman and shooting Mr. Hodson in Dacca in August 1930, absconded with two others of the same group, one of whom was an -absconder in the wire-cutting case, and murdered Colonel Simpson and shot Messrs. Townend and Nelson in Writers&apos; Buildings in December 1930. Dinesh Gupta, one -of these murderers, while in hiding, organised a group in Midnapore which included Bimal Das Gupta, who shot Mr. Peddie in March 1931. Other absconders of the Dacca Sri Sangha were busy organising further outrages and sent the youth, as yet unknown, to shoot Mr. Garlick in Alipore in July, and organised the attack on .Mr. Durno in Dacca and Mr. Villiers in Calcutta iu October. Bimal Das Gupta, who had murdered Mr. Peddie, was the person who attempted to murder Mr. Villiers. It is probable that Babu Ashutosh Neogi, the witness in the Maniktola dacoity case, who was shot dead on the 30th December 1931, was murdered by or through the instrumentality of Subodh Mitra, an absconder in that case.The most important work of the Intelligence Branch at present is, therefore, to -effect the capture of the absconders. The powers conferred by Ordinance IX, however, are being used against all active terrorist groups, for steady and unrelenting pressure is necessary on them in order to rob the absconders of the recruits they would otherwise obtain, and to prevent the groups organising the commission of crime.The policy of the terrorist groups at the beginning of. 1930 has already been sketched at the beginning of this note. At the present time, when most of the experienced leaders of all terrorist groups have been either interned or sentenced in specific cases, there are two aspects of the terrorists&apos; policy to be considered, namely, the policy being pursued by the active terrorists still at large and that proposed by the leaders in jail. The following is an attempt to describe in brief the policy of each of the three main parties in both aspects.2. Policy of Jugantar party;-The Jugantar party- has proved itself to be the most dangerous party in Bengal. Its record of achievement the Ghittagong raids, almost all the murders and many armed robberies and dacoities Is one which must in the future draw to it adherents&apos; in large numbers from all over Bengal. It also has the advantage over other terrorist parties of being&apos; the lighting lorce of ..Subhas
9 O 1ci eJ -i.on the alliance between Con-gress and Terrorism in Bengal.Chandra Bose, who is more outspoken than any other Congress leader of Bengal in praise of terrorists and in his demand for complete independence, which is the See Note B avowed object of the terrorist campaign.   This advantage is great, for it opens out avenues of employment for terrorists in all institutions controlled by the Congress party and vast opportunities of recruitment.At the present, time the most dangerous of the Jugantar parties are at Chittagong, where the absconders of the Raid case are plotting further outrages, and at Dacca, Calcutta, and Tippera, where the groups of the Sri Sangha, the party responsible for so many assassinations and other crimes, are in considerable strength under the guidance of fanatical absconders. The policy of these two groups of the Jugantar party is to paralyse the administration by the murder of European officials, selected Indian officials, and selected non-official Europeans. They have given effect to this policy ever since 1930, when the chances of successful risings on a large scale in several districts simultaneously faded into remoteness. The latest information received of their plans is that the Chittagong absconders intend to escape to Calcutta, and in addition to organising murders, bring about district risings in collaboration with other Jugantar groups and a section of the Dacca Anushilan Revolted Group. In spite of the many internments under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and convictions for specific offences, there still remain groups, of the Jugantar party in most districts, and although all have been severely shaken by the police campaign, they are still dangerous in those districts where they were particularly well organised.In most districts during 1931. the Jugantar groups have been speaking of organising district risings.   Such risings, however, require months of quiet preparation and a well-organised body of local terrorists.   A period of intense police activity at a time when most of the experienced district leaders and many of the rank and file have already been arrested is not, therefore, conducive to the success of such schemes. The result is that the groups have to be satisfied with stray murders and the commission of dacoity with the object of securing money for the purchase of arms and reorganisation, but the idea of an eventual rising is always in the background. The probable failure of the Round Table Conference was often discussed by the terrorists, who expected that Gandhi would then declare civil disobedience again.   In this they saw increased possibilities of terrorism.    In 1930 the Jugantar leaders planned to launch their attack at a time when the country was disturbed by the lawlessness of the non-co-operation movement.   The ready response to the recruiting agent and the success of their campaign prove that their selection of the right moment was not at fault.   It was suggested that in 1932, if civil disobedience were declared, the Jugantar party should carry on with terrorism at the same time as the Congress waged a &quot; non-violent &quot; war.    Subhas Chandra Bose, however, is said to have stated that the terrorists should give civil disobedience a chance and resume terrorism only if civil disobedience failed.    Subhas Chandra Bose is the last man to object to Europeans being murdered, and his desire to suspend terrorism during the civil disobedience movement was probably merely in order that the Congress under the garb of non-violence and the shelter of the Gandhi-Irwin pact might stir up the people and thus prepare the ground once more for the terrorists.   Subhas Chandra. Bose&apos;s attitude at the recent Berhampore Congress is instructive.   He clearly intended to force Gandhi&apos;s hand over the Bengal Ordinances and compel him to start civil disobedience.   Subhas Chandra Bose got his resolution passed largely through the support of a communist-cum-terrorist group known as the Samyaraj party.   This-party, the leaders of which are persons who were at one time members of some terrorist group, aims at bringing about a mass revolution in which all terrorist groups and the communists will combine.   Satindra Nath Sen Gupta is stated to have said in. November that terrorism should continue in order that the revolutionary spirit might he maintained, and that mass action would be possible when civil disobedience were, declared.   Governments attitude towards civil disobedience is now clear.   Subhas Chandra Bose has not been given the opportunity to work out his schemes, and the Jugantar party will carry on with its campaign of murder and dacoity as undoubtedly it would have done anyhow, for it is beyond the control of any Congress leader.Policy and activity of Jugantar leaders in internment. The leaders of the-Jugantar party in the Buxa internment camp exerted a baneful influence over the members of their, party still at large. During 1931 they sent out instructions that murders of Europeans were to continue, thus playing no small part in the terrible crimes that.were committed. On occasions these instructions have been sent out in order to avenge executions of assassins, on - others in order that Government may be
compelled to yield to the Congress claims at the Ronnd Table Conference. In October there was even a proposal that some of. them should abscond from the camp and murder certain selected European officers. They felt it very bitterly that Gandhi did not make their release a condition of the pact, and in November, after J. M. Sen Gupta visited them in order to ascertain their views on the subject of a compromise with Government and they learnt that this move had failed, they were determined more than ever that terrorism in Bengal should never stop. No information has been received at any time that they have counselled their followers to cry a halt, such as leaders have usually done when removed themselves from the scene of action in previous campaigns. They have kindled the enthusiasm of the other detenus of their party in the camp and are determined to resume terrorism as soon as they are released. This will take the form of simultaneous risings in several districts and the detenus were being instructed in the parts they would be expected to play. They tried to win over the detenus of the other parties to a proposal of amalgamation: but the old rivalry appears to have been too strong. The removal of the principal leaders to jails outside the Province will, it is hoped, prevent their playing an active part in the terrorist -conspiracy, but it cannot be expected to reform them.Reference has been made to a visit paid by Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta to the leaders interned in the Buxa camp. In October 1931 an agent reported what had transpired during this interview. He stated that Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta suggested that, if they guaranteed not to push on schemes of violence, to control the young members inside and outside jail, and to prevent them from committing further violence, he might succeed in getting the detenus released. Most of the leaders of the Jugantar party .and the Dacca Anushilan Samiti laughed the suggestion to scorn and said that it -amounted to the selling of their birthright by an ignominious compromise. Two of the Jugantar party leaders, however, told him that, provided the British Government accepted the Congress claims, they were prepared to undertake to control the young men and not to encourage them to commit violence.The determination of the accused in the Cluttagong Armoury case to adhere to terrorism as their policy is well proved in a letter to Mr. Gandhi which was drafted in March 1931 by one of the principal accused in the case. The letter contains the following passages: &quot; The terms of truce have been sisserted at ,the cost of sacrifice on our part and true to say at the cost of natioual prestige. . . .   The amouot of blood we Indians shed, the amount of trouble we undertook to get the Government oornered have been totally neglected by the Working Committee, and the whole position and strategic gains obtained during the fight have been blasted up at a moment. ...   I am a member of that school of fighters who have taken the vow of liberating the motherland through violent means. . . .   We are common human beings ; we are not Christs or Ohaitanyas and we know that murder of oppressors only can give our motherland a bit of relief. . . .   Disobedience of law in the civil form, however forceful or virulent it may be, can never unnerve the enemy unless and until the same turns up to be criminal.   Hence the widespread and indiscriminate murder of Europeans is the only panacea for the vital malady which is eating away the very vitality of our nation every day. . . .   Tou know full well the philosophy or doctrine we follow.   Be it as it may, from the very advent of civil disobedience . movement some of the revolutionaries wanted to give your movement and theories a chance, and hence your disobedience campaigu has attained the auouut of success which we can now see. Tou can certainly not deny the fact that in almost all the provinces the Congress programme has been worked out by the men, most of whom have got violence as their policy in heart, and rspecially in Bengal, where the disobedience campaign has achieved the highest amount of success, ninety per cent, of the Congress workers are open revolutionaries to whom no doubt all the credit of the success goes. . . .   Your saintly conscience and unprejudiced mind did not care to utter .a single word in favour of those who cared not to spare even the last drop of their blood for the deliverance of their so dear motherland. . . .   But if the matter was to have been decided in this way without an atom of gain for us, why then have you cried halt to the working ofour own programme?   Our lives are hanging on threads . . . thousands of us are rotting in prisons . . . but to our utter surprise our cases have not even been mentioned once during the negotiations. We are to die and rot in prisons as was the case before.   Why then shall we stop our own proper fight which and which alone can bring us real freedom which no amount of civil disobedience or &quot;boycott even continued for centuries will bring?   We can only stop our own fight and other -violent programmes, and are also ready to work out your programme which will no doubt carry much weight, if our prisoners who have been convicted of violent offences are at once released and all the dearh sentences commuted and the persons set at liberty and lastly all such trials withdrawn and the persons let oft without delay.   We entreat you earnestly to see the Viceroy again and to bring pressure upon him to ratify our demands, otherwise we have our own course and you along -with your Working Committee have your own course; we run together for the  same  goal without having any obligations or responsibility to each other.&quot;Sufficient has been said to indicate that the Jugaritar party is determined to -continue its murderous activities. It has a large supply of arms, many fanatics to use them, and also many of the loaded bombs which were&apos; distributed in 1930.
A sinister development of the Jugantar party&apos;s policy is the formation of groups of&apos; female terrorists. In previous campaigns there were women who acted as custodians .of arms and harbourers of absconders, but they were usually relatives of terrorists, and were, as far as is known, lew iu number. Women of the bhadralok class played but a small active part in political agitation until recently. Nevertheless it would be idle to suppose that they have not been contaminated by the atmosphere of anti-British hatred which has been sedulously worked up by the Congress and the terrorists for so many years. During the last civil disobedience campaign the Congress formed Women&apos;s Committees for picketing and other Congress activities, and Bengali women and girls in large numbers became as keen agitators as the men. In their case, as in the case of the men, the step from the &quot;non-violent&quot; activities of the Congress to the violent activities of the terrorist proved to be a very short one. The terrorist recruiter, particularly of the Jugantar party, became busy amongst them and succeeded so well that in 1931 a woman actually took part in a dacoity in Calcutta and two schoolgirls murdered the District Magistrate in Comilla.3. Policy of Dacca Anushilan Samiti. At the beginning of 1930 the policy of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti was to organise an insurrection on an all-India scale. By March, however, the civil disobedience movement had brought about a state of unrest in the Province favourable to terrorism, and plans were made for risings in several -districts. After the Chittagong raid the leaders of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti who had made these plans and the members who were known to be about to carry them out were interned under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act. The control of the Samiti then passed to leaders who believed that the time had not come for terrorism. The rank and file were naturally excited by the achievements of the -Jugantar party and eager to play their part in active terrorism. They revolted against their leaders and formed groups with immediate violence as their object. The leaders&apos; -attempt to control them failed, and ever since 1930 there has been a steady flow of recruits from the Samiti to the Anushilan Revolted Groups.It must not be understood from their attitude that the leaders of the Dacca Anu-shilan Samiti are averse to terrorism, for this is far from being the case. They Avant to organise risings on a big scale and know by experience that dacoities and stray murders only result in the smashing up of a terrorist organisation before such plans can mature.During 1931 the leaders of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti were at their wits&apos; end to devise some method of preventing the wholesale defection of members from the Samiti. In January they said they would organise risings in Bengal and collect arms for this purpose. In August they said that a widespread insurrection would be organised to take place in two or three or five years&apos; time, irrespective1 of any settlement between Government and the Congress. In this insurrection the masses would take part and a special feature would be the participation in it of the Volunteer Corps (the Hindus-than Seva Dal). In the same month also it was decided that permission should be given to the commission of dacoity in order to prevent the young members from going beyond their control. In September they agreed to join the Chittagong Jugantar party in a conspiracy to murder local officials to avenge the incidents following Khan Bahadur Ahsanulla&apos;s murder, but immediately changed their minds for fear of being arrested. In October Ashu Kahili, one of the leaders, stated that the Samiti would organise an efficient army, by which he evidently meant the Hindusthan Seva Dal, for an insurrection in three or four years&apos; time, and would meanwhile do nothing either to obstruct or to help the commission of outrages, for, he said, it was difficult to keep the young men in check. It was also reported that the Samiti would adopt a violent policy as soon as the Round Table Conference failed.. In November a report was received that the Dacca Anushilan Sannti leaders wanted to strengthen their orgauisa-tion and train members for the coming insurrection and were abstaining from terrorism in order that Government might not arrest them.A noteworthy point in this policy is that the insurrection is timed to take place when the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act is expected to expire. In 1925 the Jngantar party&apos;s policy was the same, and thanks to the release of the leaders and the period of organisation afforded them during the last two years of the currency of the Act, they were able to carry it out. .Policy and activity of leaders in internment. The leaders of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti who were interned in the Buxa camp are those, it must be&apos; remembered, who had planned district risings in 1930. In March 1931 they were despondent over their failure and admitted their foolishness in framing such an ambitious programme.
Cf. Report C on Arms Smuggling.They declared that as soon as they were released they would launch a campaign of violence and prove that the Dacca Anushilan Samiti is capable of surpassing the achievements of the Jugantar party. In April, May, and June they sent out instructions to members of the,party still at large that dacoities were to he committed and that officers and agents of the secret police were to be murdered in order to keep up the spirits of the young members. In September they again sent out instructions that such crimes should be committed on the failure of the Round Table Conference. In October they sent word to Ashu Kahili that the Dacca Anushilan Samiti should commit outrages and that detenus in village and home internment should abscond in order to take part in them. It is significant that after this information was received a member of the Samiti did abscond while on the way from Bnxa camp to village-internment.In the camp they tried hard to win back the members of the Revolted Groups and succeeded to some extent. They set before them a scheme which comprised the capture of all open organisations such as the Congress and Students&apos; Associations, which they would run on socialistic principles, and the control of the party by an. Executive Board consisting of seven members, four from the orthodox party and three from the Revolted Groups. The secret group would make preparations for an insurrection in which the masses would take part, immediately the leaders were released. In October it was learnt that the negotiations with the members of the-Revolted Group were successful and that the Central Board had already been formed.There can be no doubt that these leaders and their followers intend to resume their terrorist activities as soon as they are released. It seems that they have realised the impracticability of an all-India insurrection scheme and will be content with an insurrection in Bengal. They will have no difficulty in wresting the leadership of the Samiti from the hands of the present leaders and, having declared their fighting policy, in reasserting their authority over most at any rate of the members of the party, who are now members of the Revolted Groups. The Samiti has already a large stock of firearms which it will strive to supplement for its future needs.The possibility of their attempting to organise an all-India rising, however, cannot be disregarded, for changes of policy are frequently promised merely for the sake of expediency. The connection between the Dacca Anushilan Samiti and terrorists of other provinces, especially the Punjab and the United Provinces, which is interrupted at present by the internment of the leaders, will be resumed as soon as the latter are-released.4. Policy of Dacca Anushilan Revolted Group. The terrorist group known as the Dacca Anushiian Revolted Group consists of the parties which joined the party formed by Niranjan Sen Gupta, Satish Pakrashi, and Binayendra Ray Chaudhuri, in 1929 with a programme of immediate terrorism and still do not acknowledge the leaders of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti and those groups of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti which have broken away from their leaders since that time. In 1VJ2S Niranjan Sen Gupta, who studied Dan Breen&apos;sbook on the Irish Rebellion, was making preparations for attacks on district headquarters in Bengal, but the searches and arrests which led to the institution of the Mechuabazar Street bomb case and internments after the^ Chittagong raid in April 1930 prevented the group from carrying these plans into effect.The example&apos; set by the Chittagong Jugantar party inspired the members of the Dacca Anushilan Revolted Group with enthusiasm which increased with the further successes of the main Jugantar party under Manoranjan Gupta. The members of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti were infected with the same enthusiasm and flocked under leaders who were for immediate terrorism, leaving their old leaders with a greatly reduced following. During 1931 the groups of. this party in various districts com-mitted armed robberies and dacoities and succeeded in amassing a large sum of money for the purchase of arms which would be required eventually for district risings, and attacks on armouries, treasuries, and police-stations. Of the crimes committed by this party in 1931, the Atharabari train dacoity in Mymensingh in April was the most dastardly, for the culprits shot dead two persons. These successes naturally inspired the members with added enthusiasm and made it impossible for the Dacca Anushiian Samiti leaders to win back their rebellious following, who told them in fact that they should retire if they could not take the lead in active terrorism. In August some leading members of the party met in Dacca and decided that Government officials should be murdered and that Government money should be looted. Later on. it was declared that the failure of the Round Table Ccnference was to be the signal for the indiscriminate murder of Europeans.
Policy and activity of leaders in internment. The interned leaders of this party, like those of the other terrorist parties, spent their time in the camps or jails preparing their members-s who were interned with them for the resumption of terrorism as soon as they were released. They viewed with concern the frequent arrests of members of the party after the commission of robberies and dacoities, and seat out instructions, that, rather than risk the safety of the members in a series of comparatively speaking unremunerative crimes, it would be better to concentrate on a few crimes from which a large sum of money could be expected.On the Sth January 1932 detenu Chuni Lai Mukherji of this party was interviewed by an officer of the Intelligence Branch, to whom he stated that Government had been able to check the activities of his party for the time being but only because his party, although big, was not well organised. He hoped, however, that its activities would continue in spite of Governments repressive measures, for, he said, indepen-dence would never be obtained without the secret movement. His party intended in future to murder not only European officials but also Indian officials, Hindu and Muhammadan. Throughout 1931 this party was vigorously attacked by the police, with the result that all the important leaders have been arrested. This is undoubtedly the reason why the party has not given effect to its policy of indiscriminate assassina-tioii and has been unable to organise district risings. The party has a large stock of firearms and bombshells and is for this reason still a serious menace to Government.5. General conclusions. The year 1932 opens with all terrorist parties badly hit by the police campaign. The leaders of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti will doubtless continue their efforts to reassert their authority over their rebellious following. The smashing of the Anushilan Revolted Group might result in their succeeding in making the remaining members of that group realise, at least for the time being, the advantage of the long-sighted policy of the Dacca Anushilan Sainiti and the transient nature of the success of indiscriminate outrages. As long as the Revolted Groups organise and commit crime, however, this is unlikely to happen.There is also the possibility that the groups may amalgamate with the Jugantar party. Efforts to effect this have been made in several districts, but so far without success. The Chittagong absconders, however, have succeeded in interesting the South Calcutta Dacca Anushilan Revolted Group as well as some Jugantar groups in their schemes for further risings and assassinations. If the Chittagong absconders succeed in escaping from Chittagong, avoid arrest for some time, and meet with any success in their schemes, they will xindoubtedly exert a powerful influence over the Dacca Anushilan Revolted Groups and the various district groups of the Jugantar party, for their past record proves that they could furnish the organising brain and driving force now lacking in so many of the district parties.The Jugantar party, even without the help of the Chittagong absconders and the Anushilan Revolted Groups, is in no mood to abandon its terrorist policy. Its head is still turned by its successes and the support it has received from the Congress press. The recent arrest of two very important absconders, Biren Ghosh and Rasamoy Sur, augurs well for the success of police operations against the absconders of the Dacca Sri Sangha groups. The Chittagoug absconders, however, are in touch with these groups and are planning with them further outrages. The situation is still fraught with great clanger, and it is clear that the key to the whole position is the arrest of all the absconders of the Chittagong Armoury raid case and the Dacca Sri Sangha. .        ,&apos;. .It was pointed out in the introduction to the printed report on the activities of terrorists in Bengal in 1930 that the weakness of the terrorists&apos; position was that they were divided into two main groups, the Dacca Anushilan Samiti and the Jugantar party, whose rivalry and mutual jealousy had always prevented amalgamation for their common purpose. The terrorist leaders appreciate this weakness, and Manoranjam Gupta, the Jugantar leader, while in the Buxa camp, was trying to get all parties to join together. In November oue of the detenus of the Hijli camp wrote out his views on the future conduct of terrorist parties. His identity and the party to which ho belongs are not. known, but he undoubtedly strikes the nail on the head He began by expressing his appreciation of the opportunity of discussion which was afforded by the internment of many detenus together in one camp. He went on to say that there were two principal defects in the terrorists. The first was that their goal was not clear in their own minds and that they overestimated their own strength and underestimated th at of the enemy. The second was that there was too much rivalry between groups, although all were working for the same object. One group, for instance, would resent, another g.roup&apos;s launching a campaign without previously
consulting it, and would even derive some smug satisfaction from the fact that, when, the other group was broken up by the police, it had itself escaped. He wrote that assassinations had their use but led to nothing substantial. His conclusions were-that there should be wholehearted co-operation between all groups all over India and that they should be controlled by an elected supreme council. In this way a concerted reply could be given to the oppression of the Government.The amalgamation of the Jugantar party and the Dacca Anushilan Samiti in 1928 was short-lived on account of the mutual jealousy of the leaders of the parties, but-there is no doubt that, when the present terrorist campaign is scotched and the leaders are released, there will be a further attempt to bring all terrorist groups in Bengal, under central control.  The terrorist campaign which began in 1930 surpasses even the long-drawn-out first campaign (1907-1918) in achievement.   The leaders of both parties . must realise that, had the Dacca Anushilan Samiti combined with the Jugantar party in the initial stages, even more striking results might have been achieved.   The-realisation of this may make the leaders of all parties forget their quarrels and work together for their common  object, the expulsion  of the British from India by terrorism.Whether the rival parties bury the hatchet and work together or keep separate, the -next campaign, if allowed to germinate, will be fiercer than the present one.   Terrorist organisations which are on a permanent basis cannot be dealt with satisfactorily by temporary legislation.   Now is the time, therefore, to make a permanent statute of&apos; such powers as are deemed necessary at present to deal with these very dangerous organisations.R. E. A. RAY,Calcutta, Special Superintendent, I.B., C.I.D., Bengal..13th January 1932.B.Brief Note on the Alliance of Congress with Terrorism in Bengal.T.   1921,   Terrorists take part in non-co-operation movement. The terrorists who -had been interned under the Defence of India Act and many who had been convicted for specific offences were released as a result of the amnesty which followed the Royal. Proclamation of December 1919.   They took advantage of the non-violent non-co-operation movement  to  reorganise their scattered  forces.    They joined  in the movement with that very object, and many of them became organisers of bodies of volunteers for non-co-operation activities and recruited many of the volunteers as terrorists.   By the end of 1921 there was a movement on foot in the Congress to-discard the principle of non-violence.2. 1922. Terrorists represented in Bengal Provincial Congress Committee and All-India Congress Committee. The Chauri Chaura massacre followed in February 1922. The Working Committee then passed the famous Bardoli resolution suspending mass civil disobedience. This and the imprisonment of Mahatma Gandhi caused a; lull in the non-co-operation movement. The extremist party, however, which had no faith in the non-violent cult, was steadily increasing. In Bengal, this section was -composed of the terrorists who succeeded in capturing a large number of seats on the executive committees of the various district Congress organisations and became-represented in the Bengal Congress Executive Committee and the All-India Congress Committee. They made several attempts to commit the Bengal Congress Committee to a violent programme.3.   1923.   Terrorists support Mr. C. R. Das&apos;s &quot; Sicarajya, Party &quot; in return for Mr. C. B. Das&apos;s connivance at. the secret conspiracy. In 1923 Congress ranks in Bengal were torn by faction over the question of Council entry which Mr. C. R. Das and his Swarajya party were sponsoring.   Mr. C. R. Das was supported hy the terrorists, without whose help he could never have won his victory for Council entry over the no-changers.   It is known that the leader of the Swarajya party was aware-that his terrorist allies were engaged in criminal conspiracy.   It is also known that his connivance at it was the price that the terrorists demanded for their support,, which  was  essential   to  his   success   in   elections.    Government   attacked this-cohspiracy by arresting the ringleaders under Regulation III.   Most of them were members both of the terrorist party known as the Jugantar party and of the Swarajya: party.   The Swarajya party immediately accused Government of using Regulation HI.
to crush, the Swarajya party and demanded the repeal of Regulation III and the release of the persons arrested under it. It is interesting to record therefore that in 1923 it was noticed that the headquarters of both parties, in. Calcutta were at one and the same place.4. 1924. Qopi Shaha resolution passed. Increase of terrorist influence. in Congress. In 1924 the- terrorist members of the Swarajya party supported the candidature of Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, and it is noteworthy that after his appointment to that post many jobs, in the Corporation were given to terrorists.At the Serajganj Congress Conference Mr, C. R. Das with the help of lais, terrorist supporters succeeded in passing his Hindu-Moslem pact resolution and then in return for their support put through the infamous resolution eulogising Gopi Mohan Shaha, the assassin of Mr. Day, which was a clear incitement to the youth, of Bengal to follow that assassin&apos;s example. The terrorists continued their criminal conspiracies during the year, and the danger was so imminent that Government found it necessary to promulgate the 1924 Ordinance. Many terrorists, among whom there were also many Congress workers, were arrested. The SwaraJ3Ta. party immediately accused Government of deliberately attacking not the terrorists but the Swarajists, and many meetings were held all over Bengal under the auspices of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee at which prominent leaders of the Swarajist party eulogised assassins. In this year 28 ex-detenus or political ex-convicts were.office-bearers of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee and 21 revolutionaries or sympathisers were elected to the All-India Congress Committee.5. 1925. Death of Mr. C. R. Das. Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta pursues same policy, with terrorists. Early in 1925 a prominent member of the Congress party admitted during an interview with a high Government official that he knew personally of the existence in Bengal of a terrorist movement, the members of which were hand in glove with the Swarajists.In January 1925 the Bengal Congress Committee passed a resolution expressing their deep sorrow at the death of a terrorist convict who was captured in 1925, offering armed resistance to the police. It also passed a resolution recommending the establishment of a Political Sufferers&apos; Fund, one of the objects of which was to provide for the dependants of political sufferers sentenced to capital punishment. At the Faridpur Congress the terrorists, displeased by the presidential address, in which it was declared that the terrorist movement would not lead to Swaraj, used their influence to defeat the President in two resolutions condemning the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and the violent activities of the terrorist party which the terrorists held to be couched in a form of which they could not approve. Mr. C. R. Das, the President, subsequently compromised with them and the resolutiona were passed in an amended form.After Mr. C. R. Das died in June, Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta, his, successor, pursued the same policy with the terrorists. He too probably realised that the Swarajya party could uot succeed in election campaigns, whether for Council or municipal bodies, without their help. The terrorists depended on the financial support of the Swarajya party. It is thus clear that the Swarajya party and the terrorists were interdependent and were component parts of the same revolutionary machine. In the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee elections of 1925 the terrorists had a majority of 26,6. 1926. Terrorists from Karmi Savgha. Resignation of Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta. Decrease of terrorist representation in Congress Executive. In 1926, haviug con-solidated their influence over the Congress, they organised themselves into the Karmi Sangha or Workers&apos; League. Members of the Karmi Sangha played an active part in the communal riots, and took advantage of the situation to improve their terrorist organisation. In May they were determined to do away with the Hindu-Moslem Pact, so by organised rowdyism they swamped the meeting at the Krishnagar Congress and passed a resolution rescinding it. The Bengal Provincial Congress Committee, however, declared that meeting null and void, upset the resolution, formed a new Executive Committee, and. gave none of the nominated seats to members of the Karmi Sangha. In August J, M. Sen Gupta compromised with the Karmi Sangha in view of the approach of the Congress elections and appointed 12 of them to the Executive Committee of the Congress. In, December he resigned and was succeeded as President of the Bengal Congress Committee by Mr. B. N. Sasmal, who nominated only four Karmis to. the. Executive Committee.866 B
7. 1927. Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose succeeds Mr. B. N. Sasmal. Terrorists regain representation in Congress Executive. In 1927, however, the Karmi Sangha were able to force Mr. B. N. Sasmal to resign, and of 60 members of the new Executive Committee 20 were terrorists. The Karmi Sangha agreed to work under the Congress with Subhas Bose, who succeeded Mr. B. N. Sasmal as President. At this time there was an agreement between Subhas Bose and the terrorists that the latter should run the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee under his guidance. They drew up a scheme for a Workers&apos; League the basis of which was complete independence. This scheme was discussed at the Madras Congress of 1927, and the Bengal revolutionary group persuaded Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru to move the Independence resolution, which was, however, defeated by Mr. Satyamurti&apos;s amendment.8. 1928. Independence League for India formed. In spite of Bengal vote, complete independence amendment rejected at Calcutta Congress. Early in 1928 the Bengal terrorist party formed the Independence League for India and determined to capture the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee, in which they had largely succeeded by the end of the year, and formed a Congress Volunteer Corps called the Bengal Volunteers, which they intended to be their fighting force when the rising was brought about. Binay Bose, Dinesh Gupta, and Sudhir Datta, the assassins of Colonel Simpson in 1930, were members of this corps in Dacca, which was indeed largely, if not entirely, composed of terrorists. At the Calcutta Congress in 1928 Suhhas Chandra Bose moved an amendment to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s resolution. His amendment was to the effect  that there could be no freedom as long as the British connection remained and that the goal of the Congress should be Complete Independence. His amendment was lost, however, by 1,350 votes to 973. Two-thirds of the -Bengal delegates voted for the amendment. The Bengal revolutionaries had strived hard to get this resolution carried.9. 1929. Complete independence resolution passed at Lahore Congress. They were successful at the Lahore Congress of 1929, however, for Mahatma Gandhi himself moved the Independence resolution, which was then adopted. It was at the Lahore Congress that the Congress proved themselves to be largely terrorist in sympathy by the voting on Mr. Gandhi&apos;s resolution deploring the attempt to wreck the. Viceroy&apos;s train and congratulating Lord Irwin and Lady Irwin on their escape from death. This resolution was passed it is true, but only by a majority of 148, no fewer than 794 votes being recorded against it.10. 1930. Terrorists exploit civil disobedience movement and open terrorist campaign. The Bengal terrorists- took an active part in the civil disobedience movement in 1930 and many of them were imprisoned for picketing. When this movement was waning they considered that it was time for them to give effect to their policy of violence. The armoury raids took place at Chittagong in April and there the raiders used the Congress office as a centre of preparation and a jumping-off ground for the raiding parties. In August the Jugantar party&apos;s assassination campaign, which is still continuing, opened with the murder of Mr. LoAvman. Throughout the campaign the professedly non-violent Congress encouraged the terrorists by eulogies of assassins and convicts in terrorist cases and by their agitation on behalf of the detenus who were interned only because they were known to have taken part in the terrorist conspiracy which led to the assassination of officials and the looting of the property of Government and private citizens.11. 1931. Split in Congress. Jugantar party supports Mi: Subhas Chandra Bose and Dacca Amishilan Samiti supports Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta.-When the agreement between Subhas Bose and the terrorists was reached the two main terrorist parties were hoping to resume their terrorist campaign in concert with each other. Subsequently, however, the leaders quarrelled and&quot;in this quarrel Subhas Chandra Bose supported the Jugantar party. The result was that-the leader of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti resigned from the executive of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee and joined hands with J. M. Sen Gxipta with a view to turn Subhas Bose and the Jugantar party out of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. This split in the Congress came 1o a head in 1931, when the supporters - of the rival leaders actually caine to blows. - In these incidents Subhas Bose and his party were supjjorted by members of the Jugantar party and J. M. Sen&quot; Gupta-by members of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti.
(j tj jm 1112. Terrorists&apos; views on their connection with Congress. The, following two instances show how the terrorists themselves regard their connection with the Congress.In June 1931 an article appeared in Advance to the effect that certain detenus had been present at a meeting of the detenus at the Buxa Camp at which a resolution in support of J. M. Sen Gupta&apos;s revolt against the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee was passed. This enraged the detenus of the Jugantar party in the camp, who met in July and drew up resolutions in reply. They forwarded these resolutions to the proper authority for transmission to the Advance newspaper. They were, however, withheld.   These resolutions were as follows : &quot; (1) The detenus of Buxa Camp assembled in this public meeting emphatically protest against and condemn the action of the Editor of the Advance in publishing in its issue of the 20th June 1931 an utterly false and mischievous report about a meeting held in this camp on the 16th June 1931 alleged to be attended amongst others by Srijuts Surendra Mohan Ghosh and Manoranjan Gupta where a resolution is alleged to have been passed supporting the revolt of Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta against the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.&quot; This meeting considers such report about Srijuts Surendra Mohan Ghosh and Manoranjan Gupta as derogatory to their reputation and sense of self-respect inasmuch as the report purports to impute &quot; (i) That these gentlemen can be supporters of a move, which being subversive of all discipline in the premier political organisation in the country, can only be detrimental to national interests and can only benefit the enemies of national freedom.&quot; (ii) That these gentlemen  can be supporters of a leader who has, unconsciously, been, in spite of repeated warnings, playing into the hands &quot; of the enemy for the last two years, the conglomeration of interested groupssupporting him being only successors to some anti-national groups, formed in the non-co-operation clays, the real wire-pullers now-a-days finding it more advantageous to keep their groups in the garb of institutions within, the Congress than outside of it.&quot; (in) That these gentlemen can be supporters of a leader who is whole-heartedly with the present ignominious truce which has betrayed the country and retarded its growth towards freedom.&quot; (iv) That these gentlemen can support a leader who has allowed himself to be in a combination with the Government which has been deliberately entered into in order to isolate and crush the front rank fighters in the cause of freedom and who, being a representative of Bengal on the Working-Committee of the Congress, which Committee should have, in the light of history, insisted on the release of political prisoners of all classes without exception to be made a condition precedent to the truce and which Committee should have felt some scruple in sacrificing so many patriots at the altar of any fad, has betrayed Bengal by sitting tight on the-Committee and continuing to lend his moral support to the unceasing-course of oppression and prosecution, arrest and detention without trial of hundreds of patriots, and who has criminally been a consenting party to an arrangement encouraging and smoothly leading to the execution of a number of patriots who might be the pride of any land and of any age.&quot; (v) That these gentlemen can agree to be a party to any political action, conjointly with certain other individuals mentioned in the said report some of whom at least this meeting does not consider to be patriots and who have, in the opinion of this meeting, been placed in detention only in order that they may be better suited to work against national interests in future.&quot; (2) This meeting requests the Editor of the Advance, as a gentleman, to contradict the said report as utterly false, misleading and malicious and admit in his paper that he published the said report without proper enquiry and thereby make amends for what has been done to injure Srijuts Surendra Mohan Ghosh and Manoranjan Gupta&apos;s reputation in public eyes.&quot;It is manifest (a) that members of the Jugantar party in the Buxa Camp professed allegiance to Subhas Chandra Bose, who was himself interned in 1924 during the last 866 0
terrorist campaign and has now been made a State prisoner under Regulation III, and (o) that they regard themselves and the executed assassins as the front rank fighters in the cause of freedom.In March 1931 the undertrial accused in the Chittagong armoury raid case sent a letter to Mr. Gandhi in which, after complaining how the terrorists, &quot; fighters who had taken the vow of liberating the Motherland through violent means &quot; and held that &quot; the widespread and indiscriminate murder of Europeans was the only panacea for -the vital malady that is eating away the very vitality of our nation,&quot; had been disregarded in the Gandhi-Irwin pact, they wrote as follows : &quot; You can certainly not deny the fact that in almost all the Provinces the Congress programme has been worked out by the men most of whom have got violence as their policy in heart, and especially in Bengal, where the disobedience campaign has achieved the highest amount of success, ninety per cent, of the Congress workers are open revolutionaries to whom no doubt all the credit of the success goes.&quot;13. Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta&apos;s vieics on connection of Congress with terrorists. The following extracts from a speech made by Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta, a member of the All-India Congress Committee, show in what light the Congress viewed the detenus, persons who were interned by Government because they were engaged in terrorist conspiracies and who style themselves &quot;the front rank fighters in the cause of freedom.&quot; On the 8th March 1931 at the All-Bengal Students&apos; Conference, Mr. J. M. -Sen Gupta said :  &quot;My friends, it seems to me that it was all ordained by Providence, otherwise how is it that when I entered this hall a resolution should actually be under discussion on a question which has been agitating the whole of India and particularly the young minds of Bengal for the past few days ?&quot; My friends, I am not here to speak on behalf of the Indian National Congress or the Working Committee of the Congress or Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Indian nation. I am here as one of you. Mahatma Gandhi represents you, me, all men and women of the whole of India. And because both you and I know that you will not, in the interest of your country, in your own interest, in the interest of all that you hold dear to yourselves, pass a resolution which will make you later hang down your heads in shame.&quot; You have not heard Mahatmaji, you do not know the implications of the document issued to the Press by the Government of India. Do not be superficial readers. Read that document through and through. Get to the bottom of the words.   Read it carefully and find out what the significance of that document is.&quot; My friends, you and I know, and so also knows Mahatma Gandhi, that there -can be no peace in India unless every young man is released from prison. There is no doubt about that. There is no man who could have fought with greater ability, with greater strength for the release of these young men than Mahatma Gandhi himself. Remember, my friends, that there has been a war, and after the war a truce has been declared. I ask you to realise and understand the distinction between truce and peace. But even in this circumstance, we did a lot which in ordinary case we could not claim. We got back actually those who were taken as prisoners in the non-violent war.&quot; With regard to the violent prisoners, I pressed for their release all through, -and asked Mahatmaji to press for their release before the Viceroy when he met &quot;him. But it was found impossible to make the release of those convicted of violent crime a condition precedent of truce. My friends, I do not blame you, because I know that you are all filled with the loftiest of sentiments, because all of you feel for those detained without trial. But do you. not know that most of the 500 young men who have been interned without trial and without charge, -are my intimate friends and co-workers in the Congress? I told this to Mahatma Gandhi and others. I further told Mahatmaji that every one of them is a staunch Congressman many of them are office-bearers of the different Congress Committees. I have represented their case to Mahatmaji and I have pressed their case before the Working Committee. My friends, you can create such a situation by so strengthening the hands of the Congress and of Mahatma Gandhi that in the course of a few da3*s, in the course of a few weeks, they will be with us. If you can create such a situation by strengthening your national organisation it would be possible to have even the &apos; violence &apos; prisoners released just as the &apos; non-violence&apos; ones.&quot;
c.Extract from a Report, dated 18th February 1932, regarding1 attempts tosmuggle Arms into Bengal.This matter of arms smuggling is at the present time the crux of the terrorist situation in Bengal. As a result of a continuous and most virulent propaganda campaign for years past, which included the most fulsome eulogies of terrorist assassins, and as a result of a decidedly unsatisfactory atmosphere in many schools and colleges in Bengal, the number of terrorists or potential terrorists in that Province is, for all practical purposes, unlimited. Consequently, the terrorist situation is governed not by the number of terrorists but by the number of weapons they can get hold of. Naturally, the demand produces a supply, and, as you know, there is a continuous stream of arms coming into Bengal, either smuggled sporadically by seamen (generally from Continental ports), or filtering in from Indian States which do not control the trade in arms.The Calcutta police are waging a constant war against smuggling by seamen, and they have a special staff employed for this purpose which has succeeded in raking in a number of weapons, but they have lately pointed out that it is useless for them to take more adequate steps in this direction in Calcutta than are taken at other ports. As a matter pf fact, at all ports a good deal of attention is paid to arms smuggling, but no special police staff exists at the other major ports in order to cope with it. This matter has been taken up, but naturally immense difficulty is being experienced to overcome the results of financial stringency. No impoverished Local Government is anxious to spend money to prevent the smuggling of arms when it itself is not suffering from the effects of that smuggling. The position as regards Indian States is equally difficult. A number of them have no Arms Act, and freedom from the Arms Act is a cherished possession. We have at various times taken up this matter with the Foreign and Political Department, and recently they have addressed Agents to the Governor-General on the subject, but here again we shall experience tremendous resistance.You will remember that in my letter No. 2/R.A./31, dated the 3rd March 1931, I informed you that the Bengal Intelligence Branch received information to the effect that 500 revolvers had been smuggled into Rangoon by Japanese, and that Bengali terrorists were endeavouring to buy them from the smugglers. The Bengal police received information about this consignment from a number of directions. Frequently the reports were garbled, but the impression left in Bengal and on us here was that there was a great deal of truth in them. The Burma C.I.D., however, failed to obtain any corroboration whatsoever and are inclined to disbelieve them. Recently, however, we know that new weapons have been smuggled from Burma into India Ana the Madras coast, and some of these are now actually in the possession of the police. We consider that these a&apos;eiy probably Avere part of the consignment referred to above. Rash Behari Bose seems to have been at the back of this conspiracy to smuggle arms, and undoubtedly continuous efforts are made by terrorists in Bengal in keep in touch Avith him and to establish channels for arms smuggling from the Far East.There is, of course, also the possibility of transhipment by sea, and a very suspicious Japanese motor-boat was seen last year near the mouth of the Hooghly. The crew declared that they were fishing, but, no fishing apparatus was seen by the pilot who boarded it. It is possible that such a boat is employed to take on board at sea for India arms ostensibly consigned to China, but we believe that if a large consignment was landed here Ave would hear about it. But beyond the alleged consignment referred to above we have, however, no definite information of arms being smuggled in bulk into India from the Far East or elsewhere, though rumours of such consignments sometimes reach us. Consequently, I can give you nothing that woidd enable you to identify consignments of arms intended for India.In the early part of this letter 1 mentioned the atmosphere in schools and colleges in Bengal. In doing so I Icuoav that I am going beyond the terms of-reference, but arms smuggling is so inextricably mixed tip with terrorists that one leads me to the other. As you know, for some years past the Calcutta Corporation has been in the hands of the Swaraj party,- Avhich has been divided into the groups led by -J. M. Sen Gupta and Subhas Chandra Bose, both of whom at various times have been in power. J. M. Sen Gupta has mainly been dependent, for his political workers, on the Anushilan terrorist party, while Subhas Bose has similarly been served by the Jugantar group. These terrorists, at the time of elections, are the only people with sufficient energy to undertake really active political propaganda, and are prepared to picket polling
booths, to beat tip voters (in the literal sense), and to do all that is necessary to make an election successful in Bengal. Naturally, they must have their share of the profits, and their chief reward consists of the appointments at the disposal of the Corporation. Consequently, a large number of such appointments are held by terrorists, many of whom are ex-detenus. In return for employment they have to subscribe a portion of their pay&apos; to the terrorist purse, so funds are generally available for the purchase of. arms. (Terrorist funds are further augmented by the proceeds of postal and other robberies, a number of which have been committed by terrorists in Bengal.) Not a few of the appointments held by terrorists in Calcutta are&apos; in schools, and it is easy to imagine what the students are likely to imbibe from teachers of this type. The Government of India have recently addressed the Government of Bengal on the subject of the schools in Calcutta.I do not wish to imply that a poisonous atmosphere in schools is confined to Calcutta. Education in Bengal is a transferred subject, and facilities for it have to be provided in a manner popular with the public. So perhaps it is not surprising that we have heard some funny things about schoolmasters in Bengal. The result of all this is a terrorist situation for which the special powers given to the Bengal police do nothing more than provide a brake inadequate to stop the bus, i.e. to eradicate terrorism. Its eradication is beyond the powers of the police and requires the complete co-ordination of Government resources (coupled with more signs than are at present apparent of a growing healthy public opinion), which, so far, has been impossible to attain. It is the recognition of this fact that has made us concentrate on the smuggling of arms, admittedly an attack on the symptom and not on the disease.
