Import Duties Advisory Committee, Caxton House (West Block),Tothill Street,Westminster.To the Lords Commissioners op His Majesty&quot;s Treasury.May it please Tour Loe.dshi.ps.We were appointed on 1st March last under Section 2 (1) of the Import Duties Act, 1932, and now beg to submit our first recom-mendations.I.Additions to the Free Dist.2. Under Section 1 (3) we may recommend that goods of any class or description be exempted from the general ad valorem duty, but by the proviso to that Section we are estopped from taking such questions into consideration before the 29th August except in cases of special urgency. Representations have been made to us in re-gar-d to certain classes of articles, but we are not at present sub-knitting any recommendation under this Section.II.The Imposition of Additional Duties.3. The position in regard to the imposition of additional duties is one of some complexity. Under the Import Duties Act Parlia-ment has contemplated the future division of the national imports into four broad categories : (i) goods chargeable with duty under enactments other than the Import Duties Act;(ii) goods in the Free List of the Import Duties Act ;(iii) goods subject only to the general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent, under that Act;(iv) goods (chargeable with the general ad valorem duty) which are subject to an additional duty under Section 3 of the Act.      .In addition special provision is made in the Act with regard to goods of a composite character. 14. Goods falling into the first category above cannot be considered for an additional duty except (under Section 3 (5)) in anticipation of the expiration of the special duty for the time being chargeable under aiiother enactment. It will be convenient in this our first recommendation briefly to review these special duties and the terms and conditions under which they are chargeable.
5. They are a heterogeneous coPection, having been imposed at widely different dates and with various objects in view. The chief categories are as follows : (a) Budget duties of the pre-war type e.g., the duties on alcohol, tobacco, sugar, coffee, cocoa, etc. These duties were imposed purely for revenue purposes, some being on articles of luxury, and nearly all are specific duties i.e., not on an ad valorem basis. Expressed in relation to current values of the respective commodities they,show a wide range running up to well over 100 per cent, in some cases. Being coupled with an equivalent excise duty wherever appropriate, these duties have in few cases any protective effect.(6) The McKenria Duties were imposed in 1915 for a variety of reasons mostly connected with the War. They cover motor vhicles, accessories and parts, musical instruments, clocks and \. &apos;.ches-the duties in all these cases being 33J per cent, ad v...orer,i and cinematograph films at specific rates. In these cases no corresponding excise duties were imposed and the duties have therefore a pronounced protective character, though they were not originally imposed, or reimposed in 1925, or extended in 1926, on this ground.(r) The Silk Duties, both customs and excise, were imposed for revenue purposes in 1925, being selected on grounds of luxury. They are levied at various rates, specific and ad valorem, on artificial and natural silk, and their products, running up to 33J per cent, or more.(d) The customs duty on Hydrocarbon Oils (mainly petrol, was imposed on very similar grounds (i.e. for revenue purposes and as a luxury tax) in 1928.. Special considerations in regard to the equalisation of road and raii competition also entered into the selection of petrol for taxation. As no corresponding excise duty was imposed the arrangement was protective and the degree of protection afforded to the production of motor spirit from home sources has been increased by the increase of the duty from 4d. a gallon, first,to 6d. and last September to 8d. a gallon.(el Unlike any of the foregoing, the Key Industry Duties were from the outset intended to be protective, the object being to secure adequate production in this country of certain articles of a pivotal character which were regarded as vital to the national safety in time of war or of outstanding importance to industry.. They coyer;a wide range of commodities such as optical and scientific instruments,, wireless valves, magnetos, synthetic organic chemicals; [compounds&apos; of the rare earth metals, laboratory glass and porcelain ware and hosiery latch . needles.&apos; The duty is in most cases. 33J per cent. )at valorem, but for optical Instruments and optical glass the higher rate11546 a 2
of 50 per cent; lias been, in force since 1926. Under the Finance Act of that year the Key &quot;Industry Duties were con. tinued until 9.h August,1 1936.     &quot;  : :   &apos;     -   &apos;(/) The Safeguarding of &apos;Industry - Duties were imposed originally under Part II of the&apos;Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, and subsequently by Finance Acts in, accordance with the policy enunciated in a White Paper (&quot; Safeguarding of Industries: Procedure and Enquiries&apos;&apos;) issued in 1925, which provided that in certain circumstances duties might be imposed in cases where industries in this country were suffer-ing from especially severe competition from abroad. Under Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, duties of &apos;3ty per cent, ad valorem, were imposed for a period of five years in each case on fabric gloves and glove fabric; domestic and illuminating glassware,&apos;domestic hollow-ware (aluminium and enamelled) and gas mantles. : Under the White Paper pro-cedure, duties were imposed for a period of five years at the rate of 33 per cent, twi valorem on ; lace and embroidery, leather and fabric gloves, cutlery and buttons: at the rate of 25 per cent, on wrought enamelled domestic hollow-ware; at the rate of 16g per cent., on packing and wrapping paper; and at specific rates on gas mantles and on tableware, of translucent and vitrified pottery. ! Of these, only the following duties now remain in force and. they are . due to expire on the respective dates shown : Translucent and vitrified pottery 18th April, 1932, 28s. a cwt. &apos;Buttons 27th April, 1933, 3,3^ per cent.. ad valorem.Hollow-ware, wrought enamelled 12th Juue, 1933, 25 per cent, ad valorem.(fir) The duties under the Abnormalimportations- (Customs Duties) Act, 1931, and the Horticultural Products (Emergency Customs Duties) Act, 1931&apos;,, were intended, to check&apos; abnormal importations prior to, the introduction of a tariff and in so doing to strengthen the exchanges. The &quot;orders, made under these Acts comprise a long list of articles of diverse character. The duties under the Abnormal Importations Act are all at a flat ad valorem rate 6f 50 per ceht;:artd expire on the 19th May next&apos; unless previously revoked .&apos; The duties on horticultural &apos; products are specific arid rim for various periods specified in the Orders; &quot;but -no duty caii- run beyond the expiration of the Horticultural Products Act on 10th December next!6.. It will be observed that out&apos; of &apos;,the foregoing list of com-modifies at present sublet, to special.duties arid therefore exempt from, any duty under &apos;the/JJmpQrt&apos; J^?ji$\ AftV; the following will . cease to be, so subject ^f^/.^^^^t^^X&apos;^4,&apos;-^^f^^^%&apos; under Section 3 (5) of the Impdrt&quot;Duties &apos;Aet&apos;, &quot;fall to&apos;be considered now

All goods included in Orders under the Abnormal Importa-tiotas (Customs Duties) Act- 19th May, 1932.&apos;7. Under Section -3 (1).. of. the, Import Duties Act recorumenda-tions for additional duties may be submitted in respect of goods of ;.ny class cr description which in our opinion are &apos;.&apos; either articles of luxury or articles of a kind which are being produced, or arc likely .within a reasonable time to be produced, in the United . Kingdom in quantities vyhich are, substantial in relation to United Kingdom consumiption, Under. Section 3 (2) we are further directed to &quot; have regard to the advisability in the national interest ol restricting imports Into the United .Kingdom and the interests generally of trade and industry in the United Kingdom &quot;.The terms of Section 3 (2) envisage the imposition on a sub-stantial range of imports (other thanthose referred to in paragraph 5 above) of duties at higher&apos;rates than the general 10 per cent.8, In following this&apos;,intention two courses are open to us. We could&apos; make.,careful enquiry into, the economic position of one selected industry after another,,investigating its competitive position and its relations to other industries with a view to arriving at the most appropriate degree of protection in each case. Such a process would inevitably take v.\yt&quot;much time. Meanwhile most of the in-dustfies of. the country&apos;. won Id be left in a grave state of uncertainty and the. urgent needs of. industry and of stimulating employment at home would remain unsatisfied. Moreover, the serious emergency which gave rise to the Abnormal Importations Act might well revive in May next.9. The other alternative, so far as industrial products are con-cerned, is to&apos;proceed&quot;on the basis of the information which has been collected by the Board of Trade in recent years, supplemented by such enquiries of a general character as we have been able to make in the time available, arid endeavour at. once to cover by recom-mendations of a fairly general character as large a part of the field as possible. This would necessarily entail postponing for sub-sequent enquiry and recommendation the manifold adjustments which will be needed to meet the detailed circumstances of in-dividual industries. It is this course that we have decided to adopt. We fully recognise,that with the limited information at our disposal it will involve mistakes and omissions. &quot;We trust, however, to be able to correct any difficult situation so arising soon after it is brought to our notice, and the adverse effect on our trade and in-dustry of mistakes of this nature; if they are promptly corrected, must be immaterial&apos; -hi; comparison t with. that of delay and un-certainty. Parliament,i]as: by the Import Duties Act decided to make use of the instrument of a tariff for the assistance of British
trade and industry and the recommendations we submit will enable effective use to be made of it forthwith.10. Proceeding on these lines we submit a schedule of additional import duties which we recommend should be imposed at the earliest possible date (Schedule I). It will be observed that the schedule covers most of the items now included in the Orders under the Abnormal Importations Act and in these cases our recom-mendations can only take effect from the date of expiration of such Orders. It would, however, be inconvenient to have these Orders continuing in operation concurrently with the remainder of this schedule, and your Liordships may feel disposed, therefore, to approach the Board of Trade with a view to the cancellation of those Orders at an early date in order that the full schedule i. :,y be brought into operation at the same time. Where an additional duty is not recommended in the schedule, we are of opinion that the existing duty should nevertheless be terminated forthwith.11. Outside the category of foods, the schedule covers by far the greater part of the manufactured products now being imported into this country that in our opinion comply with one or other of the qualifying conditions of Section 3 (1) of the Import Duties Act. In some doubtful cases we have made no recommendation pending further investigation. We have also excluded many commodities on special grounds, for example, on account of their importance to other industries or because for one reason or another it is questionable whether any benefit would accrue to this country from the imposition-tion of an additional duty. Difficulties of definition have prevented our dealing satisfactorily with certain other classes of commodities on this preliminary review.12. Special reference should be made to the heading &quot; Machinery.&quot; The national output of machinery is very great in relation to our imports and we are advised that there are few classes of machinery of any magnitude which are not made in this country in substantial quantity and, further, that the production of many imported types is likely to be transferred to this country as the result of a tariff. At the. same time it is undoubtedly true that our imports comprise certain very specialised kinds of machines which are not produced here; indeed some are so highly specialised that the whole world demand is easily met by one factory and any attempt to set up a separate productive unit in this country in such a case would Obviously be wasteful. We are also anxious that the greatest&apos; possible facilities should be afforded for the establishment of new industries in this country.13. We have given considerable stiufy to the question how best provision can be made to meet the foregoing cases while at the same time stimulating the maximum home production of machinery. We have little doubt that we shall in time be able to prepare more
detailed schedules, either of machinery to be subject to additional duty, or of machinery to be exempt therefrom or possibly placed on the free list, though the fact that the British Engineers&apos; Association divide their field into 2,000 headings shows that the task will be no light one. For the present, at any rate, we are of opinion that some arrangements of an elastic or discretionary nature are required to ensure that no avoidable handicap is placed in the way of users in this country in this regard. With this end in view we suggest to Your Lordships that Parliament be asked in the coming Finance Bill to empower the Commissioners of Customs on receipt of a suit-able certificate to allow particular consignments of machinery to enter this country under exceptional conditions. The conditions we have in mind are :  (1) that the machinery should be of a class recommendedby us for special treatment, under this arrangement for a specified period.(2) that relief in i-egard to the consignments falling within any class should be from additional duty or from all duty as wemay recommend.(3) that within such classes as aforesaid relief should only begiven in special cases where it is shown that the machinery ofthe kind in question is not for the time being procurable in thiscountry and that its importation is desirable. We recognise that exceptional powers of this character ought to be limited to the narrowest possible field and while at the outset we should feel bound to recommend that they should be applied to a wide range of machinery, we should hope to be able before long to submit recommendations for greatly restricting their operation.14. Apart from iron and steel products, to which we shall refer later, we have proceeded as far as possible on the basis of a uniform rate of additional duty for fully manufactured imports of goods that can be produced in substantial quantity in this country, with a lower rate for some products where special considerations arise and higher rates for articles of a luxury or semi-luxury character. In adopting at the outset simple arrangements of this character, we have been greatly influenced by the paramount importance of keep-ing the burden of additional Customs administration within manage-able dimensions. This consideration has also obliged us to accept for the present a classification of commodities which in many cases js far from satisfactory as the basis of a comprehensive tariff. We realise that under this procedure we shall not be able to give full recognition at once to the needs of particular industries which may ,be found on detailed investigation to present a convincing case! for a higher level of protection than that generally accorded.-r This defect is, we fear, inescapable if the general scheme of the Import Duties Act is to be inaugurated with reasonable caution;i We can, however, give the assurance that there will be no avoidable * delay
in considering individual cases of this kind, and we believe that no injury will result even to those industries which are at present enjoying the exceptional measure of protection afforded by the Abnormal Importations Act.15. What should be the general level of protection in the case of industries presenting no very exceptional features has engaged our earnest consideration in the light of the representations submitted ,to us and of the enquiries we have been able to make. We shall, we believe, be expressing the general opinion if we say at once that we do not regard the 50 per cent, rate of duty under the Abnormal Importations Act as a precedent for this purpose. That rate of duty was intended to operate only for a short period prior to the intrbduc-tion of a general tariff and during that period to be practically pro-hibitive. We derive more assistance from the earlier decisions of Parliament in regard to particular industries. It will be observed from paragraph 5 that the rate of 33i per cent, has been adopted with few exceptions in post-war legislation of definitely protective intent, but in deciding how far that rate is suitable for our present purpose the following considerations have to be borne in mind : (i) The industries covered by this legislation represent only a very small part of the industrial field, and, in consequence, any increases of prices of their products that, may have resulted from the imposition of the duties have had no appreciable effect on the general cost of living and any adverse reactions on other industries have also been comparatively unimportant. The situation in both respects might be very different were the same degree of protection to be applied to large sections of industry.(ii) Apart from the McKenna duties (where the rate of 33?,-per cent, had its origin in Avar conditions) the rate of 33J per cent, has in the past only heen applied to industries presenting exceptional features such as their pivotal character or the nature of the foreign competition to which they are subject. At the moment, however, we are concerned with the general level of protection to be afforded to industries of a normal character, and we are reserving for later and more detailed consideration the question of giving some higher degree of protection in selected cases.: 16. Taking these and other factors into consideration we have decided to recommend that in the case of fully manufactured articles that are being produced, or are likely within a reasonable time to be produced, in substantial quantities in this country, the general level of additional duty should be 10 per.cent., making, with the general ad valorem duty, a total duty of 20 per cent. &apos; For articles to&quot; which a lower additional rate appears to us appropriate we have mostly recommended a total duty of 15 per cent., while total rates of 25 or 30 per cent, are included for certain articles of a
luxury or semi-luxury character;, A few exceptions to this general scheme call for special mention. The rate of 33-g iper cent, is re-commended for bicycles and parts thereof, arid for all ball bearings not forming part of another article. Here considerations of con-venience of administration obviously point to the duty being the same as lor motor vehicles. On similar grounds we have recoin-rriended the extension of the 33J per cent, rate, which applies to certain chemicals, when synthetically produced, to some of the same chemicals when obtained from natural sources.17. It will be observed that the schedule includes very few horticultural products or other articles of food. As regards hoiti-cultural products within the range of the Horticultural Products Act the existing Orders appear to us to meet the more pressing needs; and power still remains under that Act to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to deal with any emergency arising in the present year. We prefer, therefore, to postpone for a time any recommendations in regard to articles covered by this Act until we have been able to examine the situation more thoroughly.Food products are of outstanding importance by reason of the extent to which they enter into the cost of living; no less than 60 per cent, of the Ministry of Labour cost of living index being based upon retail food prices. While we recognise the desirability of stimulating the production in this country of many food pro-ducts now figuring largely in the national imports, we have to take cognisance of the action that is being taken, or is known to be in contemplation, by the Government in this direction otherwise than by way of import duties. Outside this field of action we find that in the more important cases the effect of any additional duties oh the cost of living is dominated by the treatment of imports from other parts of the Empire. Under Section 4 of the Import Duties Act all imports of Empire products are exempt from the general ad valorem duty and any additional duty until the 15th November next, and the arrangements to come into force after, that date in regard to products from Dominious and India will be the subject of discussion, at the Ottawa Conference next July. In those circumstances, and until we can estimate the effect of our recommendations more precisely we have decided to recommend additional duties on food products only in a few cases.18. It is only to be expected that in the framing of a com-prehensive tariff mistakes of definition, classification, etc. will arise calling for immediate correction. In addition there are bound to be reactions and interactions that cannot now be antici-pated, and some of those may be so adverse as tp require speedy remedy. Such corrections and remedies we shall endeavour to provide without avoidable delay. Further, we wish to make it clear that we shall endeavour, in our recommendations to deal with any
joattempts to exploit the consumer, either industrial or private, under cover of the protection to be afforded by the Import Duties Act.. 19. Apart from exceptional adjustment of the character indicated in the foregoing paragraph, we are anxious to give the maximum assurance to industry as to the stability of the protection now to be afforded. Without giving any binding pledge in the matter, we desire to state that it is not oav intention to recommend any reduc-tion in the general level of protection now recommended during the next twelve months. In some cases it may be found convenient to convert the ad valorem duties into specific rates, but these will as far as possible be of no less value. We propose mainly to direct our attention in the near future to those industries requiring excep-tional treatment. In the course of our preliminary survey cases have already come to our notice in which some higher rate of pro-tcction than 20 per cent, might be warranted, but we have not been able as yet to give full consideration to the intricate issues involved. In some cases the re-establishment of an industry on a satisfactorv basis may be dependent quite as much on its proper reorganisation and re-equipment as on the degree of protection to be afforded.20. Among the industries calling for special consideration prob-ably the most difficult case of all is presented ,by the iron and steel industry. It is so urgent that the treatment of this industry on the general lines contemplated in other cases seems to us quite in-appropriate. For other industries we have adopted as our normal standard a level of protection of 20 per cent, for the fully manufac-tured product : in this industry the most intense competition is being experienced in regard to products which are themselves the material of other industries. It would be an ill service to the hundred and one industries in this country making use of these pro-ducts if for the sake of any temporary advantage that may be gained by the importation of surplus foreign supplies offered at sacrificial prices our native iron and steel industry were allowed to be overwhelmed, or even seriously contracted. We are satisfied that the maintenance of a prosperous iron and steel industry in the highest degree of efficiency is essential to the economic progress of this country, while from the point of view of national security it must still be regarded as vital. We accept therefore the preliminary proposition * that this industry shall be adequately protected, amd protected at once.. 21. But the numerous enquiries already made into this industry make it all,,too clear &quot;that we cannot hope without more detailed investigations to. lay down even the framework of a permanent scheme. for. placing, the industry again in a position to play its proper part, in ,the national economy. While those investigations are. proceeding^..however, it is essential, if the position of the in-dustry isriot.tp\.be, further prejudiced, to check the abnormal im-portations of qompetitive iron and steel that have been coming into
this country in recent months at very low prices. We. are satisfied that the stocks of such products now in this country are on the whole sufficient to permit a temporary check of this character to be imposed without serious detriment to industries making use of such products. We recommend, therefore, that an additional duty of 23-J per cent, ad valorem making a total of 33J per cent, be imposed forthwith on spiegeleisen and ferro-mangariese, semi-finished steel iind certain rolling mill products. These are set out in more detail in Schedule IT appended hereto. We contemplate that this duty should be continued subject to any necessary variations that further experience may indicate until we are in a position to submit pro-posals of a more permanent character, and we recommend that it be imposed for a period of 3 months. Should we not have concluded our enquiries within this period we should propose to recommend some short extension.22. We do not wish it to be understood that the consideration of the exceptional claims of other industries will all be defended until we have completed this difficult task presented by the iron and steel industry; still less that the general assurance of 12 months&apos; currency of our main recommendations will operate against any upward revision. We hope to be able to make arrangements where-by all such claims of an urgent character will be considered without avoidable delay.We have ithe honour to beYour Lordships&apos; obedient Servants,(Signed)   G.
