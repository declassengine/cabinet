roCTJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP EIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT. )C R E T, ,  114 (52),COPY NO. cC A B I N E T0POSITION IN THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,I received yesterday afternoon Mr. Dulantys High Commissioner for the Irish Free State, who had informed me a fortnight ago that he had been  summoned to Dublin to meet Mr. De Valera, and also that he knew nothing then of the intentions of the new Irish Free State G-overnment but would report to me on his return.2.      In reply to an enquiry from me as to the position of his GovernmentMr. Lulanty said that the matter was so important that he ought to read to me a summary of their views.        This he did in the form of the following Memo randum.The Oath is not mandatory in the Treaty.&quot;1.V/e have an absolute right to modify ourConstitution as the people desire.3.The Constitution is the people&apos;s Constitution and anything affecting it appertains to our internal sovereignty and is a purely domestic matter.But besides these legal and constitutional con-siderations there is another and paramount consider ation more than sufficient in itself to make the Minister&apos;s decision final and irrevocable. The people have declared their will without am&quot;bigui ty.
The abolition of the Oath was the principal, and dominating issue before the ej.ec.tcrs,,      It has been the cause of all the strife and dissen-8ion in this country since the signing of the Treaty.The people, and not merely those who supported the policy of the present Government, regard it asan intolerable- burden,relic ef modiaevalism.0a test imposed from outside under threat of immediate and terrible wareThe new Government have no desire whatever to be on unfriendly relations with Great Britain., Quite the contrary,.But the British Government must realise that real peace in Ireland is impossible so long as the fall and free representation of the people in their -Parliament is rendered impossible by a test of this character.The Minister and his Government have the most sincere desire that relations between these two countries should be allowed to develop on normal lin&amp;s.     And normal relations between our two islands should naturally be close and friendly.    But there can be no normal relations between us so long as one side insists on imposing on the other aconsci^ee^te^-t which has no parallel in treaty relationships between States-And even if the British Government hold the view that the Oath is mandatory in the Treaty they must recognise that such a test and imposition on the conscience of the people is completely out of place in a political agreement between two countries.&quot;
30     Mro Dulanty explained that his object in reading the document was, &quot;by using their own words, to prevent any mi sunder&quot;standing about his Government&apos;s intentionso40     I said to him that I had to answer a question in the House of Commons on the Irish situation in a few minutes&apos; time and in fairness to myself and the House it would not he right to withhold from thorn that a changed position had arisen on account of the information which he had given me050     The information furnished hy Mr0 Dulanty is confirmed &quot;by the following statement issued &quot;by Mr, de Valera in Dublin last night,&quot;6,1 p0mcThe Exchange Telegraph Company was officially informed at Government Buildings, Dublin,, today that ,/en^.uiries regarding the Free State Governments intentions concerning the Oath of Allegiance were made by the British Government from Mr0 Dulanty, the Irish Free State High Commissioner in London0 Mr0 Dulanty informed the British Government that the Free State Government proposed immediately to remove the Oath from tho Constitution0.   This   it is understood, is the communication to which Mr. Thomas referred in the House of Commons today.In the Free State Senate this evening, president de vh^va. reiterated his Governments policy in-^ivegerd to the Oath and the Land Annuities:-NT&quot;We p;-opose to remove the Oath and retain the Land Annuities at home&quot; he said.    He added that his Government desired to remain on good terms with all nations, especially Great Britain.:t
TIloo6,     It will be seen that the situation arising Is of a very serious character0    It is a challenge to what we hav always regarded as an essential part of the Treaty - viz0 the Oath of Allegiance, and no doubt is left as to the position which the Free State Government take up with regard to the annuities.78     There is a private Notice question in the House of Commons today9 and it is essential that the Governments position should be made clear, as indeed was indicated in the decision of the Cabinet on CP0 86.(32)Q80     Subject to the approval.of the Cabinet, I propose to make the ,s statement -below: -   i f      *3 iUv- c^j^&quot;The High Commissioner for the Irish Free State in answer to my enquiries yesterday informed me that, In the opinion of His Government, the Oath of Allegiance Is not mandatory In the Treaty and that the Irish Free State have an absolute right to niod.i:Cy their constitution as the people desire0   His Majesty&apos;s Government In the United Kingdom have received this information with deep regreto In their vie?/ the Oath is an integral part of the Treaty made ten years ago between the two countries and hitherto honourably observed on both sides0    They a re addressing to His i.Iajestyfs Government in the Irish Free State a communication which will make their standpoint clear beyond a possibility of doubt0His Majesty5e Government in the United Kingdom further understand from a statement made by Mrfl de Valera in Dublin that the Irish Free State Government propose tor-4-
