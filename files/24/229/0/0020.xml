[This Document is the Property o  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1932.186SECRET. Copy No.     39CP. 120 (32).CABINET.KOWEIT OIL CONCESSION.A CABINET decision is needed as to the answer to be given to the United States Government, which has presented an official note requesting that we should not oppose the transfer to predominantly American interests of any oil concession which the Sheikh of Koweit (at the head of the Persian Gulf) may be prepared to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate, which is a British concern. For the reasons stated in the attached memorandum, from which the Colonial Office, the India Office and the Petroleum Department do not dissent, I think we should meet the United States Government in this matter on the lines indicated in paragraph 3. While giving full weight to the difficulties suggested by other Departments, indicated in paragraphs 8 and 9, I submit that in view of the policy approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the desirability of meeting, if possible, American wishes, the Cabinet should approve an answer on the lines suggested.J. S.April 2, 1932.American Wish to secure an Oil Concession in Koweit.1. The Sheikh of Koweit is an independent ruler under British protection, and in 1913 gave His Majesty&apos;s Government an undertaking to grant no oil concession without His Majesty&apos;s Governments consent. The Eastern and General Syndicate, a British concern, secured in 1925 the consent of the Colonial Office to their negotiating with the Sheikh regarding an oil concesion. No stipulation regarding the necessity for a British nationality clause was made in giving this consent. In 1930 the Syndicate, after discussions had taken place between their representative and the Sheikh, approached His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with a draft oil concession, which they had made arrangements to transfer, if obtained, to American interests. (It should be remarked that it is not proved that oil exists in commercial quantities.) They were then informed by the Colonial Office that any concession granted must contain a British nationality clause. In December 1931 the United States Ambassador alluded in conversation with the Secretary of State to the view of the United States Government that American interests should have equal opportunities with British interests in the matter, and the United- States Charge d&apos;Affaires has since pursued the point at the Foreign Office on many occasions, culminating with the delivery of an official note to the Secretary of State on the 30th March.2. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company in August last showed a revived interest in oil in Koweit; and are now carrying out a geological exploration of Koweit to enable them to decide whether to apply for a concession.3. The Foreign Office have taken the view that a dog-in-the-manger attitude would be indefensible both vis-a-vis of the Americans and from the standpoint of the obligation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to consult the Sheikh&apos;s best interests. If the Anglo-Persian Oil Company put forward a satisfactory offer for a concession, well and good; if they do not, His Majesty&apos;s Government should6339   [6807]
not prevent the Sheikh from allowing any concession which he may give to be transferred to United States interests, if he wishes. In these circumstances the Foreign Office feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government should meet the United States Governments views to the extent of replying to Mr. Atherton that they will not insist on the inclusion in any concession of a clause confining it to* British interests, but that it will naturally be necessary that any applications for a concession which may be forthcoming should be examined to see which, if any, would best serve the Sheikh&apos;s interests. It is proposed, also, to add that in any case, on many points, including those designed to safeguard the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Sheikh, the draft concession submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate would need revision.4. The Sheikh&apos;s own attitude in the matter has been equivocal; he has told the local British authorities that he wants no company but an all-British one, but he has written to the representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate to the effect that, if they can reach agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government, he will discuss the matter further with them.5. The Secretary of State for India, on a balance of the conflicting considerations, was disposed to agree with the Government of India&apos;s view that the full British control clause may be dropped, and was prepared to agree to a reply to the United States Embassy on the above lines.6. The Colonial Office, while preferring a British company, feel that, looking at the matter in its widest aspects, it would be unwise to adopt a dog-in-the-manger policy, and see no objection to the proposed reply to the United States Embassy, provided the other Departments concerned agree.7. The Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade also agree in the pro-posed line of reply. They suggest that the policy adopted in Koweit should square with the new general oil policy regarding control on British territory, which has been approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence and was approved in principle by the late Labour Government, subject to discussion at the Imperial Conference. The object of this policy is to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to claim reciprocity from other countries by dropping the old policy of complete British control, while providing the following safeguards designed to meet the requirements of the Service Departments : (1) Foreign capital only to be admitted in cases where foreigners are citizens of countries granting similar advantages to British nationals. (2) The company to be registered in British territory.(3) The majority of employees and at least some of the Directors, including, if possible, the local Managing Director, to be British subjects.(4) At least 50 per cent, of the oil obtained to be refined on British territory, and the plant to be capable of producing fuel oil, suitable for Admiralty use.(5) His Majesty&apos;s Government to retain the right of pre-emption in case of emergency.8. But the Admiralty have now submitted a memorandum arguing that (a) great difficulties would arise from the obligation to protect United States interests on the mainland of Arabia; (b) it is essential to control any oil produc-tion in Koweit, as being particularly favourably situated from the Admiralty point of view. They therefore propose that any oil concession in respect of Koweit should contain, besides the five conditions laid down under the Petroleum Departments policy referred to above, a stipulation that over 50 per cent, of the capital should be British. This would amount to the application of the old policy of absolute British control.9. The Air Ministry support the Admiralty generally in desiring the maintenance of British control.10. The safeguards proposed by the Petroleum Department seem unlikely to cause much difficulty in the present case. (2) and (3) are known to be acceptable to the American interests involved. (4) must clearly be read in the present case as covering Koweiti territory. The Americans are unlikely to object to having to refine 50 per cent, of the oil at Koweit.  Nor are they likely to take
exception to (5), the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to pre-emption in an emergency. If the United States Embassy were informed as suggested in para-graph 3 above, the additional provisos required could be insisted upon, if and when the moment came to examine the Eastern and General Syndicated concession in detail.11. But the stipulation for over 50 per cent, of British capital suggested by the Admiralty would be quite unacceptable to the Americans. It is the essence of the exclusive British Control Clause which the United States Government have pressed His Majesty&apos;s Government to waive. Its retention would be inconsistent with the policy approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence, the whole object of which was to enable British capital to participate in oil concerns in countries where foreign capital is only admitted on condition of reciprocity.12. The Admiralty have expressed great apprehension as to the complica-tions likely to arise from the operations of American interests in Koweit. In case of external danger, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government are in any case bound by their undertakings to the Sheikh to protect the State and its strategical importance would surely also make it essential to do so. Moreover, the United States Government could, if necessary, be informed beforehand that the oil company could expect no greater degree of protection than would be afforded to purely British interests. As regards the Admiralty&apos;s desire for complete control of the oil production, the stipulations proposed by the Petroleum Department in their memorandum on the new oil policy in British territory can surely be regarded as sufficient, since they have been approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence.13. To sum up, the Foreign Office consider that, apart both from the moral obligation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to advance the Sheikh&apos;s interests and from considerations of general oil policy, it is most undesirable, on political grounds, to antagonise the United States Government by insisting that any concession must contain a stipulation that over 50 per cent, of the capital should be British. If, however, it is decided, in principle, to waive this stipulation, the United States Governments representations could be answered on the lines proposed in paragraph 3 above, which should be satisfactory to them, and the other requirements of the Admiralty could then be provided for, if and when the precise terms of any concession come to be negotiated.Foreign Office, March 30, 1932.
