It is requested that special care may be taken to /ensure the secrecy of this document. s &apos;MOST SECRET.156   (32&apos;) . Copy No,CABINET,CCIVIL SERVICB REMUNERATION, Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequern1. Since 1920 Civil Service remuneration has by agreementconsisted, broadly speaking, of a basic rate, together with an addition called cost-of-living bonus, which varies every six months in accordance with the average Ministry of Labour cost-of-living figure,     At&apos;&apos; present the bonus is related to a figure of 150.     The full increase, however, applies only to pay not exceeding 35/- a week ( 91 a year)  or to the- first 35/- of higher rates,     Por higher salaries and wages the increase becomes proportionately lower? disappearing altogether in the higher ranges,,The actual cost-of-living figure is rounded up for bonus purposes to the nearest multiple of 5;    e0g0 the bonus is related to a figure of 150 however slightly the true average figure exceeds 145, and so on.The effect of a five points rise or fall in the figure to which bonus is related is to increase or decrease the pay roll by  Tg millions a year,,20 The Royal Commission on the Civil Service when theyreported in July last not only recommended in favour of the principle of consolidated wages in the Civil Service but submitted a specific scheme for placing existing Civil Servants op-:--- 240TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
consolidated rates of pay.The effect of consolidating Civil Service pay on the terms recommended by the Royal Commission would be to improve the present general level of Civil Service remuneration at a cost of approximately  l-g- millions per annum.      This is not a time when the Government should appear to be giving a lead in raising wage levels, nor incidentally when such an additional burden should he imposed upon the public purse.    Accordingly, with my authority an offer was made to the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council on the basis of the broad applica-tion of the consolidated rates recommended by the Royal Commission less a temporary abatement of 3 per cent,   The practical effect of this proposal would be to effect a slight improvement in the remuneration of Civil Servants below  3ol0o0 a week at a cost of approximately  400,000 a year, and to leave Civil Servants on higher rates at their present levels of pay,3. The Staff Side have replied that this offer, which seemed to me a fair and reasonable one in the circumstances;, affords no basis for a settlement of the problem of Civil Service remuneration or even for discussion.    The Staff Side contentions are as follows&apos;;     During a long period of falling prices the Civil Service has suffered a corresponding reduction in bonus.      Retail prices are now almost at their lowest level and such evidence as is available to the Staff Side indicates an early and possibly a material increase in such prices.      It is therefore unjust and unfair for the Government to introduce fixed inclusive salaries at the present point of time,,       The Staff Side desire a
continuance of the existing arrangement   whereby Civil Service remuneration is automatically adjusted upwards ,-,-r downwards every six months by reference to the rise and fall in the Ministry of Labour cost-of-living index figure. 4. Experience gained as a result of the working ofthe Civil Service bonus agreement amply demonstrates that a system under which Civil Service wages move automatically upwards and downwards in accordance with the movements in retail prices as reflected in the Ministry of Labour cost-of-- living index figure is thoroughly unsound.      Outside wage levels and retail price levels do not consistently move together.      It follows therefore    that a system whereby the remuneration of Civil Servants was automatically adjusted from time to time by reference solely to retail price levels is ill adapted to the fulfilment of the principle to which the Government adhere, namely, that the remuneration of Civil Servants should be determined by reference to outside wage levels-      It would be most un-fortunatc if at any time in the near future no general improvement was taking place in outside wages whereas in the case of the Civil Service there was substantial improve-ment in the levels of remuneration by reason of the automatic application of the existing cost-of-living sliding scale.     The effect would be to put the Civil Servant xn a privileged, position vis a vis the taxpayer at large, who has to foot the wages bill.       The first signs of any such improvement in the remuneration of Civil Servants would be immediately followed, by an intensified demand for at least an equivalent concession to teachers, police and members of the fighting services - tp say
nothing of the unemployed - in the form of an abatement of their present cuts.     Further, the here fact that H.Mt Government had - at this most critical time - re--oomm.permitted itself to the doctrine of the automatic determination of wages by prices would be likely to give a lead to the community which if it were generally followed could not fail to jeopardise an economic recovery. 50 I recommend to my colleagues therefore thatthe Government should reaffirm its adhesion to the principle of consolidated wages for the Civil Service, and that failing agreement with the staff representatives, after a further restatement of the case with amplified reasons and explanations,  the terms of the consolidation proposals already made should be -put into force by executive action on the 1st Septembei next,  coupled wiTsh a specific promise of review at the expiration of twelve months from that date or earlier review if in the judgment of the Staff Side there has been such a material change in circumstances as to justify such earlier review.I an advised that the course of action proposed, which involves the abrogation of the Civil Service Gost-of-Living Agreement of 1920, is likely to give rise to much discontent and agitation among the Civil Service.     But a position cf general wages stability is an essential prelim-inary condition to the hoped for recovery in trade and industry and there can be little hope of creating this position unless the Government should give the strongest possible lead in the case of the remuneration of its uwn servants o(Intdo) N.treasury Chambers, S.V/.1,, 18th April,  1932.
