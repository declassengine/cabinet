(THIS DOCUMENT   IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ) .COPY NO.SECRETCP.139  (52)CABINET. india appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India,  dated 18th April 1932.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated 18th April, 1932,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.The last appreciation v/as written just before the announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Government assuming the responsibility for a communal decision in the absence of any likelihood of an agreement among the communities themselves. The announcement of the 19th March had a very favourable effect on the political situation, and was directly responsible for the decisions reached at the Muslim Conference held immediately afterwards at Lahore. It greatly strengthened the hands of those who were in favour of continued co-operation with the various Constitutional Committees , and although the opposition to this course was still very considerable, Constitutionalists were successful to this extent, that a decision on the relevant resolution was postponed until the beginning of July. In the meantime co-operation continues.The knowledge that His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to announce their decision as early as cir-cumstances will permit, has had a very salutary effect in checking the feeling of irritation and impatience which were so marked a   month ago , and which might easily have developed into activities causing serious embarrassment to the Government. The present position is, that speaking generally, Muslims await with anxiety the terms of the decision, and are especially concerned in regard to Punjab and Bengal, but provided there is no undue delay in making tho announcement, they
9 &apos;1 p- 2 -they are unlikely to resort to direct action, although they may take such opportunities as offer themselves of bringing pressure to bear.The communal sentiment to which expression was given at the Muslim Conference evoked strong protest in the Hindu and Sikh Press,  and at a few public meetings the Hindu Mahasabha has been fairly active, especially in making a bargain with the Depressed Classes, and   renewed prominence has been given to the old ground of controversy. But, on the whole, the promise of a decision by Government has not resulted in so great an increase in communal activity and feeling as might have been expected.There is some reason to suppose that the problem of Depressed Classes may assume considerable political importance.In the last appreciation, it was said, that although there would be attempts to boycott the elections in the North West Frontier Province, and possibly to use them as an occasion for disturbance, there would seem to be good prospect of the new constitution being introduced without a serious set back. The elections have passed off well, except in that portion of Peshawar District which has always been the strong-hold of the Red-Shirt movement.    In that area, there has been definite recrudes-acquiescence of the movement in which women took a prominent part; there was organised violence, and successful interference with several elections. At the moment, active disorder has subsided, but big demonstrations are being planned against the inauguration of the new constitution on the 20th, and developments are uncertain.-
So far as is known,  the revival is confined to a small area, and unless untoward events occur during the next week, it seems unlikely to spread. Even so, it is a reminder that Red-Shirt movement had gone deep in certain areas.Elsewhere the situation, as regards the Civil Disobedience movement, shows improvement in all Provinces. Although complete figures for March are not yet available, it is certain that they will show a substantial drop in convictions compared with January and February. Several Provinces are able to report that the movement is now exhibiting little activity. This is so in Bengal, Central Provinces and Madras. It continuer on the down-gra.de in the United Provinces , Assam, and Bihar and Orissa. In the Punjab there has been no appreciable increase in activities which have been small since the beginning of the movement. The position in Bombay Presidency may be stated more fully since the past appreciations have not sufficiently emphasised the contrasts between 1930 and 1932.    The outstanding features have been first, very limited activities outside Bombay City and, second, the very restricted scope of the demonstrative side in Bombay City compared with 1930. in the latter year, Bombay City was the storm centre, and large parts of the Province were strong-holds of the movement. The salt campaign reached great intensity in various places. There were many serious clashes with the authorities and the dispersals of crowds were frequent in Bombay City.Whde districts in Gujerat were whole-heartedly with the movement, and the no-revenue campaign assumed
serious proportisns.This year law and order has never been seriously threatened in Bombay City, and there has been no difficulty in dealing with demonstrations.  In the districts activity has been slight, and the response from Gujerat has been sc small as to justify the view that, for the time being at any rate, Congress have lost their hold. These results are mainly attributable to the prompt and vigorous action taken by the Local Government and their officers. The advantages of gaining and maintaining the initiative, which have been successfully achieved in all Provinces, have been specially marked in Bombay, where the dangers of a wide response to the Civil Disobedience programme were particularly great.The improvement in the situation is now more satisfactory since intensive efforts were made during National Week to revive enthusiasm. This was held during the 6th to 13th April, and the programme, while concentrating on boycott of foreign, especially British, goods, included various demonstrations. The reports from the provinces show that, except in a very few towns, the programme evoked practically no enthusiasm. The chief feature of the week was organised and widespread disorder in Allahabad,  in which all pretence of non-violence was thrown aside.With the same object of stimulating flagging interest, the Congress announced their intention of holding their annual session at Delhi about the 23rd April. They were informed that the Government had no intention of allowing them to hold it.   Whether they will attempt to do so is uncertain. The present indications are that they will, at any rate, postpone the attempt until early in
May,  and counsels are divided as to the wisdom of holding it at all.      The decision of the Government has been fully justified by the intentions of the authors of the proposal, as revealed by a confidential circular issued by the acting President of the Congress,  in which it is stated that two out of the three resolutions to be proposed were, first, to reaffirm the Karachi resolution of independence,  and second,  to confirm the resolutions and programme of the Working Committee by which Civil Disobedience was revived in January last.One point may be mentioned in this connection. The decision of the Government has been criticised as illogical because they have not declared Congress,  as a body, an unlawful association.      There is no lack: of logic. The policy pursued by Government is to take measures which,   on balance,  are best calculated to defeat Civil Disobedience. The Congress has a very large membership, and a large number of members are not in active sympathy with the revival of Civil Disobedience but do support its other political aims and activities.    The declaration of Congress as an unlawful body would make all the members liable to prosecution, would offend many who are at least neutral in the struggle and would serve no -useful purpose,  since it would be both impracticable and inexpedient to prosecute a large number of members. \&quot;hen, however,  it is proposed that Congress as a body should endorse unlawful activities, Government,  consistent with their policy, have to take measures to prevent this.      The measures will be those best suited to the purpose, and will not include declaration of Congress as unlawful.The position in regard to the economic boycott shows little change.      It remains the chief feature of the Congress
f) o rjh i) f\,Jprogramme and has achieved considerable success.    This, however, varies from province to province and the effects of Congress activity are very difficult to appraise owing to other factors.      General trade depression,  the recent rise in sterling,  increased Japanese competition owing to Japan going off the gold standard,  are important influences which affect British trade adversely.    Even so,  Congress propaganda and social boycott have undoubtedly had direct effects, which, generally,  are manifest in unwillingness to buy rather than to sell.In this connection,  it is necessary to correct any misapprehension that may have been caused by  the statement in the last appreciation that,  in Bombay city,  Congress had been able to exclude British firms from a large part of both future and ready business.    It is understood that the number of British firms directly boycotted by name is about 7 or 8 only,  that boycott is mainly concerned with the cotton trade,  and that most British firms are doing business although in some cases,  this is of restricted volume owing partly to Congress propaganda,  but mainly to general trade conditions.These appreciations are concerned, more with political than constitutional matters,  and they do not pretend to deal with the latter at any length.     But it cannot be emphasised too often,   or too strongly  that the constitutional and preventive sides of the policy of the Government are very closely connected, and that, of the two,  the first is the most important.      It is not,   in the long run, by preventive action alone that the Government expects to establish the futility of Civil Disobedience.      Extraordinary measures are unavoidable to defeat direct action, which would, without them, create a state of anarchy,  but side by side with them it is essential to press on with constitutional advance, and the
more rapid the progress in this direction the quicker will Civil Disobedience end.      One of the greatest incentives to Civil Disobedience is distrust regarding the intentions of the Government in constitutional fields.      Misrepresentation is still the most effective weapon of Congress, and,  in this particular direction,  the best way to blunt it is by positive proof of intentions.      The weapon is losing its edge. Go far as the educated   are concerned they cannot ignore the signs of the time. During the past month there has been real pro-gress.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the responsibility for a communal decision;  theFederal Finance Committee have finished their report; the Franchise Committee have pressed on with their labours with the co-operation of all but Congress;    elections have been held in the North West Frontier Province and, within a day or two,   the reformed constitution will be inaugurated, and last,  but not least, the Chamber of Princes have declared in favour of federation. These are stubborn facts which are  influencing public opinion and may be expected steadily to undermine the position of Congress.      The key to the problem is expedition in the work of constitutional reform.
