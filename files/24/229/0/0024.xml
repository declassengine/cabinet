Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1932.SECRET. Copy No. 9CP. 124 (32).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I HAVE just received a letter from the High Commissioner, of which an extract is attached. On further consideration he rejects as impracticable the suggestion that we should make a new offer of a Legislative Council, but decline to proceed with the proposal, if the Jews fail to agree.I feel bound to accept Sir A. Wauchope&apos;s estimate of the effect on the Arabs of such a course; he is a shrewd and unprejudiced observer. At the same time I cannot advise the Cabinet to force upon the Jews a Legislature to which they would be bitterly opposed, and which I do not believe would work satisfactorily at the present time.I am therefore of opinion that the wisest course is to adopt Sir A. Wauchope&apos;s second alternative, which gives the same result as that which I hoped ultimately to attain in default of agreement as to the constitution of the Legisla-tive Council. But we must be prepared to face the fact that, while the declared intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to establish a Legislative Council at a fitting time will stand, the High Commissioner &apos;s proposal means definitely going-back for the present on the statements made in 1930 in the White Paper and to the Permanent Mandates Commission last year.P. C.-L.April 5, 1932.Extract from a Letter from Sir A. Wauchope to Sir P. Cunliffe-Lister.March 23, 1932.* ^ ^ ^ ^ $feI HAVE been most guarded in the private conversations I have had with representative leaders touching the question of a Legislative Council. I have started each interview by saying that I have hitherto formed no definite opinions on the subject of local self-government; but, just as I wish to learn the views of people on other questions such as Land Development or the condition of the Fellah, so also do I feel it my duty to learn the opinions of different sections of the people on the question of a Legislative Council, a question which has been so-fully discussed in the past.One result of these private conversations is that I have come to this definite conclusion that to make any sort of offer of a Legislative Council now, and withdraw it on the ground that the Jews would not participate, would have a deplorable effect on all Arab leaders in the country. It would be much less injurious to the prestige of this Government to make no offer at present, rather than risk such an eventuality.To make no offer will cause disappointment and a certain outcry from the Arabs; but I consider these would be neither so bitter nor so formidable to face[6816]
as the feeling if a new offer were..to be made now and it resulted in no Legislative Council being formed....   . .. . .       .The oiunions of the leaders to whom I have spoken are naturally varied, and are, owing to political factors here, in a state of flux. Consequently I should have to push my enquiries more definitely than I have hitherto thought advisable, before I am in a position to tell you what difficulties would face us if it were decided to establish a Legislative Council in which the Jews refused to participate for one reason and the Arab extremists for another.Two courses are open to me : The first is to say that, in order to redeem our pledges, the Government has decided on the establishment of a Legislative Council, and is willing to discuss with representative men the form which that Legislative Council should take, but that no opposition will deter the Government from forming a Legislative Council, partly by election, but, if necessary, by nomination.The second alternative is for me to say quietly to the leaders to whom I have spoken that the Government has given a pledge, and is determined to redeem it. But, before forming a Legislative Council, wre consider that it is advisable to do three things for the good of the country and for the training of responsible people in responsible work : (1) Continue and extend our policy of giving Administrative work to Palestinians by appointing both Arabs and Jews to such Councils as the Agricultural Council;(2) Establish Local Councils and hew Municipal bodies throughout the codritry, probably in 1932;(3) Appoint some Palestinian Members to the Advisory Council in 1932.In furtherance of (1), I have already appointed unofficial members to the Road Board, and shall make siiftilar appointments to the Standing Committee for Commerce and Industry and the Railway Board in the near future, arid I am considering further possibilities in the same direction.*****,*
