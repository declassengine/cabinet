liilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF nlS BRITANNIC iiftAJESTY *S OOVERMkEKl&apos;.gORET. .P. 130  (32)COPY m.CABINE T.COhLs    HOURS DISCUSSIONS.note by the President of the Board of Trade.As a result of meetings between the owners and the Secretary for Mines and myself, and of private representations made to the owners pressing the view that joint meetings and, if possible, agreement between the two sides at the earliest possible moment were of great importance, the owners finally agreed to meet the men.   A me ting took place on Thursday, april 7th, between representatives of the wining Association and of the Miners Federation.   The proceedings were adjourned to enable the parties to report to their respective executives, and no date was fixed for a further meeting.   The executive of the Miners Federation has decided &quot;to await further negotiations and to meet again on 21st April to survey the whole position&quot;..Tnis does not mean that progress is now being made towards agreement.     The owners are not prepared to discuss any form of wages guarantee whatever;    the men will certainly not agree to a continuance of the 7^- hour day for a period (which Is the most they are likely to accept) without some measure of protection for wages.   It will probably be necessary to summon both sides to meet me shortly.d&apos;.R.Board of Trade,12th April, 1932.
