Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1932.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 125 (32).9CABINET.Disarmament Conference, 1932.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the Attitude to be Adopted by the United Kingdom Delegation at the Discussion in the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference.ACCORDING to the agenda, the discussion in the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, which is due to begin on the 11th April, will be divided into two main phases: (A) a discussion of &quot; principles,&quot; and (B) a discussion of &quot; other questions to be studied in connexion with the Headings and Articles of the Draft Convention.&quot; This memorandum deals with the first phase.2.   The main points for discussion under (A) are (l)&quot;the German claim for&apos; &quot; Equality   of   Treatment,&quot;   (2)   the French   thesis   of   &quot; Security,&quot;   and (3) &quot; Qualitative &quot; disarmament.3. (1) is primarily a Franco-German dispute. It is a point that we should probably not wish to raise ourselves at the outset of any disarmament discussion, but as the Germans insist on raising it, and as the French are only too ready to take up the challenge, the controversy is inevitable.4. (2) is the French thesis of &quot; no further disarmament without further security.&quot; It is idle to expect that any discussion on disarmament can take place at Geneva without the French raising this point. Their thesis is supported by their allies and by a number of other smaller States in Europe, e.g., Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Portugal, &amp;c. As we cannot fall in with the French ideas of &quot; security,&quot; we shall have to make our position clear.5. It will be seen that the above points (1) and (2) are really political in their nature.6. In contrast with these political issues comes (3) &quot; qualitative &quot; disarma-ment presented in the form of a complete list by the Italian delegation^   It* The proposal of the Italian delegation was as follows :  Being convinced that the reduction and limitation of armaments contemplated by Article S of the Covenant can be greatly facilitated by the simultaneous application of a quantitative and qualitative limitation,The Italian delegation has the honour to propose that the Conference examine first of all the question of prohibiting all war material of a specifically aggressive character.In this connection the Italian delegation would remind the Conference that it has already-announced its willingness to accept an organised scheme of qualitative limitation covering In the Sphere of Naval Armaments 1. Simultaneous abolition of capital ships and submarines. 2. Abolition of aircraft-carriers.In the Sphere of Land Armaments 1. Abolition of heavy artillery of every kind. 2. Abolition of tanks of every kind.In the Sphere of Air Armaments  Abolition of bombing aircraft.In Every Sphere 1. Abolition of aggressive chemical and bacteriological weapons of every kind. 2. Revision of the laws of war with a view to the more complete and effective protection of the civil population.[6787]   [6830] n
involves either the complete abolition or the reduction in size of specific weapons of warfare. Any steps taken under this head are therefore definite and practical measures of disarmament.7. A brief outline of the probable course of the discussion is given hereunder, with recommendations as to the attitude which might be taken by the United Kingdom delegation.(1) &quot; Equality of Treatment.&quot;8. The Germans will claim that there cannot be two different regimes one rule for the vanquished and another for the victors in the last war. If the Disarmament Convention does not impose on all Signatories the same kind of restrictions and prohibitions, the Germans will not sign it.9. -Now article 53 of the Draft Disarmament Convention provides : &quot; The present Convention shall not affect the provisions of previous Treaties under which certain of the High Contracting Parties have agreed to limit their land, sea or air armaments, and have thus fixed in relation to one another their respective rights and obligations in this connexion.&apos;&apos; And the article goes on to provide in effect that States like France only agree to limit their armaments to the figures to be set out in other clauses of the Convention on the clear under-standing that the words above quoted are &quot; an essential condition&quot; for the observance of the Convention. The language of article 53 is wide and vague enough to refer to the Washington and London Treaties, but the real sting of it is that it is meant to cover Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. The German delegation, when the Draft Convention was discussed, objected to article 53 on this ground, stating that &quot; to accept it would be tantamount to a renewal of the German signature to the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles.&quot;10. We are thus in the presence of a dilemma. France declares that she will not sign a Disarmament Convention unless Germany remains bound by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. Germany declares that she will not accept a Convention under which she is treated as bound by a different system of rules from the rules which apply to other people. Dr. Briining, on the second day of the general discussion at Geneva, said &quot; the German people looks to the present Conference to solve the problem of general disarmament on the basis of equal rights and equal security for all peoples,&quot; and when Germany&apos;s formal proposi-tions were put in they included the following : &quot; In submitting these proposals to the Conference, the German delegation wish to make it clear that the German Government cannot accept a Convention unless its provisions are equally applicable to Germany and to other signatory countries.&quot;It is plain, therefore, that the Germans will not sign a Convention if it contains anything like article 53, Avhich ties them down specifically to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. They claim either that the same restrictions should be placed on all alike, or, failing this, that they should be released from the restrictions which are not imposed on others. For instance, either all other States must give up military aviation or the Germans must be allowed some aircraft they profess privately that they would be content with a merely nominal number.11. In support of this claim, the Germans quote the Preamble to the Military Clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, the Clemenceau covering letter, and the Final Act of Locarno. They maintain that their disarmament was part of a bargain; that they have fulfilled their part and that the other Governments have not fulfilled theirs.12. The French will deny that there is any sort of a bargain, and they will maintain that the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles must not be relaxed. Moreover, they will say that if there has been any breach of agreement it is the Germans who are guilty, and they will allege a number of infractions of the Treatv.
13. While the best moment for our intervention remains to be chosen, it will be impossible for the United Kingdom Delegation to abstain altogether from this discussion. It is true that it is none of our seeking, for it is French resistance to the claim of Germany Avhich brings it to the front. But both sides will appeal to us, directly or indirectly, and there is no reason why we should not express our opinion frankly, and at the same time endeavour to exercise a moderating influence, if the United Kingdom Delegation is definitely instructed as to the attitude it should take up.14. The following conclusions on this head are suggested for considera-tion : (a) A distinction must be drawn between the legal contention that, in the events which have happened, Germany is discharged from observing Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany&apos;s moral claim for reconsideration in view of the preamble to Part V, the Clemenceau letter, and her subsequent admission to the League. Without admitting that Germany is released from Part V on the ground that the subsequent condition of corresponding disarmament by others has not been fulfilled (for who could define what degree of disarmament by others would fulfil such a condition ?), it may well be conceded that an expectation of more rapid disarmament by others was created, whereas, in fact, while Germany has been bound by a fixed limit, no corresponding reduction has taken place in other countries.   The moral claim of Germany is very strong.(b) Equality in the method of treatment is not the same thing as equality in the figure of armaments. Germany&apos;s claim for relief in point of status will evoke the greatest degree of sympathy if she does not seek to increase the sum total of her armaments.(c) On this basis we should search for a means of meeting Germany&apos;s claim-to improved status. If our proposals for the abolition of certain weapons of war,, which Germany under Part V of the Treaty is not permitted to have, are adopted, this will tend towards a greater equalisation in the amount of armaments. For the rest, very large adjustments cannot be made suddenly.(d) The best mode of carrying out the above principles would seem to be for the limits of German armaments, as laid down in Part V, to be expressed as. Germany&apos;s maxima, in the same articles of the Disarmament Convention and by the same methods, as are adopted in the case of other Powers. This goes far to meet Germany&apos;s grievance in point of status. It is true that it will leave, in all probability, a great disparity in figures, but the principle of equality of treatment would be established.(e) One result, which would not be palatable to France, would be that when the Disarmament Convention expires by effluxion of time (say, in seven or ten years), Germany would be released from limits which were imposed on her by the Armistice, and would be free to put forward higher figures in the discussion for a new Convention. (This view is contrary to the Spanish contention, according to which limits fixed as the result of the present Disarmament Conference, though only fixed for a period of years, can never be exceeded hereafter, without the concurrence of the Council of the League. See, however, as to this, D.C. (M) (32) 5.)(/) If the British delegation takes the line above suggested, it will not give satisfaction to either France or Germany, but that is the inevitable result of taking up a middle position. Moreover, the line suggested has this to commend it. It meets the claim for equality of status in the only way in which it can be met without giving Germany leave to re-arm. By so doing, it is calculated to earn the sympathy, and perhaps the support, of some other nations. If the line proposed is approved, discreet enquiries might be made as to whether the United States would not take up a similar attitude.(g) There is one obvious objection which must be faced. By affirming that Part V of the Treaty of Versailles is binding upon Germany while at the same time suggesting a new mode of treatment, we shall be necessarily indicating to France that the breakdown of the Disarmament Conference will rivet Part V of the Treaty upon Germany. But there is no way of securing that France will exert herself to make a success of the Disarmament Conference on terms which are reasonable to Germany, unless, indeed, Britain is prepared to make an adequate contribution to France under the head of security.[6787] b 2
(2) &quot; Security.&apos;&apos;15. The French &quot; thesis of security &quot; really amounts to a demand for the adoption of the system of the Geneva protocol of 1924 or something like it. This demand was formulated in the French Memorandum of the 17th July last, and its acceptance is the basis upon which the French Memorandum of the 5th February was put forward. As for the former of these documents, see CP. 322 (31), where it is analysed on pages 3 and 4, and where the Cabinet was invited to consider what was the British answer to the French claim for security. The Cabinet then decided that a Memorandum should be prepared on the British position in relation to European policy and in the meantime recorded, as the trend of Cabinet opinion, that the Cabinet were not prepared to enter into some form of a guarantee over and above Locarno under which, in conceivable circum-stances, British forces might be engaged in a war on the Continent of Europe, e.g., m respect of the Eastern frontier of Germany. The memorandum on the British position in relation to European policy was circulated as a Most Secret document marked CP. 4 (32), and the latter part of it contains a number of suggestions, which, with one exception, have never been considered in detail. The exception is the suggestion of a Mediterranean Locarno, which was subsequently examined and rejected.16. The situation therefore is that the only instruction which the United Kingdom delegation has received for dealing with the French claim for security is a blank negative. We are prepared to stand by our present commitments, which are contained in the Locarno Treaty or in the Covenant, and we are not prepared to accept any new or additional obligations. There appears to be no other course, both because of the unwillingness of British public opinion to commit itself with precision in advance in respect of undefined contingencies, and because of the strong disapproval of the Dominions. It ought, however, to be realised that a blank negative to the French thesis (though not presumably unexpected by France), especially if it follows upon the endorsement of - Germany&apos;s thesis of equality of treatment, is bound to impose a severe strain on the cordiality of AngloJ^rench relations. Without French support, the Dis-armament Conference cannot succeed, and France has indicated in the most emphatic terms that she cannot give it without further security. It therefore becomes a matter of the greatest difficulty and delicacy to determine the line which the British delegation must follow in this branch of the discussions.17. While rejecting the French thesis, the following considerations suggest themselves as worth bearing in mind, though some of them cannot be publicly urged with much effect, and it is urgently to be hoped that they can be supplemented by other useful suggestions : (a) The latest French memorandum of the 5th February does not formulate the plans for security which France has in mind. Indeed, the memorandum, after elaborating plans placing civil aviation and bombing aircraft at the disposal of the League, and for the creation of an international force, goes on to say : &quot; The measures without which the above proposals would be ineffective, and even unthinkable, include, amongst others, compulsory arbitration; definition of the aggressor; guarantees as to the rapidity of the decision of the authority controlling the international force; the bringing of the action of that authority into conformity with international law, which is still insufficiently precise, but the permanent and contractual elements of which result from international treaties and pacts; and the international control of the execution of all agreements concerning armaments.&quot; These provisions, in regard to which the French delegation reserves the right to make concrete proposals, ai*e an integral part of the enquiries carried out by the League of Nations during the last twelve years. All the elements of the necessary solution are brought together.....&quot;It will, therefore, be reasonable to ask in the first place that the authors of the French plan should formulate more precisely these essential proposals upon which, according to them, the whole French claim depends.(&apos;&amp;) The criticisms of the French plan for endowing the League of Nations with an international force are really subsidiary to this, but there is most effective
material for the purpose in Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s Paper No. D.C. (M) (32) 4. See also Part 2 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum on the Disarmament Conference CP. 78 (32) which summarises the French claim and makes some criticisms.(c) We should refuse to subscribe to the proposition that further disarma-ment is impossible without further security. , The Assembly in 1928 adopted a resolution, which the French joined in, to the effect that the then existing degree, of security was sufficient to warrant a degree of disarmaments We might ask France and her allies whether they really feel apprehensive as to the safety of their frontiers, and we need not, if necessary, refrain from quoting figures of military strength.(d) If it is alleged, in reply, that the frontiers of certain States in Europe, e.g., Poland and Roumania, are insecure, it by no means follows that the only form of security is a general undertaking like the Geneva protocol. The only form of security supplementary to that in the Covenant which has been effectually set up is the Locarno Treaty, and our objection to world-wide commitments does not mean that we should oppose regional guarantees between States on the Continent of Europe to meet their special anxieties, whether on the Locarno model or by the local application of more elaborate machinery such as that of the protocol for identifying the aggressor, etc.(e) It would be a matter for consideration whether, without joining in any new regional arrangement, we should be prepared to undertake to give no assistance to the party which is the &quot; aggressor.&quot; This raises difficulties in defining or identifying the aggressor, and also raises the question whether the United States would be prepared to give a similar assurance. Even if the &quot;United States felt unable to give such an assurance in advance, our example would make it very difficult for her to do otherwise when the time came.&quot;(/) While refusing to enter into new engagements in the name of security, we should emphasise that we recognise that we are bound by the engagements we had already entered into, viz., Locarno and the Covenant. Our refusal to go further is based on a situation which has not changed since 1924, viz., our inability to assume unlimited liability in every quarter of the world in quite unforeseeable circumstances.(g) We must emphasise our belief that the future of the League depends on the extent to which it succeeds in concentrating and formulating the public opinion of the world with a view to keeping the peace, and that we cannot embrace the conception of a super-State whose normal function is that of. the international policeman. This, it would be observed, is a direct challenge to the French thesis, eg., &quot;In future we must seek in common action that security which each nation has hitherto endeavoured to obtain from its own forcesalone.....The present Conference offers the best opportunity that has everoccurred to make a definite choice between a League of Nations possessing executive authority and a League of Nations paralysed by the uncompromising attitude of national sovereignty France has made her choice. She suggests that the other nations should make theirs.&quot;18. Up to the present, there lias been very little cut-and-dried criticism at Geneva of the French thesis. Soviet Russia ridiculed it and Italy indicated some reasoned disapproval. It is difficult to suppose that America would be in favour of such a plan, though the plan is not designed to include non-Members of the League, at any rate so far as an international force is concerned. But the out-standing fact is that the more effective the criticism of the French plan turns out to be, the more difficult will it be to secure any practical progress towards disarmament, for France has made it quite plain that unless her plan is accepted she is not willing to disarm.(3) &quot;Qualitative&quot; Disarmament.19. On the two preceding points our attitude must be somewhat negative. -On the question of qualitative disarmament we can be more positive, and the* 18th Meeting of the Assembly, September 25th, 1928.
proposals already formally put in by the United Kingdom Delegation^ include certain measures for the abolition of specified weapons.20. Qualitative disarmament has much to recommend it. If carried out on a considerable scale, it would be drastic and impressive; it would result in an immediate saving of expenditure; it might involve the disappearance of the more modern, more deadly and more indiscriminate weapons; it avoids all the thorny questions of &quot;ratios,&quot; which involve national prestige; it would constitute an approach to &quot;equality of treatment.&quot;21. Proposals in this field have been made by various Delegations for the abolition of heavy artillery, tanks, capital ships, aircraft carriers, submarines,, bombing aircraft and even military aviation altogether.22. We ourselves have proposed the abolition of heavy mobile land-guns and submarines, and we have also urged &apos;&apos; the practical examination of the whole problem of bombing from the air in its widest possible form.&quot; We have also pronounced in favour of reducing the size of men-of-war and the calibre of the guns carried by them.23. The abolition of tanks, to which we have not subscribed, has been advocated by a number of Delegations : Austria, China, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands (if one may so interpret the abolition of &quot;specially offensive&quot; weapons), Spain, Sweden, Turkey, U.S.S.R. and the United States.24. In view of this strong body of opinion in favour of the abolition of tanks, it is a matter for grave consideration whether we ought to resist the proposal. Paragraph 67 of the Report of the Cabinet Committee on preparation for the Disarmament Conference (C.P. 5 (32)) ran as follows : &quot; The War Office have pointed out that they are not in favour of any attempt to abolish or restrict tanks on the grounds that the tank is definitely a life-saving weapon, and also that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible,, to define a tank or to differentiate between tanks and armoured lorries or armoured machines of all kinds. They urge that, if limitation of tanks is proposed, then also logically a limitation must be put forward for machine guns, to which the tank is the ansAver, because the machine gun is the weapon which predominates the battlefield to-day.&quot;I have already pointed out to the Cabinet (CP. 78 (32), paragraph 10) how difficult it would be to contend at Geneva that tanks are weapons of defence. A layman might venture to put forward the view that they are par excellence weapons of attack. They are the answer to the machine gun precisely, because machine guns will other wise hold up an attack. If machine guns survive, but tanks are abolished, the difficulty of advancing across an entrenched position will be greatly increased. Further instructions to the United Kingdom delegation seem, therefore, to be needed on this matter, and in particular, if we are to continue to be in favour of tanks, the deputation should be provided with argu-ments calculated to justify this attitude at the Disarmament Conference.25. The question of aviation presents a number of difficulties. I am asked to include in this Paper &quot; definite recommendations as to our attitude towards proposals to abolish bombing and bombing aircraft.&quot;* The United Kingdom proposal was as follows :  The United Kingdom delegation, while of opinion that the draft Convention provides the best groundwork on which to proceed, suggests that special attention should be directed to such prohibitions or limitations as will weaken the attack and so remove temptation for aggression, and to methods o  warfare which are specially liable to cause injury to non-combatants. In-particular, it suggests (without attempting to draw up anything in the nature of an exhaustive list) that the following questions should be closely studied, with a view to the adoption of such proposals as may seem practicable  1. The most practicable course for limiting the number of effectives.2. The prohibition of mobile land guns above a certain calibre.3. The abolition (and prohibition) of subnnarines as a humanitarian measure.4. Consideration of the most practical method of reducing the size of men-of-war and the maximum calibre of guns carried by them.5. The practical examination of the whole problem of bombing from the air in its widest possible form.The United Kingdom delegation attaches great importance to the maintenance of the provisions of the draft Convention relating to gas and bacteriological warfare, and of those providing for the establishment of a Permanent Disarmament Commission.
26. Total abolition of military aviation has been advocated by Denmark, Germany, Hejaz, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.27. Total abolition is an ideal that probably cannot be realised, if only on account of the danger which resides in civil aviation. The Air Commission has been instructed to work out a scheme of internationalisation of civil aircraft, if by any chance this should prove to give any guarantee of the real international Ownership and control of civil machines, the question of the abolition of military aviation might be further considered; it would certainly afford the simplest remedy.2b.   Short of total abolition, the following proposals have been made : Austria. &quot; The abolition of bombing from aircraft.&quot; Belgium. &quot; The prohibition of bombing aircraft.&quot; China. The abolition of &quot; bombing aeroplanes.&quot;France. Bombing machines over a certain size to be handed over to the League.Hungary. &quot;Abolition of aeroplanes (particularly bombing planes).&quot; Italy. &quot;Abolition of bombing aircraft.&quot;Latvia. &quot; Prohibit the employment of bombs dropped from the air.&quot; Portugal. Suppression of bombing aircraft. Switzerland. Abolition of &quot; bombing aeroplanes.&quot;U.S.S.R. All air bombs to be destroyed and all special appliances for thedischarge of bombs must be removed from aircraft. 29.   The following delegations have endeavoured at least to lay down rules for the protection of the civil population against aerial bombardment : Czechoslovakia. &apos;.&apos; Prohibition of bombardment from the air of the civil population.&quot;France.-Restriction of the&apos;area in which bombing is allowed. Haiti. Abolition of &quot; bombardment from the air of civil populations.&quot; Japan. &quot; Prohibition of the air bombardment of cities and towns.&quot; Netherlands. &quot; Prohibition of the use of destructive war appliances againstthe civil population, particularly the prohibition of air bombardment.&quot; Roumania. &quot; Prohibition of the employment of bombing planes againstopen towns and the civil population.&quot; Stuitzerland. &quot;Prohibition of bombardment from the air.&quot; United States. &quot; Measures to protect the civil population against aerialbombing.&apos;&apos;30. It will thus be seen that a large number of delegations amongst them some of the more important have given their attention to the threat of military aviation.31. The following proposals in connexion with bombing have to be considered :  (a) Prohibit by Convention the possession of bombing aeroplanes, just as it is proposed to prohibit submarines.(b) Prohibit by Convention military aeroplanes of every sort. This alterna-tive has been suggested because of the view that (a) would not be practicable inasmuch as bombs might be dropped from military machines which are not specifically bombing machines.(c) Internationalize civil aviation. This proposal is put forward because (b) would not necessarily prevent bombing in war-time if a State could use civil machines for the purpose of dropping bombs. What exactly is meant by inter-nationalizing civil aviation may be difficult to say, for the point to be secured must be that civil machines cannot be used in time of war by a combatant State for bombing purposes and in view of a State&apos;s power to requisition and other circumstances, this seems a very difficult result to bring about.(d) Abolish flying. This heroic remedy is suggested because of the difficulty of making (c) effective.32. The considerations set out in the previous paragraph seem to show that if a practical remedy is to be found, it must be sought in another direction. Is it possible, instead of seeking to prohibit a class of machine, to prohibit a class of act?   In other words, we must consider as a further alternative (e) Prohibit by international Convention the dropping of bombs from the air. This was in fact one of the provisions of The Hague Convention before the War.
If this Convention was observed, it would at any rate prevent bombing. But the objection is taken in some quarters that it would be going too far to try to prohibit all bombing, and in particular that bombing on military objectives should be permitted, and that the dropping of bombs in areas like the North-West Frontier and the Hinterland of Aden is a civilising and persuasive process. We therefore have two further variants to consider, viz. : (/) Prohibit the dropping of bombs save on military objectives with regula-tions designed to define these objectives or otherwise to limit injury to civilians,. e.g., by giving motice.(g) Prohibit the dropping of bombs by one State on the territory or shipping of another sovereign State.Bomb-dropping in violation of the above restrictions would be declared to be proof that the dropper was an aggressor.33. The above list of alternatives makes it evident that there is no easy and satisfactory line to be taken. At the same time, the United Kingdom delegation will be in a most unhappy position if, while so many other States are loudly declaring that they are prepared to outlaw bombing or prohibit bombing machines, it has nothing positive to say. From the point of view of the delegation at Geneva, the course which presents least difficulty would be to advocate the prohibition of the dropping of bombs on the territory of another State.34. The minute which requested that this paper should be prepared indicated that the subject of Budgetary Limitation should also be discussed. The Chancellor of the Exchequers paper (D.C. (M) (32) (3)) sets out some of the arguments against it, and the strength of these arguments must be admitted. The Home Secretary was one of the Ministers who could not be present at the-earlier discussion, and he has formulated some important considerations in the other direction.   They are as follows :  &quot; Budgetary limitation has been recommended by the Preparatory Commission of the League of Nations after prolonged investigation. The Committee of Experts, appointed by that Commission, has declared that the practical difficulties could be overcome. While unsuitable as a method of comparison between the expenditures of different countries, it might not be unsuitable as a means of comparison between the expenditures of the same country at different dates. The difficulty arising from variations in the value of currency, while undoubtedly real and serious, might perhaps be surmounted by the methods proposed by the Committee of Experts. As to the probable requirements of our own Service Departments for increases on our present estimates, that must necessarily depend upon what is done in other countries. It would be no strengthening of our defences if an increase of, say,  30,000,000 in our estimates were followed straightaway by a similar increase in other people&apos;s, and if the old game of beggar-my-neighbour were resumed. Not least important, there is reason to think that the American attitude towards War Debts is closely linked with the question of European limitation of armament expenditure; that one of the governing considerations in the United States is that the average tax-payer does not see why he should forego monies due to him especially when his own Treasury is faced by an enormous deficit if the debtor Governments are to be free to spend the money they have saved upon a renewal of the race of armaments. For the Disarmament Conference to reject altogether any question of Budgetary Limitation would be likely to stiffen very considerably the American attitude of unwillingness to allow the question of War Debts to be reopened.&quot;I think the subject requires reconsideration by the Cabinet Committee as a whole. I would only add the observation that whereas Budgetary Limitation is in the nature of a cross-check in other cases, there is one case in which it is the only practicable means of limitation at all. This is in the case of land material. If, therefore, there is to be no expenditure limit for land material, there can be no-limit whatever.J. S.March 31, 1932.o
