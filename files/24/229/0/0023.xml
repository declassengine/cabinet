A P P E IT D I..JC.Despatch, from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Minister for External Affairs, Irish Free StatesDowning Street, April 9th, 19 32.Sir,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKiiigdom. have received your despatch Na, 59 of the5th April, and have read its terms with deep regret.2.      The views expressed in your despatch go far beyond the issues originally raised, whichwere - the relationship to the Treaty Settlement of1921 of the provisions of Article 1? of the IrishFree State Constitution dealing with the Parliamen-tary Oath of Allegiance, and the question of theLand Annuities,.      The terms of the despatch make itclear that these points are but a part of a farwider issue, and that what is actually raised is nothing less than a repudiation.of the settlement of1921 as a whole,,3S     His Majesty&apos;s Government in. the UnitedKingdom could certainly not accept the sweepingstatement in paragraph 3 af your despatch ,, but they
feel that nothing is to he gained by reviving the unhappy memories&apos; of a bygone paot0      His Majesty&apos;a Government in the United Kingdom entered into the 1921 Settle-ment with the single desire that it should end the long period of bitterness between the two countries a:;d it is their belief that the Settlement has brought a measure of peace and contentment which could not have been reached by any other means.    Further, as the direct result of that Settlement,  the Irish Free State has participated in and contributed to the notable constitutional developments of the last few years, whereby the position of the Dominions as equal Herberts with the Unired Kingdom of the British Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown, has been
4. It is true that the 1921 Settlement did not result in the establishment of a united Ireland, but the Treaty itself made the necessary provision for the union at that time of the two parts of Ireland if both had then - been ready to accept it.    As to the future, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom feel it sufficient to state that, in their opinion there can be no conceivable hope for the establishment of a united Ireland except on the basis that its allegiance to the Crown and its membership of the British Commonwealth will continue unimpaired.5. As regards the expressed determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State to introduce a   Bill immediately for the removal of Article 17 of the Constitution, and for such consequential changes as may be required to make the removal effective, His Majesty^s Government
in the United Kingdom adhere absolutely tothe view stated in my despatch Ho. 69 ofMarch 23rd that the Oath is an integral part of the Treaty Settlement.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom have publicly indicated on many occasloin the most formal and emphatic manner, thatthey stand absolutely by the TreatySettlement and to this position theymost firmly adhere.
6. With regard to the Latd. Annuities, H.M. Government inthe United Kingiem are at a loss tei understand the statement that your Government are not aware of any such &quot;formal and explicit under-taxiing&quot; as was referred to in my Despatch of the 23rd March.In the first place His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that, in order te avoid misunderstending it is desirable te place on record the origin and nature of the Irish Land Annuities.    These are net payments from Government to Government.    In principle the main transaction is not one between the  two Governments at all, but.between the Irish tenant-purchaser and the holder of the Land Stock which is, of course, held both in Great Britain and in the Irish Free State.    The position is&apos; that the annuities are collected by the Irish free State Government from the tenant-purchasers and are distributed through the National Debt Commissioners to the holders of the Stock.    The Irish Land Annuities are therefore in effect payments on the instalment system by the Irish tenant for the land which he has bought, which pass through the hands both of the Irish Free State Finance Ministry and cf the National Debt Cemmiosieners, and are ultimately received by the holder of Irish Land Stock.7.        Such is the nature of the Land Annuities.    The formal and explicit under takings referred to in my Despatch of the 23rd March are as follows.
&apos; On the 12th February, 1923, a Financial Agreement was signed on behalf of the British Govern-ment and en behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, which, inter alia, laid down the policy to be pursued in regard to completed and pending agreements for the purchase of land in the Irish Free Stateo The first two paragraphs of the Agreement read as follows:-&quot;Is      The Free State Government undertake to pay at agreed intervals to the appropriate fund the full amount of the annuities accruing due from time to  time, making themselves responsible for the - actual collection from the tenant-purchaser-c 8*      The security for such payments shall be - primarily a Free State guarantee fund similar to that -under existing legislation, and, secondarily, the central fund of the Irish Free State&quot;
This undertaking was confirmed in the &quot;Heads of the Ultimate Financial Settlement between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State&quot; which was signed on behalf of the British Government  and on behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, on the 19th March, 1926, and discussed in the Dail Bireann on the 8th December, 1926.The first Head of this Settlement reads as follows : -&quot;The Government of the Irish Free State under-take to pay to the British Government at agreed intervals the full amount of the annuities accruing due from time to time under the Irinh Land Acts 1891 - 1909 without any deduction whatsoever whether on account of Income Tax or otherwise.&quot; As stated in my despatch of 25sd March His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom regard undertakings of this character as binding in law and honour on the Irish Free State, whatever administration
may he in power,  in exactly the same way as the Treaty Itself is &quot;binding on both countries.,8,     I would state in conclusion that it is the sincere hope and desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that friendly relations between the peoples of the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State should continue,:      But in their view those relations cannot but be impaired by any failure in the complete fulfilment of obligations deliberatelyundertaken,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient humble servant, (Signed) Jd H.  THOMAS -
