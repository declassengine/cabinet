This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1932.SECRET.Copy No.    9CJP. 106 (32).THE CABINET.THE ARMY AND AIR FORGE (ANNUAL) BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill. 1102. The passing of the Statute of Westminster has necessitated a large number of General amendments to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom 4617 is not purporting to legislate for a Dominion in respect of which the Statute is operative. These detailed amendments are contained in Part I of a second Schedule to the Bill (the first Schedule dealing with billeting rates as usual). Similarly in Part II of this Schedule are collected the necessary amendments to omit references to &quot; Ireland &quot; as a whole and to make it clear that the Act refers only to Northern Ireland. Opportunity has been taken to insert in a separate part (Part III) of this Schedule a number of minor amendments in detailed wording, mostly of a purely drafting-character. The only point in this Schedule to which 1 need draw the attention of my colleagues is the new section 187c on page 17 of the Bill. It carries out a request of the Government of New Zealand that, as it has not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster, it is necessary to provide that for the time being the Army Act shall continue to apply to its forces in the same way as it in fact applies to the forces of a Colony. Australia and Newfoundland which are in the same position as New Zealand in this respect have notified their concurrence in this provision.3. Apart from the second Schedule the only Clause in the Bill to which I need invite attention is Clause 7. This substitutes new wording for the existing Section 174a of the Army and Air Force Acts, which deals with the exemption of recreation rooms managed or conducted under authority of a Secretary of State or the Admiralty from the necessity of obtaining licences. The amendment will establish beyond all doubt that entertainments under the direct control of the Service authorities are exempt from the Sunday Observance Act and from the Cinematograph Acts of 1909, 1922 and 1927 so far as regards the using of premises for the purpose of such entertainments. The Home Secretary in notifying that he had no remarks to offer on the draft Clause, presumed that the policy involved would be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.4. The Bill, as my colleagues are aware, must receive the Royal Assent by the end of April, and I would ask their concurrence in the circulation of the Bill at the earliest opportunity.H.The Wak Office,18* March, 1932.(B32/8)   70   3/32   W.O.P.   6092
Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause 4.Subsection (IB) of S. 114 of the Army Act (which was inserted in 1919) enables the Army Council to pre-pare at such intervals as they consider necessary a list of horses available in case of emergency and, for this purpose, authorises them to inspect horses with a view to determining their usefulness for different purposes. The subsection is quite distinct from the original provisions of the section which dated from a period when in peace time units without much transport moved from station to station by road. This older part of the section enables annual lists to be made out of persons liable to supply horses and carriages on hire for temporary purposes. Such a list must he deposited for public inspection and can be appealed against, and, subject to such appeal, a constable can without orders from a magistrate requisition horses and carriages from it. Under modern conditions the annual preparation of such a formal public list would entail unnecessary expense and, if on a rare occasion transport is required, it can be requisitioned under S. 113 by application direct to a magistrate. All that the Army Council reqiiire as respects horses is such a periodical census as is provided for by subsection (IB) : as regards carriages in general, no list is required; but for use, should a serious emergency arise, it is necessary to have available a list of motor vehicles, and the object of the present clause is to extend to such vehicles the existing pro-visions relating to horses.Subsection (3) is a purely drafting amendment. In 1919 the neAV provisions were inserted in the middle of the section, and advantage is now taken of the oppor-tunity to rearrange the various subsections in more logical order.Subsection (4) adds a definition of &quot; trailer.&quot; 40-10 A
Clause 5.S. 115 of the Army Act deals with the requisitioning of vehicles and horses in case of emergency; and, inter alia, provides that where any vehicle or horse is so requisitioned, the owner may be required to deliver it  at the expense of the Government in the case of a motor-car or other locomotive, at any distance up to 100 miles from his premises, and in the case of any other vehicle or horse, up to 10 miles from his premises. Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) substitutes for the phrase &quot; motor-car or other locomotive &quot; the words &quot; mechanically propelled carriage or trailer,&quot; thus making it clear that where a &quot; trailer &quot; is requisitioned, delivery of it may be required at the same distance from the premises of the owner as would be the case if it were itself mechanically pro-pelled. Paragraph (b) deals with the case of an emergency so serious as to justify the calling out of the army reserve and the requisitioning of vehicles for purchase as distinct from hire for temporary purposes. In the case of purchase, the distance up to which delivery of mechanically propelled vehicles and trailers can be required at the public expense is increased from 100 miles (which might not in some case cover transit to a port of embarkation) to 250 miles.Clause 6.Under s. 132 of the Army Act, it is in times of peace the function of the Secretary of State (or, in India, of the Governor-General) to set apart buildings to be used as military prisons or detention barracks, and to make rules with respect to them; but s. 133 provides that &quot; in any country in which operations against the enemy are being conducted,&quot; the Commander-in-Chief of the forces in the field may exercise these powers. It is arguable, on the section as it at present stands, that on the cessation of actual hostilities, the powers so vested in the Commander-in-Chief come to an end, with the result that the buUdings appointed by him immediately cease to be regular detention barracks or prisons, and that the rules made by him cease to have effect. To avoid this difficulty, the clause provides that the powers of the Commander-in-Chief shall continue so long as his troops remain &quot; on active service,&quot; thus giving the necessary time for permanent arrangements to be made on a peace-time basis.
Clause 7.S. 174A of the Army Act exempts recreation rooms managed or conducted under the authority of the Secretary of State or the Admiralty from any necessity for a music and dancing licence under the Disorderly Houses Act, 1751, or the similar enactments in force in various parts of the country, or for a stage-play licence under the Theatres Act, 1843. Doubts have been felt as to whether these service recreation rooms are affected by certain other enactments relating to public enter-tainments, or whether the general principle that the Crown is not bound by a statute unless expressly mentioned exempts them. It has been thought better to make it clear (a) that the existing exemption extends to all the enactments in question but (b) that it is restricted to entertainments under the direction and control of an officer or committee officially responsible and does not cover a building which, with the approval of the military authorities, is hired out to an entertain-ments contractor.Clause 8.The new section which it is proposed to insert in the Army Act will enable an officer or soldier who is for the time being subject to military law, to be attached, for instructional purposes or otherwise, to a force of any of the Dominions, and provides that while so attached, he shall be subject to the military law of the Dominion in question. Except in time of war, a person is not to be so attached without his consent.The section, coupled with consequential minor amendments made by Part I of the Second Schedule, will give effect on the part of the United Kingdom to mutual arrangements arising out of the Statute of Westminster with respect to the temporary lending and borrowing of personnel.Clause 9.The amendments which this clause will make in the Army Act are explained in the notes to the Second Schedule.40 A 2
Clause 10.The effect of this clause is to make in the Air Force Act similar amendments to those made in the Army Act by the preceding clauses of Part II, subject to exceptions and modifications rendered necessary by the fact that certain clauses of the Army Act have no counter-parts in the Air Force Act and that the phraseology of the two Acts is not in all cases identical.&apos;   Clause 11.When a soldier, seaman or airman is attached to one of the other services, he becomes subject temporarily to the code which governs that service. As regards discipline and command, this is necessary; but it is administratively inconvenient that as regards his obligation to maintain his wife and children (if any) he should during different periods be subject to different statutory provisions. It is proposed that in future a member of any one of the three services shall throughout his career remain subject as regards this matter to the code which became applic-able to him on his first enlistment. Paragraph (h) of the amendment (coupled with a consequential amendment made by subsection (2) ) makes provision accordingly in the case of an airman attached temporarily to the Army by leaving him subject at all times to s. 145 of the Air Force Act.Paragraph (i) also deals with the position of an air force officer or airmen who is attached to the Army, Section 179a of the Army Act provides that that Act shall apply to such an attached officer or airman, subject to certain modifications ; but it does not provide explicitly that it shall apply to him as if he were a member of the regular forces. Doubts have in consequence arisen as to whether certain sections (as to &quot; pay&quot; and &quot; exemptions &quot;) which use the phrase &quot; officer (soldier) of the regular forces &quot; apply to him. The object of the amendment is to make it clear that, subject to necessary minor modifica-tions, the sections in question apply to him-as if he were for the time being a member of the regular army.Clause 12.Under sections 182 and 183 of the Army Act, the Army Council can reduce a warrant officer or non-commissioned officer to a lower grade or to the ranks and
concurrent powers in this respect are vested (a) as respects forces serving in India, in the Commander-in-Chief, or an officer appointed by him with the approval of the Governor-General, and (6) as respects forces on active service, in the Commander-in-Chief, or any general officer or brigadier specially appointed for the purpose. In the case of forces serving outside the United Kingdom and India, otherwise than on active service, all cases have to be referred to the Army Council, which entails undesirable delay. The object of the clause is to confer jurisdiction on the officer commanding any force outside the United Kingdom and India provided that he is not below the rank of Major-General, and is appointed for the purpose by the Army Council.Clause 13.Subsection (1). This subsection is complementary to clause 11 (1) (h). Coupled with a consequential amendment made by subsection (3), it secures that airmen when attached temporarily to the navy will remain subject to the Air Force Act so far as regards maintenance of wives and children.Subsection (2). Paragraph (i) deals similarly with soldiers and seamen attached temporarily to the air force and provides that for the purposes referred to above, they shall remain subject to those provisions of the Army Act or Naval Discipline Act, as the case may be, which relate to the maintenance of wives and children. Paragraph (j) corresponds with clause 11 (1 )(i) and makes it clear that sections 136-144 of the Air Force Act apply to temporarily attached naval and military officers, seamen and soldiers as if they were for the time being members of the regular air force.Clause 14.The amendments which this clause will make in the Air Force Act are either drafting amendments or amend -ments corresponding to amendments made in the Army Act by Schedule II, Part III. They are included in a separate schedule instead of in Part III of Schedule II in order to avoid the somewhat elaborate modifications which would have been required in consequence of the differences in phraseology between the two Acts.
Clause 15.This clause is mere consolidation. It collects into one clause provisions which are now to be found in five different sections of five different Acts. The existing provisions will be repealed by Schedule IV.SECOND SCHEDULE.Part I.The passing of the Statute of Westminster renders necessary, or desirable, a number of amendments, most of which fall into three or four well defined categories.(i) &quot;His Majesty&apos;s forces&quot;: It is necessary to make it clear that in those sections of the Army Act which impose duties or liabilities on &quot; the forces&quot; the Parliament at Westminster is not legislating for Dominion forces (see amendment to s. 190 (7)); on the other hand, there are a number of sections where the word &quot; forces &quot; must still continue to have a wide meaning e.g., pro-visions as to acts imperilling &quot; the success of His Majesty&apos;s forces&quot;; see amendments to ss. 4, 6, 7, 23, 163.(ii) Similarly it is desirable, if not necessary, to modify certain sections which might be read as imposing duties or conferring powers on, or as derogating from the powers of, the courts or civil authorities of a Dominion; see amendments to ss. 41, 94, 126, .129. In particular, it is necessary to modify the sections relating to the detention of military prisoners or convicts in civil prisons in a Dominion; the amendments to ss. 60, 64 and 68 and the new section 68a make it clear that a military force visiting a Dominion can only make use of the local civil prisons if authorised to do so by the law of the Dominion.(iii) New definitions of &quot; Dominion &quot; and &quot; colony &quot; are necessary (s. 190 (23)) and in some places the Dominions must be distinguished from other parts of the Empire; cf. s. 189. Similarly the existing section (187a) relating to mandated territories requires subdivision between United Kingdom mandated territories and Dominion mandated territories.
(iv) The amendments to ss. 175, 176, and 190 (4) give effect to arrangements with the Dominions (see note to clause 8) for the mutual attachment of officers and soldiers.(v) The new section 187c preserves the position of the three Dominions who have not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster, and who for the present remain subject to the Army Act as heretofore.Certain amendments in Parts I and III of this Schedule do not apply to the Air Force Act because either (a) the section, subsection or words amended have no counterpart (or exact counterpart) in the Air Force Act, or (6) the amendment in question can be made more briefly in Schedule III.Part II.The amendments to ss. 91 and 174 are designed to bring those sections into more exact accord with the law and administrative arrangements in force in Northern Ireland. As regards s. 91, mental hospital districts in Northern Ireland are not necessarily co-terminous with poor law areas (though as a rule they are co-terminous) and the amendments make provision for the exceptional case and also qualify a provision as to maintenance which is not at present applicable to Irish conditions. As regards s. 174, licensing justices do not technically (as the section suggests) &quot; grant, transfer and renew licences &quot; ; they grant &quot; certificates&quot; which authorise the holders to obtain &quot; the grant, transfer or renewal of licences.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;The other amendments in this Part are consequential upon the passing of the Government of Ireland Act; in most cases (e.g., ss. 108a, 115, 185) they have been dealt with temporarily by &quot; Adaptation&quot; Orders in Council, and it is now proposed to make amendments in the Act itself.Part III.Subject to anything to the contrary in these notes, the amendments in this Part are of a purely drafting character and make no alteration in the law.The Army Act was a compilation from two separate sources (the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War) and since 1881 it has been amended almost annually; in
(iv) The amendments to ss. 175, 176, and 190 (4) give effect to arrangements with the Dominions (see note to clause 8) for the mutual attachment of officers and soldiers.(v) The new section 187c preserves the position of the three Dominions who have not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster, and who for the present remain subject to the Army Act as heretofore.Certain amendments in Parts I and III of this Schedule do not apply to the Air Force Act because either (a) the section, subsection or words amended have no counterpart (or exact counterpart) in the Air Force Act, or (6) the amendment in question can be made more briefly in Schedule III.Part II.The amendments to ss. 91 and 174 are designed to bring those sections into more exact accord with the law and administrative arrangements in force in Northern Ireland. As regards s. 91, mental hospital districts in Northern Ireland are not necessarily co-terminous with poor law areas (though as a rule they are co-terminous) and the amendments make provision for the exceptional case and also qualify a provision as to maintenance which is not at present applicable to Irish conditions. As regards s. 174, licensing justices do not technically (as the section suggests) &quot; grant, transfer and renew licences&quot; ; they grant &quot;certificates,&quot; which authorise the holders to obtain &quot; the grant, transfer or renewal of licences.&quot;The other amendments in this Part are consequential upon the passing of the Government of Ireland Act; in most cases (e.g., ss. 108a, 115, 185) they have been dealt with temporarily by &quot;Adaptation&quot; Orders in Council, and it is now proposed to make amendments in the Act itself.Part III.Subject to anything to the contrary in these notes, the amendments in this Part are of a purely drafting character and make no alteration in the law.The Army Act was a compilation from two separate sources (the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War) and since 1881 it has been amended almost annually; in
consequence, in a number of places there are minor inconsistencies of language and also provisions have become obsolete by reason of the repeal of other Acts referred to in them, or by reason of provision having been made on the subject by some general enactment. Now that fifty years have elapsed since the passing of the Act it seems desirable to make some purely drafting amendments to remove some of these inconsistencies and anachronisms.(i) S. 17. Upon the existing words &quot;money or goods&quot; questions have arisen as to whether, e.g., a postal order, or a money order, should be treated as money or as goods. To avoid any such questions in the future, the more general term &quot;property&quot; is being substituted. This alteration accounts for consequential amendments in ss. 18, 24, 56.(ii) When the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes came into existence, a reference to them was inserted in some of the sections dealing with &quot; theft of &quot; or &quot; injury to &quot; the property of regimental institutions. The refer-ence was not, however, inserted in all the material sections, and this omission is now being rectified see ss. 18, 24, 137. This constitutes a very minor alteration in the law. So too do the amendments to ss. 17, 18, 24 and 137, which extend the terms regimental mess, regimental institution or regimental property to cover a garrison mess, garrison institution or garrison property.(iii) S. 44 of the Army Act contains a list of punish-ments originally arranged carefully in descending order of gravity. At some period in the past this arrange-ment was upset by the insertion of two sub-paragraphs arranged in the reverse order. This oversight in drafting is now being corrected by the amendment to s. 44, and this necessitates the consequential corrections in ss. 182, 183.(iv) Geographical terms. The Army Act at present uses the term &quot;beyond the seas&quot; in many places as meaning outside the United Kingdom. The Irish Free State, as a Dominion, should be in the &quot;overseas&quot; category; it seems undesirable to effect this by defining the Free State as being &quot; beyond the seas &quot; (for Northern Ireland must remain &quot; on this side &quot;). The simpler plan appears to be to drop the phrase &quot; beyond the seas &quot; and to replace it by &quot; outside the United Kingdom &quot; (see last
amendment in this Part). For the sake of uniformity, other expressions such as &quot;abroad,&quot; &quot; home,&quot; &quot;realm,&quot; are being restated in terms of &quot; the United Kingdom &quot;; see ss. 73, 74, 83, 102.(v) Definitions. The Army Act was passed before the Interpretation Act, 1889, and various definitions in s. 190 have never been made to accord with that Act (and in the case of Scotland, with subsequent enact-ments) see e.g., amendments to s. 190 (34) (35).(vi) &quot; Regular Forces.&apos;&apos;1 The Act, as it stands, uses sometimes the phrase &quot; His Majesty&apos;s regular forces&quot; and sometimes the phrase &quot; the regular forces&quot; (each occurs about thirty times) and expressly defines both phrases as meaning exactly the same thing. It seems desirable to adopt throughout one phrase to the exclusion of the other.(vii) The amendments to s. 156, 167, are instances of provisions which have become obsolete by reason of repeals or amendments in the general law: and the other amendments are thought to be self-explanatory.THIRD  SCHEDULE.These amendments, with the exception of those to ss. 181, 190 (which merely correct errors in terminology) correspond with certain amendments made in the Army Act by Schedule II. They are included in a separate Schedule solely for drafting reasons; in consequence of the difference in the wording of the two Acts, to make them in the ordinary way by application of the Army Act amendments &quot;with modifications&quot; would have entailed somewhat long and complicated &quot; adaptation &quot; provisions.40B
