STATE OF TRADE - MARCH 1952. (Summary of Reports made to the B.T.A.C. in connection with their Meeting on April 14th, 1952).There was a substantial improvement in employment during March, the numbers unemployed falling by 134,000, of whom 70,000 had been wholly unemployed.     The improvement was fairly general over the whole country and affected a wide range of industries, including coal mining, textiles, general engineering and building.     The decrease in the number of men unemployed was 77,000.     The comparison generally is affected only to a very small extent by administrative changes.For the first time this year unemployment declined in the coal mining industry;    the figures for March being 13,000 less than in February, 36,000 less than in September last year and 12,000 less than a year ago.     The industry remains however very depressed.     Exports continue to decline and the home market shows no real improvement;    the small decline in unemployment being no doubt mainly due to the colder weather in March.     Only a recovery in industry and particularly in the heavy industries can restore confidence in the mining industry. Of such a recovery however there are few signs at present.Railway traffic receipts for the 5 weeks ended April 3rd shows a fall of 7.3?&apos; which is very much the same as the fall for the 13 weeks of this year, 7.6$.     The 5 weekly period, however, included Easter this year, and, though the comparison is with a period which did not contain Easter, there was a fall in Passenger traffic of 4.4?o.  .  In tonnage during March coal again showed the least falling off, 4.6$ compared with 10.1% and 12.3J5 for light and heavy merchandise respectively.
No improvement is reported in the general position of the Iron and Steel industry.      Imports in March, following heavy imports in previous months, v/ere low in spite of a further reduction in Continental prices, which, for almost all steel products, are now actually below the prices prevailing before the 10^ Duty was imposed.     The tonnage exported in March v/as higher than in February and exceeded imports for the first time since September 1930; nevertheless Export markets generally are reported to be in a dormant condition with the exception of Canada.The depression in Shipbuilding shows no signs of lifting, and the statistics of the trade for the first quarter of the year show that the amount of tonnage under construction in March was lower than at any time for the last 46 years, while the amount of tonnage commenced during the quarter v/as the lowest on record except for one quarter of 1931.     Moreover, the figures of tonnage under construction (694,000 tons gross) include 165,000 tons on which work has been stopped,  (of which 73,000 tons for the new Cunarder) .     Only three new orders v/ere placed during March, for special craft from overseas;    there were no orders for ordinary passenger and cargo tonnage; fortunately there is a considerable volume of repair work, largely seasonal.     Statistically the shipping position appears a little easier,  as freights rose 5 points during the month, but it is reported that this has not been apparent in chartering, and that the tone is if anything worse,  except in homeward chartering from the Argentine,  for v/hich, however, the rates are very low.The report from the motor-car industry is again comparatively good.     The demand for small cars has increased,-and exports are improving steadily, especially in Empire markets.     It is again stated, however,  that depreciation in the dollar would seriously affect this position just when the
t3 j. british manufacturer is really beginning to get frimly established in Overseas markets.     On the other hand, theeffects of the general depression are seen on the home market in a reduced demand for higher-priced cars.     Employmentimproved, but is still below previous years.The machine tool industry reports that the position is,if anything, v/orse.     Home orders are scarce owing to the general depression in industry, and restrictions abroad have resulted inan almost complete cessation in foreign buying except fromRussia, with which country there is a growing trade:   whereas inJanuary last year British exports to Russia were  52,000 inDecember they had risen to  296,000 and for the first two monthsof this year deliveries to Russia totalled  433,862 which is rather more than 2 of the total figures for the year 1931 and3constituted 81% of the British output in January and 85?* in February.      The continuance of this trade with Russia is however represented to be dependent upon the grant of export credits.The improvement in the cotton industry was maintained, and unemployment again declined,  the percentage of unemployed in March being the lowest figure since January,  1930.     There is some slackening off now, however, due partly to seasonal factors in the home market, and partly to fluctuations in the exchange, which have led to uncertainty as to the future of raw cotton prices.     The outstanding feature in export markets is the improvement in exports to the Far East as a result of the boycott of Japanese  oods:   whereas in September Japanese exports to China and Hong Kong were 33 million square yards,  in January they were only 11.6 million sqiare ydds, while United Kingdom exports increased from 4.4 million in September to 26 million in January, and 28 million in February.     From the same cause Lancashire did more trade with Java in March than in the whole of last year.     Improvement is also reported in trade with India in both yarns and piece goods.     On the other hand conditions on the Continent, coupled with the general depression, have made
trading so difficult that the fine spinning section of the industry has decided on six weeks&apos; voluntary restriction of out put.The improvement in the woollen and worsted industry v/as also well maintained.     Employment is substantially better than a year ago, and the percentage unemployed in March was the lowest since December, 1929.     The improvement appears to be largely at the expense of Continental manufacturers, and it is stated that the output of French conditioning houses in March was not more than half of what it was last year.      Some slackening off at present is reported, due,  it is suggested,  to uncertainty as to the probable rate of duty which will replace the 50-1 Abnormal Import duty.     The effect of the 50fv duty is strikingly shown in the imports, which for the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 1951 were, for yarns 90,000 lbs. compared with 5 million lbs., for woollen tissues,  1.3 million square yards compared with 8.4 million square yards,  and for worsted tissues 25,000 square yards compared with 1.7 million square yards,.The report from the silK: industry states that there has been a general slowing down due partly to a tendency to   await the Budget statement and partly to the steady fall in the price of rav/ silk which is now believed, however, to have touched bottom.As regards other industries there was some improvement in employment in the building industry during March which v/as however probably largely seasonal in the decorating section, and unemployment in this and allied industries still remains&apos; very high.     The report from the chemical industry is very encouraging especially in the heavy chemical, fertiliser and dyes tuffs sections, and the rubber industry, although oomplainir^ of competition in footwear from Japan and of the handicap to trade of restrictions in Central Europe, reports that in motor
tyres the ground lost in earlier months had now been regained and that in this section we are obtaining a better proportion of the export trade than formerly.     In the boot and shoe industry employment declined.There were considerable fluctuations in the price of wheat during the month due to the rise in sterling, and prices generally fell from 2/- to 3/- per quarter.     There were as usual heavy shipments from the Argentine and also from Australia, nearly half of whose new crop is going to the Orient.     The new crop in the United States is reported to be good and the President of the Farm Board is in Europe to negotiate for the disposal of its surplus.     Up to the present this year shipments of grain from Russia have been extremely low compared with last year, and the indications are that Russia is not likely to be a serious competitor again until the new crop is ready in August, but the position is obscure.The Co-operative Wholesale Society again reports an increase in sales.     Comparing the figures for departmental stores with those of other countries for February, this country shows a drop of only 2.5?; compared with 16^ in both Germany and the United States.The chief features of the money market during the month v/ere the fall in the bank rate from 5% to 3-gfo and the rise in sterling.     The general feeling on the market was expressed as being one of &quot;cautious optimism&quot;.      It is expected that the bank rate will fall further to Z% in the near future and that there will now be a longish period of cheap money followed by an announcement, probably this year, of an all-over War Lean-Conversion scheme.The figures of Indian trade for last year show that the United Kingdom share of Indian import trade decreased from 40^ to 34*5 while that   from the United States increased by
2.4^, from Germany   &quot;by 1.3$, and from Japan by Ifi.     On the other hand the United Kingdom share of India&apos;s exports increased from 22$ to 27%.     Trade figures for the different centres indicate that the effect of the boycott on the import of British goods has been much greater in Bombay and Bengal than anywhere else, but these are, of course, the most important centres.The chief items of interest in the report from Australia are the statement that up to the end of March approximately  2,000,000 had been paid out in bounty to wheat growers under the wheat Bounty Act and that for the first quarter of this year bank clearings in Melbourne were higher than those in Sydney for the first time for a considerable period;    compared with last year bank clearings in Sydney dropped by  112,000,000 and in Melbourne by only  20,000,000.Canada reports a very confident tone in financial and business circles.     In February Canada had a favourable trade balance for the ninth consecutive month;    exports increased during the month in textiles,  iron and steel and chemicals.In the United States of America the preliminary measures towards the alleviation of a depressing situation are being taken.There is no slacxening in the policy of restriction of imports in the South American countries, in their efforts to obtain a favourable balance of trade.     For example, the imports into the Argentine for the first two months of the year show a reduction of 43.5fi.     In Brazil the new coffee crop is estimated at 16,000,000 to 17,000,000 bags and at&quot;the end of 1931 the surplus was 34,500*000 bags of which the National Coffee Council will destroy or take off the market
87,000,000 bags.     Up to the 5th March last,  3,600,000 hags had been destroyed out of 10,380,000 acquired by the National Coffee Council.
