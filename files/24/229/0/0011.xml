Copy No.COMMITTEE OE IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 255th Meeting, held on March 22, 1932.* * * * * *(2.) INDIAN1SATION IN THE INDIAN ARMY.THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a note by Sir Samuel Hoare, Chairman of the Defence of India Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 180-D), giving a resume of the position that has now been reached regarding Indianisation in the Indian Army.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that this paper was circulated mainly for information. The intention was, however, that the Cabinet should record its opinion as to the measure of responsibility that it is prepared to undertake in regard to the supply of any additional reinforcements that might be required as a consequence of the increase of Indianisation in the Indian Army. The following extract from paragraph 2 of a letter from the India Office to the Government of India, Army Department, dated the 20th August, 1931, which was attached as an Appendix to C.I.D. Paper No. 180-D, appeared to afford the necessary answer :  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibilities to India are, and will remain, such that they cannot conceive that they or their successors could spare any effort, in the event of grave emergency, to secure her safety.-&apos;He proposed that this formula should be submitted to the Cabinet for confirmation.LORD HAILSHAM concurred, but stated that the financial consequences involved would have to be carefully considered at a later date.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) To approve of the note by the Chairman of the Defence of IndiaSub-Committee (OLD. Paper No. 180-D).(b) To recommend that this ]3a.per should be considered by the Cabinet, whowould be asked to confirm that His Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibilities in India are, and will remain, such that they cannot conceive that they or their successors could spare any effort, in the event of grave emergency, to secure her safety.m. .y- j*. 4 . 4*. j;.-TV&quot; -A&quot; -yv &quot;Tv- -W -3v2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 22, 1932.[6763-3]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   December 1931. ;SECRET.1SO-D. Copy No...O. V).....(Also Paper No. D.Z.-41.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.INDIANISATION  OF  THE  INDIAN  ARMY.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 179-D.)NOTE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DRFENCE OF INDIA SUB-COMMITTEE.In OLD. Paper No. 179.D, dated 17th November 1931, the Committee of Imperial. Defence are requested on the Prime Ministers instructions to take note of the decisions reached by the late Government on the Government of India&apos;s proposals regarding Indianisation in the Indian Army. It may be convenient to record briefly how matters stand in this respect.(a) The Cabinet approved in principle that the field of Indianisation should be extended to embrace the components of a complete Indianised War Division. It should be borne in mind that full publicity has already been given to the scheme that is covered by this decision. It is commonly accepted in India and elsewhere that the scheme is now firmly established, and official action has already been taken towards bringing it into full effect. I mention this to indicate the extreme difficulty of modifying the scheme itself in any important respect even if such a course were thought desirable on the merits. In particular, the scheme contains three features which must, I think, be regarded as covered by the approval already given : (1) The increase in the number of Indian Army units to be earmarked for Indianisation; (2) the principle that Indians should henceforth be admitted to such technical units as Field Artillery Batteries aud Armoured Car Companies; and (3) that following on the above, the annual intake into the new Indian Military College (of which more is said below) should be fixed at GO.(h) The Cabinet required that consultation   should  take  place  between  the Secretaries of State for War and India on the four questions of:  (.1) The arming of units.(2) The possible difficulties of mixed personnel in units.(3) The effect on War Office commitments and requirements of any temporaryloss of efficiency due to the change. (4) The establishment of an Indian Sandhurst.(1) In so far as this question is held to involve the principle of raising Field Artillery units. Armoured Car Companies, &amp;c. to be officered and manned by Indians, it must, 1 think, be regarded as covered by the general approval given to the Government of India&apos;s scheme, of which the provision of such units is an integral feature. In so far as the question relates to the method of raising these units, it is being pursued departmentally in consultation with the War Office and the Government of India.(2) IE this question relates to the mixing of British with Indian ranks in the new units to be raised, as foreshadowed in para. 6 of the Government of India&apos;s air mail letter of April 1931, it is as stated under discussion. It may, however, relate to the possible effects of the new scheme on the recruitment of British officers for the Indian Army. Although the scheme itself was made public in outline last spring, there have so far been no appreciable reactions on British recruitment. It will be seen from para. 3 of the letter sent on my predecessors instructions to the Government of India on the 20th August 1931 (copy of which is appended to this Note) that the importance of this matter has already been impressed on the Government of India.(3) The practical requirement:under this head is that the Cabinet should record its opinion as to the measure of responsibility that it is prepared to undertake in regard to the supply of any additional reinforcements that might be required as a 526       SO   12.31
consequence of the increase of Indianisation in the Indian Army. The conclusions-provisionally reached by the War Office and the India Office after consultation on this subject are set out in para. 2 of the letter appended to this Note. It now remains for&apos; the Cabinet (which alone can speak with full authority on such a matter) to confirm those conclusions, and I recommend that it should do so.(4) The principle of establishing a Military Training College in India was accepted by the late Government in the course of the proceedings of the first Indian Round Table Conference, and has been announced and accepted as a settled fact. A Committee consisting partly of Indian non-officials was set up in India last May to-work out the details for the establishment of such a. College,, and its report was published in September. The Government of India have submitted the report officially with their recommendations in a despatch dated 23rd November, which is now under my consideration.(c) The communications which have been addressed to the Government of India are reproduced in the Appendix to this Note to which reference has already been made above.S. H.India. Office,22nd December 1931.APPENDIX.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Foreign Department,dated 1st August 1931.Army Department air mail letter, dated 6th April, 2270.   I am now authorised to-convey to you  His Majest3T&apos;s Governments general approval  of your proposals regarding Indianisation in the officer ranks of the Army, including extension of field of Indianisation and initial intake into new College.    I am communicating-more fully by mail.Letter from India Office to Government of India, Army Department, dated20th August 1931.Indianisation in the Officer Ranks of the Army.In continuation of the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram on the above subject, I am directed to communicate the following observations in connection with the Government of India&apos;s proposals.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken special note of what is said in para. 14 of the Government of India&apos;s air mail letter of the 6th April 1931. It will no doubt be appreciated that at the present time the strength and preparedness of the British Expeditionary Force is no more than sufficient to discharge the obligations for which the Army Council is responsible as matters now stand. If, therefore, the present proposals entail any increased and special preparations for the reinforcement of India, this demand could only be met by an increase in the provision now made within Army Estimates. The financial and other consequences of such a result might have to be very carefully considered, but His Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire at the present juncture- to raise this consideration as an obstacle to acceptance of the Government of India&apos;s main proposals. His Majestys Governments responsibilities to India are, and will remain, such that they cannot conceive that they or their successors could spare any effort in the event of grave emergency to secure her safety.3. It is noted that the Government of India&apos;s proposal, though conceived on a far wider and more progressive scale than the existing system of Indianisation, follows the principle recognised by successive.authorities (with the exception of the Indian Sandhurst Committee of 1927, from whose recommendations in this particular the Government of India of that time dissented), that when Army units are selected for Indianisation recruitment for the officer ranks in those units is thereupon closed to-British officers, in order that the ruiits may be trained in course of time to function under the sole control of Indian officers and the nucleus of a truly national Army may thus be formed.   Events may make it necessary to consider whether, in any further-
pronouncement that may be made with reference to the scheme, this fact should be stressed, both for the sake of emphasising the progressive nature of the Governments policy and of removing any possible misapprehensions on the part of the British candidates who will still be required in considerable numbers for the officer ranks of the remaining components of the Indian Army.4. A. connected question is that of obtaining British volunteer personnel for the technical units to be earmarked for Indianisation. It will presumably be made clear beyond doubt that the recruitment of such personnel will be on a wholly voluntary basis. The terms to be offered in order to attract candidates of the most suitable type may require careful consideration.5. It has not yet been found possible to arrive at any final decision with regard to the precise method to be followed in the formation of the new technical units-Correspondence on this matter is proceeding with the War Office on the basis of the telegrams exchanged on the 2nd and 12th May 1931, and the Secretary of State hopes that it will shortly be possible to reach agreed conclusions.6. In this connection, it has no doubt been recognised that the deliberate-acceptance of the policy of creating such units as Field Artillery Batteries within the Indian Army may lead to a renewal of the demand on the part of certain Indian States for permission to raise corresponding batteries with similar equipment within the Indian State Forces. The principal ground upon which such a claim was rejected on the last occasion was that it would be followed by a claim for the equipment of the Indian Army with similar Artillery. In present circumstances the Government of India are presumably prepared to deal with any such claims on their merits if they should again be preferred.7. It is clearly desirable that the large increase in the number of regular Indian officers in the Army should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of Indian officers available in the reserves. b&quot;or this purpose presumably the Government of India would ordinarily depend on the Indian members of the Army in India Reserve of Officers. It must be admitted that the results so far achieved in building up a reserve of Indian officers are disappointing. It may be, however,, that the large increase which is now to take place in Indianisation, coupled with the establishment of a Military College in India, may serve to stimulate recruitment to the desired extent. But here again, as in the case mentioned in para. 4, it may be found that the terms offered for service in the reserve will call for further consideration.8 The suggestion in para. 11 of the Government of India&apos;s air mail letter, that the whole question of the future pay of Indian commissioned officer ranks should be considered in detail by the Indian Military College Committee, has already been disposed of separately in the correspondence ending with the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram dated 27th June, No. 1953. In regard to the more general question of the expense entailed by the present proposals which is mentioned in the same paragraph, the Secretary of State would suggest for consideration that it may not prove necessary to adopt in the new officer establishments in the Indiauising units the actual numbers laid down for the corresponding British Army units. There may be good reason for reproducing an establishment of this kind in the Indian Army, particularly during the earlier stages of the new scheme and for so long as the number of officers available from the reserves is relatively small. Nevertheless the possibility of a reduction might, in the Secretary of State&apos;s opinion, be usefully borne in mind.
