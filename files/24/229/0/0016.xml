145[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. n-*&quot;   3i 9G,P. 116(^S5) COPY NO.CABINET. STATE OF TRADE      FEBRUARY. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the   Board of Trade Advisory Council on the state of trade in February, 1932.W.R.Board of Trade, 24th March, 1932.
11 r*STATS Off TRADE - H5BRU.ARY ,  1952 - BROM REPORTS TO THJi BOARD 0? TRADJS ADVISORY COUNCIL,During February there were striking developments in the financial situation;    an entire reversal of foreign opinion regarding the future of sterling resulting in an influx of foreign funds, not only at call and in bills but by investment in gilt edged securities and industrials, thus lessening the danger of sudden withdrawal.     The change in the response to new issues has been equally striking;    four of these amounting to  5*000,000 in all were oversubscribed from 10 to 25 times; the ,27,000,000 Central iilectricity Board issue which was a failure in January, 34-g$ being left with the underwriters, has now gone to a premium of 4-g$.The appreciation of the  , ooming as it has before the enhanoed competitive power of British sterling prices has had time to reap the full advantage of the departure from the Gold Standard, has created serious apprehension in the minds of traders generally and particularly in the Cotton, Silk and Artificial Silk and kotor industries.      In general the commercial community are of opinion that the recovery of our export trade and the establishment of better conditions throughout the country depends on the ,-3 being at a level which is justified by the trade facts and not by speculation.koreover, overseas trade with a great many foreign countries is being seriously hampered by restrictions imposed on exohange transactions.     Conditions in thisrespect are particularly bad in Austria, Hungary and Italy.     The position in the Argentine and Poland seems to have improved but that in Brazil remains somewhat obscure.     A remedy has been sought in many cases in pooling or clearing arrangements but none of these have been found to work satisfactorily.
mInevitably trade is affected in general by recent fiscal changes and by apprehensions or hope of coming changes of the kind.      Indications for the future are thus confused but there are hopeful signs for the future in the shape of the undoubted success of the British Industries Fair and a general feeling of confidence among retail buyers.There was a slight improvement in emplo,, ment as a whole during February,  the number of registered unemployed at February 22nd, viz.  2,701,173,  showing a fall of 27,238 since January 25, or about 1%.      Of this some 17,000 may be attributed to the results of legislative changes.     Of the gross reduction 18,000 was among women.     The numbers unemployed in the Horth Western Division fell by 16,000 (due mainly to an improvement in cotton)t     The Horth eastern was the only Division in which there was a net increase.     Employment declined in coal mining and in the jute industry.      The total number of insured persons estimated to be in employment on February 22nd was 9,403,000 as compared with 9,326:000 a year before.In the coal mining industry unemployment again increased. The output of coal during recent weeks has been below the average for the previous year and very much below the average of earlier years.      Increasing difficulties are being experienced in the shape of severe restrictions by continental countries, chiefly Germany, France and Belgium.     There is some hope of improvement in the French   trade owing to the removal of the surtax on coal but the Gorman restrictions are very severe and will,  if the representations that are being made are not successful, bring the monthly average of British coal allowed in down from 400,000 tons as at October 1st last, to about 100,000 tons only as from April 1st.     i-polish competition in Scandinavia is still intense.      The homo trade has been depressed hy
unseasonable weather, and the very low requirements of the railways and of the iron and steel trade.Railway traffic receipts for the first eight weeks of the year show in fact a fall of 7.6&apos;,o - very much the same over the three principal classes, passenger, coal and merchandise.     Coal in fact showed the least falling off, 7.20$, and for the whole of 1931 the decrease in tonnage of coal carried was only 10;$ as compared with nearly 405$ for iron ore and over 20;.$ for other iron and steel trade traffics.In the iron and steel trade oonditions remain on the whole unsatisfactory, though production in February showed a considerable increase over the January figure and was not far short of February, 1931;    there is also rather more hope based on anticipation of increased tariffs.     Meanwhile Continental prices which include the 10$ duty are extremely low - joists about  4 delivered at factories near English ports as compared with the British price of  7.10.     The indications are that many Continental steel makers are sustaining heavy losses; efforts to renew international price agreements (Sales Syndicates) have entirely failed and the Cartel (for market allocations) is consequently in a state of suspense.Shipbuilding remains most depressed;    an order for a small tug was the only one recorded as placed in the United Kingdom during February.     As stated in answer to a recent Parliamentary Question, it may be added, work was proceeding at the end of December at only 14$ of the ship-building yards not definitely closed down.
Laid up shipping remains about the sane - nearly 1?,000,000 tons gross throughout the world of which some 3,000,000 Is American and about the same figure In British home-ports.The Index of shipping freights has increased by 5 per cent, but is still only 82% of the pre-war level.   Exchange restrictions are felt to be holding back outward shipments. Homeward the Argentine has been most active, especially in grain.    Owing no doubt to the general restriction of trade, tonnage has become very scaroe in the East and there and in Australia sudden demands have brought about advances in rates.Conditions in the motor car industry remain muoh as in January.    Hew registrations continue to deoline.   Figures are only available for January;    they show that hackneys fell by 47% as compared with January, 1931.    Exports are up in numbers though down in value, the drop being very serious in commercial vehicles for which the February value is but a quarter of that for February, 1931.    The demand for light trucks is fairly steady but that for heavy vehicles is affected by railway propaganda and taxation is again stated to have a depressing effect on high powered vehicles.The rubber industry report a good demand for motor tyres. The demand for pedal cycle tyres continues Extremely good&apos;.In the cotton industry there was an increase in inquiries and a general tendency for more weaving machinery to come into operation.    Prices however, especially in yarns, remain unsatisfactory.An analysis of the cotton piece goods export trade for January last compared with 191? figures shows that dyed goods have fared best and greys worst;    the all round proportion of machinery activity allowing for reduced hours is about 38$ only (i.e. of the 1913 level).     On the other hand our export
of yarn is about the same as in 1913 and in January was actually lOfa more mainly owing to recent increased trade with China at japan b expense;    in January and February of this year our exports of yarn to China (including Hong Kong) were over 5,000,000 lbs., ten times as much as in the same months of 1913.      In this market also our exports of piece goods were about 54,0009000 square yards in January and February (as compared with about 30,000,000 in January and February,  1931, and 28,500,000 in January and February, 1930)  - substantial increases but due to temporary conditions.It was shown that in India Japanese prices have fallen since march 1931, more than British, and it is only in ooloured goods that the relative prioe position of England has improved since September last.Complaint is made of considerable advances In the price of dyestuffs and chemicals attributed to depreciation of sterling and the new duties.The Abnormal Import Duties imposed on woollens have reduced the imports from nearly  2.,000,000 in January and February of last year to  354,000 in the same months of this year, and though no great progress in augmenting productive capacity will be made until the permanent duties are fixed, for the present employment is maintained, more than 1,200 unemployed having been taken on again in the Bradford area.    Exports of tops and yarns are good;    but piece goods show a falling off.   Prices of raw 770ol have fallen by 5 to 10 per cent.As regards other industries the chemical trade for February vra3 better on the whole.     The rubber trade  (except for tyres as already referred to) was from normal to dull;    complaint is again made of cheap imports.    The improvement in the boot and shoe trade arising from the departure from the Gold Standard is exhausting itself and the volume of forward business is on the whole not satisfactory.
The price of v/heat advanced during the month at Chicago by 4g-a. per quarter only, but by 2/6d. in the Argentine, and l/6d. at Liverpool and Winnipeg.   The United State8 rdreat, in spite of the relatively small advance,  is not yet on an export parity.   Visible supplies of Canadian wheat fell by 9 million bushels between January 8th and February 12th, although farmers in the West put this quantity on the market during that time.   Large supplies are available and moving in Australia and especially the Argentine, whence heavy shipments are being made to this country (3,100,000 cwts. imported in February P 10$ more than from Canada).     Russian exports of wheat are declining, but between January 25th and February 26th,   ;880,000 cwts. of wheat were exported to this country and nearly twice as much of other grain.     To summarise the wheat position -demand is increasing (as shown, e.g., by the rise in the admitted import quotas for France and Italy) and appears to be overtaking the visible supply.Co-operative trading in England and Wales during February showed increases both in value, 5.5$, and in quantities, e..g0,  sugar is up 21$, tea 1307$.       In Scotland values fell mostly owing to the fall in prices, but quantities were also down slightly.       For the retail trade of the departmental stores in February, figures are not yet available but conditions are reported to have improved definitely and there is a general feeling of confidence among buyers.     Retail prices are 15o4$ below those of a year ago, while the corresponding figure for wholesale prices is only 14,1$.
India is still suffering from the disparity between the prices for her staple exports and imports, but there has boen a marked appreciation in thd price of Indian raw cotton which, though a yt-ar ago it was only 76   of tho price for hiddling American, is now up to 9&amp;/o of that price;    the Indian crop has been poor but on the whole the purchasing power of the Indian ootton cultivator is improved.The most significant figures communicated as regards Australian trade were those of the bank clearances at Melbourne and Sydney for the first two months of the year;    while the former fell from 3112,000,000 (in January, February, 1931) to 396,000,000, the figures for Sydney dropped from 3170,000,000 to 394,000,000.An official report from Canada shows that there were no important changes in production and business during January as compared with December, but the index of employment fell by 2 points during the month whereas the normal change is an increase of 1 point.     During 1931 considerable further development of Canada&apos;s water resources took place and the total installation is now 6/5 million H.P., only about 15 i of her estimated available resources.The recent course of Canada&apos;s balance of (visible)trade presents some Interesting features.     Favourable since1922, it became adverse to the extent of $103 million in 1930 when 00the Smawt Hawley Tariff was adopted in the United States of america The position was again reversed in June, 1931, and for the ten months ending January, 1932, has been nearly $20 million in Canada&apos;s favour.Recent financial measures in the United States of America are generally regarded as at any rate steps in the right direction.
