this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1932. SECRET. Copy No.    9COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 255th Meeting, held on March 22, 1932.******(5). THE SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST.   REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.(OLD. Paper No. 1084-B.*)The Committee of Imperial Defence had before thern a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1084-B*) dealing with the situation in the Far East, and containing recommendations for the strengthening of the defences at Singapore, Hong Kong and Trincomali.THE PRIME MINISTER mentioned that this was the Report promised by the Chiefs of Staff in paragraph 18 of their Annual Review (OLD. Paper No. 1082-B). It was recommended that the Committee of Imperial Defence should give approval in principle to a number of measures for increasing the security of Singapore, Flong Kong and Trincomali in view of the deterioration of the situation in the Far East. The Report naturally did not deal with the question of finance. Here again the matter was one in which the three Service Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were chiefly involved, and the final decision must rest with the Cabinet.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER pointed out that in matters of detail the Report, to some extent, cut across the work of the Coast Defence Committee, which would be in a position to present their Report soon after Easter.Mr. BALDWIN, the Chairman of the Coast Defence Sub-Committee, confirmed this view.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the Coast Defence Report was available the Cabinet should be in possession of enough information to reach a decision. He suggested that if the Committee had no comments on the Report from the point of view of policy, they should receive it and refer it to the Cabinet for consideration as early as possible.Conclusion.Pending the Report of the Coast Defence Sub-Committee, the Committee of Imperial Defence reached no conclusion on the recommendations contained in the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the measures for increasing the security of Singapore, Hong Kong and Trincomali (OLD. 1084-B), but agreed that the Report should at once be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.^2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 22, 1932.[6763-2]* Oirculcited to Cabinet as CP. 104 (32).
