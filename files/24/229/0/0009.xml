(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE STY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .SECRETCP.109(52)COPY NO.   ACABINETINDIAAppreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India,  dated 18th March 1932.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 18th March, 1932, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.In the 2nd paragraph of the last appreciation, thethree main features of the civil disobedience campaignwere stated to be the following:(1) The silent boycott of British goods and institutions.(2 ) Picketing.(3) The observance of particular days.There has been no marked change in the programme during the past month, and 2 circulars issued by the. actingPresident of the All-India Congress Committee, and recentlyintercepted, confirm the vie?/ that these, at present,constitute the main lines of agitation.     Special importance is attached to the first item,  in which are also includedattacks on revenue of the Government by picketing of liquorshops, and by the more indirect method of curtailing useof railways, Post Offices, etc., and by restricted use offoreign articles on which duty is payable.     Particularmerit is attached to the indirect methods, since theyallow those to participate who do not wish openly to courtimprisonment or to defy the law.     The economic boycottprogramme is described as the most powerful and most practical weapon, and the opinion expressed is that if itis wielded effectively it should bring the British Empireto its knees in a comparatively short time.     Another itemwhich is mentioned as being suitable for mass movement isthe defiance of forest laws in Provinces where circumstances are favourable.Particular stress is laid in the circulars on two matters.      Firstly, the necessity of continuousdemonstrations
demonstrations in order to keep civil disobedience before the public, and, secondly, to maintain a continuous stream of prisoners.     The objects of frequent demonstrations are to maintain public excitement at a high pitch, and to provoke clashes with the police.     The circulars are, to some extent, reassuring, since they &quot;betray considerable apprehension regarding the prospects of the movement, and the frank admission is made that &quot;the present situation threatens to demoralise the rank and file and to infect the public with defeatism&quot;.     The circulars also admit that measures taken by the Government have caused considerable dislocation of plans.If it were possible to isolate civil disobedience from other political tendencies, the apprehension manifested in these circulars could certainly be regarded as well-founded.     There are, however, other factors which preclude a too sanguine forecast.     Taking civil disobedience alone there has been a definite improvement during the past month in several directions, and there has been no specific set-back, such as might easily have occurred.     In all the Provinces the situation is well under control,  and in most it is cause of comparatively little anxiety.      There are reasons to believe that movement is now on the down grade in Madras, United Provinces, Bihar and Orissa and Central Provinces.In Bengal, indications are less clear, but activities are of a limited scope and over large parts of the Province are of very slight intensity.     The position in Bombay Presidency appears to be much the same as in Bengal, with the important exception of Bombay City, where there has been a definite deterioration on the economic side.In
In the Pun j ah, movement so far has been slight, but it may gain strength owing to participation of Ahrars and of Sikh extremists.     The situation in North West Frontier Province may be regarded as very satisfactory.   There has been unrest among Mohmands and threats of invasion of British territory. Several lashkars had been formed, and it has been necessary to take aerial action against the offending villages.     In one case direct action has been possible against members of a lashkar.     At the moment, the tribal situation seems to be settling down.       Activities across the frontier have naturally encouraged some recrudescence of Red Shirt agitation in settled districts, but this has been confined to parts of Peshawar District and has not been of serious extent.     Nor has it stopped the general improvement in other parts of the district.     In the four remaining districts of the province, conditions are practically normal.     Increasing interest is being taken in the forthcoming elections, and although there will doubtless be attempts to boycott them and possibly to use them as occasion for disturbance, there would now seem to be a good prospect of the new constitution being introduced without any setback of a serious character.     Next month is likely to be a decisive period so far as this province is concerned.The above survey, province by province, requires to be qualified by reference to particular factors and tendencies.     Although a decline in the number of convictions has already begun in some provinces, the figures for the month of February are likely to be large and the number of persons still courting imprisonment is considerable.     Until a marked decline in convictions is apparent, no certain claim can be made that the tide hasf inally
finally and definitely turned in favour of the Government. Again, during the past month there have been more instances of resort to violence or at any rate of departure from non-violent methods.The worst example is the deliberate organisation of attempts in Bengal and Bihar and Orissa to plait Congress flag on Government buildings and,  in particular, on police stations.     On two occasions, the attempts made were very determined, and had not resort been made to firing, a small force of police and other Government servants might have lost their lives.     These attempts were prompted by the then acting-President of Congress and were definitely part of the campaign to excite and maintain popular interest.       During the past few days, the same tendency has been manifest in Delhi, where deliberate defiance of orders resulted in clash between riotous crowds and police.     The latter were heavily stoned on several occasions and, in one case, a constable was stabbed. Muslims took prominent part in these local disturbances, and the entry of police into the precincts of a mosque further excited feelings.       At the moment the situation shows some signs of settling down, but it is unstable ana there may be a recrudescence of the trouble.Over the country as a whole there has been no improvement in the boycott position,   and, in some places, there -has been a deterioration.     This is particularly so in Bombay City, where Congress, partly through intimidation and partly through the appeals they make to sentiment, appear to have excluded British firms from a large part of both future and ready business.     The economic situation there is stated to be worse than during 1930, and, as a result, Bombay is losing a good deal of our trade.The
The Muslim position is definitely more uncertain than a month ago.   There is still no inclination on the part of the great majority of Muslims to take sides with Congress, but at the same time there is little disposition to come out openly on the side of the Government and one party of Muslims has, for all practical purposes, adopted civil disobedience.       The most important instance of this is provided by the Ahrars, whose organisation started a few months ago in connection with Muslim grievances in Kashmir.       They have now announced a programme in which the;/ propose to adopt certain forms of civil disobedience on various grounds, among which are (1 ) position in Kashmir,(2) failure at present of His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognise Muslim claims in the constitutional field, and(3) events in the North West Frontier Province.These three items of their programme are intended to attract the general body of Muslims.     Actually there is reason to belive that the Ahrars are in close association with Congress, and for that reason, there is a tendency on the part of Muslims in general to regard them with suspicion.     If other things were favourable, there would be little danger of many Muslims following the Ahrars. Recent events in Delhi show, however, the danger of subversive movements spreading among those who, in the initial stages, are definitely opposed to them.The origin of the trouble there was due partly to the local Ahrar organisation and partly to the Nationalist Muslims, who are openly in adherence to Congress.       As a result of the action which had to be taken to meet these activities, a number of Muslims have been, at leasttemporarily
temporarily, affected who would otherwise hare remained aloof.   Fro-Congress Muslims are, of course, quick in adopting a programme which will contain some items of general appeal to their co-religionists, and the most important of these is the non-acceptance, up-to-date, of the huslim claims in the constitutional field. The feeling of   insecurity and uncertainty is widespread, and this is reflected, first,  in the reluctance of Muslims to commit themselves too definitely on the side of the Government until they know where they stand; second,  in the pressing for the settlement of their claims while the Government are at issue with Congress; and, third, in irritation at local incidents of little intrinsic importance.On the constitutional side, feeling is manifested by the increasing strength of the movement against further co-operation with the Constitutional Committee until the Communal question is settled. An important meeting of the huslim Conference is to take place at Lahore on the 20th, where this question v/ill be discussed.The feeling of impatience is not confined to the Muslims. As was observed in the last appreciation, the sooner tangible results can be presented in constitutional fields, the easier will be the task of the Government in dealing with subversive movements. The public see the results of the preventative side of the Government&apos;s policy, while the fruits of reforms are still outside their grasp.   They are apt to draw hasty and wrong conclusions and to underestimate the obstacles in the way of constitutional progress, and to assume that the delay is deliberate.   The fact that the many difficulties are due to failure of theIndian
Indian parties and communities to agree among themselves does not really help.   Feelings of exasperation tend to grow, and with them the inclination to criticise the Government for the measures which would be accepted as inevitable by a large section of the public if they felt certain that they were the prelude to early constitutional advance.
