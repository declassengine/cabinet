(2)  In the case of fTransfer Instructional Centres&apos; where men from the depressed areas are re-conditioned by work such as levelling ground, preparatory to their being put on road and other relief works, the principle now in force of admitting men to these Centres only in so far as there are likely to be
jobs for then after training, to be relaxed and the men to he admitted for three months training or re-conditioning irrespective of any expectation of being placed in employment at the end of that time.The men to be paid (as at present) not -wages, but benefit or transitional payment plus a small supplementary allowance and to he recruited in the first instance on a voluntary basis.In order to  enable the experiment to be tried out on a scale sufficiently large and under conditions sufficiently varied to enable reliable conclusions to be drawn, it was suggest-ed in the Memorandum that it should proueed on tne basis of about 3^000 training places in all dealing with about 10,000 tc 11,000 men in a full year (as against 825 training places dealing with 2,500 men a year as at present authorised), (3)    Physical Instruction Courses.    The Minister of Labour also proposed a second experiment in the shape of the establishment of courses of physical instruction, particularly for young men between say 18 and 30 years of age.    The immediate pro-posal being to organise courses in two or three carefully selected exchange areas at an inclusive cost not exceeding  3,000 for an experiment covering 2,000 men urn one year. 4a The &apos;Transfer Instructional Centres&apos;  have in thepast rnajnly relied on the schemes of relief worksaided by the St. David1s Committee to provide work for
their trainees,    These schemes are coming to an end and if no action is taken it will he necessary to close down the Centres,,      In our opinion the Government would he subjected to damaging criticism if, after having stopped relief works and reduced unemployment benefit, it failed to carry on the training and re-conditioning arrangements. Moreover, we are satisfied that these arrangements are very valuable in the interests of the men themselves, both by fitting them for regular work and helping them to maintain their morale and self respect.      In the course of our consideration of the proposals it has been pointed out,however, thetefchey constituted a new experiment which it might be desirable to test for alimited period and on a smaller scale than that contemp--lated in the Memorandum submitted to us0       In these circumstances,  the Minister of Labour has suggested as a compromise that he should be authorised to keep the six existing Centres filled and to re-cpen the five -closed Centres,5&quot; ?/ith regard to the physical instruction courses,it is proposed that these should be on a voluntary basisthereforeand it will not/be necessary to use any compulsory powers,     The courses will be open both to men in receipt of ordinary Unemployment Benefit, as well as to men in receipt of Transitional Benefit,6. We think that the working of both theseexperiments should be carefully supervised and that the
Ministry of Labour should confer with the Ministryof Hea.lth^so as to ensure that the experience Oflocal Authorities conducting similar experimentsshould he available for  the Ministry of Labour.-,70 We recommend the Cabinet -(I)    Tnat the Minister of labour should be auth.orl.sed bo carry oat as an experiment, the proposals regarding &quot;Transfer Instructional Centres1  set out in his Memorandum (E0C.(38)  5), subject, hoy/ever, to the modification of paragraph 5 of that Memorandum so as to secure that the scheme is limited in the first instance to (a) keeping the six existing Centres filled, and (b) re-opening the five closed Centres and keeping these Centres filled.    - Th&apos;  experiment to be tried for a period of six months and to be reviewed towards the close of that periodsNy^E:    The Financial Secretary to the Treasury has asked that the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with regard to (b) above, namely,  the E3r-opening of the five closed.

We are unanimously of opinion that there is no case for the proposed Mid-Scotland Canal, whether on traffic or other grounds, and accordingly that no useful purpose would be served by the expenditure of public money on a preparatory geo-physical survey. 10.    We invite the Cabinet to adopt the Conclusions which we have reached in regard to this matter..heme       11.   We attach (Appendix II) a Report prepared at our request ondonircle the Minister of Transport on the present position withregard to the scheme for a London Outer-Circle railway. 12*    We are unanimously agreed that, in view of the terms of the Minister of Transport&apos;s Report, the proposal is not one which we can recommend the Cabinet to entertain.oposed   13.    We attach (Appendix III) a Memorandum by the Minister of Bridge.Transport on the facilities for road transport across the River Forth,14.     our conclusions with regard to this matter are as follows(1) That the Queensferry and Rosyth proposals are impracticable.(2) That the question of assistance from the Road Fund towards the Kincardine proposal should be determined in the ordinary course by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport;    the scheme appears to us to be desirable in itself, but the Minister, would no doubt before recommending a Grant consider, having

The Report of the Cabinet Committee onoyedent Agricultural Policy (C.p02l(32)) contained a recommendations.to the effect that if it was desired to reverse the decision not to make any Government grant towards&apos; the scheme for providing unemployed allotment holders with o$ii&amp;o, fertilisers, etc., at cheap rates, consideration might be given to the question of assisting the Society of Friends on a   for   basis.The Cabinet left the decision on this recommend-ation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Cabinet 11(32) Conclusions 3(d)).      We understand that as a result cf an appeal made by the Society of Friends it is probable that a sufficiency large sum of money to cover the expenditure on the scheme during the current year will be subscribed by the public, and &amp;aat--ln view of this and other considerations the two Ministers have agreed that the previous decision that no Government grant should be made towards the scheme, should be maintained so far as the current year is concerned.16.

E.0.(32)5.COPY NO,CABINET,EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.PROPOSALS FOR TRAINING ON A NEW BASIS.I informed the Committee at their first meeting (E.C(32) 1st Conclusions paragraph 3) that a fuller memorandum on the Ministry of Labour training and reconditioning schemes was in preparation than that ?;hich had been furnished to the Committee v/hich was presided over by Major Elliot.     In accordance with the promise then given,    I now circulate the memorandum inquestion and I trust that subject to the concurrence of the Treasury, my colleagues will concur in immediate action beingtaken to give effect to the suggestions therein made.      The alternative is a large reduction in the training facilities offered to the unemployed at a time when such facilities are most urgently required.(Intd.)    H. B.10th March,  1932.
UHEMPLOYISENT. PROPOSALS FOg TRAINING- ON A ITKff BASIS. Memorandum by the Hinistry of Labour.1.      The Ministry1 s training arrangements for unemployed men, of which there are two types, have been conducted hitherto on the basis that the man who completes his course satisfactorily should have a reasonable expectation of being placed in employ-ment at the end of it.      In what are known as the &quot;Government Training Centres&quot; men are given a preliminary training for skilled trades, and most of the men are placed sooner or later in ordinary industrial employment.      In the ,;Transfer Instructional Centres&quot; men from the depressed areas are &apos;reconditioned&apos; by such work as levelling ground, land drainage or preparing land for forestry operations,  designed to prepare them for being placed out subsequently on relief schemes of the roadmaking and public works type.     From this type of centre also most of the men trained are found employment, usually temporary,  at the end of their period of training.      To ensure that a substantial proportion of the men trained are later placed In employment the numbers admitted are adjusted from time to time to the numbers it is expected to place.      It has therefore been found necessary largely to reduce during the last year the number admitted to the Government Training Centres - and a further drastic cut is about to be made - while,  in the case of the Transfer Instructional Centres,  the number to be admitted under present arrangements will decline from now onwards as relief schemes are completed, until by next winter the centres will have dwindled almost to nothing.      In short, if no change in the basis of training is made,  the facilities provided by the Ministry for the training of unemployed men will have been severely contracted by next winter.      In view of the probable persistence of a high rate of unemployment for some time, involving a steady increase in the proportion of men unemployed   .
for .long periods,  it seems worth while to maintain end,if possible,  to develop the training facilities provided bythe Ministry rather than to allow then to fall into disuse.A summary of the allowances paid to men in training is given in the Appendix.2.      The &quot;Government Training Centres&quot; must continue on their present basis;    men can only he trained in such numbers ss they cen be placed.      But at the Transfer Instructional Centres a change could be made.     Host of them are on Government property (e.g. estates of the Forestry Commission), where there is a large amount of useful work which is not likely to be carried out for a long time,  if paid labour has to be emplo3red.      It has been proved to be very suitable as a means of &quot;reconditioning1 men suffering from long unemployment.      It is suggested that the principle now in force of admitting cen to the Transfer Instructional Centres only in so far as there are likely to be jobs for them after training should be relaxed,  end that men should be admitted for three months training or &quot;reconditioning&apos; irrespective of any expectation of being placed in employment at the end.      A certain number 7/ould be placed at the end of that time, but, unless trade greatly improves,  the majority would have to return hone.     They would be paid (as at present), not wages, but benefit or transitional payments and a small supplementary allowance.      In addition, to regular land work, of which there is a considerable variety,  the men would receive manual instruction of various kinds,  and there would be organised games.     The experience which has been gained and the technique which has been evolved st the existing Centres, would, it is believed,  ensure that the evils associated with the old-fashioned &quot;relief&quot; works could be avoided.      Independent observers and the local officers of the Ministry,  in places where unemploy-ment has been severe and protracted, lay great stress on the urgent necessity of breaking up the long spells of unemployment by some form of occupation,  if physical and moral deterioration
is to be checked.     The physical and moral improvement of men trained at the existing centres is very striking,  and it is believed that equal results could be obtained on the system now proposed, provided that the men are given clearly to understand what thej are being offered when they are recruited. S.       The men would be recruited in the first instance on a voluntary basis, but to enable discipline to be enforced when they had entered the centre they would be formally required to attend a &quot;course of instruction&quot;,  as is done nov^ with men sent to the existing centres,   so that when they had commenced training they would not be able to break: the rules with impunity or to leave the centre unjustifiably before completing the course without suffering the loss of benefit. 4.        Suitable work and sites for centres where they do not exist, can be found on Forestry Commission land;    on War Office lend at Catterick and Aldershot (playing-fields and parade-grounds) ;    possibly on certain land-drainage schemes in which the Ministry of Agriculture are interested;    and possibly on a number of civil aerodromes in v/hich the Air Ministry are interested.      (The aerodromes would involve negotiations with local authorities.     They are not likely to be carried out at present.with paid labour,  and the land will cost more the longer they are postponed.      The Ministry of Labour have already levelled one aerodrome,  at Blackpool, with men in training et a Transfer Instructional Centre there).5.       The Ministry of Labour estimates for 1932-3 provide for about 825 training places being- occupied in 6 Transfer Instructional Centres, v/hich would enable about 2,500 men to be dealt with in the year..        The experiment ought to be tried on a scale sufficiently large and under conditions sufficiently varied,  to enable reliable conclusions to be drawn..     The Ministry have five centres temporarily closed, which could be reopened quickly, besides the six in working order.      It would be of value also to try one or two centres on V/ar Office, aerodrome and land drainage work.      It is suggested that the
o r: qL J i)experiment should proceed on the basis of about 3,000 training places in all,  dealing with about 10,000 - 11,000 men in s. full year.      This would cost about  180,000 (exclusive of benefit), or  120,000 more then the sum et present proposed in the Ministry of Labour estimates.6.       On this basis the cost of the scheme,  including benefit or transitional payments, would be about  100 a year for each&quot;place&quot; provided, or about  35 a head for each man trained.This figure of  100 may be compared with  260,  the estimatedcost of providing a nan with a year&apos;s work on relief works.There would be naterial assets of some value at the end,  inthe shape of the work dene,, in addition to the physical andnoral improvement which is the main object of the scheme.7.       It nay be objectedthat the work ought to be done for wages.The answer to this objection has been indicated.      The work would not be done at all,  if wages had to be paid.      the residual value 7/ould seldom show a commercial return.      Theobject is to save unemployed men from deterioration.      It isfrankly an experinen-o.     The total amount of the work available is not such as to constitute any appreciable encroachment onthe sphere of public works undertaken on a commercial basis.8.        The second experiment proposed is the establisliment of courses of physical instruction, particularly for young nenbetween,  say,  18 and 30 years of age.      A scheme has been worked out in the Ministry with the assistance of the Directorof Physical Training of the V/ar Office for courses of physicaltrainirlasting   for three hours a week for thirteen weeks.      It isbelieved that courses of this kind would be appreciated bythe men themselves and would be of real value in improving the standard of their physique.      Opportunities for physical training are still rare,  despite the efforts of a fewvoluntary organisations who have interested themselves in thenatter,  and, generally,  this country is far behind Germanyand Ozecho-Slovakia, for example,  in organising physical
training for the unemployed as well as for the employed. It is hoped that these officially provided courses will provide a stimulus to the development of physical training on sound lines.      The kind of physical training intended is not of the old drill sergeant type and does not possess a militarist tias.      It is devised to sharpen.the mind as well as tc quicken and develop the body and would be given only by fully qualified instructors,  of whom a considerable number sre now unemployed.     Physical training is given in most Junior Instruction Centres, and has been very successful tbe.ro.      It is included in the courses provided by the L.G.C. for men on out relief, and its value there is reported on most favourably.Local opinion,  so far as it has been consulted, particularly in the depressed areas,  is strongly in favour of attempting some experiment on these lines, and the. immediate proposal is to organise courses in two or three carefully selected Exchange areas.     The cost,  including the hire of a hall, the provision of equipment and elementary apparatus, for an experiment covering 2,000 men in cne year would probably not exceed  3,000.10th March,  1932.
APPENDIX.At both types of Centres the men receive any unemploy-ment benefit or transitional payments to which they may be entitled^      The amounts would, of course, vary in accordance with the circumstances of the individual.     In addition, supplementary allowances are paid as follows;-Non-residential Centres.(All Government Training Centres except Glaydon).(a)    Single men. - an allowance which with unemployment benefit or transitional payment is sufficient to leave the men with 4e. per week for personal expenses after payment has been made for board and lodging at the approved local rate.(h)    Married men - as for single men, plus 8s. per week.(c)    In addition, men receive a free mid-day meal,except on Sundays,  and working kit, when necessary. Residential Centres.(All Transfer Instructional Centres except Carshalton).(a) Single nen have to pay for beard and lodging from their unemployment benefit or transitional payment an amount sufficient to leave them with 4s. per week for personal expenses.(b) Married men have to pay 3s.3d. per week for board and lodging,  this payment allowing them to send home what they would be able to send home if thej?-were at a non-residential centre.
APPENDIX 2.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI8 BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT).CABINET.6. COPY NO.SCHEME FOR A LONDON OUTER-CIRCLE RAILWAY.Note by the Minister of Transport.1.     The expression &quot;London Outer Circle Railway&quot; is generally understood to mean a railway north of the Thames along the whole or part       a route from some point (say) 8 or 10 miles to the west of the centre of London, passing through the northern suhsurhs and terminating at the Victoria Docks or Tilbury on the east.     Railways of this kind were authorised by Parliament in 1866, I870, 1882 and 1888, but were not proceeded with. Proposals of a similar character were brought before Parliament in 1906, 1911, I915 and 19Uf, but were disallowed.2.     Shortly after assuming office as Lord Privy Seal in 1929, Mr. Thomas announced that he proposed to appoint a Committee to examine the possibility of constructing a London Outer Circle Railway and that he had speoially in mind the advantages which might accrue from improved facilities for handling goods traffic, and from the relief of congestion in the London Streets by moving on the railways some of the traffic which flowed from the cb cks and other sources through congested areas by road.3.     It was accordingly arranged with the Railway Companies that they should appoint a Committee to investigate the matter. Their report was submitted in June 1950 and the conclusion of the Committee, in which the General Managers concurred, was that the &quot;commercial possibilities of the proposed railways are not sufficient to justify the very heavy expense which would be involved In their construction&quot;.if.     The principal points made in the report were as follows:-Two schemes were promoted in the years Immediately before the war, both of whii-h failed to secure Parliamentary approval. In 1911, a scheme for a greatar London Railway was prcmoted
pruvldingr-f or&apos;a new- railway, 57 miles in length commencing by a junction with the London and South Western Railway at Feltham and terminating &quot;by a junction with the Port of London Authority&apos;3 lines at Victoria Dock, with an extension from Ilford to Tilbury.In 19dij., a scheme for a northern junction railway, 1 7f miles in length, was promoted commencing at Brentford and terminating at Palmers Green.Both schemes provided for various junctions with other railways en the line of route.     Ae very extensive building,  road and other developments;, had taken place since these lines were rejected and similar developments were still proceeding the Committee considered it impracticable to carry out either of the two schemes on the lines and at the level then contemplated and they examined certain modifications which thoy considered would be necessary.Subj-oct to thes,e modifications they estimated that the cost of the works only would be approximately  if, 851,000 under the 1911 scheme-, and that the oo:rreepvndlng figisre in respect of the 191 if scheme would be 432,528,000,,     Those figures, however, excluded the cost of the necessary land and compensation, which in view of the changed conditions would, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, have been prohibitive.The Committee therefore considered an alternative  . scheme involving the construction of a railway, miles in lengths  commencing at Peltham and - terminating at the Victoria Dock, with extensions from Wanetead to Tilbury.     Numerous junctions with
the main lines were provided en route, and the Committee estimated that, including land and compensation, the expenditure would amount to just under  10,000,000 of which two and a half million pounds represented land and compensation charges. 5.     The Committee stated that they had carefully explored the commercial possibilities of the proposed railways.     If this scheme were to cater for local passenger traffic, it would have to be equipped for electric traction for which no allowanoe was made in the Committee&apos;s estimates of cost.      They failed to see any possibility of a considerable passenger traffic being conveyed by such a system of railways from and to the existing railways.6,     As regards goods traffic, the Committee considered that traffic local to the line would be relatively small, and that traffic with other Companies originating or terminating on the line or passing over the proposed new railways between points on existing railways would be in the first case mainly, and in the second case entirely, diverted and not new traffic.     They found no ground for thinking &quot;that the construction of the proposed railways would create new traffic in goods and minerals to any appreciable extent&quot;.7.      The Committee thought that the existing sxchange rail-ways serving London are generally satisfactory, and certain Companies had at the time in hand substantial works of improvement.8.     In these circumstances, the Committee did not take out any estimates of the net revenue which the line would be likely to earn.     deluding the cost of electrification and expenditure on necessary exchange accommodation, the new line would require a net revenue of  600,000 per annum to pay 6/i on the capital expended.     Taking working expenses at the rate of QCp.j , (in&apos; the opinion of the Committee 0 low rate), the undertaking would have had to earn a gross revenue of  5,000,000 or  2f7,6oO per mile.
rj f* rri 15 b- if- -This is more thanjfour times the gross receipts of an average route mile of railway, and the Committee saw no prospects of any such return.9.     My predecessor &quot;brought the terms of this report before the late Government in his Memorandum (U.P. 50-12) and it was agreed that in vieir of the terms of the Committee&apos;e report, as approved &quot;by the Railway Companies, the Government would not be justified in pressing them to undertake the heavy capital expenditure involved in the construction of such a railway from which no compensating advantages would be derived in the shape of increased traffic or reduced expenses.      It was, however, decided that the Companies should be asked for further information -regarding the existing arrangements for the conveyance and exchange of rail-borne traffic in the London area, and the improvements which were being effected, or might be carried out with advantage,10.      This information was obtained, and the matter was the subject of a further memorandum (UoPo jJ0-^) submitted by Mr.Morrison in November, 19?0, in which, it was stated that the conclusion reached by the Ministry ef Transport, in view of the Companies&apos; joint consideration, and the assurances given that the existing exchange routes were generally satisfactory, it would be difficult at the time to urge them to put forward further proposals, but that the situation should be watched and reviewed in any case after the works then in hand had been completed.11.     The London and North. Eastern Hailway Company completed their schemes of improvement at Perme Park and Temple Mills during last year, and it is understood that the Great &quot;Western Railway Company have made considerable progress with their scheme at Acton, and that the Southern Railway Company expect that their schemes between Old Kew Junction and Brentford and between New Kew Junction and Chiswick Junction will be completed by the end of June this year.
12.       Apart from the opposition which would be likely to be raised to any proposals for a new railway by highway authorities and the owners of property along the route, strong opposition would almost inevitably be encountered fro one or other of the Railway Companies themselves who would contend that the proposed railway unnecessarily duplicated the existing railway facilities.     The part of the route of any outer circle railway for which, prima facie, there is perhaps most to be said would be a route giving additional access to the docks.      In this connection it is of interest to note that a proposal which the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company included in their Bill of 19^0 for new railway about 4. miles in length to connect their system with the Victoria Docks was rejected by Parliament mainly in consequence of the opposition of the London and North Eastern Railway Company.1 2.       It does not seem practical result could follow if in present circumstances we were to ask the Railway Companies to give renewed attention to the question of an outer Circle Railway and I see no reason to differ from the conclusion reached by the late Government in the matter.(Sgd) P.

FACILITIES FOR road transport^ACROSSTHE RIVER FORTH.Note by the Minister of Transport,The question of a road bridge across the River Forth near Queensferry was first raised in 1925 as a means of affording employment.     Stress v/as laid on &quot;the inadequacy of the present ferry service operated by the London and North Eastern Railway Company and on the length of the detour via Stirling where the nearest road bridge across the Forth is situated - 25 milss upstream from Queensferry as the crow flies.It should be observed that though the East Coast route through Newcastle, Berwick and Edinburgh is the best known and perhaps the most important road from England to the North, it is by no means the only one, for there is another main road from the South into Scotland via Scotch Corner and Carlisle.      Even were the   Queensferry Bx*idge built,  the Great North Road via Berwick would give a route via York or London to North-East Scotland, only 5 miles shorter than that by Scotch Corner-Carlisle or Preston-Carlisle.In May, 1926, Messrs. Iviott, Hay and \nderson were appointed to investigate the possibility of the construction of a road bridge &quot;in the neighbourhood of the existing Queensferry railway bridge&quot;.      Three locations were reported upon, all lying within one mile of the railway bridge.,     As the latter lies nearly 8 miles west of Edinburgh, it v/as assumed that the building of a bridge still further westwards would not be favoured by Edinburgh and on these grounds, among others, the Consulting Engineers-refrained from any reference to a site at Rosyth, 5 miles west of the railway &quot;bridge, to which attention has subsequently been directed.
Their Report which was received on May 7th, 1929, dealt with three schemes for a bridge at Queensferry site, Site No.l was practically a mile above the railway bridge and stood,  therefore, well clear of it.      It suffered from the disadvantage of being close to the dredged channel leading to Rosyth Dockyard, although the land approaches would have &quot;been easy to construct.      Site No.2 was on the downstream side of the railway bridge and close alongside it, and Site NOoJ - about one mile downstream from the railway bridge - was also studied.     Informal conversations with the Admiralty indicated that the construction of a bridge on Site No.l would be regarded unfavourably although this view was in no way official or binding.      For this reason, and also because borings shewed the foundations on this site to be poor,  tlie choice of sites was narrowed down to 2 and 5.      Site No.2 was likely to be strenuously opposed by the London and North Eastern Railway and the Consulting Engineers regarded the site unfavourebly on economic and aesthetic grounds.      Moreover, in the event of war, two bridges so close together would form a much better target for bombing than a single bridge.      Site No.5 was, therefore, provisionally recommended by the Consulting Engineers, estimates being given for two schemes at this site,  the difference being in the layout of the approach roads to the bridge.      The estimate for the scheme ultimately recommended by Messrs.Mott, Hay and Anderson was  6,110,000 which included a by-pass and bridge at Inverkeithing.The terms of the Consulting Engineer&apos;s report were communicated to the Corporation of Edinburgh and other public bodies concerned, with whom discussions ensued.      The original attitude of the Corporation of Edinburgh was that -&quot;the work had such a predominantly &quot;national&quot; character that
local authorities should, not he expected to contribute anything to the cost of constructing the bridge and its approaches, or even to the cost of maintenance when built.The Ministry of Transport pointed out the unreasonableness of this attitude, but the result of long negotiations has been that Edinburgh has offered a capital contribution of  100,000 only and Dunfermline of  8,000 which together amount approximately to 1./&apos; per cent, of the total cost of the scheme.      Although numerous resolutions have been transmitted urging the immediate construction of the bridge, no additional offers of financial support have so far been forthcoming.     The Corporation of Edinburgh has indeed passed a Resolution expressing its willingness &quot;to pay its&apos;due proportion of cost, as may be assessed on all interested local authorities, if at all reasonable&apos;&apos;, but has suggested no further definite contribution to the outlay, and it should be observed that as regards future maintenance the local authorities make no offer whatever.It is obvious that to justify an expenditure exceeding  6,000,000 for the building of a bridge&apos; on this site some ampler justification is required than a mere statement that the existing ferry is inadequate and that a bridge would be appreciated.      The local authorities have accordingly been urged repeatedly to study the possibility of improving the ferry service, as a modernised ferry service operated possibly by the Forth Commissioners,  should go far to improve communications,  especially if coupled with the construction of a bridge at a comparatively small cost higher upstream, at Kincardine-on-Eoith for instance.     Only about 10,000 vehicles use the existing ferry per annum, and it is -understood that a new and improved scheme of ferry transport could be established at a cost of approximately 450,000.
iC tAnother project for. a &quot;bridge near the ^ueensferrysite was advocated &quot;by the Rt. Hon.. Vf. Adamson, tiecretaryof Otate for Scotland in the late Government, upon thesuggestion of an engineer resident at Dunferinline(kr. J.  oummerville), but technical.examination shewed thatthe scheme was quite impracticable.      (^,ee appendix a. toemorandum U. P. (^0)if 1 ).The consideration of a site at Rosyth Dockyard,about 5 miles above the present Forth Railway bridge, asa possible location for a crossing of the Forth was not included in the terms of reference to the consulting engineers, for the reasons already explained.      It hasrecently been suggested that a bridge at this point would cost no more than  2f million since a design could beadopted involving comparatively small spans and a lowerheadroom over the Forth than would be necessary atQueensferry.     Furthermore, the existing roads round the dockyard, at kosyth would obviate some of the expenseentailed in the construction of new aporoaches.     At ameeting of the representatives of local authorities concerned,held at the Treasury on the 5th May, 195&quot;* * it waa agreed thati^ir Alexander Gibb should report upon this project.      Owing,however, to the financial crisis the instructions towir Alexander Gibb were suspended before his investigationshad made any substantial progress, the Minister of Transportreplying as follows to a Parliamentary Question on the 2prdSeptember, 19^1:-&quot;Discussions regarding the suggested road bridge across the Forth at Queensferry were suspended some months ago owing to the request of the local authorities that - investigations should be conducted into the feasibility of constructing a bridge at less cost on a site near Rosyth.      In present circumstances, however, I should not feel justified in incurring the expense of a preliminary investigation into this alternative project for bridging the Forth.&quot;
&quot; 5 -To complete this account of the various projects for &quot;bridges across the Forth, it should he mentioned that, independently of the t^ueensferry project, prolonged negotiations were proceeding concurrently with the local authorities concerned for the construction of a bridge at Kincardine-on-Forth - 14 miles above Queensferry as the crow flies.     A provisional order was obtained in 1951 for &quot;this scheme, estimated to cost  390,Q00.      The Minister of Transport offered a contribution of 85 per cent, and the County Councils of Fife, Clackmannan and Stirling made arrangements to share the remaining 15 per cent,  among themselves.    From tenders which have just been obtained it appears that the scheme can be carried out well within the amount of the original estimate (say, for  ^4-0,000) and the local authorities are prepared to proceed on the terms originally screed - a fact which in itself differentiates this project sharply from the proposals at Queensferry where the financial support offered by the local authorities is negligible.The engineering details for the Kincardine bridge are satisfactory, work could be started at once, and it remains to be decided whether, in the present state of national finances, assistance should be made available from the Road Fund for carrying out the project, in view of the many other schemes which it has been necessary to curtail or suspend.The object of the proposed bridges at Queensferryor Kincardine would be to improve communications between GreatBritain, south of the Forth and North-East Scotland.     Themain traffic streams might be described as flowing from( (a)   Edinburgh and South-East Scotland. (  (b)    Glasgow&quot;.( (c)    South-West Scotland and England.towards ( (&amp;)   Fifeshire.( (e)    The remaining- Morth-Eastern Scottish Counties.
o n o- b -In considering the value of a bridge over the Forth preponderant importance attaches to traffic streams from Edinburgh and Glasgow, as the velume of long distance traffic is almost negligible in comparison with that of shorter range.      Traffic charts illustrating the varying volume of traffic along a main trunk route such as London-Edinburgh show a dense flow in the neighbourhood of the populous centres but a thin trickle at intermediate points in open country. Thus at two points on this road (A.l) between Edinburgh and the border, the number of vehicles passing was found to be less than 600 per day in the month of August, 1928 - a seasonwhen traffic reaches its maximum........... At a point inHertfordshire on this same road the number of vehicles during the same census was 9*60lf per day, a striking illustration of the disproportion between the volume of local and through traffic respectively.An opinion as to the utility to local traffic of a bridge on a new site can usefully be based on the population residing within a circle of, say, a 15 miles radius.      The population within this radius of Queensferry is 800,000 so that, assuming the cost of the bridge to be  6,110,000, the cost of the bridge per head of population would he  7.12.0. This may be contrasted with the corresponding figures for the suggested Lower Thames Tunnel of which the cost &quot;is estimated at  5,000,000 to  5,500,000.      The population within a 15 mile radius of the tunnel being if,000,000, the cost per head of this scheme would be less than  1.The following figures shew the main savings in distance compared with the existing routes via Stirling;-
Saving by        Saving by Queensf errar- :^Kincardine Bridge. Bridge.Edinburgh esc S.E.scotland to Fifeshire ...      ...       about 40 nils. about 18 mis.Edinburgh &amp; S.B.Scotland to remaining N.E.Scottish Counties   ... &quot;     20   u        &quot;     11    &quot;Glasgow to Fifeshire     ... &quot;       4   u &quot;       7   &quot;. Glasgow to remaining N.E. ScottishCounties       ...        ... Nil. Nil.It will be seen that,  so far as traffic fromEdinburgh in a N.E. direction is concerned, the saving in distance resulting from the construction of a bridge at Kincardine is about half that du* to the erection of a bridge at Ojueencferry.      3n the other hand, while the influence of a bridge at either site on Glasgow is slight, Kincardine shews an advantage over Queensf erry for transit from Glasgow ti Fifeshire.     Apart from the saving in distance, the Kincardine bridge would have the advantage of by-passing the congested bridge and streets of Stirling.The problem of the Forth crossings noeda considering under two heads:-(a) The lower roach;    a proposed road-bridge at or near ^ueensf erry,  ostinatod to cost anything from  2,750,000 to  b,1i-\, uOO according to the site selocted.      Failing a bridge,  can the ferry service be improved? (estimated cost  450,000).(b) The upper reach;    a bridge at Kincardine,  estimated to cost about  550,000.It has not so far been found feasible to obtain any definite and reancnable offers from the interested Local Authoritier. towards the cost of a bridge at Queensf erry or evon to the cost of its maintenance whsi. built,   rtiile satisfactory &quot;tr-n^vngements have been made in the case 0^Kincardine.    The cost (t-f a bridge at Kincardine,  together with that of a new ferry at Q,ueensf erry,   is less than a third of the lowest
possible estimate for a Queensferry bridge.In a memo random (UoP. (J0)lf1 ) to the Panel of Ministers for Unemployment, dated 22nd November, 1 9^0, my predecessor commented, as follows on the Q,ueensferry Bridge proposals: -&quot;As Minister of Transport it is my duty to advj.se the Pane]  on the proposition from the point of view of transport- economj.es,    I am net convinced that the transport or development conditions are in any way proportionate to a capital expenditure of  6,100,000.      The division of opinion among the local authorities concerned and the relative insignificance cf the amount they are prepared to contribute confirms me in this view&quot;The proposition of an adequate and efficient modern ferry service which could be provided for a relatively modest figure and would be of great advantage is another preposition.      I think that ^e   existing unsatisfactory ferry service could and snould be improved&quot;.Nothing has since occurred to throw doubt on the soundness of this conclusion,  and I should not, in present circumstances,  take any more favourable view even if complete investigation established (which has not yet been done) that the Rosyth site could be adopted and that a bridge could there be constructed for about       million.      I would add that it is useless to lock for any radical improvement in the ferry services so long as the project for a bridge is regarded as a possibility^I recommend, therefore, that the Committee should decide that the proposal for a bridge at ^uepnsf erry,  or alternatively at Rosyth,  should not be further considered, and I hope that no further public time and money will be devoted to investigation of this costly project for which there is,  in my opinion, quite inadequate traffic justification. The construction of a bridge at this point would need Parliamentary powers and would, of course, be very.
strongly opposed by the railway companies who maintain the existing railway bridge at heavy cost to themselves.     The Committee will wish to bear in mind that those who advocate construction of a bridge over the lower reaches of the Forth usually couple with it a bridge over the Tay, estimated to cost about  2 million.At the same time the Committee will wish to consider the proposed new bridge at Kincardine.     Traffic considerations shew that this bridge would result in savings in distance, in general about half, but in some cases greater than those due to a bridge at Queensferry.      If, in addition, an improved ferry service were instituted at Queensferry, the relative advantages of a bridge at Queensferry would be even less marked.     Contracts of about  250,000 for bridges foundations and steelwork could be let at once and a substantial volume of early employment provided.     On the other hand a grant towards this project might be criticised on the grounds that it would absorb a large proportion of the extremely limited provision for such purposes in the Budget of the Road Fund for the coming year and that any available funds would be better devoted to completing important works which we have had to suspend or curtail but with which the local authorities desire to proceed.(Sgd. )   P.J.
