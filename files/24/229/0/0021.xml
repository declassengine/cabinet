Tliis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,CABINET. Copy No.   QSECRET. 7SWEEPSTAKES AND LOTTERIES .0 .P.121 (52) .Memorandum   by   the   Home    Secretary.I desire to obtain the advice of the Cabinet on the question whether in their view the time has not now come when it is desirable that an inquiry should be held into the whole subject of the Betting Laws.At their meeting on the 2nd March, 1932   (Cabinet Con-clusions 16  (32) Conclusion 9), the Cabinet saw no alternative but to allow the existing situation to continue, but the impossibility in practice of enforcing the present law in the case of the Irish Sweepstakes, and the general public knowledge that the measures taken by the authorities with regard to these Sweepstakes have in fact proved to be utterly ineffective, make It increasingly difficult to leave matters as they stand.The recent Vote in the House of Commons on the First Reading of Sir William Davison&apos;s Bill, and the probability that the Government will constantly be asked what is their policy with regard to it, is another factor which must be taken into account.Moreover; the Racecourse Betting Control Board Is seriously perturbed about its financial position, and a question has been raised as to the introduction of an Amending Bill to extend the operations of the Board from horse races, which have proved not to be remunerative, to greyhound races from which large profits are now being made by other bodies.The present Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has found it necessary to relax the measures hitherto taken by the police with a view to controlling street betting in order that the police should be able to give more effective attention to other more important matters.
All these considerations indicate the desirability of a comprehensive inquiry into the question of sweepstakes and lotteries and other cognate subjects, and if the Cabinet concur in this view the proposed inquiry would seem to be of a kind which should properly be entrusted to a Royal Commission,H.  S.HOME    OFFICE;4th April,  1932.\
