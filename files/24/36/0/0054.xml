Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State f oivft ar. (Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 302   Min, G)I understand that the Ear Cabinet on Friday morning aregoing to consider the question ciE transportation, and I v;oulddraw the attention of the war Cabinet to a Memorandum on thissubject by Sir Guy Granet (3,T;2916) which was circulated to the V/ar Cabinet on 8th December lastcIt is impossible to exaggerate the importance of com-munications both by land and sea, for upon them depends morethan anything else the issue of the War,     As the Cabinet knowwe have always been at a great disadvantage in this respect ascompared with the enemy, and each day sees oar position becomemore and more difficult.     On the other hand, the generalsituation is such that it is daily becoming more and moreessential that we should -(a) Brirg over the American troops as quickly as possible;(b) Have better facilities for moving troops betweenthe Eastern and western Theatres;   and(c) Have much better railway communications in theFrench and Italian Theatres so that troops can be brought quickly from one to another4At the present time it is the business of no one manto deal with this vitally important work upon which so muchdepends, and not a day passes but that the need is felt forsomebody to be appointed who is capable,, not only of. saying- what should be done, but of getting it done.   In fact, whatwe require is somebody in supreme control of-the transporta-tion services of the Allies.     I understand that at Paris
the principle was conceded.    *he only question now is whoshould &quot;bo the. man in supreme command.     At yesterday! sCabinet tho name of Major-General Hash was mentioned.General Hash is a very cole and energetic officer, butit must be remembered that so ier      his work hos con-sisted in carrying on a going concern which Sir Eric Goddeshad created in our war sono, end I hove misgivings both asto bis power of re-organising xhe whole of the transport as to hisservice and/corrying sufficient weight with our Allies to make him acceptable to them.It appears to me not only from tie arguments used in Sir Guy Granefs kern or and urn but * lso from the factsthat - &apos; . .    *(a) The French do not allow their civilian railwayexperts to operate in the war zones, end(b) Italy has notoriously one of the worst managedrailway systems in the world,that the supreme command should be invested in somebody who to, we nominateothatSir ihric Geddss has informed me/he is not only willing but most anxious to undertake the work.     He has special ability and knowledge;   he has great driving power sad he is most acceptable not only to the British Army but also to the Allies.     In fact, I believe at the Paris Conference it was unanimously agreed that if such a position were created, the appointment to it of Sir FJric Gedci.es would be acceptable to all.I realise far better than he is willing to do how very difficult it would be ior tbe Government to spare him from his present office, but feeling as I do that on this question of transportation may turn the success or failure of the war, I venture to ask the War Cabinet very carefully to consider whether the disinterested, offer of Sir Aria Geddos to under-tafce what is a gigantic work should not be accepted.
The success of-a mobile force which the Prims Minister has so much in mind to create to meet any particular emergency must fail unless the arrangements for its transportation from one part of the line or from one country to another are oxpecitiously carried out, and to do that I feel there should be a supreme command &apos;:,ith a man liite Sir Eric Qeudes at the head of it0(Signed)      mim.20th December, 1917.
