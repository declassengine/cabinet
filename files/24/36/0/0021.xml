:&apos;:  MORAlTOM WITH R^gEHEITO^ TO.immmMi BY -^MR.. PR0TBI5R0 TO TBS PAR CABINET gft^jgj^BJEgT W pOOP PRODUCTION.    Dated 84th November. 1917,After very careful consideration and after full discussion with representatives of the Departments, concernQd% I agreed that our policy should ;be to seoure a minimum sijook of three months &quot;supply of Petroleum Products- for alk Services and this was considered a dangerously low limit,- &apos; I further -agreed that the fuel -Oil requirements of t^hs Admiralty should take precedence.Although this policy was laid ,down in June last, it i only by effecting the greatest economy in the use of ail products and by importing oil in the double bottoms of cargo slearners that we have been able to make any progress.   In spite of the fact that we are now shipping 100,000 tons per.month in double bottoms at the expense of food stuffs and essential materials, the stocks today are still dangerously low;,., and the minimum.figure for safe working has not yet keen reached.   The present stocks are as follows for-ail PetrclQum Products:-	. &quot;Minimum necessary :&apos; for safety. Tons . - .	&quot; Present&apos; -       Stocks&quot; .   Tons.Admiralty	&apos;1,155,000	i 866,0PQ i. .. ..War Office.	78,0.0.0	r     29,397 i -   -  -V Civil Re-quircments,.	391,000	&apos;   308jV96TOTAL	1,624.000	^,S04,1?3 .i  .,, - .i ..............   .....iDEFICIT 419,807 tons.Including oil used for all purposes other than Military and Naval supplies.
Additions to tanker tonnage are being made by means of hew ships and by American steamers but these have not yet relieved the situation materially, nor do I anticipate any appreciable relief for some time.    It is. obvious that all new-tonnage of this character must be employed to liberate the temporary use of double bottom tonnage.The Ministry of Shipping forecast that a reduction of some 8,000,000 tons per annum - c-r 666,000 tons per month Of imports must be secured, which makes it abundantly clear that the temporary and emergency use of double bottom tonnage must be stopped so soon as a margin of safety has been reachedoOn the other hand, the demands of the Fighting forces for petroleum products are increasing.   Almost every new .ship launched by the Admiralty makes increased demands upon the stocks of fuel oil and the amount of the imports necessary to maintain the three months stock must in consequence be increased month by month.Demands from other Departments are constantly being received and amongst them that of the-Board of Agriculture.   The consumption of Kerosene and Petrol as stated in Mr, Protherors Memorandum has not yet reached the quantity originally estimated, while the estimates for March and April, it should be noted, have increased by a little over 1,900 tons per month.In view of the critical position which I have just out-lined it is only fair to warn Mr. Prothero of the position. To meet the requirements of the Board of Agriculture for March . it will be necessary to provide tonnage to carry an extra 3,800 tons of Kerosene during the two months, a provision/which
which I shall do my utmost to meet, but which it is impossible to guanantee in the existing conditions of the Admiralty and War Office stocks.In the Board of Agriculture memorandum, the suggestedsolution is -(1)   to put the Pood production Department on an equalfooting with-the fighting forces, and (E)   to use the Cabinet powers with the Department con-cerned to get more oil imported.-The Ministry of Shipping have already strained the ship-ping resources of the country to its limit, by using the double bottom.space at the expense of food and other products, and I am using every effort that can possibly be devised to secure further tonnage in the shape of tank steamers now engaged in American coastal trades^To give the Board of Agriculture a right to appeal to the War Cabinet against any decision which I may find it necessary to make by placing them on an equal footing to the fighting forces would, not only be contrary to the Cabinet!s rulling, but would tend to revert to that state of affairs which the&quot; arrangements now in operation were designed to prevent.So complicated are the problems which confront me in dealing with the petroleum situation, and so difficult and dis-agreeable is the task which I am called upon&quot;to perform that I could not advise the War Cabinet to increase the burden of its . ?/ork by agreeing to any suggestions which would divert the respon-sibility from my shoulders to that of the War Cabinet.   At the same time the War Cabinet may be as cur ed that every po&apos;-;si&apos;bl9 0r &apos;or t will be made to comply with the demands put forward, by any Government Department.(Sgd.) 17, H,, L.13.12.17.
