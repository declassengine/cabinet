f Adiairalty Memorandum Io  War Cafr;Lasft*In view of the decision of the War Cabinet to reject the proposal of its Subcommittee that 7/- per week should be paid to piece workers employed in the engineering, foundry, shipbuild-ing and ship repairing trades on munition work and to men paid by results, I think it right to bring to the knowledge of the Cabinet the reports which reach me from Sir George Carter, the President of the Shipbuilding Employers1 Federation,Sir George Carter states that since the announcement of the 12^/c. bonus to time workers, grave unrost has been noticeable among piece workers and others paid by results and that this unrest has been prevented from breaking into action by the anti-cipation of some corresponding bonus being granted to them.Sir George Carter further states that in his view the definite knowledge that this increase will not be forthcoming is likely to result in grave disturbance of output,  is the whole adjustment of difficulties arising out of the 12J  has been assumed by the War Cabinet, aad as the output of tonnage must necessarily depend on the prompt settlement of this difficulty, I think it only right to bring these reports to your notice without delay0In considering this point, the Cabinet will have it in mind that an increase of workers in the shipyards is overdue.  Two months have elapsed since the Federation of Shipbuilding Employers laid their demand for 20,000 men before the Minister of National Service, and more than one month has passed since the Employers and Unions called the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that many skilled men in the Home Forces were employed on work which did not require their skill.
The average launehings of merchant - ships for the four months ending November were about 110,000 tons per month, and while we hope to maintain our output in the early months of next year by the completion of vessels already half finished, the result for the whole year will inevitably cause disappointment unless the men are immediately forthcoming to bring about an acceleration in the launchings.(Signed)  A, G, Anderson 20. 12, 17Forwarded(Signed) Eric Geddos 20/13/17*
