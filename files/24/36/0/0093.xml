During the week ended the 15th instant the sum of  894,000 was paid on account of compensation in cases of total loss of requisitioned ships, making a total of  36,971,599 paid on this service since the 1st April, 1917, 3.    MILITARY TRANSPORT - EAST AFRICAoIt has been decided to transfer certain troops from the conquered territory of German East Africa, to Portuguese East Africa, and tonnage is being provided for this purpose. This will delay the release of tonnage which was anticipated upon the conclusion of the East African campaign. 4.   CONVEYANCE OP POLES FROM NORTH AMERICA TO FRANCE.- Arrangements for conveyance in three Russian steamers are being made. 5.   AMERICAN TROOPING.The question of using the &quot;AQUITANIA11 and the &quot;MAURITANIA1&apos; for this purpose is &quot;being considered by the Admiralty. 6.   CONVEYANCE OF COOLIES FROM CHINA.The question of stopping this service with a view to releasing tonnage from the pacific and increasing the transportation of American troops on the North Atlantic is under discussion with the War Office, who have so far agreed to a reduction from 10,000 to 5,000 a month from March next.    The complete cessation of the service is still under consideration. V.   ENEMY VESSELS INTERNED IN SIAM,The Inter-Allied arrangements in connection with the allocation of these vessels have now been completed and the charters are in course of settlement.     It is interesting to note that when the matter was first discussed, the terms of charter offered to Siam were the same as agreed with Portugal, viz. 15/- per ton nett, with a valuation of  20 per gross ton.In
In the interval, however, cljarjier-rates have very materially increased^ and whilst being of the opinion that the rates we indicated were low, the Siamese Government expressed their willingness to accept whatever H.M.Government thought fair and to regard any difference as their contribution towards the War. The rate finally agreed was 20/- per ton per month nett and  20 per gross ton for valuation purposes.In contrast with this action by Siam, the Chinese Government have handed the enemy vessels in China over to a local Commercial Syndicate, who in turn have demanded the extreme market rates and values for their charters, which are now in course of final settlement * ITALIAN COAL.The most important immediate cause of.the reduction in the Italian coal shipments&apos; has been the large diversion of vessels under Italian control from the coal trade to the conveyance of cereals.A great effort has been made to increase the shipments in British vessels in spite of the loss of imports of ore 7/hich have followed from the diversion of Italian vessels to cereals and in spite of the large increase In the requirements of tonnage for loading cereals in the North Atlantic next month.On the best estimate that can at present be formed, about 400,000 tons should be shipped from this country to Italy in December, over 300,000 tons of which will be in British vessels?     In addition the strongest representations have been made to France to commence at once the promised supply of 150,000 tons a month of coal from South France.The great improvement in French home production of coal would indicate that she should easily be able to provide this quantity, and in.time to increase it.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd) John Anderson
