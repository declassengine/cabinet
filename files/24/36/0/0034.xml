Colonel Toneg14-       &quot;IT   **?:*? f/122I DlRTTULATE to my colleagues and to the War Cabinet a revise of the Munitions Budget in accordance with&apos; the discussions which have taken place on the Restriction of Imports Committee. The Cabinet should be under no illusion as to the serious and deeply injurious character to our Munitions Programme and to British war industries of the very large restrictions which have been enforced in our imports of steel and iron ore. As will be seen from M. Loucheurs levter also enclosed, I have succeeded in securing a restoration by the French of 720,000 tons of tonnage which M. Olementel had obtained irom us for the purposes of French and Italian food supplies. This restoration enables and at the same time obliges us to carry out the previous agreements made to the French Government in regard to the supplies of steel, and to assist them in their supplies of nitrate to the extent of the equivalent (having regard to the length of voyage) of 2-J0,000 tons. The effort made by the French Government in response to M. Loucheur&apos;s appeal appears to be creditable, and it is of the highest importance th;it similar efforts to curtail food consumption should be made here, having regard to i he fact that every ton of food, paper, cotton, wool, or other non-military impprts saved can be directly translated into an addition to our steel resources and consequently to our Shipbuilding, Ammunition, and Railway Programmes.I presume it may be taken for granted lhat if the submarine losses during 191 8 do not exceed the 2^5.000 tons a month which are the basis of the revised Admiralty estimate, the Ministry of Munitions can count upon receiving as an absolute minimum the reduced import of 11,000,000 tons delivered here. It is on this basis that 1 propose to make arrangements for the supply oi the armies. These supplies will be insufficient to meet our Programmes and our needs, ami if. either by the enforcement of further economies in civil cousump-tion or by diminished losses from submarines, the situation is improved, tlie first claim to be considered for additional tonnage should be our importations of steel and iron ore. 1 propose in any case to place orders in the United States not for j00,000 tons but for 1,000,000 tons of steel, a,ud to take deliveries of it as and when shipping becomes available. If we tlo not bespeak this steel now we mav never be able to get it however the tonnage improves.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.[1238-1]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET.Provisional.IMPORT OF MUNITIONS BUDGET ON BASIS OF .  ELEVEN MILLION TONS IN 1918.The following statement contains only a draft allocation. A provisional budget and dollar programme on the reduced basis is being prepared, and departments are being warned to make the necessary arrangements. But it is suggested that befor^^n^instructions are issued the Cabinet should consider the views of the Arniy-Council, to whom the Ministry has submitted a statement showing the effect of the cut on the supply of ammunition for next year.The table below shows (a.) Actual imports in 1917 (including estimates on the basis of allocation for November and December) amounting to 12^ million tons.(6.) Tonnage which the Shipping Controller has been asked to allocate to munitions in .order to carry out in full the various munitions programmes submitted to the War Cabinet, viz., 15 million tons in all. This allocation provides margin for losses and delays in shipping in certain important items.(c.) The minimum imports which must arrive in this country to enable the programme to be carried out amounting to 12f million tons. Certain of the reductions between this column and column (b) have been made by running stocks lower by the end of 1918 than would be desirable, if a maxim urn munitions effort is to be made in 1919.(d.) Contains proposals for an allocation of munitions to arrive in the United Kingdom on an LI million ton basis. 11 is of course necessary that more tonnage than this shouhi be allocated in order to produce these actual arrivals.A table giving the same figures in greater detail is attached at the end of this statement.Actual and Proposed Imports of Munitions.Iron oreManganese ore ..

The effect of the cuts proposed on the general munitions position is indicated in broad outline below : 1. By far the most serious cut proposed here is that of iron ore. The steel programme has been built up on the assumption of 650,000 tons per month of ore from the Mediterranean, plus 85,000 tons a month from Scandinavia, in addition to an increasing uppiy of home-produced ore. In the proposed budget for next year rh.c importation of ore was cut to 550,000 tons tp arrive from the Mediterranean, plus 85,000 tons from Scandinavia, while the Ministry was i repared to face the possibility of dealing with a budget based on a total of 555,000 tons of ore from all sources. The budget now proposed is based on 450,000 tons per month of ore from the Mediterranean, plus-55,000 tons a month from Scandinavia. It is unfortunately impossible to make good this deficiency from home ore, and the cut will reduce the British production of steel from nearly 11^- million tons ingot weight to 10 million tons ingot weight, or in terms of finished steel product, from 8^- million tons to 7-g million tons. . If this proposal is carried out, it is suggested that the alloca-tion of steel should be made as follows : (In Million Tons.)	Present	Proposed	Budget.	Budget.Admiralty-	2-0	2 0Shell steel from home	1-5	1-5(Shell steel from U.S.A., not included in first total)	(1-0)	(-5)Other munitions	2-2	2-2Allies   ..         .....	-7	-2War Office and India Office	-6	-6Miscellaneous requirements.(including tubes, wire, con-	-9	structional steel, &amp;c, for munitions purposes)		[    1-0Unallocated surplus	-6	JTotal from home	8-5	7-5Shell steel for France from TJ.S.A.	-5	&apos;5U.S.A. shell steel for United Kingdom (as above)	1-0	- 5Total (to compnre with budget previously	10	8-5circulated to the Cabinet)		(a.) These figures show on the present budget a surplus of 600,000 tons, and this figure would have afforded a reasonable margin for various contingencies, hold-ups in ore supply, Sec, or in internal transport. But, in point of fact, there has never been any prospect that the surplus would be realised, as the allocation for miscellaneous trade was very far below requirements. These requirements are not fully appreciated, but they are vital to the maintenance of the country&apos;s productive capacity, and involve an enormous tonnage. Further, if deliveries to the Admiralty proceed on their present basis, it will take in 1918 nearly 2 million tons for ship construction alone, and, with priority for all other demands, would certainly reach 2^- millions during the year.   This cannot be provided.(b.) The new budget can only be made to balance at all if the total Admiralty supplies are limited to 2 million tons. It is suggested that this figure will give the Admiralty all the ship plates and material which they will be able to handle, with some margin for their other requirements. But these will have to be cut down below their present demands. For example, their shell programme should be sufficiently delayed to reduce it by at least 25 per cent, in 1918. This cut is indeed rendered inevitable by the difficulty of obtaining tonnage for nitrate, which makes it impossible to supply explosive for their full shell requirements, as well as for their requirements for mines, &amp;c.

We cannot, under any circumstances, afford to be caught with reduced supplies at the climax of the war.Out of the 53,000 tons a week available for the summer of 1918 will have to be provided any supplies allocated to American troops armed with B itish type artillery.(c) The steel for the home shell programme is cut from 2\ to &quot;2 million tons. Allowing for finished shell to be imported from America, this means a reduction of one-sixth in the gun ammunition programme. This cut, it is suggested, should be made by halving the importation of shell steel from America, rather than by further reducing home steel output.-&apos; On our existing arrangements Sir Douglas Haig hoped to reach in 1918 his maximum strength in heavy artillery, according to the programme laid down,in 1916 a programme which involved in some cases a 50 per cent, increase over the artillery he had available this year. It has already been pointed out that in 1917 the Germans had actually on the Western front a larger number of heavy guns and howitzers than the Franco-British forces, and even if the Germans make no further increase they will have available from the Prussian front, and possibly from captured Italian artillery, additional guns which will far outnumber the French and British prospective increase. It is therefore impossible to contemplate any reduction in the gun programme.To supply the additional ammunition required for this artillery we intended to maintain the output attained for the first time in the spring of 1917, and to make a vast accumulation during the present winter.Reckoning ammunition in terms of tons, and assuming (a) that nothing is sent to Russia in 1918, (b) that theatres of war, other than France, are reduced by 25 per cent., and (c) that a quantity of 500,000 tons is carried forward into 1919 to supplement the reduced -output which will then be available, the position of the army in France will compare with the position as anticipated on the present programme as follows : 
Further, the whole calculation depends on the assumption that during the twenty weeks of the present wiDter expenditure will be reduced to 17,000 tons a week as compared with 46,000 tons a week during the past summer. At the present moment there is no sign of this reduction taking place. Finally, the proposal reduces not only manufacturing stocks but actual output to a minimum, and even with the 300,000 tons which it is proposed to set aside there will only be available in the summer of 1919, 57,000 tons a week. The arrangements which we are endeavouring to make with America may, however, mitigate the situation in 1919.The preceding figures show an increase over the 46,000 tons fired per week in France in the summer of 1917. But the increase is not so large as the army has demanded; and in spite of an assumed reduction to other theatres of war and a relief from Russian supplies there will be reduced rations per gun for the much larger number of guns which will be available from now onwards.The significance of the position is brought out by the fact that at the beginning of 1917 the output of the Allies and the Central Powers respectively was estimated as follows : Rounds of all Calibres a day. France .. .. .. .. 300,000United Kingdom .. .. 300,000Russia .. .. .. .. 180,000Italy .. .. .. .. .. 120,000Total .. .. .. 900,000Central Powers .. .. .. .. 750,000A more recent estimate made by the French Intelligence Department gives the Central Powers well over 800.000 rounds per day. Clearly the Russian figures should be omitted altogether in considering 1918 prospects, while the latest Allied figures are 265,000 a day for France in 1918, 255,000 for Great Britain, and, say, 80,000 for Italy.It is doubtful if the American Army in France will be in a position to use ammunition on a very lavish scale in 1918 ; but if it does so it will either have to draw on French and British stocks or take up a large shipping tonnage in transporting from America.(d.) &quot; Other Munitions&quot; cannot be reduced. They include aircraft, for which a still further increased programme is being discussed. They also include a Tank output very little in excess of this years figures, but demands are now being made for a much larger programme. The allocation to home railways is very considerably below the minimum demands of the Board of Trade, which must be met. Increased demands for any of these items will have to be made at the expense of the Trench Warfare and other Departments.(e.) French supplies will have to* be reduced by 500,000 tons. The meaning of this cut will be gathered from the fact that her home production of steel on an optimistic basis would amount to 3,000,000 tons ingot weight or 2,250,000 tons finished product in 1918.The comparison other supplies with her minimum requirements, which have been carefully scrutinised, is as follows : Tons.Requirements      .. .. .. ..      4,400.000Home supply       ..                       ..          .. 2,250,000From D.S.A. (including; 500,000 tons shell steelin lieu of British steel)    ..          ..          .. 1,450,000Great Britaiu       ..          ..         ..         .. 500,000Total supply     .. ..      4,200,000The present proposal cuts off supplies from Great Britain, and there is very little prospect of France getting anything like the quantity indicated from the United States.
6. Phosphate rock is limited to 300,000 tons as against 600,000 tons on the present programme.   (It has to be remembered that if [1238] &quot; C(/.) This leaves for constructional purposes, for wire,-tubes, and maintenance of works, machinery, &amp;c, and for all commercial requirements of the country 1,000,000 tons during the year, and covers anything which may be exported to our Colonies, or to any other country than France and Italy against 1,500,000 in the budget as -originally proposed.This figure is a starvation ration and will involve the closing down of many schemes for extensions of munitions work and other essential war enterprises.It has been suggested that we have been exporting iron and steel goods unnecessarily. A statement is attached, however, which shows that of a total of 1,147,000 tons of iron and steel, and. manufactures thereof, which were exported in the (irst six months of 1917, at least 834,000 tons went to our Allies or Colonies and at the most 313,000 to countries other than our Allies or Colonies; but since 262,000 of this went to countries not specified in the Customs Returns, it is probable that this includes some exports to Allies.Since the middle of this year, a much more stringent system for controlling all general steel and iron work has been introduced, so that the returns for the current six months will show exports to neutrals at a much reduced figure. These exports cannot be entirely eliminated, for in many cases they consist of material of vital importance in connection with the war. In this connection, it has to be remembered thai, the growing demands of the Admiralty and the army have involved an allocation of steel to war services which has left available far less than is needed for the upkeep of plant, &amp;c, in the country, and in the budget as originally arranged for 1918 every item licensed for export would have been at the expense of a vital home need. There is nothing further to save in the way of curtailing steel exports.There remains the question of the export of cast-iron and wrought-iron goods. This matter is being closely examined by the Departments interested.2. This budget only involves a comparatively small draft on our stock in this country of Scandinavian ore. In view of the uncertainty of the Scandinavian route this stock should be kept as intact as possible.3. Receipts of shell steel from America will be reduced by a half From the tonnage standpoint it would be sound policy to import more steel from the U.S. A. and less ore from the Mediterranean ; but it is desirable to maintain our steel output at as high a figure as possible, so that if conditions turn out better than are now expected American steel supplies will be available as a reserve, whereas if steel production is lost in this country now it cannot be recovered. The dollar situation in America also influences this decision.Imports of iron and steel other than shell steel from America, and Sweden will have to be cut to 250,000 tons in all. The distribution of this figure as between pig-iron and various classes of steel is a matter for the Steel Department.4. Nitrate. Even to meet the gun ammunition, trench warfai-e, and Admiralty shell programmes on a reduced basis and the aircraft bomb and marine mine programmes in full it will be necessary to take 50,000 tons of nitrate from stock in addition to the 550,(.00 tons of imports shown on the table. This will reduce stocks to \ he absolute minimum for safet)r.5. The reduction in pyrites as compared with the budget as at present arranged is consequential.
we increase&apos; our imports of phosphate rock we have to increase our imports of pyrites by two tons for every three tons of rock.) If there is to be any further increase in the importation of phosphate rock and pyrites it will relieve the food situation by a more than equivalent amount, and&apos; should therefore be imported at the expense, not of munitions, but of food. If additional quantities are to, be carried on the munitions budget, it can only be proposed at the expense of ore, and will involve a further revision of the steel budget. But in view of the serious nature of the restrictions involved by the proposed cut in iron ore dealt with in paragraph 1, it is urged that a further cut should not at the present time be contemplated.. In this connection the great development of basic open-hearth steel manufacture in this country will make available increasing quantities of basic slag for fertilising purposes.7. Manganese ore is entered at 30,000 tons a month. This is the minimum required for our home steel output. This proposed ration involves cutting off our supply of ferro-manganese to America, who must obtain her requirements by direct shipments to America of ore from India and elsewhere. It also cuts off all supplies from this country to France.8. The supplies of non-ferrous metals are reduced not only in accordance with the reduction of the ammunition programme but by running down stocks of components of gun ammunition to a minimum. This involves a big reduction in manufacture, which, if the war goes on into 1919, will mean the reopening afresh of fuze, primer, and other component manufacture in Great Britain.9. A further saving could be made if we could import all our propellant from the United States and close manufacture here. But apart from the desirability of an insurance against shipping risks, it is doubtful if we could rely on a sufficient development of American propellant production in 1918.Postscript. :Since the budget was prepared an arrangement has been made with M. Loucheur by which ships sufficient to carry 500,000 tons of goods in 1918 are to be returned to Great Britain out of the 2,000,000 tons recently ceded to France for food. This is to enable this country to supply 500,000 tons of steel goods of various kinds which M. Loucheur has persuaded the French Cabinet are absolutely essential. If this arrangement is confirmed, the shipping will be used to carry an equivalent quantity of iron ore from Spain which will bring the first figure in column (d.) of the table on page 1 from 6,060,000 to 6,560,000, and will restore the allocation of steel to the Allies from 200,000 tons in 1918 to 700,000 tons.
