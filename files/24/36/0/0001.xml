LI,P,,(Secretary)[alian -ocation.GENERAL FURSE stated that it was necessary to revise the decision arrived at at the last meeting of the Committee I regarding the guns to be sent to Italy,    It appeared on examination that at least 100 out of the 146     15 pdrs. authorised to be sent, were not serviceable, and could not be rendered serviceable in loss than three months: he understood that the sole object in sending guns to Italy was to fill the gap caused by the Italian losses, pending the Italian r*3-equipment which was due to be completed in April nextc    &apos; He found that at least 40 - 15 pdrs. in a serviceable condition could bo spared, and he understood that the C.I.G.S.was willing to spare a certain number of 6&quot; howitzers.
Sorbian requirements.GENERAL ROBERT-SON stated that we are&apos; in a positionto fulfil the Italian demands for Lewis Machine Guns, riflesand small amr.iuniti.pnj it was further possible to spare 40 -8&quot; Howitzers from Sir Douglas Haig1s force in France.These were perfectly good guns though of an older mark thanthose now in general use.     In regard to Field guns he hopedthat it would be possible to send more than 40 - 15 pdr.equipments as soon as the review of the Home Defencerequirements was completed.THE COMMITTEE decided to cancel the allocation made at their last meeting on Scvemteer 28th, and authorised the despatch tp Italy of -2,000.Lewis machine guns 50,000 Rifles ) The reduced total50*000 .-00Q rounds small arm ammunition) request by Italy. 40 - 8:i Howitzers40-- 6!i Howitzers in the month of Dec, 1917. 40 - 6&quot; Howitzers in the month of.Jan. 1918. 40 - 15 pdrs, and as many more as could be spared after the review of Home Defence .requirements.GENERAL. FURSE read a letter from General de la Panouse containing a request from the French authorities that we should allocate 24    -6&quot; howitzers for the reinforce-ment of the Serbian Army at Salonica.     He thought that the French were in as good, if not a better position to supply these guns   as. we were, and in view of the allocation being made to Italy, we could not at present provide them.LORD.DERBY supported this view andTHE COMMITTEE decided that.for the present atany,rate no Howitzers could be spared from Britishsources for the Serbian Army.ckers Jachine Guns lor France nd Italy.MR. -CHURCHILL reported that Mons.;Loucheur had put forward a demand for an increased allocation of Vickers Machine-guns, on the ground that these were urgently required for certain.highest class services such as fighting aeroplanes; he anticipated that our output of these guns would exceed previous forecasts, and urged that
i&apos; I -5-/ - &quot;we should not take the line that no allocation should be madeto our Allies before all British services, of whatever character,were provided for, as in his opinion, some of our services couldbe met by Lewis guns, of which we have at present a largesurplu s.GENERAL FURSE stated that in this connection he had received a satisfactory letter from the British Air Services stating that they were increasing the proportion of Lewis guns to Vickers in their demands wherever possible.     He had been giving the French 40 Vickers guns a week for many months past and in November had given them an extra 15C, but M. Loucheur&apos;s demand was for 200 extra Vickers guns this month, and a promise of 400 Vickers guns a month from January to May inclusive. He had promised to give M. Loucheur the 200 extra this month, but he regretted that he could not give a binding promise for more than 40 a week subsequently; any further allocation must be of a hand-to-mouth nature and could only be decided when the actual amount of our increased output had been determined.With regard to Vickers guns for Italy, we had never promised more than 250 and these had been delivered.   The Italian demand amounted to 1,200, again chiefly for use in aeroplanes.   He understood from General Henderson that in his opinion the French could make better use of these Vickers guns than the Italians.THE COMMITTEE decided that no further promise should bo made either to the French or ihe Italians, and . that the matter should again be brought before the Committee for further consideration as soon as cur surplus output had been definitely ascertained,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.F.I.15&apos;th December, 1917.
