Intelligence Bureau,is the Property ofDepartment of Information.BASf/023.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary. XXIII. (22nd December, 1917.)The Foreign Policy of Count Czernin.The meeting of the Austrian and Hungarian Delegations    has been the occasion of very important declarations of policy on the part of the Foreign Minister and other prominent statesmen.   Owing to the suspension of the constitution in Austria, this was the first time since the spring of 1914 that the Delegations could meet, and the first time that the Foreign Minister could expound his foreign policy before the representatives of the two States; (his two predooessors in office during the war, Count Berchtold and Baron Burian, acted entirely without popular control).The Speech from the Throne asserted with great emphasis that the late Emperor had not desired war and &quot;had only taken up the gauntlet when he saw the struggle to be inevitable&quot;;     After praise of the army and cordial references to the Popefs Hote, it expressed a keen desire to resume friendly relations &quot;with the sorely tried Russian people&quot;: and the phrase which announces the acceptance of the Russian overtures seems to be specially worded to emphasise Austria-Hungary!s desire for a general peace, not merely a peace with Russia.     &quot;But we cannot lay dswn the sword(x)    The Delegations, consisting cf 60 members each, are elected out of the two Parliaments and meet alternately at Vienna and Budapest.    They deliberate and vote separatelt.     It is to them, and not to the Parliaments, that the three Joint Ministers (Foreign Affairs, Finance and War) are responsible.
which was forced into our hands by the greed of plunder-loving neighbours, until our enemies have unequivocally renounced their insane plans of partition and violence.&quot;     Here, as in all recent official utterances Austria-.Hungary is represented as an innocent and peaceful Power, fighting for its life against unscrupulous enemies.    The dominant note of the whole document is indignation at the bare idea of interference from without in the private affairs of the Dual Monarchy: and in this connection its attitude towards the ^Far^&amp;ima of the Entente is summed up in the- phrase--s3.aced.jLn. the itaperor-Hc-mouth; &quot;Ve cant to remain masters, in our own house.&quot;    As the socialist Arbeiter Zeitung, alone of all the press, very pertinently points out, the whole question is who &quot;we&quot; are, and whether it is intended to refer to all the nations of the polyglot Monarchy, or only to those races who hold the hegemony in their hands, or to the privileged classes in the State.The Speech concluded with compliments to the allies of Austria-Hungary.     The fact that Bulgaria and Turkey were dwelt upon with fuller detail than Germany, is obviously to be explained by the tendency to regard the &quot;gloriously tested&quot; alliance with Germany as an absolute matter of course.The answering addresses of the two Delegations to the Throne are specially interesting when compared with each other.    The Hungarian seems to go cut of his way tp lay the greatest possible emphasis upon the alliance with Germany, and definitely recommends the firm maintenance in the future both of that alliance and cf the Dual system as having abundantly proved their value and necessity. Satisfaction is expressed at the Russian offer, but in curiously subdued terms, sinoe it is merely greeted as &quot;giving a prospect of peace, at least with Russia, at no very distant date&quot;.     The Austrian, on the other hand, lays itd main stress upon loyalty to the dynasty and to the person of the Monarch as &quot;the firm bond&quot; of union between the various peoples of Austria and upon the general
o     J     atreadiness for an honourable peace.     Instead of the half-sceptical reserve of the Hungarian message there is the virtual assumption that the war is near its end (&quot;the dawn of peace in the East fillsus with joyful hopes&quot;).     The rest of the message is devoted to the heroism of the army and to the&quot;unqualified loyalty&quot; of Germany.Count Czernin delivered two speeches of the first importance to the Foreign Affaire Committee of the Hungarian Delegation, and a third speech devoted to answering various questions raised by the Delegates.     For purposes of analysis the three may be treated as a whole.As the Delegations had not met for three-and-a-half years, some general survey of events was obviously inevitable: but in this respect Count Czernin was both perfunctory and conventional. Passing over in complete silence the thorny details of the Southern Slav problem and its bearing upon the relations of the Dual Monarchy to Serbia - admittedly the cause of the war so far as that section of Europe is concerned - he laid down as axioms that the Ital -Turkish and Balkan wars and the Treaty of Bukarest had created a situation which could not be permanent: that as a result of backing from the Entente, Serbia, Roumania and Greece had acquired an altogether undue power at the expense of Bulgaria: that as a result Serbia and Montenegro thought the moment had come to realise the Pan-Serb dream against Austria-Hungary: that in this they had throughout been actively supported by Tsarist and Imperial-ist Russia, and that the crime of Sarajevo, following upon &quot;an ever-spreading system of Pan-Slav propaganda and military espion-age&quot;, &quot;set the stone in motion&quot;: and that the Dual Monarchy thus saw itself confronted by &quot;the decisive hour of its fate&quot;, in which &quot;the patience and consideration&quot; which it had hitherto dis-played towards Serbia had to be abandoned.     It is hardly necessary to point out what a ludicrous travesty of the true
facts this is.    His complete avoidance of details in any ease renders criticism unnecessary: &quot;but it may be pointed out that he seems to commit himself to a view regarding the Entente&apos;s respond ibility for the Treaty of Bukarest, such-as directly conflicts with the attitude- of Germany and of Russia to that transaction at the time.    Such a line of argument was however necessary to him, firstly in order to skate over the thin ice of Austria-Hungary^ pre-war Balkan policy, and still more to lead up to his main contention - which he has made the tactical foundation of his whole attitude in the question of international peace - that Austria-Hungary is fighting a war of self-defence without any idea Of aggression or conquest, whereas her enemies have from the first been inspired by designs of plunder and dismemberment *The Policy of Alliances.   Despite the glowing references to Germany in the Speech from the Throne and the two addresses, the contrast between Count Czemin*e half-cordial allusion to Germany and the way in which he expatiated upon the allianoe with Bulgaria and Turkey, would seem to have occasioned some comment *    But at a later stage he made it abundantly clear that nothing was to be read into this.    He repudiated, it is true, in the most categoric^ manner the charge that he was being dragged in the train of Germany but added that &quot;if there are still people in the Entente who live in the belief that they might succeed in separating us from our allies, then I can only say that those who believe this are bad psychologists and have childish minds&quot;.Hot content with this very outspoken rebuff for the sentiment-alists who believe in a separate peace, he went on to declare that in the matter of defence there were no frontiers between the Central Powers, and that Austria-Hungary was fighting for Alsace-Lorraine, just as Germany fought for Lemberg and Trieste.   Pollow-ing up a. suggest ion made earlier in the debate by Count Tisza, he followed this argument to its logical conclusion by announcing tha-&apos;
1.    iiiiniiiiiiiihiiiiiiiiiitpirrnti  ------ ---------------------------2:9 T- 5 -in certain events Austro-Hungarian troops would be sent to other fronts - in other words, to the Western front.     This announcement may well be the result of the various conferences recently held between Counts Czernin and Tisza and between the Emperor and these and other statesmen.     Considering that Austria-Hungary has no less than six times been saved from military collapse by the intervention of German troops, it is only natural that her rulers should feel a certain obligation to repay the debt in man-power, now that all menace to the frontiers of the Monarohy has been removed, at any rate for a long period together.    The announcement naturally pro-duced an excellent effect in Germany: but it is not easy to estimate the probable effect in the Monarchy itself.    War-weariness is so universal, and the Western front is regarded with such complete indifference by the whole population, that the consequences of sending troops to further butchery in a cause for which there is no sentiment might be very serious indeed, in view of the grave economic strain and general exhaustion of the country.Italy.    Count Czernin described the eleven Isonzo battles as &quot;unique in the history of all wars&quot;.     He denounced Italy for her treachery to the Triplice and for indulging in &quot;this superfluous war&quot;, which could easily have been avoided by previous agreement. To-day, he argued, Italy can at best hope for the status quo: if she continued the war, she would merely get a worse peace later on (&quot;This I say quite openly, so that Rome can hear me.&quot;).     Count KarolyiTs suggestion that Austria-Hungary should bind herself now to a kind of self-denying ordinance as to territorial claims he rejected with scorn as simply amounting to a free &quot;insurance for the Italian adventures&quot;, and an encouragement to them to continue fighting on an off-chance.    What he said about Italy was avowedly intended for Italian consumption, and especially for the Giolittians, with their pre-war policy of &quot;Something&quot; (parecchio) to be extracted from Vienna by negotiation.
Italy and Albania.   He then expressed himself in favour of Albanian Unity, and Claimed that Albania would be following both its inclinations and interests if it attached itself in some way or other t*o the Dual Monarchy.     fie thus tacitly adopted as part of his programme the exclusion of Italy from Valona.    Here Count Tisza crossed his t*s by defining that exclusion as &quot;an eminent interest of the Monarchy&quot;, and insisting that no scope must be left for Italy*s &quot;Imperialistic intrigues&quot; either in Albania or Greece or above all Serbia.Poland.    Referring to Poland as the advance post of Western culture, he contrasted the mere 1 words1 of the Entente with the very concrete 1 deeds1 of the Central Powers in restoring Poland to new political life.     He reaffirmed the pledge given by the Austrian Premier in the Reichsrat on the 9th November, that after peacd was restored Poland would be able to decide upon its own future statute &quot;The direction,&quot; he added, &quot;in which she will gravitate both by inclination and interest seems to us quite obvious.&quot;     It is abundantly clear by now that Vienna reckons upon three factors -the influence of the Galician Poles, the traditional suspicions of Polish public opinion towards Berlin, and the present con-stellation in Europe - as likely to dispose the Poles towards a voluntary acceptance of the Austrian solution of their problem.America.     America&apos;s intervention he dismissed with a certain offensive disdain, treating President Wilson*s declaration of war as due not so much to hostility towards Austria-Hungary as to far-reaohing ignorance of European conditions.      Later on, by an easy beau geste he described the appearance of this fresh foe as due to loyalty to the German alliance, but affirmed that it eould not make the slightest difference to the final result-     It must be admitted that there is a certain note of confidence throughout these speeches which is something more than the usual high-sounding phrases in vrhich the high Austrian bureaucracy habitually indulges.
Russia and Peace.      In his references to Russia Count Czernin used words of studied moderation, treated those in favour of peace as forming an overwheikming majority of the Russian nation and expressed a keen desire for friendly relations with the &quot;peoples&quot; of Russia.     tt is also significant that he disclaimed all idea of influencing internal conditions in Russia.     This pious phrase, doubtless intended for the consumption of the Bolsheviks, need hardly be taken at its face value, in view of the methods employed not only by Germany, but also by Austria-Hungary for a long time past to influence events in Russia - witness the fact that a staff of over forty experts had been engaged since the summer in pro-due ing a special newspaper in Russian at Lemberg for the sole purpose of propaganda on a huge scale among the Russian troops along the Seret.    He was again obviously playing for Bolshevik support when he argued that Russia was the sole enemy country which had acoepted the basiB put forward by himself and had denied any intention of ruling over other peoples or conquering foreign territory.    By this line of argument he of course reached the con-clusion that the entire blame for the continuance of the war rests with the Western Powers.He also expressly disclaimed any desire to detach Russia from her allies, but far rather to prepare for a general peace if possible It was with a view to that general peace that he was negotiating so glAdly v/ith Russia: and the way to general peace oould only lead through Russia since Russia was the only State as yet fully dis-po3ed to conclude it.Post-War Policy.   Count Czernin is however fairly entitled to the credit of being the first statesman in the Central Powers to indicate certain broad principles as a basis for post-war policy. He demands preliminary guarantees of the independence and territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary and expressly condemns the idea of an economic v/ar to follow the present struggle - adding
- a -that in any revision of Austria-Hungary&apos;9 economic relations to Germany the sole aim is to strengthen the internal economic position, and in no way to prepare for such a war.    These guarantees once secured, he announces as his aim (1) the reduction of armaments by regular stafees, in equal proportions and simultaneously by all the Powers, (2) freedom of the seas, which he makes no attempt todefine in any way, and (3) compulsory arbitration of all international disputes.     It is interesting to note that Count Andrassy expressed himself as sceptical in the matter of arbitration.Self -Deterroirjat ion *   The detailed treatment which Count Czernin gave to thg subject of Self-Determination was due not only to its growing importance as a subject for discussion or dispute, but also to an incident which created a sensation on the eve of the Delegations.    The Bolshevik overture to the Central Powers laid dov/n as fundamental principles the doctrine of &quot;no annexations1&apos; and of absolute Self-Determination for all nations.     The Austro-Hungarian authorities accepted the offer to negotiate and there-fore implicitly the bases laid down: but it suppressed the second and the two phrases in the official translation communicated to the press and published throughout the Monarchy.     As a result the leaders of the Czedh, Southern Slav and Ukrainian groups in the Reichsrat put a long-reasoned question to the Premier, rightly complaining of this mutilation, pointing out the conflicting inter-pretations given to the phrase &quot;Self-Determination&quot; in the various countries and re*stating it in their own terms in accordance with their official programme of 30th May last.Count Czernin tried in his turn to prove at some length that the iintente had only discovered the phrase at a late date for its own purposes and had since interpreted it in several quite contra-dictory senses.     &quot;The passage of the Allied Note to President Wilson putting forward as a v/ar-aim the liberation of the Italians,
Slavs and Roumanians&quot;, he denounces as &quot;a &quot;brutal formula&quot;, and treats the whole theory of Self-Determination in the Entente sense as a mere cover for designs for the partition of Austria-Hungary and indeed as a denial of the sovereignty of the State, leading to simple anarchy and Regionalism1.    He then laid down his own view that no foreign State has any right to interfere in the internal affairs of its neighbour, that consequently no Austro-Hungarian question can possibly be regarded as in any way inter-national (the very point of view over which the Central Powers are now waxing indignant, as applied by the late Tsar!s government to Poland), and that Self -Determination can only be accepted for States, but on-no account for the nations which may happen to form their component parts.His official organ, the gremdenblatt, has worked out this line in greater detail treating the unrestricted right of the State as a matter of life and death for Austria-Hungary, and arguing that the peoples of the Monarchy already possess Self-Determination, though admittedly only in the limits imposed by the self-preservation of the State.     It also tried to argue that the Soviet has not pro-claimed the prdnciple as a dogma but merely as a subject of dis-cussion.Count Tisza, as was only to be expected, wont considerably further and denounced Self-Determination as an assault on the sovereignty of the State, whose discussion must be refused a limine as nothing short of treason.Balkan Aims.      Count Andra3sy&apos;s  main contribution to the debate was his insistence upon the need for interpreting the phrase &quot;Ho annexations&quot; in such a way as to allow certain strategic re-visions of frontier.     In particular he instanced Mount&apos;Lovoen, the Montenegrin peak which dominates Cetinje on the one side and the Austrian naval base of Cattaro on the other, and which would, in Austrian hands, mean the complete command of the Adriatic.
Without its retention, he declared, peace would be unacceptable. He went on to urge the need for bringing Serbia and Montenegro into close political and economic relations with the Monarchy: he therefore advocated their union in a single State, with a sea-board, under such circumstances as Would mean a complete break with their former traditions.Count Tisza agreed with Andrassy   as to Loveen, and hinted at other necessary strategic modifications to which it was too soon to refer.    What he said of Roumania left it to be inferred that he disapproved of the survival of her independence: in any case there must be an absolute guarantee that hostile tendencies (against Hungary) shall not recur within her boundaries.    With regard to Serbia, he saw no danger in her surviving, if once she had ceded to Bulgaria the dsitricts claimed by the latter^ but he felt grave objections to her obtaining her own access to the sea, and indeed held that the position would be even worse than before the war, if Serbia gained a footing on the Adriatic.    Her economic connection with the outer world must lead through Austria-Hungary.The semi-official Pester Lloyd, in commenting on these two speeches, Remarks that the majority of Hungarian public opinion is more likely to favour the view of Tisza than that of Andrassy, and expressed its inability to see why the two Serb States should be allowed to unite on Hungary1s flank.     It also regretted that no ieferefcce had been made at the Delegation to the need of a common frontier between Hungary and Bulgaria.     This was, it claimed, an essential war-aim, which must be upheld at all costs.The Pate of Serbia.    A very important commentary on these speeches is supplied by an article in the Vossische Zcitung of the 8th December on &quot;Serbia1s Future&quot;, by Dr. Fricdjung, the leading German-Austrian historian.     Its special significance lies in the part which he himself played - in the memorable Friedjung Trial of 1909 - in consolidating the movement of Southern Slav Unity which
he had set out to combat: and also in the fact that he has pre-served a practically unbroken silence on the whole subject ever since.    His article is thus almost certainly to be regarded as a (not necessarily official) ballon d&apos;essai to test German public opinion.    Starting from the contention that a new Balkan League is in process of formation, consisting of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, he assumes that Serbia must be absorbed in it and that this i3 the true   way of achieving national unity.     He advocates a military political and   commercial convention such as would place Serbia   in similar relations with Austria-Hungary to those of Bavaria with Germany.    The Karageorgevitdh dynasty must go, but a new dynasty might be permitted: on no account, however, must the Petrovitch dynasty be transplanted from Montenegro.     Indeed the union of Serbia and Montenegro would from the Austrian stand-point be &quot;a sin against the Holy Ghost&quot; and must be vetoed absolute-ly.     The Serbian State can be restored, but the Serbian army must either be abolished or placed under command of the Austrian Emperor. The only alternative to this demilitarisation would- be the retention of the Belgrade-Semendria bridgehead by the Monarchy.     Serbia must have most generous economic treatment.   &quot;As enemies we have shown the sharpness of oursjrord, as friends and brothers they are welcome to us.&quot;These are so many signs that in Austria-Hungary, as in Germany, the formula of &quot;no annexations&quot; is being liberally interpreted, and there are tferious designs on foot for evolving a new intermediary typo of State - neither independent nor vassal in the sense hitherto understood, but so linked with some stronger neighbour as to be forced to revolve permanently in its Grbit.     This is the fate reserved for Serbia ana Roumania by Austria-Hungary, fcr Lithuania and C-?urland by Belgium, for Polani by one or the other.22.12.17.
