xniT^nj^t,fld to The King and War Cabinet.In accords.ice with the War Cabinet decision No. 17 of 10th December 1917, I circulate the following minutes-from the Ministry of Blockade.If Russia makes peace with Germany, she&apos; will, as a neutral, claim full liberty to trade with any of the belligerents.   The importance to Germany of Russian imports is incalculable - in every sense of the word.export to our enemies, night hamper such export: shortage of supplies in Russia, and want of transport.The General Staff have indicated ways and means of impeding any development of transport.   I see no way of diminishing Russian home supplies except by a system of contracts to hold and deliver all surplus stocks of exportable important commodities for the account of the&quot; Allies.   But it would, apart from financial difficulties, probably be-hopeless to expect that even if such con-tracts were made, a sufficiently reliable control could be exercised so as to prevent the goods from finding $heir way to the enemy.There remains the possibility of Russia actually(Signed)Robert Cecil.There are only two factors which, apart from a treaty stipulation explicitly restricting Russia1s right tostipulating
stipulating iii the peace convention that she will not export certain classes of supplies to the enemy.   This has already been suggested by the General Staff (under N6.8).   Their proposal is limited-to grain, oil and minerals.   If it were thought that this is an effective means of keeping up a commercial blockade of Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Roumania and Turkey, some further classes of commodities could well be added, such as: animal fats, hides and leather, hemp and flax.Russia would of course have to be given to under-stand clearly that so long as she exports anything to our enemies, she must not expect to receive any imports. But she may not regard this as a very serious prospect.. (Signed) Eyre Crowe.I doubt if anything.practical is possible to be done by us to prevent -Russian supplies from reaching Germany except, the measures indicated: in last paragraph of above minute,- But I should: doubt, very much whether food supplies to.any very important extent can be got out of Russia before April or May and on the other hand such articles as platinum, possibly rubber (already im-ported), copper from Russian mines and other things (? munitions), occupying little transport space will no doubt find their way immediately to: Germany and be of. Immense value to her,(Signed) Leverton Harris.Prom
From a bldckade point of view it is important to recollect that almost all Russian supplies - except those coming from Siberia - come from the district south of latitude bb0   Hence, it is of far greater Jm-portanee to prevent the Ukrainians, Cossacks and Caucasians from making a had peace with Germany than the Petrograd and Moscow Bolsheviks.- While therefore     * adhering to the proposals of the General Staff and the modifications suggested in the two.preceding minutes I venture to urge that we should concentrate the whole of our diplomatic efforts on strengthening our position in the southern districts by military advice, by pecuniary supplies and if possible by equipment.   I would recommend that we should pour into these districts agents and money to form if we can a southern league if not for continuing the war at least for securing the supplies,   &quot;We have on our side the Roumanian Army, the Armenians and perhaps the Georgians.   The Cossacks are supposed to be tenacious of their territorial privileges and likely to resist any Bolshevik invasion,,   The weak spot seems to be the Ukraine and there we ought to work up the Jews to the utmost.   They are very powerful in that district and strongly Zionist.   If they can be induced to exert them-selves on our side I believe much may be dcne0   At any rate this policy seems the only ono that has any real promise of success,, even if it be a faint one, (Signed) Robert Cecil.
