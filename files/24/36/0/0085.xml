In their telegram 287, 25th October to Hammond [?Tehran], &apos;&apos;\$j$$feign Office requested Marling&apos;s views as to whether Russians would have&quot;&quot;&apos; isS^aiiy objections to British Forces forming or helping to form a cordon from Birjand to Sarakhs.Such taction will require considerable preparation and we request to be informed of the likelihood oL: its becoming necessary. If a live possibility, . we also request sanction to commence preliminary preparations at once. Secondly. Although much of the supply requirement force considered necessary for a cordon may be locally procurable, all other stores will have to be imported, and an efficient line of communication to Birjand and beyond, is essential. Thirdly. Lack of water and of supplies make it necessary to use mechanical transport of light type and to ensure that route is practicable for their use which at present it is not. Fourthly. A practical recon-naissahce of those routes is necessary, and as a precautionary measure we , propose if you agree to grant authority to Officer Commanding Seistan Field Force to spend money in sinking wells and employing local labour generally, and to send him Ford motor van and a workshop lorry with personnel and equipment for road-testing purposes. We shall also have to make a temporary addition of one or two Companies of Pioneers to the Seistan Force and provide necessary engineer stores. Fifthly. Expenditure on any preliminary measures in connection with reconnaissance route would follow incidence of the cost Seistan Field Force regarding which a reference is invited to paragraph No. 1 of our telegram No&apos;. 277 A., dated 8th June 1-900. f Cf IH Sixth.   We should be glad of very early orders by telegram.
