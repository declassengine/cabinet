SECRET.OPERATIONS.From:- General Plumer, Italy. To:-     C.I.G.S., War Office.Despatched 8. 5 p.rru 19.12.17. Received     2.30 a.m. 20.12.170.136 December 19th.No change in the situation today.     Yesterday the Italian losses were certainly heavy and the.loss of Mount ASOLONE is serious.   They propose to make a counter-attack to try and re-take it, and in the meanwhile they are bringing up some fresh troops.     They claim however to have inflicted heavy losses on the Austrians.     There was no other offensive action on the front except for a local attack on the South of the Piave. The question is resolving itself into one of endurance of the troops.
