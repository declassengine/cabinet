-LF%oiif&apos;:-- F.M., G-in-G., Franco. To G.I.G.S., War Office.Handed in 1.40 a.uu19th December, 1917. Received   2.55 a.in.O.A.D. 731/1.     18th December.My O.A.B. 731 this date.     Enquiry into events of -30th November still incomplete, but following is summary of information so far received :-Attack from North of Uasniercs to4-Honnecourt inclusive was hy five; German divisions and fell on our 29th, 120th, 12th and left &quot;brigade of 55th Divisions who were in order stated from Worth to South.       Attack was not a surprise. Intelligence reports for two previous days had indicated abnormal railway movement.     Considerable movement of troops had been observed for days previously on 7th Corps front. Reinforcements in woeuvres sector and increase of artillery had been noticed.: also increase in enemy1 s wireless activity, the last being chiefly on front Hasnieres - Queant. Enemy&apos;s low-flying aeroplanes had also been very active on 7th Corps front.     Commanders concerned had realised prob-ability of attack.     Troops had been specially warned, extra machine-gun defence   had been established in villages of Villers Guislain and Gonnelieu and other precautions had been taken.     The Army Commander reports that, anticipating some such attack as occurred, he had disposed his reserves where he considered they would be best situated to assist ,sat vrhatever portion of the salient might most require reinforcement after the enemy&apos;s threatened attack had devel-oped,     In his dispositions he gave full consideration topossibility
possibility of attack on Gouzoaucourt&apos; - Epehy front. Troops on Bourlon front, where previous fighting had been severe and vvhere main hostile attack was expected and delivered, were relieved by throe fresh divisions which had been brought up to reinforce the Army.    Details of fight are not yet clear and the following outline is given subject to any correction found necessary on completion of enquiry   German prisoners state attack was preceded by severe bombardment of first objective for from 3G to 50 minutes,    German infantry then advanced in deep masses when German guns lifted on to villages behind our front lines.    Attack on our 29th Division front was held up. To South of that resistance appears to have been effective at some points where the enemy&apos;s attack was held until defenders were compromised and overcome through troops on their flanks giving way.    Our wire did not delay enemy. This must be ascribed to hostile bombardment and conditions of continuous previous fighting.    Enemy&apos;s most rapid pro-gross was made up Banteux and Twenty-two ravines where any resistance offered was quickly broken.   Enemy breaking in-through these ravines was ensiled to spread laterally, turn-ing defences to North and South and capturing Gonnelieu and Villers Guislain.    These villages were over-run at once, and enemy then pushed on to Gouzeaucourt.   Further North attack gained Bonavis Spur and Lateau Wood rapidly, but was then held up by defences of La Vacquerie and Welsh Ridge. At this stage our counter-attacks developed with results known.    Guns and troops behind front line were taken un-. awares.    They do not appear to have received warning from troops in front on whose resistance in case of attack they were relying.    Had warning been received, it seems probablethat
that our artillery would have broken up attack.     Guns had been specially placed well forward for protection of front and to reach enemy&apos;s artillery and.were over-run before they realised danger.     Many of the troops fought well and there were many individual cases of heroism, but others seem to have given way quickly, in many cases probably overborne by weight of numbersj    this enabled enemy to surround those resisting.   With few exceptions also resist-ane-e of machine-gunners on front which broke appears to have been ineffective.   This in some cases at least was probably due to their fire being masked by our own men fall-ing back on thorn in front of the enemy..   Tho divisions con-cerned, including the 29th., had been engaged since the 20th and were fatigued-.    On the other hand the rapidity with which resistance was organised by troops in rear and the enemy&apos;s advance brought to a standstill was creditable-. Revised calculations indicate that total prisoners taken from us on 30th do not exceed from six to seven thousand. Enemy&apos;s published figures evidently include prisoners taken in previous fighting at Bourlon, Fontaine and elsewhere.
