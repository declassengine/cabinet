His Britss   ropsrty ot s Government.)276Secret.WAR CABIHESy.Waste Products as a Source of Fertilisers for Agriculture,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture.1 desire to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the possibility and desirability of supplementing the present inadequate supply of fertilisers for agricultural purposes by a more scientific and economical use of the waste products now controlled by various Government Departments,In the Army, at home and abroad, a very complete system of conservation and utilisation of waste products, both organic and inorganic, is no^ in force, administered through the medium of a branch of the1 QJf.G&apos;8. Department (Army Waste Products), and this has been recently extended Uy the establishment of an Army Salvage Board. In the Frenck Army the same system prevails, with the added advantage that all waste, produots useful as feeding stuffs and fertilisers are dealt with direct by their Board of Agriculture, which maintains a close liaison with the French War Office.     The Army Salvage Board is now contemplating an extension of its activities to civilian services, and in conjunction with Local Authorities (L.G.B.) and Pood Ministry (for products from slaughter-houses), would thereby obtain large supplies of fats and oils.    It is suggested that all these energies should be concentrated in one administrative National Board, cn which the Board of Agriculture, should be represented, with a view to having the first claim en all fertilisers and feeding stuffs obtained, (in October last, it is understood that 1,400 tons of bones were saved and sold to civilian trades by the Army at home).If a conference representative of all the Departments con-earned could be called, at the earliest convenient date, ti consider this matter, which is of urgent importance, the Board if Agriculture will be ready to nominate a representative.&apos; - yDeoemter Slat, 18X7.       . *&apos; E&apos; ra0THSE0-
