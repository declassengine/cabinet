(1)19th December, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 18th December:-The Weather,In most parts of England there was frost and snow at the beginning of last week, but the rest of the week was, generally speaking, favourable for farm work.     In Wales the weather was bad in most counties throughout the week.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Devon.     The Committee have taken possession of a farm of 130 acres at Great Bidlake, all of which is in grass.     The farm is being cultivated by the Women&apos;s War Agricultural Committee as agents of the Executive Committee.Essex.   The Committee have taken possession of a building estate of 45 acres at Crays Hall which has been for some years used for grazing, and will let the land to an adjoining farmer to break up. Suffolk, West.   The Committee have deputed two groups of their members to inspect a number of parks in the Bury St. Edmunds and Melford districts with a view to having portions of them broken Up,   They have also served an order for the breaking up of part of Hengrove Park.Worcestershire. The tenancy of a farm of 198 acres at Frank!ey had been determined after the occupier had refused all offers of-1
assistance to improve his cultivation,     Owing to the foul state of the farm there has been great difficulty in finding a new tenant, and the Committee have now been obliged to take possession and to cultivate themselves^Yorkshire, West Riding.   The Committee have taken possession of a farm near Slaithwaite, which was in possession of the owner who had allowed the grass to run back into a deplorable state and kept only one cow and a few hens.Rabbits r.     Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from, the North Riding of Yorkshire.Drainage.   The West Riding Committee have successfully cleared out a number of drains and water-courses in the neighbourhood of Hatfield Chase, and are now commencing work upon another series of these drains, which they propose to clear of weeds end surface obstructions during the winter, leaving the final clearance to be   done in the drier season.Offences against the Regulations.     The prosecution of a farmer at Normanton Turville in Leicestershire for neglecting to comply with an order to plough 19 acres of pasture for 1918, resulted in a fine of  5, the Bench taking the view that the neglect to comply with the order had only begun after the farmer&apos;s objection had been finally disposed: of,     The land is now being ploughed.Determination of Tenancies.,  During the week, 9 Orders have been, made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 798 acres,.and 3 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 577 acres. Provision of Land for Allotments,     Reports received by the Department show that\,095 districts 204,050 aDplications1    -
have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, and 185,147 plots have been provided containing a total area of 13,615 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Fruit and Vegetable Preserving.     19 demonstrations in vegetable drying and fruit bottling have been given during the week, in-eluding a demonstration at Blackpool Exhibition which was largely attended.Two &quot;Home Canners&quot; and 4,176 cans have been soldo Demonstrations in canning have been given at East Grinstead, Southampton, Bridgwater, Cheltenham and Winchester.   At the Worcester Canning Station over 15,000 cans of fruit were turned out during the week.Allotments Section.   Mr. Sutton has visited Liverpool and as a result of his visit it is confidently expected that an additional 1,000 allotments will be provided by the Authorities concerned.Members of the Inspecting staff visited Camborne, Redruth, Truro, Coventry, Wolverhampton, W.Hartlepool, Hartle-pool, Redcar, Liverpool, and Manchester, and conferred with the local authorities and inspected and recommended land for sub-division into allotments.   At Camborne, the Inspector&apos;s visit has resulted in the continuance of the tenancy of 25 allottees who had received notice to quit on sale of a field ef 2\ acres.   This has given great satisfaction locally. Glass Jars for Fruit and Vegetable Preserving Arrangements, 1918. A3 the result of a Conference held between the Food Production Department, the Ministry of Munitions and representatives of the Manufacturing, Wholesale and Retail Trade Organisations, arrange-ments have been made for an equitable distribution of glass jars for fruit and vegetable preserving in 1918 through the usual trade channels.
KNICAL DIVISION.Inspjctlji^of^Land, (l)   The Mellington Hall Estate, Eontgomery-shire, has been inspected in connection with an application received from the Executive Committee for the Board&apos;s consent to enter into possession.   The Estate comprises 1,0714- acres, divided into 12 holdings varying in size from 38 to about 197 acres, all of which are at present farmed by the owner.   Most of the land is of very fair quality, but it has been greatly neglected and its present condition is deplorable.   The Inspector1s report suggests that the Committee should in the first instance give the owner the chance of finding suitable tenants to cultivate the land, provided they were acceptable to the Committee, and that if this offer is rejected the Board should authorise the Committee to enter into immediate possession, on the understanding that they have suitable applicants to whom the land could be let.(2).   An inspection has been made of certain of the Newmarket Stud Farms in West Suffolk, in company with representatives of the West Suffolk Agricultural Executive Committee and the Newmarket District Sub-Committee.   An informal discussion as to the general principles on which stud farms should be treated was first held, and it was agreed that sufficient pasturage should be ;left on each farm for the numbers of thoroughbred stock likely to be kept in 1918, including visiting mares, but that no more than the bare minimum should be allowed.   In the case of most of the farms, a visit of inspection was unnecessary, as the area of pasture was obviously barely sufficient for the blood stock kept.   The remaining four farms were visited, and in three of them it was agreed that a certain amount of grass might be broken up without injury to the studs.    In one case the Committee decided to serve a formal Order to plough. Basic Slag.     In the Report for the week ending 23rd October reference was made to the danger that certain changes now in
progress in the steel-making industry might diminish the output of the rich basic slags to which agriculturists have become accustomed, and instead produce a much lower&apos; grade of slag - a change which would be considerably to the disadvantage of the farmer.   Dr. 3-.E, Stead, F.R.S., a leading authority on steel, has been asked to visit the various firms concerned and to submit a report.   The matter is now also being taken up by the Iron and Steel Institute, who have made a grant of  100 to Mr. Bainbridge of the Skinningrove Iron Works, Middlesborough, to assist him in carrying out experimental work.    The Marquess of Graham has offered to place land at thev- disposal of the Institute, for carrying en experiments.Seed Testing Station.   During the week 335 samples were received, making a total of 905 received up to date.LABOUR DIVISIONSoldier Labour,   Up to Saturday last the number of ploughmen who had arrived from overseas on two months&apos; agricultural furlough ?/as 1,102, of whom 959 are already out on agricultural work.    Of these men, 106 are out in charge of Government horses and S53 are with farmers who have ploughing work to be done.    These latter men are subject to immediate withdrawal when required for the Horse Scheme.   The 143 remaining men are being sent out at once.The number of soldiers attached to Depots to date for the 1918 Programme, exclusive of the men above mentioned, is 30,806, of whom 19,631 are so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 11,175 unskilled.   The number of these men out on farms is 17,361 skilled and 8,043 unskilled.During the week an additional 172 men &quot;were sent out for training as Tractor Drivers, making a total of 1,820 men to date. Horses,    Orders for the issue of 103 horses were sent out during the week, making a total of 4,321 horses to date.
The War Office have provisionally agreed to assist the Department by allowing Agricultural Executive Committees to drawi rations for horses under their charge from Army Service CorpsDepots, and this arrangement will represent a considerable saving of State funds,, as well as overcoming the difficulties now experienced by the Committees in obtaining forage. Prisoners of War. Pour additional schemes for the employment in agriculture of batches of prisoners were sent to the War Office during the week, and in addition a request was made for extra men to be added to one of the existing Camps.   The number of schemes now under consideration by the War Office is 26, and several of these new Camps are due to open almost immediately. In addition extra prisoners have been asked for at six of the present camps, making a total demand at the present date for1 2,053 additional men.The position as regards the number of prisoners now employed in agriculture remains the same as last week.Women!s Branch. Rallies of Land Workers have been held in Wiltshire, Somerset, Yorkshire, Pembrokeshire and Suffolk, attended by members of the :Land Army and whole and part time village workers. Such meetings have been made the occasion of the presentation of the badges how.given to members of the Land Army after a short period of probationary service, and the stripes newly Issued to all women farm workers for length of service.   Such marks of distinction are greatly prized, and do much to foster a feeling of membership of a national organisation.Difficulty is being experienced With regard to billeting, and this is likely to increase with the greater employment of women in the spring.   All available billets in each County are there-fore being scheduled, so that those women employed by the Forage I Committee and the Timber Supply Department, now Incorporated in theLand Army, aswell as those employed in agriculture will have access to suitable billets in cases of emergency,
The number of women now accounted for as members of the Land Army is 6,957, as follows:-In Training Centres ......:... i 1..........283On Farm Work ..&apos;. i i...........ii,.........5,750Employed by the Forage Department ........46QEmployed by- the timber Supply Beptment....175 Waiting for references to be placedin Training Centres................38Waiting for employment in Depots......... .58ipfai ting in their own homes.............. .1956,957Interest in the &quot;yifomen&apos;s Institute movement is increasing and meetings have been booked for all available organisers until the end of February.     The formation of new Institutes is reported every week, and from annual reports now coming in from existing Institutes it is evident that not only were they responsible for increased production of food during the year, but for a large conservation of fruit and vegetables to an extent not hitherto attempted in any village.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees up to a:ad including December 11th   ......Consigning instructions given during the week ...     ...     ...        91Less 1 withdrawn 1On offer to countiesConsigned to Scotland &quot; &quot;   Ireland127 821,81090 10209 2,119The following statement shows the number of horse drawn implements supplied to Agricultural Executive Committees to date:-Ploughs    ...     ... .Carts and Lorries Cultivators       ...

\)1iV 1The favourable weather of the last feV weeks has enabled the Government tractors to do more ploughing than was anticipated would be the case during the winter ,months. . For .the week ended 8th December (the last week for which the statistics have been analysed) the average acreage ploughed was 8.2, this figure being based on the whole of the Government tractors delivered to Executive Committees whether they were at work, idle for repair or on account of weather, or travelling from farm to farm.One of the most satisfactory aspects of the tractor statistics is the evidence they afford of the general levelling up*   - x ...&quot;of the work of the different Units.   In North Devon, for example, where, as is well-known, conditions are unfavourable for tractor work, the average aereage per week in October was only 2.3 per tractor;   in November it rose to 6.5 and in the last week of that month to 9.4 acres per tractor, kjriutwSuperphosphate.   The returns from the manufacturers of super-phosphate show that the production during November was a little over 42,000 tons, which was either used on the works for the manufacture of compound manures or delivered to customers.     The stock of superphosphate in the hands of manufacturers remained unchanged at the end of the month, namely 101,000 tons.   This supply is distributed as follows:-   England,and Wales 50*000 tons, Scotland 9,000 tons, Ireland 42,000 tons.A serious complaint has been made by a superphosphate maker as to the shortage of labour, and the effect this shortage will have on the total production for the season.   It is clear from the figures given above that the production of superphosphate at the present time is not nearly as -large as it ought to be.   Makers are undoubtedly nervous...about pressing forward-with the manufacture, owing to the insufficiency of stocks, as.they feel that if the stock of raw phosphate in their hands, is exhausted before further . supplies arrive from abroad, the plant would have-to be shut down
and more Injury would be done to the manufacture of superphosphate than by working at only a moderate pressure at the present time. -Representations as regards the shortage of labour have, however, been made to the Munitions Department, but in certain cases they are finding considerable difficulty in providing the men required. They are now pressing for the release of military working parties and German prisoners, and if their Bffortc are not successful, strong representations on the subject will be made to the War OfficeFarmers are now being advised to buy superphosphate in preference to basic slag, the demand for which is in excess of the supply.Basic Slag.   The production of basic slag is being well maintained at the rate of about 10,000 tons per week.   The deliveries during the past morith amounted to 53,000 tons, so that some reduction of stock has taken place.   Quantities in hand are quite small except at two works where great railway difficulties are being experienced.In order to meet the needs of France, an arrangement has been made whereby certain quantities of unground basic slag will be allowed to be exported.   This will not affect the home supply, as it will be taken from accumulations of low grade material, which are in excess of the quantity that can be ground in this country.Potash.   Some difficulty is being experienced in giving full effect to the arrangements made by this Department for the distribution of potash owing to opposition on the part of the Blast Furnace Owners.   Prior to the arrangement being made, this Department was anxious to consult the Blast Furnace Owners, but the Potash Production Department at that time refused permission.   A meeting with the Furnace Owners is now being arranged, when it is hoped that they will co-operate with the Department in disposing of supplies.Binder Twine.   Makers of Binder Twine have applied to the Ministry
of Munitions for permission to raise the price of twine to farmers from 115/- to 120/- per cwt., partly on the ground that the discount allowed to dealers was insufficient.&apos;&apos;    The proposal for a general increase is being resisted, but it is probably desirable in the interests of rapid distribution that an additional allowance should be made to cover the cost of taking into store and selling in small quantities.Administration of Wart Disease.   The indoor staff, District Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of the Horticultural Branch of the Board have now been transferred to the Supplied Division, and a new IVart Disease Section has been established.     The Inspectorate will henceforward be employed in connection with the supply of seed potatoes and other matters, in addition to the specific wbrk in connection with wart disease.Seed Oats. Arrangements are being made whereby it is hoped that the Department will be in a position to obtain up to 20,000 tons of seed oats from Ireland in addition to about 2,000 tons from the Isle of Man.     It is proposed that these oats shall be distributed through Storage Agents and Approved Agents in the different counties.     As soon as the arrangements are finally settled a scheme for distribution will be circulated to the various Agricultural Executive Committees.Seed (other than Cereals).   Although numerous representations have been made by the Trade with regard to miner   difficulties which arise in connection with the Testing of Seeds Order, 1917, preparations for complying with the Order are proceeding smoothly and the Trade -are co-operating with the Department.
Seed Potatoes.   The following is a summary of the purchases ofseed potatoes made by &quot;the Department up to the present:-Class   II    ........    1,872Class III   ........   2,331Miscellaneous   ....       285Total   -   20,241itThe above figures do not include purchases from Ireland, the arrangements for which have not yet been completed.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
