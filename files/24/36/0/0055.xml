G, 316.Colonel JonesGeneral Headquarters,,p*i8r&amp;tlsh Forces in Italy.30$f j&amp;j(This Document jsj^j lir^Bri-^^^ajesty^.GovernmentDith December, 191The Chief of the Imperial General Staff.is all7.Vide War Cabinet 296/9.In compliance with the request conveyed in your xtelegram 47355 dated December 13th,I beg to forward the following report on the events which have occurred since the arrival of the British Forces in Italy and on the general situation :-Until the British and French.troops had arrived in sufficient force to be a material factor, the situation was certainly critical.     The Italian Commanders and troops were only just beginning to recover from the shock of their enforced retreat.     They had halted mainly because the pressure of pursuit had abated, but they believed that abatement was only temporary and the;/ had little confidence in themselves or each other.     A further serious pressure would probably have caused another retirement and this would have involved the loss of Venice and the- Venetian Provinces.As the days went by and no serious attack was made on them the Italians recovered confidence, but they were desperately anxious to relieve some of their troops from the front line-, and. owing to a want of proper organization, they were unable to do this systematically themselves.     The troops were told however that British and French troops were coming to their assistance and would afford them the relief they looked for.During the period of concentration of British and French troops It was not possible to do more than move thenas they
as they became available on to a line of hills N. and S. of Vicenza where, in case of a retirement of the Italian troops from the Piave, a stand could be made.As soon as mere troops had arrived an offer was made to take over sectors of the front line and this was eagerly accepted by the Italians.      It was important that there should be no delay in carrying this into effect as reports were being sedulously put about to the effect that the Allied troops had come to consume the supplies in the country but had no intention of taking any part in the fighting.At first it was proposed to take over the sector included in the Asiago plateau and this would undoubtedly have been the more correct one strategically, but on examination it was found that the clifficulties of equipment would have involved considerable delay, and I .am convinced that, at any rate as regards our own troops, we should have had considerable losses from sickness and from their inex-perience in mountain warfare.     It was accordingly decided we should occupy the North-Eastern sectors (Montello and AsoloVs,As soon as the French troops and our own were in the line the general atmosphere brightened.     There was less talk of retirement and good progress was made with the defences on the Piave, which should now suffice to meet even a serious attack, and on other sectors of the line works were undertaken and. arrangements made with a view of confining any loss of ground to the particular locality and avoiding anything like a general retirement.The enemy&apos;s attacks on the Piave sector have
gradually lessened ana for the last few.   days have been confined to local actions, which have not been carried cut very vigorously.The serious pressure has been, and is, from the North.--between the-&quot;Astico and Piave Pavers.     Here, although no general offensive on a large scale has been attempted, local attacks alternating between the Asiago Plateau and lit 4 Grappa Sectors have been continuous and persistent. The losses have been heavy on both sides and though the Italians have at times lost more ground and more men than they should have done,  (notably on the 4th December), they have on the whole held their own well.      Still there is certainly the danger of a break through here, and to meet this we have arranged, to have two- groups, one to the East and the ether to the West of the R, Brenta, each group composed of British and. French troops with an Italian Corps attached. These will occupy the low-lying hills and other favourable positions south of the range of mountains and should be able to prevent the enemy from penetrating Into the plains and render their position a very difficult one.     The British and French troops which are not actually in the line are being disposed so as to readily occupy these positions, while the presence of the French and British troops on the Asolo and Montello Hills should preclude any idea of a retirement from the Piave.The Germans have hitherto rather spread their own divisions amongst the different sectors where the Austrian divisions are operating, probably with a view to instilling energy into the latter, but they could and doubtless would concentrate them at once should there be indications of any local success becoming more general.Meantime the -season is getting late.. In formalyears
years by this tine the snow would have blocked most of the mountain roads and rendered operations in those localities extremely difficult., and it may fall at any tine.     The question that cannot be answered definitely is whether the Italians will be able to withstand the persistent hostile attacks in the mountains and wear out their assailants, or be worn out themselves, before the snow falls.Consequent upon the relief afforded by the French troops and our own the Italians, have been able to withdraw a good number of Divisions into reserve.     Some of the Second Army have already been reorganized and are returning to the front.Their defences are being Improved and they are trying to remedy many of their defects in training and organ-ization.    The general spirit of the troops in the front is certainly good and nearly everywhere officers express confidence in being able to hold their own.     As I have said, the general military atmosphere has become appreciably brighter and is improving daily.I think the general situation, while not altogether free from anxiety, is distinctly hopeful.I am sending in separately a more detailed statement of events and steps taken during the past month.(Sd.)

&apos;: General Headquarters. -G.325. &apos;&apos; British Forces in Italy,15th Decomber. 1917,Tc:-The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,In my report G.316 dated 14th December 1917, I omitted to refer t ) the possibility of a serious hostile attack being delivered in the Adige Valley to the Fast of Lake Garda0There have been rumours of 2 German Army Corps being collected in the vicinity of Rovereto and Folgaria.We have however been unable to locate more than 2 or 3 Divisions in that neighbourhood.The Italian defences of the valley are very strong and the approaches to It very confined and difficult, and will become increasingly so as the weather gets more severepTaking all this into account and the fact that the persistency of the hostile attacks further eastward point to these being something more than subsidiary ones, it dees not seem at present probable that a serious offensive in the Adige Valley is contemplated.(Sgd.)Herbert Plumer,General,Commanding British Forces In Italy.
