8,   .  liMioal   Referees.   The Committee for the selection of . Medical   Referees held a further fitting during the past week and recommended for appointment a number of medical practitioners in the counties of Durham, Northumberland a^d Cumberland.   Owing to the scattered nature of the population ard the difficulties of travel in the two last named Counties the number of referees required will be greater than in most other areas and further appointments will have to be made shortly.A similar Committee of Selection, composed of represent-atives of the Scottish   Medical Services Emergency Committee (Professor Stockman and Dr. Mackintosh), of tho -Local Government Board (Dr* Loslie MoiCenzie ) and of the Scottish Insurance Commission (Dr.- J,   McVail) and of two independent representatives of the medical profession (professors Gulland and Munro ] met in Edinburgh at the request of the Ministry for tho selection of Medical   Referees for Scotland,   After a prolonged sitting recommendations wore agreed upon covering the larger part of Scotland but here again further appointments will require to be made for the Highlands and Islands owing to the scattered nature of the population.9*        Joint Institutional Committee. The 33rd meeting of the Committee was held on the 13th instant.   A report of the pro-ceedings is given in Appendix IV.   The principal topic of dis-cussion was the provision.to be made for orthopaedic treatment for discharged men.     Owing to the pressure on tho accommodation in military orthopaedic hospitals it has become necessary to provide for orthopaedic treatment for discharged men in separate institutions.     Enquiries have therefore been made in all areas as to the most suitable centres for the provision of treatment and Appendix IV shows the steps which have already boon takenin
ii?, this direction.As regards Scotland, it will be remembered from previousreports that four orthopaedic centres are to be provided of which two have already been opened.With regard to Ireland tho&quot;report in Appendix IV shows that it is proposed to make substantial provision for this &quot;form of treatment in Belfast,10 .o        Joint Ingtl;)uitloriai: j pnnlttee. -for. Scotland * The 6th meeting of the Joint Institutional Committee of the Ministry and the Red Gross Society was held in Edinburgh on the 8th instant.   Minutes of the proceedings will appear in a subsequent reports 11o        Massage,   A conference took place on the 14th instant with representatives of the Almoric Paget Massage Corps and the Red Cross Society in regard to the qualifications to be required in the case of masseuses employed in giving treatment to discharged disabled mentt   Under the arrangements mado by the v/ar Office in tho early days of the war all masseuses were required to be certified as suitable to give treatment to serving soldiers by the Committee of the Almoric Pagot   Massago Corps,.    with the growthhowever, of provision for massage in Red Cross and Auxiliary hospitals masseusos were employed who did not poBsess their certificate.   More recently still Local   tv-ar Pensions Committees have been obliged to provide massage treatment and.masseuses working independently of any organisation or hospital have in some instances been employed with. the sanction of tho Ministry,,   It appeared advisable to tho Ministry in those circumstances to ondeafeour to arrive at some standard of qualifieation which should be required of all masseuses employed in dealing with both the serving soldier and the discharged man and the Conference referred, to was tho outcome of the oorrespond-enco on this point.   In the upshot it was proposed on behalf of the Ministry that all masseuses employed for the treatment of dis-charged men should be required either,(a)   To possess the certificate of the iilmorio Paget Committees
(b)    &apos;To possess the certificate of the Incorporated Society of Masseuses or a certificate given by one or other of tho Institutions recognised by the Aimerio Paget Committee as giving satisfactory massage Instruction, or(oJ   To be employed in a Red Cross or Auxiliary Hospital in giving massage under the direction and to the satisfaction of, the medical officer in charge,tfith regard to the small number of masseuses who might not fulfil any of these requirements it is proposed on the request of the Ministry  that the local representative of the Almerio Paget Committee should make enquiry and report to the Ministry as to the womanrs capacity for giving the appropriate treatment. The representatives of the Almorio Pagot Committee thought that the Committee would bo willing to undortako this provided the numbers were not excessive^712.        Men on furlo ugh before discha rg e fro ajfi.1 it a r y . Servlco * Owing, no doubt., to the pressing demand on the accommodation of the military hospitals which&apos; has been previously referred to a larger number of men than ordinarily are being sent home from hospital to await dischargo.   These&apos; men are entitled to army pay and ration allowance1 until their discharge&apos;takes effect; but owing to the defective working of some of the army pay offices the monTs pay does not in some cases come through punctually and Local Committees have had a number of. applications from men of this-class for assistance pending the date of their.dischargee In some instances also, the men find themselves in. need of medical attention and are unawaro of the moans by which this oan be obtained,.     The Ministry have represented the matter to tho war Office and suggested&apos; that in these cases(a) the man should be-at once placed in. the position to reoeivo mg-dinal...treatment&apos;.under;.tho.Jiatio.nai-. Insurance.1 Acts,&apos; and,
(b) that Local Committees should be empowered to give financial assistance under conditions similar to those agreed upon -with regard to men of the Olass w Reserve.With regard to medical assistance, however,, it is under-medicalstood that the war Office are prepared to allow the men to reoeive/ treatment from general practitioners under the conditions ordinarily available to men on furlough, that is, from the nearest military hospital or from any general practitioner at the scale of fees allowed by the ftar Offloo,   The .var Office are prepared to consider the question of financial assistance on the lines suggested and it is probable that this will be arranged.13.

Accommodation would be made for 100 bods but no provision was made in the estimate for the erection of ourative workshops,   A general discussion took place, and the Committee agreed that the best scheme would be to provide a small in patient Department to take 30 beds and a large out patient department together with a   Hostel to accommodate 70 men*   Curative wor&amp;shops should be established and men who came from a distance for treatment could live at the Hostel and engage in training in the workshops, The Committee considered that immediate provision should be made oy   the establishment of a Hostel,   It was resolved to recommend ^o the Ministry that the Treasury be approached for a grant of  10,000 to bo applied for the provision! of Orthopaedic treatment in Belfast on the ab^ve lines and also that a letter be written to Mr. mflliams, informing him of such recommendation,(b) Mr, Horo reported as follows; with regard to proposed provision for Orthopaedic treatment in various areas;    South Eastern;   An existing private establishment had been secured at Eastbourne in which there was full equipment for treatment, Captain Baird was making inquiry as to other establishments round the coast which could be similarly utilized,   South western;: 3xeter had been suggested as a probable centre.   Mo accommodation could be provided at the Exeter Infirmary, but there was some vacant land near it on which an annexe might be built.   Mr,, Hore agreed to instruct the. Hoprosentative of the Ministry for thatarea
area to go into the matter and obtain, an, estimate of the oost of erecting an annexe*Southern;   The Ministry1s Representatives were of opinion that Portsmouth should be the centre&apos; for this area,   The Royal Hospital was suggested, &quot;but there vn&amp;6 not any vacant land near It,   The Committee considered it better and more expeditious to utilise existing buildings where possible rather than build and asked that local enquiries should be made, on those lines,   It jwas agreed that Sir   John Collie should send a medical officer to investigate and report,northern  Area:     Two propositions had been advanced with regard to this area, one was that Eyton Towers (Northumberland) which stood in an area of 11 acres .and could accommodate between 60 and 70 beds might, be secured^   The consideration of this was postponed until Mr. Ebre had obtained further particulars from General Ternan, The other proposition was that the Ministry should contribute towards the cost of a new Orthopaedic Military centre which was being established in the area with provision for 1,000 bedsfr   If the Miristry gave assistance a certain number of beds would be reserved for its use$   A general discussion took place on the latter proposition and it was agreed that in any cases where financial assistance is given and beds alloted for the Ministiyts use tho right of user to be acquired must be of such a nature that the Ministry had first call on the beds at all times.   It was agreed to recommend to the Ministry that tho Organisers of the Scheme be asked if $hey ^aiald provide 50 beds for inpatlents in a separate annexe for the sole use of discharged men together with a large outpatient   Department for the sum of  3,000*: &quot;workshops oould be erected in which 100 men oould receive training. East Midlands and Yorkshire;   Little had been done as far as these areas were concerned,    Mr. Hore and Sir John Collie agreed to arrange to send a   Medical man to Leeds to go into the question . of provision for   Orthopaedic treatment and furnish a report. North West:   Pilkington Hospital&apos;Th*r&apos;Hostel Annexe with accommodation for 160 outpatients at this Institution wocua. soon be ready and 1 accommodation and ourative workshops provided for tho men during their treatment and training.Orthopaedic treatment generally:A discussion took place on the question of Orthopaedic treatment generally and it was recognised that owing to the pressing demand in  Military Hospitals for accommodation for serving soldiers the   Ministry would have to make some provision for beds for discharged men - If accommodation for in patient treatment was provided in sub centres which wore at a distance from Military Orthopaedic centres it was. essential that some assistanoo should be givon by the Military Authorities in affording facilities for civilian Medical Mon to be trained In Orthopaedic work in Military Orthopaedic centres.   The Committee also agreed that the Military authorities should be asked that in cases whore a new centre is started by the Ministry a Medical Officer from the Military Ortho-paedic centre should assist the Ministry with advice as to equipment, etc.     General Bullock was asked and agreed to discuss the abovo two matters with the Military Authorities and report to a later meeting of tho Committee.   Tho Committee also agreed that it was essential that groat pressure should be exerted to get the question of providing treatment put in hand at once and that the provision of: two or three rooms In existing buildings in populous oontros with proper equipment for massage and. electrical treatment was a speody and useful method of dealing with the situation.North Wnles
North Walesj     Sir Arthur Boscawen reported that Acton Hall, Wrexham, had been acquired by Mr. Opponheim who was going to establish a training centre for cutting and polishing diamonds with a view to establishing the trade there,    Mr. Oppenheim had agreed to reserve certain rooms for an Orthopaedic Annexe. In view, however, of the fact that Acton Hall is ono mile from the town of Wrexham, Sir Arthur Boscawen raised the question as to whether it was suitable for an Orthepaedic Annexe and whether it would not be better to establish the annexe in the town.   This was agreed to and it was resolved to recomrriend that a letter be written to the north Wales Joint Committee pointing this out and asking them to at once consider the advisability of taking a house in the town and setting up the necessary rooms and equipment for Orthopaedic Treat.;ient there and to furnish a report thereon as early as possible.3.   Convalescent Homes.(a) Udal Torre Sanatorium, South Devon, Mr, Hore reported that the rent of this institution would be provided by local funds and that the donors preferred that it should be used asa Convalescent Home,    There was some idea of the place being used as a Home for Neurasthenics but Sir John Collie agreed n*t &quot;to change it from an ordinary convalescent home as originally proposed.(b) Reports were received from the Ministrys representative that there was not any immediate need fbr further provisionfor Convalescents in East Anglia and the Midlands,(c) Extended treatment in Convalescent Homes;   a letter dated 8th December from Ministry Representative In the West Midlands was read asking whether a proposal from the Treatment Sub-Committee for the provision of Institutions in which men may be given needed extended treatment under medical supervision in Convalescent Homes would meet with the Committee1 s approval-.     It was resolved to inform Mr, Plummer that any concrete propositions which the Subcommittee were prepared to place before this Committee v/ould receive careful consideration44*   Prince of Wales Hospital Cardiff:    : an application from the Executive Council of the Prince of Waxes (Limb-fitting) Hospital for a grant towards the cost of the training workshops &amp;t the Hospital was considered-,     A general discussion took place and it was resolved -to recommend to the Ministry that a grant ,should be made towards the cost of the workshops and the usual 5/- per week paid to the Institution while the man is training.     The Council should be informed of such recommendation and asked to state what specific amount they wanted,5,   Armitage Lodge, Staffs:   a letter dated 7th December from Lord Charawood was read relative to the desire of the Rev, Edward Samson to place his house a  the disposal of the Ministry.     He was prepared to make a gift of the property (subject to some provision for reverter if the original purpose of the gift fell through),    The Committee authorised the handiir- of the papers to Sir John Collie for the purpose of inspection and advice as to the best means of making use of the property.
Allerton Tower, Liverpool:   a letter dated 12th December, 1917, from the Hon. E.

The property could be acquired for&apos;&apos; 300 per year plus all maintenance rates and taxes.     The matter was referred to Sir John Collie who agreed to furnish a report on the situation and best use that could be made of, it to a subsequent meeting,Prognal Hospital:   Major Mitchell attended the meeting and reported on his visit to Prognal with regard to the workshops&apos; It was proposed to spend  1050 on erection of workshops at the Convalescent Home some two mile3 away and at the Institution itself.    A general discussion took place and the Committee agreed that it would be more satisfactory to    1 put the money into workshops at the Convalescent Home, Major Mitchell was asked and agreed to *a*lte   to the Hospital authorities that in view of the fact that the Convalescent&quot; Home is two miles away from the Institution the Committee could not recommend that money should be provided for two sets of workshops but were prepared to recommend to the Ministry that the Hospital Authorities be assisted by a grant towards part^of the cost.neurasthenia,(a) Sir John Collie reportod that owing to alterations at the Institution the accommodation was slightly furtailed for a shpnt time..    There were 90 patients in the Home on December 11th and there was a waiting list of seventy cases.(b) French Garden:   Major Fraser had reported that the Chalet was now completed and occupied by the gardlner and his wife,     The working shed was completed and ready for occupation.(c) Outside Recuperative Hostels:   a general discussion took place with regard to these Hostels and the attitude to be adopted towards them.     It was stated that a Conference wa3 to be held with regard to the position.    It was resolved to recommend to the Ministry that these Institutions should not be recognised unless the Ministry had direct representatl on the Committees of same.     That the only cases to be paid for by the Ministry be those passed and recommended by the Special. Medical Board and that the name Hostel must be dropped in favour of the Word Home of Recovery,    It was also decided to recommend that a letter be written to the Organising Secretary of the Officers Recuperative Hostels in answer to her letter of the 10th instant stating that a Conference was&quot; being arranged at Yfhich it was hoped the whole position would be fully discussed,(c)   Westgate, Beckenham.

PREFACE.This Report is one of a series which is being issued by the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour in collabora-tion with the Ministry of Pensions, and has been prepared by the Trade Advisory Committee (Gold, Silver, Jewellery, and Watch and Clock Jobbing Trades). The information is intended not only for the use of Local War Pensions Committees, Employment Exchanges, Technical Schools and Institutes and, Military Hospitals, but also for the use of employers and wbrkpeople, and any who are interested in the problem of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local War Pensions Committees are making enquiries as to tlie trades and industrial processes in their areas which are specially sxiitable for disabled men. This series of Reports is confined to trades which are to be found in every part of the country or which cover a much wider area than that of any single Local Committee. The information collected for this Report will, of course, need to be supplemented by the more detailed know-ledge which Local Committees have already in their possession or will be able to acquire in regard to their own local conditions.TRADE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (DISABLED SAILORSAND SOLDIERS).A Trade Advisory Committee lias been set up by the Ministry of Labour in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions to advise these Departments as to the conditions under which the training of disabled men in these Trades can best be given, the best methods of training, the suitable centres for it, and generally to secure uniformity in the training of disabled men.The Committee consists of representatives nominated by the following Associations of Employers and Workpeople :  Employers&apos; Associations. Representatives.London Wholesale Jewellers&apos; and Allied TradesAssociation        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1Birmingham Jewellers&apos; and Silversmiths&apos; Asso-ciation     ..........      ......... 1Sheffield Master Silversmiths&apos; Association     ... 1The National Association of Goldsmiths       ... 1The London Master Silversmiths&apos; Association ... 1Associations of Workpeople. Representatives.The Gold, Silver and Kindred Trades Union (London, Birmingham and Sheffield branches1 each)    ...      .&quot;..............3The London Society of Goldsmiths and Jewellers   2 In addition a representative of the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour, and also a representative of the Minis-try of Pensions attend the meetings in a consultative capacity, without the right to vote.
(oOLD, SILVER, JEWELLERY, AND WATCH AND CLOCK JOBBING.PART I.General Remarks.Tlie principal centres of manufacture in the Gold, Silver and Jewellery Trade are London, Birmingham and Sheffield. There are also small centres in Dublin, Glasgow and Aberdeen, but the first three districts employ at least 4/5ths of the total employed in the trade. According to the figures of the 1911 Census, the numbers employed in the country as a whole are approximately :  Males 20,000......      ...   Females 8,000In some of its branches the trade is a highly-skilled one requiring special qualities of hand and eye, and some artistic qualifications. Boys are usually taken at 14 years of age, and serve seven years as learners. In many cases this is supplemented by special -tuition either in the factory itself or in the Technical School. There are special Schools giving instruction in this branch of Industry in London, Birmingham and Sheffield. Drawing forms part of the training in each case. It is soon ascertained whether the pupil has special aptitude for this work.Watch and Clock repairing is mostly carried on in Retail Shops where two or three men only are employed, or in small workshops, and these are distributed throughout the country in all consider-able centres of population. For men with some mechanical ability and the desire to learn, this trade is a most interesting one. There is always scope for improvement with resultant higher wages. The work is sedentary, and good sight and steady hands are required. With this trade are generally associated Jewellery repairing and silver hand polishing. The latter needs rather more strength than the former.Suitability op the Work for Disabled Men.The length of the course of training which is needed to qualify a man to be of use in the industry varies according to the different sections of the trade for which a man wishes to qualify. For some of these long training and a high degree of skill are required.The processes most suitable for disabled men are given below (see Part II., Instruction 12), and are divided into three groups according to the character of the work or the period of training required. For all the operations it may be stated in general terms that the full use of both arms and hands and good eyesight are essential. Other qualifications are less so. The loss of a leg or minor bodily injuries would not disqualify; for some processes the loss of one or two fingers would not do so either. The work is generally light, and is carried on under clean and healthy con-ditions. It does not usually entail long hours of work. (13500-14a.)   Wt. 298-G. 134.   6500.   12/17.   D &amp; S.   (J. 4.
This of course depends upon unknown factors. The trade is to some extent a luxury trade,., and has been unfavourably affected by the War. Large numbers of men have been tempor-arily transferred to other industries and will in due course return to their own trade. Still it is. considered probable that from 800 to 1,000 men, if given a proper course.of training, could be found situations in the Industry.&apos; Training&apos;.The Gold, Silver and -Jewellery and Watch and Clock jobbing trades have been declared by the Minister of Pensions to be a Special Trade for the purpose of Instruction 23 issued under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, and the following additional instructions have been issued by the Minister of Pensions to Local War Pensions Committees to regulate the train: ing of disabled sailors and soldiers in the trade :  Instructions Issued by the Minister of Pensions to regulate . the Training of Disabled Men in Gold, Silver, Jewel-iroo-lery; and Watch and Clock Jobbing Trades.In order that the training of disabled men may be so regulated as&apos;hot to conflict with the&apos;interests of employers and employed&apos; in the above-mentioned trades the Minister, of Pensions has, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour,, and the Trade Advisory Committee. (Gold, Silver, and kindred trades), laid down (in; accordance with Instruction. 23 under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917)&apos;the following conditions to be observed in regard to the training of men in the above-mentioned trades, henceforth to be deemed.a &quot; Special Trade &quot; for the purposes of that Instruction.Any course of training already being given or proposed to be given by a Local War Pensions Committee, shall, if the allow-ances or fees iinder Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are to be paid, comply with the following conditions unless in any case the Minister of ^Pensions otherwise determines;  . .1. The period of training&apos; for the processes set forth in Instruction 13 , A shall be for a, minimum period of six months and for the processes set forth in Instruc-tion 13 J3 for a maximum period of twelve months.2. The first month of training shall be spent in a technical -school, under a scheme approved by the Minister of ....   ..     Pensions, wherever in the opinion of the Local War&apos;. -    ....  ... pensions  Committee, .the,-disabled, man  can  eon-\\&quot;    . . veniently attend such a school.   Where the-man cany &apos; ,   - not in- the opinion of the Local War Pensions Com-1 -   mittee conveniently attend a course of training in ai Technical&apos;School the whole training may be&apos;given in.a workshop.
Pi - , . -5:   -3. At the conclusion of the first month at the technical school, the Local Technical Advisory Committee, if such exists (see below), shall report to the Local War Pensions Committee as to the advisability of the dis-/abled man continuing his training either (a) in the technical school entirely, or (b) partly in the technical school and partly in the workshop..&quot; 4. Where the training- is given partly in tbe technical school and partly in the workshop, the disabled man shall spend half his time in the technical school and the other half in tbe workshop, unless the Local Technical Advisory Committee, if any, advise otberwise, pro-vided that in all cases tbe training in the technical school shall be given in ordinary working hours.5. Wbere the training is given wholly in a workshop the minimum rate of wages payable by the Employer shall be as follows :  (a) For the processes in Instruction 13 A.1st, 2nd and 3rd months, 5s. per week. 4th, 5th and Gth months, 10s. per week.(b) For the processes in Instruction 13 B.1st, 2nd and 3rd months, 5s. per week. 4th, 5th and Gth months, 10s. per week. 7th-12th months, 15s. per week.Where the first month is spent wholly in the technical school, no wages shall be paid in respect of this period. Where the training is given partly in the technical school and partly in the workshop, the amount of wages paid by the Employer shall be pro-portionate to ithe amount of time spent in the work-shop.6. The Local War Pensions Committee shall pay to the dis-abled man during the first six months of training in the workshop the difference between the minimum rate of wages payable by the employer and 27s. Qd. per week (or such higher sum in accordance with his rank as may be appropriate to tbe highest degree of disablement), and during the remaining six months of training in a workshop, 17s. 6d. per week Cor such higher sum in accordance with bis rank as will be laid down in a circular shortly to be issued), and during tbe whole period of training the usual allowances for children.7. In the case of. the processes set forth in Instruction .13 B, the disabled man may at any time during the last six months, subject to the approval of the Loral Technical Advisory Committee (if any), give up his training and go upon the agreed rate (piece or time) of the district in which be is employed. 13600 A 2

Where an Employer pays to tbe disabled man in addition to tbe Minimum mentioned above, a weekly sum, sucb addition shall not be taken into consideration in caleu-lating the amount of the maintenance allowance pay-able by tbe Local War Pensions Committee.10. The first month of training in the technical school and in the workshop shall be a trial period. In tbe case of the technical school if in the opinion of the Local Technical Advisory Committee the man proves unsuit-able for the trade, his training shall cease. In the case of workshop training if at the end of this period the man in tbe opinion of tbe employer proves unsuit-able his training in that particular workshop shall cease. If tbe man proves suitable for the trade the employer shall agree at the end of tbe trial period to retain him in bis workshop until the end of the course of training, provided that if either party desire for some substantial reason at any time to terminate tbe agreement the case shall be referred for settle-ment to the Local Technical Advisory Committee, who shall have power after hearing evidence to advise that tbe agreement be terminated. Where no such Local Technical Advisory Committee exists the matter may, if tbe Local War Pensions Committee so desire, be referred to the Trade Advisory Committee (Gold, Silver, and Kindred Trades).Local Technical Advisory Committee.11.

N.B. Instruction 5 should be read in connection with Schedule IV., paragraph 7, to be found on p. 21 of the instruc-tions on the training and treatment of disabled men under Article 6 of the Eoyal Warrant of March 29th, 1917, which runs as follows: &quot;The employer shall, during any part of the period of training, pay the man such wage if any, as represents the net value of the man&apos;s work to the employer and the allow-ance paid to the man under instruction 34 shall be reduced by the amount of such wage or any portion thereof.&quot;Thus for instance in the Gold, Silver and Kindred Trades a disabled man with no children would, if he were trained entirely in a workshop, receive during the first thirteen weeks of his train-ing 5s. from his employer and 22s. Qd. from the Local Committee, from the 14th to the 26th week 10s. from his employer and 17s. Qd. from his Committee, and if his training is for 12 months then from the 27th to the 52nd week he will receive 15s. from his employer and 17s. 6*7. from the Committee.Instruction 8 lays down that if the employer chooses to pay the disabled man more than this minimum wage this would be an extra payment for the disabled man and would not affect the maintenance allowance payable from tbe Local War Pensions Committee.During the whole period of training the pension to the disabled man is withdrawn and he receives in substitution the full maiin-tenance allowance (see below). When his training is completed tbe Maintenance Allowance ceases and tbe man receives his pension again.Technical Schools.The Trade Advisory Committee suggest that centres for train-ing men in the Gold, Silver and Jewellery trades should be estab-lished in London, Birmingham and Sheffield, and that a course in Watch and Clock repairing should be established at the North-amp ton Institute, Clerkenwell, E.C.Hours of Work.The hours are usually about 50 per week with some overtime when busy.Wages.For ordinary journeymen the wages vary according to the work done and the special skill required, in many operations piece work rates are customary; but it may be stated in general terms that a man whose disabilities were not such as to handicap him for this work should after 12 months&apos; training earn about 50s. per week.Advisory Wages Boards.Advisory Wages Boards are being established by the Minister of Labour to give advice as to the wages to be paid to disabled
sanors and soldiers, having regard to the nature of their dis-ability. Where, however, a Local Technical Advisory Com-mittee has been set up for any industry for any area, it has been decided by the Minister of Labour that any dispute or difficulty in regard to the wages to be paid to disabled sailors and soldiers in that industry and area shall be referred to the Local Technical Advisory Committee, and not to the Advisory Wages Board. If the Local Technical Advisory Committee cannot arrive at a conclusion the matter shall be referred to the Trade Advisory Committee (Gold, Silver, and Kindred Trades).It is to be noted that this provision will apply not only to men who are being or have been trained, but also to any men who are being or who propose to be employed in that particular industry in the area !in question.Maintenance During Training.A disabled man, if eligible to be given training by his Local War Pensions Committee, may receive during the course of training an allowance as specified in Instruction 6 above, with additional allowances for children at the rate of 5.?. for the first, 4s. 2d. for the second, 3*. 4.d. for the third, and 2s. Qd. for each subsequent child, and if this training necessitates his living away from home, and he is married, a further allowance of 13s. 9d. (more if he is a non-commissioned officer) is given for his wife together with children&apos;s allowance at the rate mentioned above. In addition to this any fees, in respect of training will be paid by the Minister, and at the end of it an amount equal to bs. for each week the training lasted will be paid by the Ministry to the man as a bonus for satisfac-tory attendance.Applications for Disabled Men.Applications for or on behalf of individual disabled men wish-ing to be trained, or from employers wishing to train such disabled men should be addressed to the Local War Pensions Committee for the area in which the applicant resides.Enquiries.Any questions upon which a Local War Pensions Committee may be in doubt should be referred by them to the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Millbank, S.W.1.Any suggestious or enquiries other than those from Local War Pensions Committee arising out of the technical matters dealt a\ith in this Report should be addressed to the Trade Advisory Committee Branch (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) Employment Department, Ministry of Labour, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, Westminster, S.W.1.&apos;Printed under the authority of His Maiesty&apos;s Stationery Office By DARLING and SON, Limited, Bacon Street, K,2.

PREFACE.This report is one of a series which is being issued by the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour in collabora-tion with the Ministry of Pensions, and has been prepared by the Trade Advisory Committee (Dental Mechanics). The information is intended not only for the use of Local War Pensions Com-mittees, Employment Exchanges, Technical Schools and Insti-tutes, and Military Hospitals, but also for the use of Employers and Workpeople and any who are interested in the problem of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local War Pensions Committees are making enquiries as to the Trade and Industrial processes in their areas which are especially suitable for disabled men. This series of Reports is confined to trades which are to be found in every part of the country, or which, cover a much wider area than that of any Local Committee. The information collected for this Report will, of course, need to be supplemented by the more detailed knowledge which Local Committees have already in their possession or will be able t acquire in regard to their own local conditions.TRADE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (DISABLED SAILORSAND SOLDIERS).A Trade Advisory Committee has been set up by the Ministry of Labour, in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions, to advise these Departments as to the conditions under which the training of disabled men as Dental Mechanics can best be given, the best methods of training, the suitable centres for it, and generally to secure uniformity in the training of disabled men. The Committee consists of 5 representatives nominated by the British Dental Association.DENTAL MECHANICS. Part I. General Remarks.The Dental Mechanic is as a rule employed in the private laboratory of a dentist to make dentures (artificial teeth), crowns for natural teeth, splints for fractured jaws, and various other dental appliances for individual patients in accordance Avith the directions of the dentist. Sometimes a dentist employs two or th ree or even more mechanics, sometimes only one. Ihe propor-tionate number employed per dentist tends to be greater in the North of England than in London.Before a man can become a good mechanic, he has to acquire skill in certain technical processes. These processes include the handling of plaster of Paris as used in the making of fine casts, the melting and casting of metals,, the accurate fitting of sheet metal to irregular surfaces, the use of the blow-pipe, wax model-ling, the manufacture and polishing of vulcanite, and the exact and artistic adaptation of porcelain teeth to the needs of cases, no one of which is exactly like another.
All this requires patience and application, and nuich practice under competent instruction; but tbe work offers attraction in the variety of its technique, in the ingenuity and initiative for which it affords opportunities, and in the certainty of a good and steady wage in the case of a man possessing aptitude and character.Suitability Or the Work for Disabled Men. -The work requires quick intelligence and delicacy of touch, resembling in this respect certain branches of the jewellery trade. Mechanical aptitude is necessary, and men should only be selected who can give evidence of the possession of some skill in handi-(raft, or who have not lost, through age or previous occupation, the capacity for acquiring such skill.The work is largely clone sitting, but a man must be able to do a little walking and also to stand at intervals at his work, without support from his hands. In some laboratories a treadle has to be used for polishing.The use of both arms and both wrists is required, though the loss of a few fingers would not necessarily disqualify, provided the man has the full use of the thumb and first two fingers on the right hand, and of at least the thumb and first finger of the left hand, so that he can exercise a firm grip with both hands. Good eyesight in at least one eye is necessary.The work is light, though a little hammering is involved, and sufficient strength to close a vice or press-is necessary. It is done indoors, and is only suitable for men who are free from tuberculosis.The dental mechanic does not as a rule spend his time in a workshop under constant supervision, but works, often alone, in the laboratory of a private house; and he must therefore possess the qualities of character and disposition necessary for employ-ment under such conditions.Prospects.The work has recently been taken up to some extent by women, but there is likely to be a demand for a limited number of men to fill vacancies caused by war casualties, and it is possible that there may be a considerably larger demand in the future.Wages and Hours op Work.The average-wage earned by a fully qualified dental mechanic is  2 10s. a week.The h ours are usually 8 per day.Part II. Training.Dental Mechanics has been declared by the Minister of Pensions to be a special trade for the purposes of Instruction 23 issued under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, and the following  additional  Instructions have been issued by the(13780 11 a.)

Minister of Pensions to Local War Pensions Committees to regu-late the training of disabled sailors and soldiers in Dental Mechanics.Instructions Issued by the Minister oe Pensions to Uegu-late the training of disabled men in dental mechanics. In order that the training of disabled men niay be so regulated as not to conflict with the interests of employers and employed in the trade, the Minister of Pensions has, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour and the Trade Advisory Committee (Dental Mechanics), laid down, in accordance with Instruction 23 under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, the following conditions to be observed in regard to the training of men in the above-mentioned trade, henceforth to be deemed a &quot; Special Trade &quot; for the purposes of that Instruction.Any course of training already being given or proposed to be given by a Local War Pensions Committee shall, if the allowances or fees under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are to be paid, comply with the following conditions unless, in any case, the Minister of Pensions otherwise determines:  1. The maximum period of training as a dental mechanic shall be one year. 2. This period may be spent either (a) wholly in a technical school or similar institute under ascheme approved by the Minister of Pensions; or (6) during the first six months in a technical school or similar institute followed by six months in the private laboratory of a registered dental practitioner, provided that the facilities for instruction are adequate&quot;5&quot;; or (c) in areas where there is no technical school or similar institute or where such school or institute is not reasonably accessible to the man, wholly in the private laboratory of a registered dental practitioner, pro-vided that the facilities for instruction are adequate.*3. The first month of training whether in the technical school or in the private laboratory shall be regarded as a trial period. In the case of technical school training, if in the opinion of the Local Technical Advisory Committee the man is unsuitable for the trade his training shall cease at the end of this trial period. In the case of private laboratory teaching, if in the opinion of the dentist the man is unsuitable his training in, that private labora-tory shall cease at the end of this trial period. If the man prove suitable at the end of the trial period the dentist shall agree to retain him until the end of the period of training, provider! that if either party desires for some substantial reason at any time io terminate the agreement the case shall be referred to the Local Technical Advisory Committee, if any, which shall have power after inquiry to terminate the agreement. Where th ere is no Local Technical Advisoiy Committee for the area* For particulars as to the course of instruction and the equipment recoiii-ruended to the Minister of Pensions by the Trade&apos; Advisory Committee, sec page 7.
concerned, the case may, if the Local War Pensions Committee so desire, be referred to the Trade Advisory Committee (Dental Mechanics).4. Where training is given by a registered dental practitioner in his own laboratory the employer shall pay the man the follow-ing sums, viz.:  (i) During the first six months of the man&apos;s training where the whole training is given in the private laboratory no payment shall be made, (ii) During the 7th, 8th and 9th months of the man&apos;s train-ing (whether the first six months have been spent in a recognised teaching institution or in a private laboratory) the sum of 10s. a week.(iii) During the 10th, 11th and 12th months&quot; of the man&apos;straining the sum of 155. a week.(iv) After the completion of the 12th month of training, ifthe man is retained in the employment of the regis-tered practitioner, he shall agree to pay him a minimum sum of 305. a week.o. The Local War Pensions Committee shall pay to the disabled man during the whole twelve months of training in a workshop the difference between the minmium rate of wages (if any) pay-able by the employer and 21s. Qd. per week (or such higher sum in accordance with his rank as may be appropriate to the highest degree of disablement).6. Where in any case during the course of training the employer pays the disabled man a weekly sum in addition to the minimum wage as a bonus for increased efficiency, any such bonus or weekly sum shall not be taken into consideration in calculating the amount of the maintenance allowance payable.7. Where any training for disabled men as Dental Mechanics has been approved by the Minister of Pensions, and where the Minister of Labour on the advice of the Trade Advisory Com-niittee (Dental Mechanics) has set up for the area in which the training is to be given a Local Technical Advisory Committee consisting of registered dentists, then, provided such Committee is recognised by the Minister of Pensions, after consultation with the Minister of Labour, as representative of the Trade in the area, the Local War Pensions Committee by whom the training is arranged shall consult this Local Technical Advisory Committee in regard to the following points :  (a) the selection of candidates for training, with regard to their suitability for the trade;(6) the suitability of the training offered in technical schools or similar institutions;(a) the suitability of any requests made by employers to the Local War Pensions Committee in whose area the training is being given for the supply of men for ein-ployment after training, with special reference to the prospects of permanent employment, and the rate of wages offered at the termination of the training;
(d) the suitability of the training offered in the privatelaboratories of registered dental practitioners;(e) any other technical points arising out of the training ofdisabled men for this trade.8. Where an application is made by a registered dentist to train a man in his private laboratory, and where there is no Local Technical Advisory Committee for the area concerned, the Local War Pensions Committee shall be satisfied that instruction can be adequately given by the practitioner in question, and for this purpose they shall consult the Secretary of the Branch Council of the British Dental Association. (The address of the Branch Council may be obtained from the Central Office of the Asso-ciation, 19, Hanover Square, London, W.l.)9. The Local Technical Advisory Committee shall inform the Local War Pensions Committee and the Trade Advisory Com-mittee (Dental Mechanics) if at any time, in their opinion, a sufficient number of men have been trained in Dental Mechanics in the area with which they are familiar, having regard to the number of men which the trade in that area could reasonably be expected to absorb.IY.B. Instruction 4 above should be read in connection with Schedule IV. paragraph 7, to be found on page 21 of the in-structions on the Training and Treatment of disabled men under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March 29th, 1917, which runs as&quot; follows:  &quot; The employer shall during any part of the period of training pay man such wage, if any, as represents the net value of the man&apos;s work to the employer, and the allowance paid to the man under Instruction 34 shall be reduced by the amount of such wage or any portion thereof.&quot;Thus, for instance, in Dental Mechanics a disabled man with no children would receive during the first six months of his training 27,5. 6d a week from his Local War Pensions Committee; during the 7th, 8th and 9th months 10s. from his employer and 17s. Qd. from his Local Committee; during the 10th, 11th and .12th months 15s. from his employer and 12s. Qd. from the Committee.Instruction 5 lays down that if the employer chooses to pay the disabled man more than this minimum wage this would be an oxtra payment for the disabled man and would not affect the Maintenance Allowance pajrable by the Local War Pensions Committee.During the whole time that a disabled man is under training his pension is temporarily withdrawn and he receives the full Maintenance Allowance (see page 8) from the Local War Pensions Committee in substitution for his pension. .As soon as his training is finished, the Maintenance Allowance will be withdrawn and the man will receive his pension again.
II 7Technical Schools. The Trade Advisory Committee (Dental Mechanics) has also made the following recommendations: That Technical school classes should be established as soon as possible in three centres in England and Wales, viz., in London, in Leeds, and in either Liverpool or Manchester; one centre in Scotland, viz., in either Glasgow or Edinburgh; and one centre in Ireland.Syllabus of Training.The Trade Advisory Committee (Dental Mechanics) has pre-pared the following Syllabus specifying the kind of instruction and equipment desirable for the training of disabled: men whether in Technical Schools or in the private laboratories of registered dental practitioners.The Syllabus is intended to be a guide to Local War Pensions Committees, Local Technical Advisory Committees^ and other bodies who may be interested in the training of disabled men, as to the lines on which training should be given.(a) Course of Instruction.The course of instruction should include at least the following, viz.:  1. Plaster of Paris Work.   Pouring, separating, trimming, hardening models.2. Impression Trays.   Making of routine and special swag-ing, casting.3. Articulators, making and use of.4.

AIRCRAFT  MANUFACTURE.FUSILAGE MAKING AND ERECTION OF ENGINEON FUSILAGE.General Remarks.The manufacture of aeroplanes is a comparatively new industry, but during recent years very great progress has been made in its organisation. It is now widely distributed throughout the country, especially in and on the outskirts of large towns, and openings may therefore present themselves near the homes of disabled men.In the construction of an aeroplane the principal parts are the engine, the woodwork of the planes, etc., the wiring, assembling and erecting of planes, elevators, fusilages, etc. There is a considerable amount of hand work in addition to the machine operations, both of which would be suitable for disabled men, provided they are able to stand and, in some cases, able to climb. The Wood-working processes on the whole are not heavy.The building of the engine and the general engineering operations will be dealt with in a separate Report.Suitability oe the Work for Disabled Men.The following is a list of the processes suitable for disabled men:  1. Wood-working machines : setting up and operating. 2. Finishing Wood-work. -3. Assembling and Erecting.Processes.1. Wood-working Machines, and 2. Finishing Wood-work.All the operations generally require that the man must be able to stand for the greater part of the time, but the loss of one leg would not necessarily disqualify, provided the man has a good artificial limb and is able to move about fairly freely. The man must be able to apply a certain grip with one hand and partial use of the other hand is necessary.   Fair eyesight is required.The machine processes are not generally suitable for men suffering from shell shock.3. Assembling and Erecting.These processes are not suitable for men unable to climb freely in and out of the body of the aeroplane. Full use of both hands and arms is required but the loss of one or two fingers would not necessarily disqualify. Good average eyesight is required. Me-chanical aptitude, and dexterity are useful qualifications.Prospects.There is a great demand for suitable men at the present time and it is believed that the future developments of the industry will ensure a reasonable prospect of continuity of employment after the war.
Admission of Disabled Men.It lias been arranged- by the Trade Advisory Committee that disabled men may be admitted into tbe Trade either-i For a limited graduated course of training in certain operations, without the maintenance allowance payable by tbe Ministry of Pensions ; or ii. For a full three years&apos; course of training, during the first half of which the Maintenance Allowance (see page 10) will be payable by the Ministry of Pensions.The arrangements under Scheme I. are as follows : -SCHEME I.1. Disabled Sailors and Soldiers may be introduced into tbe Wood-working shops in Aircraft Manufacture on any repetition -work, and should follow a graduated course of training in processes selected from tbe following operations : (a) Pullers off, operators of. jig saws, copying machines, boringmachines, band saws, thicknesser machines, small circular saws, sand-papering machines, wood lathes and similar types of machine.(b) Cleaning out spars and compression ribs, cleaning up struts,and those operations on . planes, elevators, flaps, fusilages, &amp;c. which do not necessitate the use of edge tools. (A typical list of such operations is given in Appendix A.)2. The length of this course of training shall be 12 months.3. The starting wage shall be the pre-war rate of wages current in the district for labourers, and shall advance at the rate of Id. per hour every 2 months during the period of training (that is an increase of 2^d. per hour in all).4. The recognised district war advances in the trade shall be paid in addition to tbe rates mentioned at each stage of the period of training.5. The disabled man will be subject to the ordinary conditions of the factory or workshop in regard to overtime rates, deductions for . lost time, &amp;c.6. Employers who engage disabled men must report such engagement to tbe Local War Pensions Committee for the area in which the man is employed.7. A disabled man engaged by an employer under this Scheme shall be eligible to apply for transfer to the full coarse of training mentioned in Scheme II.

Training in Aircraft Manufacture (Fusilage Making and Erection of Engine on Fusilage) may only be given where the employer undertakes to give the disabled man an all-round knowledge of the trade.(N.B. For the list of operations which the Trade Advisorv Committee has suggested to the Minister of Pensions as desirable to be included in this training see Appendices B aud C.)2. The period of training shall be three years unless the Minister of Pensions, on the advice of the Trade Advisory Committee, determines otherwise. The first eighteen months shall be a period of training with maintenance, the second eighteen months shall be an improver&apos;s period without maintenance.3.

Note 1.-The usual allowances for children will be payable during the whol s-period of Training under Maintenance.v -maris disabilities are such as not to require further medical treat-ment, and where the usual hours and conditions of factory life will not be injurious to the general health of the disabled man, the first sis months of training may be spent in a factory or workshop.6. The remaining two and a half years shall in all cases be spent in a factory or workshop.7. The first month of training both in the Technical School and in the factory or workshop shall be a trial period. In the case of Technical School Training, if at the end of the trial period the man, in the opinion of the Local Technical Advisory Committee, is considered unsuitable for the trade, his training shall cease. In the case of factory or workshop training, if at the end of the trial period the man is considered by the employer as unsuitable for the trade, his training shall cease, provided that he shall have the right to appeal to the Local Technical Advisory Committee (see below) for his training to he continued elsewhere. At the end of the trial period, if the man proves suitable for the trade, the employer shall agree, to retain him in his workshop until the end of the course of training, provided that if either party to the agreement desire for some substantial reason at any time to terminate the agreement, the case shall be referred for settlement to the Local Technical Advisory Committee who shall have power, after hearing evidence, to advise that the agreement be terminated.8. During the three years&apos; course of training the minimum rate of wages payable by the employer to the disabled man, and the maintenance allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee, shall be as stated in the following schedule :  
3SF0TE 2. In the case of a non-commissioned officer, the Local War Pensions Committee shall pay, during the first six months of training, such higher sums in accordance with his rank as may be appropriate to the highest degree of disablement, and during the remaining twelve months of training with maintenance such higher sum in accordance with his rank as will be laid down in a circular shortly to be issued.INote 3.-(a) In view of the fact that the disabled man, during the first 18 months, is in the position of an apprentice, the amount payable by the employer has been entered under &quot;wages (column i.), and not under the war advance (column ii.). It is to be observed that the amounts mentioned in column (i.) for the first 18 months are inclusive of all war advances granted by the Committee on Production for the period up to and inclusive of August 1st, 1917.(b) The War Advance payable to the disabled man during the &quot; Improvers Period &quot; shall be the War Advance applicable to the district in which lie is employed. The rate mentioned in column (ii.) of the above Schedule is that current in the London District as from 1st August, 1917, and should only be regarded as indicative of what the amount may be in other districts. Any subsequent increase or decrease- shall be added or deducted, as the case may be.(c) The wages in column (i.) are a flat rate for the country.9. In addition to the total weekly sum mentioned in Instruction 8 ^column iv above), a bonus of 5s. shall be paid by the Minister of Pensions for each week during the eighteen months of training under maintenance, but such bonus shall not be payable until the completion of the full course of three years&apos; training.10. At the conclusion of the full period of training the disabled man shall be regarded as a skdled workman in the trade, and the wages to be paid shall be the rate of wages applicable to the skilled workman in that trade in the district in which he is employed.11. Where in the case of factory or workshop training the employer pays to the disabled man a weekly sum in addition to the weekly wage mentioned in Instruction 8 (see column i.) as a bonus for increased efficiency, such bonus or weekly sum shall not be taken into consideration in calculating the amount of the Maintenance Allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee.Pi Lost time and overtime during the first eighteen months shall be computed on an hourly basis on the weekly wage payable by the employer, as laid down in column (i.) of the Schedule of Wages, and shall be in accordance with the customary pracdce of the workshop.Local Technical Advisory Oommittes.13. Where any training has been approved by the Minister of Pensions in the above mentioned trade and where the Minister of Labour on the advice of the Trade Advisory Committee (Ship-building and Engineering Trades) has set up for the area in which the training is to be given a Local Technical Advisory Committee, consisting of an equal number of representatives of associations of employers and of workpeople respectively, then provided such Committee is recognised by the Minister of Pensions after con-sultation with the Minister of Labour as representative of the trade in that area, the Local War Pensions Committee by whom the
training has been arranged shall consult the Local Technical Advisory Committee with regard to the following points : (a) The selection of candidates for training having regard totheir suitability for the trade.(b) The suitability of the training offered in the TechnicalSchools or similar institutes.(c) The suitability of the training offered in factories andworkshops, with special reference to the prospects of permanent employment, and(d) Any other questions arising out of the training of disabledmen for this trade.14. The Local Technical Advisory Committee shall inform the Local War Pensions Committee and the Trade Advisory Com-mittee (Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades) if at any time in their opinion a sufficient number of men have been trained, having regard to the number of men which the trade in the area -with which they are familiar could reasonably be &quot;expected to absorb.N.B. During the whole time that the man is undergoing training under maintenance his pension is withdrawn and he receives the full Maintenance Allowance (see page 9) from ihe Local War Pensions Committee in substitution for his pension. As soon as his period of training under main-tenance is finished the Maintenance Allowance will be withdrawn and the man will receive his pension again.Technical Schools.It is suggested by the Trade Advisory Committee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) that training centres be established in the following among other towns, as the demand arises : Birmingham, Brighton, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Halifax, London (Brixton, Regent Street Polytechnic, Northampton Institute, and Woolwich Polytechnic), Loughborough, Manchester, and Newcastle.Advisory Wages Board.Advisory Wages Boards are being established by the Minister of Labour to give advice as to the wages to be paid to disabled sailors and soldiers, having regard to the nature of their disability. Where, however, a Local Technical Advisory Committee has been set up for any industry in any area, it has been decided by the Minister of Labour that any dispute or difficulty with regard to the wages to be paid to disabled sailors and soldiers in that industry and area shall be referred to the Local Technical Advisory Committee, and not to the Advisory Wages Board. If the Local Technical Advisory Committee cannot arrive at a conclusion the matter shall be referred to the Trade Advisory Committee (Ship-building and Engineering Trades).It is to be noted that this provision will apply not only to men who are being or have been trained but also to any men who are being or who propose to be employed in that particular industry in the area in question.
Maintenance during Training.A disabled man, if eligible to be given training by his Local War Pensions Committee, may receive during his course of training an allowance as specified in Instruction 8 above, with an additional allowance for children at the rate of 5s. for the first child, 4s. 2d. for the second, 3s. M. for the third, and 2s. 6d. for each subsequent child, and if this training necessitates his living away from home and he is married, a further allowance of 13s. 9d. (more if he has been a non-commissioned officer) is given for his wife, together with the children&apos;s allowances at the rate mentioned above.In addition to these, any fees in respect of training will be paid by the Minister and an amount equal to 5s. for each week the training under maintenance lasted will be paid by the M inistry to tbe man at tbe end of the three years&apos; course of training, as a bonus for satisfactroy attendance.Applications for Disabled Men.Applications for or on behalf of individual disabled men wishing to. be trained or from employers wishing to train such men, should in the case of Scheme I. be addressed to the local Employment Exchange or to the Local War Pensions Committee, and, in the case of Scheme II., which is a scheme of training with maintenance, only to the nearest Local War Pensions Committee.Enquiries.Any questions upon which a Local War Pensions Committee may be in doubt should be referred by them to the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Millbank, S.W. 1.Any suggestions or enquiries other than those from the Local War Pensions Committee arising out of tbe technical matters dealt with in this Report should be addressed to the Trade Advisory Committee Branch (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) Employment Department, Ministry of Labour, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, Westminster, S.W. 1.

ORGANISATION BRANCHExtracts from Reports of Inspectors : for week endued 12th December, 1917.BLACKPOOL, jDQGAL POfoTCTCEEThe investigation of ca&amp;j-p&amp;pers showed good results. The homes ere regularly visited and the visitors !reports are of considerable value.   Recovery of Advances is satisfactory, SiofcneBO grants are, however, considerable and it is a question whether some of these have not been granted on insufficient grounds.   The grants are generally in order;   a few about which the Inspector w as not satisfied were specially pointed oui te the Local Committee^   In Blackpool there are many oases where rooms ere let in the summer and not in the winter and the Local Committee is granting rent allowances-when rooms are not let,NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. LOCAL COMMITTEE,This Committee^ keen interest and activity is maintained. Everything is highly satisfactory and the work is increasing greatly.   There are the neae3sary visitors available and if the Diatriot Committees act promptly the work connected with disabled men will now be dealt with within a short time of application.STAFFORDSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Inspector attended a meeting of the Committee which was very largely attended and good work was done.   A number of difficulties were smoothed out and matters are proceeding satisfactorily.WORCESTER LOCAL COMMITTEE.This is a.well managed Committee.   The Seoretary is very capable and en&amp;rgetic and is supported by a sufficient number of members to make the work run, smoothly.   The Regulations are ebsorvsd.The Committee are not satisfied regarding cases of chronic illness where there are wives with one or two young children. They assist these cases out of a local fund when they cannot give help under the Regulations.The method of keeping papers and records is unnecessarily complicated but the matter is being put right with the advice of the Inspector.GLOSS OP LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organisation is good.   Accounts are well kspt and clear;   all books in excellent order.   The Committee meet regularly and decide upon all applications.   The Ijisp-ector reports very favourably^on tbe-irork of tae,,Secretary to the Local Committee.
ASHT01MJ1PE&amp;-LYJE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Larger and more suitable accomodation is required for this Committee. -   The town is divided into Wards for purpose of investigation and visiting but the Ward Committees do not all act alike in authorising grants and allowances and the Inspector has suggested that they should be more under the supervision of the Local Committee.    The case-papers examined show a few irregularities, especially under the heading of &quot;Unspecified Emergencies&quot;.    Sickness grants are large and the maximum appears to be invariably granted.    The recovery of advances is not altogether satisfactory and the amount outstanding is on the increase.    This matter is, however, going to be carefully looked into.LIVERPOOL LOCAL COMITTEE.The alteration in the method of keeping aocounts which the Inspector suggested some time ago has been fully adopted and the accounts now show the payments classified under all the sub-heads.GRB1SBY LOCAL COMMITTEE.Organization good.    Accounting system clear and effeotive.    Advances and recoveries well kept.    The Committee and staff evidently endeavour to observe the Regulations,    Wives and dependants are helped by correspondence and in every possible way.    There are no voluntary visitors.     All persons are paid at the Town Hall.    The Inspector suggested that recipients should be paid at their own homes to avoid the inconvenience and unpleasantness of women having to wait at the Central Office for their money, but the suggestion was not approved.    The Committee stated that they had had voluntary workers and that the system had failed.    Generally speaking a good Committee,WIGTOWNSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE,The organization and administration of this Committee are fairly good and the books are carefully kept.    A number of case papers were examined and it was found that the Regulations were carefully adhered to.KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organization and administration of this Committee are fairly good except that their method of recording recoverable &quot; advances is bad.    The Treasurer and Clerk have been notified of a proper system of recording these advances and an improvement is to be expected.    Generally speaking the Regulations were care-fully adhered to,DUMFRIESSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The organization and administration of this Committee are good.    The books are carefully kept by the Acting Treasurer. The system of recovering advances could be improved and the Inspector discussed the matter with the Chairman and Treasurer. A number of oase-paper3 were examined and generally speaking it was found that the Regulations were carefully adhered to.
