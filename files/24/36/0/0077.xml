By the intervention of the Board an amicable solution was attained during the week in a question involving the.cleaning of a march ditch.     This question had long been a matter of contention, and had beon the subject of litigation in the Courts.1.   Inoreased Cultivation in 1918*The Board have requested Executive Committees to furnish reports showing the aroa of increased cultivation In 1918 for which arrangements have so far been completed and have impressed on then the necessity of securing still further increases in view of the fact that some of the Committees may not be able, owing to exception-:al local conditions, to secure the proportion of increased culti-:vation assigned to them.The Ayrshire Committee have completed the survey of their district and have submitted to the Board a list of approximately 400 farms where inoreased cropping is desirable and have recommended the Board to issue, if necessary, compulsory Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2t: requiring the desired additional cropping to be carried out in 1918.     The Board are glad tc report that after communicating directly with the farmers a number of them have up to the present signified their willingness to carry out the Committee&apos;s proposals.2* Seed Potatoes (Immune Varieties) Order 1917.Returns were obtained by the Board in September of the stocks of potatoes of the four varieties &quot;Great Scot&quot;, &quot;Xing George V&quot; &quot;Lochar&quot; and Templar&quot; covered by the above Order, which prohibited the removal or sale of potatoes of these varieties without a licence from the Board.     This Order was made with a view to controlling the distribution of these immune varietles^in order that adequate supplies should be made available for planting in districts in which Wart Disease has occurred.     Arrangements were made with the Food Production Department of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries whereby a total quantity of 7000 tons - 3000 tons &quot;Great Scot&quot;, 3000 tons &quot;King George V&quot; and 1000 tons &quot;Templar&quot; would be purchased by them for distribution in England and Wales, and a representative of that Department has now completed the purchase of this quantity. The Beard meantime withheld licences for the sale of the potatoes to other puronassrs outside of Scotland and they have impressed on Scottish Growers the necessity of obtaining their supplies without delay in order that any available surplus may be sold to merchants and growers in England and Wales.
