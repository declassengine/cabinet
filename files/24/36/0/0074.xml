war, gAsapiT.&apos;7.T. 3074^ J^C^URJir L ABO Oil?.Copy, cf letter from jar. J.F. IIo^e^ III-to Secretary., War Cabinet.(Circulated with reference to War-Cahinely&apos; a9?.., Minute 9)PRISONERS OF WAR DEPARTSMEHTDOWRIITG STREETS.W. 1.20th December,,1917.Dear Sir,With reference to the minutes of the War Cabinet of December 13th and to my statement that instructions given by the Prisoners of War Employment Committee forhad &quot;apparently not been carried out&quot;, I am informed by General 0&apos;Leary, that so far as he is concerned, he carried them out exactly and that returns of such prisoners were available from week to week.     I hasten to say that I entirely accept this statement and indeed never intended to impute any blame to General 0&apos;LearyAll that I meant to say was that if the statement that &quot;1,000 skilled ploughmen&quot; were still available was correct, our&apos;inslTructions must have^mis-ca^rried; and it now appears that the whole incident was due to micunder-s-tanding.     In justice to General CLeary, I hope that this explanation may have equal currency with my statement and may in particular &quot;&quot;be - comnunixated to Sir A.. Geddes and Sir Arthur ie-e as representing the&quot;Departments.. princApally concerned.the selection of agriculturists among German prisonersVery truly yours.(sd)    James F\ Hope .
