(This Document is the Property of       (jS3His Britannic iVfaj&apos;esty?s Government) /Liquor Restriction and Control.Memorandum by the Food Controller,On September 28th (War Cabinet 241, Minute 16) the War Cabinet considered a memorandum by me on the future supply of beer (Paper G ,T .5&amp;SbJ and sanctioned for the quarter October-December, the 53-ijr increase in the standard barrelage permitted for the current (Michaelmas) quarter.The industrial unrest, in so far as It was due to the . restricted output of beer, has been considerably allayed by this increased barrelage,. but reports which reach me from various parts of the country show that it would be unwise from a national point of view, to curtail the present output of beer in the quarter commencing on the 1st January.   I feel obliged therefore to recommend the War Cabinet to sanction the continuance of the present output of beer during the ensuing quarter.   An early decision is desirable t* enable the Order to be issued before the commence-I  ment of the period in question.RHONDDA.Ministry of Food,17th December, 1917.
