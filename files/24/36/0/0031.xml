In connection with the Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson on a Psychological Offensive (G.T.2941) and the accormo fury ing papers, I should like to express my very hearty agreement with the suggestion that the moment is peculiarly opportune for&apos; r&apos;femulating a counter-pian of campaign upon a big and world-wide scale&apos;1, and for the&apos; addressing of &quot;a statement from the Allies11, if possible, on the lines suspected to enemy peoples.At the same time, apart from the particular proposal in the Memorandum, I wish to raise for careful examination whether &apos;our propaganda, both in Allied and Enemy countries, Is as well supplied with men and means as it needs to be.     It is&quot; imn-os-clbl-e to deny that events have been in our favour Ir Russia for nearly three years, and yet it would appear that our popularity as an-Ally - and even as a nation - has progressively waned, rjhILsi the Germans, alt-hough guilty In the invaded districts of all manner of cruelties to Russian subjects, have contrived,- by thorough-going methods, to take advantage of the different aspects of internal conditions of Russia, whether under the Monarchy or under the Republic, and use them tc their own military advantage.,7:0 know, of course, that the direct cause of the Russian-down-fall has been the miserable inefficiency of their own Government and administration, but the Germans have- contrived to make use of conditions of Government even mutually mi to g. on1s tic, for their own purposes.-     It would seem also that in Italy toe their efforts have done much - not only to spread distrust- between the Allies, but to weaken the resistance of the Italian- fercesv;    in/&apos;
In Germany itself - more still in Austria amcl most of all in Turkey - there would&apos;&apos;appear to be abundant opportunity for yell advised and vigorously prosecuted propaganda In aid of the Allied Cause.      I am. not referring to our Intelligence Lervice, which appears to me to be of a singularly high and efficient hind, but       the organisation of propaganda in their o&apos;..n countries hostile to the Snennr Governments.     This kind of thing is repugnant tc the British spirit, but surely it is a weapon we ought to use to the uttermost In a struggle like this.      I do not know who Is responsible for this branch of our work or tc what extent our efforts have expanded, but? with every desire to be entirely fair to all concerned, I tliink the results apparent up to the present warrant a renewed exom-inatlon of this subject, with a vie.; to &quot;making good any defect in our machinery which may exist for the purposes indicated.C. Addison.17th December, 1917.
