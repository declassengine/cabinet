Minute 2,  and 225, Minute 8) wish to submit the following interim report and recommendations..1 -    SCOTTISH KATTONAL WAR MUSEUM, Mr, Munro reported that informal communications hadreached him from representative   Scotsmen - civil, militaryand naval - showing that strong- and even enthusiastic supportwould be forthcoming to the proposal to use Edinburgh-Castleas the Central Museum for Scottish Military History?   Thedesire for some such Museum-and Memorial is widespread throughout Scotland all parts of which would readily combine if theCastle were made ayailable for t he purp o s e.The Committee expressed genera]  approval of the scheme,on being assured that,  as the new Bedford Barracks are now completed,  the r/ar Office will not require the building after the war,  except to a very limited extent.   The Committee therefore invites the assent of the Cabinet to the proposal, subject to the following conditions:-(a) That the establishment of a Scottish National Historical War Museum and Memorial is in no sense intended to be antagonistic to the general interests or catholicity of the Imperial War Museum,  in which Scottish aspects of the war should be fully representedo(b) That the existing authority of the First Commissioner of Works in regard to the Castle as an Historical and Architectural monument of paramount importance,  should continue unimpaired throughout the period of its adaptation for museumpurposes
purposes.(c) That in the event of any request being made for agrant of public money, account should be taken of the factthat the site and buildings of the Castle represent a largemoney contribution towards the necessary outlay,     At thesame time, K.M. Office of Works might reasonably be calledupon to meet part of the expense involved in adapting thebuildings to their new purposes.Should the Cabinet concur in the foregoing purposes,it is suggested that the Secretary    for Scotland be authorisedto take such steps as he considers desirable for announcingthe decision of the Cabinet, for discussing the best methodsof enlisting Scottish interest and support, for collectingexhibits and relics and for formulating a general policy todeal with the Castle buildings5 in conjunction with the First.Commissioner of Works,2* THE HAME- 0? THE WAP.   MUSEUM. The Committee, having received form the India and Dominions Committee of the War Museum a resolution in favour of the word &quot;Imperial&quot; as opposed to the word &quot;National&quot;,  and having considered the scope and character of the Museum, it was decided to recommend to the War Cabinet that the title of the central War Museum in London should be the &quot;Imperial War Museum&quot;4(Sgd) Crawford &amp; Balcarres,14th December, 1917.
