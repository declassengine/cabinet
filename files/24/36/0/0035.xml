JiA. CORCORAN.(i0Copy of letter No, 0155/2847 (0.1.) dated 13th December 1917 fromSecretary. War Office, to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. ,Sir,With reference to the attached copy of a &quot;Memorandum cf Arrangement between the British and United States Governments on the Training and Supply of Personnel for Air Forces of &quot;both Countries&quot;;  together with a copy of a cable despatched to the United States Government by the American Military Authorities in Paris, I am commanded by the Army Council tc request that you will instruct the British Ambassador at Washington to continue the negotiation of this matter officially with the Government of the UnitedS &quot;fc 3* o   3 o
w 2 -2,1 am to point out that tho lav/ officers of ths Crownhsvo expressed the opinion thot formeu bodies of American (or Allied) Troops in this Country are, by the doctrine of ex-territoriality, subject to their own codes of Military Law whilst in their own camps or quarters in this country, hut that individual American (or Allied) soldiers outside their camps are subject only to the- ordinary laws of this Country, and cannot therefore be&apos;&apos;&apos;arrested, either by their own or British authorities, civil or military, for purely military offences such ?s desertion, etc.It is, however, proposed to remedy this by Defence of the Realm Regulations, hut a reply is awaited from the American authorities before taking any action,30 I am therefore to state that should the U.S.Government agree to this proposal, these mechanics should he:-(1) Properly enlisted soldiers;( ) Despatched in formed bodies under their ownofficers, and (3) Self contained in every sense for discipline.On arrival in this Country they would Be kept together as units, end their officers would therefore have plenary powers to punish according to American Law.I am to say that the Army Council are of opinion that these points should bo brought out clearly, es otherwise there may be considerable misund rstanding es regards the proposal.A memorandum is forwarded herewith, which sets out in detail the subdivision of an Aircraft Repair Depot, and the trades in v;hich mechanics should be qualified.4o In conclusion I am to emphasize the fact that British mechanics, released by the supply of American mechanics, will be employed ir completing the establishment of other R^JX-,-, units,  thus releasing personnel for the .-.rmies in the Field. Un no account will the British mechanics.thus released he utilised to work in factories und-^r civilian conditions with civilian paysI am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)     H.. K0 BRADS,i inii)Memorandum of arrangement between the British and United StatesGovernments,The result of three years1 experience and figures based on establishments to the end of the sanctioned R.FaCc programme to the end of July 1919 proves conclusively that the number Other Ranks personnel required to maintain each active sere-plane on any Front is 47., 5 men divided proportionately in So trade categories in accordance, with Establishments.. The sanctioned and proposed RoFoC. programme to July 1919 provided for 240 service squadrons to be available in various theatres of operations.     The supply of machines for t\
first 200 service squadrons is already arranged for in Great Britain.   The supply of the &quot;balance of the machines to the 240Squadrons will he arranged for in the agreement come to at the present Conference sitting in Paris.   The position as to the personnel for the above mentioned R.F.C. programme of 240 Squadrons is not, however,  as satisfactory.   There is great need for men in Great Britain for all tranches of the Servicesand the supply of technical personnel is practically exhausted. Consequently the mechanics required for these additional Squadrons can only he obtained by depleting Infantry Units of men who are not actually qualified-and will require a large amount of training.   This in the present state of man-power available is manifestly impossible., -The position with regard to personnel in the United States to man the proposed Squadron is, I understand,  exactly the converse of the position in Great Britain^  there being a plentiful supply of man-power even with technical qualifications hut not sufficient facilities for training rapidly, and in all these connections it should he borne in mind that time is the paramount factor.In view of the foregoing a reciprocal and mutually advantageous proposal is set out hereunder,, namely,  that to assist in the training of American personnel and to provide mechanics for training Squadrons so that already trained person-nel may be released for Biitish service Squadron in the Field, 15,000 American mechanics should he temporarily drafted for training to British training Units in Great Britain,  the methoo. of procedure to be as follows.   Within one month of date, approximately 4,000 Americans to he despatched to this country in accordance with the establishment of Southern Aircraft Repair Depots, particulars of which trades have been forwarded to the United States,   V/ithin two months of date 5,000 mechanics to he forwarded and within.three months of date the balance.of the 15,000*    The method to he adopted with these mechanics will he as follows:On arrival in the United Kingdom they will be drafted into existing training Units of the R.F.C. releasing an equal number of trained.B,F.C. personnel for R.F    . service Squadrons. Their training would be undertaken on exactly the same lines as is adopted with the R.F,C. and as, from time to time, their training is completed, &quot;batches of these American mechanics shall be released for posting to American Units formed,  or forming,  in France,  their places in the&apos;fLF,C. Units at home being taken by an equal number of untrained American mechanics from the United States.As it is manifestly impossible for a Service Squadron, either British or American to he efficiently maintained in the Field unless the other Ranks are sufficiently trained it is of paramount importance that the dates of release of the American personnel shall be decided by the R.F.C. who are undertaking the training.    It must be further agreed that when these releases to American Units take place the untrained men replacing the trained shall arrive in Great Britain 14 days before the release of the trained men.
f - If, as tho rc-sult of the pra&amp;cnt Conference, it is decided .&apos;v as Likely that a large number of machines will he sent over from the United States in smell parts for assembly and erection in tne United Kingdom, it v/ill he necessary to again or.ll upon the . United Steves for additional personnel for erection purposes. Under those conditions the above mentioned scheme for training American personnel ccn be extended on the seme basis, with this exception&apos;that the personnel for -the erection Units will not be roloasablc for service in the Field as the rrpid erection and delivery of machines is mainly dependent upon a Complete training ana vory efficient orgcjdsctaonj the details as to dotes and numbers to be decidoa when definite datcs^crn be given for the delivery of the American machines to Ihiropc;This erection in Europe can only he undertaken satisfactorily if the date for the delivery of machines from America with the numbers by dates arc decided at once,&apos; as it will be necessary to provide additional buildings end aerodromes for erection and delivory of those American machines,labour.With reference to tho British programme of 240 squadrons rnontionod above further assistance is required from tho United Statos to a vory small extenta    Tho supply of labour for preparing c-orodromcs and erecting buildings in the United Kingdom is very far short of tho various ^requirements,&apos; and to ensuro tho completion of tho British programme to date, it is essential that certain assistance bo given to tho Br.Hish Government in this rcspoat.    It is asked, therefore, that the following Morican labour may be despatched to this country without delay1,200 Bricklayers. 1,000 Carpenters, and 4,000 General Labourers,,In view of tho rates of pay obtainable in Great Britain difforing from those in tho United States it is essential that this labour, which will be paid at Moricon rates is military labour and tho men ore in uniform-,     in this connection arrangements con be mado to give those men military training concurrently with their actual work, so that when tho work i-n tho aorodromos is completed they will be available for draft-ing into American Units in Franco, having to complete&apos; their training before taking their place in the lino0With regard to erection of American machines in the United Kingdom mentioned rJoove, labour will also bo required for aerodromes for those, but here again, numbers end trades can-not bo decided until definite dates of the arrival of these unorcctcd machines-arc given.    Directly this information is available the figures will he produced of trades by dates?
