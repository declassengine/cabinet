siment Is the Propertyecret emberFrom Viceroy, Foreign DepMfaiMtytWPffiMM?11&apos; ^ Govei (Repeated to TelwrmTau^ (Received at India Office, 11.50 p.m.)Persia.   Reference to Marling&apos;s telegram 4-17 P., dated l?tlidemocratic revolution at Teheran is imminent, would it not be advisable even at this eleventh hour to try to win over leading democrats including even Mukktar-es-Sultana and Bakhtiaris, who will in that event be &apos; two real forces who count ? Conciliation of one would not appear to exclude conciliation of the other. By securing goodwill and confidence of democrats we should put ourselves into a position to guide revolution, instead of being ,main object of its detestation.Bakhtiaris could doubtless,be won over by removal&apos;from (Ispahan ?) of Zil family, who could be otherwise compensated, appointment of Bakhtiari Governor, and generous support of Bakhtiari forces.Apparent urgency&apos;of situation must be excuse&apos;for our importunity, in again advocating change of policy.
