a: *PSECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BAX7/022.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary.   XXII* (14th December, 1917.)Events have moved fast during the last few weeks and already in the public mind in Austria the Italian campaign is obscured by developments on the Russian front, while the second place of interest is taken by the ever-growing anxieties of the economic situation and by the friction between Austria and Hungary, which has outgrown the old stage of mutual bickering and threatens the constitutional foundations of the State.Peace Proposals.    Austria-Hungary received the first news of the Bolsheviks1 intention to make overtures through a Reuter wire from London.    The official press, obviously acting on a mot dtordrei at once treated Lenin as beyond question the only Russian politician qualified to speak in the name of the Russian masses1.    On the 23rd Hovember Dr. Wekerle announced in the Hungarian Parliament that the offer would be most sympathetically considered: this was six days before Count Hertling proclaimed Germanyfs readiness to discuss.    Even more remarkable was the speech of Count Tisza which elicited Sr. Wekerle&apos;s statement.    He emphasised the faot that the Central Powers are in a position to await developments in Russia (this is of course the oue of the entire press, which argues that Russia must make peace, whereas Germany and Austria can go on indefinitely), but do not desire to prolong the war one moment after the Monarchy^ existence has been assured.    He reminded the House that after the Jtttrzsteg Argument (i.e. when Russia and Austria-Hungary reached a direct agreement on Macedonia in 19G3) he had himself declared with
great emphasis that no necessary antagonism existed between Hungary and Russia if only Russia renounced her aggressive policy of conquest.    He reaffirmed&apos;this word for word, and recommended accepting the proferred hand, without making any formalist objections.    The main interest of the Russian people, he argued, was now to free itself from the burden of war and from subjection to its allies.Such an attitude on the part of the most reactionary states-men of Central Europe deserves special emphasis.     It is quite certain that Tisza is now acting by arrangement with Count Czernin, who conferred with him during his last visit to Budapest.     Despite the usual proud phrases, such a bid on the part of such a man for the friendship of such a government as that of the Bolsheviks may fairly be regarded as the measure of the desire for peace in Austria-Hungary.    Moreover the extreme readiness of the Ballplatz to negotiate with a body of extreme revolutionists, if only they could prove their authority, undoubtedly represents either a change of mentality or a degree of anxiety which is very remark-able indeed.The dominant line of argument in the press appears to be that a death-blow haa been dealt to war the moment the three great Powers of Eastern Europe decide in favour of peace.     The semi-official Pester Lloyd in this connection deals with Lord Lansdowne!s letter as a proof of readiness on the part of serious statesmen to reckon with facts - &quot;facts&quot; meaning the victory of the Central Powers.The Czech, Southern Slav and Ukrainian deputies in the Reichsrat have issued a public protest with regard to the suppression of a passage in the Russian Governments peace pro-posal, in which the right of self-determination is laid down as one of the bases of negotiations.     They then prodeed to make their own government responsible, should negotiations break
dov/n, and to reaffirm the doctrine of self-determination, in accordance with their pronouncements in Parliament on the 30th May last.Since then the Austrian Premier, the Joint foreign Minister and two such prominent members of the Hungarian Delegation as Counts Andrassy and Tisza; appear to have publicly repudiated the doctrine of self-determination as being wholly inapplicable to Austria-Hungary.    Ab* however, the reports of the Delegation debates in the British press are very incomplete and inadequate, and as there has been an unusually long delay in receiving the Austrian ahd Hungarian press, it seems v/iser to defer comment on these very important expressions of policy until a later report.The Commercial Ausgleich.    Meanwhile the commercial Corn-promise - the arrangement renewable for ten years between Austria and Hungary and due to expire at the end of 1917 - has been renewed for a period of two years only.    This represents, if not an actual change of policy, at any rate a determination to avoid lengthy commitments on all sides.    As the result of long and detailed negotiations between Budapest and Vienna, Count Tisza&apos;s late Government had reached virtual agreement as to a new commercial arrangement for twenty years between the two oountriee: and this was due largely to pressure fi^om Berlin, where it was held that a long-term arrangement between Austria and Hungary must precede any closer commercial arrangement between the two partners and Germany.    Wekerle, it is true, has always been regarded as more or less &quot;Central European&quot; in his economic ideas: but inBide his own Cabinet the Independence party is in a majority, and it is openly opposed to any arrangement whioh might hamper Hungaryfs entire freedom of commercial action in the critical years following the war.     It is an open secret that Hungary asked too high a price for the tv/enty years&apos; arrangement - and in particular the lowering of Hungary&apos;s Quota or contribution to the joint
expenses of the Dual Monarchy.    The view generally held in Austria is that the hugs profits made by the agrarians and industrialists of Hungary render such a.claim altogether unjustifiable.We are certainly not justified in treating the substitution of a two year1 for a twenty year1 arrangement as a rebuff to Germany: for all the time elaborate negotiations are proceeding between the leading bankers, industrialists and commercial men of Berlin, Vienna and Budapest.     But it is undoubtedly a step back from the path of Central European union, so ably advocated by Friedrich Naumann and other political writers.    It is a sign that Austria and Hungary * both only too conscious of their economic vassalage to Germany - are endeavouring so far as possible to keep their hands free.The new arrangement brings in it-a train the renewal for the same period of Austria-Hungary&apos;s various commercial treaties with friendly and neutral States.Slav Claims against Hungary.   Hungary1 s relative economic prosperity as compared with Austria, the vehement charges of food hoarding levelled at the Magyars from Vienna and the various ^ attempts to extract food supplies by hodling up the import of coal, paper etc from Austria into Hungary, have undoubtedly played their part in rendering a long-term agreement more difficult.     But apart from this there is most acute political friction, as the result of the reiterated Slav claims for unity with their oppressed kinsmen in Hungary.    The attacks upon Hungary by Mr. Stanek, President of the Czech Parliamentary Club, and other Slav deputies during the Polish debate of 9th Hovember, have on several occasions since given rise to lively debates and protests in the Hungarian Parliament.    Baron Perenyi. a follower of Tisza, denounced the Czech attacks as &quot;impertinent and criminal&quot; and described the Czechs as mere &quot;burglars&quot; who tried to rob Hungary of her property
while engaged in a struggle with highwaymen.    He complained with extreme violence of the Czecho-Slovak movement organised by Professor Masaryk abroad, assumed that this would supply Mr. Lloyd George with material for one of his most eloquent speeches, criticised the Austrian Government for its silence in the face of such attacks, and ended with a warning that if persisted in, they might produce a movement in Hungary for complete separation.    The ex-Minister of Justice Polonyi spoke in favour of an independent Hungarian Army, as the sole means of ending such intrigues, and Count Andrassy made a long, speech, pitched in a high key and claiming that the war had proved Hungary to be the surest bulwark of the Dual Monarchy and the Czechs to be a grave danger to state and dynasty alike.The Premier, in reply, assured the House that the sharpest measures would be taken to prevent Czech agitation among the Slovaks, and openly associated himself with the criticism directed against the Austrian Premier and the President of the fteichsrat. He stated that he had submitted an elaborate Memorandum to the Crown, declaring that such acts make Hungary1s co-operation with Austria difficult.     &quot;As it is also our (Hungary1s) affair,&quot; he added, &quot;whether Austria is organised on a dualist or a federal basis, I went so far as to declare fthat unless the ground was cut from under the feet of these intrigues, the process of dissolution must begin.&quot;In conclusion Dr. V/ekerle announced that he had the (Emperor-) King18 permission to state that the Crown would not fail to Use all its authority against &quot;tendencies hostile to the independence or territorial integrity of the Hungarian State&quot;.This official dragging of the Crown,into the quarrel was at once taken up by the Austrian Slavs, who interpellated the Austrian Premier, and elicited from him a statement which is probably equally unsatisfactory to all parties.     He condemned,: but in a
somewhat perfunctory way, all onslaughts on the existing con-atitutional framework of the Dual Monarchy, and then devoted him-self to the problem of internal Austrian reform.    Ee based the policy of his Government on the unity of the Austrian State and the absolute maintenance of the existing frontiers of the seventeen Austrian provinces.     He assured Hungary that Austria was planning nothing which could infringe the inviolability of Hungary or injure the foundations of Dualism.Thus whatever may be in contemplation behind the scenes, all the competent authorities of the Dual Monarchy - the Crown, the Joint Foreign Minister and the two Governments, have reaffirmed more explicitly than ever their approval of the existing order, and their repudiation of the national claims of all save ihe Poles. It is difficult to talk seriously of a movement for Federalism in any quarters that count.Changes at Court.    Prom reliable private sources it is learned - and this fully confirms the general impression - that theivictory in Italy took Vienna itself completely by surprise.    There appears to have&quot; been a considerable change of feeling in Hungary since the victory: the ruling class especially making no conceal-ment of its admiration for the Germans.    Count CzerninS position has been strengthened by the belief that his influence played its part in the /reform movement in Germany and the advent ttf Count Hertling-^to power.    This is highly probable ift view of&apos;the known intimacy between the Courts of Vienna end Munich.    The fact however that Czernin is now openly backed by Count Tieza Is certainly a proof of our Informant4s contention regarding Czernin*s &quot;strengthened position: buvs^it in also an indication &apos;that Czemin is moving in a retrograde direction, and his most recent utteranoes are a strong confirmation of that fact.Our informant learns that the Emperor Charles is greatly incensed at the attitude of the Czechs, on whom the amnesty and
repeated overtures of the Seidler Government have remained without effect.     He regards anti-Slav&quot;tendencies as on the increase in Vienna and treats the retirement (which he regards as a dismissal) of Count PoXzer-Hoditz as an anti-Slav event.    Polzer-Hoditz had been Director of the Private Cabinet of the Emperor: he is quite a young man, enjoyed the personal intimacy of the Emperor and only two months ago was made a count - a very rare and signal honour in Austria.     Though rumour credits him with having instigated the amnesty for the Slav deputies, it would be as much a mistake in his case as in that of Czernin and Clam-Martinic to treat him as Slav in sentiment.     He belongs to the &quot;Old Austrian&quot; bureaucracy, whose tradition is essentially a-national and Habsburg, and acts on the motto of &quot;Patriots for Me&quot;.     It is not even quite certain that he is in dsigrace: for there is talk, possibly quite fantastic, of his being reserved for the task of forming a new political govern-ment, to supersede the colourless Seidler Cabinet.     In this connection it is worth mentioning that the leading German Radical newspaper in Prague has quite recently alluded to the persistence of rumours that a complete change of system in Austria is con-templated.     Certainly voices are heard from time to time reminding Seidler that he has twice announced constitutional reform but done nothing to carry it out, while Prussia and even Hungary are embarking upon it.The Polzer incident deserves special emphasis, as a further illustration of the purely personal and arbitrary methods of selection for political office which prevail behind the screen of a nominal constitutional regime.    There is absolutely nothing to prevent the Crown from replacing Count Czernin to-morrow by some obscure personal friend of whom the two Parliaments know nothing, and this applies in a lesser degree to the two Premierships also.
1 QJL*JTHE   ECONOMIC   CRISIS.Every day brings fresh confirmation of the gravity of the economic situation in Austria.     On&apos;the 21st Ifovemljer the Vienna Town Council issued a public warning to the population, to the effect that there was a grave danger of bread shortage in the near future and added that it would hold the Government responsible for such a situation if it arose.    This elicited a soothing statement from the Pood Control Office, which declared that the situation was far worse last spring.     In order to prove this, it makes the highly significant admission: &quot;We then hardly had the necessary supplies of corn and meal for two to three days.&quot;    This is nc doubt past history, but it throws a flood of light upon the situation; for it is obvious and indeed generally admitted that food conditions are infinitely v/orse now than they were then.    Even the ileue Preie Presse itself in a lengthy article entitled &quot;Lack of Bread and Meal&quot; roundly declares that &quot;Vienna has now been living for almost two years from hand to mouth, and that there must obviously be something wrong with the Pood Controller&apos;s plans, in view of the fact that &quot;already in November, four months after the new harvest, there are difficulties which are not entirely due to the transport crisis&quot;.The socialist Arbeiter Zeitung is even more outspoken, and alludes to &quot;difficulties under which the whole economic system is threatening to collapse&quot;.    The crisis,, it argues, is no longer a question of distribution, but one of production - the altogether excessive prices allowed to farmers and agrarian proprietors having inevitably led to a decline of effort and therefore   a deoreased output.     It also gives great prominence to the other main.cause of trouble, &quot;the intolerable confusion of transport conditions&quot;. ,!Efe know from the March Says of Russia the connection between&quot; transport difficulties and popular suffering: and these troubles &quot;must assume indefinite proportions unless ploughing and sowing
m    ^    mare carried through in good time.&quot;    This hint at a possible administrative break-down in Austria is very significant.Certainly transport is the most serious internal problem of to-day in Austria.     As an example of what is happening throughout the country we cannot do better than quote the complaint of the leading German paper in Prague, which stated that Bohemia solely for the distribution of grain within her own boundaries requires 876 trucks per week, but that in the last week of October there were only 573 trucks and in the first Week of ilovember only 504. In other words, one-third of the requirements of a province, which is relatively better off than any other in Austria, could not be met.     If then it is necessary even in November to draw on such reserves of grain as there are, what is to happen in spring and summer of next year?    The same paper points out in the middle of November that there are no reserves of potatoes anywhere, and that by. the end of the month transport would become well-nigh impossible owing to frosts.     ITrom speeohes in the Reichsrat it is known that the German districts of northern Bohemia are already suffering from famine and shortage of such necessary crops u$ potatoes.Meanwhile the coal problem has become a public danger.    The High Command had stripped the mines bare of workmen, and though many miners were drafted back last summer from the army, it is admitted on all sides thj.t this was dene too late.    This has fatally affected distribution - especially as the workmen owing to bad food are not able to put in as much work as formerly.   Bven two months ago it was reported that five Bohemian towns had to give up their electric ligKc for lack of fuel.    Now the whole of Graz, the capital of Styria, an important university and industrial town of 150,000 inhabitants, lying on the main line from Vienna to the Adriatic,has been plunged into darkness for the same reason; while Budapest also has been reduced to the same
plight, ov/ing to inferior coal cho3cLng the retorts of the gas works.    There arc similar difficulties in Cracow.Speeches in Parliament refer to the prevalence of hunger-dropsy in German Bohemia, as the result of bad nourishment.    There have also been epidemics of emphysema from the same cause.     The Zeit i in lamenting the terrible spread of skin diseases - abscesses carbuncles, etc - sets it down to the shortage of fats, bread, sugar and milk, and the almost complete lack of vegetables and eggs.    Prominent Viennese doctors speak openly in the press of the dangers which threaten the population, and state that &quot;in the schools there are general complaints that the children cannot meet the requirements imposed upon them&quot; owing to privations.     The lack of milk, whioh specially affects the children, is shown by the official statement that its supply has fallen in Vienna itself from 900,000 to less than 200,000 litres per week.There have also been serious complaints in Parliament regard-ing the lack of tobacco, saccharine, matches and salt.   In the Budget Committee the Government representative admitted that there was 30 per cent lees tobacco available for civil consumption in 1917 than* in 1913.     It is also announced that the lack of fodder has rendered a further reduction of stock inevitable during the winter, and attempts are being made, by cold storage arrangements, tp use this fact to ease the situation.The general gloom has been heightened by the alarmist state-ments of the Mayor and the Pood Controller at a conference for the disoussion of the food problem last week.    The latter reported  -that the import of flour from Roumania would be considerably reduced, and that Germany, owing to her own situation, could not supply food-stuffs to Austria.14.12.17.
