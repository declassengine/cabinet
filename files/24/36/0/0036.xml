BORINGS FOR 0UAL tflU.; iw IRELAND.-:-M.v133/7MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION.&quot;1*       I have been furnished with various memoranda prepared by the engineers and - geologists working under&apos;&apos;the direction of Sir &apos;: Lionel Phillips in the Department for Development of Mineral Resources of the Ministry of Munitions, which I established earlier in the year.2.&apos;      Particular proposals have been passed- on to me by Mr.-Churchill on account of their involving possibilities which.,, in consequence of tho time necessary for their development, may   o possibly be classed as serving &quot;post-war&quot; rather than &quot;war:! purposesCertain of the proposals to which the technical memoranda specially refer, raise questions involving political, as well as economic considerations on which I desire to receive the directions of the Bar Cabinet.5.       There appears to be some ground for believing that considerable coal deposits may be found in the Lough ileagh Basin in Ireland, and it is suggested that an experimental boring might be made about the north-east corner of the Lough.4.       The papers also mention as a possibility that potash salts might also be found in the over-&apos;,lying strata. If this were so,  it would, of course, constitute, a discovery of vast national importance, but the geological considerations involved do not appear to warrant me in doing more than mention it as being a possibility. Putting this on one side, however, the discovery of an extensive Goal deposit in that part of Ireland would be of great importance from the economic and political point of view. It is estimated that a trial boring would cost about  7,500, and Sir Lionel Phillips&apos; organisation is ready and competent to undertake the work, if it were. decided jupon..
-2-5.       Sir Lionel Phillips is also prepared to undertake negotiations in advance with the neighbouring land-owners, with a view to protecting the national interest, in the event of success being obtained..6*       In view of the political and economic considerations involved, I would suggest that I should be authorised, after suitable preparations have been made, tc expend a sum not exceeding  15,000 in net more than two borings, if I am advised to make more than one by the technic-al. experus. of --Sir Lionel. Phillips&apos; Department,w e iri-i^ ^ jLk^ Wit .December, 19.17.
