^WaTED TO THE KTNH- ftftf) WAR CABINET;I circulate herewith Memorandum prepared in answer to an enquiry by Lord GurzonrTrie events of the past year in Abyssinia have failed altogether to justify the hope that-the-deposi-tion of the Turcophile Li3 Yasu would result in the .re-establishment of central control in ths countryrThe new. Regent, Ras Taffari, though personally very well disposed towardstthe Allied Powers, has hitherto proved unable either to suppress anarchy in the provinces or to cope with the German-inspired op** position of the; Empress and the Council of Ministers at Adis Ababa..    He has admitted to Mr.. Thesiger that a British protectorate over Abyssinia appears to him the only means of restoring order and good Governmentr This state of affairs, rendered worse by the avowed ef-forts of the Italian Government to hinder the formation of a strong Abyssinian Government, has led Air,. Thesiger to the conclusion that a &quot;break-up&quot; of the country is to be... looked for in the near future r.In the.meantime it has become increasingly obvious that the. provisions of the Tripartite Agreement are not workable in practice. It is in particular very diffi--cult to reconcile, the. conflicting claims of Italy and(Signed)Robert Cecilr
this countryr    Our paramount interest is to secure full control of the waters of Lake Tsana and the &quot;basin of the Blue Nile generally for purposes of irrigation in Egypt,    This is recognized in the Agreement, hut the same Agreement also assigns most of the Blue Nile basin to the Italian reversionary sphere-.    Attempts havs been mado for -some years past to com,: to som.3 sort of working agreement with the Italian Government, but without successr    The Egyptian authorities hold that it is impossible to exercise proper control over the waters without also controlling the territories through which they flowr   &apos;  he Italians on the other hand hold that our rights are purely &quot;hydraulic&quot;,. All our Representatives in Abyssinia and at Cairo, from the time of Lord Kitchener onwards, are agreed that the best solution lies in the consolidation cf our territories in the north and cf the Italian in-terests in the south.    They are als; agreed that it is indispensable tw put a stop tc the arms traffic from. French Scmaliland,In these circumstances Mr, Thesiger has, in his despatch ft c, QO of October 11th.. formulated a pro-posal for the solution of the Abyssinian question (which he describes as an alternative to the various former proposals which have lately been under discus-sion,)Mr, Thesiger&apos;s proposal is that Italy should cede Eritrea to Great Britain in return for British Somali-land, French Somaliland and the Kerehan country (inBritish
British East Africa) and for the right to declare a Protectorate over all Abyssinia*    Italy-.,&apos; at the same time, to guarantee to the Sudan all rights over the waters of Lake Tsana and the eventual, reversion of the four&apos;provinces of&apos;&quot;Abyssfnia&apos; bordering on the Sudan,. Gib j jam, Walega, Jlmma and&apos; Kaffa,     Italy would then assume all responsibility for the govern-ment of Abyssinia..The special advantages claimed for this solution are. (l) that it involves only two instead of three of the Great Powers and is correspondingly simple; (2) that a Protectorate over Abyssinia by a single Power (viz:   Italy) as suggested offers the only hope of internal reorganisation and the only escape from the- partition of the country which would other-wise shortly become inevitable;   (3)   that it pro^ vides -an ideal hinterland for the Sudan and assures the carrying out of the Lake Tsana scheme;&apos; (4)   that it gives Great Britain absolute supremacy in.the Red Sea and practical control of the Arabian Coast and (5) that it furnishes the compensation which Italy is expected to claim in Africa after the war,Mr. Thesiger visited Cairo at the beginning of December and discussed the proposal personally with Sir PV Wingate,. who has expressed his concurrence-: therein.In reply to a request for the views of His Majesty^ Government,. Sir RP Wingate was informed onDecember
December 15th, that the various proposals for terri-torial readjustment in Africa are being considered by the Interdepartmental Committee, but that the main difficulty which presents itself in respect to Mr, Thesiger 1ks: latest suggestion is that the Admiralty are unwilling to part with Berbera and the oil deposits in British Somalilandr    It was added that the Committee are enquiring as to the possibility of finding com-pensation for Italy elsewhere and that no decision had yet been reached?(Initialled)      tCr
