hZQbh Dec. 1917.8l. &apos;?0&amp;ti\$2h        2ho French Government have agreed that H.I&apos;.. Oovc.-ment anu the American Government shall he responsible for al negotiations at 1&apos;ontovideo respecting the enemy ships intern in Uruguayan ports.There are 60 enemy vessels lying in Spanish waters The Spanish Government have authorised tv;o Spanish subject a to charter tfieis from tho owe re,- on condition that they trade under the Spanish  leg and &apos;6e not trade with British Possess-ions.   It ie UBderstoofi that, if this arrangement takes effecti the Italian Government, will obtain the use of the vessels.   But an American syndicate are competing for the charters, and   still hope to secure them.The American proposals for a shipping agreement with Denmark involve(a)&apos; The allocation of 350,000 tone deadweight to Danish overseas trade.(b) The allocation of 200,000 tons deMweight tothe United States, and(c) The division of the surplus between Great Britainand the United States.A satisfactory principle for   the   division of the surplus has still to be arranged.      wo are pressing for a quota of not less then 20^,000 tons, this hiring the quantity of tonnage which the Danes are bound, by their shipping agreement with us, to main-tain in the Anglo-French coal trade.l&apos;e are urging the Unites States to find immediately 600,000 tons for ,the use of France anfi Italy;   and we think that eventually .the United States should find 1,750,000 tons. We ourselves are already providing our Allies with 3,000,000CVe - %11
tons, and.are endeavour Ing to find them a further 750.000 to But, in the matter of tank-steamers, we ourselves need Americ helps     if it is not forthcoming we shall have to face the reduction of our-oil imports oy 100,000 tons a month, owing to the sacrifices of tonnage which we are making to provide our Allies with necessary supplies ox grain.We are asking tho Unite a States to tinker take a ship-huilcling programme of at least 9,000,000 tons deadweight per annum.    It 1b only by do ing so, anfi &quot;by reducing their domestic*requirements of tonnage to the lowest possible figure, that they can   save the situation for the Allies,*        llight work has boon discontinued in the densan munition factories.     The reason officially given its that largo reser-ves of munitions have been accumulated;    but It is alleged on good authority that there is a shortage of essential raw materials.From the $erman press- we gather that the first&apos; estimates of the potato crop have boon severely reclueeel on reeonsic; era-$ion. 2he grain crops have also proved ci is appoint Ing;   andthe&apos; number of pigs in the Empire turns out to he far smaller than the Government supposed.It has been found necessary to place at the disposal ofBohemia that part of the Houmaniaa harvest which was intended for Germany..a H.15. Government have practically suspended all shipments,whether of military stores or of other goods, from the British Empire to. Russia.       Goods on their way jto Vladivostok;, which hove been purehosea In tho United Steles out of British credits, ere to be unloaded in Japan.      Wdfrare urging the Allied Crovernmente to take similar steps.S*       &apos; It is announced in the Swedish Brass . that important agr bents have boon raade by the Swedish ami Danish Governments for
the exchange of goocts between Sweden and Denmark.     One oonse-quenoe of these agreements will he an increased exportation to Sweden of Danish agricultural produce. .   Whether this will he to our advantage is doubtful.     The Danes are asking us to pay an exorbitant price for their, batter;   ana a refusal on our part to be fleeced may result in the diversion of our quota of Danish agricultural produce to Sweden.    The Germans apparently submit to pay Danish prices and are therefore assured of obtain ing their quota.   Our only card is coal.   We might threaten either to cease supplying Denmark with coal, or to rates the price of our coal, unless we aro supplied with Danish produce at reasonable prices.      But, before we play this card, it is advisable to ascertain how far the new Banish arrangements with&apos; Germany are likely to increase the present exports of German coal to Denmark.     She Danes are supplying the German railways with 800 trucks for this cei3l traffic, ana   already 1,000 Danes are hawing coal for Denmark in the German mines.Germany is supplying Denmark with 100 tone of benzine a month, and hope? to raise the supply to EGO tons.   Austria-Hungary is offering 1,500 tons of benzine for sale in Oopen-hagen.   But the price demanded by the Central Empires is higher than the maximum price fixed by the official Benzine Committee, ana no buyers have yet been forthcoming for tho Austro-Ihingarian supply.     Evidently tho Danish Government would prefer to obtain American motor spirit at a comparatively reasonable figure.1*      The Swedes have received over*4,000 tons of German potatoes since the beginning of December;   and on Dec.8. gole to the value of 8,450,000 kr. arrived at Falmo from Germany fo? the account of the Swedish State Bank.     Gold and food are the commodities which Germany can least afford to surrender
ki 5 4at the present time. It may he inferred that she attaches supreme importance to the minerals, the alloys ana the iron ana steel goods which she is receiving from Sweden.Sg, johv^yo She terms of the Korwegisn Agreement with the U.S.A.are still under discussion.   2he Norwegian conntor-proposals appear to leave a number of loop-holes for trade with the enemy, and H.M. Government are endeavouring to explain to the State Department the importance and the   difficulty of arrang-ing a water-tight agreement.    According to Sir K. Findiay the Norwegian Prime Minister is exasperated by the delays which have occurred in the negotiations at Washington, and will pro-fcahly he supported by the Storting If he rejects the American demands.     On the other hand, the shortage of food and of other essential supplies in.Norway is much more acute than the Norwegian Government admit,r/* IBS.JSMlSllj:   It would appear that sand and gravel of German origin are still passing over the 3)utch waterways to Belgium and lorthem France.   The quantities are greatly reduced, hut they are still appreciable.      Cargoes amounting to 58,000 tons Of Band, 48,000 tons of gravel and 3,700 tons of f^int have been reported as passing via Hansweort -in the period Nov. El - Bqq.8,c* WWZx&amp;J as,      Sffficulties have arisen over the proposed Swissloan to H.M. Government.     Switzerland is demanding extravagant ooiiiponsation-tonnage to carry  40,000 tons of imports in the next four months;, and the terms suggested as to security and interest are unfavourable.     She Swiss probably anticipate that, if the Allies reduce the scale of their contracts with Swiss munition factories,-the Gorman Government will he glad of the opportunity to place new orders in Switzerland,
62553ga AffiifHIS-      &apos; he Argentine Government have not yet come toterms on the question  of our proposed grain purchases. Sir 2. Sowar has &quot;been instructed to join with his French and American colleagues in presenting a definite and final offer, &quot;which must he accepted or rejectee &quot;before Jan.15.      We are not entirely at the mercy of the Argen-tine Government;    it is unlikely that any other purchaser can find sufficient tonnage or hunker-coal for the trans-port at ion of the Argentine5s surplus cereals, so long as the war continues.      If the Argentine Government, refuse our proposals, they will he gambling on the prospects of an early peace.810*  ISM&apos;^j^mdmlii^mm*   Dhe following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period Bec.l4- 0, 191? inclusive.
