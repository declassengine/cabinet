E.L.S. 1222, Paris.11th December 1917. &quot;3       A\ NOTE FROM LT.-C0L. SPIERS FOR COLONEL FAGALDE,The French Military Attache at Washington wires with regard to progress of training in America, that individual instruction was begun in the case of the national guard divisions about October 1st, for the national army divisions and the recruits for the regular army about November 1st,     This instruction should be completed in the course of the month of January9The instruction of specialists has been delayed owing te the lack or insufficiency of instructional materiel; infantry specialists began their training between November 15th and December 1st, and engineers (with still inadequate materiel) about December 1st.Except in certain regiments of the regular army and national guard, the training of small units has hardly been beguntArtillery instruction remains a serious problem owing to the small number of American instructors available,, and the lack of materiel.   Artillery instruction must be considered as only beginning from December 1st--   :Measures are being taken to distribute the 3 inch artillery materiel in a more satisfactory manner than at present among the various instructional camps; each divisional camp will shortly possess some 3 Inch guns.   The question of asking General Pershing to send over some 75 mam* guns from among those allotted to the divisions already in France has been considered, but the Chief of the American General Staff has not yet dared to formulate such a demand,The French Military Attache suggests that old French guns which are still usable might be sent across for instruction purposes as was done for Yale university; at least two 75 m,m. guns per camp would be required, or 64 in all.   He considers that at present it is certain that the artillery training will be behind that of the Infantry, and thus it is necessary that the American artillery camps In France should be utilised at the highest possible pressure, and American artillery regiments sent to France for training as rapidly as possible.   No Director of American artillery has yet been appointed, although the importance of such an appointment being made has been several times pointed out.The cadres of - the American artillery are entirely inexperienced; except for a few hundred regular officers, none of them have ever fired a gun.The French Military Attache concludes, that unless measures are rapidly taken, delay must be expected in American army&apos;s entry into the field next year.
