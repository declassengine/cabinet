(This To current Is the. Property of His Britannic KajestyVs Government) -C R E T .    3096.REPORT -toWAR   0 A B I fl S Tllllllll II l$i7AR C A3lira LABOUR C0*VITTS2on12      PER CENT BONUS DTLEEKAThe War Cabinet Labour Committee was appointed on November 27th by War Cabinet linute.Its primary duty was laid down to be to harmonise the work of the different Government Departments in the adjustment and settlement of labour questions,      It was secondly understood to have a special duty to interpret and apply the Skilled Time-workers (Engineers and I &quot;oulders) Wages Order 1917 made by the I inlster of Funltions conceding a bonus of 12??% -per cent on earnings to all time-paid skilled, men in the engineering and foundry industries in receipt of a time rate not less than the district fitters arid turners rate and employed upon Munitions work..The Committee on its appointment found itself faced with the above mentioned order and also by a Govern-ment announcement which appeared in the Press on November 22nd that the Government had decided to pay the bonus of 12h% on earnings not merely to time-paid skilled men in the engineering and foundry industries but also to time-paid semi-skilled and unskilled men In those industries and to all men skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled in the ship-building and ship-repairing industries.The Committee inherited a problem well-nigh insoluab The issue of the Order in question&apos;had started a wide-spread agitation which no?; involves the Government in the necessity o paying the 125^ bonus or an equivalent to all classes of workpeople or of facing, determined and possibly successful stoppages of industrial work and production.It has been estimated that this increased, wage of &apos;U In the  1 to all workmen of every class and. description means a national cost of say  100,000,000 sterling or more. It Is obvious that very far reaching economic financial.-industrial consequences to the nation hang upon the decision which the Government must take., either to pay or to refuse to pay any such all round, bonus of 12J- per cent.Hitherto almost all wage Advances since the war have been &quot;granted on the economic . ground of increased, cost of living.     Tbe bonus of 12^-f has not been granted on any economic ground..      It was originally proposed in order to remedy &quot;the skilled man&apos;s grievance&quot;.      It has now
assumed in the eyes of -workmen the character of a preferential dole to a section of Industry.     In presence of such a dole the whole working class community claims equality of treatment and universality of state beneficence,   . It may be said that the Government both. could, and should draw a line dividing participants from non-participants, but no such line will justify itself to ar bo roe opted by- the industrial world...

In many Engineering works there are working alongside the mernvers of the engineering and -foundry trades who have been conceded t:,e bonus, trades like electricians, bricklayers and plumpers who do not receive the bonus.     If they, receive the bonus.the rest of their fellow members &quot;in the respective&apos;trades not working in the shop but generally throughout the country e.,g. in the bull dim&quot; trades must receive-, it.     Similarly there pre members of the engineering trade -enjoying the.bonus employed in greater or less number In most of the. different industrial establishments in the country.These difficulties- have already led to the 12- per cent bonus being paid by Employers and even by Government Departments to classes-of workmen outside&apos;the original Order.In our opinion the Government are faced with give fa possible alternatives:- ^(1)   strict.: adherence to present Orders, without any, extension.     This&apos; course as indicated in the- foregoing statements we consider to be Impra ct icable.(?)    To extend it to piece workers in the tradessoecified in the form of a guarantee to piece workers that 12- per cent shall, he added to quA**^**5B  theiri time rates, this, however, to be minus0 earnings over such time,rate and to adviserevision of rates so as to encourage working by systems,of payment by results.It)(3) A wide extension of the 12bonus  (or an equivalent).. t o all classes.A bold withdrawal of the... present Orders with a frank confession that a.mistake has been made and. that in view of the -expenditure and the&apos;necessities.of the nation the advance cannot be continued.This -proposal could possibly be annexed to any assurances with regard, to stability of food prices and. restriction of profits which the Government may feel ah1o to make,-, and the stronger these are the better will be the chance of acceptance of this withdrawal and. of admission that the action of the Government it justifiable.There are indications that some Trade Union leaders already regard this course as the only practicable solution. It is nevertheless impossible to disregard the probability, if not the certainty of considerable industrial disturbances resulting.
while industrially this course is in our opinion one which would cause dlstrubance but- possibly no greater . disturbance, than continued demands for extension It- is- stated that for international and&apos;political reasons the recommendation .would not be;practicable.   &apos; Under these circumstances and without .any&apos;endorsement of the present orders or of any. extension of orders and with no certainty   that present concessions;&apos; can&quot; be a.limit we can only suggest an.order as in terms of the report of. the Sub-Committee Bet up by. the Committee appointed by War Cabinet 304 minute 2,24th.
