SECRET.OPERATIONS.From      G.O.C. in CEgypt.Despatched 6.20 p.m.14.12.17.C.I.G.SWar Office.   Received 11.25 p.i.xE.A.598.   December 14th.       Your 47761 Cipher December 12th. I consider it essential, at present season with rains imminent and after recent experience of effect of comparatively small rainfall, that any advance northward during -next two months can only be made step by step; owing to badness of roads I must depend on the progress of my railway.     After January weather will keep on improving and in this part of Palestine summer weather is more suitable fdr campaigning than winter.     I accordingly propose first, as essential, to advance to the line of the Wadi Auja flowing east and the Wadi El Jib \7adi Abu Lejja Hahr Auja flowing west and to consolidate on that line. Secondly I hope to operate against Hedjaz railway during wet i season, and while waiting for my railway to overtake me, as there are still twenty thousand Turks south,of Amman.     If found\i practicable this seems to offer best prospect of exploitingi success already gained.     Thirdly, if circumstances are favour-able I may gradually push forward my left towards Tul Keram covering railway construction and perfecting preparations for -offensive with ITaval co-operation.     Either as a reinforcement on this front or in the improbable event of trouble arising in We stern Desert, the division from Llesopotamia will be very valuable.vide War Cabinet 296/5.
