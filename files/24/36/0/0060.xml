SECRETPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDUREMemor anduwiLyOn June. 7th 1917 the War Cabinet decided thatthe Minister of ReconstructionParliament should be asked to appoint a Select Joint Committee of both Houses to consider the machinery of Parliamentary procedure for the period following the termination of War, and it was arranged that the leaders of both Houses should take the necessary action after consultation with Mr. Montagu.I am-disposed to think that it is not necessary to make special provision for a review of the procedure of the House of Lords.       In other respects, I am of opinion that steps should be taken to give effect to the decision of the War Cabinet as a matter of urgency.careful study of the material which has been collected in my Department wiwh regard to the legislation involved in r e c ons true t i on,.will be arrived at, or the form of legislation,  it is evident that legislation of some kind or other will be necessary to deal with all or most of the subjects ofregarded as likely to arouse little or no controversy;, with regard to others the only point on which it can safely be said that most people will be agreed is that they must bemany of them,  it is not enough that the schemes shall have Leen prepared in my.own or other Departments before the War ends:    It is essential that the legislation shall have been passed and the machinery set in operation by that time..I have arrived at this conclusion after aWithout indicating the nature of decisions whichwhich a list is appendedSome of them may properIj bedealt with somehow.Moreover, with regard to a great
Therefore, however- -long, the War nay unfortunately be expected to last, Parliament cannot safely postpone one moment longer than it can avoid, the consideration anddisposal of them.The length of the Bill likely to be required in a -oarticular case, depends upon the method adopted for dealing with It.       This nay be either -(l)      a short general Bill enabling the appropriate Department to legislate by Order in Council or otherwise:    or(P.)     a detailed measure setting out the provisionswhich It Is desired to enforce on each subject.. The former method would, no doubt,  shorten the labours of Parliament, though even so the list of measures would bo formidable.     But the experience of the Imports and Exports Restriction Bill, and the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bill does not indicate that this method of legis-lation is generally acceptable.     If,therefore, the second method is adopted, the congestion of Parliamentary business under the existing procedure, bearing in mind the necessity of dealing simultaneously with measures and business necessary for the conduct of the War, would be so great that it Is practically certain that the work would not be completed In time.A Select Committee was appointed on February 23rd 1914 &quot;to consider and report whether any, and if so, what, alterations are&apos;desirable In the practice and procedure of this House with regard to public business.&quot;     But at the outbreak of War, It had not concluded its labours, although It had read a second time a draft report brought up by the Chairman, Sir T. Whittaker, and had taken a great deal of evidence.       It recommended (July 22nd 1914) &quot;that a Committee be appointed to deal with the subject In the next
session of Parliament,&quot; bait owing to the outbreak of War this was not done.     Any Committee now appointed would have the advantage of studying the. Evidence and Draft Report of that Committee, hut owing to the changed circumstances and trie different purpose now in view, would no doubt have tc approach, the matter do novo.The list of Committees dealing with, matters relating to Reconstruction now under preparation in my Department already shows a total of 92,  including all sub-committees, and there are a number of important subjects under consideration, with regard to some of which the appointment of additional committees has been suggested, While some of these committees are dealing with matters unlikely to involve legislation, the majority are likely to suggest- some, and a number to suggest a great many, changes in the lav:.The list of Emergency Statutes passed during the present War, also prepared for my Department, already shows a total of 147, and with, regard to a very large proportion of these it will he necessary to Introduce legislation providing either for their continuance with or without modifications,for	the fine and manner of their termination. Some of the more&apos; important of these are:-	1. -	Wational Registration Act 1915.	2.	Ministry of Munitions Act 1915.	3.	Munitions of War Acts 1915 to 1917.	4.	Hew Ministries and Secretaries Act 1916.	5.	Small Holdings Colonies Act 1916.	6. .	Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest Act 1(	3157.	Courts Emergency Powers Acts 1914 - 1917,	8.	Land Drainage Act 1914.	9,	Fishery Harbours Acts 1915 - 1917.	10.	War Charities Act 1916.	
il: grimmer Tine Act 1913.12, Billeting of Civilians Act 1917,13. Price of Coal  (Limitation) net 1915.11, Grand Juries Suspension Act 1917.15. Workmen&apos;s Compensation (War ArWItion) Act 1917.16. Clubs  (Temporary Provisions) Act 1915.1.1,        .. 8.1     uud..;   iiuo    j-^-j-o,,13.    Municipal Savings Banks Act, 1916. And above all;-19.    The Defence of the Realm Actsi   while it is notsuggested that then should remain in force In any-thing like their present form, many of the subjects controlled by the Regulations must continue to be dealt with in some way or other at least for some time after the War.20.    The Aliens Restriction Act, to which the same reznarks apply.      It Is necessary to-deal with the position of Alien enemies now interned and with tho general position of aliens of all nationalities In the future A number .of Bills which have already been introduced are likely to take up some time in the coming year Education.National Insurance (Part l) Amendment, Patents and Designs, i Trade Maries. Imports and Exports Restriction. Non-Ferrous Metal Industries.Among the subjects under consideration by various Committees&apos;, the following are specially urgent, and will involve considerable legislative changes. - 1,   Acquisition of Powers. 2,   Acquisition and Valuation of Land.These two lie at the root of many of the schemes
of Reconstruction which have been put forward byo tnor C oranii 11e e s. 3.    Land Settlement for Soldiers, and generally. 4...   Forestry.&quot;&apos;5.    Other- Land questions,  and particularly the TownTenant ques t i on. 6,   Electric Supply.7,    Commercial questions:    Lord Balfour of Burleigh Committee&apos;s Report contains 46 paragraphs of conclusions, of which at least 16 Involve legislation.8.   Demobilisation:    this involves legislation, possibly on Re-instatement., and-certainly on Unemployment Insurance, probably Implying a general revision of the latter,  in coniunction with the question of Civil War Workers.. 9.    The Health Questions    involving possible legislation to establish a Ministry of Health, to re-organise the functions of Local Bodies dealing with Health, and consequential reforms.10,    Poor Law Reform:    partly involved In the Health question.11.    Housing:    together with the questions of BuildingMaterials and Bye-Laws. 12.   Education:    branches of the subject not dealt with inthe existing Bill.These lists neither exhaust the subjectslikely to require legislative treatment, nor adequately indicate the extent of legislation involved by each:    but they afford some idea of the great volume and complexity- of them, and the impossibility of dealing with them without special machinery.C. ADDISON20th December 1917.
