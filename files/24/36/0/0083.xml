SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information, FIW/022WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   ITALY.   XXII.(Dec. 21st, 1917)Parliament anff Government.On December 12th Parliament resumed its session.    The &quot;Communications from the Government&apos; which stood first on the Orders of the Day took the form of a speech by the Prime Minister, Signor Orlanda, in v/hich he reviewed the situation national and international.     Hisreferences to the wonderful recovery of the Italian Army in spite of all sorts of difficulties and to the fraternal assistance of France and Great Britain called forth loud applause from the v/hole Chamberwas present, and a few of his followers are reported to have remained ostentatiously neutral.     The more important passages of the speech are summarised below:Economic and Financial Situation in Italy.Italy was, even in peace ti$e, dependent upon imports for the necessaries of life.     The war had greatly increased her heeds and her dependency on supplies from abroad.     This situation would not be at once changed by the arrival of peace.     There must be increase of production and diminution of consumption;   better Government organi-sation and better discipline among citizens.The Finances of the Kingdom were in a satisfactory position, but the question of Exchange was a grave one. It could only be met by co-ordinated action. Measures were being taken by the Government. The Country&apos;  *aebt to her Soldiers.The Government had arranged for the issuing of free Insurance polities to the amount of 500 or 1000 lire to soldiers or to their relations.     These policies could be realised at once on conditionwith the exception of the Official Socialists.Giolitti &amp;lsot who
that the proceeds were invested in land or instruments of production, or realisation could be deferred for a period of years during which interest would accumulate.    The measure was calculated to prove to the men who were fighting that the country was not ungrateful to them and at the same time to help in the work of reconstruction after the war.     The Government was fully alive to the need for being fore-armed in regard to such Reconstruction.     Italian industries had undergone a striking expansion during the war and this expansion must not suffer in the transformation which peace would entail.Increase of Agricultural production was no less important ana would be furthered by wise legislation and the extended application of machinery and scientific methods.Events in Russia could not be a subject of rejoicing.     The present regime was neither representative^ior constitutional and the Allies were waiting until some Government should be established which could speak in the name of Russia,     The consequence of this anarchy was serious enough for the Allies, but they still retained the factors of victory and it only remained to put them to the best use by co-ordinating fcheir activities.Steps towards this Co-ordination wore marked by the meetings ofRapallo and by the Conference ooened in Paris on Nov. 29th.     Intothe details of the decisions there taken he oould not enter but hecould say thus muoh - that the guiding principle had been the poolingof resources and requirements and that &apos;the decisions taken gavethem the assurance that the combined efforts of all the Allies would^e directed to seeing that Italy should not fall short of food or1coal or the raw materials needed for the prosecution of the war.The liberation of Jerusalem and the declaration by the United States of war on Austria-Hungary were referred to with high appre-ciation.
The Cenfral Empires professed a. desire for peace, but wrapped their terms in a cloud of ambiguities with the aim of sowing suspicion between the Allies and depressing the spirit of their peoples.     The rest of the world had one sole end in view - a definite and honoura^f^e peace which would prevent  or ever the renewal of the outrages whieh had menaced humanity and which weiuld allow all peoples  reat or small to realise their natural politioal, social and economic development; on such terms Italians were ready as ever for peace, convinced as they were that it would be criminal in any Government to prosecute the war beyond the limit absolutely imposed by the war&apos;s essential aim.     Mean-while Italy proclaimed herself proud to fight in a just cause and pre-served intact her faith in i s triumph.After Signor Orlando had spoken, discussion arose oh a proposal for a Secret Session which was accepted by the Government, made a question of confidence and carried by 274 to 63 votes.Int the Senate the interpellation, of whioh Signor Tittoni had given notice, on the employment of the legislative powers conferred on the Executive during the war, is reported to have been postponed after a rather heated discussion.The Governmentfs acceptance of the Secret Session represents its side of the compromise arrived at in regard to the 1 Parliamentary Union&apos;s* demand for Commissions of Control.     The Union on its oart, on a hint from Giolitti, agreed to drop its demand for the time being -that is (if we may trust the very well-informed Parliamentary Correspondent of tho Giolittian Stampa ) until the results of the Secret Session should have made it clear whether ot no satisfrctory MBtttinoes can be obtained regarding Parliamentary control of war-policy.Of what has been tr.king pl..ce in the Secret Session no details f:re procurable, but it is known that very violent attacks were made both
on Baron Sonnino end General Cadorna.     In the. case of the former the attack was led by the Socialist group, and supported by Giolittians and Catholics * probably also by certain Radicals and Democrats to whom Sonnino is politically antipathetic.     The suspect character of the main body of the anti-Sonninians determined, as on former occa-sions in the Italian Chamber, a rallying of Interventionist   elements of all groups, taking shape in the reorganisation of the Psrty of Notional Defence.   The Secret   Sittings wereSconclu&amp;ed on Dec. 18th and it eppears from Telegrams to the Piress that )the result was to assure for the moment the position of Baron Sonnino.General Cadorna&apos;s enemies are of two categories - those who more or less on technical grounds hold him responsible for the recent disasters on the Isonzo front and those - the extreme Socialists -who hate him as the embodiment of the War Spirit and Military Discipline and need to cloak their own responsibility.Though the Government apoears to have presented during the Secret Sittings a solid front to the opposition, it is difficult to believe that this solidarity will endure for long.     The spirit animating the present Government is pronnuncedly democratic and anti-imperialistand can hardly coniist permanently with Sonnino&apos;s decidedly re-actionary and anti-democratic opinions and temper.     Democrats can never forget or forgive the support hegave to General Pelloux -famous for his savage suppression in 1898 of Socialist and Democratic agitations.     If he is retained for the moment it is only because the dangerous situation in which Italy finds herself gives special value to the trust which Italyfs Allies  y$pgse in Sonnino and to his proved capacity and his upright character. Moral of Army and People.The shortage of food is trying the moral of the Army and of the labouring and poorer classes generally.     Meat rations for the men
behind the fighting line have had to be reduced and comparison with the rations and rate of pay of the Allied troops seems to be accentua-ting&apos;- the discontent among the soldiers.Reference has already been made in our summary of Signor OrlandoTs speech to the grant of free Insurance Policies to soldiers or their dependents.     It is hoped in this way to facilitate in some way the resumption of normal occupation on demobilisation.MeaaWhlle arrests of suspected persons continue, but no details of proceedings are forthcoming as yet.An increase of activity in War propaganda is also noticeable. Exchange.The Government has recently taken steps to impreve the state of the exchange and has set up a National Exchange Bureau which is to have a monopoly of foreign securities and to exercise control over imports.     It is attached to the Treasury bgt has independent powers. The Vatican.The clause in the secret Treaty published by the Bolsheviks re-ferring to the exclusion of the Vatican from eventual Beace-negotia-tions has naturally produced a good deal of irritation among Catholics. Kept within strict bounds in the press this irritation probably found expression during the recent secret sittings.   Notice of a question to be asked in the Chamber had been handed in by the Catholic Deputy Longinotti, and Count Delia Torre, President of the Catholic Union, has addressed a letter on the subject to the Prime-Minister,
