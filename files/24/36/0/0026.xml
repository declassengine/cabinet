From Political, Bagdad, lith December 1917.(Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary 0f Slate for Indiaand Teheran.)(Received at India Office 16th, 6 a.m.)6015. My telegram 5993, dated :1.3th December. It may be convenient if I put (you?) in possession of an appreciation of political situation in Southern Persia as viewed from here.Southern Kurdistan--Please see my Memorandum No. 10111, dated 7th December in post. Attitude of bulk of tribes and chiefs definitely anti-Turk and &apos; decrease of Russians is likely to ease situation rather than otherwise. I hope shortly to send Major Soane, who is now at Khanikin and has special knowledge of district and exceptional qualifications for influencing the tribes, to see what he can do to organise them with view to harrying Turkish communications and generally to commit themselves (by their ?) pro-British (policy ?). The prevailing famine conditions are, however, a difficult factor.Kermanshah and Kalhor. The whole of this district, thanks to alternate Turkish and Russian invasions, is unstable and mercenary to a degree. I think Colonel Kennion should be provided with an assistant to enable him to get into closer touch with tribal leaders and to make suitable arrange-ments to fill gap caused by defection of our Russian allies. I shall endeavour to send one shortly,Pushtikuh. The Vali is unsatisfactory, and at heart pro-Turk, but I do not think he is likely to depart from his attitude of neutrality, especially now that Russians are likely to disappear from the scene. Parties passing between here and Kermanshah through Pushtikuh are well treated.Luristan. I have had an officer on special duty at (&quot; Kiang&quot; or &apos;! Khorremabad &quot;) and Burujird during hot weather, and reports received to-day from him show that tribes, whilst full of conceit at repulse of detachments of Russians, Persians and Germans pass(ing through?) their country at different times are well disposed towards the British, and no hostile action in this direction need be anticipated. We should, however, have a political officer in Lnristan to watch events and guide them as far as possible, and I am endeavouring to arrange this.A rain stan. So long as we maintain our present forces at Ahwaz and Shush and oil-fields, and do not relax our political control of Dizful and Sinister, no unfavourable local developments seem probable.Bahhtiiiri. I am strongly of the opinion that we should support more actively than at present existing Illkhani and that to keep touch with situation we should have two- political officers available for duty in this district. Captain Noel has been detained at Baku for the present under orders from His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Petrograd, and his future movements seem uncertain. Should it have been decided to detail him for other work, it is most important that a thoroughly competent officer be selected to succeed him, who should be assisted by an Intelligence Division Officer. I will, make suggestions should occasion arise. In above connection since my telegram 5200, dated 17th November, I have received from India Office, copy of a .P.O.C. letter, dated 4th October (192014) to Foreign Office, which emphasises need for supporting him (Sardar Zafar), and I think that we should send the arms he requires, and if necessary, the mountain guns which would have been given in 1.916 but for Russian susceptibilities.Ramadan-Ai Russians are retiring, Jiamadan will become a very weak link in our political chain. .1 venture to urge need for stronger repre-sentation there, preferably by a military-political officer in touch with this Force.lars. Provided that the situation in Shiraz is maintained, and South Persia Rifles retain their present hold on situation, I do not think situation need cause us anxiety.   The same applies to Kerman.
