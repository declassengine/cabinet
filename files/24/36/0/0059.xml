his Document is the Property ofColonel Jones185SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Weekly Report on France. XIX-(December 20th, 1917.)Department of Information. FFV/019.The report of a fortnight ago spoke of the possibility of the Malvy &apos;affaire&apos; being followed by an raffaire Caillaux&apos;. This happened almost immediately, and already the question of ilalvy is almost forgotten in the excitement atiout the greater and more sinister figure.The facts so far known are, very briefly, these.     On Tuesday the 11th, a demand was made to the Chamber for a suspension of the immunity from prosecution enjoyed by Deputies in the case of two members, M. Caillaux and a certain M. Loustalot.     The Chamber following its usual practice referred the demand to a Committee., and the Committee has almost unanimously reported in favour of suspending the immunity.     The Chamber will consider its report in a day or two and M. Caillaux is going to defend himself.     The line that he and his friends of the Extreme Left and Socialist parties will probably take is that an ex-Prime Minister can only be tried by the High Court, that is the Senate, before which M. Halvy successfully demanded to be brought.     And they will create prejudice, not unnaturally nor even unjustly, by recalling the Vbry bad record of the Military Courts in the Dreyfus case which involved political passions of a somewhat similar kind, and will allege that Caillaux, notoriously hated both by the present Prime Minister and by the General Staff, would never have a fair trial before a Court Martial.     They will then try to transform the discussion of the charge of treasonable acts into a political debate on the opposite policies past and present of Caillaux and
his enemies: and so enable Caillaux to escape under cover of a cloud of party recriminations.If this manoeuvre succeeds M. Clemenceau will resign.     He told the Committee plainly that if the Chamber refused to sanction a prosecution the Government will refuse to go on.     And he justly added that if such presumptions as have been shown against Caillaux existed in the case of an ordinary man he would have been brought to trial without discussion as a matter of course.     So much seems clear, though it appears that M* Painleve declares privately that when in power he asked M. Barthou to report to him on the matter and that Barthou reported that he found no case to go on against Caillaux.    Probably - after what has been revealed of the way in which documents in the hands of Government Departments have been kept from the magistrate dealing with the case - the explanation of this is that Barthou did not see all the evidence.The charges made by General Dubail in the long document submitted to the Chamber are briefly these.     Pirst that though a month ago Caillaux declared that he had not exercised any influence over the &apos;Bonnet Rouge * newspaper since July 1914, letters in the possession of the police show that he was in fact, certainly up to the early part of the present year and perhaps longer, on the most intimate terms with the Editor and other members of that paper, most of whom have since been arrested under a charge of communicating with the enemy.     Second, that both Caillaux and Louetalot were closely concerned withQavallini, the accused Italian ex-deputy, in Bolo^ dealings through the 28x-Khedive with the Central Powers.     Third, that when he visited Italy in the autumn of 1916, ostensibly on account of his \7ifets health, he in fact engaged in intrigues with Cavallini and othernotoriously pro-German personages, three of whom have since beenm&apos;        -    &quot;arrested; that the object of these.intrigues waB to persuade Italians .that Prance would be entirely exhausted by the spring of
1917, when M. Cai^laux would resume office and make peace:   that&quot; Italy should prepare in the same way for a separate peace ahout whioh Germany would be astonishingly generous to Italy while all the losses would fall upon Russia and upon our Balkan-Allies who would &apos;disapnear&apos;r   that as soon as peace was-made-prance would, enter into an alliance- with Germany, Italy and Spain against England and Russia &quot;out true enemies&quot; and General Dubail further declares that this in-trigue was so notorious that it was the subject of protests by the ambassadors and ministers of the Allied Powers as well as by the French Ambassador and Naval and Military Attaches, and that only the Cencorship prevented angry protests in the Italian Press.The document contains a good deal of criticism and matter.of opinion which would not find a place in a similar document in England. But it appears to make a prima facie case which would certainly have brought anyone else before the courts, and it seems certain that Caillaux will have to face a trial of some sort.     It is stated that Briand was opposed to his being accused   and in declining to serve on the Committee he took the line that if Caillaux should be shown to have acted with Almere^da and Bolo (with whom General IJubail shows him to have remained in confidential ahd almost affectionate relations even after Bolo was under police supervision) then he should be tried by Court Martial;    if only CaillauxTs doings in Italy were in question then the matter should go before the Senate.     What will be decided on this point it is as yet. impossible to say, but it would seem certain, if it were not for the unfortunate Malvy precedent, that M.Clemenceau would insist, and insist successfully, on a trial before the Military Court, just as Bolo and the rest are being tried.     The debate in the Chamber will no doubt be a trial of strength between Clemenceau and his enemies, who will rally round Caillaux if the long speech he intends to make gives them any chance of doing so.
i188The ultimate issue is one far greater than the fate of an individual.If Clemenceau,has given way to political and personal prejudice andhas allowed the soldiers to prosecute Caillaux on charges which theycannot sustain, he will fall, and there will he great danger of thenational spirit of France being involved in its fall, and capitulatingnot to Caillaux in person, but to the Extreme Left party, which isalways suspicious of the army and contains many conspicuous memberswho are decidedly luxe-warm about the war and, like Caillaux, notpasticularly averse from a deal with the Germans.     Both Calmenceauand Caillaux are men of marked ability, yet one or other of them musthave behaved very stupidly.     It will be strange if so acute a man asgreatClemenceau has, in the blindness of passion, ruined the/task he only undertook the other day, and risked the whole future of France, to whose service no one doubts that he is passionately devoted.     It will be strange if Caillaux has allowed his inveterate turn for intrigue to make him so far forget his usual self-interest as to risk the death of a traitor.     But it is hard to avoid thinking one or the other must be the. case.     The only escape from that dilemma would be to suppose that Clemenceau, out of an excess of honesty, had decided that evidence which was sufficient for a charge against any ohscure indi-vidual was also sufficient against an ex-Prime Minister, irrespective of the danger to the State involved in such a charge against such a man, unless there were a practical certainty of conviction.     But in any case there is at least this to the good.     Clemenceau has not be-lied the great reputation for courage which brought him back to power. He has risked everything for the sake of daylight and no one in France any longer fears that things are being hushed up or important persons sheltered.     This in itself is an immense gain - But the permanence of that gain will depend on whether the ease against Caillaux turns out to be strong or weak.
On the whole the probability must be that the evidence is very strong, and that there is a good deal to come which is not set out in General Dubail&apos;s letter of accusation.     Caillaux has lied so lately and so outrageously in his assertions that he had no very close relations with Bolo, or the &apos;Bonnet Rouge&apos;, that it must surely be difficult for him, now that those relations are manifest, to obtain very much credence for any more assertions of innocence however eloquent, which he may out into the speech he is to make. Disclaimers of guilt will not do any longer in view of the company he is proved to have kept, the company of men who, though not yet condemned, are universally regarded as undoubted traitors.   He will be asked fcr proof, and it seems certain that whatever happens he himself is for some time to come politically finished.     Keeping clos company with traitors is not the same thing as treason, but it will uurely be enough to make a man impossible as a Prime Minister or even the leader of a party;    especially when that man was already what he is freely called by writers, some of whom would not naturally be hostile, the most unpopular man in France.     He was not pomlar be-fore and, since all France has seem, what Germany is, the man who has always stood, and still stands, for German influence has become the most detested of names, one held up to scorn by the very street boys scribbling on the wallsStill he has a personal following, as is shown by the tone of suchpapers as Le Pays and the Socialist organs.     They repudiate hisanti-English and pro-German policy:   but they are drawn to sympathisewith him by a more or less common political past and still more.bythe.foolish violence of the reactionary press which demands hisblood almost before his accusation has bTen read.     If he shouldobtain a technical acquittal, all this feeling against Celmenceauu)and against Caillaux&apos;s enemies generally fcould be multiplied a&apos;
-Ill II 190- 6 -hundredfold:    and though Caillaux is probably too much &quot;damaged goods1 for further use in public at present, he would be behind the scenes, and the men who really care for victory would have suffered a fatal, loss of credit which would give great scope for his subter-ranean intrigues.One word may be added about the law.     Affectionate letters to traitors are not treason.     The important question will be whether Caillaux^s doings in Italy can be brought under the Penal Code, which declares that &quot;Whoever has practised machinations or maintained in-telligences with foreign powers or their agents in order to engage them to commit hostile acts or undertake war against Prance, or to procure them the means of doing so, shall be punished with death&quot;. &quot;This disposition&quot; it is added &quot;applies even if such machinations have not resulted in actual hostilities&quot;.     And, what is very impor-tant, o later clause declaresthat the oenalty is the same whether the offence be committed against prance or against her Allies,      There would appear to be a strong presumption, if General Dubail&apos;s statement about Caillaux&apos;s doings in Italy can be proved, that at least as against England and Russia, they would bring him under the terms of the Clause:    and if it can be shown, as General Dubail asserts, that he tried to force Prance to peace by bringing Italy first into a sep-arate peace, that would be surely treason against Prance.     But of course on thess points no oninion but that of a French lawyer can be on any real value.     Other clauses under which Caillaux&apos;s actions might be brought are quoted from the Cede such as one punishing with death &quot;communications with the enemy with a view to favouring his enterprises. &quot;The Caillaux 1 affaire&apos; is the one absorbing subject in Prance at present:   and fortunately there are notmany others that need be touched on here,    The great strike of metal workers in the Loire district, to which allusion was made in the last Report, was quickly
steeled.     The Press was not allowed to say anything about it duringthe few days that it lasted,and, as far as is known, only theSocialist Humanity has mentioned it since,     It grew out of amilitant syndicalist being sent back to his regiment as a punishmentfor pacifist propaganda, and the suspicion that he was really pun-ished for syndicalist views.     All parties seem to have behavedextremely well.     The Government promised reconsideration of the man&apos;case before the mixed Commission of masters aifid men recently set upto deal with difficulties in the works, the man was given short leaveto prove to his comrades that he was not being persecuted, and theworkers returned at once to work.     No act of violence or sabotageof any kind occurred during the few days of the strike.President Wilson&apos;s and Mr, Lloyd George&apos;s speeches have been verywarmly received.     Mr   Wilson&apos;s reference to economic pressure isparticularly welcomed by many writers who see in that weapon by farthe surest way of forcing Germany to accent out peace.     Perhapsthis view is best put by the Debats whish says, &quot;if we could con-vince the Germans that there is a strict and implacable relationthe prolongation of the war and between/the prolongation of their commercial isolation, there wouldbe a good chance of seeing the war quickly shortened&quot;.     This maybe considered in the light of the considerable amount of evidenceof German fears on this subject.There has been a certain amount of complaint, not only inSocialist quarters,i-bout the failure of the Allies to re-state theirwar-aims, and the Debats confesses its disappointment with the AlliedConference and with Mr. Lloyd Georgers speech in that respect.    Itdesires to see restated at least our moral and political conditionsof peace and deolares that only by so doing can we keep up thespirits of our friends the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Croats and others.It would like to see a Society of the Allies founded at once whatever
the future may bring forth in the way of a Society of Nations.Nothing further has been announced about the bread cards, and the Debats declares that the people of Paris never lived so well as they are living to-day, contrasts the condition of Germany, and calls for self-sacrifice for the sake of the ill-fed Allies, expecially the Greeks.
