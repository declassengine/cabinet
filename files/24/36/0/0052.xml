T^aj^riiajnsc teiajssty s Government.)KA7AL ASPECT OF ITALIAN SHTTATIOH. val Staff Memorandum for Supreme War Council.As long as Venice dees not fall,, from the Naval point of view the situation in the Adriatic remains unaltered, except that the Italian railways, being fully taken up with supplying the British and French Divisions on the Italian Front, are net at present available for the transport of troops to Egypt and Salonika, sc that Transports have to sail from Marseilles instead of from TSaranto.    This involves the use of larger ^transports and an inoreased number of escorting ships owing tc the longer l&amp;cyage.This situation will shortly be improved, provided that conditions remain the same as at present.    Three trccp trains weekly with trccps for Eg.ypt and Salonika will shortly oommenoe to run tc Ifcrantc, the capacity cf each train being abcut 800; the first Transport is expected to ?.eave Taranto for Egypt on 29th December.As regards cur oonanunicat ions with Egypt and Salonika consequent on the Tarantfc route being closed for troops and stores, the situation is as follows,     Taranto was being used for the conveyanoe of 600 tons of stores a day tc Egypt and Salonika: this was to have been increased to 1,200 tons a day, and it was hoped at a later date to work up to a considerably larger total. The effect cf closing the route is, therefore, that it becomes necessary to convey 18,000 tens of stores per month from the United Kingdom to the Eastern Hediterranesn by sea throughout f.   involving the use of (say) 4 large ships instead of conveying the same quantity cf traffic by cross channel transport tc Cherbourg, and thence by rail to Taranto, and from Tarante tc Egypt and Salonika in comparatively small ships.    This implies a distinct less in the utilisation of tonnage, besides exposing 19.12.17.
more valuable ocean-going ships to the dangers of the Mediterranean.

With regard to Troops, the Taranto route was capable of dealing with about 800 a day, but it was never necessary to work up to this total, although heavy fighting might have made it necessary. The War Office forecast of troops to be conveyed between 7th November and 7th January was :-

To Egypt .... 12,000

To Salonika..  9,000

or an average of about 350 a day.

So far as shipping is concerned, the conveyance of troops via Marseilles instead of via Taranto can be arranged, though as has been pointed out the adoption of the Marseilles route involves the employment of larger ships for the purposes of transport and both ships and troops will be exposed to much more risk than in the case of transport by the Taranto route.

As long as Venice is available as a naval base, the Ancona - Brindisi railway can be afforded the same measure of naval protection as formerly.

Should Venice be lost, the naval situation in the Adriatic would be altered for the worse. There is no naval base between Venice and Brindisi, though Ancona and Bari can be used to a certain extent by submarines and torpedo craft. The Italian Fleet is based at Taranto and the naval defence of the coast and important railway communications would devolve upon submarines and mines. Ancona is only 78 miles from Pola, whereas it is 270 miles from Brindisi, 382 from Corfu, and 405 from Taranto.

II The Austrians might net care tc risk their heavy shipsf against Italian submarines for carrying out any extensivej ccast bombardments* but raids by light craft with the objectJ of cutting railway communication would almost certainly beJ: made, and would be exceedingly difficult to frustrate.I) Minelaying cn a very large scale will probably be resorted toI by Italy.II The Admiralty have already given 2,000 mines, which1 are mostly being laid off Otranto as an anti-submarine measure1 at the request of the Italian authorities.I Ihe effective use of armoured trains for theprotection of the ccast depends very largely on the organisation1 of the Intelligence system.It is understood that the Prenoh hav* provisionallyI agreed to supply three submarines to work in the Adriaticthough the arrangement has not yet been definitelyconcluded, and it is probable that, 3hould Venice fall, Italy would ask the Allies to lend her further submarines.(Signed)    J.
