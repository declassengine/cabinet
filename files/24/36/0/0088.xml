SECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending &quot;Wednesday, December 19, 1917.:M) PART I.-ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Supplies and Prices.Allied Purchases.-The &quot; Oldfield Grange,&quot; with 2,046,861 pounds of bacon and hams purchased for Government account in America, was lost through enemv action on December 11th. The &quot; Knight of the Thistle,&quot; with 1,106,892 pounds of bacon, hams, and shoulders purchased for Government account, has been sunk. Her cargo is a total loss.A further credit of 29,000,000 dollars has been obtained from the Treasury for January purchases in the United States and Canada, making a total of 51,000,000 dollars for that month. Mr. Owen Smith estimates the values of the various quantities for January as follows :  5,000 tons refrigerated meat     ., 2,000,0002,500 tons preserved meat -     -     -     -     - 1,700,00048,670 tons bacon and ham ----- 35,000,0008,000 tons lard -     -   &apos; -     -     -     - 5,200,0001,000 tons butter      -     -     -            -     - 1,000,0001,500 tons cotton oil -------   700,0002,000 tons oleo oil     -      -    --      -      -      - 1,000,0001,000 tons neutral lard     -            -      -     - 700,0003,348 tons preserved meat (military) -      -      - 2,600,00011,000,000 tins pork and beans -      -      -      --     - 1,200,000This is subject to revision.During the week ending December loth Mr. Owen SmiuVs Mission purchased 49,506,450 pounds of bacon and bams, approximate value 15,700,000 dollars, and 9,000,000 pounds of prime steam and refined lard, approximate value 2,504,000 dollars.Mr. Owen Smith cables that Mr. Hoover states that 11,000 tons of frozen beef will be available for shipment, every month during January, February, and March, and that these quantities could probably be increased to 50,000 tons for the three months.Mr. Hoover has been informed that there is no objection on the part of this Ministry for all purchases of oleo oil, stock oleo, margarine oleo, and stearine being-made through the Inter-Allied Oil Seeds Executive, . which is in the course of formation.In reply to an inquiry from the Ministry, Mr. Hoover cables that the experiments in the United States for re-tinning old milk cans are proving most satisfactory, and that two or three years is thereby added to the average life of the can at a cost of about one-third of a new can.As regards condensed milk, Mr. Owen Smith cables that he anticipates Mr. Hoover will permit exports ef this without restrictions during January.Arrangements have been made for an expert to sail from New York at once to superintend the construction of potato dehydration plants in this country. Technical details as to the methods employed in America have been received by cable.At a meeting of the Meat and Fats Executive on Wednesday, the Italian Representative made a strong plea for an increased amount of frozen meat for the Army,A   (33)1531-3   Pk 1   90  12/17   E &amp; S ACommodity.Dollars.Total  -51,000,000
Bacon, Earns, and Lard.- The needs of the Army have been further discussed with the Liaison Officer with the War Office. There should be no real difficulty in satisfying Army requirements. ...Certain difficulties which arose under the Distribution Scheme have been con-sidered. The question of retailers applying direct for their supplies to importers, thus cutting out the wholesaler, and the position of the Co-operative Wholesale Societies, have.been settled.This Ministry has communicated with the Treasury on the subject -of finance for Canadian purchases. It is considered essential that credits should be provided without delay.Conferences have been held, with multiple shopkeepers and with wholesalers, and the initial steps for the control of home produced bacon and hams are now being taken.Butler. The second distribution of butter under the Butter Distribution Scheme took place last Monday. The general licence for the importation of butter has been revoked by the Board of Trade at the request of the Ministry of Food to ensure that no butter shall come into the country on private account, and upset the scheme of distribution, and also to facilitate the purchase of butter abroad by the Ministry of Food.Cocoa. A Conference was held on the 18th December with representatives of the Cocoa trade to consider the steps necessary to regulate wholesale prices. It is known that the present price charged by importers for West African cocoa is excessive.Coffee. An Order has been made calling for returns of all coffee in bond on the 31st December 1917, with a view to bringing into circulation coffee at present held up for export or other purposes. The Order was framed in consultation with the Coffee Advisory Committee at its first meetingDried Fruits. In addition to the contracts specified last week, 200 tons of Indian sultanas have-been purchased for January and February shipment in order to make a market in the event of our requiring future supplies.Distribution to manufacturers engaged on Government contracts has been com-pleted, and the bulk of currants and sultanas remaining has been distributed to the Admiralty, the Headquarters of the Red Cross Society, and to Ships&apos; Stores dealers, leaving a very small amount still to be distributed.Eggs. Negotiations are proceeding for considerable purchases of eggs on Government account in Denmark and Morocco, in the latter case by arrangement with the French Government.Feeding Stuffs. The three Orders setting up- port and provincial Feeding Stuffs Committees, providing licences for manufacturers, merchants, and dealers, and making amendments and additions to the Cattle Feeding Cake, and Meal, and Millers&apos; Offals (Maximum Trices) Order, have been drawn up and are now in the hands of the legal officers.A further Order dealing with the rationing of cattle and the issuing of priority certificates for dairy stock is now under consideration.Margarine. The Food Controller is preparing with the greatest possible expedition a scheme for the distribution of margarine based on an equal allowance per head of population in relation to existing supplies. In the meantime he has authorised those local authorities who have applied for permission to make arrange-ments on this basis in their own areas. The preparation of the general scheme involves the working out of a large mass of detail, which it is hoped may be completed in a very short time.Meat. A scheme for the control of prices of cattle bought by live weight and for the distribution of meat supplies has been prepared and has been approved by the Central Advisory Committee on Live Stock and Meat Supplies. The object of this scheme is to ensure the equitable distribution of such home-grown supplies of meat as may be available for civilian consumption. . The chief means which are considered necessary for putting this into operation are the ascertaining of the. normal require-ments of every butcher for his trade, the regulation of supplies of meat in different areas, the record and notification of all sales of cattle, and the levying of a &quot; per head &quot; charge on all cattle slaughtered in order to cover the expenses of sale by auction, valuation, insurance, slaughtering, railage,&apos; distribution, &amp;c.   As regards prices, the
scheme puts into complete effect the Food Controllers principle of fixing maximum prices for articles of food at all stages from the producer to the consumer. The machinery necessary for the working of this scheme has to.some extent already been set up. The Live Stock Commissioners already appointed to the 19 areas into which England, Scotland, and AVales are divided, are taking a detailed census of the live stock now in the country, and will be responsible for seeing that the numbers in their respective areas are not unduly depleted. These areas are to be subdivided into market districts which should coincide as far as possible with groups of Food Control Committee areas.For each of these market districts live stock agents will be appointed to be responsible to the Live Stock Commissioner, and work in conjunction with the Local Food Control Committees.Under the Meat (Control) Order all retail butchers and keepers of slaughter-houses are required to obtain certificates of registration and make returns to the Local Food Control Committees as to the meat handled on their promises, in order to act as Executive Organisations and to regulate market, practices.Wholesale Meat Supply Associations are being established in London and other main centres of the meat trade. Through these Associations supplies will be allocated to distributors in proportion to the requirement of the population, which will be particularly necessary in the event of temporary emergencies or of the necessity of commandeering supplies. KThis scheme cannot, however, he brought into operation until some time in January, and accordingly the Food Controller has issued an interim Order limiting the prices which may be paid for live stock until the new scheme can be brought into operation. The prices payable for any beast bought for slaughter must not exceed Is. per lb., this being the dead weight maximum price fixed by the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order; a sum not exceeding 2d. per lb. on the weight of the dressed carcase may he paid for offals, but if it should be found necessary, owing to short supplies, to obtain cattle from the farms, the Local Auctioneers&apos; Committees under the Army Cattle Purchase Organisation will be utilised. The following grades and prices (which are equivalent to the Is. 2c/. per lb. already mentioned) will apply, each with a maximum price for bulls, bullocks, heifers, and cows.j Bulls, Bullocks, and Heifers. Cows.Per cwt. Per cwTt.1st Grade 56 per cent: and over, lbs. 52 per cent, and over, 70s.2nd Grade 52 per cent, to 56 per cent., 70s.      46 per cent, to 52 per cent.,62.9.3rd Grade 48 per cent, to 52 per cent., 65s.      42 per cent, to 46 per cent.52s.4th Grade Under 48 per cent. Under 42 per cent.The interim Order further provides that from 27th December cattle shall only be sold at cattle markets except by licence given by or under the authority of the Food Controller. Powers are reserved to the Food Controller or Food Committees to make special regulations with regard to certain markets.Milk. The Condensed Milk [Returns) Order, .1917, dated December 14, 1917, requires all holders of condensed milk, or those who have bought it for importation into this country, to make known their stocks and purchases.An Order has been issued prohibiting the use of milk in the manufacture of chocolate-The Milk (Use in Chocolate) Order, No. 2, 1917, dated December 14, 1917, prohibits as from December 17th the use of milk in the manufacture of chocolate..Oils and Fats. -The output of margarine is practically at the maximum with the present machinery. Good progress is being made towards the completion of new-refineries and margarine&apos; making works. Unfortunately it has been found necessary further to restrict supplies to trades which are not food or glycerine producing industries, as the available stocks continue to fall rather rapidly. At present it is not possible to supply to the utmost edible oils to refineries, but it is hoped the restrictions referred to above will make this possible in the immediate future. These restrictions xmdoubtedly impose very great hardships on linoleum and paint making trades.Oil Seeds-The necessary arrangements to be made for the finance of Argentine Linseed and Olive Oil are not jet completed.   As far as the former is concerned it isa 2
to be hoped that it will be possible to arrange finance before the end of the year, as otherwise it would probably be too Jate to secure for this country a fair proportion of the linseed crop.Oil seeds and oils, which are being imported under control, are being allocated to the manufacturers according to their requirements.Sugar. During the past two weeks the issues of sugar have been nearly doubled as compared with the normal rate, so as to provide adequate stocks of sugar in the hands of- dealers and retailers ou the initiation in January of the new scheme of distribution as arranged by the Ministry of Food.The quantity of sugar used throughout Great Britain for manufacturing purposes during the present year was divided approximately as follows : Jam   - - - - - - -   20 per cent.Marmalade    -        -        -        -        - 7 per cent.Condensed milk       - -        -        - -    4 per cent.Drugs - - - - - 1-2 per cent.Beer and stout -        -        -        - -   .33 per cent.Sweets and confectionery     -        -        - -   18 per cent.Pastry ----- q*. per cent.Biscuits        - - - - - -    2-1- per cent.Candied peel ------     \ per cent.Mineral waters        -        -        -        - 2h per cent.Other beverages       - - - - ^ per cent.Other manufactures for human consumption - -    2-2- per cent.The total quantity of sugar required for Great Britain and Ireland during 1918 is estimated at 807,106 tons.tea. A meeting of the Tea Buyers&apos; Association has been held to consider the suggested rates of profit on Government tea. Mr. Pigott was invited to attend. The meeting decided, after lengthy discussion, that the proposed profits were insufficient, and agreed to select a deputation to visit this Ministry to put forward the views of the meeting.   A Conference has been arranged.A meeting has also been held with the retailers.Representatives cf the India and Ceylon Tea Associations came at the request of this Ministry to consider the advisability of balloting their teas during the transition period before all teas were sold on Government account. It was decided to adopt the ballot system from the 7th January, 1918.By the tea [provisional prices) order (no. .?), 1917, dated December 14, 1917, the maximum price of controlled tea from the 31st December, 1917, will be reduced to 3s. sd. per lb, and the maximum price of uncontrolled tea to 2s. sd. per lb. After the 15th January, 1918, controlled tea must not be sold mixed with uncontrolled tea, and blends of controlled tea must not be sold at a higher price than the maximum price of the lowest grade in the blend.The War Cabinet has decided to remove the embargo on the imports of China tea if tonnage is available for its carriage.Local Authorities.Reports from Divisional Food Commissioners show that the difficulties arising from unequal distribution of food have grown more acute.The meat shortage in South Shields and neighbouring areas is stated to be serious; the Elswick workers threaten to raid shops and down tools unless supplies improve. Grave discontent is reported from North Wales on account of the scarcity of necessaries; it is pointed out that this feeling may partly arise from shortage of beer. War Agricultural Committees are stated to be depleting districts of milk for the manufacture of cheese; this action is causing a shortage of butter and milk. Difficulty has been experienced in supplying Skye and the outer Hebrides with food owing to the indefinite periods which occur between the sailings from the mainland. In order to ensure the inhabitants a constant supply it is proposed to set up a store or stores of provisions locally, and to try to obtain priority in supplies from the Glasgow dealers.An experiment in communal feeding has been started at two centres in Edinburgh, and has proved a distinct success, showing a marked economy in food stuffs. The same method is about to be tried in Alloa.
Enforcement of Orders.Mr. E. P. Lickfold has been appointed to act as Solicitor to the Ministry in regard to prosecutions, and lie will in future conduct all cases in which the Ministry is prosecuting direct.Arrangements&apos; have,.-been made for obtaining full information regularly from Food  Control Committees with reference to all prosecutions and investigations instituted by them and for summarising and distributing the information thus -obtained.The following cases may. be noted : On December 17, John Thomas, a Walsall metal refiner, was fined 50Z. and also sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment for food hoarding. The goods found in his possession were confiscated; they included 422 lbs. of tea, 311 lbs. of bacon and ham, 175 lbs. of flour, 232 tins of meat and fish, 127 tins of tomatoes and fruits, 133 lbs. of biscuits.The Rector of Knodishall being found in possession of a sack of sugar when his motor car broke down, the sugar was returned to the grocer who had sold it. Fines of 51. on the grocer and 3L on the clergyman were imposed.Colonel Lornbe was prosecuted at Towcester on the 18th instant and fined 90L and 151. 15s. costs for having in his possession a large quantity of sugar, tea and coffee. The Chief Constable of Northampton,.sent a request to the Ministry that a London solicitor should be instructed in this case because he was afraid of the local prejudice in the district in the event of a local solicitor conducting the case. Mrs. Gundy was prosecuted at Stratford-on-Avon on the 17th and fined 101. and 10s. costs. Messrs. Bennett were also fined 25L for aiding and abetting, they being the wholesale firm,who had supplied a large quantity of tea to this lady.On the 18th December. Messrs. Leney &amp; Sons, brewers of Wateringbury, Kent, were fined 100L and 10Z. 10s. costs for excess(ve brewing.Cereals. On the 17th December, Arthur King was fined 51. for not registering as a miller under the Flour Mills Order, 1917. On the 18th December, Robert Cole, of Luton, was fined 901. for a similar offence. At Richmond 12 offenders in poor districts were fined in sums varying from 10L to 40s for selling flour at prices in excess of the maxima. The overcharge was a farthing in almost all cases, on quarterns and half-quarterns.At Grimsby, the Quaker Oats Company were fined 35L for selling goods under a false description.At Swansea, the Cwmbwria Co-operative Society, its manager and an assistant, were fined respectively 1001.. 41., and 30s. for imposing a condition on the sale of groceries. The Society had wished to bring about equitable distribution between members and non-members, and had chosen the method of refusing to supply customers who did not come with sugar cards.At Gloucester, a lady was fined 51. for burning a quantity of stale bread on her lawn. The defence was that she had acted under provocation by her husband from wdiom she is separated.At Stratford, John Sainsbury, provision dealer, was summoned for the offence of a manager in High Road, Ilford, in covering a price list with a sheet of blank rjaper, and was fined 50Z.The Mayor of Stafford, was fined 251. with 11 guineas costs in respect of an overcharge for tea by one of his shop assistants, who had sold it at 5s. 4*2. per lb.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.While there are no striking changes shown by the Tables there are certain features which call for notice : 1. The number of animals slaughtered does not appear to be increasing. This is borne out by the numbers sold at the markets, though, for reasons given in . other paragraphs, this particular table is a less trustworthy guide.2. The consumption of bread and flour remains steady, whereas last year (1916) there was a rise of 3\ per cent, in the four weeks&apos; period ending in December over that ending in November.A 3
3. Imports, though still on a low level, are slightly higher than the previous week.   The wheat stocks, including the stock on farms, have now fallen to 20   weeks&apos;   provision,   as  compared with the   27T  weeks   shown on &apos;  September 1st.Imports.Imports have recovered to some extent from the very low record of the first week in December, and the aggregate for principal foods last week was 141,000 tons, which is nearfy the same as the average for November.56,000 tons of wheat were imported last week, an improvement of 10 per cent, on the week before. Imports of barley and oats were nearly the same as in the previous week, but maize was 3,500 tons down. No rice was received last week, and little the week before, but till recently the imports have been on a large scale and the stock is high.The main cause of the increase in imports this week is the receipt of large consignments of meat, bacon, and hams. Of beef, mutton, and unspecified meat, .19,700 tons arrived as compared with 4,000 tons the week before, and of bacon and hams 8,600 tons as compared with 4,300 tons.The imports of margarine and butter have fluctuated considerably as shown in the following table. The average of the two together has been 3,600 tons weekly this year, as compared with 4,700 tons last year.(Tons.)1917.   Weekending	Nov. 3.	Nov. 10.	Nov. 17.	Nov. 21.	Dec. 1.	Dec. 8.

The supply of home-fed meat entering four principal markets (Table B) in the week ending December 8th was JO per cent, lower than in the previous week and 17 per cent, lower than in the corresponding week last year.The supply of fat cattle at 59 markets in Great Britain rose in the week ending December 12th to the level of the latter part of November, but was 151- Per cent, less than in the corresponding week last year.The supply of fat sheep wras larger than it has been since the first week in November, and 10 per cent, more than in the corresponding week last year. It may be deduced from Tables F and H that the wholesale and retail prices of British mutton have risen less since July 1914, and fallen more since August 1917, than the prices of British beef, no doubt as a result of the more plentiful supplies of the former.The supply of fat pigs was 2 per cent, greater than in the previous week.The preliminary returns for November of the number of animals slaughtered in England and Wales (Table D) shows a very slight increase of cattle and sheep over the returns for October 1917 and a considerable decrease in the number of calves, lambs, and pigs. The numbers of. calves and lambs slaughtered are still, however, nearly 30 per cent, above the numbers last year.The slaughter-house returns for England and Wales show a greater increase when 1917 is compared with 1916. both for cattle and for sheep, than do the market returns for Great Britain (Table B), and they also show a rise from September to December this year while the market returns indicate a slight fall. This divergence is due partly to the non-inclusion of Scotland in the table of numbers slaughtered and partly to the increase in private sales. Index-numbers for Scotland are shown separately in Table D ; their combination, which owing to differences in the method of enumeration cannot be complete, with the numbers for England and Wales, brings the movements more in harmony with those of animals sold at the markets (Table C).
Bread and Flour-The bakers&apos; and retailers&apos; returns of flour used or sold in the four weeks November 11th to December 8th show that the consumption both of bread and flour was almost identical with that of the previous four weeks (Table E). Last year the consumption increased 3^ per cent, in the same period.&quot;&apos;Consumption of Bread and of Flour expressed as Percentages of the Level of May, 1917.	Used in Bread.		Sold as Flour.

The consumption of flour is dominated by purchases for home-baking in the Northern Counties of England, and it is probably that the figures are greatly influenced by the variation of stocks held at home.   -The satisfactory feature of the figures is that there has been no rise in con-sumption either of bread or flour in the last periods of this year, whereas last year bread increased 1 per cent, and flour 10 per cent. The aggregate consumption in the most recent four weeks was less than last year, while in the two previous periods it was greater than last year.Bakers&apos; and retailers&apos; stocks were slightly lower on December 8th than on November 10th, 1917.
