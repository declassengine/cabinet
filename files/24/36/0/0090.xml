DESPATCH No. 12.From: General Fairholme, Military Attache, Athens.Subject : organization and equipment of the greek army.british legation,athens,my lord, 10th november, 1917.in my despatch no. 10, secret, dated 5th october, 1917, i had the honour to furnish to mr. crackanthorpe a detailed account of the scheme drawn up by the french general staff for the preparation of the Greek army to participate in the allied military operations on the salonika front.this project contemplated the placing in the field by february next of six greek divisions, complete in eveiy respect, in addition to the three divisions of the late provisional government army, which, although actually mobilized, are still deficient in artillery and other indispensable accessories.its full execution depended, however, on the necessary material, equipment and animals being furnished from france and england at an early date.now that it has apparently been decided in paris and london that practically nothing can be supplied for the greek army before january, the execution of the french scheme as described in my despatch has become impossible.general braquet has, however, submitted to the french general staff modified proposals according to which a few divisions (probably three) could be successively got ready and despatched to the front, by utilizing existing material and equipment so far as they will go, and by local partial mobilizations in certain restricted areas, possibly supplemented by volunteering.he would begin by putting one division on a War footing at larissa, utilising in this case only men of the 1915, 1916 and 1917 classes, which are already with the colours. deficient material, equipment aad animals would also be drawn from other units, whose turn would come later.a second division might be started at volo in the first instance, and a third at patras or athens, the men with the colours being supplemented by the local mobilisa-tion of a few classes of reservists; these divisions to be passed successively towards the front for completion when the first has left larissa for salonika, and so on.an alternative proposal is to mobilise for the moment infantry units only, which could be made use of to reinforce the allied armies at salonika pending the arrival of the war material on which the formation of complete greek divisions depends.i understand that the employment of volunteers during this preliminary period is also under consideration.general braquet believes that, apart from other causes of delay, reservists would require two months before they could be got physically fit for active service, owing to the insufficient nourishment from which the lower classes in this country have so long been suffering.no reply has as yet reached athens from paris, but it would certainly seem very desirable that a beginning should be made as soon as possible, not only in order to reinforce the salonika front, but also to strengthen the position of the venizelist government, for whom it is of vital importance to be able to show tangible results.if for this latter reason alone it would seem expedient to stretch a point in the matter of equipping the greek army at the earliest possible date.Internal conditions. the mass of the people, preoccupied by the food question and suffering from privations which at times have in some regions verged on famine, are evidently without enthusiasm for the war, and regard with dread the prospect of a fresh mobilization, but they are docile and submissive to authority and the reservists would probably respond in satisfactory numbers, as was the case recently with the 1916 and 1917 recruit contingents, which exceeded expectations by some 18 per cent.(b17/739)   30   12/17   h&amp;s   6388-wo
On the other hand there are not wanting, both in the army and nation, dangerous elements, hostile to the present regime, which work actively against mobilization. They are seeking to exploit the Eussian and Italian setbacks, and, no doubt, will fasten on our failure to equip the Greek Army as a pretext for inaction.Amongst the men of the upper classes, of military age there is at present no indication of the slightest keenness to fight. The subject of the war appears to arouse little interest and. is -seldom alluded to. Nor is the tone of the Press such as one would expect to find in a country on the eve of war against its hereditary enemy.Royalists-The partisans of the late King keep aloof and show no signs of a reconciliation with the present regime. They still hope for the victorious advance of a German Army to Salonika and Athens. There is reason to believe that they are in regular communication with les exiles, and a Cabinet Minister informed me a few days ago that the Italian Minister at Athens is known to be helping them, in pursuance of his policy of preventing Greece becoming strong and united.The best means of putting an end to this unsatisfactory situation would appear to be an early mobilization, so as to create a fait accompli since the army, once in the field, might be expected soon to assimilate the atmosphere of the Allied Armies.Attitude of Greek Staff Officers. General Braquet complains that he is meeting with considerable obstruction in his task of preparing the army for war. He finds the Greek officers with whom he is in contact both ignorant and pretentious, and they are utterly wanting in organizing capacity.In particular General Charalambis, the Chief of the General Staff, appears to be a stumbling block. He is an officer of very limited intelligence, but having been at one time Minister of War, resents having to carry out General Braquet&apos;s instructions. The latter tells me that their relations are strained, and he thinks that matters must -come to a head between them before long.Instruction of officers. The instruction of the first batch of some four hundred Greek officers of all ranks and arms is being conducted with the greatest zeal by the highly qualified instructors of the French Mission. I have attended several of the lectures, and I gathered the impression that the teaching is apt to be rather over the heads of the audience. General Braquet admitted this, but said that all he could hope was that of the seed sown broadcast some would fall on fertile ground.The attitude of the Greek officers towards the Mission appears to be on the whole satisfactory. A Greek colonel of artillery, who is considered to be one of their best, told a Greek friend of mine that he and his brother officers felt towards their French instructors like school boys in the presence of academicians.In a month&apos;s time, when the present batches have been instructed, it is proposed to form small centres of instruction for infantry and artillery at Patras and Volo.There are also to be further courses at Athens similar to the present ones.To sum up, I am of opinion that the Greek Army, in spite of its defects, might, under the auspices of the French Mission, be made capable of rendering us substantial aid on the Salonika front, but that it is highly desirable that it should be given the material means of taking the field at the earliest possible moment.I have the honour to be,Mv Lord, Your Lordship&apos;s obedient Servant,W. E. FAIRHOLME, Brigadier General, Military Attache.
