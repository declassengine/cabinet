. -.A .*h* pfooerty ofHis Britannic W*2J  L-I V0 3E C 3 B TWAR CABINET., -   SITUATION IN RUSSIA. (Note by Sir 3j Carson;) iI think my colleagues&apos; should see the enclosed Memorandum which has been given to the Director of Information by Mr.Arndtt, the Director of-the -Yauxliall Motors Limitedf resident in PetrogradHe landed in this country four Slays ago.   This1 is a further communication in addition to the copy of Trotskyfs Manifesto which I read out.at tho Gabinot on December 19th.flntd.)   3.C.2, Whitehall hardens, S-.7. December 20th, 1917...****&quot;**********COPY OP LETTER FROM MR. F.- ARNOTT TO THE DIRECTOR&apos;^ IIJFOIMATION.180, Croat Portland Street, London, Vf. December 19th, 1917.Colonel Buchan,Foreign Office,Downing Street,: 3.w&quot;.COIW 13)3 N TIAI-. .Dear Col. Buchan,I took the opportunity, whilst waiting at the Bolshevik Headquarters on November 16th for&apos;a travelling permit during the Finnish general strike, of asking Lenin and Trotsky for a statement of their aims.   Lenin, a very benevolent looking fellow with a most kindly,, gentle manner, smilingly denied sufficient knowledge of English for a political conversation and referred me- to Trotsky.   Trotsky, who exactly resembles Svengali but is built on meaner lines, a repulsive man,   apparently without sympathy cr pity in his makeup tnd- whose honesty I would doubt, but unmistakably very sharpwitted and clever, after twice curtly refusing to talk,, finally ?- . eed. to write out and sign a statement,-    I gave you &amp; translation of this statement this morning.
1 did this chic flfr bwuso In Petrogrud tho only vi-w I iv* hoartf nxprocscd -as that thie Bolshevik movement was an tttv.tr of hooligans which --lould die out in a few Says, and I 1 believed this to &quot;bo an entirely wrong view, and I think far moro strongly now that ,sueh a view, if persisted in, will load to the almost complete squeezing out of the Allies from the Hussion-market to the advantage of Germany..    As the Director of a firm &quot;that has comparatively largo interests in Russia,, this is for mo a matter of tho utmost seriousness,, hence ny desire, to investigate, the actual state of affairs.At the date mentioned the Press Correspondents in Petrograd held the general view of the Bolshevik which has been stated above v,I believe that not less than 90$ of the Russian people      &apos; are inclinoe to favour the Bolshevik aims - perhaps not in the extreme Trotsky form but In a form which&apos; includes the moro important parts, of the Trotsky programme, namely,, land settle-mont and peace.Incidentally, when I saw Lenin-&amp; Trotsky, I pointed out very clearly that a considerable part of the Socialistic Press,.although favouring the Bolshevik: pro gramme^, wore violently opposed to Lenin &amp; Trotsky personallyr. and I asked them both separately and. very clearly whether they would stand down if it became necessary for the sake of unityv Lenin said &quot;my personal feelings count for nothing - if it is for the- good of Russia that I. should stop down I will ow. no account take- part in the Govern-ment,r   Trotsky answered the same question nwhy sure,, how could&quot; anyone doubt it?&quot;&quot;I think it would be well: to publish this in England as it would.he repeated in Russia, and might possibly act as a laver- to help along the withdrawal of Trotsky and thus make possible the formation, o-f a strong united Bolshevik Socialist Government which I believe would he very good for the country. -since there is ne liklihood that the odd 10$ who favour the Cadet party aims can hope for many years at losst-to rule the remaining nine-tenths against the wishes&apos;of that majority.I had an intsresting talk with Mr.. Shatoff; one of tho chief men below Lenin &amp; Trotsky - a man who had spent some twelve years in America.,    I&apos;suggested that&apos;the Bolshevik move--ment was tainted with German-money,, ana although ho denied that he personally,knew of the acceptance of German funds, he said that the Bolshevik principle.would&apos;be that if the Germans were foolish enough to provide money for propaganda which the Bolshevik believed to.be good for Russia,: they would certainly take that money,, particularly as the^ Bolshevik to a man are convinced that it is only a matter of time- before - the German army is saturated with democratic ideas sufficiently to cause trouble to their GovernmentA thing, that distresses me more than anything I know is:the absence of; any. effective British propaganda in Russia, I tackled Mr.-.-. Shato/ff on, the subject of the thousands of German-agitators-working., under-Bolshevik cover, and he said that
Britain was entirely to blame for the success of this propa-ganda.   He reminded me of what I already knew, that the -Russian mentality cannot grasp the possibility of this war being con-tinued for altruistic -motives, and that the mere claim of altruistic aims causes a Russian to think that the.claim is made only to hid3 the real motive.These German agitators make, and have been persistently ramming home time after time, tho most fantastic claims as to Britain1s war aims, including such things as the claim that Britain has forced France -to agree to a cession of that territory which forms the coast line of the narrow part of the Channel, and in return France is to have a large slice of Germany.   They point to British advances in Palestine and Mesopotamia and the seizure of the German-colonies, and the Russian mentality is such that he cannot, think that these things are done for anything else but ordinary gain, and if the old-time admiration for British business institutions causes a Russian &quot;to waver in believing these fantastic stories, the German agitator presses the point &quot;Ifnny statements are not true how do you account for the silence of Britain as. to her . war aims?&quot;     Personally, I think it is only the old respect for British business institutions, which in the South of Russia amounts almost to worship, but prevents the Russian from putting us in quite the same category as Roumania and Italy, who have not, so far as my experiences go, a friend&quot; in Russia oven amongst important business circles.From my knowledge of the Russian character-, I think that any attempt to combat German propaganda without concrete statements as to our own war aims is not only doomed to failure but might even do us more harm&apos;, and by serious propaganda,-I mean propaganda which would be done by men&quot; numbering not&apos;dozens or hundreds but thousands - and this is the scale which must be thought of if it is t.o:be a.&apos;serious propaganda to compete with the German,,   . - -.    Influential Russians that I know - doubtless influenced -by events in Russia - take the view that a general&apos; peace is much nearer than one might imagine from reading&apos; the British   x papers, and seme of them have, quite recently expressed to me the fear that Germany will very soon maku a peace offer which, by giving way to cur demands as regards Belgium,&apos; will be so attractive to the British masses that no Government dare refuse them;    these Russians regard such a thing as a calamity, since &apos; it. would be&apos;a peace at the suggestion of Germany,, and-many have asked me why England does not state clearly on what terms she will make peace, they being convinced that:the same thing would happen b vtween the Gorman people and Government as they foar will happen in England,Nearly all. of the more influential Russian business men I know believe that the publication of Britain1s peace terms would cause a clamour for peace in Germany, and they think it is only the terms of Italy, and possibly France that make publication-difficult; - they all&quot;look upon England quite differently to Franco - England is regarded as a great, sol^c powerful mother - the embodiment of common-sense, and they think that this England should bo strong enough to put aside other peopleTs ambitions and make a statement now. which will cut the ground from under the expected Gorman peace move.%
If I were asked to say -what is the chief difference in the character of the Russian and the English that I have noticed during my stay^ in Russia, I should say that it lies in the attitude of one man to another, in that in Russia.no man trusts another.   Such a thing as a verbally arranged ,;deal&quot; is absolutely unknown, and when Russians make contracts they do not attempt to carry out the spirit of the contract, but always examine it most carefully for flaws which enable them to get the better of the other party, knowing that the other party is doing exactly the same.    This is the spirit in which all con-tracts are regarded..   The Russian believes there may be a hidden motive in everything that is done,  and that is why no form of war aim statement will appeal to the mass of Russians,  except a statement in the most concrete form,   so unambiguous that even the German agitators cannot twist its meaning.In stating this I realise fully the difficulties,  and no one is more sorry than I am that the Russian situation happens to be such that the British Government,  if it intends, to retain some footing in the Russian market,  is placed in the almost impossible position of having to state concrete war aims. As I said at first, however, the retention of the Russian market is a vital matter for my Company,  and that must be my excuse for giving you quite frankly my impressions of the situation in Russia.Yours truly,(Sgd.)    V, ARNOTT.(Director of VAUXHALL MOTORS, LIMITED. Resident in Petrograd.)
