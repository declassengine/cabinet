CRW/032. 1&apos;0  I   0* : *)co 11 WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   RUSSIA.   XXXII.(18 December, 1917).There are now 6 distinct Governments in what was till recently the Russian Republic:-   (1) The Bolshevik Government controlling roughly Northern and Contral Russia.    (2) Finland.    (3)   Ukraina. (4) The Cossack Federation.   (5) The Caucasus.   (6) Siberia. Lesser units such as Esthonia, Crimea etc. need not be considered for the present.   In the same way Finland may be excluded from any consideration of the general situation in Russia.   The Finns have broken away entirely from Russia, claiming independence not federation;   the Finnish question is quite distinct from those of Ukraina, Siberia etc., as these countries are far more closely linked with Russia both by raoe and history.(1) Northern and Central Russia.For the moment Northern and Central Russia is the most disorganised and distracted part of Russia.   Food conditions are worse and class differences more acute than elsewhere.   In all the principal towns the Bolsheviks are In the ascendancy, and for the present their influence over the ssldiers both in the garrisons and at the front is supreme.     It is only in the country districts that they are in a minority;   here, in spite of their land legislation, the peasants continue to support the more moderate Social Revolutionaries against them.The two chief subjects of interest in Petrograd are (1) The Constituent Assembly. and (2) The Negotiations with Germany.The present overbearing attitude of the Bolsheviks towards the Constituent Assembly was only to be expected, and there seems not the
slightest doubttthat opposition on the part of the moderates will merely lead to still greater violence and a reign of terror in which death may take the place of imprisonment.   On the other hand there is probably no mob less capable of maintaining a reign of terror than the Russian;   it may be guilty of the most terrible acts of barbarity in the heat of the moment, but its feeling of hatred and anger soon disappears, and in moat cases it will not do what is expected of it In the West.   Thus it need not be taken for granted that a reign of terror established by the Bolsheviks will very soon be followed by a violent reaction.   Last September, when Kerenski and Kornilov were threatening and denouncing one another, and when civil war on a large scale seemed inevitable, the whole affair ended in the fraternising of the opposing forces. In the same way it is possible that the Russian peasants and workmen will soon grow weary of the Bolsheviks&apos; reign of terror, and will demand some form of compromise.   This would mean getting rid of the most uncompromising of the Bolshevik leaders, Lenin especially, and forming a Coalition of Bolsheviks and Social Revolutionaries.Like all Slav countries Russia suffers from innumerable party groupings, and nowhere is this more noticeable than among the Socialists.   These groupings among the Socialists are partly due to differences of programme, partly to differences of tactics.   In times of revolution it is the latter difference   whioh counts most, and we may make the main divisions on that basis.   There are now four main divisions:-   (1) The Right or Moderate Socialists, including Plekhanov, Kerenski, Avksentyev and perhaps Tsereteli. (2) The Centre, including Chernov, Dan, Gotz etc.    (3) The Left, including Martov (Menshevik Internationalists), the Left Social Revolutionaries and the moderate Bolsheviks.   (4) The Leninites.In a Socialist Coalition it is unlikely that either the Right
or the extreme-Left would be included;   the Right because they are too closely associated with the bourgeoisie, and the extreme Left because Lenin and his closest followers are absolutely uncompromising. Lenin himself realises that he can only maintain his position during what he describes as the period of transition   from war to peace. Once peace comes he recognises that Russia must return to parliamentary Government, but meanwhile his intention Is to force peace and social revolution by revolutionary methods.The negotiations with Germany have been resumed during the last few days.   The first stage has been the formal conclusion of an armistice from December 17 to January 14, 1918.     Prom to-day, therefore, negotiations for a general peace will begin.      The basis of these negotiations as put forward by Trotski are:-(1) No annexations.   (2) Self-determination of all peoples by means of a referendum.   Such self-determination is to be applied in the fullest sense of the word, but no distinction apparently is made between European and civilised peoples, Asiatic and semi-civilised peoples and African and uncivilised peoples.(2) Ukraina.The Government of Ukraina appears to be safely in the hands of the Rada or National Council, with the General Secretariat as the Cabinet.   For some days after the Bolshevik rising in Petrograd * the position of the Rada was disputed by representatives of the late Provisional Government, who brought troops from the front, and with the help of Junkers (O.T.C.) and Cossacks tried to get control of Kiev.   When the troops realised that it was the Rada, and not the Bolsheviks, that they were opposed to, they refused to fight, and, after negotiating with the Rada Government, they left Kiev.
The Ukrainian Government is a Bourgeois-Socialist Coalition, hut more Socialist than Bourgeois in spite of the denunciations of the Bolsheviks in Petrograd.   The Prime Minister and Minister of the Interiori Vinnlchenko, is a Socialist, hut more of the type of Kerenski than Tsereteli, i.e. he is a sympathiser with rather than a full member of the Socialist party.   He can, therefore, be relied upon to make concessions to the workmen and peasants without being doctrinaire in his Socialism.   His main interest is national rather than Socialist;   the object of his social reforms being to gain support for his political claims to independence.The policy of the Ukrainian Government was announced on November 21 in the ^Universal&quot; or General Proclamation published by the General Secretariat.   Its chief points were as follows:-(1) The Ukrainian Republic is to be independent, but in federation with the Russian Republic.   (2) The Land is to be given to the peasants.    (3) Labour control over industry and an 8 hours&apos; day. (4) An Ukrainian Constituent Assembly to be summoned in January.So far no claim has been made to complete independence, but there is reason to think that the Ukrainian leaders are merely waiting for a suitable moment to profit by Russia&apos;s weakness and make wider claims.   If we may hazard a guess, their object is to sound the Allies as to recognition of their independence on the ground that they are the only organised force in Russia that can resist the Germans.   They maintain that they are rapidly restoring order and forming a new Ukrainian army, but that meanwhile they must take up a very reserved attitude for fear of an attack by the Germans, who cast longing eyes on their food supplies.Such assurances at the present moment can hardly be accepted at their face value.   In the first place the influence of the Rada over the Ukrainian people is not established on very firm
18.12.17.foundations, their territorial claims in Russia are disputed, and the success of their nationalist propaganda in the eastern districts that they claim Is still most uncertain.    It is not impossible that there may be an anti-nationalist reaction headed by the Sovyets in many of the towns the Rada claims as supporting its programme. In the second place there is always a danger that any recognition on the part of the Allies might be used by the Ukrainians simply to get better terms out of the Germans, while the Germans on their part might use it in order to complicate still further the relations between Britain and Russia.(3) The Cossack Federation.This federation extends from the Don to the Caucasus on the south east and to the .Urals on the north east.     The head-quarters of the movement are at Novocherkassk, where Kaledin is in command, and at Orenburg which is under the control of Dutov, There is a very close understanding between the two.   Kaledin is being backed by Russian politicians and generals in the hope that he may put himself at the head of an anti-Socialist movement through out Russia,   There is no immediate prospect of this.   Kaledin-has his own hands far too full in the south to venture northwards, Rostov and the Donets Basin are both disputed areas.   There are 3 rival claimants there - the Sovyets, the Ukrainians and the Cossacks.   So far the Ukrainians have kept in the background, letting the Cossacks fight it out with the Sovyets, but they have included both districts in the future territory of the Ukrainian Republic.   Events in the south of Russia where the Cossacks are fighting are of a local rather than a general interest.(4)   There is no special news either from Siberia or the Caucasus.
