G.T. 3097.

Report of Sub-Committee of Committee appointed by War Cabinet 304. Minute 2.

The Sub-Committee appointed by the Committee set up by the War Cabinet, Under 304, Minute 2, which is charged with the settlement of the 12½% advance, report as follows:-

1. They present a suggested formula for incorporation in a general statement of the Government.

2. To explanation of the formula they desire to point out that it has three principles:-

(a) It guarantees piece workmen at least the same earnings as those of the time workmen after adding 12½%.

(b) It sets out that future advances are matters for the Committee on Production.

(c) It urges payment by results, with a broad indication that to popularize the system, employers should consider revision.

3. They have considered further, the question of extension to further trades. They think that a definite announcement should be issued that no further 12½% Ordere will be made. In the case, however, of the Iron and Steel Industry, and of Aircraft Workers, the Committee feel that it is necessary to inform the employers and Trade Unions that conferences should be called to consider whether wage or other adjustments should be made to meet anomalies.

Agreements arrived at by the conferences should be submitted to the Ministry of Munitions for consideration.    If the Ministry of Munitions feel that any agreement reached requires further examination or if no agreement is reached, the matter should be referred to the Ministry of Labour for remission to the Committee on Production.


^ 4. Beyond those two trades they arc convinced that any further (vS extension noccs-sarily involve tiio entire abandonmont of limitsand the concession of a goneral advance&apos; to&apos;all trades not ncc-cssarily limitad to munitions trade3.5o The-Sub-Committee realise that proposals, thus limited,will be opposed by the men, and probably strongly opposed. Their belief, however,  is that if the announcement is coupled with a proclamation on a high plane,- with the fullest Cabinet authority, of the Gov-rinraent Labour policy as a whole, -it may possibly- succeed in solving the difficulty.failing this solution they think it waste of time to deal with.sectional difficulties, which are. innumerable and insoluble,  or ..to estimate tho further trades which.might be- included,-and&apos; the. cost of such inclusion,    Their firm belief is that the line now proposed combined with the Government- pronouncement of the type indicated is the only-position ce--tween cancellation of the grant &quot;and. the universal-&quot;advance b^sod on no consideration either of economy or grievance.Formula.1.      . A bonus of 12j[% - on. earnings has been given to time workmen &apos; employed .in Engineering Shops, Shipyards, Boiler-shops- and j?ound-- ries, in view, of the contrast between.the- earning power of time-workmen and pertain classes of pieceworkers In the industries concerned.20       The foregoing bonus- to time workmen h^s given rise to an inequality in the -case of those pioceworkmon and Others em-ployed ,on payment by results who are only able to earn amounts equal to, or, slightly in, excess of,  tho-s-e ;carned by time workmen to whom the bonus is payable/5-o        It has therefore boon decided that where in the foregoing trades the earnings of workmen employed on systems of payment by results ar \ lo 33--.-t.ha-n they would have&apos;,been -if calculated on the time basis for the hours worked plus .12-^.,. the workemn workmen shall be paid their earnings calculated on a time basis plus 12&quot;g-/o!t4,      The Government desire to point out that in the national interests it i   necessary that, payment by results should bo ex-tended a-3 much a3 possible.    They therefore desire to impress on both employers and workpeople the necessity of making imx-- tually satisfactory arrangements whyroby payment by-results may- not only.bo maintained, but&apos;extended.be      It ha7 also been decided that no further 0rd;-rs p;iving the 12j//j bonus shall be made, ana that all future general altera-tions in wages should be submitted to tho iani-stry of Labour for remission, to the Committee on--Pro duct ion, who will consider- all the. circumstances of particular trades, from- the standpoint-
of the mor:fepo opleand of the employers..    In this connection the Government will consider the reinfurcemenet of the panels1 of the Committee on Production. . - *.
