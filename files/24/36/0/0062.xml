A V   f[This Document ig the Property of His -Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET. G.T.-3062.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 19th December. 1917,Summary.Part I: General Remarks.Tbe difficulties and dangers connected with the conference on the recognition of Shop Stewards are discussed.Part II: Press Opinions.The Labour and Socialist press is summarised under the following heads: Shop Stewards, Lord Lansdowne&apos;s Letter, The Food Problem, The Censorship of Leaflets, State Control of Trade, and The Labour Party&apos;s Programme.Part III: District Reports.The situation is much quieter, though still serious on the Clyde. Developments in connection with the 12^ per cent, award are causing dissatisfaction among pieceworkers, particularly in the north-east.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving Stoppages. No serious strikes are -in progress. Furness Railway craftsmen and Bristol aircraft workers are back at work.(b.) Not Involving Stoppages. Disputes over the application of the 12^ per cent, advance and the question of rivetting rates on standard ships continue.I. General Remarks.The Conference on Recognition of Shop Stewards.No complete information has yet been received as to the result of the con-ference of the employers and the Trade Unions in the engineering industry on the subject of the recognition of the Shop Stewards, except that the conference has been postponed sine die without arriving at any definite conclusion. It appears, however, that differences which, threatened to be irreconcilable arose on several points, and finally the negotiations broke down because the employers would not concede the Trade Unions&apos; demand that the Shop Stewards should have a place of meeting in the works and be allowed to meet in working hours. It is now stated, however, that the conference is to reassemble on the 20th December. The difficulty which has always been foreseen is that the unions will be unable to agree among themselves as to a basis of representation on any central body that may be established and on their relations to each other in particular works. The craft unions are averse to their members being represented by Shop Stewards who belong to an unskilled union and vice versa. These difficulties represent feelings of rivalry and jealousy which are strong on the executives of the various unions., but which also exist to a large extent among the rank and file.[1100-9] B
On the other hand there is a distinct danger that if no agreement is reached among the unions the Shop Stewards may gather sufficient strength to attempt to force recognition of their National Committee, which would mean the breakdown of the present trade union system in the industry. The leaders of the movement are not likely to acquiesce without a struggle in being relegated from a position of national importance which they now hold to becoming a minor wheel in the Trade Union machinery. There is a good deal of activity among them both on the Clyde and at Barrow. They are still looking for some large question on which thjey can unite all the workers in the shops with a view to producing another strike, which would demonstrate their power, and at present it looks, from a speech which McManus delivered recently at Barrow, as if they thought that they had found a suitable grievance in the Food Question. He exhorted his audience not to get up deputations to the Government, but to wait until they could all act together nationally and force the issue. If, however, t^ie postponed conference succeeds in finding some plan which will give recognition to the Shop Stewards as a definite part of the trade union machinery, this will probably satisfy the reasonable element among the Shop Stewards, who are more concerned with the questions than with large schemes for obtaining the control of industry, &amp;c. This element is at present probably not a considerable majority, but if the conference fails to devise any scheme of recognition, they may be drawn into the arms of the extreme leaders.II. Press Opinions.General Summary,The Coventry affair has naturally attracted considerable attention. Most of the papers which support the war policy of the Government recommend that the position of the shop stewards should be recognised and legalised. &quot;Justice &quot; dis-sents from this view, holding that the movement is likely to break up the present system of Trade Unionism without giving any compensatory advantages. Other papers, however, adopt one of two attitudes, holding either that the present movement is due to the reaction of labour from political to industrial methods, or that the official sections among Trades Unionists are always liable to be led away by capitalists, and that a perennial cleansing of the old officialdom and its replacement by a new one more closely in touch with Labour is necessary.The more extreme section of the Labour press takes the opportunity to express a fear that an attempt will be made to secure acceptance of the recommendations of the Whitley Committee as one of the conditions on which the Shop Stewards movement will be recognised. The intlention would appear to be to discredit the Whitley Report and to deprive the Government of any commendation which might result from a national recognition of the movement.In connection with the Coventry affair, indignation has been expressed at the statement made by Mr. Kelleway in the House of Commons in regard to a leaflet prepared in the Ministry of Munitions and purporting to come from Germany. It is probably with the idea of playing on this feeling that the &quot; Nation &quot; publishes a copy of the leaflet.The Lansdowne Letter.The Lansdowne letter has continued to be a topic of general discussion. The strongly pro-war papers denounce Lord Lansdowne and his policy as being anti-democratic and in opposition to the policy of President Wilson. The &quot; Clarion &quot; claims that the President is completely discredited with the pacifists, and the &quot; British Citizen &quot; replies to Lord Lansdowne in a very trenchant statement of war aims.* The moderate and pacifist papers claim, however, that President Wilson andLord Lansdowne are in accord on the main points at issue, though Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; thinks that the Presidents speech had &quot; objectionable features.&quot; Their attitude on this subject is probably tendencious and should be read in connection with the project of displacing the present Government.
Little comment on Mr. Asquith&apos;s speech has been received, but the papers which support Lord Lansdowne find in it a certain measure of support. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; is of opinion :that it was too generous to Lord Lansdowne, while the &quot;British Citizen &quot; is obviously contemptuous and complains of talk and rhetoric.The Food Problem.The Food. Question is one which affords ground for attack to papers of all opinions. The comments of some of the more moderate of these are becoming virulent, and the &quot;Woolwich Pioneer &quot; -goes so far as to use the word revolution.The &quot; food queue &quot; is the chief topic of complaint at the moment, and this is no doubt partly due to the coldness of the weather during the past week. As there can be little hope of immediate improvement in climatic conditions, increasing complaint on this subject must be expected.Milk for the children and difficulties in connection with sugar cards come in for a good deal of criticism, while the pacifist &quot; Call&quot; heads its article &quot; Peace or Famine.&quot;&apos;The Censorship *ojf ^LecLftets.The Governments concession on this point has not been met with much enthusiasm, but the pacifist papers are obviously too nearly threatened to hold an unbiassed view. These papers regard the concession as &quot; sheer hypocrisy,&quot; and &quot;a worthless change,&quot; and there is some criticism of the Liberal Party as having queered the pitch of the Labour Party in its efforts against the censorship. They demand in the words of !the &quot;&quot;Call &quot; that a &quot;constant pressure &quot; should b)e kept up till the regulation is entirely withdrawn. It is -clear that the Labour Party hopes to detach a considerable section of the radical Liberal Party, which will then gravitate into its own sphere of influence.The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; however, thinks that the new censorship has lost &quot; its most grotesque features.&quot;State Control of Trade.The State Control of Trade is attracting considerable attention, and the criticism of -the new Commercial Intelligence Department, the Non-Ferreous Metals Bill, and other Governmental activities is decidedly adverse.The Labour Ptirty^s Programme.The new constitution of the Labour Party and the proposals which are to be put forward at the approaching conference are beginning to be discussed. &quot; Justice &quot; is somewhat opposed to inclusion of individuals, since they may be neither trades unionists or socialists perhaps this is a criticism of the efforts which are being made to detach ^individual members of the Liberal Party. The &quot;British Citizen &quot; is disposed very severely to criticise the present trend of policy within the Labour movement.Bbl. District Reports.London.Apart from the restlessness among -employees ib. the ^erqplane trade, this -district is &quot;quieter.The woodworkers at the Hendon Aircraft Manufacturing Gompany are expecting a rise of \\d., which will bring their pay up to Is. %\d. an hour. In addition, it is stated that they intend to demand a 5s. war bonus which was granted to the engineers, having obtained this they will then endeavour to obtain the 12^ per -cent, advance.South- Western.The situation.at -Bristol, wherefkp woodworkers at six aeroplane wo^ks recently struck work, has been-somewhat serious-(see Section TV). Otherwise the position is normal. .[1100-9] B 2
West Midlands.It is reported that Mr. Asquith&apos;s speech at Birmingham, has given great satisfaction to the workers of that district. His remarks on reconstruction were particularly noted by the audience.Employees at the Austin Motor Works, Birmingham, are asking for the aboli-tion of the&apos;war bonus system, and its conversion into an increase of wages.Coventry is quiet. The operatives, however, affiliated to the Coventry Building Trades&apos; Federation, are stated to be about to demand a substantial increase in wages.Reports show that in spite of the fact that there was considerable opposition to Miss Christabel Pankhursfs recent speech in the town on industrial unrest, anumber of Trade Unionists have said that had they heard her speech during the recent strike they would have returned to work in spite of the Shop Stewards. Older Trade Unionists do not appear to be altogether in favour of Shop Stewards movement.Yorkshire and East Midlands.This area is decidedly quieter, and it is reported that local Trade Union leaders, more especially around Leeds, are very satisfied with proposed recognition of the Shop Stewards. It is believed that such recognition will make for stability amongst the rank and file, and neutralise the activities of those who favour the extremists.North-Western.The situation in this area, now that the craftsmen on the Furness Railway have returned to work, is quiet.North-East em.There appears to be considerable unrest amongst moulders in the Newcastle district. The men on piece work assert that in March 1916, the time workers received an award of 3s. per week, which was not paid to piece workers, and with the addition of 12^ per cent, it is giving the time workers a considerable advantage over the piece workers. A great many moulders have already ceased piece work, and each day that number is increasing, and the dissatisfaction is spreading.At a mass meeting convened by the Shop Stewards of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders, Newcastle, to discuss the recent ballot and resolution from the committee, with regard to further action, it was announced that the result of the ballot was 20 to 1 for ceasing piece work, unless the 12^ per cent, was granted to the piece workers. It was decided that notices would he handed in on the 24th instant, if their demands were not conceded. The local opinion is that the piece workers have a genuine grievance.South Wales.There is great unrest among the railway shopmen in Cardiff. The grievance of the Taff Vale railway shopmen being the same as that which brought them.out on strike on the 3rd instant that the traffic men have been awarded 6s. per week war bonus, while the shopmen only received 5s. It will be remembered that on the 4th instant these men resumed work upon an undertaking given by Mr. Prosser, the managing director of the Cardiff Railways to take steps to secure them the same consideration as the traffic men. It is feared that if the demands of these men are not met they will cease work.Scotland.On the Clyde, the labour situation is still serious. For some time past there has been much dissatisfaction amongst the employees at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s munition factory, Paisley, and, with reference to this a special meeting of Shop Stewards in the Beardmore Combine was recently held at Glasgow. It was stated that the victimisation of four women had led to the closing of the shop in East Hope Street. Although this shop had been ostensibly closed in order to get rid of undesirables to
IV. Disputes. * (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.In view of the continued industrial unrest on the&apos; Clyde, the strike of 1,800 employees at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s munition factory, Paisley, may be accounted the most serious dispute of the week. The cause of the strike is the reduction by the firm of a bonus which was paid on output. Although it is believed that an early settlement will be arrived at, it should be noted that there have been a number of disputes in connection with factories in Glasgow and Paisley. At the present time there is much unrest over alleged victimisation at this firm&apos;s shops at Glasgow^ So high does the feeling run concerning a number of cases of alleged wrongful dismissal that a very serious strike may be precipitated shortly.The Furness Railway craftsmen who recently struck work for the payment of the district rate for skilled fitters and turners, resumed work on the 14th instant on the understanding that negotiations should at once be commenced, with a view to their demands being granted.A serious strike, involving 3,000 woodworkers, occurred in six of the Bristol Aeroplane Manufactories, The operatives demand the increased percentage on wages which the mechanics have been given. After having remained out five days they resumed work on the 17th.Only two fresh cases of strike this week are reported by the Ministry of Munitions, in both of which settlement has been reached.xibout 120 men and women employed by Messrs. James Bartle and Company (Netting Hill) struck in protest against the indecorous language and domineering mariner of a fore-man.   The case was investigated and the offender dismissed.The War Office Contracts Department report two new disputes involving stoppage of work which have not been settled.An important strike has occurred among the employees of Messrs. Eastwood Brothers,. Peckett Well Mills, where blouses are machined for West African troops. The United Garment Workers&apos; Union demanded an increased price for machining, and whilst negotia-tions were in progress between the Union and the employers the operatives struck work. A circular was issued by the Union to which the firm has taken exception, and for which it demands an apology. This the Union has refused, and although an agreement as to iucreased wages has been reached, matters are at a deadlock.No new cases of strike are reported this week by the Coal Controller. The strike at the small colliery in Scotland, over a wage question, reported last week, is the only outstanding stoppage.The Shipyard Labour Department reports seven new cases of strike, five of which are in the Glasgow area.None of the above-mentioned stoppages are of outstanding importance, and the strikers involved are by no means numerous.the best interests of the firm, sixty new women were reported to have been taken on, whilst there were at least 120 of the old hands still idle. It is reported that the whole of the howitzer shop have decided to support the women and also one A.S.E. member and one toolmaker, who are alleged to have been victimised.There are indications that the C.W.C. is short of funds, and although the membership is increasing the old Trade Unionists are a formidable barrier to the success of the committee.At a recent meeting of the Scottish Mine Workers&apos; Union, Glasgow^ Mr. Eobert Smillie presiding it was agreed to protest against the regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act dealing with the curtailment of the right of issuing leaflets till they were first uermitted by th.6 Censor: A resolution was forwarded to the secretary of the Miners&apos;&quot; Federation of Great Britain with a view to obtaining their assistance in trying to secure the withdrawal of the regulation.Ireland.It would appear that the food problem is becoming serious in Ireland, and the serious strikes reported in various districts are largely due to this.   In fact it isevident that industrial unrest in Ireland has increased considerably during the last few months.
As has been previously reported there is considerable unrest amongst- the rivetters, and a number of men employed on rivetting by Simons and Co., Renfrew, ceased work,, apparently in sympathy with the employees at the Fair/!eld Shipbuilding and Engineering Company&apos;s works. It will be remembered that on the 8th instant 400 riveiters of the Fairfield Works ceased work and refused to return until the Committee on Production announced their decision regarding the rivetting rates.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.There is considerable satisfaction amongst workers in the Manchester area over the settlement of the cotton disputes.The spinners had asked for an advance of 32 per cent., the card out blowing room operatives for 25 per cent., and the operatives in the manufacturing section 40 per cent. Under the settlement, an all-round immediate advance of 15 per cent, is conceded.Operatives have agreed to accept 15 per cent, on the employers agreeing to con-tinue the payment of levies under the Control Boards Scheme of restricted production, so that a fund may be created from which out-of-work employees can be maintained.The Ministry of Munitions report ten cases of dispute, two of which have beensettled. Another dispute, which, however, was satisfactorily settled arose over the 12-1 per cent, bonus of Glasgow.The Mirelees Watson Company, Limited, pay a bonus of 2 per cent, on the monthly output to all time-workers. The question arose: did this bonus exclude skilled engineers from the benefits of the 12-^,- per cent, award? The Wages Section decided that it did; and after some negotiation this decision was accepted, and notices which had been given were withdrawn.There is only one fresh case of dispute reported by the Coal Controller; this has arisen between the clerks and employers of the the Fife Coal Company.Three new cases of dispute are reported by the War Office Contract Department.It is stated that in the&apos; leather trade and in the woodworking trades a considerable number of complaints have been received from War Office contractors that the high wages paid in the new aeroplane factories1 axe having a disturbing influence on their workpeople. This is especially apparent among female leather-workers, whose work is wet and disagree-able, particularly in the cold weather.In addition to 130 outstanding cases of dispute not involving stoppage of work,thirty-one fresh disputes are reported by the Shipyard Labour Department. In forty-six additional cases settlements have been effected.As shown in Section III (North-Eastem Area) there is growing dissatisfaction amongst the pieceworkers, who consider that as the time-workers receive the per cent, they should receive the same concession.It is stated that turners employed by Messrs. Armstrong Whit-worth and Companv refuse to work piece-work in conseqence of the payment of the 12J per cent, advanee^to time-workers and not to piece-workers. The firm has been informed that the matter ia having the attention of the Labour Committee, and endeavours are being made to prevail on the men to remain on piece work.The rivetters complain of the delay which is taking place in settling their price lists for ordinary merchant and standard vessels. They are asking for the Clyde List plus 80 per cent, plus 1\ per cent, for standard vessels. They threaten to strike unless a settlement is arrived at quickly.The Chief Industrial Commissioners Department have about a hundred new differences to report for the week ending the 15th December.It is stated that the number of differences is rather less than in the preceding week.In the Engineering Section attention may be called to the claim of the National Union of Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers to the Scottish Association of Master Heat-ing, Ventilating, and Domestic-Engineers, for the payment of similar advances to those recently awarded by the-Committee on Production to the engineering and foundry trades.It is reported that steps are being taken with a view to arranging a conference repre-senting the various Master Carters&apos; Association and the Transport Workers&apos; Federation with a view to securing uniformity of the war advances in the carting trade.
