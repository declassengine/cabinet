MEMORANDUM as to Proposed Removal of the Staff of H.M. Office of Woods and Forests from Whitehall&apos;to the Natural History Museum, South Kensington,, as proposed in Sir A. Durrant&apos;s letter of 11th December, 1917.A somewhat similar proposal was made in November 1015, and Lord Selborne and Mr. Leveson Gower then wrote a letter to the First Commissioner of Works,, datod 25th November, 1915, from which the following is an extract:-&quot;We&apos; wish to point out that the difficulties connected with the proposal that tho Office of Woods staff should quit the present premises and remain away during tho War arc very great.   &apos;&quot;To be   n with tho Office of V/oo^s is closely . allied with the Board of Agriculture, the President of the Board being ex offioio a Commissioner of Woods, and some officers do work for both Departme1-Bo include Messrs, barter Jonos &amp; Sonsdossrs,Glutton,- both whom act as Crown eivers, &amp; Mr. JohnA good deal of the correspondenoo which is carried on relates to leases of property granted many years ago, and constant reference to loasos, plans, conveyances, etc., is necessary.    In this rospeot tho correspondence of this Office is very different to that of many other offices,, whore it is seldom necessary to refer back to old documents or correspondence which passed many years ago.   The Office of Woods has a great quantity of title doeds ard estate maps and papers stored in fire-proof rooms in the basement.    It would be impracticable tc remove these temporarily, and they would often need to be referred to b.y the staff.    The principal professional advisers of the Department are also looated close at   hand, and much business is donerray, who advises &amp; otiates as to leaSos*.with them by moans of personal interviews.

We think that you. will see from the above that -the difficulties which would attach to a move of any Government Department are probably greater as regards the Office of Woods than would be the case with many other Departments.We think also that a Government Departmentshould not bo asked to move unless it is quiteaclear that other promises in/suitablo situationat present in private occupation cannot be obtained.1&apos;Since the above letter was written the joint legal Department for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Office of Woods has been established,., and Br.- Jones is legal adviser to tho Board&quot;and solicitor to tho Commissioners of Woods.     The members of Mr,- Jones&apos; s staff do work for both Departments,Br, B.LS Robinson? tho Superintending Forestry Inspector to the Board Is also forestry adviser tc the Office of Woods, and there is practically a joint forestry branch, for the two Departments. It would bo quite impossible for all the members of these two joint branches to-be removed to a distance from the Office of tho Board, and th o inconvenience and difficulty of splitting the staffs into two &apos; is obvious., &apos;The individual officers of the Office of Woods, as well as those who have to do with both-Departments have, of course, arrangod their places of residence with tho view to their accessibility from Whitehall, and much loss of .timo and expense will be incurred if the men have to journey to
Mg^UNDUM ON THE OBJECTIONS RAISED BY Tj-IE OFFICE OF WOODS TO THE PROPOSED REMOVAL OB THE STAFF FROB WHITEHALL TO THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, SOUTH KENSINGTON.I.     With reference to the objections raised to the proposed removal of the Office of Woods and Forests from Whitehall in November, 1915, it should be said that, since that date many other premises have been requisitioned and hired in the Whitehall district and that the difficulty of obtaining more accommodation for the War Departments in that area has increased immensely,2, There are no other premises in private occupation In so suitable a situation, and none other near which could be requisi-tioned without much trouble, delay and expense.3.     Reference to old documents is necessary in many Government Departments and no difficulty is anticipated in forming a strong room in the basement of the Natural History Museum for the Office of Woods deeds.   It is more than likely, however, that the Office of Woods would prefer to leave the documents in question where they are provided they could have access to them, a matter which could no doubt be arranged with the Admiralty,   In that case strong room space could readily be provided in the Natural History Museum buildings sufficient for the number of documents it would be essential to have removed from, the Office of Woods.4,     Of the professional advisers mentioned in the margin of the Office of woods memorandum, Bessrs Carter, Jones &amp; Co,, are the only ones located quite near the Office of Woods. Messrs Gluttons are in Great College Street and Mr. John Murray in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall,     The full use of telephone facilities would materially lessen the need for personal interviewsj moreover   ,the
the communication between Westminster and South Kensington by Underground is very good indeed.   These remarks apply also to the objection raised in the case of the joint Legal and Forestry Branches, whose positions are somewhat analogous to that of the Treasury Solicitor, who acts for several Government Offices and who is, of course&apos;) housed in a separate building at a greater or less distance from them.   The arrangement does not appear in his case to militate against efficiency.5.   During the war, and even before, far larger Departments than the Office of Woods have been removed comparatively long distances, e.g., the Board of Education las recently been transferred from Whitehall to South Kensington.    Doubtless some of the staff of the Office of Woods would benefit by the removal to that locality, while others would be inconvenienced by the change.   The argument that the clerks have arranged their places of residence with a view to accessibility to Whitehall can, however, hardly weigh when the efficiency of one of the most important Branches of the War Office, and another of the Admiralty during the War is involved.
