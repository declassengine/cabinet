(AssistantSecretary) .The Committee had under consideration -SRICAN CO-PERATION Ifl IK WARFARE.-General Sir David Henderson The point was that apart1,    AMERICAN CO-OPERATION In AIR Warfare(Memorandum by LvY-Gen. Sir David HendersonA.P.C.     ),2.    THE ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL FOR THE PROGRAM OF NAVAL AIRCRAFT:(Letter from ths Admiralty forwarding a Memorandum dated 5th Dec., 1917 - A.P.C.56)1.     THE CHAIRMAN explained that the first question for discussion was that of American Co-operation in Air- i Warfare, the general principles of which were as shown in the memorandum by Lieut which had been circulated, from providing our own bombing programme, we should ask the Americans to co-operate, particularly in night bombing,SIR DAVID HENDERSON said that the Americans might be able to complete their own programme, but if net, help could be given from current French end English resources.    They were training, pilots in large numbers, in which work we were helping them.    They had allocated large factories for the production of aeroplanes, but actual output depended on that of the standardized Liberty engine, which had not yet been finally approved They also were building Eandley Page machines of British pattern for which they had our drawings.   Lord North-cliff e had stated in Paris that the Americans were doubtful what policy they should pursue, whether they should turn out large numbers of fighting, reconnaissance or bombing machines and if the last ,  of what kind,  and were expecting us to give them a lead.   We had a certain line laid down as far. as we were concerned and our programme for day bombing machines.was /
adequate, but that for night bombing was not.   Colonel Boiling and General Foulois who were shortly coming to England, had stated that if we could lay down a line of policy for the Americans to follow, Washington would fall in with it.THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that Lord Northcliffe had drawn attention to the question of shipping which was really the crux of the matter,  and that it was no use owdefining a lino of policy for production unless sea transport to carry the machines could be arranged.   As regards Handley Page bombing machines., he understood that the scheme was that they would be shipped broken up and then assembled on this side; that the organisation and part of the training of the units would also be^done on this side - the Americans providing pilots and other personnel, estimated at 14,000 technical and 10,500 labour for the construction of aerodromes: and that the material required for sheds would also be imported; all of which necessitated shipping.SIR ERIC GEDDES enquired as to how far this special problem   differed from the general proposition of proiiding shipping for the supply of American Forces.GENERAL HENDERSON pointed out that shipping had been allotted for   specific services i,e, so much for the Army, and a ruling   was required as to the relative importance of air material and personnel, since priority for them implied the curtailment of the tonnage allotted to other services, e*g. infantry,munitions etc,THE CHAIRMAN said that the amount of shipping involved was not large and could be estimated.   When once this Was worked out the necessary adjustments to the whole American programme could be made.GENERAL RENDERSOS pressed for a reply,  decisive *s to policy before the American representatives should arrive in the Country.SIR ERIC GEDDES pointed out that-the American Government had stated that the transportation of their forces was their own concern.THE CHAIRMAN added that nevertheless, they would require assistance from England.SIR ERIC GEDDES suggested that whatever authority allotted tonnage could give a decision,THE CHAIRMAN drew attention to Sir Guy GranetJ s paper on the shipping question. From, his figures, it was evident that the Americans must have help,SIR ERIC GEDDES suggested the conditions could be ameliorated and tonnage saved owing to the fact that we had reserves in France which could be used for helping the Americans, while a portion of the reserves could be held in America.GENERAL HENDERSON was of opinion that the Americans must judge for themselves as to what they could transport but they had asked for guidance in this particular direction. It was nc use ts proceed with an extensive programme unless the question of shipping was settled.
THE CHAIRMAN understood that the oortemplated programme was for 120 Handley Page machines monthly a3 wastage, hut enquired what umber would be involved in the first instance.GENERAL HENDERSON explained that these 120 machines were to go on accumulating to form a reserve.SIR ERIC GEDDES encored if the 60^squadrons contemplated were joint British and American.     Sir William Weir pointed out that the programme was for the American contribution to night &quot;qpmbing operations and way additional to our own.THE CHAIRMAN asked if the programme was for 30 training squadrons and 30 on the front (each squadron of 10 machines) to which General Henderson replied in the affirmative.SIR WILLIAM WEIR pointed out that this was only avery small part of the total programme,     IL was the numberwhich we had stated we could assemble here. The Americans would probably ask for more.THE CHAIRMAN enquired if we could give the Americans sufficient help in training.GENERAL SALMOND answered we could, provided American labour was provided.SIR WILLIAM WEIR suggested that the American labour personnel should be shipped at an early stage.THE CHAIRMAN&apos;S view was that we advised America what would in our opinion be required,  and it was for them to make arrangements to carry this out.GENERAL SALMOND said that he had spoken to Sir Samuel Pay who had stated that there was no difficulty in shipping the 15., 000 Americans who were to come over to England.THE CHAIRMAN enquired at what stage the labcir would be required,  andGENERAL 3ALMOND replied that labcur to erect the 6 aerodromes was required three months before the machines arrived,  in other words,   immediately.,GENE RAL WHI GUAM asked if the Americans could supply ait the labour, to which General Henderson replied in the affirmativecTHE CHAIRMAN enquired whether material for construct-ing aerodromes would.be required from America, andSIR WILLIAM WEIR said, that timber would be. but that the Americans.might preferferro-concrete construction, in which they specialized.SIR ERIC GEDDES added that ferro-concrete work needed iron, and that since the French should not help we should have to do socGENERAL SALMOND suggested the machines should be lodged in hangars.THE SHAIRMAN then suggested that the subject matter cr the programme outlined in General Henderson&apos;s suggested programme should be discussed with the American represents-tives expected next day, and should then be brought before the Air Policy Committee.
GEBEBAL 3ALM02TD stated that the programme was based on &apos; informal discussions which had taken place with the Americans in Paris.It was.then decided thatlord Rcthermere, General Henderson, General Salmond and Sir Wm.Weir should discuss the programme put forward in Paper A.P-.0.6. with the American representatives and draft a cable giving the .outlineb which should be des-patched to Washington after approval by the Air Polio? Committee.THE CHAIRMAN then drew attention to the fact that there was no scheme for the bombing of Constantinople and the Bagdad railway by the R.N.A*S.COMMODORE PAINE said that the R.N.A.S-, had certain machines in the Aegean.SIR ERIC GEDDES explained that by far the best results would be attained by attacking the Goeben and Breslau, since the former vessel dominated Constantinople,   It was, however, a moot point whether bombs could disable a battleship.GENERAL HENDERSON stated that the output of Handley-Page machines would commence.in; February 1918, that we could use all turned out in France, but that their best employment would have to be considered,   No great difficulty would be involved in their use in the Near East, since the machines could be flown out, and the amount of tonnage required to carry spares would not be great.GENERAL SALMOND suggested the installation in Egypt of. a large Aviation Base for American personnel and squadrons.OETRAL H7T1ID&quot; ESOII added the adoption of such a course would enable the submarines to be evaded.THE CHAIRMAN was of opinion that this subject should be discussed further and that the Navy should also be asked to go in for more extended operations.SIR ERIC G1DDES said that the matter would be considered co soon as machines were available.HIE ADE-    II,SIR URIC GEDBES, in reference to Paper A.P,C.5. stated 5JJACY OF that&apos; the point in question was that of the supply cf personnel pRSOpiEL for Naval Aircraft, since it has been stated at the Second FOR THE^ &quot;Meeting of the Air Policy Committee h-n Oct. 31st that the 1?aval PROGRAMME Aircraft personnel cas inadequate.     He pointed out that theIf AVAL   Navy was able to maintain itself and. provide a certain surplus.. AIRCRAFT. He brought this matter up as he thought it would be of&apos; interest to the new Air Ministry. ..It was explained that the Air Ministry was not formally&apos; installed as yet.
SIR ERIC GEDDFS,. said, certain points, would have to be considered, such as, Tar exampie, whether Bonnie-bristle should be taken over by the Air Service or remain with the Fleet.COMMODORE PAJiTE stated that it would regain with theFleet.SIR.DAVID,HENDERSON pointed out that nothing could be definitely fixed as to the relative scope of the Services until the new Air Council was formedThe Committee noted the Memorandum by the Admiralty on &quot;The adequacy of personnel for the programme of Naval Aircraft.&quot;2 Whitehall Gardens, 8.F.14th December 1917.
