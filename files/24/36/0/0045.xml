3^10 /CIRCULATED TO THE KING AND THE WA^CABINET,I        / r      ISI^a-^Ttaiian^ see me this- &amp;fter*noon at the request of the Jrjrne Minister, . He leftwith me the annexed  telegrams ah out the coal situationin Italy and urged very emphatically the dangers ofthe present situation.   Indeed he did not scruple tosay that unless some means could be found for relievingthe situation-$here might be a revolution in Italy andthat in any caso great difficulty would he experiencedin carrying on tho war&amp;   I urged him to go and seethe Shipping Controller hut hQ said that he hadrepeat eHy been tp see him, and that the ShippingController could do nothing unless he were giveninstructions lay tho War Cebinetft   He asked whether itwould be desirable to see the prime Minister and Itold him that it was very difficult, that the PrimeMinister was very much engaged and that it was nobeasy even for his colleagues to see him, but that inhis place I should certainly recommend him to seek aninterview! with him,, He told mo that there was no sutjeewhich was more desirable for enemy propaganda bothin reference to tho hardships caused by the want ofcoal and because it was widely believod that in thesematterasas in se many others, the French receive bettertreatment from us than the Italians.   I tried to represent to tho Ambassadorihat this 7/as a mistake,but he would hear nothing of itc   I tsld him that avery urgent telegram had been sent t$ tho French Govern-ment asking them to send in coal to Italy, and he pre-mised tc inform his Government of that facto(Signed) Robert Cecil.
Rome, 16th December 1917.please call Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s attention to what follows.   The situation in Italy consequent on lack of wheat and coal grows graver day by day. We shall be compelled considerably&apos;to reduce the output of arms and munitions in the same way ne have already reduced railway passenger and goods service, and gas illumination, $which we have suppressed in 130 toims, keeping it going in eight only,) unless Italy is supplied with the monthly quantities which I personally requested when in London last May, for which we have continuously pressed since then, and which was-again put forward as our requirements by the Italian Delegates at the Paris Conference on the 1st December.Our conditions, if further demonstration is required can be specially represented by Baron Mayor, in connection with the strictly moderate tonnage requirements indicated in Paris as absolutely essen-tial to our transports.   On that occasion the British Government was urgently requested not to delay further in taking all measures in their power to help the crying needs of Italy.   With regard to the coal situation it is sufficient to, recall that arrivals expected in December (representing already only about half of the quantity needed for our restricted consumption) are actually proving con-siderably below the expected figure.   We are unable to draw any further on our reserves, as we have done hitherto so as to supplement the insufficient arrivals,for*
for our stocks arc practically exhausted *The fact that I address you personally, and beg you to lay the question directly before the Head of the British Government, proves that at the present moment the question is not a technical but a political one.   our grave&apos;&quot;deficiencies of coal were once again technically recognized at the Paris Conference, and on that occasion prance undertook to supply us, exceptionally, with 150,000 tons, which srho in her turn intended to ask the return of from England. It appears that England, on her side;- cannot undertake this obligation,   I cannot enter into a matter which concerns the British and French Governments; but I repeat that Italy&apos;s position is such as to- demand lrrniediats aid. Even were we to stop altogether the production of arms and munitions, limiting the use of coal to the railways only, I beg you to note that, even with the extremely limited train service now working, our requirements amount to 215,000 tons per month. Railway traffic in Italy is already largely paralyzed: about 3000 wagons loaded with essential commodities necessary to the country&apos;s existence, ara stationary through lack of coal in our depots - now a daily occurrence. Unless immediate help is forthcoming the situation must grow worse, with consequences perhaps,,, even graver than those of a Military defeat.This is the actual situation which it is my duty -bo lay.before you with all candour. We can certainly not be reproached with having delayed calling attentionto
to the situation- as Your Excellency remembers I myself came to London last May,- in order personally to re-prasant the full gravity of the position^   putting aside all technical discussions-, it is necessary immediately to provide for the despatch of the 150,000 tons which were speken of at the Paris Conference.J am addressing a like communication to our Ambassador in Paris..Orlando,
