PROPOSED BORINGS FOR COAL IN IRELAND.

(Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland).

The Memorandum of the Minister of Reconstruction in favour of some moderate expenditure on trial borings for coal in the region of Lough Neagh recommends an exploratory work which as I am advised ought to be carried out and is well warranted by the facts already known as to the geolegical characteristics of the district in question. Every such operation has of course valuable, incidental advantages in Ireland from a political point of view.
