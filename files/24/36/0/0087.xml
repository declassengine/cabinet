LORD BALPOUR OF BURLEIGH1S COMMITTEE.PUBLIC AT IOLTJ)F REPORT. Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.I ask for authority to Dublish the Reports of the Committee cn Commercial and Industrial Policy after the :Iar. It is now general known that the Final Report of the Committee has bees   presented, an in any case it will not be possible to delay publication for long.  I do not think that&apos;the Government can properly arrive at definite conclusions upon the wide issues of policy raised by the Report,unti they have been publicly discussed and public opinion of them can be fudged.    Moreover by immediate publication the Government will make it clear that it&apos; has not yet considered, and is not committed to, an; of the actual recommendations.    If on the other hand the Report is published after an interval only, it may be thought to have the considered approval of the Government.There is a further reason for publication in the fact that the general recommendations of the Report, affect a number of detailed questions of reconstruction which are being investigated by special Committees.    These Committees are anxious to have the Report without, which they feel difficulty in pursuing their inquiries.      But I see great objection to distributing it widely among non-official members, if it is not desired that its contents should be generally known.CHRISTOPHER ADDISON. 22.12.17.
