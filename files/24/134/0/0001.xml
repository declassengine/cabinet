C.P.3801

Unemployment Insurance.

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

I make the following observations on the Memorandum of the Minister of Labour C.P. 3784 as to unemployment insurance.

1. Rates of Benefit.

The rates proposed in the Memorandum, viz., 16s. for married men plus 1s. for each child, 12s. for single men and 10s. for women, are, as will appear later, the highest which financial circumstances allow us to contemplate, so that, if they are inserted in the Bill as introduced, there will be no possibility of making any concession during its passage. If this is recognised, I should not take exception to the rates.

I have since learned that the Minister of Labour proposes that the rate for married men should be fixed at 17s. in lieu of the 16s. first proposed. This would add rather more than Â£1,000,000 a year to the cost and is in my view unjustifiable.

In his Memorandum C.P.3721 the Minister of Health has referred to difficulties which may be raised on the Health Insurance side by the differentiation between the benefits paid to married and single men, notwithstanding that the contributions are equal. It is for consideration whether the differentiation should not be limited to the deficiency period: this would appear to meet the difficulty raised.
      2..    T-ha. first special period.             It is proposed *Va.1-pay 10 weeks benefit during the;.r^riad of 27 weeks from 26th April to 2nd November 1922.             Trhe new special period ia to qojame.noa on April 26th,, via. three weeks from  ha end of the present special period.    If we are unable to withstand the conaaqLuenoes of. a lapse  of benefit for more than three waeka in April, la i$ probable, that we- shf^l. he. able to gel over a gap, of four months from. July, to Ootober?    If,  as I should fear, force pf ciroumataneea compelled a further concession of say another five weeke maximum.,wc,uld probably $$a, a figure approae.h^f  &quot; .  1,500,000 to the,: already large deficit produced by the schema, I am compelled to suggest that the spec,ial period should &apos;be$in net, ea^li^r,. than. May. 9.th,.            :.....&apos; v          The, period November 1922 to November 1923 *  &quot;%            I It; jut proposed th&amp;t a per$e4 of 13 we$kj &quot;benefit pine, a p^er^^saelYe, /IQ^weekf. should^ $e- payable in the year from 17CYember 1923 to $ovemper 19S3,  it is not stated whether this benefit  is to., be,, &apos; 4fnendent in some way on 0,qntr4butiQnB paid&apos;9?.^V;-y&apos;f &quot;&apos;iU.t, M.-4 *xV*-\;-,f&apos;.r r&apos;&quot;Ud&apos;   i  \ -  &apos;..;&apos;.            .1&apos; attach a mewqran^uw by the Government Aotuary in which ^rdr^wa attention to the fact that this proposal would seriously; hamper, and might render nugatory the work of the Committee! appointed on the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee which examined the Ge tides  Report, to consider the amalgamation of the Health and Insurance cards and&quot; to examine other possibilities of effecting economies in administration.      i       It will be agreed that a joint card,.,if it can be seouredj  and all other&quot; economies in administration are exceeding ly desirable, and I support the objection to providing now for a maxinum of 26 weeks henefit from next November *            ,1 entirely agree wi,th the Minister of Labour as to                                                        the
  the importance of putting an end to the praotioe that has been  forced upon us in recent months of going to the House ofC Commons at short intervals with a now Bill to deal with  unemployment -insurance.   But the Bill now to be introduced  cannot be final,, and.further legislation would still be  neeOssary to giyo effect to the proposed economies in the  administration. ...     im  ,             &apos;\,\ .          l&apos;*$\       Ji.y, 1 propose therefore that we should not now legislate  as to the benefit period in the twflve months from November ;no3tt.- -v         * v   . .    &apos; *  &quot;.           &quot; r&apos;* r i;;&apos;:;v&apos;v-:&apos;4ii  : Contributions.    &apos;   .-&apos;&quot;&apos;w&quot; \&quot;&apos;    r &quot;&quot;&apos;      &apos;.  ;  *-   &quot;,-r-;X agree with the Minister &quot;of-Lab our ;tha&apos;t the  contributions payable by,.employers &quot;and workpeople in respect &apos; of.(,UttjaaBployed workers *&apos; dependents  mustjbo-Jcontihued:  -the : task of financing; unemployment insurance&apos;is; impossible on any  other---basis.  ;. But. I see strong obj0otion: to continuing the  State contribution, to  that particular scheme on its present  level..-.!.,            fhe- State oontribution to unemployment insurance is - normally . one-f if tl* of  the whole, but in the exceptional  clrcumstanc.es attaching to the unemployed workers* dependents&apos;  scheme! which it will bo remembered woe introduced for six  months only, the State Oontribution to the separate fund then  set up was throe-seventhe (men) and one-half (women).  She  I?und  is now to be amalgamated with the main Unemployment Fund  and in my opinion we should revert to the normal proportion  of one-fifth.  The longer the abnomai arrangemehts continue  the greater the danger that in tho and tn&apos;o&apos;&apos;vit^oojaer.wlll be  permanently burdened with a contribuVion.exceeding One-fifth.            My proposal is that tho State contribution;should be  one-fifth, oorrosponding to ^1,500,000 in 19&apos;22/2S*  In, view  of the exhauetion of the funds at the disposal of the National  Beb,t  Commissioners it will, X am advised, be impossible to.  avoid voting .85,000,000 in 1922/23 and my proposal is  that   1,500,000 should be a final charge and  3,500,000 a repayable  advance.
     5-  Solvency of the Fund,          The Minister proposes that the &quot;borrowing powers should be extended from . g0\ 000.000 to  25 &apos; 000,000       &apos;-  -&apos;tt was contemplated last year that the Fund wouldbe able tV repay its debt to the Treasury by Ju&amp;y 3923.  so serious hW b^en the effect of the continued high unemploymentthat it seams improbable that the Fund will have begun repayingby that date; &quot;  &apos;          Ae I have already stated it is not practicable toincrease the borrowing&quot;powers except by voting tha money asa repayable adfah&amp;eJ lie, increasing the burden on the 1922/23Bstimatee by a further aum in addition to the  5,000,000referred to above. **     6, &apos; -Atoinifltration. &apos; ;i  *     &apos;;The cost of&apos; administering the Fund up to 10$ of theincome ip bharged to the Fund;  any excess over 10$ %n charged to the ISxchequer.  The cost has in e^ch year exceeded 10$ byvarying but always substantial amounts.x\w:*:&apos;,\  -The scheme&apos;nW&quot; proposed will render it necessaryto distinguish between married and single men and to obtainparticularsi^aeHo&quot;numbers of &quot;children etc, and will obviouslyincrease !ihe icet;&apos;of &apos;&quot;adaiihietraiion.  Having regard to these facts-1 -propose&apos; that&quot; the appropriation from the Fund should beincreased to l12$$.          *&apos;                           R.S.H.             &quot; &apos;.

X- undcrcei.avid- that Dr. Macwamara  is putting fox-ward a proposal to- the C a by net for an em*.&apos;*.-3ttont of  the tJn-e-svplo^ciant Innurau.&apos;^ A $s to:provide for a uperlai peri o A  of 10 weeks bag:, AUK   o;i April     S;;-th   th. a ic.zr.JLer prorisSpjc cf  6 we eke -besfriive ir -the year b? iy;,.i:;.^g Ko-sembe-x YI-S^T a/*d aiding October        At the moment of wrl.ii/ig I  am .t:ot certs In that this 26 --ftfcfcks is to be automatic or whether  it  :*s to be proposed as a period of 16 weeks followed  by a  pea $ no.ire 10 weeks.  The difference of form is not, however, material.&quot;           If notwithstanding the present condition of the Fund and the prospects of the isaaediate future, 26 weeks of benefits be now granted (by an amending Act) in the year begin- ning$ovemher 1922,  no less than 20 weeks  of benefit can ever be given as the yearly maximum.  This period is, in fact, the maximum named in the first Act of 1981, but  it  has never come into force.  The present proposal of the Minister of Labour will incorporate it definitely in the system and it will he impossible to get away from it afterwards.           You are aware that an Interdepartmental Committee under $y Chairmanship has been working for some weeks in the hope of effecting a large saving in the administration of unemployment insurance by using the administrative machinery of health insurance to some extent.   It is  fundamental to the use of a common card that eome complete change  should be made as regardB the one-in-six ruae for unemployment benefit.  In my judgment however it would be extremely  diffioult to give benefit for 26 weeks without the protection  of  the one-in-six rule and the effeot of the Ministers present proposal is, therefore, to prejudice very seriously the freedom of the Committee to explore ways in which the desired  economies                                                        might
 might be secured.  For this reason I submit that if it is *ueo*eeary at the present time to make provision for the position betweenOJorember 1928 and November 1923 thatIproriei-on-.-should be something materially loos than 26 weeks. Zt might be possible, when the Committee has reported, to increase whatever period of benefit may now be provided;   it would never be possible to reduce it,           Zt is evident that in November next the Unemployment Fund will owe many-, mill lone to the Exchequer.  Z respectfully submit that this is not a oonditlon in which benefit should be granted for 26 weeks, considering that hitherto, and with a much smaller debt, no longer periods than Id weeks with a permissive extension by 6 weeks, have been granted.  Zt may be replied to this that the 26 weeks&apos; benefit is not to be &quot;unc covenanted&quot;, as have been the previous special periods, and that it is to be related to contributions paid.  My answer to this would be that the adoption of any such conditions at the present time would still further hamper the Znterdepart* mental Committoo.   Zf deoleions are now to be taken that will rule out the possibility of any recommendations of the Committee as to benefits being brought into operation before November 1923, and if the benefit system in the year ending October 1923 is to be such as oreato expectations as to the future which  the Committee may be unable to satisfy, it becomes a matter of doubt as to whether the Committee can usefully go on with the work entrusted to it,                                            A.w*.VA?80N*                                                2Hh February, 1922.
