March 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3855.                                 CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.             MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.    I SUBMIT, for the consideration of the Cabinet, my survey for the week ended the 13th instant.                       GENERAL STATE OF THE  COUNTRY.    The situation in Southern Ireland has been considerably eased  since my lastReport by the solution of the deadlock between  the opposing sections of the  Irish.Republican  Army  in  Limerick.   As a result of negotiations  carried through in dublin between the leaders of both sides, in which the Mayor of Limerick is under-stood to have taken a leading part, an arrangement was come to on the 11th instantwhereby both parties agreed  to evacuate the town simultaneously and to leave the barracks in the possession of  a local unit of the Irish  Republican Army which hadtaken no part in the dissensions.  Inasmuch as this unit was known to be loyal tothe General Headquarters Staff in Dublin,  the settlement arrived at may be regardedas a distinct check to the disruptive forces at work in the organisation,  and as suchit was received with unqualified approval and satisfaction by the Nationalist Press.The agreement was promptly  and faithfully carried out by the forces of both parties on the following day, and normal conditions were quickly restored in  the district.    The number of breaches of the truce was considerably less than  that of theprevious week, the reduction  being, no doubt, due in some  measure to the fact thatthe police are now concentrated in strong bodies and present fewer opportunities for attack.  Only one casualty was sustained,  the  case of  a constable who was fired at and wounded in Cork City on  the 9th instant.  Two other cases of attempted murdersof policemen were  reported, both of which occurred in Galway  on the 7th instant,and took the form of firing into  the house of the intended  victim.  In one of  thesecases the wife of a sergeant was  wounded  in the head by a revolver bullet firedthrough  the  door.   Apart from these cases of attempted  assassination the mostserious breaches of the truce committed during the week were two attacks on policebarracks,  one at Dunshaughlin, Co.  Meath,  and  the  other  at Ballinasloe, Co.Galway, both on the 9th instant.  The attacks in both  cases were abortive and  half-hearted  affairs and resulted  in  no casualties  to the  garrisons  or damage to the barracks.    Other breaches included  the thefts of a police motor-car, a  police  bicycle, the seizure of four civilian motor-cars for non-payment of levies to the Irish republican army and one raid  for arms.    A serious violation of the amnesty was committed at Dunshaughlin,  Co. Meath,on the 7th instant by the attempted assassination of an ex-member of the  Royal  irish constabulary,- who was badly  wounded by gunshots fired into his house.  The victimof this outrage was disbanded from the Force on the 6th ultimo. -    While the continued activities of the so-called Republican Courts are regrettableon many grounds,  and particularly on account of their  complicating and constitu-tional issues involved  in the responsibility  of  the Provisional Government for administering the country in accordance with the  terms and intention of the Treaty,it must be admitted that, in conjunction with the I.R.A., they are now performingvery useful practical work  in filling the vacuum created by  the withdrawal of thepolice forces from the greater part of  Southern Ireland. I am informed that  theirproceedings are conducted in the main with fairness and impartiality,  and that their      [8058]
sentences in criminal cases conform, generally, with the standards of the ordinarylegal Courts.  There is certainly no evidence that the amount of non-political crimehas increased  in consequence of police evacuation, or that,  so far as the ordinarycitizen is concerned, there is any greater insecurity  of life or property.                         STATE OF THE  POLICE FORCES.

The whole of  the twenty-six counties of Southern Ireland  have  now  been evacuated by the Royal  Irish Constabulary, with the exception of the counties of &apos;Dublin, Kildare, Queen&apos;s Co., Donegal, Roscommon, Westmeath and Cork, and thewhole Force is  now concentrated in sixteen centres in those counties preparatory toits disbandment.  Arrangements have been made for carrying through the disband-ment of the Force with all possible despatch as soon as the terms of disbandment havebeen finally settled  with the Treasury.                   PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND.    The political situation in Southern Ireland has undergone no important develop-ment during the week.  A series of successful public demonstrations have been heldin favour of the Treaty,  but the platform campaign is still in its infancy, and muchpropaganda work remains to be done if  Mr. Griffith and his colleagues are to be assured of an adequate majority at the forthcoming elections.  The demonstrationaddressed by Mr. Collins in Cork City on  the 12th instant  exceeded  in dimensionsany similar demonstration held in the South of  Ireland  in recent  years, and  is admitted on all sides to have been a striking success notwithstanding  the deliberateand determined efforts made by a section  of the opposition  party to  wreck it by methods of violence,  which  included the  firing of revolvers for. the purpose offrightening the spectators and creating confusion.  The fact that such  methods couldbe resorted to, however, is a significant indication of the quarter from which the :real danger to the Treaty is to be  apprehended, viz., the intimidation of voters in country1,132    41,128
districts where the extremist section has succeeded in establishing itself in control ofthe I.R.A.    The latest effort at the obstruction of the Treaty on the part of the RepublicanParty  is the plea now  put forward by Mr. de Valera that a new Parliamentaryregister will be necessary if the elections are to represent the true opinion and wishes of the  country.  To this suggestion Mr. Griffith has replied in emphatic terms thathe will not be a party to preventing the electorate from expressing their judgment atthe expiration of the three months period already agreed to,  and  that  any further postponement of the elections would be contrary to the interests  of the country.    It is much to be regretted that the strained relations at present existing betweenthe Provisional Government and the Government of Northern Ireland  hold out  no prospect of an early meeting of the leaders on both sides with  a view to  an amicable settlement of immediate difficulties.  The open declaration of war upon the irish republican Army made by the Northern Minister for Home Affairs has aroused graveapprehensions in the minds of  the  people of Southern Ireland, who regard it  asforeshadowing a course of policy which may lead to the present state of tension  onthe border developing into one of open conflict.
