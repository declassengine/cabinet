The sanction of the Cabinet Is sought to the intro-duotlon of this Bill at an early date.   It is an agreedmeasure for dealing with a recognised and. growing difficulty and is not expected to be controversial.     Attention has for some time past been called to the trouble oaused hy quantities of oil floating on the surfaceof the water in estuaries, ports, and around the ooast.This oil, which is of a heavy character and does notdissipate, becomes a serious nuisanoe when washed ashoreat watering places, and in harbours and docks it is apossible source of danger.   It is also stated to beinjurious to fish.     Representatives of the interests mainly ooncerned,viz., Dook Authorities, Shipowners and Oil Companies met at the Board of Trade to consider with representatives ofthe Board of Trade and Ministry of Transport whether someremedy could be deviBed.   All parties expressed their willingness to help in finding a solution of the problem,and a small Committee of representatives of the interestswas appointed to devise a remedy.   This Committee whichhad several meetings prepared this Bill.     The essence of the Bill is in Clause 1 which make sit a penal offence to discharge oil or oily water intonavigable waters whether from a ship or from a shoreinstallation.   The remaining clauses provide certaincheckB and give powers to inspect, but Clause 1 ig themain part of the Bill.     The draft Bill has been seen  confidentially by therepresentatives of the interests concerned, and it is not expected that there will be any opposition.C A B I NET.SECRET.OIL IN NAVIGABLE WATERS BILL.CP.  3871.(Initialled)  S.
