[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1922.CONFIDENTIAL.CP, 3829.DISBANDMENT OF THE RIG.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.    I CIRCULATE  herewith a letter with enclosure which  I  addressed  to theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury on the 24th February last embodying proposalsfor the treatment of the Royal Irish Constabulary on Disbanclment.    In an Appendix I also circulate  a Memorandum  dated  the 5th ultimo  by theChief of Police, together with a covering note by Mr. Cope, the  Assistant Under-Secretary.    The estimated cost of this scheme is  1,250,000.    I also attach a copy of a letter dated the 24th ultimo, with  enclosures,  whichI have received from General Tudor on this subject.    In Part IV of the Appendix are reproduced two documents  forwarded to me bythe Director of Intelligence,  Ireland,  which exemplify the  difficulties with  which members of the R.I.C. who may desire to continue to live in Ireland will be faced-after disbandment.  The first of these documents is a circular recently received by alllandlords at Dromahair, Co. Leitrim, while the second is a report from the CountyInspector, Sligo, showing the menacing attitude of the local I.R.A. towards membersIrish Office, Old Queen Street, S.W. 1.          March 11, 1922.LETTER FROM CHIEF  SECRETARY FOR IRELAND TO THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE                                 TREASURY.    I AM much worried at the present time in regard to the immediate future ofthe Royal Irish Constabulary.    I fully appreciate that the Pensions terms already announced afford a generousprovision for these men as soon as tbey have been able to re-establish themselvesin some new walk of life.  In the intervening period, however, I cannot but feelunless some further  expedient  can be devised their situation will, in many cases,be deplorable.  The  bitterness of feeling in Ireland, and the consequent almostimpossibility of finding any employment in their country, places them in a radicallywrorse position than any other class of public servants  whose services have beendispensed with in the past, or may be dispensed with in the future, in this country.    The Representative Bodies of the Force  have urged most strongly the necessityfor making some provision by  way of disturbance allowance.  The claims whichthey put forward are, I agree,  frankly out of the question, but as the result  of careful consideration I feel convinced  that it is the duty of the Government to take such further steps as may lie in  their power to help these men  over the difficult period with which they will be faced during the next  two or three years.    I enclose a draft copy of  a Memorandum which has been  prepared  in myDepartment in which  are embodied certain proposals  which, if adopted, would undoubtedly  go  some  way towards Jielping these  men  without incurring  any permanent additional expenditure on any considerable  scale.   I  must, however,frankly confess I do not consider that the scheme outlined in the Memorandum is sufficiently wide in its scope fairly to  meet the case.  I think, however, that  this could be done  if, in addition  to the advance (ultimately recoverable  from theof the R.I.C.H. G..My dear Financial Secretary,Irish Office, Old Queen Street,     February 24, 1922.[8025]B
recipient or not, according to circumstances), the  Government were to make a freegift to each of the Irish enlisted Members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (some7,800 in number) of a sum at least equal (and I think it ought to be more thanequal) and additional to that proposed in tlie draft Memorandum, to  be made asan advance.     1  attach  the greatest importance  to this  question, and 1 should  be most grateful if you&apos;could arrange to discuss the matter with ine in the very near future.The matter is peculiarly pressing  as the demobilisation  of  the British recruits ofthe Permanent Force is now almost  completed, and it is essential from every pointof view to begin the disbaiidinent of the Irish members of the Force at the earliestpossible moment.  Every week continues  to witness the  assassination of membersof that Force, and 1 feel it is incumbent on  us to  give them the earliest possible opportunity of leaving Ireland.                                         Yours sincerely,                                      (Signed)       HAMAR GREENWOOD.E. Hilton Young, Esq., D.S.O., D.S.C.,  M.P.,    -                 Treasury.     NOTE. The following is an estimate of the cost  involved in the Scheme for payment  to Irish members of  the Permanent Force of a  gratuity in respect ofDisturbance as suggested in the penultimate  paragraph  of the Chief  Secretary&apos;sletter to the Financial Secretary :         One month&apos;s pay to all members   ....       ....       ....   170,750        A further one month&apos;s pay to all  married members   ....    82,085        A grant of M5 in respect of each child under  1(5  years             of age (married members = 3,745, assumed average             number of children  per family ^ 3, estimated total             number of children  - 11,235)  ....      ....       ....     56,175                                                               309,610                                  Enclosure.         IRISH OFFICE MEMORANDUM ON THE DISBANDMENT OF THE R.I.C.    THE decision  to  disband the  R.I.C. involved the grant to them of  the most favourable terms contemplated  under the Ninth Schedule of the Government  ofIreland Act, 1920, namely, a pension based on length of service with twelve* addedyears, the pensionable salary  being that which the pensioner would normally havebeen receiving after the lapse of twelve years from the  date of retirement, providedthat in no  case should  the  pension so awarded exceed two-thirds  of  the actualpensionable  salary.    The decision to disband the Force was received with  satisfaction by the greatmajority of  officers  and men; but they  have submitted, through their representative bodies,  claims for compensation on disbandment additional to the pension mentionedabove.    A summary of  these claims, which were put before  me at interviews  on the 6th,7th and 8th  instant, is attached.    The only undertaking given to the Representative Bodies at these interviewswas that a  strong  impartial Tribunal should be set up to consider and advise theGovernment upon any individual cases in which it appeared  that special hardshipmight arise.    The greater part of the representations  made by the  Representative  Bodieswere  clearly exaggerated, and the demands based upon them could not be justified.The claim,  for example,  for six years&apos; full pay as compensation for loss of office and, indeed, any claim in respect of loss of office is totally inadmissible, and thestatement that no member of  the Force will be able in  future to  live in any part ofIreland cannot be accepted.  Similarly, no claim for more favourable treatment than    * All members of the R.I.C. below the  rank of District Inspector who joined prior to July 1,1919,-will be entitled, if they so desire, to remain on a pension scale calculated in fiftieths instead  of sixtieths, inwhich case the number of added years will be ten instead of twelve.
is  accorded to them  under the terms  as  at  present  approved could possibly  bemaintained  on behalf  of  the  men recruited  during the past two years in GreatBritain.    In the course of the discussion, however, two points emerged, which  appear to necessitate- at  any rate an adjustment of the terms already agreed upon :     1. It is clear that a certain number of the R.I.C.  (it is impossible at  present to           estimate how great this number  will be) will be unable to  settle down in           their homes, and will have to remove elsewhere.  Provision must be made           for disturbance allowance in&apos;such cases.    2. The  pension in the case of  the younger men, whose service is comparatively           short, will-not be (and is  not intended to be) sufficient to enable them to           live and support their families  without other employment.  During the           next  two or three years, however, until the present bitter feeling against           the R.I.C. has bad time to die down, ex-members of the R.I.C. will find           it  exceedingly hard,  if not  impossible, to find employment in Ireland.           It  is  desirable, therefore,  that some adjustment of the pension should be           made to tide those men who remain in Ireland over this critical period.1.  Disturbance Allowance.    In the cases in which disturbance allowance is required,  it will be requiredimmediately on,  or even before, disbandment, and it will not be possible,  therefore,to arrange that  every claim should be considered and approved before payment ismade.    In these circumstances it is suggested that the allowance should be immediatelypayable, without question, on application being made for it by any disbanded memberof the Force.  The allowance so  paid  will be regarded as an advance repayable outof pension unless and until the Tribunal referred to above has satisfied  itself thatthe man has, in  fact, removed; on being satisfied of this, the Tribunal may awardthe whole  or a part of the advance as a non-repayable disturbance allowance. -    As regards the form which the allowance is to take, it is suggested that it shouldbe made  as an extension of full  pay for varying periods one months  pay for  asingle man, two  months&apos; pay for  a married  man with less than three  children,  andthree months&apos; pay for a married man with three children or more.  It should be paid as a lump sum and simultaneously with the pension (the first payment of Avhich will,as usual, be in advance).    The Tribunal ought not, it  is suggested,  to  be  required to enquire into thenecessity or otherwise of a man&apos;s  removal, but merely to satisfy itself that he has infact removed.  In assessing the  amount of the allowance, all  reasonable expensesactually incurred should be taken into account.    Applications for disturbance allowance should not be entertained after the lapse of six months from the  date of disbandment.    The effect of these proposals  will be :     (a.) Any man who thinks it necessary  to remove his home will be  entitled to           receive,  on application within six months from the date of his disband-           ment, a lump sum, in addition to  pension, equivalent to one. two, or three           months&apos; pay.    (b.) He will be informed that so much of this sum as is not actually expended on           the reasonable costs of removal will be repayable by deductions  made from           his pension.    (c.) The Tribunal will be informed of  all payments so made.    (d.) Within two months of the payment of the money, the man must submit to           the Tribunal evidence that  he has in fact removed, and of the cost of           his removal.     (e.) If the Tribunal is satisfied that the man has in fact removed, it will write           off so much of the sum advanced to him as in all the circumstances appears           to be reasonable.     (/.) If the man does not submit evidence of his  removal within two  months, or           if the  Tribunal is not satisfied  that he  has in  fact removed,  or  is of           opinion that the reasonable expenses of  removal are less  than the  sum           which has been advanced to him,  they will direct the Pensions Issue Office           to recover the whole or a part (as the case may be) of the sum so paid      [8025]                                                         B 2
           by deductions  from the man&apos;s pension.   The  amount of the deduction           to be made, which should not exceed 50 per cent, nor be less than 10 per           cent, of the pension, should be such as the Tribunal, on consideration of           all the circumstances of the case, may determine.2. Provision for Cases of Persons in Exceptional Danger.    The arrangements  outlined  in  the foregoing  paragraph  are  intended to be independent  of and ancillary to  the proposal contained  in the Report, dated the23rd December, 1921,  of  Sir John Anderson&apos;s Sub-Committee, where the view  is expressed that,  &apos;&apos; Special consideration would appear to be due to  Irish memberscompelled to quit the country or to remove to a new locality.  It is suggested that a standing Tribunal  should be constituted with power to award additional compensa-tion to such members according to the circumstances of each case.&quot;    This proposal received the general approval of the Cabinet when CP. 3601, ofwhich it formed Appendix C, was under consideration.3. Provision of a Living  Wage during  the &quot; Unemployable Period.&quot;    To meet the second point referred to above, it is considered that what is required is not an addition  to the pension, but a readjustment of it,  so as to provide for thepayment during, say, two years after disbandment  of a larger pension, with com-compensating deduction during the remainder of the currency of  the pension; and  itis suggested that the best  way of  providing this is by the commutation of a limitedportion of the pension, the capital sum thus obtained being issued in the form of an addition to  the pension during the first two years.    If such  a commutation is approved in principle, it will  clearly  have to be confined  within narrow limits.    It is suggested :     (a.)  That commutation  should only be allowed in cases where the applicant  is           in receipt of a pension of less  than 35/60* of the maximum pay of his           rank, i.e., in  the case of officers  and  men of less than fifteen years&apos;           service.    (b.)  That only  such commutation should be allowed as will  increase the pension           for a period of two years to  a maximum of 35/60* of the maximum pay           of the applicants rank, and as will not reduce the pension payable during           the remainder of the applicants life to less than   52 per annum.    (c.)  That only such commutations should be effected by the Pensions Commutation           Board as are recommended to them by the Tribunal.  In order, however,           to avoid delay, the Pensions Issue Office  should be authorised  to  issue           to any applicant not disqualified under (a) above such temporary increase           in pension as will bring his pension up to a total of  30/60 of the pay he           was receiving  immediately  before  disbandment, such  payment  to  be           provisional and in anticipation of the recommendation of the Tribunal.    (d.)  That recruits enlisted in  Great Britain during the last two years should not          be eligible for  the special commutation proposals HOAV put forwrard.    It is not believed that the number of men who would apply for commutation forthis purpose would be large.  After deducting the  British recruits,  the number ofmen remaining does not exceed 8,000, and of these probably not less than 30 per cent.will be in receipt  of a  pension exceeding 35/60 of  their maximum pay.  Of theremaining 5,600 a proportion may be expected to take advantage of the assistance towards emigration referred to below, while it may be anticipated that others, either with or without taking advantage  of the disturbance allowance, will be able to obtainimmediate employment in another Police Force (especially in Northern  Ireland) or elsewhere.    The only burden finally imposed on the Exchequer by this scheme will be thatarising out of cases (which will be rare) in which men, having  commuted a portionof their  pension, subsequently obtain employment in a Police  Force, so that  their pensions are suspended.   In these cases the abatement  of  subsequent  pensionresulting on commutation  will not operate during the period of suspension.    It is believed  that the proposals  suggested  above will go far to  satisfy thedemands of the Representative Bodies  in so far as those demands are based on the necessities of the situation.                       * 30/50 if the pension is calculated in fiftieths.          / * ;
                               SUPPLEMENT.Summary of Proceedings at Interviews of Representative Bodies  with the Chief        Secretary, February 6, 7 and 8, 1922, at the Irish Office, London.                            Outline of Proceedings.    THE Representative Bodies (officers and men) of the Royal Irish Constabularyattended at the Irish Office, London, on the 6th, 7th and 8th February, 1922,  and placed before the Chief Secretary  certain pleas  for  his and the Governmentsconsideration, arising out of the impending disbandment of the Forces.    The Chief  Secretary (accompanied by Sir John  Anderson,  Mr. Whiskard,Mr.  Hemming and  Captain Darling), personally  received the Deputation.   TheRepresentative Bodies were  introduced by  Mr. Edward  Burne and Mr. Riordan,their legal  advisers.    The Representative Bodies claimed,  in addition to the compulsory  disbandment of the  Force plus twelve years&apos; added service :     (a) A  further concession of six years&apos; full pay as compensation for  loss of office;           and    (b) A  bonus for  loyal service to enable  individuals to make  a fresh  start in life.    These  proposals the Chief Secretary heard argued in detail, and  almost everyindividual  member of the Deputation  spoke in  support of some aspect or other ofthem.    A summary of the  arguments advanced by the  members  of the representative bodies follows.    On the conclusion of the Conference, the Representative  Bodies  thanked theChief  Secretary for  the patient  and careful  consideration he had given to their claims, which he undertook to bring  to the  notice of  the Cabinet Committee  dealingwith the Disbandment of the Force.   He gave  the Representatives to understand,however, that, so far as the general  terms  of disbandment are  concerned, these arethe final decisions of the Government, and that, moreover, they are, by comparison,the most generous terms ever granted by a Government to a body of  public servants,compulsorily retired  at  their own  request.  Although the Pensions granted to theForce are based on the highest rate of Police pay (a rate  the reduction of which isnow actually under consideration), in view  of  the  unique service  rendered by theR.I.C., the Chief Secretary held that such a generous scale  of Pensions  was fully justified.  The Chief Secretary promised the fullest and most sympathetic considera-tion of all  special cases  and assured the Representative Bodies that,  the tribunal which would consider these, would be  one on which the Force  could place absolutereliance.  Men who,  because of their service to the  Crown, were in special danger,would receive  assistance  in resettlement either in Great Britain or  Overseas.    The  problem of  the general return of the  R.I.C. to  civil  life  is one which isreceiving careful attention, and, in view of the generally expressed  opinion  that no member of  the R.I.C. would be safe in Ireland after disbandment (a view the Chief      [8025]                                                         B 3    The question of the commutation of a portion of the pension in the case of menwho desire to take  advantage of the opportunities  for emigration which are being developed has already been brought before the Committee.  The arrangements whichit is hoped to make  with the Dominion  Governments and with organisations such asthe C.P.R. are not yet sufficiently complete to enable them to be brought to the noticeof the men.   It is clear, however, that  if and when  any advantageous arrangementsfor emigration are made,  the men must be  required to avail themselves of them, ifthey desire to do so, within a limited period, and that men who do avail themselves of them should  not  be  eligible for  either of the  concessions  suggested above.Conversely,  men  who avail  themselves  of  either of these  concessions cannot  beregarded as eligible for any  special  facilities  for emigration,  unless  they agree torefund any money advanced to them by way of  disturbance  allowance or increasedpension.    Irish Office, February 1922.
Secretary personally declined to accept), the immediate consideration of resettlementin Canada  and Australia under schemes now being prepared was urged on all whofelt apprehensive about their future.  The difficulty which men might experience ininducing their  wives to leave  Ireland was recognised,  but the Delegates admitted that this must  be a matter for individual decision.   The Delegates emphasised, inconclusion, their anxiety for rapid  disbandment,  and pressed for a date when theForce would cease to be, it being felt that its continued existence as-a formed bodyadded to the risks and dangers of all concerned.  Arguments in su-pport of a Claim for Special Compensation on the ground  that       no  Member  of the R.I.C.  can be  Safe in Ireland after Retirement.    1. Constables shot since the Truce.  (Sergeant Enwright at Kilmallock.  Bally-bunion shooting.  Lisdoonvarna shooting, &amp;c).    2. Constables on leave have been kidnapped since the Truce.    3. Constables have been abused, threatened and insulted in the streets since the truce.    4. Families of Police  have  been threatened with  eviction since  the  Truce(Callan, Kilkenny, case).    5. Children of Policemen have been insulted at school.  (Limerick C.C. Jlesolu-tion declaring children of members  of the R.I.C. ineligible for scholarships under that Council).    6. Wife of a Police Officer, who was  a school mistress, had the school  under hercharge boycotted,  with the result that the  school was closed.  (It was suggested thatthis Police Officer&apos;s wife  lost  her employment in consequence,  but this was not definitely maintained.)    7. Individual.,members of  the I.R.A. have sworn vengeance  against  individualPolicemen who, peace or no peace,  believe that they will not be forgotten for thewrork they did in the R.I.C.  (Wicklow representative  gave an account of a conversa-tion he heard in a railway carriage since the Truce, in which he  alleges a  civilian evidently a member of the  I.R.A. mentioned the names of Policemen as being&quot;marked.&quot;)     A rguments in support of a Flea for the payment  of a Lump Sum Down                              on Disbandment.    1. Men- owing to the times have not  saved much.    Married men  especiallyhave had to maintain two establishments,  and the boycott even in a modified  way has added to the general cost of living.  Single men engaged in dangerous work have not in the majority of cases saved money.    2. It will be necessary  in a number  of  cases for policemen  on disbandment tomove  from their  present houses and districts.   Houses are difficult to  obtain inIreland or Great Britain.  Cost of  removal is  heavy,  and for ex-R.I.C. whenpossible at  all it will be specially costly, and there is a risk that the property maybe damaged, or indeed totally destroyed, by evilly-disposed persons.    3. A olea  is put  forward  for the payment of an allowance  for disturbance tothe whole Force on  the grounds that removal is necessary in the majority of cases,that  it will be costly, and that members of the R.I.C. will be faced with this heavyoutlay immediately on  disbandment,  when they have  a reduced income and noexpectations of employment.    4. If the general payment of a lump sum to each man as a Disturbance allowance is impossible, a plea is entered for some method of increasing the dispersal advancefrom Pension or commuting a  portion of  the Pension to tide the ex-members of theForce over the  first two years  following  disbandment, which would be admittedlythe most difficult period for all who being young men have to  seek a new  career.  Argument in favour of a Plea that One Month&apos;s Pay be given on Disbandment.    The disbandment has come suddenly,  and men have little ready money available.The difficulties  for an ex-Policeman will be many.   No employment is immediatelypossible.   Pension is admittedly not sufficient to live on.   Some men  have  been unable to save  anything.    An advance  of   10  on Pension is  inadequate, besideshampering  the ex-Constable&apos;s future by necessitating  repayment.  One month&apos;s pay would do something to tide  over immediate difficulties.
                                APPENDIX.                                      I.                   MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE.[Jnder-Secretary,    I FORWARD a proposal for a final settlement for the R.I.C.   I am of opinionthat the conditions in Ireland are now proving that in a great many parts it would be extremely unsafe  for members who are  disbanded from the R.I.C.  to live.   It istherefore essential that Irish members of  the Force receive a gratuity sufficient toenable them to move to places where they can live in safety.    As  regards the Black and Tans. In  view  of the gratuities given to the  Irishmembers, I think  it just that they should be given a gratuity of  10 per head, thatis to say, that the  10 which they were allowed to draw on  disbandment should notbe recovered from their pension.   The  effect of such recovery would simply  be to force them into Avant, whereas their pension, if left intact, could save them  fromabsolute penury.    For the Irish members I propose two weeks&apos; pay for each actual complete year&apos;service,  with  a minimum of  25 for single men and  50 for married men,v and amaximum of  one  years pay.  Allowances to be disregarded.  The pay  of rank tobe calculated  on  the scale  of  pay on which the pension under  the settlement is    Argument in support of Plea for Special Compensation for Loss of Office.    1.&quot; Under the 1914 Act the Force remained an Imperial &quot;Reserved &quot; service for six years.  Under the Disbandment Terms no such period of &quot; Reserved &quot;  service isobtainable, and some payment is asked for in lieu of this forfeiture of six years offully-paid service, during which time, it is-argued,  men having the right to retirevoluntarily on modified Pension, they would have had a better chance of securingre-entry into civil employment.    2. The addition of twelve years&apos;  service  and compulsory disbandment under thepresent terms, deprives members of the Force of six  years&apos; full  pay in their presentranks, and some compensation for this deprivation is sought.Arguments in support of a Plea for Special Compensation on the ground that no    Member of  the R.I.C. can secure  Employment after Disbandment in Ireland    (and, elsewhere).    1. Action of Limerick  tqwn tenants in declining to pay rents to collectors whowere lately members of the  R.I.C.    2. Further  police employment is generally distasteful  to  the  majority of themembers of  the Force, even if it  were available.   (Belfast  delegate  expressedapprehension as  to the Northern Force, and suggested that old R.I.C. would not findservice in that Force at all  congenial.  This delegate considered that the R.I.C. asan Imperial Force had an  independence and lack of bias which he was of opinion the new force would not have.)    3. Delegate representing British  recruits (1920-21 enlistments) stated thatcertain Trade Unions had  passed resolutions against R.I.C.,  and that,  especiallyin the engineering trade (to which this delegate belonged) this would prove a bar to employment.  (Delegate was unable to name the Trade Unions.)            Arguments advanced regarding  Commutation of Pensions.    1. Failing a lump sum payment on disbandment, some arrangement wherebymembers of  the Force might commute a portion of their pensions was sought.    2. Delegates  held  that  the older members  of the Force  would  not seekcommutation, but  younger  men, especially  young District-Inspectors, are anxiousto commute.    3. Delegates representing British enlistments held that   10 Dispersal payment was inadequate for men seeking to re-establish themselves in Great Britain.  He saidthat  20 should  be the minimum, but was opposed to this sum being deducted fromPension at all.  He claimed  compensation  payment in excess of any Pension, and supported the general demand for  a lump  sum on  disbandment to  all R.I.C.  ascompensation for loss of office and to  enable men to make a fresh start in life.
calculated.  In the case of temporary rank, for the purpose of the bonus only thistemporary rank  will count as if it were permanent rank; for instance, a Constableof one year&apos;s service will be treated as if his rate of pay were that of a Constable ofthirteen  years&apos; service.   Similarly, a Temporary  County  Inspector  will  receivebonus as  a  County Inspector of twelve or more years&apos;  standing.    This generoustreatment as regards bonus  of  the  temporary ranks will obviate  any necessity ofincreasing the  pension of members of the Force who have held  temporary rank.The Divisional Commissioner, for example, will be pensioned on the highest rate of pay of a County Inspector.   He will be given a bonus calculated on two weeks&apos;  pay as Divisional Commissioner;  therefore, a Divisional Commissioner of twenty-fouryears&apos; service and  upwards  will receive one year&apos;s  pay ( 1,200) as bonus.    Thisbonus to  be subject to the  following conditions :   In the case of men,  includingOfficers,  residing in Ireland during a period  of twelve  months following date ofdisbandment, or taking service in any Police Force in the British Isles, the gratuityto be reduced to half the foregoing.   Any overpayment made to be repayable by theindividual concerned, or, failing such repayment, to be  deducted from pension, or,in the case  of men taking service in  a Police Force in  the British Isles, deducted from pay.   The above minimum of  25 for single men and  50 for married men willbe an absolute minimum in all cases.   In view of the payment of this gratuity no payment  will be made  for  removal expenses consequent on  disbandment,  except possibly in very special cases.     The entire  scheme is therefore pension  plus gratuity calculated as above.   Iwould urge the great importance of coming to an immediate decision on this point.The Representative Body maintain  that members of the Force cannot in safety live in Ireland, and therefore should get a gratuity.  As you are aware,  they are bringingpolitical pressure to bear.   I would submit that it is far better for the Governmentto  decide on a  full and adequate provision,  rather than  appear  to be  forcedgrudgingly by political pressure into conceding demands piecemeal.     A. calculation is being made of  the total cost of this proposal and will be wiredacross to-morrow.     The chief advantage of this scheme is that it recognises length of service andrank and also treats generously men  who have borne the responsibilities of temporaryrank.   This scheme has been discussed with the D.I.G. and the A.I.G. and also-Avith the A.U.S., and the opinion is that it is a fair proposal for final settlement ofthe R.I.C., and will obviate the necessity of the almost impossible task of going intoa multitude of individual claims.     One  special provision I think should be made,  and that is the case  of GeneralBarron and Colonel Wickham.*   I  recommend they be treated on the same terms asthe  Commandant Auxiliary  Division, R.I.C., Colonel Wickham  to get half  therate as in the case of other Police Officers who joined the Northern or other police force.                                          H.  H. TUDOR,  Major-General,     Dublin Castle,                                   Chief of Police  (Ireland).         February  5, 1922.                                      II.         MEMORANDUM BY MR.  COPE, THE ASSISTANT UNDER-SECRETARY.    THE Chief of Police and I have worked out the folloAving scheme.   Briefly,it is as follows :           Constables to receive  9 for each completed year of actual service.         Sergeants  11 5s.         Head Constables  14.         District Inspectors              3rd class  17.             2nd class  20.             1st class  25.         County Inspectors  35.   *  Neither General Barron nor Colonel Wickham are regular K.I.C. officers.   General Barron, who isDivisional Commissioner, Limerick, is a retired army officer.  Colonel Wickham is  Divisional Commissioner,Belfast, and a regular soldier seconded for service with the 11.1.C.
    The payment of half the above rates to men who join up with the Police Forceof the North or South is very generous (over generous) if they are to get more than their pay in the new Police Force.  I understand that if they join the new Force theywill receive the pay of the new Force and their pensions will be suspended.   They willwork therefore for the difference between pay and pension.  If such is the case, then the half gratuity would compensate for removal expenses in some cases, but where no removal  is required it  would be  a  pure gift.  To  cut it out altogether would jeopardise  recruitment for the new Force.  There would  of course be no removalexpenses payable by any Government  to men  removing to England  or  taking  upduty with a new Force.    I do not agree with General Tudor as to Colonel Wickham.  He is carrying on with the North and  will advance his position.   His reward  should be the job he getsin the North.  It might be different if disbandment meant losing his job.  He should get &quot;nil.&quot;    As  to General Barron : He is  not placed in a similar  position  to  ColonelWickham.   His job goes.   Neither is he quite the same as General  Wood.*  Thelatter could have made a year&apos;s contract from the 20th October, 1921, had he been aCadet, or on the pay of a Cadet plus command  allowances, and I have recommended 400 to  cover unpaid Income Tax and to give him  200 to get away with.  He has nopension  of any sort.  General Barron, on the other hand, has a pension of  800 perannum from Army  Funds,  and there  was no mix-up about his contract.  He was clearly engaged on a month&apos;s notice. He had no more than four or five months of the fight and six months of the  truce.   He has lost  nothing and has no home in Ireland.I should have thought that  200, which is equal to two months&apos; pay, should meet his case Income Tax would of course  be payable.                                                             A.  W.  COPE.    Dublin  Castle,  February 5, 1922.                                     III.       LETTER FROM THE CHIEF OF POLICE TO THE CHIEF SECRETARY,  DATED                             FEBRUARY 24, 1922.My dear Chief Secretary,    I ATTACH a paper to show you the situation in which the police who remainin Ireland will be placed.    If Ireland were a normal country and the R.I.C. were subjected to no ill-feelingor victimisation, and could take their  chance of employment with anyone else, thenI think the terms cf the pension would be sufficiently fair and generous treatment tothe police.   I would point out that the Government have again and again pledgedfair and generous treatment, and, having regard to the fact that they were legallybound, owing to compulsory disbandment of the  Black and  Tans, to give the Blackand Tans compulsory  disbandment treatment laid down  in  the  1920  Act theycould  hardly give the Irish  constables less,  and though that disbandment was theleast the Government were obliged to do, having regard to their pledges in the 1920Act, as the police lose prospects of a steady, well-paid career, and have to start, inmany cases, in a new profession.  This, I consider,  is provided for by the terms ofthe pension, but, in view of the grave risk which any policeman will run in remaining in Ireland, I think the  Government are bound to do more.   Provided the scheme Ihave sent in  is approved, if a policeman remains in Ireland he does so at his ownrisk, and the Government have no further responsibility, whereas if the compensa-tion of the Force is limited to the pension,  the bulk of the  Force will be compelledto live in Ireland,  and the Government will be responsible  for any injury done tothem by their enemies, and will, moreover, be morally bound to provide compensationon a generous scale for their families if any one of them is murdered.    The question that I would press for immediate settlement is this : I am, as you know, concentrating the police into various centres.   There are many men who wouldbe in extreme danger if they stayed with their families, and  who consider that  their families are liable to molestation when the police leave; some of these wish to sendtheir families to England at once.  Can you get immediate sanction for any man whowants to send his wife and family to England to be granted removal expenses withthe minimum  of full fares to the place where they  would wish to go in England ?* General Wood was Commandant A.I)., R.I.C.. and is a retired officer of the regular army without pension.
I am sure you feel equally as strongly as I do that we cannot abandon members ofthe R.I.C. to struggle in Ireland under  very adverse conditions when the provision..of a little money would enable them to  get out of the country.  I  hope you  willcontinue to do your utmost to get the most generous terms possible.    The scheme I sent in will, I firmly believe, meet with general approval.  I drewit up in consultation with Cope, the D.I.G.  and A.I.G., and I  gather that theRepresentative Body would be prepared to accept it, though I have not been able, ofcourse, to  tell them the details.  If the Treasury still take the line that nothing morecan be done, cannot you go to the Prime Minister direct 1                                                    Yours sincerely,                                                            H. H.  TUDOR,    Dublin Castle, February 24, 1922.                  ENCLOSURE REFERRED TO BY GENERAL TUDOR.General Tudor,    Chief of Police, Dublin.Sir,                                               Belfast, February 21, 1922.    I BEG to address you on a matter of serious importance, having been advised bya personal friend here who holds a high position in the R.I.C.  For over two years past I have been Crime Special Sergeant at--, Co.---, and, without beingegotistical, I have had some fine cases here, including a death sentence in the famous--ambush,  and the  arrest of a Roman Catholic priest who was giving  a gooddeal of trouble.    -was  handed over to the I..R.A. on the  5th instant, and the previous day(Sunday) an attack was made  upon me from the pulpit by the parish priest.  this attack, I am informed, was of the vilest nature, and, as there were only eight  R.I.C.men left  in the barracks, and the fact that over 100 I.R.A.  had taken up quarters in---Castle, which Auxiliaries had evacuated a few weeks previous, the wonderis that I was not murdered as a result of this &quot; sermon.&quot;   HoAvever,  I got away withConstable &quot;X&quot;  at an early hour to M--town and thence to Belfast.   On theclay I left I made application for a van to convey my furniture from Church  Street,-- , to Belfast, where I  have a home ready for my wife and four children, but,in spite of the fact that I  have &apos; phoned M t- . for information regarding thisapplication for the past ten days, not a particle of neAVS can I get.    My wife and children are warned that they are to  be thrown out on the street,because the house they live in was commandeered by the police authorities for my use.No one dare speak to  her, and I dare not go within miles of the place.    The position, Sir, is most critical; she has everything ready for despatch, andI cannot send a wan from here,  for it Avould be burned.  M---Station,  I have beeninformed,  is being  handed over  to-morrow, and my  leave  terminates  on  the27th instant.     I beg you to give instructions to have a van sent down,  for the case is one ofpeculiar delicacy.     In conclusion, I humbly apologise &quot;for troubling you.                     I remain,                            Your faithful and obedient servant,                                                          X. Y. Z., Sergeant.     P.S. The  above address or the Barracks will find me.                                                                    X Y. Z.                                     IV.  LETTER, DATED FEBRUARY 13, 1922, CIRCULATED TO LANDLORDS AT DROMAHAIR,                                 Co. LEITRIM.Sir,                              *             Dromahair, February 13, 1922.    I AM instructed by the members of the Breffni 0&apos;Rourke Sinn Fein Club to for Avar d you a copy of resolution adopted unanimously  at their meeting held on the12th proximo :                                    Resolution.    Any person or persons harbouring &quot; Black and Tans &quot; on or after disbandmentshall be brought under public opinion immediately.
  REPORT, DATED FEBRUARY 22, 1922, RECEIVED FROM COUNTY INSPECTOR,  SLIGO,        SHOWING HOSTILITY OF LOCAL I.R.A. TO MEMBERS OF THE R.I.C.                                                   Sligo,  February 22, 1922.    I beg to report to you that the Managing Director, Collooney Woollen Mills,informed me yesterday that he received a communication  from the I.R.A. to thefollowing effect :         &quot;We understand that you have employed Sergeant Humphreys  in your    mills if so, you will  dismiss him at once.  No member of the R.I.C. must be    employed by you in any capacity whatever.  We will see to this.&quot;    There was a rumour current in Collooney that Sergeant Humphreys was getting a clerical post in the Collooney Mills.  There was no foundation for  this rumourbeyond the fact that I know Sergeant Humphreys  was  keen to get a post in thefactory, and I know that the owners of the mills  were anxious to employ him if hesuited their  office.  But in view of this letter from the I.R.A. the firm are afraid tooffer any members of the R.I.C. employment, and, in fact, are not disposed to considerapplications for employment from any members of the R.I.C. lest  their mills shouldbe burned, or else their trade boycotted.    This case goes to show what little chance members  of the R.I.C.  will have  of getting employment in this country after disbandment, and the treatment that will bemeted out to them at the hands of the I.R.A.o                                  Secondly.    Any landlord having a house to let cannot let a house to an ex-policeman so longas there is a native of the district wanting it and willing to pay a reasonable rent forsame.  Copies to be sent to all landlords in the town.                            I am, Sir, yours respectfully,                                          THOMAS McGIVNEY, Secretary.
