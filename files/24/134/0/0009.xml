THjQOjWMWT IS THB PROPERTY OF HIS BEITATOO majesty^S&apos; GOVERNMENT.cum s T.Mamorandum by the Minister,&quot; of .Lab.our.S.*           Slngineeriag and National Employers1 Federation gaveJ09,   notice on 23rd  February to the Amalgamated Enginesring Union      of a lock-out to begin on Maroh 11th.   The Immediate cause of      this decision was the rejeotlon on the ballot-vote of an agree-      ment reached between the Federation end the Amalgamated      Engineering Union  executive on the 18th February 1921,  with      regard to managerial functions and in particular relation to      overtime.  The agreement is:-                            1.  GSmKRAL.        &quot;1. The Trade Union shall not interfere with the right of            the Employers to &quot;exercise managerial functions in their            establishments and the Federations shall not interfere            with the proper functions of the Trade Union.         2, In the exercise of these fanetions, the parties shall            have regard to the provisions for Avoiding Disputes of            17th April, 1914, which are amplified by the Shop Stewards            and Works Committee Agreement of 20th May,1919, and to the            terms of other National and Local Agreements between the            parties.         3, Instructions of the Management shall be observed pending            any question in connection therewith being discussed in            accordance with the Provisions referred to.                2. OVERT1MB.   It is agreed that in terms of the Overtime and night shift Agreement of  9th and 30th September ,1920, theEmployers have the right to decide when overtime isnsoeseary. the workpeople or their representatives beingentitled to bring forward under the Provisions referredto any oases of overtime they desire discussed.  Meantime,the overtime required shall be proceeded with&quot;.
     The question of managerial&quot;functions and  overtime  is related to the long history of the Shop Stewards movement  andto the negotiations with regard to working  conditions  afterthe Armistice.   after the settlement of the 47 hour week  byagreement in December, 1918, various conferences took place,and in February, 1920 the employers offered an advance  inovertime rates provided that In consultation with the workpeoplethey could Institute payment by results.   The General  LabourUnions accepted these proposals, but in a ballot taken  by  the&amp;.S.S. the proposal for payment by results was defeated.   after some delay, partly due to the formation of the       negotiations were continued, and in September 1920, an agreement, laterconfirmed by ballot, ;vas made in relation to overtime and  night-shift payment.  The employers no longer insisted that overtimepayment and payment by results should bo considered together.She significant clause on the restriction of overtime was  to  the  .of foot that systematic -o ve rtimo was to be deprecated as a methodof......production and that when overtime was necessary no workmanahouId......be re au i re d to work more than 30 hours overtime in any weeks,.....and that ovortime should i not Jae^ restricted^ in the case.......ofbreakdowns,^repairs, etc.     Difficulties of interpretationarose in certain districts owing to District Committees claimingthe right to veto overtime and from May to November 1921negotiations proceeded.   During these the employers made itclear that no other questions, including that of manning of machines, would be discussed until this on9 was settled.  Theyinsisted that the question was whether the management is entitledonly to act after obtaining the prior consent of the shop stewards and District Committees, or whether the Management is entitled to manage, leaving any questions arising to be dealtwith by subsequent consultation as provided in  &quot;Provisions for
Avoiding Disputes11, the work in question hoing meantimeprooeodod with.  The Employers have no desire to ohange their position with regard to the reoognition of the Official shop stewards and District Ooincittees so long as their 1 unctionsare exercised within the scope-of the National agreements.     Tho intention of the November agreement, therefore,  isto make it clear that, while District Committees have aright under previous agreements to raise overtime or other questions, the instructions of the Management must be obeyedpending discussion by the agreed proooduro under tho national agreements.,     The Employers&apos; Moderations met the A.5.U. on the 28thFebruary but no basis of agreement was reached.   Later theNational Federation of General Workers, the Federation of engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and the National Union ofFoundry Workers met the Employers1 Federation and are now con-suiting their affiliated Unions with a view to a further meeting during the present week.   Yesterday the A.E.U. mettheir district organisers.   I have this morning met adeputation from the Executive Council and District Organisersof the A.BaU* and have arranged for a moating between them andthe Employers1 Federation tomorrow.  I propose this afternoon to meet employers1 representatives.                              (Sgd)  T. Jo M&amp;CNAMARA.Ministry of Labour,   7th March, 1922.
