SECRET.            CABINETCP. 3899,DISTRIBUTION OF 0 ABUTS T PAP35S.    2oto &quot;by the Secretary, (Sea also CP. 3023 and 3083 A).     The organisation for the  distribution  of CabinetPepors, which is based cn arrangements made  in the  days of the War Cabinet and has been  only slightly amendedsince, has recently &quot;been carefully re-examined in theCabinet Office with the result that certain  modificationsare now proposed.     Under the existing arrange meats, when  additionalcopies besides the copy xor the  Minister  at  the  head of theDepartment are required for departmental  use,  these aresent direct from the Cabinet Office to the  officer  concerned,e.g. the First Sea lord, the Chief  of the Imperial  GeneralStaff, Chief of the Air Staff, Under-Secretary for  ForeignAffairs, Treasury officials, e c.   During  ths War, whenhours and almost minutes counted, this was unavoidable.     tIn future&apos; it is proposed that  all copies  for departmentaluse shall be sent from the Cabinet  Office to the Ministerat the head of the Department, who will be  responsible  fordistributing them at his discretion to such officers of his department as are concerned.   For  example,  copies  of  Cabins rPapers for Treasury officials  will  be sent  to the  Chancellorof the Exchequer, those for the  First Sea Lordj  Chief of theImperial General Staff,&apos;Chief  of the Air  Staff,  UnderSecretary-for Foreign Affairs,  to the First  juo&amp;d.,Secretary of State far War, .Secretary of  State for  Air,Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs etc, each  Minister
making his own. arrangements for  their  distribution withinbis Department,     This arrangement will simplify  fas  work  of  firstxibufcionwithin the Cabinet Secretariat and is  based  on a logicalprinciple, namely, that the Secretary  commvrnicat es only with members of the Cabinet or  with Ministers mho aro notin the Cabinet and who receive certain Papers.   Under theproposed system the distribution lists will be lesscomplicated than at present;  and less ^clerical vtork. willbe required.  For example the sealing  up of copies indouble envelopes for Departmental officials who have  noCabinet key will be avoided.     As regards the Minutes, Memoranda,  etc,  of cabinet committees, it ia proposed to adept  the  same  principle,that is to say, the Secretary of the Committee willcommunicate direct to the members of the Committee,   Ifthe Departmental representative  on the Committee requiresmore than one copy for use In the Department,  the additionalcopies will be sent to him direct for  commnnication by himto the of floors of his Department whom he  wishes to consult     It is proposed to &quot;bring this arrangement intooperation as from Monday April 3rd.                             f SIGNED),.
