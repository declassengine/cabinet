Iffil/DRANDUIvi BY THE HOME SECRETARY.     It has been necessary to introduce a Bill - Representation of the people : (uo.  2) Bill - to continue the scheme  of registration dates which si nee 191*3 have been  instituted mrier- emergency powers now  coming tc ail enci. On the Seocnd Reading of this Bill - which, is  expected  to  be taken  next Wednesday   the  question of an Annual Register is sure  to be raised and it is desirable  that the  Government should be able to  state  their policy.      On the  15th November,  1920,  Mr.  Bonar Lav.  stated  in reply to a  Question that In view of  the large  saving  likely to  result, tho Government would  be  glad to see adopted the  proposal&apos;for  one  register  instead of two and  &quot;if it oomraends itself generally to the  House,  they  would be  prepared to introduce legislation accordingly as soon as  possible.      Subsequently 270 Members  declared  thecselves  in favour of an Annual Register and&apos; on the  24th February,  1921, pr.  Addison,  The Minister of Health,  circulated to the  Cabinet a  memorandum  on  the subject  (c.P.2618).  This was considered at the                  3 44L - Cabinet Meeting of 4;th March,  1921,  (Cabinet  Minute  10(2l)(3)),  and the Minister ms asked to  obtain the views  of the Government  Whips.      The late  ohief Unionist 7/hip reported in favour of  the change.   The  late chief Liberal Whip  stated- that the proposal  would meet with almost unanimous  opposition from Coalition Liberals.   The present Whips who  were  subsequently  consulted ex- pressed precisely  the same views as their predecesors.  It  is understood  that the Independent Liberal and  Labour Parties will strongly  oppose  the  change.     The mai.n ^nsiderat ions to be borne In mind are these     1. The  system of two Registers was introduce!  by tho  Representation of the People  Act, .1918,     following the recommendations  of the  Speaker&apos; 3&apos; Oonf erenow * Previously one Register a  year was prepared,     2. General Elections during the  last fifteen years  have always takep place luring  the period  covered&apos;  by the present Autumn Register  and aH. ordinary ...  .elections of  Icoai authorities take plane during  the same period.     But., of  oourse, bye-elections takw place outside that  period and  there is nothing to prevent,a General Ele.oti.on being held during the  Spring Register  period.     3,&apos; The effect of substituting one Register for two  wotild be  to defer, the toolufdnn,&apos; on  the Register: for a constituency, of&quot; electors who have removed&apos;t?&apos; that 0^nstit&apos;:enoy and of persons newly qualified.   In the event  of an election  during&apos;the Spriug Register period, the former  could vote in their  old  sonstitnenoy only:the latter *o*vjd not vote at all.   The  extent  to which this  consideration would operate is indicated by the fact that the hewhamen included  in any half-yearly
  gi-Jtbr arc- on an average 5 to  5)&apos;$ of tho total electorate,  the proportion varyirisubstantially in different areas, e.g. in Islington the new nameB are over 10,00Con a total electorate of -155.000.      4.  A+&apos; the tiittJ when Mr. Bonar Law made the statement quoted above,it hac beer alleged that the saving due to substituting one or two Registerswould amount tc   700,000      At the present  time  the yearly  cost  of  the  two Registers  has  beenreduced and it  is  estimated  to amount to   995,000 ( 640,000  for compilationand  355,000 for prining)  of which  half falls on  the rates and  half on  theExohcquer;  and the aotual saving whioh may be  oxponted  in Present  circumstances could not exceed  303,000  per prnunu   Indeed, it  is probably  that the ohange  would preclude the continuance .of  the present *oonomioal method  of  publishing  theElectors Lists*.      Should this  apprehension prove  well  founded, the estimated saving would bereduced below  250,000 apart from any risk of higher &apos;printi ng oharges to mewtthe seasonal character of  the new work.      The Geddes Committee in their Third  Report  abstain  from expressing an opinion on the  question of an Annual-Register but make another  suggestion with aview to cheapening the cost  of the  Second  half-yearly Register.  This suggestionis that tho supplementary lists of  turn es which  are prepared  and printed everyhalf year at;, part  of  the Electors Lists should  be substituted as an effectivesupplementary Register for  one. of the  complete Registers each year and that  ih ere-by a saving of   35,000 could be effected... There  are however practical  difficultiesin carrying out the suggestion in its entirety  and probably  any soh-:oe  on theselinos would only save  40,000 or  45,000 at the outside.      If the Cabinet  decide  in favour of an Annual Register  I would, propose on theSecond Reading  of  the Representation  of tho People Bill to announoc that legis-,lation for this purpose will be introduced later.  The effect of Buch legislation would be to abolish tho Spring Register in 1923 and subsequent  years and thereby3ave a sum which cannot exceed  &apos;3O0,O0C and uiay bo loss than  250,000 each  year.      If the Cabinet  dooide  against Ahe Annual  Regis ter,  I will explore further the possibilities  of  a scheme for a Supplementary Register on the lines of  thesuggestion made by the Goddes Committee,, but it is unlikely  that the saving   &quot; ,,,,resultihg from  such a scheme would  amount  to  45,000,                                                        E* S.  23rd March, 1922.he Electors&apos; Lists are the provisional Register prepared by the Registrationffiber as a result of his canvass, eto, and are bublished to give an opportunity&apos;or tlaima and objections to be made beforothe final Register *e. printed off. Atne time the Electors&apos; Lists and the final Register of eaoh hal^yearly beoasionere separately printed throughout: but in 19w the present metnod was institutedf publishing composite Electors1 Diets-consisting of (a) the previous half-yearly;egister, [bj a lj.pt of additions, and  (a) a list of deletions.  After olnims.rid objections have been dealt with on  the composite Electors&apos; Lists the threeists are combined in a final clean Register,
