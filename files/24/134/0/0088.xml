[This Document is the Property of His-Bntannic Msjestys Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1922.SECRET:CP.  3889.                                                        3CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.             MEMORANDUM  BY THE CHIEF  SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.    I SUBMIT, for the consideration of the Cabinet, my survey for the week ended the 20th instant.                       GENERAL  STATE OF THE  COUNTRY.    With the entire withdrawal of the Royal Irish Constabulary from nineteen outof the twenty-six counties of Southern Ireland, and their  concentration in one or twocentres in each of the remaining seven counties, the main source of official informa-tion in regard to current events outside Dublin is now dried up, and  it is no longer possible to measure, week by  week,  with any approach to scientific accuracy, theincrease or diminution in the  total amount of lawlessness throughout the country.This comparison has, of course, been a matter of increasing difficulty and uncer-tainty for several weeks as the evacuation of the police has proceeded, and I  have nodoubt that a number of the minor crimes and acts of petty persecution  which occur inthe evacuated districts do not come to light.  Making due allowance, however, forthe incompleteness  of  newspaper reports and for the fact  that  these reports aresometimes biased and wilfully distorted, I am satisfied that  the conditions which nowprevail in Southern Ireland  are in the main faithfully presented in the press of thatcountry, and that such lurid accounts as that of Sir Henry Wilson, who depicts thepresent  state of the twenty-six counties  as having been reduced by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to  a welter of chaos and murder, difficult to believe,  and impossible to describe,&quot; are widely removed from the actual facts of the situation.  On this subject would attach much greater weight and importance to  the opinion of Lord Mayo,who, writing with first-hand knowledge and personal experience, describes Sir HenryWilsohs allegations as untrue and as requiring  instant refutation.   The following extract from Lord Mayo&apos;s letter, published in the &quot; Irish Times &quot; of the 22nd  instant,gives a very fair and reliable pen-picture of the conditions under which ordinary lifeis now conducted throughout the greater part of Southern  Ireland :          &quot; In the South and the West the plough and the  harrow are at work, and    the agriculturists,  rich and poor, are taking every advantage  of  a fine and dry    spring.  The season of fox-hunting, hare-hunting  and stag-hunting is drawing    to a close one  of the best season&apos;s sport we  have experienced in  the South and    West.  Racing  is being carried on in the South and  West.  I read of successful    race meetings of sportsmen and point-to-point races.  In fact, high and  low are    taking their pleasure in  a legitimate manner.        &quot; History tells us that when  a revolution is ending there is always an after-    math of crime and disorder; but to state in the press that the twenty-six counties    of the South and West of Ireland &apos; are reduced to a welter of chaos and murder  &apos;    is not  correct.&quot;    I regret to state, however, that the  aftermath  of crime to which Lord Mayorefers still continues in the form of attacks which  have  all  the  appearance ofvendettas, upon members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and other Crown servants,who, in the course of their duties during the past two years, have been so unfortunateas to incur the  relentless private enmity of individuals or of the relatives of individual -duals who  suffered  imprisonment  or  other punishment under the  measures  then in  &apos;    [8122]
force for the suppression of crime and the restoration of law and order.  A series ofghastly tragedies, which can only be accounted for by the theory of private vengeance,was enacted in Galway City on the night of the 15th instant, when two sergeants ofthe Royal Irish Constabulary, who were lying dangerously ill in St. Bride&apos;s Home,were shot dead by a party of masked men,  and a constable, who was also a patient inthe same hospital, was fired at and dangerously wounded.  A retired  official of the congested Districts Board was shot dead in similar circumstances on the same night in another Galway hospital, to which  he  had recently been admitted for woundsreceived in a previous attempt upon his life.  It is known that one of the sergeantsand the ex-official of the Congested  Districts  Board had been  suspected of givinginformation, which led in one case to the arrest of a man, who was subsequently shotwhile attempting to escape from his escort, and in the other case to the search of thehouse of a prominent local Sinn Fein  leader, whose house was afterwards burned.The other sergeant had been awarded  the  Constabulary Medal  for gallantry in  anambush which took place about a year ago in the neighbourhood of Galway.  I am glad to state  that these terrible crimes aroused universal horror and indignationthroughout  the whole of Southern Ireland, and were  condemned in  the strongestterms by the Bishop of  Galway and  members of his clergy in sermons preached  onSt. PatriclCs Day. The Provisional Government have given an assurance that everyeffort will be made to trace and punish the murderers; but I fear that these effortswill not be effective.  During the period from the Truce to the Treaty  no member ofthe Regular R.I.C. was killed,  but five were wounded.  During  the period that has elapsed since the Treaty sixteen, including one pensioner, have been murdered, and forty, including one pensioner, have been wounded.  No one has been brought tojustice for these crimes.    Another attempted  murder of a policeman occurred  in Cork  City on the even-ing of the 17th instant.   This outrage was committed in a crowded street, the victimbeing dangerously wounded in the back by  two revolver shots fired at close range, butthere is no evidence to show whether the motive was that of private vengeance or thedesire to strike at the Provisional Government by involving them in a  breach of the amnesty recently granted to all members of the Crown Forces.   The  recent  violentdemonstrations on the part of the extreme Republicans  in Cork City suggest thelatter motive, which also obtains colour from an attack  made on  the same night by a republican patrol upon the local Parnell Guards Band, which had taken a prominentpart in Mr. Collins&apos;s demonstration of the preceding Sunday.  This attack, in which one of the bandsmen was shot  dead, was the subject of strong comments  in theNationalist press upon&apos; the policy and methods recently adopted by the  RepublicanParty.                         STATE OF THE POLICE  FORCES.     The disbandment of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Southern Ireland has been fixed for the 31st instant, but owing to difficulties created by the conditions at presentprevailing in Belfast and other parts of the Six  Counties Area, it has been decided on  the request of  the Northern Government to defer  disbandment  of the menstationed in the Six Counties until a later date, which, however, will not be later thanthe 31st May.  This postponement is not  viewed with  satisfaction by the men con-cerned, the majority of whom are Catholics, and are not desirous of  taking service with the Northern Government.     The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces :                            Royal Irish Constabulary.Strength on the 12th March,  1922      ...       ...      ...     8,705    Deaths during week      ...       ...       ...       2    Retirements      ...      ...       ...       ...      71    Resignations     ...      ...       ...       ...

                          Dublin Metropolitan Police.    The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged at 1,128throughout the week.                   PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN  IRELAND.    It is generally agreed that the violent speeches of Mr. de Valera and Mr.  CathalBrugha, and the still more violent tactics adopted by their followers during the part fortnight have not advanced the cause of the Republican Party, and that the positionof Mr. Collins and his colleagues is steadily gaining strength.  Not the least  signifi-cant indication of this tendency of public opinion is the fact that Mr. de Valera hasbeen driven to issuing  a letter to the press, in which he seeks to place an interpreta-tionupon  his speeches which diverts them  of  their plain meaning, and in effectamounts to a 2&apos;ecantation of their incitements to violence.  The firm stand taken byMr. Griffith in prohibiting the  holding of a Convention  of  the  Irish republican army has increased public confidence in the  determination  of the Free  State Partyto tolerate  no further  attempts to  defeat the Treaty by undemocratic methods, andalthough a section of the extremists have threatened to  hold a Convention in defiance of Mr. Griffith, it is unlikely that they will succeed in carrying with them more thana portion of the organisation.    A greater  danger to the position  of  the Provisional Government and  of theTreaty than the opposition of the Republican Party is the threatening situation nowdeveloping on the Northern border, and particularly in  Belfast.   This has already taken on several of  the aspects of civil war.                                                                      Ff. G.    Irish Offi.ce.
