CHURCHILIeConfidential.                 House of&apos; LordswReply to 21) Arlington wtreet,My dear Churchill,           You will be told hq-w we have put  off  the  3rdReading in this House till Monday          [This was of course done because  of the con-troversy over the Ulster month or rather the date  fromwhioh it is to be calculated,          I do not know whether you will allow me  to urge you to make a concession upon this.   Perhaps  ofcourse you have a reason which was. not disclosed in&apos;                                              debate
debate,  but no sufficient reason was put forwardhe re.           The concession does not contravene theTreaty.   On the contrary the best opinion is that theamendment inserted tonight by the Government is the realalteration of the Ircaty. . Neither would the concessionbe distasteful to the Provisional Oovornment.  Nor isit opposed by Midleton and his friends,  and I need not say Ulster is passionately anxious to get the date putback again to the passing of the present Bill.           I can conceive that (though this is not said)you have a hope that in the course of the next three orfour months Ulster will consent to come in. to an undividedIreland.   Po you really think there is the remotestchance?  I do not doubt the Irish will go on shooting eachother for the rest of the summer and all the more if thissore is kept open.   Indeed I am afraid you will not JLn anycase escape civil war, hut you may if you do not make, this concession, lose your last chance.  Lastly surely to keepthe inhabitants of large areas - indeed oven counties - insuspense cannot be justified.                  Yours very sincerely,                             (Sgd.) Salisbury.     I have not referred to Peal^s contention that Ulsteroannot contract out  of a Constitution not yet In existence *That, is, I presume,  merely a question of drafting and in anjcase not more anomalous than Article 10 in which a government-ment (not yet in existence.) contracts to make certainpayments.     We are dealing  with real points not drafting points.- Z -
                          IT.QYY OF LETTER FROM m.. GBXTRCHILL TO LORD SALISBURY...                                    Colonial Office-.,.                                       po.wn.ing  Street,  S.--.1..   &apos;.ifidential.                                         March  24th  1922.My.; dear Salisbury.,        Following on  our  interview, I. sent you  a  brief  note explaining our position  or  the point you raised. v-e. consider it essential that- the Ulster month should run  from  the Act completing the ratification of the Treaty and  the Constitution, and not from this present interim measure.  The  reasons are threefold:.&apos; (%) Th?  change  cannot be effected  without  very considerable alterations in the Treaty,, not only, in regard  to the Ulster month, but also  to the Boundary-&quot; Commission&apos;. It  would &apos;  &apos;- be absurd to offer Ulster an. option  with regard  to  a Constitution which she had not seen,  and a ^ree State which is not  in  existence. A Boundary Commission Implies a Commission appointed by a Free State - not yet in existence.  Prolonged and--detailed  negotiations would be required to procure the red-rafting of the  Treaty necessary to give effect to the change suggested.-   Even If agreement  were reached-, the delays  would be formidable, and in  the- result  the opponents of the Treaty,  in  Ireland would allege  that the  iristru- ment had been vitiated...        (2)  Assuming&apos;all these difficulties were surmounted&apos;,, we think it would be courting  disaster  to set up  the Boundary Commission a month from  now, when passions are at their height&apos; on the boundary, and-when the  Southern  Government are  moving forward to an election which absorbs, their thoughts and  which  would                                                   inevitably/
inevitably degenerate into a boundary battle on the most partisanlines.   we think there is a far better chance of a  settlement by agreement of the boundary question on the lines of the CraigCollins agreement of Jan. 1922 when the Free State Governmenthas been duly installed, and is supported by a majority of theSouthern Irish Fleetorate.        (3)  Although Irish t/ministers might consent to the ulster month running from the present Act, they would only doso on the basis that the present Act constituted final ratifica-tion.  We are not prepared to concede this point.  We have notyet seen the Constitution, nor ascertained whether it conformsto the Treaty and to the assurances given to the SouthernUnionists at the same time.  We do not know what the  result of theFree State Flection will be..   we are not prepared to abrogateour final -controls, such as.we judge them, in these matters atthis stage-.        Let me thank you for the courtesy of your letter, andalso express my respect for the manner in which you and theHouse, of Lords generally have dealt with this extremely diff ic itand painful subject., and believe me                             Yours very sincerely,                             (Sd.) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
