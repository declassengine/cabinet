THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot; rS-GOVERNMENT)S.E military E JU.                              0 A BIH ICP. 3840,BILL TO MAKE PURTIIER PROVISION V/ITH RESPECTTO JTHE TENURE 01&apos; OFFICE OP THE CHAIRMAN  of the FISHERY BOARD ii&apos;0R SCOTLAND.Memorandum &quot;by tho Secretary  for  Scotland.     The object of this Bill  (of which  a draft is  annexed)is to make the office of Chairman  of  the  Fishery Board forScotland an ordinary Civil Service post instead of one towhich the holder is appointed for  five 1 years  at a  time.Mr. Angus Sutherland, C.B,, who held  the  office for aconsiderable period under successive  quinquennialappointments, retired in 1920.   I selected  to succeed himMr. D.T. Jones.. C.B.E., who had filled  the  office  of secretary to tho Board with great  ability.    Mr. Jones isa Civil Servant with more than 30  years  pensionableservice .   He obviously could not  afford  to  give up bispensionable post for a non-pensionable  one.    It was, there-fore j arranged that he should be appointed  Chairman while continuing to hold the office, of Secretary.    His  wholesrlary   1,000 per annum) is paid to him as  Secretary thuspreserving his pension rights..  ;.     While this expedient meets the immediate difficultyI consider that .it wi 11 be much more  satisfactory  to place the Chairmanship on a regular footing as  a  pensionableCivil Service post.   I therefore  ask sanction for theintroduction of the annexed Bill.                          fSIGNED)   ROBERT MUNRO.Scottish  Office,     Whitehall.14th March, 1922./
