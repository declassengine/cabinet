Bey whichhad .unfortunately failed^   The conflict had recommencedand its cessation was more than ever desirable in ov&apos;&apos;er-7r*body18 Interests -  It was for this reason that ho himself &apos;had proposed the forthcoming meeting in Parisa   It had seemed to him3 howover, useful to seo His Excellencybeforehand, as he had already soon Iczot Pasha,-.   He had asked Izzet Pasha for Ms views and it was even moreimportant to imow tho views of His ExcGlleney0     Youssuf Esmal Boy replied that the Turks wore not making war for war :s sak**s  they  desireds. just and durablepeace::  their claims were known,  they were only what the  Prime Minister had said on January 5th 1918$ :and theywere the principles for which the great war had been fought.His Government desired a Turkey populated  in the majorityby Turks,- and independent,   They only desired to livelike other nations0   They considered that  there was noincompatibility between the vital Interests cf Turkey andthose of the.British Empireu -  On the contrary there was-agreat conformity between them   The solution of theEastern question and the ensuing peace would serve theeconomic restoration of Europe, &apos;  The National Assembly  had instructed him to  come to London to explain this and to
find out the Intentions of His Majesty0s Government inregard to peace,,     Lord Cur zon e n qi ir e d wb ether, b e f or e s pe aking,Youssuf Kemal Bey desired to say anything of theviews of the National Assembly on the matters     Youssuf Kemal Bey repeated that the national assembly desired peace and Turkish sovereigntywithin Its national limits9     Lord;jCurzbn replied that His Excellency had stated the desires of the National Assembly ingeneral terms.   He had said that they desiredpeace- with the  aid of Great Britain and had dwelton the conformity of interests and points ofview of the two countries;,   There was, however.a point&quot;which disturbed Lord curzon.when he heardYoussuf Kemal Bey speak of this conformity - inWhich Lord Curs on himself believed..   That point was the  close alliance between Angora and theSoviet -government   Lord Cuf^cn knew the termsof the Treaty between Angora and Moscow and of the close relations, and supplies In money and armsthat had been, and were being, received by Angorafrom the Soviet Authorities *   Knowing thefundamental difference between.the tenets of bolshevism and the views of the majority ofTurks, Lord Curzon was surprised that the angora government should be seeking and receiving                                          assistance/
assistance from those who were not animated byfriendly sentiments and whose principles of Governmentwere as distasteful to Great Britain as to Turkey.How did His Excellency reconcile this conformity of .interests with the fasts to which Lord Ourzon had re-f erred?...........                    ,     Youssuf. Kemal, Bey replied that the has so-TurkishAgreement should, not be interpreted as hostile tothe British Government.  It was not a.. Treaty of alliancebut .of, friendship.,.. The Soviet Government had recognised the legitimate, aspirations of the Turkish Government,,but there was no aggressive article directed againstanyone.-; It was , a . po.lit.lcal Treaty but Turkisheconomic, and social principles... had: riot -been sacrificed,,Those doctrines were in. conformity with the needs ofthe. Turks and were, not Bolshevist. &apos;  There was nolimitation on their power to make treaties with anyother, Pow.er0  This proved that the Treaty, was in no way directed against.Great Britaino  - .  Lord Cur z on. said th a. t. he. had. 1 i s t en e d w i th interessees tto His Excellency&apos;s explanations.  He had no desire to    :&apos;:     the       ^               &apos;    &quot;   &apos; &apos;y.enter into/terms of the Treaty or. to deprecate that theGovernment of Angora should receive recognition ofits social and economic interests.  But there was more than, that.  He would speak frankly,  There was much sympathy in this country with Turkey and a desire to come to a satisfactory, arrangement, butthere, was also a strong feeling against the SovietGovernment,.its methods of propaganda, and itsinstitutions,.  His Excellency had spoken only ofthe conditions of the Russo-Turkish Treaty not of the                                           other
other.and very important  point  regarding the largeresources and military  supplies -which- Angora continuedto receive from-Moscow.&apos;--  &quot;lany people in this countrylooked..with; apprehension, on  a situation,.by, which . Angoramight conceivably use this  assistance to tarn its  powerdirectly&apos; against His Majesty--a  government,  with whom it now. prof ess ad its desire, to establish good . relations s&apos;:.&apos;e had information -regardingthe  massing of troops ....on the Southern frontier&apos;  cf  Turkey towards ..

It would he unfortunate were there- a.,susoicj onthat Angora might use these  recources against; terri tcr-yin our occupation or under our  Mandate..?,  fie would  beglad to loarn from His  Excellency. that Anger a had. no.such intentions  The Bri-tish.

He  did not  know what was happeningtowards&apos; Irak,,: but any movements-, now let, only  he movements of;&apos; defence:.When that  defence  was assured  the movementswould end,              - &apos; -   .-...          ,.          .      Lord Ourzon-replied- that  His ,Excellency had stated that ilae Government - ofAngora.:, only used, these resources for defence.,.  no t for  purposes of. attack e          -----    ;-         ... ...,.:  - .. :.&apos;      , - .  NOW
How the only forces that, could attack Turkey were theGreek forces a   Lord Curzon hoped that we might arriveat means to obviate thls0  The arms were therefore notwantod -against the Greeks-  It was out. Of the question that wc should ourselves contemplate any invasion of orattack on those with whom we desire peacec  Under thesecircumstances Lord Curzon regarded what His Excellencyhad said as a direct pledge against tho use of these forces against His&apos; Majesty5s Government.,  This hounderstood to be the meaning of the statement just received from His Excellency^     Youssuf Kemal Bey&apos;replied that as soon as peacewas concluded between Angora and His majesty&apos;s government, the&apos; above-mentioned possibility would nolonger -exist e     \L0rdCurzon replied that, that was not tho samethingi  What His Excellency was now saying was that unless peace was concluded on a basis satisfactory toAngora these fdrees.. might be turned against GreatBritain&apos;,&apos;  /Those&quot; were not conditions on which one could&apos; enter into negotiationss  A much more explicitdeclaration was necessary.  Lord Our2on desired toenter the Paris Conversations with every chance ofsuccesss  If people in this country believed it possiblethat these forces.-might, be used as an instrument ofmenace his hands would be tied and ho would not be ableto uso his influence in the same manner as if he knew that tho friendly Intentions of the Turkish Governmentcorresponded with friendly aots&apos;g     Youssuf kemal Bey replied that there had. never                                                   be on
been any intention of making any throat but he thought that any undertaking must be reciprocal and if before the Conference began Turkey obtained the assurance that her legitimate desires would be satisfied, she would better be able to give the undertaking that Lord Curzon desired.  If  Lord Curzon could tell him that the peace desired by the Angora Government would be assured they could tell him that the eventualities referred to would not be possible.  He added that the Turkish programme was well-known.

Lord Curzon replied that he would rely on His Excellency&apos;s repeated assurances that these forces were only wanted for purposes of defence.  If Angora infringed that undertaking and renewed hostilities with us we should resist with all the means in our power. That would be fatal to peace.  He did not wish to prolong this part of the discussion as there were other subjects to be touched upon.  Lord Curzon would,  however, consider what His Excellency had said as being capable of no other interpretation.

Youssuf Kemal B?y had asked him to state frankly the fundamental principles to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach importance.

He would begin with ?. The first of these was the safeguards that it will be necessary to secure for the protection of Christian and other minorities. His Excellency know well the strong feeling that existed in all civilised countries on this matter, and how heavy was
was the burden of blame believed to rest on the Turkish Government for the deportations and massacres in the past. The ?owers could agree to no solution that rendered possible their repetition. It would, therefore, be necessary to introduce the most stringent precautions for the security of the minorities remaining in the hands of the Turkish Government in Asia ?.  At the same time, we were ready to admit that these guarantees should be reciprocal and should extend to the Turkish minorities in Greece or elsewhere.

The second fundamental principle was the neutralisation of the Straite.  The Powers would not consent again to put themselves in the position of allowing the Turks to shut the Dardanelles. Lord Curzon was certain that if the Turkish Government thought it could be left in possession of the entrance to the Straits and both shores of the Marmora, it would be greatly mistaken.

There were two other important principles, obligations of honour which no country could honestly escape :-

(1) The recognition of pre-war debts, and

(2) The recognition of claims arising out of the war.

There were two other considerations on which he would say only a word in passing. On one of these points it would probably be possible in some way to meet the Turkish Government. On the other point if would not be possible.
possibleo  Tho first was tbe question of eobhornio andfinan3ial capitulations,  Lord Ourzon hoped that in thenew arrangements we might be able to secure a considerable measure of financial and economic independence for Turkey$At any rate he would do his besto     On the second point, however;. His Excellency would find that the Powers would take a stern line i0e* in regardto tho claim that the Turkish Army should c ontiiiwe infuture to be raised by conscriptions-  It was impossibleto make in favour of Turkey an exception net accorded tothe other ox-enemy Powers0     In regard to Smyrna Lord Ourzon well understood the desire of the Turkish Government to recover controlover their former possessions in Asia Minor j and to seetho Greeks departo  His Excellency must remember, however.that the Greeks had been invited to Smvriia by the powers at Paris in 1919, that they had rendered considerableservices to the Allies,, and that- there was a largo Greekpopulation in those reglohSo  The Powers must have due regard for Greeces who hold at present a large, area in asia Minoro  An Army of that size could not easily be disposed ofc  Lord Gurzon had some time ago persuadedthe Greeks to put. themselves in the hands of the Allieso..He would be prepared to use his influence to bring abouta peaceful and voluntary retirement cf tho Greeks fromAsia Minor, on two conditions :- First, that this should&apos;form part of the general settlement; and, second3-y3 thatwe wore satisfied as to the regime to be- set up if theGroeks departed,,  This brought Lord Curzon to theparticular point that he wished to put before His Excellency0                                                        if                            IfcT Q
                                                 -    297   I     If fresh proposals of peace were  to be  usefullydiscussedv  and if he was to use his influence with theGreek  Government to induce them to carry out his advice in regard to evacuation, it was essential that hostilitiesshould not  meanwhile bo resumed0  If this should happen,.all our labours would have been thrown away0  It was a fundamental condition that neither party should fightagain, and  he did not believe that either party wished tofight again.  Lord Curzon must state emphatically thatif tho proceedings at Paris were to be fruitful and resultin the restoration of Anatolia and the peaoeful retirement of the Greeks, it was indispensable that both parties should agree to an armistice and remain in their positionso     In conclusion, Lord Curzon observed that an armistice of course concerned Angora more than Constantinople.,,If the former desired to see him enter into  the forth-coming discussions with a prospect of arriving at adefinite and peaceful result, the first step was that theTurkish Government should declare its willingness for anarmistices   If this essential condition were fulfilledwe - could then examine the other points in question andcover all the ground.  If tho discussion was liable tobe interrupted by a resumption of hostilities, this Wouldbe fatal and the chance of peace would be gone,  The only way was to  arrange for&apos; a cessation of hostilities!     The Prench and Italian Governments would certainlygive the same advice.     Lord Gurzon realised that of course His Excellencycould only speak for the Turks0  It would be necessaryalso to get the Greeks to agree0   Lord Curzon hoped forsuccess in this direction, hut not unless there were a                                        corresponding
corresponding obligation from the Turk30     Youssuf. Komal Bey said that he could give no immediate answer to all this, but would be honoured toreturn latercWhitehall Gardens.. S.W*1.S   18th March,. 1922,,-ID-
