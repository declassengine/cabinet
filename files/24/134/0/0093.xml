NO. 130,SECRET.EMBASSY 6P THEUNITED STATES OF AMERICA.London,  March 32nd   1922.My Lord:I have the  honour to transmit herewitha memorandum which my Government instructs meto hand to Your Lordship.I have the  honour to he, my Lord, withthe highest  consideration,Your most obedient,  humble  servant,For the Ambassador:(Signed)    Post WheelerCounsellor ol Embassy.The Most Honourable,    The Marquess Curzon of Kedleston,  K.G,,             etc   etc.,   etc
MQRANDUM.     The Government of the United States lias believedand still believes that the Governments of the AlliedPowers have no disposition to question the right ofthe United States to Oe paid upon an equal footing withthem the actual cost of its army of occupation whichit has maintained in Germany since the joint ArmisticeAgreement of November 11th, 1918.   While the attitudeof the Government of the United States in expectingfull payment of these costs has been repeatedly setforth, it is deemed to be appropriate,, in view ofrecent developments,.to make this statement of its position,     The amount of the claim of the United States forits Army costs is understood to be well known and tobe free from any substantial dispute.   According tothe information and accounts in the possession of theAllied Governments it appears that the total cost- ofall the Armies of Occupation from November 11th. 1018to May 1st, 1921, amounted to 3,639,282,000 gold marks;that the amounts due to Belgium, Prance and Italy *for their Army costs for that period have been paidin full (chiefly through deliveries of property); anathat the unpaid balance of Army costs due May 1st,1921, amounted to 1,660,090,000 gold marks due tothe United States and the British Empire as follows:       United States  966,374,000 gold marks;       British Empire 693,716,000 gold marks.     It is understood that between May 1st, 1921. and december 31st, 1921, the- British Government received                                           cash
2/lTo.  76.cash payments as against this balance of about^^-,696,000 gold marks.   In view of the position takenby the Government of the United States this payment wasexpressly made and received subject to the rights ofthe United States.     In November 1921 the Commission appointed by theSupreme Council to give its opinion on the expenses ofthe Armies of Occupation made its report dealing withthe Army costs since May 1st, 1921.   This includedcalculations with respect to the American Army, andits actual costs since that date were included in theproposed provision for payment pari passu with theother Powers..     It had been supposed that this report to theSupreme Council would be^g^,the Conference of Am-bassadors and would pave the way for. suitable action with respect to the American Army costs both current and accumulated.   It was with surprise that theGovernment of the United States recently learned that negotiations, in connection with and following themeeting at Cannes in January last apparently contem-plated the substitution for the recommendation of theArmy Costs Commission of other arrangements whichwould ignore American Army costs altogether althoughestimates both for Army costs and reparations werebeing made on the  basis of the entire capacity ofthe German Government to pay.   When it came to thenotice of this Government that it was proposed atthe meeting of the Finance Ministers to convene at                                         Paris
3/N0. 76.Paris on March 8th definitely to assign the greaterportion of.the amount heretofore paid in cash byGermany and not yet finally allocated to the paymentof Army costs without making any provision for thoseof the American Army it was deemed advisable again to direct attention to the position of the UnitedStates.   The Government of the United States hasbeen advised that all the arrangements of the finance ministers have been made subject to the rights cf theUnited States and that these Ministers have also suggested that the Government of the United states should take up the question directly with the Govern-ments concerned,,     The Armistice Agreement concluded between theAllied and Associated Governments and Germany onNovember 11th, 1918, provided for military occupation by the Allied and United States forces jointly andit was expressly provided that &quot;the upkeep of thetroops of occupation in the Rhine districts (exclud-ing Alsace Lorraine) shall be charged to tho GermanGovernment.&quot;     It is not believed that the meaning of thisAgreement can be regarded as doubtful.   It had notonly its express provision but its necessary irnplioa-tions.   It is the view of this Government, and itis confidently believed that it is the view of allthe Governments concerned, that this Agreement onthe part of the Allied and Associated governments with Germany, and with each other, had the clear                                        import
/                  4/N0. 76.import that the Powers associated in this joint-enterprise should stand upon an equal footing asto the payment of all the actual costs of theirArmies of Occupation and that none of the powers could consistently with the Agreement make any arrangement for. a preferential or exclusiveright of payment.   Further it is assumed thatit would not for a moment be contended that anyof the Allied Powers would have been entitled toenter into any agreement by which all the assetsor revenues of the German Empire and its con-stituent States would be taken for their benefitto the exclusion of any of the other Powers con-cerned.     It was apparently in recognition of tho ex-isting and continuing obligation as to Army coststhat, in the Treaty of Versailles, in undertaking to place &quot;a first charge upon the assets andrevenues of the German Empire and its constituentStates,&quot; (Article 243), priority was given tothe total cost of all Armies of the Allied andAssociated Governments in occupied German tcrri--tory from the date of the signature of theArmistice.     Articles 250 and 251 of the Treaty.ofVersailles provide;  Article 249  &quot;There shallbe paid by the German Government the total cost                                      of
                  5/1 &quot;o.  760 of  all Armies  of  the Allied and Associated Govern- rnents in  occupied German territory from the date of  the signature  of the Armistice of November 11th, 1918, including upkeep  of men  and beasts, lodging and billeting  pay and allowances, salaries and.wages, bedding, heating, lighting, clothing, equipment, harness and  saddlery, armament and rolling stock, air services, treatment of sick and wounded, veterinary and remount services, transport service of all sorts (such as by rail, sea or river,  motor lorries) communications and correspondence and in general  the cost of all administrative or technical services, the working of  which  is necessary for the  training of troops and for keeping their numbers  up to strength and preserving their  military efficiency............&quot;     Article 251.    &quot;The priority of the charges established by Article  243 shall, subject to the qualifications made below, be as follows:-      &quot;(a)   the cost of the Armies of Occupation            as defined  under Article 249 during            the Armistice and  its extensions,      &quot;(b)   the cost of any Armies of Occupation            as defined  under Article 249 after            the coming  into force of the present            Treaty................................&quot;                                         By
               6/N0, 76.By the Treaty between the United States and Geraiurry,signed August 25th, 1921, the ratification of  whichwere exchanged on November 11th, 1921,  it is pro-vided that the United States shall enjoy the rightsand advantages stipulated for the benefit of theUnited States in the Treaty of Versailles, notwith-standing the fact that the Treaty has not been rati-fied by the United States.  The Government of  theUnited States accordingly entertains the view, and-submits it to the consideration of tube Allied  Gov-ernments, that the United States is entitled to pay-ment. of the costs of her Army of Occupation paripassu with the Allied Governments and that paymentsreceived by them from Germany in the circumstancesdisclosed cannot be used to the exclusion of theUnited States without its consent.     The Government of the United States is unwill-lng to conclude that the justice of its claim  is not fully recognized,  The Governments of the AlliedPowers will not be unmindful of the fact that  theGovernment of the United States has repeatedly andearnestly been Solicited not to withdraw its army of Occupation and this army has been continued uponthe basis of the right to be paid its actual costupon an  equal footing with the Allies.  But, whileit is believed that the Allied Governments  cannotfail to  appreciate the manifest equity of the claim of the United States, it  is understood that it hasbeen suggested that there are technical difficultieswhich stand in the way of its recognition. While                                       willing.....
7/No.  76.willing to take into full consideration every pos-sible question, this Government is unable to find any such technical obstacle.     It is assumed that if any technical question were raised, it would be based upon the fact thatthe United States has not ratified the Treaty ofVersailles,  It may be pointed out, however, thatGermany has explicitly consented to the priority of payment of the cost of the American Army of Occupa-tion notwithstanding the fact that the Treaty ofVersailles has not been ratified by the UnitedStates.  Hence any technical objection to the applica-tion of the payments made by Germany to the dischargeof the just claim of the United States for the costof its Army of Occupation upon the ground that theUnited States had not ratified the Treaty of Ver-sailles would obviously rest not upon any action orlack of action on the part of Germany but solelyupon the refusal of the Governments of the AlliedPowers themselves to permit the discharge of anadmittedly equitable claim and thus to seek tomaintain in their behalf exclusively a first charge upon all the assets and revenues of the German Em-pire and its constituent States for demands exhaustingthe full capacity of the German Government to pay.The Government of the United States finds it impos-sible to conceive that any such attitude would be entertained by the Allied Governments,  The Govern-ment of the United States believes that its rightto priority of payment for its actual Army costs                                        upon.......
8/N0. 76.upon an equal footing with tho Allied Powers is  notin any way affected hy its failure to ratify theTreaty of Versailles,,  The right of the UnitedStates to share in this priority was not expresslyconditioned, and, in view of ths nature of the claim and of the fact that the treaty purported to create a first charge upon all the assets and revenues  ofthe German Empire should not be construed as beingconditioned upon the ratification of the treaty  bythe United States.  It may be noted that the treaty was to come into force on the ratification-en thepart of Germany and of three of the principal allied and Associated Powers,  By Article 251 quoted abovethere is provision for priority of the &quot;cost of  the armies of Occupation&quot; during the Armistice and itsextensions and the cost of &quot;any armies&quot; of occupa-tion after the coming into force of the treaty.  Thiswould seem clearly to embrace the cost of the army of occupation maintained by the United States.     The Government of the United States believes that its right to be paid the actual cost of itsArmy of Occupation pari paseu with the cost of the armies of the Allied Powers is not only a clergy-equitable right but is free from any technical ob:-jection.     This Government will welcome any suggestionfrom the Allied Governments for the reasonableadjustment of this matter.  Upon receiving assurance of payment, this Government will be only too happy
              9/No.  76,to proceed to the consideration of suitable means by which its just claim  may be satisfied.  Pendingsuch consideration and adjustment, this  Governmentearnestly hopes that the Allied Governments willbe disposed to refrain from giving effect  to  any arrangements for the distribution of  cash  paymentsreceived from Germany to the exclusion of  the claim of the United States.London, March 22nd,  1922.
