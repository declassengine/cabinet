MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR WAR.    In a  recent telegram, circulated  by the Foreign  Office, from Mr. Satow,  Beirut,   0178(No. 12 (E),  dated 3rd March), attention is called to the alleged intention  of the    116Ivemalists to attack Iraq during the  present month.  The  forces available for  thispurpose,  and their  disposition,  are  indicated in  the following  note prepared  by theGeneral Staff, which brings up to date the appreciation  circulated in November last(CP. 3494).                                                                      L. W.-E.  THE WAR OFFICE,         15th March, i922.    1. &quot;The  situation in  Iraq  was reviewed by  the  General Staff in November, 1921(OP.  3494).   Generally  speaking,  the political situation  has not altered since thatappreciation  was written, except  for  the fact that pressure  from  His . Majesty sGovernment has caused some doubt as to whether  the Franco-Kemalist Agreement  ofOctober, 1921, will be carried out in its entirety.    KemaTs strategy, in the  past, has been  to  apply  pressure against  each  of  hisenemies in turn, and the  results have been such as  to encourage a further trial of these methods.  Firstly, he brought pressure to bear against the  Italians in the Adalia area,resulting  in the Italian  evacuation of this area; secondly, military operations againstthe French in Cilicia resulted in the evacuation  of  Cilicia by the French ;  and, thirdly,military pressure against  the Greeks, resulting in the Greek defeat on the Sakaria Riverin September, 1921, has made  the retention by the  Greeks of the Smyrna Enclave aquestion of doubt.   It  is therefore possible  that,  inspired  by these -successes,  theKenialists may  hope to  obtain a  similar  result from military operations against  theBritish in the Mosul area of Iraq.    There have been indications  lately that the Turks are turning  their  attention tothe Iraq  front.   They have  undoubtedly sent emissaries amongst  the tribes, andadvanced detachments, principally consisting of officers, into the Rowanduz area.   - 3. Since CP. 3494  was circulated, there has  been a gravitation  eastwards  of  thecentre of force of the Turkish Army on the Cilician Syrian Iraq front.  It is thoughtthat -  &apos;.    (i.)  The gendarmerie and the division (a  newly  formed one) in the Adana area           would be sufficient to maintain order in the area Eregli -Urfa.    (ii.)  The division (a  newly formed  one) in the Aintab area, plus the gendarmerie in           the  Diarbekr area,&apos; would be  sufficient  to maintain order in the Urfa            Bitlis area.    (hi.)  The weak division in  the Bitlis-Rowanduz area would be required to maintain           order in that area.    (iv.)  The situation in the  Caucasus does not  allow of. the immediate  move of  the           division (a regular one and a good one) in the Bayazid area, southwards.                There remain, therefore, the regular division (2nd),  the newly formed            cavalry  brigade and the  army troops in  the  Urfa Bitlis area  available           for  an immediate attach  on  Mosul.   The bulk  of this  force is  at  the           present moment in the area Mardin Nisibin Diarbekr.  This force totals,           approximately, 3,000 rifles. 750 sabres, with 20 guns, and is well  equipped            with transport and technical services.

     4. It will  therefore be seen  that, should the  Turks decide to attack Iraq  thismonth, they have, on the spot, one division plus a cavalry brigade, totalling 3,000 rifles and 750 sabres with 20 guns, available for this purpose.     As stated in paragraph 4 (a) of CP. 3494, if the Turks  were willing to abandonfor a time all idea of offensive operations against the Greeks, and were content withmerely containing them, they could safely reduce their Western army by 5 divisions.The  probability of the Greeks assuming an immediate offensive is as small to-day aswhen CP.  3494 was written.  Should the Turks decide to withdraw  these  5 divisions from the Western front, they could reach the Iraq front within six weeks, and  thiswould bring the total Turkish forces threatening  Iraq  up to a strength of 15,500 rifles and  750 sabres, with 80 guns.     It is doubtful, however, whether, in view of the  present  situation of the  Turksvis-d-vis the Greeks, the Turks would at this moment commence another war on theirsouthern frontier ; but that they are threatening to  do  so, probably with a view toinfluencing British. policy at  the  forthcoming conference of Foreign  Ministers on theTurco-Greek question, appears to be a fact.   That they can back up their threat  to theextent of the force indicated, if they wish to do so, is certain.
