A                                                             o                      SHIPBUI.LD INS  D IS.?UTa.              Memorandum by the II inib tor o  Lah our,ST.          The negotiations between the shipbuilding employers and5810.   the trade unions which have been in progress recently are        concerned solely with a proposed reduction of wages.             On the 19th January the shipbuilding employers made a        proposal for a reduction of 26/6d - the cost-of-living advances.        Only 28$ of the berths in the yards are occupied and only in a        very few cases are there new orders to proceed with as the        occupied berths fall vacant.  Between 35$ and 36$ of the        employees in the trade are unemployed..  The shipbuilding        employers have stated that even with the amount of tonnage        which is laid up and the low prices of second-hand tonnage        they believe that they could obtain orders for new ships if        the cost of production could be reduced to a certain figure.        One prominent shipowner, in addition, is prepared to lay down        several ships as a speculation if the operative costs could be        sufficiently reduced.             After long discussions the employers1 final proposal was        that 16/6d should be withdrawn as from the 15th March,  that a        conference should be held to decide at what date the further        10/- was to come off,.-and that at this seoond conference        arrangements should be made to meet the claims for  special        consideration of the lower-paid general labourers.  This  offer        was put to the ballot and rejected by 113,000 to 11,000.             When the unions reported this decision to the  employers        the employers stated that the situation of the trade  left them        no alternative but to make the first cut  as from the  15th March        of 16/6d.  &apos;fhe Unions reported the matter to  the General  Council                                                                 /of
of the Trades Union Congress and to me under the industrial courts Act with a request that 1 should exercise the powers conferred in Part II and appoint a Court ox Inquiry.,  Shearguments put forward in favour of this were that the lactsof the industry, tho reasons for undercutting hy foreignoountrios and. the proportionate share of the cost of regainingmarkets to he borne by the employers had not been made clear to them and consequently the leaders wore, not in a position tosatisfy their members that such groat reductions were justifi-able.     The employers had apparently refused to agree to a jointapplication for a Court of Inquiry, and a Court, if it had tobe appointed, would havo to be imposed upon them.  before deciding what reply to make to the request of the Unions Iinterviewed the employers and found that the meetings with theunions had not been satisfactory because the unions had broughta large number of delegates and did not feel themselves able to advance from the position of the ballot which was that no reduction at all was justified.  In these circumstancesnegotiations in the true sense of the word had not existed.It was clear that the employers wore prepared to discuss thematter from a business standpoint provided that  they could secure some recognition by the unions of the necessity for avery substantial reduction in wages.  I accordingly saw someof the leaders of the men, and suggested to thorn that a fewrepresentatives should have an informal conference with theemployers on Monday afternoon to ses whother it was notpossiblo for negotiations to be re-opened.  They agreed to summon the Emergency Committee in order that a small doputationmight bo empowered to moot tho employers informally.      Tho informal discussion with the employers took plaoo                                                 /last
last night, and I understand that satisfactory progress wasmade.  The Unions propose to appoint a Negotiating committee with powers to negotiate a settlement.   Tha proposal is now&quot;being considered by the Unions.                                (Sgd)  T.J. MAO SAMARA,try of Labour,oh 7th, 1982,i.&quot;
