The tube runs from the  General Post Office East to  apoint near the North Western District Office, and wasconstructed by the Pneumatic Despatch Company Limited under special Acts,   It had been disused for many years and had,indeed, been out into at several points by various bodies.In the latter part of 1920, however, a letter was receivedfrom the Pneumatic Despatch Company asking whether the tubewould be of any use to the Post Offioe,   The PostmasterGeneral was advised that although the Company&apos;s title to  thetube had not lapsed, the Company had no power to sell thetube, and that It was doubtful whether the Postmaster Generalcould buy the tube and exercise his powers under the TelegraphAots with reference thereto without statutory sanction^Having regard to the large capital expenditure which will be incurred on cables to be laid in the tube, it is essentialthat the Postmaster General&apos;o title and his powers inrelation to the tube should be made clear by means of an act of Parliament,                                             Negotiations
    Negotiations for the purchase of the tube resulted inthe acceptance by the Company of an offer of  7,600, and anAgreement to this effect was entered into on the 50th Deoember1921.
