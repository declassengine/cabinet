(Circulated in connection with.  Item 1*  on  the         Cabinet Agenda for Monday the  20th instant.)     LORD GURZON began by saying that tho  objoot for. which  hehad desired to see His Highness was  to  bring-  to an end,  ifpossible, the present disastrous war.   He&apos;.wished  Izaet  Pashato realise that His Majesty1 s Government had  no.feelings of .&apos;.hostility &apos; towar ds the Turkish -Government,  or  people, or  Islam.Oh the contrary, the Empire had a very  large  Moslem population,for whioh he himself bad always had  a. -particularly warmsympathy and respect.     Unfortunately, this Empire cannot  forget that Turkey wasdragged by bad adviae  into war against it, and this Turkishparticipation had prolonged the war  for two if  not three years,and&apos; oaused the loss of msny millions of pounds  and hundreds of thousands of lives,    v;e had been victorious,  but we  were  not anxious to be harsh in the hour ox victory.   His  Highnessmust, however, realise that it was cut  of  the question for  ,thevanquished to dlotate terms like victors.   The Allies were entitled to take steps to prevent a  recurrence  of  such events and &quot;Turkey must pay the prioe of  the error  of 1914.  ?.&apos;e  were,however, anxious to forget the past  and to re-establish theTurkish Government and nation in a position-of  independence andstrength, in whioh they could, on friendly terms withGreat Britain, renew  their national  existence,  and play a
a considerable part in Eastern politics.  With this object we had joined with the Allies in drawing up the Treaty of Sevres. Since then,  however, the situation had changed and the Treaty should no longer be  put  into operation in its original ?.

His Highness had been asked at his first interview to prepare an aide memoire giving the views of his Government in regard to the form that should be taken by the revision of this Treaty. Lord ? had read this paper with the greatest disappointment. It did not, in his view, contain bases on which the Powers could  arrive at agreement. It contained, on the contrary, the most extreme and unacceptable forms of Turkish  demands taken as a whole. Some conditions we should be able to accept, others could be discussed, but come it would be impossible to agree to. Lord Curzon did not desire at this  moment to go ? through the views put forward in the memorandum.  He preferred to indicate certain fundamental principles on which he was sure that the Allied Powers would insist in arriving at a new agreement.

To begin with Anatolia. The first of these  was the safeguards that it will be necessary to secure for  the protection of Christian and other minorities. His Highness knew well the strong feeling that existed in all  civilised countries on this matter, and how heavy was the burden of blame believed to rest on the Turkish Government for the deportations and massacres in the past. The Powers could agree to no solution that rendered possible their repetition. It would, therefore, be necessary to introduce the most stringent/
stringent precautions for the security of the minorities remaining in the hands of the Turkish Government in Asia Minor. At the same time, we were ready to admit that these guarantees should be reciprocal and should extend to the Turkish minorities in Greece or elsewhere.

The second fundamental principle was the neutralisation of the Straits. The Powers would not consent again to put themselves in the position of allowing the Turks to shut the Dardanelles. Lord Curzon was Certain that if the Turkish Government thought it could be left in possession of the entrance to the Straits and both shores of the Marmora, it would be greatly mistaken.

There were two other important principles, obligations of honour which no country could honestly escape:-

(1) The recognition of pre-war debts, and

(2) The recognition of claims arising out of the war.

There were two other considerations in His Highness&apos;s memorandum on which he would say only a word in passing. On one of these points it would probably be possible in some way to meet the Turkish Government. On the other point it would not be possible. The first was the question of economic and financial capitulations. Lord Curzon hoped that in the new arrangements we might be able to secure a considerable measure of financial and economic independence for Turkey. At any rate he would do his best.

On the second point, however, His Highness would find that the Powers would take a stern line, i.e., in regard to the claim that the Turkish army should continue in future to be raised by conscription. It was impossible to/
to make in favour of Turkey an exception not accorded to the other &apos;ex-? Powers.

In regard to Sm? Lord Curzon well understood the desire of the Turkish Government to recover control over their former possessions in Asia Minor, and to see the Greeks depart. His Highness must remember, however, that the Greeks had been invited to Smyres by the Powers at Paris in 1919, that they had rendered considerable services to the Allies, and that there was a large Greek population in those regions. The Powers must have due regard for Greece, who held at present a large area in Asia Minor. An army of that size could not easily be disposed of. Lord Curzon had some time age persuaded the Greeks to put themselves in the hands of the Allies. He would be prepared to use his influence to bring about a peaceful and voluntary retirement of the Greeks from Asia Minor, on two conditions:- First, that this should form part of the general settlement; and, secondly, that we were satisfied as to the r√©gime to be set up if the Greeks departed. This brought Lord Curzon to the particular point that he wished to put before His Highness.

If fresh proposals of peace were to be usefully discussed, and if he was to use his influence with the Greek Government to induce them to carry cut his advice in regard to evacuation, it was essential that hostilities should not meanwhile be resumed. If this should happen, all our labours would have been thrown away. It was a fundamental condition that neither party should fight again. No doubt this matter concerned the Representative of Angora more than Highness, and the /point
point would bo ropoated  to Yeauuf Kema.3  that afternoon.Lord Our a on nust, however, repeat emphatically that ifthe proceedings  at Paris were  to  he fruitful and reou.ltin the restoration of  Anatolia and the  peaceful retirement of tho Greeks, it waa  indispensable that &quot;both parties should agree to  an armistice arid  remain in their positions        Lcrd Curs eh was  quite  willing,  if both His Kigbr. heand Yu3suf Kemal so desired, tc see them both tho next day,   That was  fcr the  Turkish Representatives to decade,Put, in any. case, the  foregoing suggestion wqu&quot;! d becorarainicated to  the French and Italian  Government, s. vr?iowould certainly&quot;  share  Lord Ourzon&apos;s view that the be3tguarantee of&quot; success would be  the cessation of hostilitiesduring the discuooion  and until it has.been ascertainedwhether peace  is attainable  or not.        IZZFJT  PASHA fchanked Lord  Curzbn for the expression of his friendly  feelings towards  Islam.   He agreed-that turkey&apos;.had committed a;&quot;grave political  error, in entering the war.  - She had &quot;been  driven by fear  of Russia;  itwas not a moral  fault, and the price of it &apos;had alreadybeen paid by the lose  of two-thirds, of the Turkish Empire *How Turkey desired to  link up.  again with England, whomShe could perhaps help- mofe  than  she. had hurt,   Turkey,after all.,: had riot hurt  Great  Britain so rrUoh as she hadhurt Russia&apos;.&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;  &quot; It had  never  entered his he ad. to dictate.conditions..    He had only wished  to put forward theTurkish desires  and. claims.    These were not unchangeable&apos; i&apos;   &quot;&quot;  &apos;&apos;......    .............things, bit,,  if  the modifications in his&apos; pro.gramr.ae/.wenttoo far, the  Constantinople  Government  could dp. nothing.        In regard to minorities,  Turkey had no - do.3ire&apos; tohurt them. &apos;  Protective-&apos; -measures  could  no doubt. be taken.
 but not of a character injurious to Turkish independence or calcui&amp;tod to eocoite undue aspirations and revolutionary tendenoi-..e among the minorities.   These measures might he -temporary, hut&apos; not eternal.         As to conscription, Turkey was not rich enough for voluntary service.   There mast he conscription for a few years at least. ,        (2n the rest of the points he hoped that it would he possible to arrive at good/result s.   Turkey was ready to neutralise the Straits, tut could never live in safety at.Constantinopls of the Greeks were on the Marmora..         In.regard to the armistice. His Highness was in agreement;&quot;  but Constantinople had not the force to order Angora.         LORD curzon concluded the interview by expressing the hope that this conversation had been useful and that His Highness would use his influence with his Government to make them realise that there were points on which the Bowers could net give way.   If the Turkish Government had the great fortune to recover Asia Minor they mast be prepared to pay the price, and, in return, they mist receive in a conciliatory spirit the proposals that Lord Curzon hoped would emanate from Paris in a short time.                       &apos;    - 6 -2 Whitehall -Gardens, 8.&apos;7.1.    18th.March, 1922.
