IRAQ  OIL,                Circulated by the Secretary of State                       for the Colonies.          The High Commissioner for Iraq, is constantly preasingfor a decision which will mate It possible to prooeed with  thedevelopment of the oil resouroes- of Iraq.   AD he points out,the delay ia causing many difficulties, politioal and financial.The deficit en the working of the Iraq railways this yearmight havo been reduced to a quite email cuia if Oil fuel hadbeen obtainable at a cheap rate, while at tho present momentthere is grave doubt whether the irrigation pumps in tho Baghdadarea, which are essential for tho cultivation of largequantities of wheat and barley, can continue to work unlessthe price ohargsd for kerosine is reduced considerably.  Inthese oir oumsta&amp;ees it Is not surprising that tho I^a^is .and ovon tho better informed Iraq Govornmaat, cannot understand why they are not allowed to proceed with the development ofthe meat important of their natural resources;  and whatespecially puzzles them is that it Is His Majesty&apos;sGovernment (who s-tand to gain most frs-m the prosperity ofIraq) who ara delaying- the policy of oil development.

The United  States argumentwould also enable then to  refuse to recognise the Turkish  Oompanyfs  concession on thegeneral  ground  of no.-nopoly,  if in faot theirothar contention, that the Company has nopre-war  concession^  is found untenable.&quot;     . Itr seems $hat there  are throe courses open to  His:. Majesty1 s&apos;- Government.; -     d)  To abandon  tho  Turkish          Petroloum florapaay^ claim.     (Z)  To agree to the United States ,          proposal that the Turkish          Petroleum Company&apos;s claim should          bo submitted to arbitration.     (3)  To indues, the United States          Government  by some means            (a)  to recognise,the  Turkish     -       -   Petroleum Company&apos;&apos;s  claim                as valid and            (b)  not to object to  it as  .    ..      :  momopolistio^ 5&apos;-       .
These alternatives may be considered in order:-(l).   It would be very difficult to abandon a claim which H*M* Government have upheld so strongly and withso much publicity.   Thia alternative cannot be regardedfavourably.(2).   If abandonment of the claim is rejected It wouldbe impossible, it is understood, for HYM.Government torefuse to submit the points in dispute to arbitration ifthe United States Government continued to insist.   H.M.Government, though they maintain that the Turkish Petro-petroleum  Company&apos;s rights are sound,-.admit ,that they were notacquired by the procedure which governed the acquisitionof ordinary concessions in Turkey before the war, and itis not possible to say that the result of arbitrationwould be.   The highest legal opinion has.been obtainedprivately combat the Turkish Petroleum Company, and it amounts in effect to this:  that the claim,, although indubitablyjustified by abstract considerations of equity, restsupon a diplomatic rather than a legal basis.       If the finding; of the court went against the Turk-Ish Petroleum Company, the field of oil enterprise in Iraqwould be open to concessionaires of all nations.   It istrue that H.M.Government are probably in a position toget from  the Iraq Government a concession controlled byBritish subjects, but to have to do so-would place H^.Government in a most invidious position vis-a-vis the.United States, while if they did. not wish to use their influence in this direction, or if their ^efforts werefrustrated by methods which are  mown to be familiar tothe Standard Oil Company, we might  find ourselves forced.to accept a situation which, left the  control of the oil resources In Iraq In  the hands of non-British Individual aor companies-
                On the other hand, if the verdict of the Court were         favourable to the Turkish Petroleum companies,r. the American         Government would still be in a position to argue,  and         with  some force, that tho concession was monopolistic in-         character and diametrically: opposed to -Article 11  of the         draft mandate for Iraq,  vtfiich precludes the exercise of         discrimination by Iraq against the nationals of other         states....  -              - .                Vie seem&apos; therefore to be driven back  on  the  third         alternative, and this course has been closely  considered         by  the Departments  concerned.   The,situation  is  summed up         very  clearly in the Foreign Office memorandum  of  December         20th.                ,l0ne possible method, already  considered by the         Colonial  Office, is given in Mr.Wins ton  Churchill!s letter.P.3077.  to  the Secretary to the  Cabinet of  June  20th  last.    The         object of. the  scheme was to bring  the Turkish  Petroleum         Company!&apos;a claim within  certain  limits, which would give  the         Iraq  Government a  free  hand  to  deal  with oil  areas found.         outside  those  limits end. thus  leave them in a  position  to         grant concessions  to others..    Thus if. the  Turkish Petro-         &quot;-petroleum   Company *.s  claim v.ere  recognised  by, the Iraq. Govern-         :ment, the Company  would have  the  exclusive  right, within         a  certain number  of-years,  to  select  a  number of  areas  of         a  determined-total  superficies  which  they w ould develop,         and to prospD ct, for-oil all  over  the  country.    The;main         -disadvantage  of the scheme  is  its&apos;confirmation of the         monopolistic character  of  the  Companyfs  claim to vhich the         Americans strongly object.,    Further,  the Iraq Government         would be deterred  for  a considerable  period from throwing         open  any area  in  the  country to development by other agen-          oies,&apos; a  situation which could  hardly be in the interest          of the new Administration,  anxious to create,  as&quot;speedily          as possible,  new  and substantial sources of revenue.
       A second course has been&apos;considered&apos;in the depart-ment, nameIjj whether sme understanding on commerciallines might he arrived at&apos; with the Standard Oil company in regard to the .,Mes;Opotamlan oil question, which in theend might tend to dissipate our differences with the UnitedStates Government on  this particular subject.   negotiations might be initiated between  the Turkish Petroleum company and&apos; the Standard-Oil  Company, and an arrangement proposedIn the form  of.an.offer to  the Americans of a participation in the Turkish Petroleum&apos;Company similar to that of theFrench provided for in the  San Remo&apos; oil agreement. i.e.  &quot;either a percentage of the  total output of oil,, or a per-centage of shares in  the Turkish Petroleum Company.Possibly the former,  if the rumour be  confirmed that theAmerican company are  wholly concerned  in trying to  securethe  control  of large  quantities of oil, and that an assur- :anoo of a. constant  supply  of a  definite annual  quantitywould be likely  to prove a  more attractive proposition tothem than an offer  of participation and co-operation in  theactual development/  of the  oilfields..       The holdings in the  Turkish Petroleum  Company are believed to  be.at present  in  the following proportions:-       Anglo-Persian  Oil Go:               50$       British Anglo-Saxon, (Shell)         25%               .... i            ...             J   -       French  (SanRemo agreement )          25&quot;&quot;       The French (ex-German) share is held.at  present onbehalf of H..M. Government..  . A maximum  amount  of 20- of the share capital  Is &quot;reserved;&apos;for&apos;&apos;native participationt.     The offer to the American  company could  not be  lessthan the contemplated French share,  and In view of  the total british holding  of .75&apos;&apos; the  Standard. Oil Company :might  standout  for more,  &quot;&apos;                               :       Such  a  proposal presupposes that the Standard oil company might .&apos;be willing  to entertain  and  accept the.idea of participation:  that,; as a consequence, the                           -m                        United/
United States  Government would no longer dispute the validity of the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s claim:- thattheir objection to the monopolistic nature of the  rights.*rhich that Company wish to  establish would&apos; be weakened,&apos;if  not  entirely waived j&apos; &apos; and  that the  claim&apos; of  the. :   vCompany  would  be  recognised by the Iraq Government&apos;. - -.  -     A  third course  would be  simply an extension&apos;  ofthe second, viz:  if  the idea  of  American participationbe  accepted, the  basis  of participation might be v;idenedso  as to admit of an Italian  inherest :y&apos;-thus further ,wpak-ening objections  based ori the monopoly&apos;point. . . It will-bo  recalled that  in  a correspondence  Of some length,begun   in August  1920,  the  Italian Ambassador pleadedfor some consideration being given to  Italian interests which the Italian Government  feared would  be. adversely affected by  the  operation  Of  the San  Homo  oil agreement,and he  suggested that it might be. possible to ,arrange   ,for Italians  to participate in  any benefits  that ;agree.ment was likely to.  confer  on British  and French oil interests.   In view&apos;, however,  of the: San  Remo  oil&apos; agreement being baaed on the&apos; principles.-..of co-operation and reciprocity,  we  have,  In our replies  to  the italian ambassador,  pointed out that the provisions  of  that agreement&apos;could not  very well be enjoyed by Italian interests unless- they, could&apos; formulate- some concrete . proposals tending: t0: Op-operation and reciprocity in the development&apos;of  existing.oil  interests  situated in whatsoever country,.:  This  condition  referred,  of course exclusively to the  San Remo agreement, but there  would seem to be no hindrance to the  Turkish, Petroleum Company entering, if necessary, into commercial, negotiations with Italian interests, as they would do  with the                                               Standard/  .    &apos;       .         -7-   -    ,        &apos;&apos;  *
Standard Oil Company, with a vie- to participationeither in oil output or in shares *   For instance, under paragraph G of. the San Remo oil agreement, it isprovided that if a private petroleum company he formedto develop the Oil-fields of Mosul and.Baghdad, theNative Iraq Government or other native interests may,if they desirej participate up to a maximum of 20% ofthe share capital.   The French were to contribute thefirst 10$ out of their share, and the remainder was tobe provided by each participant in proportion to theirholdings:  it might be possible to modify this provision,.and give tho Italians a  share out of this nativeallotment,..   In the event. of such a combination beingpossible, It would have an excellent effect on ourrelations with the Italian Government and incidentallymight offer uo assistance in getting them to acceptchanges- in tho Treaty of Sevres as affecting- the tripartite, agreement,..   The combination would- theninclude British, French, American and Italian Interestswith perhaps a small Dutch element as represented bythe Anglo-Saxon (Shell) share In the company..&quot;     The .Colonial Office agree with the Foreign office that the best solution of the difficulty is to be found-in the admission- of American oil interests to participate in the development cf Iraq oil by means of a minority-holding in the Turkish Petroleum Company,   TheDepartment understand that this  view is shared both bythe Petroleum Department and by.the Anglo Persian oil company themselves, who were approached confidentiallyin the matter-,.                                           If this/
    &apos; II this policy is approved by the Cabinet it only remains to consider tho course of action bestadopted to give it effect0     The whole question, was recently oor.slo.erod by an informal Commit too, upon which the foreign Office,Petroleum Department and Colonial Office were represented,,   This Committee wore oi opinion that.however cautiously wordod, anything in the nature of official advances by His Majesty^ Government at this juncture might be interpreted as an aamissioh of laclcof confidence in tho strength of tho TurkishPetroleum Company1^ claim, ana consequentlymight encourage tho lOliorloair. Government to redoubletheir efforts to secure the submission of the matter to - arbitration in the hope of obtaining therebyexclusive oil concessions in Iraq for their own nationals,,     The Committee there fore considered that nogctiat-Icrls .should in. the first instance be conducted on acommercial basis, and they wore impresse-  by thodesirability cf manoeuvring the Standard Oil Companyinto making initial advances, and negotiating some preliminary settlement in tho natter direct with thoTurkish Petroleum Company or tho Anglo-Persian -GilCompany* .  Such a&apos;&apos;; situ. at ion                                         appears
appears actually to have arisen in connection withthe recent negotiations now satisfactorily concluded,between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the StandardOil Company in connection with the North Persia Oil con-cessions and the joint flotation of a Persian loan, in thecourse of whieh a tentative offer of co-operation withthe Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Iraq was made by theStandard Oil Company.      Sir John Cadman and 2 Directors of the Standard  oil company will shortly be arriving in this country from america, and it is not improbable that conversations will shortly be initiated by the Standard Oil Company.which,in view of the favourable atmosphere of co-operation created by the recent North-Persia Agreement, will make it possible for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to negotiate a preliminary agreement with the Standard Oil Company,which, while satisfying the latter Company1s aspirationsin Iraq,, will provide for the maintenance of a majorityholding by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the TurkishPetroleum Company and will ensure that the latter willremain a predominantly British concern.           -    &apos;      when these unofficial negotiations are suffiently advanced Hu&apos;hGovernment would, after securing tho prior approval of the French Government  (who under the SanRemo Agreement have been allotted 25 per cent of the shares of the Turkish-Petroleum Company), be in a positionto resxime the formal exchange of notes with the AmericanGovernment.      In order further to strengthen the position ofH.M.Government under Article 11 of the mandate for Iraq,the advisability of guaranteeing to the Italian Government                                              some
 some  snail  percentage  of  tho  total  output, of Iraq oil wtthout according  a share interest  in the Turkish Petroleum Company,, has been under  consideration,  but  this question is not  of an  urgent  nature and a definite decision may well be poSttoned,Por  the  present tho-Cabinet  are asked only to agree to  the  cdm-ission  of American Oil interests to participation in the develop-.- ment  of  the Iraq oil rwsota^jsshy. means  of a minority holding  in  tho Turkish Petroleum Company-.
