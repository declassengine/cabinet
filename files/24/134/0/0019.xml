Minister of Health--.i*        Tho Minister&apos; of Agriculture and Fisheries in his Memorandum     (C.P.3770) objects to the introduction of the proposed Valuation     and Rating Reforms on the ground that, in their present form,     they would bring about an increase in  the valuations of agricul-     tural land and buildings, and he-claims that there should be no     reform unless it dan bo accompanied by &amp; now differentiation in     the rating of agricultural land and tithes which shall afford    . substantial relief to- agriculture.2.       , There is nothing&apos; in the general scheme of reform proposed by     the Cabinet Committee to prevent further relief being&apos; afforded to   ,  agriculture if this is desired.   It is not intended- that the     scheme for equating&apos;-&apos; existing reliefs, referred -to in paragraphs     47 and 48 of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report, should stereotype     for all time the present reliefs.  Neither is it essential to     the principle of the scheme that the equated reliefs should be     exactly those (suggested, in the Report.               &apos;-  \3*        The proposer -reforms will make it possible, either now or     at any future time,  to alter the percentage without occasioning     the slightest dislocation of the machinery of rating or local    - finance *   And if - it-is thought dosifable to increase the 50 per     cent, relief f or. agribiiltural lond to so me higher percentage, this     can bo done, either, now or&quot; in the future, .without impairing the     general scheme of reformi-,.               -4.        The scheme of reform vfliioh has boon proposed, -adopts     the principle of adhering as closely as possible to the     proportions in which the local burdens are now distributed     between the different classes of -ratepayers;  but, in the ease     of land, there are,  without departing from this principle,                                - 1 4
                                                     Illtwo grounds which might justify the adoption of 55$instead of 50;- in the rural areas.     i. The present average of statutory relief is        actually 51 + 2&apos;- and not 50-.    ii. In practice the actual relief is probably        higher than the statutory relief, as the        rural Assessment Committees have hitherto        been, able to exercise a certain amount of     -   ^discretion in favour of the agricultural        ratepayers,     The extent to which it has been possible forthe Assessment Committees to exercise this discretionhas been limited to the Union and Rural District Councilexpenditure;  it has not been possible  for them to vary the distribution of the burden of County expenditure.     In the 9,000 rural parishes where there are no special rates a:-55$ abatement, for land would mean a re-ductlon of 10&apos;^ in the. values upon which its present3hare of all local expenditure Is calculated, and thiswould probably work out to be of greater value to theagricultural ratepayers than the irregular reliefs whichthey now obtain in connection with some of the localburdens.  ..     It Is true that an increase in the percentage al-lowance unaccompanied by.  any Increase In  the exchequer grant would, as the Minister&apos;of Agriculture points out,fail at present to give the relief for which he asks,because&apos; in those par I ajae-s whore the farmers pay thebulk of the rates the relief which it would give tothem would be hardly appreciable.  : On  the other hand theproposed scheme of rating reform   jould alter the positionvery materially.  : By making the District instead of the parish  the unit for rating purposes,  it  would bring  theposition in the Individual rating  areas into/
much closer re la tion &apos; to  the  average.    This  reform wouldin fact relieve  the problem  of  those  cases  in whichthe present system of rating me Ires  it most  difficultto assist the farmers.       In &quot;connection  with  the well-founded  complaint that the reliefs recently  granted  in  connection withthe rating&apos; of tithes  hove  the effect  of increasing theburden of other  ratepayers in rural&apos; areas  to a  consider-         .  ...  .....  .  . ........ , ., ,                s. d.able extent (amounting in  one case&apos;  to ho less than 2* 7in the pound), it &quot;is  important  to recognise  the extentto which the protiosed ratinr reforms  remove&apos; this grievance.,Py cancelling that part  of each precept which&apos;relates to- -unproductive  rateable value  it removes  the&quot;, cause whichhas: done&apos;most to bring about these  exceptional  increases,This change&apos;, combined&apos; with&apos;&apos;the  substitution&apos;of  the Districtfor the--Parish as the- rating unit,&quot;brings&apos;  this &apos;temporarybuMen down&apos;-to./about  2: pence&apos; in the &apos; pound ,  and  practicallylimits it&quot; to -3 pence  in  the  worst&apos;&apos; cases.&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;       Agalfi the economies vhich&apos;the  scheme&apos; would effectare proportionately much greater inr the&apos;rural than in&apos;the&quot; urban areas.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; &apos;&quot;&apos; :&apos;-&apos;- &apos;-  &quot;--   &apos;   -                     &apos;      &quot;:i. &quot;h.eh the annual., humber of -rural rates  has been       -&apos;-- reduced from about 30,000.to about 1,300,  100,000       ;&quot;  a year is &quot;a modest&apos; estimate &quot;of the&quot; saving Which    -  -  would be effected on&apos; bocks and stationery alone * .r-&quot;&quot;&apos; &quot;lit There.  would Eventually be&quot;: cons iderably &quot;greater &quot;- ::    .saving In the  cost of  clerical&quot;and -colletting          -work,  which would he &apos;in the &quot;hands  of  a moderate          number : of trained  of fleers &quot;ihatead of an-army of v : -   -- part-time assistants&apos;.          :&apos;-&quot;-            &apos;. ---ill-..

Bat. probably the greatest saving, of all  in  the rural            areas would be the great reduction, in the  cost  of  ob-            taining.professional valuations and of supporting  them            in the Courts., with.-expert witnesses,                                                 J V         These and other savings.effected  by the proposed simplifi-    cations should, be as valuable, to the agricultural  ratepayers as    a material increase in the Agricultural Ratqs grant, and th:-s    benefit would como without any., cost to the. taxpayers.&apos;9.&apos;.      It-is not suggested that, the Rating arid Valuation  reforms    proposed by-the. Cabinet Committee include any direct proposal  to    extend further relief, to-the agricultural ratepayers, nor  yet    that these, reforms would operate in. their, favour  to  an  extent  at    all equal to that proposed by the.Minister of Agriculture.         On the.-other hand it- may be. claimed:..-.         i.&apos; That. the scheme of Rating .Reform would protect  the- agri--  -            cultural ratepayers from any, increase of  burden.        ii.\That. ;the rating, reforms, (which include, a  proposal  to  plioe            the,relief -granted by the Agricultural. Rates Act,  1896,            upon-;a.permanent --instead -of an annual basis, leaving  the            Exchequer.-grant -cpnneoted therewith untouched)  do  hot            place, any difficulty in the.way of. an extension of this            relief,., but:. in. fact: make... amendment. in this direction  a            somewhat-;.simpler, matter.:       iii*. That: certain.-; of. the. reforms/ viz,, the adoption  of  the            District;; instead,; of .the. Parish as the rating unit,  and the            amendment- of the Precepting. system would  remove  several            grievances, in; regard-, to. inequitable distribution  of            burdens,,, including - that connected., with, the tithe  rate            re lie fs, re cently...-granted,.,        IT.. That the. great simplifications. In the rating  system would
   effeot a series of eocnomios in local administration whioh   would tell materially in favour -of the rural rate-payers.v, That, if the equatod scale of -relief includes an   allowance of 55$ (instead of50$-$.- for agricultural   ratepayers in rural areas, the-farmers.would actually   realise a 10$ reduction in their present rating burden,   without any extra charge upon the taxpayers, nor any  .extra charge upon other ratepayers, assuming that the   economies referred to in. IT, above amount to  370,000   a year, which.is probably a modest estimate.                     -  (Sgd.) A,. mond,Ministry of Health,   8th March, 198B,V
