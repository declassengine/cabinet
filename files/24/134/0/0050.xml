PROPOSED DRAFT TO LETTER TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, LEAGUE OF NATIONS, GENEVA.

Sir, 

His Majesty&apos;s Government have received, and had under consideration, your letter of January 17th (C.L.3, 1922) calling their attention, by direction of the Council of the League, to the Recommendations adopted by the Second Assembly on October 1st, 1921, on the subject of the limitation by members of the League of expenditure on naval, military and air forces during the  next two financial years.

2. I am happy to be able to inform you that the further economies foreshadowed in the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government dated June 2nd, 1921, to the similar Recommendation of the First Assembly, have proved capable of realisation and the forthcoming estimates to be presented to Parliament of expenditure on the defensive services of the United Kingdom will demonstrate the very considerable reductions in all directions provided for during the next financial year.

3. As pointed out in the letter of June 2nd, 1921, above mentioned the policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government on the question must be liable to reconsideration if the recommendation of the Second Assembly is not adopted by other Powers.
