[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maiesty&apos;s Government.]POLICY OF CALLING UP THE AIR FORCE  RESERVE IN TIMES OF                            CIVIL UNREST.    THE Air Ministry are in entire  agreement with the views  expressed  by theAdmiralty in OP. 3471 and by the War Office in CP. 3646 as  to the policy of callingiap the Reserves in time of civil unrest    The Air Force Reserve will consist of two sections-    Section  I. Airmen enlisted for  a period  of regular and reserve service who aretransferred  to the Reserve on the  completion of their regular service  or  on beingpermitted to convert the remainder of their total engagement into  service in theReserve.  The appi&apos;oximate present  number is 5,600, whilst it is estimated that thestrength on  the 1st April next will be 5,666.    Section  II. Airmen who, after  completing the  period  of service  for which theyoriginally enlisted, enlist  or  re-engage for service  in  the  Reserve.   At present, noairmen have been or are being enlisted into the Section II of the Reserve.    The pay of Reservists is  Is. a day, an extra sum of 10L a year being granted toN.C.O. pilots, subject- to compliance with  the regulations in regard to flying training.    The considerations advanced by the Admiralty and  War Office in regard to the disturbance  and hardship caused by the calling up of  the  Reserves in the recentemergency apply equally to the Royal Air Force Reserve.  Should it become necessaryin future to obtain volunteers for Section II  of the Reserve, the impression that theReserve is likely to be mobilised in times of civil unrest will probably give rise to somereluctance on the part of airmen to engage in the Reserve, and may make it necessaryto increase the inducement to enlist.     The majority of R.A.F. Reservists are skilled mechanics and craftsmen, who do not take  kindly to  j)olice duties, which  are foreign to their normal Air Force employment.From reports called  for  by  the Air Ministry on the  termination of  the last civilemergency,  it appeared that where reservists were employed in their proper Air Forcetrades, they generally worked  well and  showed  great keenness ;  but that whereemployment in normal Air Force  duties could not  be found for  them, they becamediscontented.   It is  considered,  therefore,  that  so far as technical personnel  areconcerned, it will  be  a strain on the goodwill which  is so necessary in any Reserveforce to call them out to undertake purely police duties.     In  the opinion  of the Air Ministry  it is very desirable  that, while the presentliability of the Royal Air Force Reserve to be called out in time  of  civil  unrest shouldcontinue, only such numbers  in such  grades .shall be called out  as  maybe deemed necessary to carry out such actual additional flying  duties as  may be  imposed on theRoyal Air Force by reason of the emergency.SECRET.CP.  3806.CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR AIR.F. E. G.Air Ministry, March 3, 1922.[7978]
