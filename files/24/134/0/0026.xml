Private and personal.   PalestineBritish gendarmerie.   Since sanding ay telegram No.51 of  tho14th February I have been considering further tho question ofthe Incidence of cost of the new force.    355 , 000 has beeninoluded in provisional estimates as a grant in aid fromBiitish Government for thia service to meet cost of equipment,and sea transport as well as recurrent expenditure for theyear.   I am strongly impressed on further reflection, however,with the difficulty of Inducing parliament to accept thischarge on the British taxpayer.   You are w6ll aware ofgeneral financial situation in this country and of extremepressure upon Hie Majesty&apos;a Government to reduce expenditurein every direction.   Every penny of my estimates will bescrutinise a closely &quot;by critics of Government and unlessadequate justification can be found no charge will be soaaptod.In both Houses of Parliament there is growing movement of hostility, against Sionist policy  in Palestine, which will be stimulated by recent northcliffe articles.

ifgrant in aid figuring in estimates was  to  be  foreseen.Only reason in favour of decision for grant  in  aid  seemsto have been that  officers otherwise would be  liable toBritish income tax but as they  are paid from British fundsit aoeaa right that they should pay income tax.

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner of Palestine to the Secretary of State for Colonies.

Dated 6th March, 1922.

(Received Colonial Office 2.23 p.m. 7th March, 1922).

6th March, 1922. Private and Personal.

The Strained purport of your telegram of March 2nd I observed with great regret. The establishment of a British Gendarmerie here was never asked for by the Palestine Government nor was a grant-in-aid for its pay over suggested. You desired the creation of such a force as part of the British garrison and showed that by substituting it for an equivalence in Indian troops the cost of the force would be covered. To this I agreed. The British tax-payer was involved in no additional charge. Next, it was decided owing to recommendation of your departmental committee, that this force should be paid by Palestine Government which would be recouped by a grant-in-aid. Although I failed to understand the reason and foresaw the great political objection of presenting estimate to Parliament for any grant-in-aid to Palestine Government for any purpose I did not demur to this. It is now being made to appear as though British Government were being asked to undertake the burden of paying for a Palestine Government force: but this is a complete misrepresentation of the situation.

2. You have asked what economies would be necessary to meet cost of Gendarmerie - £355,000 Egyptian - being £100 per man. Excluding railway posts and telegraphs, Turkish and other debtor charges the estimated expenditure of Palestine 1922-23 is £1,371,000. Already devoted to public security £310,000. Revenue, customs, general administrative and minor departments and miscellaneous have
been reduced to minimum of  599,000 Egyptian already.There is left  454,000 after deducting this as possiblefield for appreciable economies.    The entire suppression of public health education agriculture and antiquitiesdepartments cost,of which together involve total oxpondi-ture of only  277,000 would be involved in order to  findsum required for gendarme rip,    Further the reductionof public works expenditure from  150,000 to  72,000yielding  78,000 would ba necessitated.    3*  This is not s stage in British administration ofPalestine when we can raise additional revenue by increasingthe heavy taxes imposed by Turks  and continued by us withslight modifications.    4.  Policy of stopping all usefulness of Governmentalactivities and of using the money of-Palestine tax-payerswithout their consont for the  payment of British forces would result in any hopo of this  Government winning  their confidence and goodwill being absolutely destroyed and  theestablishment of a regime of Government against the  will ofthe people would result which would oost far more in military requirements -than any sums now in question.    5*  The policy proposed would run counter to everyassurance that I have givon to the people of Palestine  and i could not under any consideration take personal responsi-bility for its execution.    6.  Apart from tho u happy decision to insert aPalestine grant in aid in estimates  I still fail to see how this question has arisen at all.    7..  Large economies in expenditure on garrison were accepted by Cabinet  as shown by proposals in your memorandum
to Cabinet dated November 29th and no alteration in expenditure involved has since been made. I would strongly  

urge the elimination from estimates of the grant-matter-in-aid and the payment of the British gendarmerie in the same way as rest of British force here. This may be an exceptional course but Palestine is not a colony or protectorate and the exceptional measures may be justified by the difficulty of finding any alternative.

8. Please remember that with the £100,000 which we are already finding we have created a really officient force of 500 local gendarmerie 300 of which are mounted. As revenue has not shown expansion I have not been able to increase this force this year but marked signs of economic revival are now forthcoming and I anticipate that unless unforeseen adverse circumstances develop in financial year 1923-24 I can find an equal sum which will make it possible for this force to be doubled and the British garrison to be reduced by an equivalent number of men almost equal to numbers of new British gendarmerie.

I have of course no objection should you wish it to the circulation of this telegram in whole or in part to Cabinet.
