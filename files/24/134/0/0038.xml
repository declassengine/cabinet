NATIONAL HKALTH INSURANCE BILL.ET.                              &apos;&quot; &quot;&quot;                         N.H.I.  10..3838.        Memorandum by the Minister of Health,1.          In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on    the recommendations of the Geddes Committee I had given    notice of a Bill to provide for an increase in the rates    of contribution under the National Health Insurance Acts and    otherwise to amend the Acts with a view to relieving the    Exchequer of, -         (1) the special grants, amounting approximately to              1,700,000 per annum, towards the cost of medical             benefit in excess of the statutory proportion of             two-ninths;         (2) part of the cost of the administration of medical             benefit, amounting to  100.000 per annum;  and         (3) the annual grant to the Women!s Equalisation Fund,             amounting in the present year to  350,000.2.          I have,..however, recently conferred with the Gon-    consultative Council of Approved Societies on the matter and    find that the Council, who are fully representative of all    types of Approved - Societies, are unanimously of opinion that    any attempts to increase the rates of contribution at the    preseiit time would meet with the most serious opposition    from all quarters.   They fully realise/however, the    imperative need for economy and they have offered on    (behalf of Approved Societies throughout the country, to    accept a scheme under which the whole of the savings    to the exchequer would bo secured without any additional    contributions at the present time.3,           Under the Societies&apos; proposals the whole of the    excess cost of medical b/enefit ^t present met out of special    Exchequer grants would,; as from. 1st April, 1922, be charged
    on the exist ins;  benefit  funds  of  Societies  during  the    continuance of the  present  contract  with  the  medical    profession.   This  contract expires  In December,  1923,    and the Societies hope that by that  time  it may be    possible so to reduce the cost of medical benefit    as to make it possible to meet the charge out of    current Insurance funds.4.           The Societies also agree to the  proposal  to    abolish the present annual grant  to  the Women&apos;s Equall-    sation Fund  as  from the end of the  present financial    year and to provide for  the special  risks of  married    women by increasing their reserve values  and  slightly    prolonging the life of the.Reserve Values Sinking  Fund.    It should be noted  that  this proposal is  permanent    and not subject  to  the time-limit of 31st December, 1923.5.           The offer  of  the Societies  does  not  extend.to the    relief of the Exchequer  from the  grant made under  Section    1(2) of the National Insurance Act,  1913, towards  the    cost of the medical treatment  of  old and  disabled members    of Societies who were not eligible to become  insured    under the National  Health Insurance  scheme.    This grant    will therefore have to be continued.   The  total  amount    involved is, however, trifling, amounting to  less  than     2,000 for the coming  financial year, and Is  a rapidly    diminishing quantity.    Provision for this  has been made    In the Estimates.&apos;6,          I have consulted the Government Actuary,  who  in-    forms me that, although  he would be  unable to advise  that    the funds of Approved Societies could bear  the. extra    burden as a permanent measure, he has no  hesitation in    advising that in view  of the considerable surpluses which    have been accumulated Societies pan  quite safely  bear    the charge involved until December,  1923.
          I am satisfied that the proposals of the societies provide a satisfactory solution of theImmediate difficulty;  and in my judgment they havetaken a wiso and statesman-like view of the whole matter,and have shown considerable.public spirit in the offerthey have made.   I consider that this offer should beaccepted and I have^ therefore, had a Bill drafted togive effect to the. -proposals..   A copy of the draft ,3111is attached.          I would c&amp;ll attention particularly to Clause 2(2)of the draft Bill.   .Under the financial scheme of theInsurance Acts two-ninths of the cost of all.benefits - is paid by. the Exchequer.   Under their proposals,&apos; however,Societies would, find the whole :of the excess charges for medical benefit and for the time being would lose thestatutory two-ninths  grant which they, would have receivedhad the funds used In this way been distributed in theordinary course to pay benefits or additional benefits under the Acts.   It is clear that the propered use ofaccumulated funds for&apos; the relief of the Exchequer ought not to deprive the Societies of the two-ninths grantpermanently and it is., therefore., proposed that theState grant of which Societies, will.be&apos;  temporarily ;&apos;deprived, amounting  approximately to  700,000 during the twenty-one months to December, 1923,, should be credited to each Society with the accrued interest after the dateOf its next valuation in instalments as nearly as possiblecorresponding to the sums applicable in the&apos; ordinary course towards the cost of the additional benefits whichwould have been provided by the sums now proposed to. beOtherwise used.          The draft  Bill contains special, provisions&apos;  forits application to Scotland and Wales which are necessary
           by reason of the  fact  that certain annual  charges  in           connection with medical  benefit  amount  to  a  somewhat           greater sum per head in  those  countries than in           England. :      10.            Ireland is excluded  from the  scope of the Bill.           In the case of Northern  Ireland  it Is understood that           an exactly similar measure will  be submitted, to the  ......           Parliament of that country, while in the  case of  the           Free State it is  not thought desirable,, in view of the           present position, to legislate in the  Imperial Parliament           for matters which may be expected in the immediate future           to be excluded from the  jurisdiction of that Parliament.      11.            I should be glad to  have the  authority of the           Cabinet to introduce a Bill on the lines of  the. draft           attached.
