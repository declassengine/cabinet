[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                 Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1922.CP. 3863.THE CANADIAN CATTLE  EMBARGO.                       GOVERNMENT PLEDGES.    THE pledges given by us  to  Canada that  this embargo would beremoved are of a very serious and definite character.  The hrst was given at the Imperial  Conference of 1917.  Sir Robert Borden, then  PrimeMinister  of Canada, raised the question on the 26th April, 1917, pointing out that  while the  British Government were perfectly  free  to pass anyprotective measure they chose, they ought not to achieve this on a pretextwhich  threw an  unjustifiable  stigma of disease upon  Canadian  cattle.Thereupon Mr.  Prothero, Minister of Agriculture, made the  followingremarks:                     Imperial War Conference, 1917.        &quot; Mr. Prothero: .  . .  . As far as  I personally am concerned,  and    so far as the English Board of Agriculture is concerned, after the war    is over, of course, because it is not an  economical mode  of  bringing    meat to this country  during the  war to bring over  live animals, we    should be wise to remove the embargo,  and I  think for this reason in    the main.  The home demand for store cattle in the  eastern counties    has been rather imperfectly met for many years past. On the other    hand, there has been a considerable  increase in breeding in  this    country; but if we have, what I think we shall have, a large extension    of  the arable  farming in this country,  we shall want to increase  our    store cattle.  Of course, your Canadian cattle will come over as what    we call &apos; stores -that is to say, they are to be fed and fatted here in    England.  We shall want a great many more store cattle if  we have    this great extension of arable farming;  we shall want more animals    to trample the straw and eat the root crops.  At the same time, there    are signs that we shall not  get the same amount of  store cattle from    Ireland as heretofore.  You will understand I do not know whether    there is  a representative of the Irish Department here that   the    main  opposition, at  least  one  strong line  of  opposition, to   the    introduction of Canadian stores is that the  Irishman is  afraid that    it is going to  cut into his  trade  in  store cattle  with  this  country.    Well, Ireland is advancing most rapidly in its agricultural development.      [8067]                                                     B
    If we get cattle from Ireland they will increasingly come over here in    the form of finished, fully fed cattle.  Therefore, the supply of Irish    store cattle is likely to diminish, and in that case  again the fact that    we can turn to Canada for store cattle will be of great advantage to us,    and  I can assure  you that so far as the English  Board of Agriculture    is concerned, we are in favour of the removal of the embargo.  We do    not believe that there is now, or has been  for a good many years past,    the slightest ground to exclude Canadian cattle on the score of disease.    I do not know I am afraid you know a great deal better than I do     but any statistics I have seen as to disease in  Canada show me that    you have been remarkably free from it. . . .         &quot;Sir Robert Borden: Yes, and the members  of the late Adminis-    tration held that view; the Canadian Minister of Agriculture 1 am quite    sure held that view. If it is desired to protect the cattle industry hi    the United Kingdom, let  it be done; that is a matter  of  domestic    concern; but do not accomplish it by the  enforcement of a regulation    which casts an undeserved shir upon conditions  in Canada.         &quot; I am sure we  are all very much obliged to Mr. Prothero  for the    sympathetic consideration he has given to the subject, and, as it is a    matter of sentiment with us as well as a matter of material con-    sideration, 1 hope it may  be possible for him to  reach the conclusion    that it is not necessary to await the termination of hostilities before    taking action for this purpose;  but  that, of course, is  for him to    decide.  I only offer a strong suggestion along that line.&quot;         &quot; Mr. Prothero: . . . . if wo do take any action I do not see why    it should not be taken at  once, especially if we  cannot  put  it into    operation until after the war is over.&quot;         &quot;Mr.  Rogers:  How  do you  mean,  you  cannot  put  it  into    operation ? &quot;         &quot; Mr.  Prothero : Because there are no ships.&quot;    Nothing  could be more clear and unequivocal than the above state-men ts.   The  sole reason for not acting immediately upon them was theshortage of shipping, which made it impossible to import livestock  by sea;but the  subject was  summed up  by Mr. Long in the following  unmis-takeable  terms:                     Imperial  War Conference, 19 ! 7.         &quot; The Chairman (Mr.  Long): However, now the position  is that    the restriction is to be removed, and the Board  of Agriculture will    take such steps as are necessary for this purpose, but upon the under-    standing that, there being no tonnage, there cannot be any arrivals.&quot;         &quot;Mr. Rogers: I do not want to have any/understanding about it    If there is no tonnage, that follows.&quot;
         &quot; The Chairman : No, I do not want it to be a misunderstanding.&quot;         &quot; Sir Robert Borden :  It cannot become  effective because there is    no tonnage.&quot;         &quot; The Chairman: We  cannot do it;  I  am quite sure  that the    Shipping Controller would stop it  at once, and he woidd say: &apos; We    cannot let live cattle come because they take up too much room.&apos; &quot;         &quot; Sir Robert Borden: We  perfectly understand that.&quot;         &quot;Mr. Rogers: Yes, but still, we do not want to be  placed in a    false position.  This is an old sore and an old grievance, and now is    the  proper time to have  it cured, because  the facts are all in our    favour.&quot;         &quot;The Chairman:  The Minister of Agriculture has  undertaken    to do it.&quot;    The end  of the  war came,  but no attempt was  made by the  Board ofAgriculture to redeem its pledge.   The  subject was, therefore, raised  byMr. Meighen  at the recent Imperial Conference.  Mr. Meighen  referredto the promise which had been made in the following words:          &quot; Mr. Meighen  : On  pp. 219 and 222 of  tho  Minutes of Pro-    ceediugs  of the  Imperial War Conference  of  1917 you will find that    Sir  Robert Borden and Mi&apos;. Rogers raised  this  question on behalf of    Canada,  and that  Mr.  Prothero,  the President  of the Board  of    Agriculture,  and  Mr. Walter  Long,  Colonial  Secretary  and the    Chairman of the  Imperial War Conference, while in favour of the    removal of the embargo, took  the position that it could not well  be    removed  then because, in the  scarcity of ships, the Admiralty and    the  Shipping Committee could allot no vessels for  the  carriage  of    cattle.  They did, however, in response to  argument, agree that  as    soon as possible after the war it would be  removed, and the words    &apos; as   soon as  possible&apos; are clearly applicable  only to the  shipping    conditions and to no other: that is to say, when ships were available    after the war the embargo on the  admission of  cattle  was  to  be    removed.  It was even suggested that a resolution should be passed    to that effect, but the chairman assured the  Canadian representa-    tives that  a resolution was unnecessary,  as a promise had  been    given.   That promise has  not been  carried out as yet,  though    I  venture to say  that  the conditions  for  carrying  it out  have all    transpired.   The shipping conditions certainly are such  that  cattle    can   be transported  now, and  consequently  there  is  no  reason,    I submit, why the promise should not be fulfilled.&quot;    To this the Prime Minister replied as follows :         &quot; Mr. Lloyd George :  We  decided to refer  the whole question to    a perfectly impartial Royal Commission, a Commission which would      [801! 7 J                                                  B 2
        be impartial in  the  sense  that it would have no interest represented        on it.   Of  course,  there  are very  powerful  interests  which are        concerned in the removal  of the embargo, as there are interests, on        the  other  hand, which are concerned in retaining the embargo, and        we felt that if we had a Commission which represented interests we        should only have a report which would  be either a  majority or a        minority report as the case might be, but the findings of which would        merely represent the interests involved, and that  there would be no        guidance for us from the  general  point  of view.  It was decided,        therefore,  to have  a perfectly impartial   Commission.  It  was  a        Commission which  has been accepted by all the interests concerned        as being a very  fair one.  We have done our best  to give every        facility to  all those  who are concerned to  present their case.  The        report has not yet come in.  When it comes in it will be our duty        to act upon it, and  in  considering that report we should certainly        bear  in mind the  quotation  which Mr.  Meighen has  given the        Conference from a previous discussion where Sir Robert Borden was        present and put the  case for Canada.&quot;        I  have heard it suggested that the words &quot; and act upon  it &quot;left us    an option either to accept or  reject the  advice  of the Royal Commission.    It seems to me that it  is clear  from  the context that the impression    conveyed,  and intended  to  be conveyed, was that  we would act in    accordance with the Report of the Royal Commission.   I do not see how    this can  be contested, in view  of the words used by the Prime Minister*   in a sentence just before  giving the pledge:             &quot; Yes, I thoroughly realise  that.  I know, and I  have had it in        my mind, and so have all my colleagues, that that  pledge was given        by Mr.  Walter Long and by the  then  Minister  of  Agriculture,        Lord Ernie.  That pledge  is very clear, and it is unequivocal.  It        was undoubtedly the intention of the Government to act upon it at        the earliest possible  opportunity.&quot;        I  really do not envy any man who tried to explain away in public the    sense and intention of the double series of  pledges.   They mean, were    meant to  mean, and could only mean,  that  if the Royal Commission    reported against the embargo, we  should remove it.        The Commission has now reported.   It has advocated unequivocally    and unanimously the removal of the  embargo.  Surely then  we are    bound in honour, however inconvenient, to carry out our pledge to Canada.    Mr.  Meighen is known to be  in communication with the present Prime    Minister of Canada, and is  pressing strongly for the fulfilment  of the    pledges given him.  I should like to know what answer it  is  suggested    can  be made on the question of good faith.   It must  be borne in mind    that the  Prime Ministers pledges were given openly in  Conference in the
presence of his principal colleagues, who are therefore equally bound to implement them.    Quite apart from this lies the domestic question.   Certain parts ofthe country and certain industries have  a strong interest in keeping outthe Canadian cattle.  Others have an equally strong interest in allowingit  to come  in.   The  question  has  been  referred  to  the  impartialCommission, and the impartial Commission has decided in favour of thosewho wish the cattle to come  in.  However, the opposite policy has been announced by the Minister of Agriculture, following a Cabinet discussion the decision of which is wrongly and inadequately recorded.  The questionit  seems is  not  to be decided in accordance with our pledged word. Itis  not to be decided on its scientific merits, i.e., according to the findings of  the impartial  Commission.  How then is it to be decided&apos;?  I submit that it can only be decided by a free vote of Parliament; and here happilythere is  some justification.   Speaking in  the House of Commons on the16th March, 1921, the Prime  Minister stated that this  question must bedecided by the House.  In  answer  to a question by Major 0&apos;Neill as tothe effect of a pledge &quot;given  in this way at a conference  by a Minister,which  pledge,  to  be  carried out, requires subsequent legislation,&quot;  thePrime Minister said :          &quot; I  agree.  It was given  definitely by the Colonial Secretary, the    right honourable  Member  for  St. George&apos;s,  and  the  present Lord    Ernie, who was then Minister of Agriculture.  Both gave very definite    pledges on behalf of tlie Cabinet.    I  agree it is  a  matter for the    House of Commons to decide, and  if  the House of Commons is to    consider the  question, I  think it would be very considerably assisted    by a perfectly impartial  enquiry.&quot;    I submit  that this  is the course we ought to take, and the only one,in  all the circumstances, open to us.   It  is not  a  strict  fulfilment of ourpromise, but it does undoubtedly remit  the responsibility to the Houseof  Commons and  liberates us from the very unpleasant position in whichwe now stand.  Moreover, this  course would appear to  be  excusable, oreven justifiable, on its own merits.  The interests  and localities concerned are numerous  and diverse;  they conform to no party groupings; some parts of the country  want  one thing,  some  the other.   It is really  aquestion where constituencies have  a right to  expect  their  Members tovoice their special interest, and no doubt that is what members will do inall parts of the country.  I think it is indispensable that Ministers shouldhave a  similar liberty.  In  my own case, relying on  the  pledges whichhad been given and the report of the Commission, I have already declaredmyself, in the  autumn  of  last year, in favour  of  the removal  of  the embargo.   I cannot  possibly go back  upon that.  I  am  being most strongly pressed  by numerous interests in Dundee,  and  by both  theLiberal and Conservative Associations,  to state  my position, and I shallvery shortly have to do so.
    The naked truth is that the Board of Agriculture, having got hold ofa little bit of protection, wish to stick  to  it, irrespective of the pledges given to Canada  and without  regard to  the  scientific  merits  of thequestion as  determined by the impartial Commission.   Such a positionis  indefensible, and  the  matter can now only  be  submitted  to thedead-weight  vote  of  the  interests concerned.  This is also the  easiestcourse from  an electioneering point of view, as the Government will notbe forced to choose between  one set  of supporters and another, and the candidates can take the line which is individually most helpful.                                                          W. S. C.Colonial Office,     March 18, l&apos;)22.
