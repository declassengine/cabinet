Following the breakdown of negotiations the Central       Board of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation met on the       20th March and decided that they would adhere  to their       proposal that the war bonus should be reduced by lC/6d       as from the 29th March and by a further 6/- as from 6th       April, 1922.   notices to this effect will be posted in       the yards tomorrow, 22nd March,   The notice will be in       the usual form announcing an alteration in the rates of       wages.   I have seen officials of the trade unions       concerned.  They have under consideration the  question       of taking a ballot on the employers1 proposals  and will       probably call a delegate Conference on Thursday, 23rd March,       for the purpose of a decision.   In the meantime I am       keeping in close touch with both sides,                                    (Initialled)   T.J.M.       21st March, 1922,
