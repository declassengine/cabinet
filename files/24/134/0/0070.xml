 (tit) The Committee had under  consideration  amemorandum hy  the Minister  of Health  (CP.  3838) covering a national Health  Insurance  Bill.    The Bill, had teen  prepared as &amp; result  of the ehdorse-ment by a Cabinet Committee of  the  recommendation of the C-e&amp;des  Committee  that  the burden  of  National Health&apos; Insure nee falling on the state should  be reduced by increasing the total contributions from employers and  employed by -jjfd ,per -week-&apos; in each case (C.1.3666, Section 18,          )     The Minister of Health in his - memorandum stated that as a result of a conference .vvith, the Consultative Council of Approved Societies it had  been agreed/.&apos; that any&apos;increase at present  in.the rates of  contrib-ution&quot;would be seriously opposed.   In view,  however-,. of the&apos; need for economy  the Societies had agreed; to; - accept &quot;a &quot;scheme which would give, substantial  relief, to the &quot;Exchequer without imposing  any additional contributions  at- the &apos;present  time.    The -amounts  in question are-.-               .                    .  &apos;     ia)  1,700,000 per  annum, /special grants     towards the cost of. medical benefit-In     excess of the statutory  proportion  of     two-ninths.                    &apos;     (b) Part  of &quot;the cost Of  the administration     of medical benefit  amounting,  to   .10.0&apos;,0.00     per annum. -          ..     (c;)&apos; The. annual grant to  the v/oinen s     Equalisation Fund amounting in the  present     year to  350,000. -       .  .               &apos;     The Societies undertook  to &quot;bear  the Miole of the cost of medical benefit  now met. out. of special&quot; Exchequer- grants as. from. 1st  April  1922. to&apos; December 1923      the  present .contract - with.&quot; themedical , profession expires, .  - The.  Societies  :further;&apos;agi-eed to the proposal to abolish  permanently tho  present  , annual grant&apos;&apos; to the Women&quot; s Equalisation.Eundi&apos; &apos;:&apos;&apos;-
        Attoution was drawn by the  Minister of Health in his   memorandum to  Clause 1 (2)  of the  Draft  Bill which&quot; provides   that  the  State grant of two-ninths of which tho Societies   would be  temporarily deprived daring the El months to December   1323  shall be  credited to each Society with tho accrued inter-   est after the  date of its nest valuation.     The Draft bill   dood  not  apply to Ireland end there arc  certain minor   modifications  to make it applicable to Scotland and Kales.        The  Minister of Health informed the Commit toe that the   scheme had the support of the approved Societies, the Insurance   Companies, end the Trade Unions, and that they doubtless hoped   it would  be  possible to reduce the remuneration of the doctors   after-December 1923 and thus make  a demand for additional&apos;   contributions  unnecessary*    With regard to the Womens&apos;   Equalisation Fund experience had shown that the incidence of   women&apos;a sickness was less than had been  anticipated and the   Societies cculd bear the risk without 56ato assistance.        The  Gore2:128)3at Actuary stated that  the Societies had   carried forward, a substantial surplus at the last valuationi                                                        -   and were  it  not for the present widespread and prolocged.   unemployment there would not be  the slightest danger in   shotO.dering tho proposed burden^   In any case he was prepared   to advise that they could bear it.        The  -Financial Secretary of the Treasury pointed out that  &quot;the 3ohem9 proposedjwhile socuring at present the savings   contemplated by the Geddes Committeo; did so by a method which   was not before that Committee or tho Cabinet and was a method   which only gave temporary relief to the  Exchequer.   To carry   out the Cabinefs decision it would be necessary- to provide thatI   on the  termination of the scheme in December 1923 thare would   be no recourse to the Treasury for fresh grants^   Thore woreI   two sources  from which the money could be  obtained: a reductionI   in tho  payments to the doctors) or the raising of contributions.I   He a3kgd  that  tho Committee should embody in the Bill the  principle
that further grants from the Treasury wero tarred.This would, he contends!, greatly strengthen theposition of the Ministry of Health in dealing either with the doctors or the Approve 1 Societies.  It could he a one h;; repealing Section (l) of tho NationalInaurance Adt 1913 (3 &amp; 4- George V. C37)   (Sec Appendix)    &apos;The .-..ini-.ter of Health explained that the Sectionreferred to had boon expressly introduce! owing to an agitation on the part of tho medical profession in orderto enable the Government to contribute more  than  itsproportion of two-thirds and it had the effect  of giving a certain elasticity to  the Minister in bargaining withthe various  interests  involved,,   To take away  the powernow would be to stir up  afresh the controversy  with  the doctors and  to  imperil  the whole scheme of  medical service under  the Actc    The Secretary  for  Scotland suggested  that it  mightbe possible  to  review  tho question at  a later period, butinasmuch as  the scheme  had  the support of all the boards of Health and  the  Societies, it ought  not to bo prejudicedin  tho way proposed by the Treasury, with the certainty  ofprovoking great hostility among tho doctorse    The Financial  Secretary of the Treasury  proposed asan alternative  method  that the Bill should  provide forthe suspension  of  Section (l) of the Act of 1913  untilPar 1 i aroo nt o the rwis e de te r-ra 1 ne d.    The Committee,  agreed:-       10   That tho scheme of  the Minister  of Health          was  the  best possiiblo for securing the  economies          desired  by tho Geddes Committoe having  regard          to  the difficulty of increasing  contributions.,       2.   That inasmuch as the precise -method  of securing          tho  savings  differed^ from that endorsed hy the          Cabinet, tho  forogoing Conclusion  should be          reported to  the Cabinet for  their  approval..Whitehall Gardens,  S,W.,      22nd,  March 19 22,
