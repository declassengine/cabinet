Lord of .the. Admiralty          In the First lordls Statement explanatory of theNavy Estimates 1921-22, dated 18th Maroh, 1921, I announoodthat the Admiralty proposed gradually to reduce and eventually to close Haulbowlina Dockyard, and that we oxpeoted tocomplete the olo3ing of tho Yard during the our rent finanoialyear.          A deputation of representatives from ( ueanstown andthe neighbour hopd, asking for reconsideration of this decision,was received during last summer, &quot;but it was made clear tothorn that it oould not be reversed.          Steps have been taten during the year to carry the approved policy into effect.  Hired workmen have beenreduced from 1100 to 450.  There are 214 Established workmenwho must either he transferred to English Yards or givenretiring allowances under the Superannuation Aot.          On the 84th January, Mr Michael Collins telegraphedto Mr Churchill with regard to instructions that some of the established men were to be transferred to English Yards,and suggested that the Admiralty aotion should be deferred for a month or two.  Ha added              -          &quot;In the interim we may find some means of taking           ovar the Dookyard as a going concern. Situation           rather serious.  Most of the men are married           and obviously their position when they got to           England would be impossible.&quot;          At Mr Churchill^ request, instructions were giv*confer the transfer of the Established men to be deferrede
                                                             10 V                                                 a . . 2          On the 3rd February,  the  Admiral  at Queenstown who wasabout to discharge a further batch  of  the Hired  men, telegraphedas follows          &quot;Provisional Government have wired requesting suspension-           sion of discharges of Hired men  from  Haulbowline           and state they will aooept  financial  responsibility.           Forty fflred men due for  diooharge today,  eleven           mon ana two women on 10th February.  Request in-           struotlons,&quot;          At Mr Churohlll&apos;s request, the discharges  of the Hiredmen were then postponed for a month.,          It became evident, however,  that  the effect  of thesedelays will make it impossible to carry out the  program^.&apos;:  offinally closing the Yard by the end of March.          There is no provision in the approved  Wavy Estimates1922-23 for expenditure at Haulbowline, and the  cost of keeping the Yard open amounts to  15,000 a  month.  The Treasury, whowere consulted, advised that if the Admiralty did not  olosethe Yard, the payment must be met out  of Navy Votes, and recommended that repayment should be asked  for direct  fromthe Irish Free State with the condition of  retaining the men.          Although  the telegram from the Provisional Governmentof the 3rd February stated that they would  aooept financial responsibility, it has not proved possible  to secure any undertaking to provide the mom y in cash from the ProvisionalGovernment, although the matter has been more than once broughtio the attention of their representatives.          The Dockyard is not now required for any Naval purpose,and the retention of the men is a.  dead loss  so far as the-admiralty are concerned.  The effective work now being done thereis negligible and has almost oome to an end.  It is clear,therefore, that the Admiralty cannot on their own responsibilityany\further delay the discharge of the Hired men, the retirement on Superannuation of the Jistablished men, and  the                                                  removal -
removal of the movable stores.          As the question is  partly a political one, I feel itnecessary to bring it before  the Cabinet and, in view of thsurgency, must ask for a very  early decision,                               1 of-P.                             Oth March, 192S*
