I should  like my  colleagues  to have this convenient summary, whicli  has  beenprepared  by  the  Technical  Sub-Committee  of  the Irish Committee, of the agreedarrangements for implementing the Articles of Agreement for  the Irish Treaty duringthe Provisional Government period.                                                              w. s.  c.

[This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                                                          For official use  only.CONFIDENTIAL.CP.  3859.(Also P.G.I.-M.)                                                             8                                  CABINET.PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND COMMITTEE.Note setting out certain Arrangements agreed between British and Irish Ministers    for Implementing, du?&apos;ing the Period of Provisional Government, the Articles    of  Agreement  for  a  Treaty  between  Great  Britain  and  Ireland,  dated    December 6, 1921    1. BRITISH and Iris])  Ministers have discussed  in conference and  have  agree the principal steps which  should  be  taken  to give effect to the  Treaty of the  6thDecember, 1921, during the  period which  must elapse before the  Constitution of theIrish  Free  State can be framed and legalised and a Parliament and Government of theFree State established.  This note sets out, for the confidential guidance of the Depart-ments  affected, the principal decisions  thus  reached  and the general effect of thosewhich have already been carried out.    In so far as matters not  covered by  the arrangements here indicated may come upfor discussion, it has been agreed between British and  Irish Ministers that they  shouldbe discussed and settled in the same manner as those matters which have already been reviewed in joint conference  between them.                          The Provisional Government.    2. In accordance with Article 17&apos;of  the  Treaty,  a &quot;meeting of members  ofParliament elected from constituencies  in Southern  Ireland since the passing of &quot;TheGovernment of Ireland  Act,  1920,&apos; &quot; was held in Dublin on 14th January, 1922, and immediately afterwards a Provisional Government was established.   That Government,however, has had no separate existence in law and its  administrative  authority has,therefore, had to be derived otherwise than from any formal transfer of authority to  it.Its de facto authority has been secured  by an arrangement that the  Lord-Lieutenantshould act upon its advice in  all non-departmental  questions, including any questionrelating to the dissolution of the  Parliament of Southern Ireland, and that he  should further  act, in respect of each service  transferred to the de facto control of an irish minister, upon the advice of that Minister or of the Irish  Government as a whole.    3. &quot; The Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922,&quot; has the effect of giving the forceof law to the Treaty of  tith December and thus of supplying the Provisional Govern-ment, established  under Article 17 of the  Treaty, with  a legal status (section 1 (1)).The Act further enables the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of  its duties to be formally transferred to that  Government by Order in Council (section 1 (2)).It is anticipated that the Provisional Government will immediately constitute depart-ments of government, placing each department under the  direct  control of an IrishMiniste&amp;and assigning to each department  specific functions.  An Order in  council will thereafter be  made transferring to the appropriate department  so constituted eachof the services indicated in this note as  so transferable.                              Transfer of Services.    4. For the present purposes it is convenient to divide the Departments  concernedinto three categories, viz. :          (a.) Purely Irish Departments.         (b.) Revenue Departments.         (c.) Other&apos;Departments having jurisdiction throughout the United Kingdom.       [8031]                         &apos;                                   B
(a.) Purely Irish Departments.    In  general, us indicated above, the purely Irish  Departments  have already beenplaced under the general de facto control of Irish Ministers, and the services for  whichthey are  responsible will shortly be transferred  formally  by Order in  Council to departments  constituted  by the Provisional (government.  The following qualifications,however, will apply to that transfer :       (i.) The Royal Irish Constabulary will be disbanded on  the 31st March, 1922.     (ii.) The transfer of  individual  Resident Magistrates will depend upon the Irish           Government and upon the wishes  of the individuals concerned.    (iii.)  &quot; The Government of  Ireland Act, 1920,&quot; provided (Section 10) that  the           public services in connection with Fisheries and  the administration of the           Diseases of  Animals Acts, hitherto controlled  by the  Department of           Agriculture and Technical Instruction, should be transferred to the  Council           of Ireland.  That Council has not yet been constituted.   ArticLe 13 of  the           Treaty of the  6th December confers on the Parliament of the  Irish Free           State, when constituted, the powers of the Parliament of Southern Ireland           under the Act of  1920 to  elect members of  the Council of Ireland.   The           Parliament of  the  Irish Free  State,  when  constituted, will exercise in           Southern Ireland the powers specified above ;  but, in the event of Northern           Ireland remaining outside  the Free State, the Council of Ireland would in           accordance with Article 12 exercise these powers  in Northern Ireland.   It           was, however  provided by Clause  4  of  the agreement  made between           Mr. Michael Collins and Sir James Craig on the 22nd January,  1922, that           their respective Governments should &quot; endeavour to devise  a more  suitable           system than the Council of Ireland for dealing with&quot; problems affecting all           Ireland.&quot;    Fending the establishment of the Council of  Ireland or the substitution of &apos;&apos; a more suitable system &quot;  for it,  tho  British  Government  will retain their responsibility inrespect of these functions of the Department of Agricultural and Technical Iustructionin Northern Ireland.                     *(b.) Revenue Departments.    The Provisional Government are regarded, under the terms of the Treaty,  as entitledto assume control of the services of the Revenue Departments (i.e., the Board of customs and Excise, the Board of inland Revenue  and the Post  Office) in  Southern  Ireland.These services will accordingly be transferred in  due coarse.by Order in Council tothe Provisional Government, but the existing  Departments at present controlling them[have undertaken I to function  in Ireland as  the agents of the Irish Government untilthat Government is prepared to assume control.(c.) Other Departments  having Jurisdiction throughout the United  Kingdom.    The British Ministry of Pensions will continue to discharge its functions in thepayment of pensions and the provision of medical care to men resident in Ireland.    Arrangements  will  be made between  the  British  and Irish  Governments forthe continuance of  the  special assistance at present afforded to  ex-Service  men inconnection with industrial training, the obtaining of  employment, land settlement  and housing by the Ministry of Labour,  the  Department of Agriculture and  TechnicalInstruction, the Estates Commissioners and the Local Government Board.    The collection  of quit-rents by or on  behalf of the  Office of Woods and  Forestswill continue pending the establishment of the Irish Free State.             ^    The British Government will remain responsible for the administration of railways in Northern Ireland pending a decision in regard to Council of Ireland  services                                   Indemnity.    5. Servants of the Crown and those acting under their authority will be protected by an Act of  Indemnity against legal proceedings for acts done by them in good faithduring  the period  of conflict.  Further,  the Irish  Government have undertaken toprotect, by all means at their  disposal, from  molestation or victimisation the  persons,property and interests of all those who are thought to have sided or sympathised withthe forces of the Crown.
    A Proclamation in the following terms was issued by the Provisional Governmenton the 10th February :          &quot; Now that a Treaty of Peace has been concluded  between the peoples of    Ireland and Great Britain, the Provisional Government hereby decrees a general    amnesty in respect of all acts committed in the course of the recent hostilities.         &quot; This amnesty extends to all members of the  naval, military, police, or civil    services of ihe British Government, and all other persons by whom acts of hostility    against the Irish people were committed, aided or abetted, whether in Ireland or    elsewhere, during the past six years, and the full  protection of the law will be    afforded to all such persons against violence or injury of any kind.         &quot; The Provisional Government appeals to all   Irish  citizens to respect this    amnesty in the spirit and in  the  letter.  In this,  as  in  other matters, we must    not  suffer ourselves to be outdone  by our late enemies in seeking that the wrongs    of the past may,be buried in oblivion.&quot;                        Transfer  of Government Property.                                                                      i    6. All properties  used for the  purpose of ordinary civil government, such asdepartmental offices, etc., together with furniture, equipment and all other departmentalassets, including  the  special  funds wholly applicable to departmental purposes in southern Ireland, will  hi; regarded as Irish property and  handed over to  the IrishGovernment  in clue course;   That Government, without  prejudice to any claims whichmay be made in the general financial adjustment under Article  5 of the Treaty, will assume the liabilities of each Department, together with its assets.    No changes will be made for the present as regards (a) institutions such  as theRoyal Hospital and the Royal Hibernian Military School, (6) the  lands and quit rentswhich constitute part of the hereditary revenues of the Crown, and (c) museums,picture galleries  and  other public  collections  in  Dublin.   It  is  anticipated  that questions arising under (o) will be the subject  of  discussion between Irish ministers and Sir James Craig.    The  Provisional  Government  have  agreed that the  Record Office and  publicrecords should be placed in the control  and  custody of a judicial authority occupying aposition  analogous to  that  of  Master of  the Rolls.   The right of access of accreditedrepresentatives of the  British  Government or of the Government of  Northern  ireland to records not open to public inspection will be  fully secured.   The availability of the records for other  than  strictly departmental purposes will be  governed  by  the samerules  and subject to the same limitations as  are observed in the case of  public recordsin Great  Britain and in the Dominions where practical uniformity  is in force.    Barracks and establishments constructed for police administration in normal timeswill  be included in the transfer  to the Irish  Government.   In the  case of militaryestablishments and police establishments not so specially constructed; the proportion ofthe actual buildings or their value,  which should  be recognised as tlie property of  theIrish  Government, will be arranged in the ultimate settlement  between the  BritishGovernment  and  the  Government of  Ireland.  In the meantime,  as  the  buildingsbecome available the question of their temporary use by the Irish Government will bea matter  for arrangement between the two Governments.    Any surplus movables in military  establishments, and police  transport and other equipment in excess of  normal requirements, will be sold  through, the  agency of  theDisposal  Board, except so far as the Irish Government may seek to acquire them at avaluation.  The proportion of any movables, transport equipment,  &amp;c, to be recognised as the property of the Irish Government will be determined in the ultimate settlementreferred  to above.   In the meantime the Irish  Government undertake the safe  custody of any properties evacuated by the  military and  police until they  have  been dulydisposed of.                              Position of Judiciary.    7. During the provisional  period, the position of existing judges oi the SupremeCourt as regards salaries, pensions and  tenure  will remain unaltered, but vacancies in any judicial posts will be filled in accordance with the advice of the Irish Ministers.The staff of the Supreme Court, so  far as payment of  salaries and  general financial control are concerned, will be transferred  to the  Irish Government, subject  to  theprovisions as to compensation contained in &quot; The Government of  Ireland Act, 1920.&quot;The County Courts and other  subordinate  Courts  will  occupy in relation to the Irish       [8031]                                                          B 2
 Government the same position  as  they now occupy in relation to the British  Govern- ment, existing County Court judges and other persons having the like tenure of office being treated so far as regards personal  rights in the same way as existing judges of the Supreme Court.                                   Compensation.      S. The principle is agreed that fair compensation  should be paid in respect of injuries  which  are the subject of  compensation under the enactments  relating to-criminal injuries, including losses  sustained  through the destruction of property by order of the military authorities under  martial  law.   A special  procedure has been agreed  upon for  dealing  with claims made in respect of  such injuries sustained between the 21st  January, 1919, and the 11th July, 1921, ie., from the date of the formal establishment of Dail Eireann to the date of the truce.  Proceedings in respect of injuries  sustained before  or after that  date  will not be  affected.   The following procedure will be  adopted  in the cases of personal injuries and of injuries to property respectively during the special period named. Personal Injuries.      (a.) Each  Government will deal with  and  be responsible for  the payment of compensation in respect of  personal injuries to its own supporters.      (/;.) Awards already given  will stand.      (c.)  The provisions as to  liability under (a)  will  be  retrospective to apply to awards  already satisfied. Injuries to Property.      (a.) A Commission will be  established consisting of one member appointed  by the British  Government and one appointed by the Irish Government, with a chairman  who holds or has held high judicial office, to be chosen by agreement.      (b.) The Commission will have power to hear and determine all claims in respect of such injuries as albresaid sustained during the period  from the 21st January, 1.919, to the 11th July,  1921, and to review awards already given in undefended cases.  -      (c.) The Commission will have power to appoint agents, investigators and assessors, and have power to compel  the attendance of witnesses  and to take evidence on oath.      (d.) The Irish. Government will agree to assume responsibility for  seeing that all awards of the Commission  and  (subject to such review as aforesaid) the awards of other tribunals in respect of such injuries are duly satisfied.      !e.) The British Government will undertake to reimburse  the  Irish Government for such a proportion  of  the  total amount (including advances  already made  out of intercepted grants) as may be agreed between the two  Governments, the amount  of the damage done to property in  Great  Britain in  pursuance  of the late  Irish  political movement  being brought into account.      (/.) The expenses  of  the Commission will be borne by the Irish Government and the  British Government in proportion to their respective liabilities for sums  awarded by the Commission.      In view of this arrangement, all proceedings in respect of injuries suffered between the  dates  mentioned above (including pending  proceedings  and proceedings for the enforcement of decrees already given) under the enactments relating to compensation for criminal injuries will be barred.  A resolution in this sense has  been promulgated by the  Provisional  Government and will  be followed by  legislation in  the  British Parliament, which will form part of the  Bill of  Indemnity, referred to in the following paragraph.      Statements setting out the foregoing arrangements were made by Mr. Churchill in the House  of Commons on the 22ncl and 24th February (see Hansard, Vol. 150, No. 12, p. 2014, and No. 14, p. 2245).                                      Finance. For the Period up to March 31, 1922.      (a.) The existing Votes, so far as they are  applicable  to Southern Ireland, have  been placed at the disposal of  the Irish  Government for  the purposes for which they  were voted ; and      (b.) An additional sum  of   1,130,000,  representing that portion of  grants  recently withheld from Local Authorities in Southern Ireland which had been diverted
to the payment of Criminal Injury Decrees and other minor purposes, was voted by theHouse of Commons on the 22nd February for the purposes of the Provisional Govern-ment.  This sum is to be taken into account in the general financial settlement betweenGreat Britain and Ireland.After March 31, 1922.    A separate Irish  Exchequer will  be established as from the 31st March, into which will be paid all revenue from  taxes collected from Southern Ireland.   Pendinglegislation by the Irish  Free State, taxes  so  collected will be assessed  and collectedon the same principles  and at the same rates as in  the  United Kingdom.  Duringthe period of agency the postal revenue collected in Southern Ireland will also be paid into the  Irish  Exchequer, the expenditure  being recovered from Irish funds.  Theexisting  stamps have  already  by agreement been  overprinted for use in southern ireland.  It is  agreed that the postal rates and charges in force for  the time  being in Great Britain  shordd  apply to Southern Ireland during the  period of ProvisionalGovernment.  An-angements will be made for a division of the assets and liabilities ofthe Post Office  Savings  Bank and for giving some option to the depositors who openedtheir  accounts  in Irish offices  to remain with the  British  Savings Bank  or to betransferred to the Irish  Bank.     ! ending a definite arrangement for capitalisation, the Irish  Government will beresponsible for  the recovery of payments due in respect of local loans and the collectionof land purchase annuities and for paying over the proceeds to the British Exchequer,together with an amount equal to certain expenditure  still  borne on the British -Votesor charged on  the Consolidated  Fund  of the  United  Kingdom  (e.g.,  pensions of civilservants, payments for any agency services, and salaries of judges).     Payments  on account of the Irish share of the debt will stand over till the amounthas been settled in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty, such payments to be maderetrospectively when the share of the debt attributable to the Irish Free State has been so settled.     March 17, 19?2.
