[This Document is the  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1922.SECRET.CP. 3844.                                                            0iCANADIAN  CATTLE EMBARGO.          MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.    I FEAR I must raise again  the question of the action permissible to individual ministers  with regard to the  embargo on  Canadian cattle.  I understand that  it isintended to treat the retention of the embargo as a matter of Government policy ; butthis was not the interpretation  which I had placed on the result of  the discussion inthe Cabinet of  the 30th January.  Both my personal convictions,  already publiclyexpressed, and my position as representing the interests  of Canada  on the one hand,and of my own constituency on  the other, make it very difficult  for me to acquiesce in the proposed course.    I append  a resolution  which I have   received  from  the  Dundee  UnionistAssociation.                                                                   w. s.  c.    Colonial Office, March 15, 1922.Resolution passed at a Meeting of the General Council of Dundee Unionist Association,                         held on Monday, March 6, 1922.    That the Dundee Unionist Association regrets the decision of the Government in refusing to remove the embargo on the  importation of Canadian store cattle, contraryto the recommendation of the  Royal  Commission  under  the  Chairmanship of LordFinlay, and the pledge given by the Government  at Paris oh the 26th April, 1917,and strongly urges  the Government to remove  the  restriction  as  early as possible,especially in view of the fact that Canada was given to understand by the Governmentthat such embargo would be removed[8044];
