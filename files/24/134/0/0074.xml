[THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS MAJESTY&apos;S BRITANNIC GOVERNMENT].QRET.                            CABINET,                 -  Copy No,^iP*  3874.                     &quot;HOME  GROWN SUO*R&quot; .          Memorandum  &quot;by thet Miniotor, of Agriculture^ and^Fi fisheries*             I  desire  to bring  before the  Cabinet the question of   assisting  to establish the sugar  industry  in this country by   remitting  the Excise Duty charged at present on home produced sugar.             There  are at present  two sugar factories in this country   at Kelham  and Cantley, but both factories  will undoubtedly have to   abandon at once  the manufacture of sugar if the Excise Duty, which   amounts to between   19 and  20  a  ton, remains in force.             For several years  past  special efforts have been made   both by the  Government and by private individuals to establish   the sugar  industry  in this country, and the experiment has proved   that farmers aro ready and anxious to grow sugar beet and that   the quality  of the  beet produced  and its sugar content compares   favourably with  that produced on  the Continent,  It has also   been established that the cultivation of the crop involves the   employment of a  considerable amount of additional labour on the   land (estimated  at  one extra man  for each  10 acres of beet), th--t   the thorough cultivation  required increases the yield of the  subsequent corn  crop by not  les3  than 10 per cent., and that the   sugar factories  provide a considerable amount of additional   employment during the winter months when work on the land is slack.   Further  trials  are necessary,  however, on the manufacturing side   and it is  for this  purpose that the request is made for a remission   of Excise  during the experimental period.             The request was submitted to the Chancellor of the
nd March,  1922.exchequer on the 21st inst., by a representative Deputation  fromthe Agricultural Committee of the House of Commons,  the british sugar Beet Growers Society, the National Farmers1 Union and representatives of the two existing factories and was supportedby Mr. George Edwards, M.P. and Mr. G.H. Roberts, M.P.  as representing Labour.        The Chancellor made a sympathetic reply to the  requestof the Deputation and it is with his concurrence that I .ask  theCabinet to agree to the removal of the Excise Duty on home produced sugar in the Finance Bill of this year.  The Deputation       Kasked that no Excise should be charged for a period of  five  years,but I recognise that as we cannot bind future Governments orParliament no guarantee can be given on this point.   I  am satisfied, however, that the removal of the Excise by theFinance Bill of this year would,  if approved by Parliament inorder to assist an infant industry, afford sufficient security to those interested in the industry that the Excise  will notbe reimposed during a reasonable  experimental period.        It is a matter of great urgency that a decision on thematter should be given at once and a public announcement made,as the seed must be sown within the next ten days if a  crop  is  tobe produced this year and the sugar factories provided  with  thenecessary raw material for the manufacture of sugar.
