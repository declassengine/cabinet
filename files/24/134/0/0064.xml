(n                         &quot;                                   b                Memorandum  by the Ministor  of Labour.                      Engineering Dispute.SECRETCTK                (Previous Papers CP.5809).3864.            The Sense  of  the House of Commons during  last nightTs       Debate endorsed .the  view I had held  that the appointment of       a Court  of  Inquiry into  the engineering dispute  would he       inopportune at  the moment owing  to the existence  of  the       ballot among the unions  other than the Amalgamated Sngineer-       ing Union on the  question.  The  result of  the  ballot will       be known on. the 25th.   Whatever the result,  that is, whether       the unions  accept  the memorandum of  the  employers or reject       it, I propose immediately upon  the declaration of the       ballot, to write to the employers and to  all the  unions       affected  suggesting to  them  that  in the interests  of their       industry and in view of  the general  anxiety that this       dispute coming at  so unfortunate a time  should be settled,       they should meet  forthwith and  attempt to  arrive at  an       agreement as to their respective positions0                                   (Initialled)   T.J.M.       21st March,1922,
