TPTBSF2.                                                         ^                  SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT, PART II.       *J                           _-._--_--.__--.-------                  \^                 Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.               The Board of Trade have now received seven Reports           signed or decided upon by Committees to whom complaints under           Part II of the Act have been referred, four of these Reports           being in favour of and three adverse to the applicant indus-           tries (see Appendix A).   In the case of the adverse Reports           no question  as to,the action to be taken will of course           arise, but in the case of those which are favourable to           the applicants, it is necessary to decide as a question           of policy whether the Board of Trade are to exercise their           powers  to make Orders under the Act.   The main decision .of           policy  can be dealt with in connexion with the Report on,    ^           Fabric  Gloves and Glove Materials, a copy of which Is           attached  (Appendix B).                This Report is unanimously and unhesitatingly in favour-           of  the  applicants.   Strong opposition has however been ex-           pressed  by  the Lancashire fine  cotton spinning industry  -           an  opposition which is based on  (1) the fact that Saxony  is           an  important market for fine yarns, and (2) what may be           described as general free trade  arguments applicable to many           industries.   It is clear, not only from the evidence which           was given before the Committee  (and which was not strictly           relevant  to  the  Committee1a- terms  of reference), but also           from direct  representations made  to the Board of Trade,  that           there is  a great uneasiness on the part of the  fine  cotton           spinning  industry;  the real substance of  their objection           appears  to be  the fear  that if a  duty  is placed upon German           fabric  gloves  the German manufacturers, who up  to the present
have obtained nearly the whole of their fine  cotton yarnsnot only for glove making but for hosiery generally fromLancashire, will by way of retaliation oease  to  buy fromLancashire and get their supplies from some other source;for example;  from Prance where,  it is stated,  fine cottonyarn of a suitable quality could  quite well be manufactured,although in practice this has never been done.     The issue is really a very simple one.   The fabricglove and glove fabric industries whioh would be affectedby an Order appear never to have  employed more  than about12,000 personss  before the war,  they employed  a littleover 2,500 and the figure has fallen during 1921 from over,000 to under 2,000.   On the other hand the number  ofpersons employed in the fine cotton spinning  industry must be (at a very rough estimate) something  over 70,000.If it can be shown that this much larger Industry is  infact likely to be materially injured as a result of a duty placed on fabric gloves the  balance of advantageis obviously in favour of making no Order; but no direct evidence has been adduoed to show thai the imposition ofa duty on fabric gloves would, in * aot, affect  the exportation of yarn from Lancashire to Germany.    the fear of the cotton spinning interests is based purely onhypothetical considerations, and on general grounds  itseems extremely doubtful whether German manufacturers ofgoods involving the use of fine cotton yarns  would seriously endeavour to transfer their custom  elsewheresimply because His Majesty^ Government in the  ordinaryexercise of their powers under the Safeguarding ofIndustries Aot imposed for a period of a couple of years            1a duty of 33^2 ad valorem on fabric gloves to meet thetemporary difficulties due to exchange.   It  must be                         t-2 .*
pointed out that Germany could not impose retaliatoryduties on British goods without violating the  terms ofthe Treaty of Versailles;  and for many years  to  comethe diplomatic pressure which we can bring to  bear on theGerman Government would be sufficient to make  them restrain,if  necessary, any group of their traders from overt actionprejudicial to British interests.     I have carefully considered the whole position,and, having regard to the unanimous recommendation of   -the Committee and the hypothetical nature of the  objectionsurged against the adoption of that recommendation, I see no other course open but to make an Order as provided inthe Safeguarding of Industries Act.   In view, however,of the politioal aspect of this question I think  it rightto consult my colleagues in the Cabinet before taking any action, and I would ask for a decision at a very earlydate.                              .(Initialled.)

AgjgNBjg Aft     (1)   Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Aotcame into force as from the 19th August, 19S1,  the dateof the Royal Assent,,   In accordance with the provisionsof this  art of the Act, complaints are made to the Board ofTrade regarding dumping (either in the sense of  alee belowforeign cost of production (Section 2 (1) (a))  or deprecia-tion of currency (Section 8 (1) (b)) )t if the  Board of  Tradeare of opinion that a prima facie case hae been made outj,the complaint is referred to a Committee consisting of fivepersons selected by the President from the Permanent Panelconstituted under Section 7 of the Actj the Committee holda public Inquiry, in accordance with the statutory Rules ofProcedure, and report to the President of the Board of Trade.If the Committee report that the necessary conditions whichare specified in Section 3 of the Act are fulfilled, theBoard of Trade may, by Order, apply Part II of the Act to goods of the particular class or description concerned ifmanufactured in the foreign country concerned, the reeultof such application being that such, goods if manufactured in such country are subject to an import duty of 33gj  ad valorem^All Orders are subject  to confirmation by an express resolution of the House of Commons.      (8) A number of complaints have been received and considered by the Board of Trade, and 10 have so far been referred to Committeese   On 7 of these  complaints theCommittees have completed their Investigations, and eithertheir Reports have been received or their inquiries havereached a sufficiently advanced stage to make it possible tosay in what sense they will report.   All these complaints have
been based on the ground of depreciation of  foreign currency(Section 2 (l) (b) ),  and the country of manufacture  isGermany only, (except  in the case of Glassware where  both germany and czecho-Slovakia are covered by the complaint).     (3) Of the 7 Reports so far received or decided  upon,4 are in favour of the applicants and 3 adverse.     Of the 4 favourable ones, the Pabric Gloves  Committeeand the Aluminium Hollow-ware committee report unanimously  infavour of the applicants j the Enamelled Hollow-ware Committee,whose Report has not yet been actually signed, are by a  majority in favour of the applicants, one only of the five members of theCommittee dissenting from the findings of his colleagues.    In  thecase of the Qlaesware Committee, four out of the five members findin favour of the applicants so far as regards Bornestic andIlluminating Glassware, though one member adds a  reservationwith regard to Oil Lamp -Chimneys, and the fifth member  presentsa minority Report unfavourable to the applicants under all  the headings covered by their complaint.     The complaints relating to Plain and Enamelled Baths and toGold Leaf are rejected unanimously by the Committees  to  whom they were referred.  Pour members of the Toys Committee  have signed a Report unfavourable to the applicants,  while the fifthmember disagrees with the findings of his colleagues.
          APPENDIX   BSA?EG-HARDIMG- OP INDUSTRIES AOT,  1921.             REPORT               OP THE         COMMITTEE  Appointed by the  Board of Trada  To aonsider apnlioations of theNational Association of Fabric GloveManufacturers and the Glove and Warp         Makers&apos; Association   tinder Part II of the above Act.
       -&quot;A 1310SlOVgg AND GLOY-j: MATERIALS COMMITTEE REPORT.          ,  ITo the President of the Board of Trade.Sir,                                                                     11.   By minute of the Board of Trade dated shored November,  1921,       we were appointed, undor Part II Of the  Safeguarding of IndustriesAot, 1921, to enquire into a oomplaint by the&apos; National Associationof Fahrio Glove Manufacturers and the Glove and Warp Fabric Makers1Association, that fabric gloves and glove materials for the manu-manufacture of fabric gloves (that is to say, gloves made of woven orknitted material which are out out and sewn up, termed in  thetrade fabric -/loves, ana including lisle, Suede finish, Duplex,  Silk  \and all other gloves madf from cotton or silk fabric), manufactured in Germany, are being sold, or offered for sale, in the UnitedKingdom at prices which by reason of depreciation in the value inrelation to sterling of the German currency are below the  prioesat which similar goods can be profitably manufactured in the UnitedKingdom, and that by reason thereof employment In those industries in the United Kingdom is being or is likely to be seriously affected.    We were directed after ascertaining  the facts to report -          (a) Whether the conditions specified in Section  2,         sub-Seotion (l) of the Safeguarding of Industries Act,         1921, are fulfilled;  (b) on the effect which the im-         position of a duty under Part II of tho Act on goods         of the class or description covered b-:r the complaint         would exart on empl07/ment in any othei industry being         an industry using goods of that class or description         as material;  and (c)  whether in the.opinion of the         Committee production in the industry manufacturing         similar goods in the United Kingdom is being carried         on with,reasonable efficiency and eoonomy.2.   The applications of the two Associations representingrespectively the makers of glove fabric, and tho makers of fabric loves were consolidated for the purpose of our enquiry.   As  certainfirms are makers both of the fabric and  of the gloves it was not         possible to treat the two subjects cuite separately but we endeavour-ed to do so as far as practicable.
                                                    &apos;    25,13* The announcement of the appointment of the  Committee was published in the London Gazette of the 25th November,  andnotice was given that we should sit to take evidence onthe 12th December, 1921.   On 3rd December, the Committee werenotified that the applications would be opposed on behalf  ofChambers of Commerce, Distributing Houses and of certainCotton spinners.4. We took evidence in public at three sittings and heard29 witnesses as follows   On behalf of the Glove Fabric Makers.    T&apos;&quot;&apos;fche Secretary of the&apos;Glove and ivarp Fabric       Makers&apos; Association.      Two manufacturers.      Two Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers.      Secretary, North Devon Glove Manufacturers Association.                          Clove   On behalf of the Fabric/Makers.      The Chairman and Secretary of the National       Association of Fabric Glove Manufacturers.      Eight manufacturers.      One representative of the Workers1 Union.   On behalf of the Opponents of the Application.      ^he President of the Boltoh chamber of       Commerce.      Two Yarn Spinners.      Eight representatives of importers and       wholesale houses.      One dyer.5* Our rules of procedure as prescribed by the Board of  Tradeunder Section 7 (3) of the Act allowed us to hear counsel who                                                                ifwere, however, debarred by the rules from putting questions      tl                                                                 Ito the witnesses.  Otherwise we followed generally the pro-       Ioedure adopted by Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees,examining witnesses on statements submitted by them, every member of the Committee taking part in the examination.   TheCounsel appearing before us were Mr.Barnard Faraday, (instructed  fby Messrs. Moreton Phillips and Sons) for the applicants and major Entwistle, M.P, (instructed by Messrs. Stikeman and company) for the opponents.6. In addition to oral evidence we were supplied confidentiallywith statements of cost of production by several of the  fabricand glove manufacturers who appeared before us and a largenumber of priced samples of fabric and gloves of English andGerman make were submitted to xis for examination by witnesses
 both for the applicants and the opponents.    The statements of oosts were in eaoh case oertified by a Public Aooountant and were examined in the Finance Department of the Board of Trade to whom we are indebted for analysing and commenting upon them.                            GLOVE FABRIC 7.  The quantity of glove fabric made in this oountry before the war was about ten per oent. of the total quantity required to meet the home.&apos;demand for fabric gloves, the remainder being imported mainly from Saxony.   When at the outbreak of war this importation oeased, a strenuous attempt was made to supply the demand and a  number of factories were opened and plant installed. In this enterprise a considerable amount of capital was in- vested.  Delay and dlffioulty neoessarlly arose, owing to war oonditions, but by 1918, the output of fabric in this oountry was six times greater than in 1913, and was practically auf- fioient to meet the requirements of the home market at that. time. 8.  There are now seventeen firms who are members of the Glove and Warp IPabrio Makers&apos; Association, and they are stated to represent approximately 90 per oent. of the total output In this oountry.  Two or three factories have olosed down and some &quot;others have been idle for about 12 months.  In IVlSHiheve were 165 glove fabric machines existing, but not all of them were working oontinuously.  In 1918-19 the number had increased to 250.all working full time and many&quot; of them overtime.   At present not more than 80 are working, and many of these only on part-time. The number of workerB emplqyed in making, dyeing, slieding and finishing fabric were as foilowe                                  .191..     im&amp;2    1980-21    Making..................      160        80O        200    Dyeing, sueding and   \    finishing .,........       50        350        100
      In 1918-19 all  hands wore  employed at  full-time and over- time,  whereas in 1920-21 they wore  employed only on part-time. 9.   From the evidenoo given  and samples submitted, it appears that the selling price of cotton fabric imported from Germany is  from 13$  to  34$ lower, and for silk Milanese fabric from 5f0 to  18$ lower than the British cost  ef production. 10.  It was stated in evidence that  certain  kinds of fabric required by  glove makers had not yet been produced in this country and  further  that the finish and quality of the im- ported fabric were superior.  On the other hand it was stated that English-made fabric is  superior in durability, that the kinds  of fabric  most  in demand were already made in this country and  that any other kinds required could readily be turned out by the existing  machinery.  From the samples of goods submitted for  our inspection we  are unable to see any grounds for the allegation that  those  made in this country are inferior to Gorman-mada  material. 11.  Certain  evidence was submitted with the view of convincing us that the  exportation from the Bolt on district of cotton yam to Germany for tho manufacture of glove fabric would be affeeted prejudicially if a duty were imposed on imported gloves.  We were anxious not  to exclude any evidence which could in any way be regarded  as relevant to our enquiry,  but, on consideration, we think we  should not be justified under the terms of our reference in having regard to this point even if the evidence had  carried  conviction.  By Section 2 (2)  of tho Act we have ta report  on the effect which a duty would exert -on employment in an industry using goods of that class as material l.e.f  glove fabric or fabric gloves.  The spinners of yarn,  as such,  not beingusers of the materials do not,  therefore,  properly come within our purview.
                                              /           &apos;     25fi                     FABRIC GLOVES.&apos;12.&quot;  Glove-making is an old-established industry in thiscountry but before the war there were very few firms producingfabric gloves, and it is estimated that about 90$ of the re,?quirements of the United Kingdom were imported from Germany.&quot;In 1913 no less than 2,511,009 dozen pairs were imported from?.Germany, out of a total importation of 2,531,798 dozen pairs.&quot;During the war the trade developed considerably until 1918,when over 50 firms.,,were engaged in the manufacture of gloves inthe United Kingdom.  In 1920 German., competition began again to be felt and many faotories closed down.  There are now only about20 firms engaged in this trade and most of the factories are on short time.&quot;   The cost of labour on all the processes representsabout 70$ to 75$ of the cost of production of fabric gloves,&quot;  Thereis no doubt that many of the firms who embarked on this industry during*the war turned out gloves of very indifferent quality andfinish.   This was partly due to the fact that all the new workers had to be trained. ...The cost of training alone ran into many thousands of pounds.1  The quality of production, however, steadilyimproved and the output of the majority of firms reached a standard only slightly low*r than that of those who had beenin...business before the war,13?  The number of workers engaged in the manufacture of fabriogloves in this country was as follows                July, 1913 *.........*.**.ytj  2,400                July, 1914 ^^^^  2f672                July, 1918 ^10,832                July, 1919 ^.,,4..,...,,,* 10,948                July, 1920 ***9,860                July^ 1921              3,948                Sept. 1921...........  1,744       The present stagnation of trade with its attendant unem-ployment has no doubt in some measure reduoed the demand, but nevertheless the throwing out of employment of five-sixthsof the workers engaged in an industry is a serious fact, evenalthough the number of individuals affected may be relatively
 small.   It was stated,  moreover,  that  of  the  present  depleted numbers very many were  only employed on part  time,  in this connection it should be noted that  the glove  making industry, particularly in the  West of England omploys a large number of outworkers.  Prom a  statoment furnished by a  representative  of the  Workers1  Union it appears that  in  tho Torrington  district alone the 510 members of the Torrington Branch of this Union have lost in 1981, 59,970 days.      14.  Owing to the fact  that thero  are so  many differont varieties of gloves  produced, we  have  found it extremely difficult to compare the cost  of  German gloves with similar British articles. Prom the  evidence Submitted and the samples received  by us,we  are, however,  satisfiod that the Gorman  goods  are  sold or  offered for  sale  in this country at prices  35$ or more less thaft the cost at which similar goods can at  present be produced in this&apos; oountry.   We are satisfied  also from theevldenoe that offers have been, and are being made,  by agents  for  German makers--anxious to re-establish their trade, at prices much below those nominally quoted,                                        \                             CONCLUSIONS.      15.   The concisions w.e have arrived at  on all the evidence submitted to us are  as  follows      (i)  Vory little ovidonce was submitted to us as  to the  cost of production in Germany, and we  are unable to express an opinion as to whether goods aro being  sold or offered for safe  in the United Kingdom&apos; at prices below the cost  of production as defined by Section 8 of  the Act.      (ii) We are of  opinion that  both  glove fabric  and fabric gloves  of German Manufacture are  now being Bold and offered for  sale in the United  Kingdom at pricos  below those  at which similar goods, at tho present time, can be profitably manufactured in this country and we  are, further, satisfied that this is caused by reason of depreciation in the value in  relation to sterling of tho currency in Germany,  Wo have  boon
                                                      &apos;     258   I                                                                  Ifurnished by tho Statistical Department of the Board ofTrade with statements (Soo Appendix) showing tho current rates of exchange on London in Berlin in 1920 and 1921 andthe internal and external (United Kingdom) purchasing powerof 100 marks.     (iii) Tho fact that employment in the industries with whichwe are concerned has boon very seriously affected is undeniableand we are of opinion that it has been so affocted by reasonof the cause referred to in the procoding paragraph.  Thereis reason to beliove that it is likely to bo still furtheraffected so long as the relation of German currency to sterlingcontinues to be abnormal.  Evidence was submitted to us to theeffoot that the manufacture of fabric gloves in this country13 now being carried on mainly by means of an export tradeto the British Dominions whore Gorman goods aro unable to compete, either booauso, as in Australia, of an embargo uponthoir in troduotion, or, as in Canada, by fiscal arrangementswhioh neutralise the effect of the disturbed exohange.  In theovent of a change in these conditions the present market for english made goods would be greatly restricted and furtherunemployment in the Industry would be created.     (iv) We have received no definite evidence that an impositionof - a duty on imports from Germany of fabric or gloves would affect employment in other industries but thero are certain industries, e.g., button-caking, braid-making, box-making,etc., whioh may be regarded as auxiliary to glove-making andthe output of whioh is affocted by the quantity of glovesmade in this country.     (v) As wo have already indicated there is no doubt that theoutput of many factories established during the war, undercircumstances of groat difficulty in connection with the
instalment of suitable machinery and the employment of efficient labour, was unsatisfactory.    Those firms whichare now engaged in the industry appear to us to be carryingon the manufacture with reasonable efficiency and economy,and in most cases are maintaining a standard of productionequal to that of any foreign competitor.16.

                         GERMAN  CUBHBNCY.               Memorandum b.v Statistloal Be par teas nt.     The figures in the annexed Table are derived  as follows:-   1*  Column It   The official wholesale price index numberie a monthly average of the prices of 38 commodities. 16  ofwhich are produced in Germany and 22 importedj  further,  18are foodstuffs and  20 are industrial good.    These goods areweighted according to their estimated Importance in consumptionfor the period 1908 - 12.   The base is 1913, taken as 100.   2.  Column 2*   The wholesale price index-number compiledby the frankfurter Zeitung is based on the prices  of 77commodities at the beginning of each month and is  not weighted.In the Table the average index-number for any whole month iscomputed by averaging the index-numbers for the beginning ofthat month and the month following.   The base is  1933, taken as 100*   This number has been frequently corrected by itsoompilers and the accuracy of the figures has been repeatedlyattacked by various critics.   3. Columns 3 and 4 show  the internal purchasing power of100 marks in commodities as compared with 1913, the resultmeasures the depreciation of the purchasing power  of the  markfor  internal purchases.   4.  Column 6 shows the exchange^ Berlin on London, thequotations.being the monthly averages of the daily mean ofthe  quotations given in the Times.   6.  Column 6 gives the monthly Board of Trade wholesaleprice index-number, average prices in 1913 being taken asa basis.   6.  Parity of exchange being taken at 20.43 marks w  1,Column 7 shows the number of gold marks which 100  paper marksrepresented at tbs dates in the Table as measured  by theirpurchasing power in sterling,   For example, taking January,                             11.
           I                1     I                    x  y   fill) hi%9%Q, tn iha Garage of that  month 824,858 paper markB were required to purohass  1 sterling whioh 20.43 gold markspurohased before the war, therefore the external purchasingpower in sterling of 100 paper marks in January, 1920, wasonly equivalent to that of 9,09 gold marks before  the  war.This measures tiie--external depredation of the mark in sterling.   7.   Sterling, however, has itself depreciated,  and sofar as its purchasing power in commodities on wholesalemarkets is conoerned, the depreciation is measured by  therise in the wholesale price index-number.   Consequently,to obtain the measure of the  external purchasing power ofthe mark in British commodities, the sterling measure  mustbe divided by the commodity prices index-number.    This is done in Column 8, where, for  example, it is shown  that inJanuary, 1920, 100 paper marks could only purchase as  muchof British commodities on wholesale markets as 3  gold  markscould before the war.   In this way the external depreciation of the mark is measured in terms of commodities,  so far asthe United Kingdom is concerned.   8.   Columns 9 and 10 show the ratios of the Internal and external depreciation of the  mark, according as the OfficialIndex-Number .or that of the Frankfurter Zeitung is taken asthe measure of wholesale price variations within Germany.     In considering the applicability of the ratios of com-parlson which are set out In the Table it must be  borne inmind that all&quot; index-numbers are imperfect and can  only give general indications of the phenomena they are used to  represent.     Further, although the relative internal purchasingpowers of two currencies are  the fundamental factor in deter-mining their exchange value,  other causes, 3uch as speculation,political factors, temporary unusual shortage of bills,  etc.,may at times, seriously deflect the exchange from  the  point at which It would naturally have rested,
