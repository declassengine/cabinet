              With reference to the memorandum (CP.3.863) of the Secretary       of State for the Colonies on this subject, I desire to point out           (1)  that whatever statement may have been made by Lord       Ernie  (then Mr, Prothero) at the Imperial Conference of 1917.  he       subsequently explained the circumstances under which the alleged       pledge had been given, pointing out that he only had in mind a       temporary opening of the ports for- Canadian stores in the event       of certain war contingencies,  which did not .arise, and that after       the Armistice he immediately informed the Canadian authorities       that the policy would not be carried out.   These war contingencies       were (a) that owing to the submarine menace, we might be compelled       to slaughter the greater part  of our flocks and herds in this       country, so that temporarily a new source  of supply of stores       would be necessary;  (b) that  there would be a very large       extension of arable farming in Great Britain and (c) that there       were signs of a serious falling off in the number of stores coming       from Ireland. ..None of these anticipations were realised; and  oh       March  25th, 1920,  Lord Ernie  made the following statement in  the  \       House  of Lords:-                                                   I            &quot;The danger,  as I have said, receded Into the background, and  ,       after&quot; the Armistice Canadian agents saw me in the presence of  the       Parliamentary Under-Secretary  of the Colonies and I told them  that       the circumstances  had changed, that the one overmastering pressure       of necessity had gone, and that I saw no reason why I should be       a party to altering our policy of the exclusion of Canadian cattle.,       I saw them on two  subsequent occasions.  I told them the same  thing&apos;:       I also met a very  important deputation representing all parts  of       the country on the  question of the admission of Canadian store       cattle.  They asked for it, and they contained a very important       representation from Scotland.   I gave them the same answer.  If$ .     told them that the circumstances had so completely changed that       there  was no reason to reverse our policy, and before I left the       Board in June, 1919, I issued a notice in the Press to the effect       that the Board of Agriculture  did rot intend to reverse the       policy&quot;.                                                         -   (THIS DOCUMENT  IB THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT) .bSCRET.lC                           C A B I N E T . ,P. 5900,                                                          ^                         CANADIAN CATTLE EMBARGO.                  K                  Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture.
   Shortly before this, on November 12th, 1919, Lord Lee of Parehara   who was then President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,   stated in the House of Lords:-        &quot;Altogether, in view of the changed circumstances      since the qualified undertaking was given by the      Government in 1917, we are not prepared to introduce      legislation to alter the existing law.&quot;   It is perfectly clear, therefore, that whatever may have been said   at the Imperial Conference in 1917, the responsible Department   of the Government plainly stated in 1919 that the undertaking   given under completely different circumstances could not be   carried out and that steps were taken to inform the Canadian   Government.        (S) I do not agree that our present action hes no regard   to &quot;the scientific merits cf the question as determined by the   impartial Commission&quot;.  The great weight of the scientific   evidence given at  the Enquiry was against removing the embargo -   Sir Daniel Hall, Sir Stewart Stockman, Professor Wallace of   Edinburgh and Lord Ernie himself all gave evidence in this   sense.  The Commission&apos;s Report, moreover/ is defective ih the   following points:*        (a) It deliberately limited its reference to the case of   Canada, though the policy cannot be so limited.  At the meeting   of the Imperial Conference In 1921 referred, to by the Colonial   Secretary, MV, Htfi&amp;hes entered this caveat        &quot;l do hot want to take up your time, but now that Mr.      Meighen has brought this matter up I am  sure you are aware      of the position of the Australian exporter,  I only want to       call your attention to the disabilities under which he is      labouring now.&quot;        (b) It left entirely out of account the risk in war which   we should run if we became dependent on our overseas    sources of supply for stores on the ground  that this wasv   outside the ,terms of reference.        (c) It based Its opinion of the effect of the removal of    the embargo en meat prices on a miscalculation,  stating that
20Q /GO stores coming from Canada,  which was the  number  theCarfedians suggested they could send, would represent &amp;f. of thesupply of meat in this country, when the actual figure is only 2\%.In other.respects, I can only regard the report of the RoyalCommission as a very inconclusive document; but even if it were held theft we were bound to &quot;act upon if&quot; literally, I would point cut that on page 11 of the report, the Commission say that^what .the^far:.numerous^ think mayJbe^ja reason for some delay in takingaj3tfpn if Year Ma y gtyjs Government Jbhinkg tbat this is desira.b&apos;1e ,&quot;S^ursly we can ,;act upon&quot; the report In this sense.     (3) I do not agree with the Secretary of State for theColonies that the recent Cabinet decision was wrongly andinadequately recorded.  But I stated on the occasion when thatdecision was reached that in the event of a Private Member&apos;bill or motion being introduced,  I should not personallyobject to the question being left Cpen so far as members ofthe Government were concerned, and that Government Whipsshould not be put on.  This is a very &quot;different matter from introducing a Government hill.  1 understood, however, thatthe Cabinet decided otherwise.  I am quite prepared now toagree to this solution, if the Secretary of State for theColonies presses  for it provided always that I am permittedfully to state the strong objections felt by my department and myself to the proposal.A.
