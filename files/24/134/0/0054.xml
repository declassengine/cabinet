The offioial instructions issued by the NationalAdministrative Council of Unemployed regarding the engineeringcrisis are given in an Appendix to this report.  Tho majorityof the engineers is nevertheless orderly at present.     Tho addition of the lockad-out engineers will more tharoounter-balance this year1a decrease in the unemployed figures.     Agitators1 speeohes aro becoming more violent.     Information is given regarding the plans of certain&quot;intellectual&quot; Communists to capture the Policy Conference thisweok-end.     Details are given of the transmission of money from moscow to Great Britain last month:  minor officials in jjheRussian Trading Delegation are involved,     MacManua returned from Russia on Tuosdtiy;  the CommunistParty was oagerly awaiting the money which he was expected tohave been promised, or to have reoeivsd, in Moscow.
i     267TH5 UNEMPLOYED          On March 6th the wholly unemployed on the live registers     numbered approximately 1,811,543, as compared  with     1,837,233 on February 28th,  the decrease being about 25,690     for one week or 123,000 in the last 8 weeks.   The  total     decrease will,  unfortunately,  be more than wiped out by the     lock-out of members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union.          Speeohes at unemployed meetings show, in  some cases,  a     tendency towards incitement but have in the main dealt with     the engineering dispute, the principal points  being that     the   employed must co-operate with the employed in &quot;the     fight against capital&quot;, must not blackleg and  must help to     picket.          During the week a feature of unemployed activity in     the Metropolitan area has been a species of route  marches:     on March 11th,  for instance, a contingent of Southwark     unemployed marched to Cambcrwell where they were Joined by     a local group:  they proceeded  to Rotherhitbe How Koad where     they were joined by contingents from Greenwich and Deptford ;     a deputation then visited a  firm of general millers whose     employees were  on strike and subsequently marched  to their     respective districts.  On March 13th a 8&amp;ttersea contingent     was accompanied by six -ion carrying sandwich boards with the     inscription &quot;Pay no Rent&quot;,          On March 14th Shack, a  He^ington Communist,  said at     Tottenham that  he had borne to  wake up the local organisation:     he wanted a full muster for  a  demonstration on the following     day and if 5,000 went to the Guardians&quot;  offices &quot;prepared  to     wring the damned necks  of the  Guardians&quot; it would  &quot;ginger  them     up  a bit.&quot;  Re  added,  &quot;If the  bosses win the engineers1job     will not  be worth the unemployment dole.   So what  is the use     of  working?  If the struggle is carried on  the only                                              1   alternative/
alternative  is  for the  workers  to  take /possession  of  the factories.   They are yours, you built them.   I have beentelling you  this for a  long time.   This  is Bolshevism,  It isalso Socialism.&quot;     On March 13th eight  members of the  Lambeth  organisedunemployed took possession  of an unoccupied  house  at  33,Winslade Road,  3uxton,  They were  arrested as suspected personsbut released on their identity  being established:  two of thesemen were found  in an empty  house with other  members of theLambeth organised unemployed on ; arch 8th.     Luring  the (few days  preceding the engineering look-outthere were signs of improvement in the unemployment situationin Lancashire and Cheshire, although my  correspondent reportsthat the miners are &quot;seething with discontent&quot; and the offioielsare having all  their work cut out  to hold the men  in check.      Luring the week the Legislative Council of the  UnitedTextile Factory Workers&apos;  Association considered  a  circularfrom the Minister of Labour and decided  to recommend  theCotton Trade Unions to  accept the  proposals  of insurance byindustries.  Bolton operative spinners have  discussed thismatter and in their annual  report.it is  stated that under a contracting  out scheme  the  cotton  trade  would be in a positionto show the  other organised industries of the country that theprinciple of each industry providing adequate remuneration for its own unemployed  workers  when periods  of depressionovertake  the industry  was practicable.     Unemployed meetings  continue  to be  held but the  Communistsdo not appear to be making much headway.  In.Liverpool theUnemployed Distress Committee (a bona  fide  organisation) hascommenced the issue of  food coupons, samples of which have beensent by WiIfred Braddock  to the man.in oharge of the  secret Jrevolutionary press with  the request that two or three thousand                                                    bogus/
- a -268 bogus  cards  be printed:   the  Chief  Constable of Liverpool has been  informed.     Last week a number  of unemployed marched from Barrow to  Ulverston Town Hall to protest against the wages paid for relief work:  members of the  Rural  Council were imprisoned in  the hall,  some of the windows of whioh were smashed.  The Police v/ere  summoned and dispersed  the crowd which numbered several hundred:  J. C.  Armstrong of Balton  was subsequently bound  over for twelve months  on the charge of assaulting a policeman.     On March 14th a number of Stookport unemployed marched to  the union  offices at  Shaw  Heath and after the Guardians had declined  to receive  a deputation endeavoured to rush thepolice, who had to use their  truncheons:  there were further disturbances  in the evening,  a plate glass window at a shopbelonging to  one of the  Guardians being broken and a police sergeant  being struck on the  head with a stave.     The  Salford Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee, which is affiliated to the national Administrative Council ofUnemployed, has issued the first number of a paper called &quot;Reveill^&quot;, part of which is  devoted to an article &quot;To theSlops&quot;, which is apparently Intended to undermine the discipline of the Police.       It  is reported that the Newcastle unemployed intend tojoin forces with Gateshead and demonstrate in the latter citywhere  they consider the Police have not numbers sufficientto  cope with largo crowds: adequate police arrangements have,however,, been made for &quot;this &apos; eventuality.   The Chief Constableof  Gateshead informs me that a number of Newcastle men werepresent when the Gateshead unemployed marched in processionto  the Guardians on March 7th:  on this occasion W.  J. Cogsn,referring to the recent disturbance at Newcastle,  said,          &quot;It is bound to come in Gateshead,  and if we&apos;are    . only as well  organised and prepared  as  the Police they     will have to  look to their laurels - we are numerically     superior to  them ar.&apos;.:i what is more we are desperate  men. &quot;                                                 The/
The  Secretary, A. Fullerton,  said at  the  same meeting thathe had been present in Newcastle and.           &quot;If  I had had a revolver  I  should certainly have     used  it,  especially when a baton  just missed my head,&quot;     Tho Chief Constable of Coventry  informs me that frequentmeetings of the unemployed are being held but there appearsto be a good deal of dissension regarding the rulings of theCommittee  Chairman, Tom Dingley.  the  adoption of RobertWilliams as Labour candidate has caused a split as some of theunemployed now decline to support Leckie.  Discontent among tbeLeicester  unemployed is said to be  increasing, although themajority is holding aloof from the  unemployed committee, one member of  which has deoamped with funds amounting to  8,leaving his wife and children dependent on the Guardians,  TheChief Constable of Birmingham states that numerous meetingshave been  held in his area:  the speakers have dealt largely  .with the engineers&apos; look-out.     The Chief Constable of Southampton informs me that on March11th about 100 unemployed from Woolston rushed the Mount PleasantSchools at which the Trades and Labour Council was meeting: no damage was done but the Council, had to abandon the meeting: thecause of the trouble was the failure of the Woolston unemployedto secure  stronger representation on the  unemployment oommittees.The Chief  Constable adds that the. Southampton unemployed,  whonumber about 10,000 are on the whole very orderly.     The Chief Constable of Plymouth informs me that Ebury has left that city, having announced his intention of proceeding viaBristol to South Wales where he, intended  to carry on propagandaamong the miners.   Sbury also told an audience of about 700 onMarch 12th that the engineers&apos; lock-out provided en excellentopportunity for overthrowing the capitalist class and seizingthe workshops:  they must be prepared to use force, to attain their^ends.;,                 . j      ..&apos;            ., -:. &apos;                 *     The Chief&apos; Constablo of&apos; Portsmouth informs me that the                                                  -  unemployed/

C. Lucy, secretary of the Exeter Communist Party, actj.ng under the instructions of Maldwyn Evans,  secretary of the South Wales and West of England Division of the unemployed, is endeavouring to organise the local unemployed;  he has received the following advice from Evans:           &quot;Endeavour to get as many CP.  members as possible      on the Unemployed Committee.  Mass meetings of the      unemployed should be arranged often, always appointing      a speaker who will put the communist point of view.  The.      speaker should not be advertised as a Communist of      course.&quot;      The Bhondda No. 1 district miners&apos;  council has passed a resolution calling upon the Government to take over the whole of\ the mining royalties and apply them for the benefit of the unemployed.      On March 7th a large mass meeting of Upper Rhondda unemployed at Ton Pentre passed a resolution strongly protesting against the action of the Government in curtailing the unemployment dole.      It is reported that the unemployed  in the West of Scotland intend to demonstrate more frequently,  partly in order to show their sympathy with the engineers.  The  prospect of decreased unemployment benefit has resulted in more numerous visits to Parish Councils.   The intervention of the Scottish Board of Health in regard to  the scales of relief paid by the Falkirk Parish Council has deprived the Scottish unemployed of  an argument as useful as was Poplar in England.      The Chief Constable of Greenock sends me the following account of unemployed  activities in his  area:)v          &quot;On February 9th,  1922,  the  unemployed &quot;held up&apos;  the9     Parish Council  Offices here and the  following men were      reported by me  to the Procurator  Fiscal, County Buildings,      for mobbing and rioting or alternatively with committing      a breach of the peace.

Thomas King, Labourer,  1,  Smith&apos;s Lone,  Greenock.                 William MoClafferty, Riveter, 34, Arthur Street,Greenoc           The trial took place at the Sneriff Court  on 2nd March, 1922,           and the Sheriff&quot;found  Murphy, McDei.d, McGuire  and Ross guilty           of mobbing and rioting as libelled  and sent them to prison fen           3 months hard labour.  The charge  against  King end McClafferti           was found not proven.  On Sunday 5th  March a &apos;Protest Meeting&quot;1           was held in vacant ground, at  the east end  of  the Esplanade one           a resolution was passed for tho release of these men  and           forwarded to the Horns Office, Scottish Office, M.Ps., etc.           The Committee then made application to  the Magistrates to have           a 1 Protest Demonstration and  procession&apos; through the town on           Saturday, 11th March, and this the  Magistrates refused.  The           Committee on Sunday, 12th March&apos;, held a meeting in the ground           at the east end of the Esplanade and there passed a resolution           of protest against the Magistrates for not allowing the           process ion.&quot;THE REVOLUTIONARY ASPECT OP THE ENGINEERING DISPUTE         The national look-out of members of  the Amalgamated Engineering    Union began on Maroh 11th: the dispute has not as yet spread to the    other engineering unions though some of these are likely to be    automatically affected in a very short time.  Members of the    Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades  federation, tho National    Federation of General Workers, and the National. Union of Foundry    Workers are meanwhile balloting upon the terms rejected by the    Amalgamated Engineering; Union, the papers being returnable on March    23rd.  The National Joint Council has requested Government inter-    vention under the Industrial Courts Act. . Yesterday the delegates    of the shipbuilding unions rejected  the employers1 amended offer.         Although there have been isolated oases such as at Grimsby,    where the men have continued working as the points at issue do not    touch them,  and  others in which the men have let their union, the    national  outlook is grave,  and attempts have been made to  aggravate    feeling by the publication in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and &quot;The  Communist&quot;    of an alleged secret circular issued by the employers.         The  efforts of agitators are directed to the widening of the!)    dispute,  to  stiffening  resiftance to compromise,  picketing and                                                      insistence/
 insistence on the  alleged identity of interest between employed and unemployed.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is doing its utmost to fan the  flame  of  discontent and Walton Newbould has written for tn? current&quot;issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; an article on &quot;The Crisis in the Shipbuilding Industry&quot;, which follows the lines  of his  South&apos;Wales miners&apos;&quot; article: Communists have been urged  to spread this article broadcast, but more particularly among Clyde-side and Tyneside Workers. A special, edition  of &quot;All Power&quot;; the organ of the Red International of-Labour Unions&apos; (which is working in connection with: the Communist&apos;Party)  is to  be issued&apos;to-day and E.  Lismer has asked lewbould to write an article on the engineering dispute.      In London the Communists&apos; claim to have control of the strike committees  and to  be content with the posit ion.  In Edmonton tin platers and&apos; general  workers&apos; numbering about  350 have struck in sympathy with the  &quot;engineers and at Beckenham members of the Amalgamated  Engineering Union have threatened to bring out. non-union men  who are still working.      The Unemployed in London and the &quot;provinces have been exhorted by their  speakers  to stand by the engineers and to assist in mass  picketing and there seems little doubt that these-instructions will be carried but by members ofNthex national organisation.      In Sheffield  J.  T. Murphy, George Pletoher and C. T. Woodhead are taking an active part in the engineering dispute and have prevailed upon a Section of the unemployed to picket/Steel-works and  try to persuade other workers to strike :   they have not so - far  been&apos; successful,  but have started&quot; to issue, a &quot;Lock-out Bulletin&quot;.   Sean  MacLoughlin is in Leeds and on March 13th delivered an  inflammatory speech in which he advocated the  confiscation of factories.     On  March  9th  a conference of unemployed  organisations                                                     in/
 in the Midlands was held at Smethwick and pledged itself to support  the  engineers.    My Midlands correspondent reports that  he has found very few members of  the Amalgamated Engineering Union  who  even saw a ballot paper:   these men  do not attend branch meetings  and consequently  did not receive voting papers.    Communists are very active in this area.    It is reported that  in Nottingham  many workers in small firms have  signed agreements  to work on  the  employers&apos;  terms and there is a  risk that these  men  will be  intimidated.   Harry King, the Communist Amalgamated  Engineering Union  official, has told  my correspondent  that  he  has received instruction^ from 16,  King Street,  to send  gangs of engineers  to factories where men  are  working  and fetch  them out.  My correspondent adds that  the locked-out engineers  are not getting much  sympathy  from other workers.     On Maroh 12th it  was  stated at  an aggregate  meeting  \ of  Coventry branches of  the Amalgamated Engineering Union that the  Union  had about  250,000 for  lock-out pay and that the  Co-operative  Wholesale  Society had  offered  to honour  food vouchers.  On  Maroh 13th  there were many applications  at Coventry factories  for the ,1obs vacated by  members  of the  Amalgamated Engineering  Union but the  extremists  appear  to be alive to this possibility:Rannington, Leokie,  Dingley, Heard and Shillito (who organised the 1  Castleford gang1 during the miners&apos; strike last year) were all preBent at  an unemployedmeeting on Maroh 12th:   the question of prosecuting thefirst named is under consideration.  He said in regard to demonstrations  to factories that demonstrators ought:                                           &quot;Not/
     &quot;Not only to picket and demonstrateoutside tne Factory Gates, but if thereare blacklegs inside go inside and fetchthem out ... Of course I am not goingto tell you how to get in, but when youget into e Factory each hatch will have its. own job.  There is the telephonebox, a hatch takes charge of that to stop communication with the outer world.There is a batch for the Managers Office,others look after the Exit doors toprevent the office boy or the tea boyfrom slipping out and calling in. the manin blue, and so on, every batch to itsown job.  This can be done and it hasbeen done, not once, not twice buta dozen times in the little town I comefrom (London) and other places.  Butthey do not publish these things in the newspapers.  You see if they did other people might try it on, and they are not anxious that you should.&quot;     He appealed to his hearers to sacrifice&quot;all even to life if necessary. &quot;     On Tyneside extremists are also active:,William Gallacher has visited Mtincheeter.

     During the week the attention of the communists haa  &apos;heen divided between the engineering orisis, the policyconference and the Russian Famine Fund:  the first is dealtwith in another part of this report.     Branches in London and the provinces have discussed the Theses and appear, for the most part, likely to pass the relevant resolutions at the conference on March 18th - \\Interesting information has come into my possession regarding^what appears to be a plan of the better educated and moreable Communists to oapture the machinery of the CommunistParty and convert it to extreme revolutionary uses.  Thedecision to admit proxy delegates has played into the handsof this group, which includes Page Arnot (secretary of thelabour Research Department), William Hellor, (industrialeditor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;), W.M. Holmes, (&quot;Daily Herald&quot;staff), E.P. Dutt, (editor of the &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;),A.L. Bacharach, (University Socialist Federation), MaryMoorhouse,  (Red International of Labour Unions), andFrancis Meynell (former editor of &quot;The Communist&quot;).  this group has drawn up the following terms of reference fora commission to be appointed by the conference;          &quot;That a Commission of nine members, elected by     this conference, be appointed to review the     organisation of the Party in the light of the Theses,     and to make detailed recommendations to the Executive     and to the Annual Conference for the application of     the Theses.  In particular it shall be the function of     the Commission:-     1.      &quot;To draft such revisions of the Constitution          as may seem necessary to bring it into accord          with the Theses,     2.      &quot;To examine and report on the existing          divisions, areas and other units. *     3.      &quot;To draw up a full scheme for the co-ordinatioj          and direction of groups and nuclei in the trade )          unions and other working class organisations    )          and to make recommendations as to the first steps          to be taken in the practical operation of this          scheme.THE COMMHMIoTS

Theses in those respects.     &quot;The Commission shall be empowered to call for reports from any and every section of the Party organisationand shall have access, to all necessary documents for thepurpose of conducting its enquiries&apos;;  but shall have no executive powers.   Power to co-opt more than three membersis given to the Commission.     &quot;The Commission shall issue a first report not morethan one month after the date of its appointment andshall present a complete report to the Annual Conference.Wherever alviaable or possible the Executive shall putinto operation interim recommendations without delay.&quot;     The sub-executive committee of the Communist Party lastweek accepted these terms of reference with the singlealteration that they themselves are to be the commission andthe members of the group have accordingly set to work to getthomselves appointed proxy delegates,  hoping in thisway to persuade tho conference to elect them as the commission.     0.

Others can only gone proxy     delsc&apos;*tes,  I do not know whether you are representing     Exeter at, the conference. ; I very much hope you are.  But     if not it would oe very good if you could nominate one of     the West Central Comrades as a proxy; delegate.  He would     pay the whole delegate ;fee and would give you a good     report of the conference,&quot; &apos; A similar letter has been sent to thw Lancashire organiser and as the engineers&quot; stoppage has led to the abandonment of the &quot;charabano trip&quot; which was to bring, these delegates to London he thinks that he he can &quot;get  proxy credentials for                                                     the/
the whole list provided that they flan find their own 30s.&quot;Another plank in the platform of this group is the allegedinaccuracy of the English translation of the Theses and PageArnot has accordingly asked Philips Price to send him theGerman edition.     Interesting information has been received regarding thedispatch of Russian money to this country:  Jack or JohnnieWalker, the representative of the Third International inGreat Britain, to whom reference ha3 been made in previous reports, appears still to he in this country and thefollowing extracts are taken from a letter signed by the&quot;Deputy Director of the Department of the World-wideSocialist International of Communist Germ Cells&quot; dated february 8th, 1922, which was addressed to him, but wasseized in transit by the Libau police;          &quot;Regarding money the position is the following:     As soor. ae we received your first letter complaining     about the want of means and also that Peter had none   ;  we iamsalate^y sent you  200 for expenses and 300     pounds sterling for The Labour Research Department     with the letter of January 12th,          &quot;After this., on receipt of your monthly statement     we sent you a further  .200 by the letter of February     2nd.   Both.,-;t.he. ;e sums&apos;we did not send by March route     No;. 1 ar.d 2 bub by the very safest way in an official     character in the! name of Comrade 3,&quot;     The inference from this letter is that Peter Miller, theoypher clerk of the Russian Trading Delegation, and Berzin,Krassinls second-in-command., are fully cognisant of and accessories to the transmission of Russian money for propaganda in this country.  The fact that money has beensent to the Labour Research Department is particularlyinteresting as publicity work of the Department came underthe control of the Joint Council last, year, although the research work is still carried on independently.  It is of                                                    course/ s
course probable that some part at least of the  30 &apos;  has  beendevoted to the &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;,  which is  published  belowoost price and is in many re pects Bolshevik propaganda.     It is reported that&quot;Arthur Field has  offered to introducean Indian in London to the representative  of the  ThirdInternational and to the chief official of the CommunistP^rty:  the underlying idea is apparently  to instruct theIndian as to methods of propagating Communism^ in  India.     Edgar ..hitehu3c.u has lost no time in using the ideashe gained in America for the benefit of the Russian  FamineFund and Fred Beet has embodied these in a circular  tobranches:  &quot;Hunger Banquets&quot; are su^iested at which  eachGuest would have an exact ration as issued in the faminearea of &quot;ci small piece of black bread and  a tiny  piece ofsalted herring on a thin skewer.&quot;    It is further proposedthat the name of each contributor to the fund should be entered in a &quot;Roll C..11&quot; book, which would be sent to theSoviet archives in j,foscow as a record of solidarity.  the circular adds that relief work has &quot;.he highest politicaland material value.&quot;     There are increasing indications that unless ArthurMacManus, who reached London on Tuesday, has been wellsupplied with funds, tho financial position of the CommunistParty v/ill be difficult:  this week the divisional organisershave been informed that, except in cases of particularhardship, thoir salaries will be reduced- from  6  to  5per week and the latter amount only was sent, although thetotal for Glasgow was  28,     The revolutionary press in Glasgov: is also in                                            difficulties/

Well     I learn that they are again considering another     reduction in wages, this week,  and I feel like giving     the b..... task up.   Not so much because of  the  wages     but because of the general hopelessness of  our whole     posit ion.          &quot;We would require about  150  at least for a     National Conference.  Now that  we have.been denied     having  a delegate, over thero,  we stand no  chance now     of over getting the necessary assistance towards  having   -  that conference...          &quot;Enclosed you will find a  very useful  circular hut     no b..... stamps.&quot;and        &apos; &quot;I will carry on as long as possible but the     policy  conference of the Party  will decide  as to  what     and how long they can pay -any staff.

When you get up at 5 or 6     o1 clock on a cold and fogx$y morning, when the hooter     blows, you would rather stay at home in front of the     fire in a nice cosy chair, or stay in bed a little     longer.  Yet you cannot.  Why?  Because you are afraid.     What arc you afraid of?  The sack at the week-end; or,     perhaps, you get a quarter or a half day docked.  You     know what that means;  the scheming and soraplng to     make ends meet,          &quot;Have you ever aeked yourselves why you are afraid?     Yet you do the work, for it is you workers who make     everything.  You are afraid because there are a few who     own the means of life, the things you work with:  and,     owning these things  they own your life while you are     working for them.          &quot;If you want to understand your position in     society, join the Young Communist League.

discipline.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY IH THE UNITED KINGDOM        At the Executive meeting of the Irish Sel -Determination   League  at  Leeds  on the 5th March,  after much angry discussion,   the  following resolution was. recommended for adoption at  the   annual  conference  of Branohes to he held in London on the   1st  April:             &quot;That  the delegates assembled at this annual        conference  of the Branches  re-affirm the object of        the League  as passed unanimously at the annual        conference  of Branches held in Manchester on November        22nd,  1920, and which read  as follows:             &quot;To band together the  Irish residents of Great        Britain in  order that they  shall as a body support        their compatriots in Ireland and use every means in        their power to support the  application of tlio principle        of Self-Determination  for  Ireland and the recognition        of the Irish  Republic proclaimed in Dublin at Easter        191S  end confirmed by the representatives of the people        of Ireland  at the first meeting of the Do.il E^resnn;the        Parliament  of Ireland,, in January 1919; and further, In        the ms&amp;nwhile, to render all and every assistance to any        Irish subject in prison in  Groat Britain, and to do  all f        other acts  which will further tho cause of the Independe!        Irish Republic.&quot;        It was mainly owing to the  efforts of the London   contingent that  this resolution  was passed and tho President   of the  Committee,  Mr.. J. MacManus, resigned as a protest   against its adoption,  after strongly urging that the. Irish   who  llva in this country should  not interfere with affairs ii   Ireland.        It is  a noteworthy fact that the membership of the Iris:-.   Self-Detsrmination Loague throughout England and. Wales has   fallen  vory considerably during  the past 12 months. .  In  the!   beginning  of 1921, the membership wag fcnown to be close on   27,000  and at the  present time It  is reliably estimated to H   only 18,000.   The decrease appears to have been general   throughout  the. country and.it may be confidently anticipate)!   that further reductions in membership :will take place and im

Be Talera^ supporters in Irish Republican Brotherhood  and irish Republican Army clroles in this country continue to showactivity, particularly in Scotland.    At  an Irish RepublicanBrotherhood meeting held at Bridgeton, Glasgow, on the 5thMarch it was decided that seleoted members  of the Irish Republic?Army should be invited to join the Irish  Republican Brotherhoodso that they might counteract the influence  of  the &quot;FreoStaters&quot; who are said to be &quot;perverting&quot;  the younger men ofthe Irish Republican Army.   The &quot;Free Staters&quot; are apparentlyalive to the activities of the Republicans  in Scotland,  forSean McGarry, who is an old Irish Republican Brotherhood man,a member of the Ball Eireann and also a member of the DublinCorporation is touring Scotland in support  of the Treaty.     Roderick Connolly, the President of the Irish CommunistParty and editor of the &quot;Workers&apos; Republic&quot;, is finding itdifficult to make both ends meet in Dublin  and it appears thathis colleagues in this country are sceptical of tho movementin Ireland, with the exception of Sylvia Pankhurst, who is always an optimist for any extreme revolutionary  group.     Two members of the Royal Air Force absconded this week with 24 Colt automatic pistols which they stole from the RoyalAir Force Cadet College at Cranwell.   Enquiries  tend to showthat it was their intention to dispose of these pistols toRepublicans in Ireland.

The following resolution should     be submitted:          That this Mass Meeting of Unemployed Workers          of ( ------) demands that the engineers and all          other sections of organised Labour shall resist          the employers1 demands for overtime.   We          strongly condemn any compromise as a vital          blow against the millions of unemployed and their          families,  Further, we call upon the whole of          the organised Labour movement to form a united          front with us against overtime, against          reductions in wages, against the lengthening of          the working  day or week,  and guarantee that we of          the Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee movement          will do our utmost to assist organised Labour          to resist the attacks of the employing class,     (2)  All Unemployed organisations should get into     immediate touch with the Lock-out Committees of the     A.B.U, and, if possible, seoure the ao-option of     the A.E.U. members of the Unemployed organisation     on the Look-out Committees.

(4)  Have all raiding parties  in order and prepared     to take immediate action.     (5)  In conjunction with the Lock-out Committees,     arrange for mass  meetings of engineers and unemployed&quot;     workers during the day,  and mass meetings for all     workers at night.
(6)  In view  of the possible  extension of the conflict until it embraces  ever  larger numbers ofworkers, hasten on the  formation of  Joint councils of employe? and unemjO-oycd  workers,  and make themefficient  organs cf. ?,ct;iono            ;                1(7)   All  Committees  should get  into action lmmeaiateljand are asked to iorv/ard  regular reports of activities,      On behalf of the National  Administrative Council,         -  ;  Wc Hanndngton      Nat.
