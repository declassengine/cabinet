SECRET.                    CABINET.CP. 3890.                 Trade Prospects.Memorandum by the President of the Board of  Trade.                                                                     11.      I submit the following report In compliance with the   request of the Cabinet at the meeting on March 8th,        I have seen a number of leading business  men  in the   principal Industries as well as the ablest managers of the big   banks and I have studied all the relevant memoranda prepared   In my own department and in that of Overseas Trade,2..      I anticipate a alight expansion in business as a who let   possibly continuous and in some directions more marked in the Autumn.   but I do not believe that it will be of such dimensions as to reduce1   unemployment to any  considerable extent during the present year.        To look farther ahead is hazardous, but I oan see nothing   to warrant us in looking for much better conditions next   year:   the most I hope for is a slowly improving trade*                      -3,      It is  true that the world needs goods, and certainly   in normal times that need would soon be translated Into demands   But there Is a new factor which disturbs the equation and   that is the poverty of the consumer.        It remains to be seen to what extent people will do   without goods in themselves desirable and content- themselves   with purchasing absolute neoessitiea.   If this purchase   of things In themselves desirable be still deferred, there   will only be a flicker here and there,  a demand from this   oountry or that for this or that class of goods, and the   flame will burn low again for want of fuel to  feed it.4.      The situation might be altered by a still further fall   in prices,  brought about as a result of lower  waggs and a   reduction In railway rates.   It is not possible to say positive-   ly that a substantial demand would spring up immediately but   one illustration feroes itself on my notice.        After much tribulation,  the Coal Trade is once more on   an economic basis and the export trade has revived to an   extent that no one engaged in it could have dreamed of a few   months ago*        It may be that a similar reward awaits the next great trade   that makes an ecjial sacrifice to face the realities of tho   position.IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC &quot;\          J           MAJESW&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.
        Until there  ia  a  closer relation between the wages of   skilled and unskilled  men in and about the pits, and the   wages of skilled  and unskilled men in other trades, I fear   that the volume of business will shew but little improve-   ment.   Of course a  steady rise in world gold prioes, whioh   is anticipated in some quarters, would be a great factor   in our favour.5.      Our Export Market is necessary to our existences  no   other country in  the world is in this position.   We need   It because we are over-industrialised.   Now while it is   true to say that  Europe  is not our chief market for manu-   factured goods, Europe is essential to us to help in   providing  oredits with  whioh oourftries overseas oan purchase   our manufactured  goods,6.      The vast and complicated machine of international trade   and credit has grown up  almost unperceived through three   generations.   It had  become so beautifully adjusted in   all its parts, there was such absence of friction in its   working, that few were aware of its existenoe,        The war- threw it  out of gear,   For three years we have   been trying to start the machine:   with difficulty the cog   wheels are being  fitted  and  Borne are revolving, but in   Europe the damage is almost Irreparable, and the whole refuses   to function because  a  part will not work,        I am convinced  that there will be little progress in   Europe until the  question of  Reparations is out of the way,   and reductions are effected in the expenditure of the various   countries comparable to  those vie are proposing in England,   By   that means alone  can the purchasing power of the nations be   inoreasede   until ^wope can purchase freely,: the conditions   are wanting in which a lasting improvement of trade is   possible,7,      I have purposely  avoided discussing markets in detail   lest we should not  see the wood for  tha trees but I cannot   refrain from alluding  to the political, unrest in India and   In a less degree  in  China whioh is  causing traders the gravest   anxiety,8,      There is one point  upon which  1 have myself considerable   apprehension and  I  think it Is worth investigation.   Having   regard to our increasing population and the ever Increasing   productive power  of  modern machinery and methods I feel that   we have reached the  point or perhaps have even passed it   where we are able to find continudus employment under satis-   factory conditions  for our people.   My fear is that we may   find even after an  expansion of trade that we  shall have  with   us a pool of unemployed  who will quickly degenerate into   unemployable and  become  a perpetual danger to  the  social and   political life of the  country,   A  great effort should be   made to move our  surplus labour into the dominions to relieve   conditions at home  and to increase  our most valuable markets.   Of the political  importance  to Australasia, of  a large   population 1 need say  no tiling.25/3/22.      (Initialled)    S.B.(2)
