    PART  II.GENERAL INTELLIGENOE.SOWALILAND.         Since the murder of the Politioal Officer at Buraoinsubordination has occurred, in the Somaliland Oamel Corps,one company of which, it is stated, were unwilling to fire onbodies of riflemen implicated in the Politioal Officer&apos;smurder.         Two aeroplanes have been sont from Aden and theGovernor of Somaliland has asked G*0,Co, Aden, to hold, one british Indian Company ready to embark.                        RUSSIA^    SiberiaC-   A report from German sources states that thenegotiations between  Japan and the Republic of the Far Eastat  Dairen (Dalny) have come to an end without result.The Republic insists  on the evacuation of North Saghalienby  Japan and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from vladivostock.         Reports from Chita state that^the troops of theRepublic of the Far East are approaching Dormidonov on therailway to Vladivostok, and that the army of the MaritimeProvince Republic is  thoroughly demoralised.  A retreat asfar as 1&apos;man at least  appears certain.         The Prime Minister, M. Ponikewski, handed in the resignation of the Cabinet, as they did not wish to urge the diet to oppose the wishes of the Vilna diet to be annexedby Poland.                         ITALY.         The ex-Khedive of Egvut is at Messina, apparentlywaiting an opportunity of proceeding to Egypt.  The ItalianGovernment have been requested, to frustrate any such attempt.         Fighting was reported as being taking place in Flumeon 3rd March, and it is stated that an armed drifter wasseized by some Fascisti from Trieste who steamed round to thefront of the town and opened fire against the GovernmentPalace, some 30 rounds being fired in all.  The Palace was hit once, and also several private houses.  The drifterwas pursued by some Italian warships., but was not cautured.         On boinp: informed of the Greek Government&apos;determination to seize as contraband the carrjo of&quot;Espoir11, tho French Minister at Athens stated, that all greek ships in French &quot;ports would be dot rnned by way of retaliation.
The Greek Government decided to innore the throat, but later,on receipt of a telenrron from M. Gomiaris pointing out thatthe supply of munitions of w fron Prance might be jeopardised, offered to buy the &quot;Esnoir&quot; cargo.  This offer was refused.         At present it is unknown whether Prance intonds tocarry out her threatened action against Greek shipping.  Thelatest information to hand is that the &quot;FspoirB has clearedfrom. Piraeus after discharging her cargo.         The situation in Crete is still unsatisfactory, asover 1,000 irregulars are still at large under the leadership of an ex-captain named Gyparis.  The Minister of the Interiorwho went to Crete to investigate the situation stated on his return to Athens that the trouble vras entirely due to theVenezelists, who were unceasingly assuring the &quot;copulationthat M. Venezelos would soon return to Greece.                     TURKEY.         Izzet Pasha, the Constantinople Minister forForeign Affairs is believed to have left Constantinople on 4th March by Orient Express for London,  He will thereforearrive before Yussuf Kemal, who is proceeding via ?lars exilesby sea.  There is good reason to believe that he does not seeeye to eye with Yussuf Kemal.         Whilst at Constantinople, Yussuf Kenal had a secretinterview with the Sultan, but it is Understood that hiswelcome was hardly a warm one.   There is no doubt that the sultan is still bitterly offended with Mustapha Kemal onaccount of the latter&apos;s threat to oust him from theCaliphate.         Various reports state that the Greeks are contemplatinganother offensive against the Nationalists, and, incorroboration of this theory it is pointed out that theMilitary authorities are requisitioning coal and produce of all descriptions.  It is considered possible, however,that General Papoulos, the Greek G.O.C. in 0. (who isbelieved to be at tho head of the Die-hards, who willrefuse to evacuate Anatolia) is taking steps to providehimself with the sinews of war in the event of no further supplies being forthcoming from Greece,         Apparently some of the Greek soldiery have beengetting out of hand, for a report from Smyrna (sinceconfirmed)  states that on 15th February a oosse of soldiersand armed civilians attacked Karat if e - a village near Kaushbetween Aidin and Nazilli, and, after imprisoning the Moslemnopulation in the local Mosune, set fire to tho village,with the result that 150 Moslems were burnt to death.
