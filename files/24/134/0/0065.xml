In acoordaj&amp;ae with the  recent  decision  of the          Cabinet we have carefully considered  the  question of          Unemployment  Insurance, and  submit  the  following          Report -          S.   Our proposals arc made  on  the  assumption that the          steady, if slow, improvement  of the   unemployment posi-          tion is continued, that for  G-reat Britain the  unemploy-          ment figure will average  about  l,900t000  up  to midsummer          next, and that for the ensuing  12 months  there may be an          average number unemployed of  about  1,500,000c   While it          is extremely  difficult to forecast  the  probable trend          of employment during the  next 18 months,  it  is, of course,          possible that the situation may be  alleviated  by  a revival          of trade, while, on the other hand, it  may get much worse If&apos;          the dispute in the Engineering  Trade  is prolonged,  or          if other  important industrial  crises arise.   The  financial          aspects of such deterioration are indicated  In paragraph          &apos;0 below,iOl TO BE   3.     We are impressed by the  argument that it is desirableBED 31  -[OSED       on both political and  financial grounds that the proposedISLATIOB.legislation (which must inevitably make special provisions to meet the exceptional unemployment situation in the nearfuture) should cover a period extending well into 1923,We accordingly recommend           That the proposed legislation should           cover a period ending on 30th, June, 1923,
PERIODS.4.   As from 5th April ne&amp;t large and increasing numberswill e3l\auso their remaining benefits under  tnc twoUnemployment Insurance Acts of 1921 and will, if no special provision is  ratio ? be ineligible for furtherbenefits until the new period of benefit opens on 3rdJuly 1922 45.   After careful consideration of the question of  thesituation to whioh  this will give rise we make the            following recommendations:-Summer&apos;           (l)   That within the period 6th April -Period                November, 1922, there should bo a * Skaterof                    period of benefit&quot; of 15 weeks in ail to beBenefit *               given  (in the es.ee of uncovenanied benefit)                      in three periods separated in each case by                      intervals to be suggested by tho Minister of                      Labour after consultation with the Minister                      of Health, dre regard being had to the needs                      of  the early autumn months*(2)WinterPeriodof Benefit.(3)(4)fa  .)  that persons who have exhausted allcsnsfits on Wednesday 5th April, shall  &apos;again become entitled to benefit as from monday, 17th April,  Three days benefit will be paid to them on Friday, 21st April,(b)  Similarlyj persons who exhaust theirbenefits after 5th April, shall  suffer a break of    weeks before  again becomingentitled to uncovenanted benefit.(o)  All benefit whether covenanted or un-eovenanted drawn after  5th April shallcount against the  maximum permissibleperiod of  15 weeks.That within the period 3rd November, 1922, to30th June, 1983. there should be a &quot;winterperiod of benefit&quot; of 16  weeks plus, atthe discretion of the  Minister of Labour,a further period not  exceeding 6 weeks or22 weeks in all.-That  while it is probably impracticable to insist on intervals within the first 16 weeksbenefit  in (3) above, the Minister ofLabour should take power in the Bill toimpose an interval between the 16 weeks andthe,further period not exceeding 6 weeks.That the Minister of Labour should also take power to secure that the special eon-ditions and restrictions now in force (seeAppendix) are strictly applied to the benefitperiods  of 15, 16 and 6  weeks specifiedin (l)  and (3). so far as relates to un-covenanted benefit.
\3STHIBDTX0HS,     6.&quot;   Iho rats of Stst^ oonisricu-fcion has sinoe                the -3^50 ai3t:^i3vls:i.- o  the confidential^ploymsat^Xne-amiioe---&quot;                Scheme in 1920 boon ono fifth,   When tho separate                Unemployed Workers&apos;  Dependants&apos;  Scheme was intro-                duood last Autumn with a separate  fund and separate                contributions the State contribution to that                temporary measure 7vras put at three-sevenths in the                csase  of mea and one-half in tho  case of women.                During the period of the scheme  we now recommend ,                the funds and contributions will be merged and  the                Chancellor of the Exchequer has  expressed great                anxiety le3t,  as  a result,  the State contribution                should be permanently loft  as a  proportion exceeding                one-fifth.    Our  proposal with regard  to  contribution-                tions  requires that  the  contributions from employers                and employed should  oontinue unchanged,  and in  view                of  this we  do  not think  that we  can recommend any                reduction in the  State  contribution.    It  should                be  clearly understood, however,  that this  applies                only to  the  period up  to  July 1923  and   the Minister                of  labour  in  introducing  the Bill  should make it  clear                that this  is.  so  and  that   tho intention is to res-                tore the  State contribution to the proportion of                one-fifth, as from that  date    Subject to this, we               accordingly recommendt                            That  the existing combined contributions                            for benefits and grants  should remain                           unaltered^                           The contributions are -*                                              Men       Women                              Employer        10d.        3d0                              Employes         9d.        7d0                              State           &amp;fd.       5 d,                                            2TIfanra a7
 74      In view  of tho heavy debt which has accrued  on  the Unempi .yinont  if\ind: it is essential that the  expenditure of  the  jftuid should now bo brought into closer relation with the contribution receipts, and to secure this  there is  no alternative to a reduction in the rates cf  benefit payable *   The  present rates are:                Men         15/- a week                Women       IB/- a weok with grants of  5/- for a wife and l/-  for each child under tho Unemployed V/or ker3T Dependants  (Temporary Provision) Aot*   This Act, however, empires on 9th May, 1923.  After  careful consideration we think  (1) that so long as special contributions at. the present rate are required, any reduction ox -oho benefits for wives and children would bo open to misinterpretation, and  (2) that any possible  reaction ox these dependants: grants- (ace C0Po3721) on  National Health Inarrance can be mot inter all by the argument that the grants in question are an exceptional arrangement designed to alleviate an altogether abnormal  unemployment situations Bo   It is possible that when the proposed Bill is  before tho House of  Commons, a demand may be put- forward for tho continuance of the present rates of benefit inclusive of the dependants&apos;  granta0   Ho are advised that such a concession would involve  adding to tho outstanding debt- owing to the S chequer by tho tfund a cum of  9,COG:COO..making tho total indebtedness of tho Jhznd to tho Ib-cohcqiiei&apos; on tho 1st April 1923,  28,500-000 as against an estimated 19,500,000 on tho basis of tho reduced rates of benefitrecommended below0  It would bo quite out of the question to finance any such proposals      We recommend -         (l)   That the proposed legislation should              provide for weekly ratos of benefit              of 17/- for married men s plus if- for              each child;  3.2/- for a sin0le man and              10/- for a single woman,

If  afrger number of weeks is given tho  figure of outstanding debt at that  *9p;lH be increased.              -5&quot;
    12,    It should, also bo observed that tho continuance    o.&apos;- ths State proportion, of tho contributions to tho    Unemployed Workers1 Dependants Euad amounting to a sum of    about  5, 0O0., 000 a year is a direct additional burden on the    Exchequer,,    13*    In addition the Exchequer would hare to advance such    further amounts beyond the provision of  19 ,000,-000 made undo    the existing schemes as may bo nciessary to enable the pro-    posed benefits to bo paid,    1      In the  circumstances, as it appears essential to avoid    the nood for further legislation later in the year, vie can    see no alternative to an extension of the pi-osont maximum    borrowing powers of tho Ministry of labour by  5,000,000    although,  as will be soon from the figures given above, wo ar    advised that no more than half a million of this sum is    certain to be  required or. if the situation in the Engineerir.    and Shipbuilding trades dovolopes unfavourably, 2 millions          Wo recommend -&apos;             That  tho proposed legislation should authorise             tho Treasury to make an advance for the purpose             of discharging tho liabilities of the Unemploy-             ment  -Fund up to an b mount not exceeding  5,000,000             in addition to the  19,000,000 covered by             existing Statutory powers.3A-15.   The cost of administering the Unemployment Insurance   Fund up to 10&apos;,u  of the income is charged to the Fund,  Any   excess over 10;5 is charged to tho Exchequer,,  The cost has   in each year exceeded 10,3 by varying but always substantial  ,   amounts, and the scheme recommended by us will undoubtedly   have ths effect of increasing the cost of- administrations   In these circumstances we recommend -             That  the appropriation in aid of             administration expenses should bo-             increased from 10/o of the total             contributions to 12g$ thereofo
