I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the appended letter fromMr. Michael Collins regarding the state of affairs in Northern Ireland.                                                  (Initialled)      W. S. C.    Colonial Office, March 24, 1922.      COPY OF A LETTER  FROM MR.  MICHAEL COLLINS TO  MR. CHURCHILL.                                Oifig an Uachtarian, Holla Na Cathrach,Dear Mr. Churchill,                      Baile Atha CUath, March 21, 1922.    I must draw your very urgent attention  to the latest utterances of Sir james craig.  On Tuesday the 14th inst., he delivered a most reprehensible speech in  the belfast Parliament  which has created feelings of the -gravest alarm and uneasinessnot only amongst Catholics of the Six Counties, but generally amongst the people ofall Ireland.    His proposals for bestowing  extraordinary powers on civil authorities for  the alleged purpose of restoring civilised government in Belfast amount to nothing morethan the extension of the means for persecuting and tyrannising over the Nationalistelements within his area with the weapon of torture added.    Craig&apos;s proposed Bill not only vests the enormous powers of the &quot;Restoration of order in  Ireland Act&quot; in the Belfast Minister of Home Affairs, but expressly  giveshim wide power of delegation, and, most ominous of all. further powers &quot; through the amended schedule Regulations, to revoke or add to them.&quot;  This means that virtuallyunlimited powers of a highly coercive nature will be reposed in one man, Sir DawsonBates, notorious for  his antipathy to our people.    Furthermore, the brutal practice of flogging is to be legalised; and I am informedthat this  degrading work is to be done by &quot; Specials&quot; who will be paid at the rateof 2s.  Qd.  per flogging.  The Police who are to  carry out these plans are  all&quot; Specials&quot; who are, as you know, all violent Orangemen and  responsible individuallyfor many crimes.  To ensure further the purely sectarian working of the^Bill,  those&quot; Specials &quot; are to be directed by Sir Henry Wilson, an avowed Orange partisan.    In his  speech Craig declared:          &quot;Southern Ireland desires to coerce Ulster citizens and stir up strife here    by bombing our  citizens and sniping at them and carrying on their warfare to    the best of their ability.&quot;    This is a deliberate falsehood and uttered to excuse the obviously intended fiercerpersecution of Nationalists.  Later he again  deliberately endeavours to put blame for the Belfast orgies on wrong shoulders.   Referring to Sir Henry Wilson he says :          &quot; If anyone in the world  is able to devise something to meet these hordes of    I.R.A., these promoters of Rebellion  .... that man is the gallant Ulsterman,    Sir Henry Wilson.&quot;    The  rest  of the  speech is swarming with similar infamous  suggestions andinflammatory appeals.      [8121]
    He is, however, confuted by his own  colleague, Londonderry, who, the same day, in the Belfast Senate said, as reported by the &quot; Northern Whig&quot; :          &quot; In this connection the stamping out of the  outrage  and crime their    task would be a comparatively easy one if the trouble proceeded from the one    quarter alone; but he regretted to say that that was by no means the,case.  The    fact that a section  of those who saw eye to eye with  them on the political    situation as it existed at  the moment were implicated in outrages which  were    as reprehensible as those committed by Sinn Fein, placed the Government in a    wellnigh impossible  position in their negotiations with British Ministers ....    and the knowledge  of the circumstances had not  been lost  on the British    Government or on the rest of Ireland or on the Colonies.&quot;    He goes on to refer to suggestive speeches made in the Six Counties to the effectthat as the Northern Government was impotent the mob had better take the law into their own hands.  Continuing, he said :          &quot; He had noticed that  as a corollary  to  speeches of that description it    might, of course, be only  a  coincidence, and he sincerely hoped that  it was     crimes had been immediately perpetrated in Belfast.&quot;    And yet,  after  this  frank confession  of  definitely  Orange handiwork in the belfast crimes, Craig proposes to place unlimited authority for the alleged &quot; restora-of order  &quot;  into definitely Orange hands!    This barbarous proposal is only possible to carry out with the  active help andco-operation of ample British  troops which you have promised them, and those willbe used even more so than hitherto for purely sectarian purposes.   I can only pointout to  you  that should this Bill pass it will be the beginning of endless trouble notonly in the Six Counties,  but throughout all Ireland where popular patience with the belfast Parliament is on  the point of exhaustion.    On the 15th instant,  Sir Daw son Bates  declared in the Belfast Parliament:          &quot; The Imperial Government must realise that we are  at war with the    I.R.A.,&quot;ana further stated that  when he came into power he deliberately ordered &quot; theirConstabulary to refuse to continue the liaison arrangements  with the I.R.A., or torecognise that force  in any sense.&quot;   He also said :          &quot; When continued demands for the release of the Sinn Fein prisoners were    refused the I.R A. enforced in the City of Beifast the very same policy that they    enforced in the South of Ireland.  The policy  directed towards making govern-    rnent of the North impossible was a campaign of murder against anyone who    refused to bow the knee to Sinn Fein.&quot;  &apos; Needless to say, this  is a complete fabrication, but its ominous significancecannot be passed by lightly, coming as it does from a man who  is responsible for&quot; law  and order &quot; in the Six Counties.  You will notice that he has deliberatelyordered his police to refuse to carry out the liaison arrangements provided for in the truce, ancLnow declares war against the I.R.A.    Statements such as these  of highly-placed individuals are exceedingly  provoca-tive, and are bound to create swiftly a most terrible situation.  Already  they arebearing fruit.  Since their utterance there  has been a great renewal of outrage andmurder in many parts of Belfast.     On the 16th instant,  there was much shooting and bombing. A bomb was throwninto Seaforde Street, a Catholic area, from Newtownards Road, a Protestant area,wounding badly seven Catholic young men, one of whom was taken to hospital in adying  state.  On this day also  Patrick Rooney. barber, was murdered in Ship Street,and a  little girl of five years, Mary Wilson, of Norfolk Street, was murdered on herfather*s doorstep whilst nursing  her doll. A villanous attempt was made to massacrelittle Catholic children by throwing a bomb into the playground of St. Matthew&apos;sCatholic School, Ballymagarret, which was only frustrated by the timely changingof the play-hour.     Bombing and  shooting and general turmoil continued  on  the 18th instant.Augustine Orange, a member of  a well-known Catholic family, was murdered on his way home  from a Catholic dance in St. Mary&apos;s Hall, because  he refused to curse  the pope.   The same day a  hideous atrocity was perpetrated.  A bomb was flung into
the bedroom of two elderly Catholic women, Rose McGreevy and Mary Mullen, 32,Thompson Street, resulting in the frightful mutilation of both.  I am informed that&quot;Specials&quot;  refused to allow an ambulance to be  called to bring these ladies to hospital.    Orange gang attacked 3, 5, and 7, Empress Street, all houses owned by Catholics.In No.  5 they deliberately murdered a woman named Canon,  aged 75 years, and wounded a youngster named Togue, aged 10.    There  seems to be no  end  to this pogrom on our people,  and the  recent warpreparations  of  the Belfast authorities such as the blowing up of bridges  and thetrenching of  roads must only intensify the feeling  and make  matters a thousandtimes worse.    I must point out to you that the situation in the Six Counties could not begraver.  If these offensive,  not protective, measures  are taken against our people itwill fan a flame of indignation and passion amongst the people of the whole  country,and I cannot be  responsible for the awful consequences that must ensue.    As  it is, it is impossible for me to let this new and undisguised offensive against our people  pass unnoticed,  and  am reluctantly compelled to take immediate counselregarding the reimposition  of the boycott and other protective measures.    Once again I wish to remind you, before it is too late, that I am most anxious forharmony with Belfast, but you will agree,  I am sure, it is utterly out of the question under these circumstances.                                   Yours very faithfully,                                        (Signed)      MICHAEL COLLINS.    When  replying,  will you please say if there is any objection on your part topublishing  this.The Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P.,        Colonial Office.
