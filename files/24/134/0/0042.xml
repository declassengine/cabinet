                       P A B  I  S B  C            Permanent^ Court jof  International  Justice.               Hote  by the Minister  of Labour,jQEEffi.i-P.a84 .        I  oiroulate for information copy  of  a note  by        the  Solioitor to the  Ministry of  Labour indicating  the        steps  that have been  ta&amp;en, with  the  concurrence  of the        Attorney-General, to  ensure that  the  Interests  of this        oountry in relation to  the  permanent  Court  of International        Justice are duly safeguarded.(Iatld.)   S..T.M.Ministry of Labour,14th March, 1922.
                  few        After a number of oonsultations with the  Attorney-general on matters arising out of the Treaty of Versailles,  Part  xni,and the probable effeot of judgments or advisory  opinions of thepermanent Court of International Justioo in labour oases, I wentover to Holland for the opening of the Court,  accompanied byMr. Allen of the International Labour Branch of the Ministry ofLabour.   The Attorney-General attached great  impoytanoe  tokeeping in oloes touoh with the proceedings of the Court, as Inhis opinion, His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably have to intervene in several of the labour oases whiok are expeoted toooma before the Court shortly.         Che judges and suoh deputy judg&amp;3 as  were present forthe opening had resolved themselves into a Kulea  Committee andwere oonsidering, it is understood, draft rules of procedure whiohhad been prepared as a basis of discussion by  the Legal Uireotoratoof the Secretariat of the League.  I was informed that Dr.JoostVan Hamel, the Legal Direotor of the League,  and  Dae, Villalonga,the Legal Adviser of the International Labour  Offloe, Were inunoffioial attendanoe upon the Rules Committee.         A3 a result of the various disousslons whioh took plaoeduring my visit, I hope and believe that the Interests ofGreat Britain will be found to be safeguarded  adequately  V7henthe procedure of the Court Is finally determined, and that aright of audienoe may be granted to all States, if desired, Inoases submitted to the Court for advisory opinions,  as well as  inoases whioh come before the Court on a dispute which has  arisen between state.          Che position of the International Labour Office underArt.26 of the Statutes of the Court was still  obscure when I left the Hague.   From a conversation whioh Mr. Allen and I had withdraw. Villalonga it appears that there is a tendenoy in some quartersto regard that Article as giving the International Labour Oifioe  aright of audienoe in all labour oases.with the same kind  of status
is that possessed by a State  that  is  a Member  of  the League.his would seem to ae undesirable,  though  it night  bo well  that,ben &quot;relevant information&quot;  is supplied  by the International,abour Offioe to the Court,  some  offioial  of the  International,sbour Ofxioe should be in attendanoe to explain  or amplify that^formation if desired to do  so by the Court or by  one  of thetetes interested in the case.  Che  memorandum which His.Majesty&apos;slovemment has recently submitted  to  the Governing  Body as  to thoatter&apos;8 oontroiling the communications  passing between the Officead the Court will serve to direot the attention  of otherlovernments to this important matter.      the situation,&apos; in my opinion,  will  require oareful attentioniu&apos;1 I have endeavoured to establish lines  of communication  so thate may leern at the earliest  possible moment what cases are likelyo come before the Permanent  Court of International Justice and soibtain a decision on the question  of  whether Eis  Majesty^overmen t should      (a) intervene in oases arising on a dispute  between            two States;      (b) ask to be heard in oases submitted  for en advisory            opinion.(SgdJ   GUVS MWREIOL.             6/3/22.
