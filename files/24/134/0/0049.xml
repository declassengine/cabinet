The prospects of immediate trade revival still appear remote.  Although some slight improvement  has  been recorded  in various  industries, the lock-out in  theengineering trades makes the position most uncertain.    In coal-mining  employment is slightly improved.  The slight improvement inthe steel and iron industry has been maintained.  In shipbuilding and engineering,so far as new work  is concerned,  there  has been no development.   Ship-repairing,however, remains fairly active in most centres.    In the cotton industry the slight improvement recorded last week has becomerather more marked.  In.the woollen industry the number of employees reabsorbedcontinues to increase.  There has been a slight improvement in lace manufacture atNottingham. Employment in the hosiery trade remains good.    In general  engineering  the position is entirely overshadowed by the lock-out.The building industry shows a slight improvement due  to seasonal causes.  Theimprovement in the  pottery and china industry has been maintained.  The positionin glass manufacture appears to be slightly worse.   There has been some improve-ment in the wholesale clothing trade in  certain areas.                                       T. J.

[From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee,    The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof  the  Cabinet,  when the Cabinet  Unemployment  Committee  was  appointed  toconsider the whole question and  devise means for relieving unemployment.    [This  Committee has since been in constant session and  has, up to the. 10thMarch, 1922, held 42 meetings.    The problem of unemployment in one form or another  has also been before theCabinet on 58 occasions between the  13th August, 1920, .and the 10th March, 1922.]                       (A.)  Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope wras passed into law on the9th August,  1920, and came  into operation on the 8th November following.  TheAct applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons  ascompared  with 4,000,000 previously.   Subsequent  amending Acts  modified theconditions as regards rates of benefit and the amount thereof which could be drawn.Contributions were  also increased and  authority given to  borrow monev from theTreasury up to  20,000,000.Table showing amount paid out  in  Unemployment  Benefit and the contributions             during the period November 8, 1920, to March 6, 1922.        Unemployment benefit paid        Contributions from              Employers             Employed persons        ...

                  (B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.    A full statement of the measures taken in  the autumn of 1920 and of the latermeasures from autumn 1921 onwards  has been  set  out in previous issues of thisReport.  At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes  at  various times, and at the present time over 136,000 men are employed, exclusive of the workjrovided for men in ancillary occupations and  the effect of the Export Credits andTrade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).    On the 25th  February,  the Ministry of  Agriculture and Fisheries issued  a circular Letter  to  all County  Councils  (except  the  London  County  Council)authorising an  extension of the land drainage  scheme to include  works  for thejrovision and improvement of  water supply to farms.   Schemes, towards the costif which the Ministry are prepared to make a grant of 50 per cent., may be submittedjy farm owners through the County Agricultural Committee up to the 31st March, 922,  but they must be such  as may reasonablv be expected to be completed by the31st May,  1922.SUMMARY  SHOWING  THE LABOUR  EMPLOYED AT  MARCH 3,  1922,      ON  CERTAIN OF THE  SCHEMES  REFERRED  TO  ABOVE.Scheme.I Number limploye.d) in Greater London.Number Employed  in Provinces.Total.1.
