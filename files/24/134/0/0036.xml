             C A&quot;B I. N E T.PROVISIONAL GOVE.RRMLi;T 01&apos; IRELAND COMMITTEE.   I oirculate this Memorandum (P.G.I.57) to tho cabinet at the request of the Provisional Government of IrelandCommittee (P.G.I. 16th Conclusion para. 5)                      PoKELLA&apos;A7:Y .                   .14 March 1922.PROPOSED&apos;&apos;DIVERSION -FROM IRELAND OF CABLE RECENTLYACQUIRED FROM DIRECT UNITED STATES CABLE COMPANY.      (Memorandum by the General Pos-t Office).    This, Cable, which runs from Ballinskelligs  (Co,Kerry)to.;Newfoundland and then to Halifax, Nova Scotia,  wasbought from the Direct United States Cable Company inNovember.1920 for  570,000.   The purchase included aboutSCO miles of. stock cable, valued at  125,000, leaving 445,000 as ,tho value of the cable in situ.....  . ... The objeot of the purchase was (!) to provide analternative to.the Government owned Imperial  cable, which runs from Penzance via the A-ZOree to Halifax, so  as toensure, the continuance of tho service in the  event cf an interruption of the latter Cable,  (2) to supply an additional-channel,  for, the traffic when the full working capacity  ofthe.Imperial Cable ie exceeded.     On  acquiring the D.U.S.Cable, arrangements were made,as a temporary measure, to lease it&apos; to  the Western Union                                            Telegraph                                      *&quot;.P&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CF HIS BRITANNIC          ^              MAJESTY 1S GOVERNMENT)
Telegraph Company, subject to three months&apos; notice, at arental of  56,375 a year, en condition that whenever thoImperial Cable is interrupted the D.U.S.Gable should boused.to carry the Imperial traffic.   That traffic is increasing, and it will soon be necessary and profitable to terminate the lease     The D.U.S.Cable service has hitherto been worked intwo sections,  viz., (l) by a telegraph line between Londonand Ballinskelligs; and (2) by cable worked direct betweenBallinokolliga and Halifax,   The Imperial Cable is workeddireot between London and Halifax, passing through anautomatio relay at Penzance: and in order to admit of thetwo oabloo being working together in the most economicalmanner, it is proposed to cut the D-U.St Cable offBallinskelligs and extend  it to Penzance.  It would then bepossible to work the two cables side by side in London andHalifax and at the Penzance relay station.  If the Cable Isto be used as an adjunct to the Imperial Cable, for whichit was. originally purchased, it would be essential that theconnecting land lines should be under the control of theBritish Post Office and that the Cables should be workedside by side.   It has always been the intention, quite apartfrom.the Irish political situation, to remove the Cable from ireland before the Post Office took over its working.      Against the&apos; cost of the cable extension (about  120,000)there would be a saying in respect of the maintenance and working of the Ballinskelligs station (about-  10,000 atear) and the cost of the landline across&apos;Ireland.      If the service were still working  through Ireland, theIrish Free State would be entitled, in strictness, to.charge                                                        a
