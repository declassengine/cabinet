[This Document  is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET. CP. 3876&apos;.(Printed for the Cabinet.    March 1922.)                                                            3    I  circulate, at the request of the Secretary of State  for War, the following telegrams which were  exchanged  between himself and the  Government  of India,between the 13th and 20th March 1922.                                                                         PEKL.    23rd March 1922.                From Viceroy, Finance Department, 13th March 1922.     Budget.  We anticipate that a proposal may be brought  forward by representa-tives of business interests to suspend temporarily provision of Indian Paper CurrencyAct,  which requires utilisation of interest  on  securities held  in Paper  CurrencyReserve, for reduction of created securities.     2. This proposal  is  one  whicli we should  have been most reluctant, to  initiateourselves,  but  its  presentation  Jion-ofheially  will  make it  somewhat  less  open to objection.   The question of  the  wisdom  of  enforcing this  provisiou in   presentconditions has come prominently to the front in  the last few weeks, and has  attracted&apos;widespread v public  comment in view  of  stringency  of  money which has followedincrease in our  Treasury Bill rates and raising  of the imperial Bank  rate  to 8 percent., which is rightly in large attributed, to  result  of Governments finance,  of whiclithis statutory provision is an important item.   We  have also received representations from  Chamber  of  Commerce, Bombay, to. the  same effect.   Managing Governors ofthe Imperial Bank  also have  urged that the  remainder of statutory cancellation thisyear should be postponed, if possible, to after 31st March.   Bank  has  taken on the 10th March loan of Rs. 2,00,00,000, against internal bills.      3. As you are  aware, we  have  been watching monetary position with considerable- anxiety.  Recent high  rates for money have led to feeling  of  general  uneasiness in Bombay, which is  not without  danger, and  has accentuated difficulty of (sac) which must, in any case, result from liquidation  of cotton piece-goods&apos; position.  Therefor from  the  point of  view of hanking  and commercial interests,  we feel  temporary suspension of this  provisiou, regrettable  as it may  be,  considered on grounds of principle,  would have beneficial result.      4. We do not, of course, fail to recognise objections to such suspension, some of which were indicated  in  your telegram elated 17th February, and  though we  do not consider,  in view  of  present  strength of  our metallic reserve,  that  these, created securities   constitute  immediate danger,  we  realise   importance  of  their  ultimate reduction  to a lower figure.      5. Suggestion made in your telegram that we  should effect  reductions of created securities  from capital, although it would help our  revenue position, would  be  of no practical assistance in our  general resource  operation,  and  if any  modification of law is to be made we  should  prefer  simply to suspend the operation of  this  provision until such time as  our revenue  position will  enable reduction to be carried  out in  a real and  not  in  an illusory manner,  cancellations at  present being, as you realise, effected merely by an addition to our temporary debts.      6.  We desire  your orders,  therefore, whether we may accept the proposal for the temporary suspension of this provision of Indian Paper Currency  Act, if it  is moved in the Legislature  when  Finance Bill  comes under consideration.   The motion might take form of suspension  of provision with  effect  from  current year,  in which, case- cancellation  of notes already made  would  he  taken  against our  other   existing liabilities  for  cancellation,  namely,  154 lakhs of rupees  on  the excess  of Gold Standard  Reserve  over 40,000,0001., and 123 lakhs of rupees as exchange adjustment on the remittances made to you through Paper Currency Reserve in November last.      7.  As you are aware,  we shall, in any  case, have  to cancel currency notes to the maximum extent which the money position  will admit  in course of next year, in order       5276    100  3.22                              .                          A
to effect our remittances to you through&apos; the reserves, so that suspension of provisions in the Indian Paper  Currency Act would make  no difference in the long run to theamount of currency deflation  which we shall have to undertake, but it would enable us to continue remittances through reserves, and  thus delay sale  of Treasury Billslonger than would be  possible otherwise.     S. An even more important, consideration is that if we  have discretion  to accept this proposal  it may be ol:  great assistance to us in  arriving  at settlement with Legis-lature in the discussion on proposals for additional taxation, by giving us something which  we can concede in place of items of taxation which may be challenged.   Wewould request reply by clear line telegram.                          To Viceroy, 16th March  1922.     1156.  Your telegram dated  13th  March.   Budget.   1 share your reluctance to suspend provisions  of section 1.3 (3) of the Paper Currency  Act, but in view of  yourgreat difficulties I authorise you if necessary to accept proposal for  its temporary suspension as from the current year.   I would suggest, however, that it is desirablethat legislation undertaken should specify fixed period for the suspension.  If thiscourse is adopted  there maybe some  advantage in  fixing  31st  March. 192-1 as thelimit of term  of suspension.  If suspension terminated  on 3.1st March 1923  it is mostprobable that you would  be forced to extend the  term further, and repetition  ofsuspending legislation  might be more  likely to  weaken your  position in  two years&apos;time than suspension  for the whole period outright in the first instance.     2. I note the  observations  in last  paragraph of  your  telegram.  If  foregoingexpedient is adopted mainly as a concession on  the taxation  question I trust you willbe  able  to arrange that  it  shall  secure the object you have  in view, namely,  theacceptance of the great bulk of your taxation proposals.               From Viceroy, Finance Department, loth March 1922..     Please refer  to  correspondence ending  with Mr.  Montagirs telegram,  1032, SthMarch.   Retrenchment Committee. Matter has become one of prime  importance, inview of the attitude shown by non-official opinion in this country, both European and indian,  after publication  of  the Budget, as to the imperative  necessity of  reducingpresent scale  of expenditure.   We desire to emphasise again strength and unanimityof this attitude.   As  we have remarked before, it is as  firmly expressed by Europeanas by Indian  opinion.  It seems  likely, indeed,  that  Legislature,  which  in general discussion  on Budget expressed  itself as much dissatisfied with our efforts  to reduce expenditure, may force  matter to  an  issue  by refusing extra  taxation necessary tocover the deficit, or may cause difficulties in another way by making&apos; large  summaryreductions in demands  for supplies under discussion this week,   it has already madecommencement by summarily reducing our first two demands for grants, though both these refer to remunerative departments, namely, Customs and Income Tax.   We regard it therefore of great importance that there should  be  no doubt in  public mind as to;our readiness to co-operate with  public in securing all possible economy and. retrench-ment.   We are further impressed  with  the view  that our own position in the matterwill become insupportable unless we can convince  all  interests here that the scale ofexpenditure of our different  departments has been examined by an authoritativecommittee.   We would remind  you that we have peculiar difficulties in face  ofProvinces, many of which have been obliged  to undertake retrenchment, and who are able to argue that while  we still take their  contributions from them, we have yet.taken no effective steps either to  reduce expenditure or  to justify its scope  by reference&apos;;&apos;to any authority capable of giving an independent opinion.     2. As regards personnel, we agree with view expressed by Mr. MontagiPs telegram.as  to desirability of  entrusting  the work to men  of  experience in affairs, and notselected  on merely political considerations.   For Chairman we should much like tohave a member of the Geddes Committee, and suggest the  name of Guy   Granet, ifavailable,  ft is  essential, however, that, if Chairman  be  obtained  from  home, his name  should command wide authority in  India, otherwise it will be necessary tohave an Indian  as Chairman.  We shall, be glad  if you. will let us know as early aspossible whether Granet. could come out, and,  if so, when and. on what  terms..  Weimagine that the  work would take two, or at outside three months, and could be done.at Simla.  Committee could take up minor questions pending arrival of Chairman.
     3. We propose that remaining  members of the Committee  should  be seven in number and  consist of one Indian  Minister from  a province, one  civil  officer, one military officer, one European non-official and three Indian non-officials.     -1. AS regards terms  of reference,  we  not  only agree (hat  such a  Committee should be entrusted with investigation of possibility of reducing military expenditure, but consider  that this is  essential  if Committee is to be of  any real value, and we propose the adoption of terms of reference substantially the same as those laid down for  Geddes Committee, with  the necessary verbal  alterations, and  subject to  the proviso that Committee would  not  be asked to consider cpiestious such as number of combatant troops,  composition of  Army as between Indian and British troops,  or general questions of  policy regarding our relations  with external power or frontier tribes.     5. We shall be glad of  your early reply as to whether you agree generally with proposed scope of enquiry, as it is extremely  desirable we should  bo  in a  position to make  announcement at the earliest possible date.                 To Viceroy, Finance Department, llth March 1922.     1189.   Your Finance Department telegram of loth March.   Retrenchment Cora- mittee.  Geddes Committee was a body of five business men of  outstanding ability, conversant with finance and  public administration and working  in closest association with Treasury.   Its personnel was selected without  regard to political consideration, and it could  be trusted  not  to pursue political  aims  or to seek to  hamper the Government.     2. I conclude from your  assumption  that failing a chairman  of  recognised authority from home  you  must have  an Indian chairman,  and from  proposal  in para. 3 regarding remaining personnel that  you contemplate the usual  mixed Coin- mittee of officials and non-officials,  which would have  little of  the claims to public confidence possessed  by  Geddes  Committee and  would  probably  leave you  with majority and minority reports.   To such a Committee I am not prepared to remit the question of army expenditure.     3. I should  not object  to enquiry into  civil expenditure as originally suggested by you, though objections already stated apply with considerable  force even  to this. If you adopt this alternative I would suggest&apos; that  controversy  anil  inconvenience might be avoided if major questions of policy  were definitely excluded  in  terms of reference instead of their admission being left for separate consideration in each case on reference to the Viceroy.     4. Rut I  would  urge on you  that  it  is  of real  consequence to constitute  a Committee to  which  you  can  confidently entrust  the whole  field.  There  would, I hope, be  no difficulty in obtaining a suitable chairman in England.  It  is perhaps worth  mentioning to you that Sir Malcolm Hogg, now in India, possesses, if he can be induced to  serve, precise  qualifications to be sought in selection of members.  To maintain intended  character of Committee it would  be desirable to  exclude regular officials  altogether.  The Committee  will, I take  it, in any case work informally and in  closest touch  with  officials and departments whose assistance  they require.  The exclusion of officials would reduce   Committee to more convenient size while still leaving you scope for selection of best available talent, European and Indian.     5. As regards terms  of reference I attach much  greater importance  to  right-constitution of Committee than to  arbitrary restrictions  on  its scope.  Moreover,.. Chairman  of   standing  contemplated could  not be asked to  supervise a closely restricted enquiry,  If, therefore, you appoint a Committee such  as  I  have  in  view, I. should not object to adopting Geddes terms of  reference as they stand subject only to necessary verbal modifications.   If such a Committee cannot be constituted, these terms  of  reference  will  require  reconsideration  as  indicated  above  and  army expenditure must be eliminated,     G. The Committee in either case should  be  appointed by and  report to Governor- General in Council.               From  Viceroy, Finance Department.  16th March 1922.     We think it desirable to let you know at once probable attitude by Legislature towards Finance Bill as result of  private information  we have  received regarding discussions which have been taking  place among various groups  of members, and as
shown also by.the attitude of  the  majority oi&apos; the Legislative Assembly  towards the-demand  for  grant now under vote.  It is impossible at present to be sure  whethercertain sections  will not pursue  the threat already reported to you of  dissociatingthemselves entirely from voting on  Finance Bill, or of  endeavouring to  throw it outen bloc.  But assuming that this will not be the case probabilities are as follows.     2. It is  certain that the  increase  in the  tax  on the import of machinery from2l: to 10  per  cent, will receive no support in either Chamber, ami will be  opposed  byEuropeans and Indians alike.     3. It is equally clear that opposition to the increase of the salt duty, and probably also to the imposition of the excise on kerosene, will be almost as strong, and that inany case these two measures are likely to be rejected by  huge majority in Assembly.Further, it is highly improbable that a Council of State would agree to reinsert them..     4. As regards cotton excise, influence of Bombay mill industry, coupled with theprevious history  of this duty, will be, we understand, sufficient to secure its rejection.     5. As regards  the remaining items of the taxation scheme, although  there islikely to he opposition to individual  items, particularly postal rates  and  matches, wethink it, at any rate, not unlikely that we may  be able to carry these on their merits.     G. Result of the rejection of the above four items will mean  an  increase  slightlyover 9 crores of  rupees in estimated deficit,  i.c,  a  total deficit of nearly 12 croresof  rupees, to which must be added the indeterminate liability  in respect of theexpenditure of a (sic) in  Waziristan above that provided  for  in the Budget.  for reasons which we have already given  in our  Budget  telegrams, we are of opinionthat the  attempt  to finance uncovered deficit of this size  would  result in  very serious consequences.  It  will certainly  be argued in Legislature that most, if  not  all, ofthis uncovered deficit, should be covered by large reductions in  military expenditure.Nevertheless, we are informed that, it is likely that proposals  will, be put  forward in Assembly  for alternative measures in order to make up some of  the revenue lost by  the above reductions.   Thus we are informed that the non-business interests  inthe Assembly have promised  to  support the rejection of the cotton excise, providedthat  business  representatives agree to  increase of half  an anna  in super-tax  oncompanies,  which  would  yield  about .175 lakhs.   We do not  know   for  certain whether  this suggestion will materialise.     Secondly,   lie-imposition of import duty on silver is likely to be proposed.   Thiswall  no  doubt meet with opposition from Bombay members, but that opposition maybe conciliated if  proposal is accompanied  by unconditional remission of  duty on  allexport of silver.     Thirdly.   We understand that considerable  number of members in Assemblyare  likely  to support the proposals, which will  be put forward  from  Bombay, to-increase  the import  duty  on yarn  from 5 to 15 per  cent., on grounds that  there isno reason why this, having once  been,  taken  off the- free list,  should not be put  ingeneral ad valorem class.   Extra  revenue obtainable would be about 70  or 80 lakhsof rupees.  It is possible, however, that in order  to conciliate  those  members who,desire to foster the hand-loom industry, proposer of this change may confine  increase.of duty to lower counts.   -  Fourthly.  It is possible  that proposals will be put forward   for imposition  of export duty on oil seed, manure, bone, &amp;c.     7. You will recognise that above is merely an  indication  of  probable  attitude and cannot be taken  as authoritative until majority of the Assembly formally declare.their attitude on  the 20th.   It is  clear,  however, that it will be necessary for us to*take   immediate   decision  during  the  passage  of  the Bill  regarding  alternative:measures mentioned in preceding  paragraph.   As you  will  have gathered from oui-Budget telegrams, these measures are not such as we, ourselves, would have initiated.;Nevertheless, you will no doubt agree that it is of great importance, if at all. possible,to avoid  the deadlock, and it  may be desirable to  give  way in respect  of  some atleast of  above alternative  measures in order  to get  Finance  Bill passed  by bothHouses.   Our present  object, therefore, is  to  warn  you. that  we  may be obliged to-use our own  discretion  during passage of the Bill.     8. We take the opportunity: to mention that it is clear from, the attitude of theLegislature during general discussion on Budget, and also from that of the Assemblyduring current  vote on demands, that  if we  had been  in a  position to promise areduction  in  military  expenditure next year, or  to  make   statement. regarding;
Ihdianisation of Army, present opposition to tlie Budget as a whole would have  beenvery  materially diminished.   We have,  indeed,  been  definitely informed  that alarge section, probably amounting to  a  majority of the  Assembly, would  even nowpass the Finance Bill with some  modifications, such as  omission of salt duty, if  we -were in a position to give such an assurance.     9.  Effect of vote on  12 demands so far considered has been to effect  reductionof about 40 hdchs.   Most  of these have  been made, not  with  reference to merits ofthe individual demands under vote, but  with  a view to  effecting summary retrench-ment.               Fi-om Viceroy, Finance Department, llth March 1922.     Please refer to para. No. 4  of our telegram of 16th March last.  Budget.  Further-information regarding attitude  of  the  Legislature indicates that  feeling  againstincrease in cotton excise is widespread, and  not  confined to  Bombay or  particular interests  affected.  In spite of  our  declaration  to  the  contrary,  members of  theLegislature persist in believing that increase is proposed in deference to Lancashire^interests,  and there is likely to be practically no support for proposal when finance bill is taken into consideration  next week.                 To Viceroy, Finance Department,  11 th March  1922.     1197.  Your Budget telegrams of 16th and 17th March.   I entirely  share yourdesire to avoid  deadlock  if possible, and  it was with this  object that I have agreed to-suspend compulsory use  of Paper Currency Reserve profits for deflation.   Similarly Iwould endorse a   policy of conciliation  by  accepting  any   practicable  alternative proposals  for  new taxation calculated  to produce approximately same revenue  asmeasures  objected to, provided  of  course that the  main scheme of  your Budget isnot undermined.     2. As regards dropping of  increase  in cotton  excise, and imposing lb per cent.on yarn  and  introducing a wide export tariff, 1  would  observe that your original proposals maintained so  far as revenue  position allowed existing balance in generalscheme of taxation, while adoption of the suggestions above mentioned would disturbthat balance to an  undesirable degree,  and  incidentally prejudice  findings of FiscalCommission  now  sitting.   While proposal to  increase  company  super-tax  by  halfanna might per se  be accepted, it does not afford suitable set-off to proposed increase-in cotton excise, which yon  spontaneously and I think properly proposed, and whichI consider must be retained as an integral feature of your Budget.     3. As regards silver duty you are  aware of  objections  previously taken to  thisincluding its very uncertain yield, a point of  particular  importance  in the coming year,  and I  do not understand  what is  meant by unconditional remission of dutyon  export.  If intention is that this  would  involve  automatic drawback  of dutyirrespective of whether actual silver has paid duty or not, proposal would require careful consideration with a view to avoidance of abuses.     4. I  recognise that the  rate of   additional  salt  duty   may be  a  matter  for negotiation, though I should deprecate the abandonment of the  proposal altogether.This  has always  been  recognised   as  a legitimate  reserve  and  no greater fiscalemergency is likely to arise.      5. In order to make my attitude  as clear as possible,  though not  absolutelyinelastic, I would suggest to you that a true deficit of  some 4 or 5 crores might in allthe circumstances be admissible, but that one of,  say,  10  or 12 crores would bedangerously excessive.   By true  deficit I mean  in each  case the deficit  which wouldbe left after (a) removing the provision for applying  Currency Reserve profits to  the-cancellation of ad hoc securities,  and  (&amp;)  making additional provision for Waziristan.      6. I  am bound from the general tenour of your telegrams &quot;to assume that  the-requirements of the financial situation cannot be met without the use of your powers under section  67B  of the  Government  of India Act, and  you  may rely upon  mysupport in any action which you may consequently take.  No doubt  you have care-fully considered the procedure  required to  operate section 67B.  I understand  thatit involves formal recommendation of Bill in a particular form to Assembly before-motion to pass the Bill is put to  Assembly.      5276                                                                 B
    7. With reference to arbitrary cuts made in connection with demands for grants,your spokesmen have doubtless  pointed  out that you are desirous of effecting every possible  economy, and intend to bring such  economies as may be found practicableinto  immediate operation, even  though Assembly should  have approved higher scale of expenditure.   It  is not possible to undertake to give practical  effect to  whollyarbitrary  curtailment  of a vote, and  1 assume  therefore that you are intending to restore reductions so  made, particularly  under revenue  heads  where starvation of administrative expenditure  might  involve more than proportionate  loss of  revenue.Here again you will have my support in use of your special powers.                         From  Viceroy,  IStli March 1922.    Private and personal.  Please refer to my Financial telegrams 835 F. and 840 F.,dated 16th March and 17th March, regarding probable attitude of Legislature  towardtaxation proposals.   Finance Hill comes under discussion  in Legislative Assembly on20th.  and 21st.   1  have naturally  been considering  anxiously what  action,  if any, Ishall  take, in  virtue  of  extraordinary  powers conferred  on  me,  personally,  bysection 67B of Government of India Act, in the event of  Legislature declining  to passFinance  Bill, either in whole or in part.    There are two  possible contingencies:  first, that Legislature  may deliberatelyprovoke  complete deadlock  in order  to  show their  disapproval of present scale ofexpenditure,  particularly military ;  this they would  do by refusing  to pass finance bill  in any form.   In that  case I should, of course, have to accept challenge andcertify some, at least, of the taxation proposals.  Tho second and, as I gather, much the more probable contingency  is, that  Assembly  will  follow  advice  of  the more moderate and business sections, and  will confine  itself to  rejecting those taxationproposals which are  regarded with  particular dislike  hy the country at  large.  If thiscourse be followed, then I understand that the following  four  taxation proposals onlywill  be rejected, namely,  cotton excises salt, machinery, and  kerosine.  The effect would be to diminish total  yield  from taxation by slightly over  nine crores.   Asagainst this, notice of  a non-official amendment  has  heen given to  suspend operationof section 13 (3) of Paper Currency Act, which  would mean an  addition to revenueresources of about  3 crores.    It  seems doubtful  whether other  alternatives   for additional  taxation, mentioned in para. G of  Financial  Department  telegram 830 F.of 16th March will materialise.   -Net result would be increase in uncovered  deficit ofabout o crores.  I understand that  influential section in Assembly favours this  course,because  they  consider  by  leaving  a  gap  of  this   dimeusio,   they  will forceGovernment to take effective steps further to reduce civil and  military expenditurein order  to produce equilibrium.   They are, in fact, in  somewhat of  a  dilemma.   Onthe other hand, the)&apos; are very anxious to  avoid  forcing me to exercise extraordinarypowers under the Act, as they are genuinely apprehensive as to reaction  of  such astep on success of Reforms Scheme.  On the other  hand, again, they fear that, it theyvote the  whole scheme of taxation,  even after protest, they wull surrender their powerto force Government to retrench.     2. As regards the particular four items mentioned above, taxation  on machineryhas, as you know, been opposed unanimously, both by European and Indian opinion,and mainly on non-political  grounds I. feel satisfied  that  this item must be dropped.As regard the cotton excise, salt and possibly also kerosine, my provisional view is, thatit would be politically unwise for me to exercise extraordinary powers.  Opposition is,so widespread that I fear imposition of such taxation, by use of such powers, mighthave worst effect on moderate opinion in the  country,   particularly in  view of attitude which  we  have been obliged to take   up in regard, to prospective reduction of military expenditure.  I am sure you will agree with me as to the vital importance of:  doing all ^ve possibly can to  carry moderate  opinion  with -us in present political conditions in India.      3. A further fact which makes it difficult for me to use extraordinary powers is impending appointment of  Retrenchment Committee, regarding  which please see my Government&apos;s official telegram  from Financial Department. 807 F., dated 15th March. Opinions may differ as to  the   extent of actual retrenchment which that Committee may be able to effect,  but, obviously, 1. should be in  a much stronger  posidon to insist on adoption of measures  to balance- revenue  and expenditure after  Retrench- ment Committee&apos;s investigation, and  after adoption  by my Government of such of its
proposals as we can accept.   I should then be  able to take my stand on the groundthat the  expenditure  had been  got down to bed-rock.  My conclusion, therefore, isthat provided Legislature votes  substantially all the remaining taxation proposals, itwill be as well to accept decision, and to let Finance Bill as so amended become law.                          To Viceroy, 20th March 1922.    Private and personal.   Following from Sir L. Worthington-Evans.  Your telegramof the ISth March.   I agree with you  that  it  is most desirable to carry moderate opinion with you and I agree that moderates will  be loth to force you to use yourpowers for fear of the reaction such attitude on  their part will have upon the reforms.I think you may well give  way on the machinery tax, but  if you give way on  thecotton excise, the salt tax, aud kerosine, you will in fact be giving way entirely ami beallowing your whole  budget balance to be upset and  thereby be acquiescing in anunreasoning and  obstructive protest against  absolutely necessary expenditure.   Sucha course  is not in the interest of India, for it would cause a deficit which, with  theWaziristan excess, would be  altogether excessive and thus damage India&apos;s credit andthe possibility of borrowing  both for railway  development and in case  of - final needfor any unforeseen contingencies which events of the year may give birth to.   Thereis indeed but  little difference between the two possible contingencies you mention.The first is sheer misuse of constitutional powers.   The second is  in form not mereabuse of  powers,  but. is in fact so unreasonable a use  as to destroy the whole scheme offinance for the  year.   Not  merely is  it destroying nearly one-fourth  of the  newtaxation,  but it  is altering the relation between direct and  indirect taxation,  whichremains  substantially  different  in  incidence to  that proposed  by  the  Government.I do not  think, therefore, that in either contingency you should hesitate to use yourpowers, and I hope that if your representatives allow it to be known privately that youwill use  your powers the moderates may advise acceptance of the inevitable  ratherthan provoke a partial breakdown at such an early date.
