       Housing of the Import .&quot;.1 War Musem*    Momoranrttmi &quot;by tho Pirst Oommjesj onnr of Works.          Last August the Cabinet directed me to set upa Committee to examine my proposal to house the War Museumin part of the Imperial Institute.    Although at its final meeting on the 27th February tho Committee acceptedmy scheme by a majority, all three of the members presentdirectly representing tho Institute and. Dominions strongly opposed the Idea as inrpalring the character and efficiency of the Institute, and two others had previouslyallied themsolves with this oxprcccicn of opinion*  ...     My difficulty is thr.t the lease of the CrystalPalace, at an inclusive rental of  25,000 a year/ expiresin April, 1924.   Tho payment.is so high and the place soremote and unsuitable  (200 tarpaulin sheets have to bekept to protect  the  6&apos;*diibite  from rain pouring  throughthe  roof)j that&apos;alternative accommodation is imperative.I told tho.War Museum Trustees that I could not approach  -the.Treasury  for a new  building,  and the Trustees havemot  me by.;reducing their  indent  for  space by 60^.   Theyhwe also reduced their forthcoming  ostimatos by Sof...I myself  believe tho War  Musoum  to be an  Important  andinteresting unit, recording, as it  does  tho&apos;greatest eventIn  the history of the  British race..  The proposal  to abolish  it, which was  several times  conveyed by representatives of  the Institute,  would be looked upon as a bitter affront by  soldiers  in  general.           The position of the Institute is quite clear.Pour years  ago its work Was examined by a strong Royaldocument is the prop or tv of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government
Commission comprising four- Dominion representatives *The unanimous report condemned the management and utiipf the Institute in scathing terms.  Lord Mljner there,upon circularised the Dominions and, Colonies for large                                                     Icash contributions, in order to start the place afresh 21,000 a year has now boon promised by tho crown colonies and Protectorates in addition to which theDominions contribute  8,000.    Tho Falkland Islandsoontributo more than Newfoundland and South Africatogether, the Malay States more than Canada, and Nigeras much as Australia and Hew Zealand combined.  It Ispalpablo that Crown Colonies have boon impelled to pajmuch more than self-governing Dominions.   The latter,course, have opened their own establishments in thecommercial centres of London and  can feel  small onthusifor the Institute whicli they havo long neglected.  The1joint previous contribution amounted to  1,667 perI may add that tho Government of  India has announced the Indian. Section is so unsatisfactory that the  exhiWare to be dispersed and the Indian  contribution of flva yoar is to bo stopped.     THE Treasury has dono  its utmost to make  the positeasy for the Institute, which already costs large  sumsthe Exchequer  (e.g.  10,000 grant-in-aid,   5,000contribution in-lieu of rates,  10,000  expenditure by i,own Department on maintenance  services,  etc.)   TheTroasury offer to reimburse Outlay  on re-arrangement ofexhibits and. the necessary-redecoratlon,  also  to  pay refor the  space.-transferred&quot;  to  the  Museum,  and finally tobuild a  large new exhibition bay &apos;&apos;for tho  Institute, son3,700 sq. ft,  in area,   I  may  say  that  the total spaceoccupied by the Institute,  apart  from tho  London      &apos;University,  is 153,000  sq.  ft.    By using  a Gallery ndempty for 8  or 10 months in  the  yoar, by  absorbing thospace India means to  surrender,  and by  taking  into accfl
7,500 sq. ft. my own Department 1B prepared to hand over,together with the proposed new hay,  the net reduction of space involved by my scheme amounts to 4,500 sq. ft. or .8If&apos; of the total.          I have throughout emphasised my opinion that by concentrating existing exhibits and eliminatingacknowledged trash, the value of the exhibition aswhole will be greatly enhanced.   Nevertheless the institute has met every proposal with uncompromisinghostility.   This is the only case in my experiencewhere a Public Department has maintained a resoluto nonpossuraus to my claims for concentration and economy.&quot;Many Departments have argued with great and perhapsunanswerable force that my economies impair their - -efficiency; but  all alike have co-operated with such goodwill and public  spirit that I havo been able  to reduce myGlass I Estimates by 34$.          I  fully  appreciate the difficulties of  theSecretary of State for the Colonies in  the matter.   Thoyare  real and indeed formidable.  Pressure  from a  Dominionmay  prove irresistible where domestic  opposition  couldbe ignorod.    Tho  situation, however,  is urgent,  as no alternative  site for tho Museum  exists.    Steps to  ensurerehousing of the War Museum by March,  1924, must  he taken during  the  current month.          I  suggest  that  the  Cabinet  as a  whole  shouldrecord  its  opinion in  favour  of  my modest  scheme,  and that in transmitting the  decision to  Dominion Governments,the  Secretary  of State  should  himself add.  a pressing request for  acquiescence  in  the  general interest  of promoting  economy  and  to  remove  a source of grave embarrassment,  giving  at  tho  same time an  assurance that the  concessions offered by the Treasury go far to meet objections  to  the  proposal.   C. &amp; B.15th March,  1922
