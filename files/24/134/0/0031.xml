A GREEK ;WARSHIP AT CYPRUS.              Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner              of Cyprus to the Secretory of State for the Colonies.                          Dated 9th March, 1922.              (Received Colonial Office 8.15 aam0 ioth March,1922)           (Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies).               A Greek Warship named IERAX anchored on the         afternoon of March 9th off Cape ANDREAS, where despite         the Customs Officer&apos;s protests an officer and man forced         a landinga   The Customs Officer at Cape Andreas told the         Greek officer that they could not be permitted in view         of instructions which he had received to land there but         if they required anything must proceed to Pamagusta the         nearest port, fifty miles distant^   The Greek officer         replied that he insisted upon landing.   He landed and         proceeded to the monastery where he had a hurried         Interview In secret with the ABBOT and subsequently         departed.   Against this violation of the law and territory         of Cyprus by an armed ship of war I must protest in the         strongest manner of which I am capable and I urge         immediate steps be taken to secure from the Greek Govern-         ment the fullest satisfaction for this occurrence.                                               STEVENSON.
