Copy No:   ^_,                          CABINET.8.P.3821.                  FOOT-AMD-MOUTH DISEASE.           Memorandum hy the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.              I  shall he glad to receive the authority of the Home    Affairs  Committee of the Cabinet for the introduction of the annexed    Bill  which  has heen prepared in order to carry out the decision of    the Cabinet  (C.15 (22) Minute 7) that one half of the total net    expenditure  incurred by the Ministry in dealing with the present    series of Foot-and-Mouth Disease will be defrayed by the Exchequer.    I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer desires that the    contribution from the Exchequer should, so far as possible, be paid    in  the present financial year and the draft Bill will enable this    to  be done.   The Treasury and  the Ministry of Health have condlirred    in  the terms of  the draft Bill  which should be introduced as sobn    as  possible in order that it may be passed into  law before the ishd    of  this  month.              It will be necessary  also to present a Supplementary    Estimate to  Parliament  for the  provision of the money, which can be    found from  the savings  on the Ministry1e Vote for the present    financial year.   The Supplementary Estimate will, therefore,    be  taken at  a token sum of  5 but it will authorise the payment    of  a  sum of  400,000 to the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account for    Great Britain, which together with the sum of l00,000 which has    already  been provided in the Ministry&apos;s Estimate for 1922-23 as a    Grant in Aid of  the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account will make up     the sum  of   500,000, which is 50fc of the estimated total expenditure    which will  be incurred  in dealing with the present series  of  out-    breaks  of Foot-and-Mouth Disease.              My Department is in communication with the Ministry of    Health  as to the necessary adjustment of the Local Taxation Account
in order to secure that the charge on that account shall bespread evenly between the present financial year and1922-23.                               A. G.
