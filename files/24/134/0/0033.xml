FS J* Jl                   0, A B.....I&apos;. NjE T.J?, 3833      DISBARMENT OP THE ROYAL IRISH, C0ES1 ABULARY,  -           &apos;&apos; (Memorandum by the&apos;&quot;Treasury).  ..;;  : -       -   -     ::-      i. .     Under the Government of Ireland Act. such  of the RJ-.C,as were cpmnuIsovrly retired when - that &quot;body was transferredto the North and South Ireland&apos; Government, were to receivespecially generous compensation terms.     These terms included the following  special provisions-(l)  ,Fcr the purpose cf calculating pension 12 years was     added tc the actual number of years served.(2)  The pension &quot;based on this increased number of years     was calculated not on the actual salary at date of     retirement but cn what the salary would have been     if the man had in fact served the actual  12 years,(3)  Any man who had served more than 8 - actual years,     making with the 12 added years a notional 20 years,     counted any year;s service above the notional 20,     double for pensionable purposes,     Typical results of this generous scheme would be asfollows r-     Constable with 5 years1 actual service -  pension for life   26/- weekly.     Constable&apos; with 15 years&apos; actual service &apos;- pension  for life -  2. 13, 10 weekly,             \\  ..     Sergeant of 9 years&apos; Police service with  conceivablyonly 1 month as Sergeant &quot;?ould receive for life a pension of  2. 1, 3 a week.        , w;IS D0CUM2SUT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOA/ERJMBNT )* .
     These pensions &quot;being given not,to men on reaching&apos;old age or invalidity but to &quot;men in complete possessionof their strength and. fully, capable of earning theirli velihood,     Tho cnly cases in vhioh the pension would be suspended would be if they entered other Police Forcesur other employment paid from the Crown,                       II.     As the result of the present decision to. disbandthe whole R.I.C, the above compulsory terms will new &quot;begiven, not merely to the comparatively small number whowould have been compulsorily retired on the transfer ofthe R,I*C. under the Government cf Ireland Act, but toall regu 1 ar meinbors of tlie P.,I,C.     The cost of theso&quot;pensions is estimated at  1,300,000per annum.     If he desires to emigrate from this country, the pensioner may commute so much of hie pension as *--ouldpay his passage and give him  300 capital on arrival.,                       III.     Two additional benefits have been arranged, but have yet to be communicated to the men concerned.;     (a)   Pensioners who stay in Ireland will be allowed     to commute in favour of a quarterly annuity for 2 years     so much of their pension as will increase their     emoluments for the first two years during -which it is     conceivable that they may have some difficulty in     obtaining employment if they remain in Ireland.   The                                                  effect/
     effect of this compensation would be to raiso the     pension for the first 2 years to 30 of the notional                                      Jo     pay, giving even constables nearly  2, 10. 0 a week.    . (b)   Any man who wishes, to.-leave South Ireland will    . receive a Disturbance.Allowance for removal calculated.     with regard to the size cf his family:-               1 month&apos;s pay to bachelors.               2   &quot;      &quot;   &quot; married men,               3   &quot;      &quot;   &quot; married men with 3 children,,.  .         The oost of this proposal might be anything from      200,000 to  300,000.                  -  , .     IV,     In addition a &quot;strong impartial Tribunal11 has been promised to consider individual cases of special hardship,with pcvver presumably to recommend additional grants.-           ; -     &quot; ^ , .    /  V.     It is submitted that the combined effect of the aboveScheme constitutes a very generous Whole, far in excess ofany known scheme for compensation for loss of Office, andamply meeting the Government pledges in their most generousinterpretati -on;                        &apos;  VI.     General Tudor (who is not a:;are of the proposals under-Ill (a) and (b) ) puts forward a plan for the payment of gatuities to all Irish members cf the force at an estimatedcost.of  1,250,000.   This plan apparently involves a bonusof. two weekspay for each year &apos;s service, with a minimum of  25 to- single men and  50 for married men, and.a maximumcf    one year&apos;s pay.     This Scheme is not supported by the Chief Secretary,                              &apos;                    but/
       --tout he proposes,  jn addition to the benefits under I, II,         III,  IV and V,  a special gratuity to all members cf the R I.C.         costing about  310,000.    His suggested Scheme is a month&apos;s         pay to each single man,  two months&apos;  pay tc each married man,         and  5 for each child under 16.              The Treasury see no justifieation for this additional         grant.   In their view the provision already agreed (tut         not yet publicly announced) is very generous and meets all         reasonable claims in. respect of all circumstances of special         hardship:, and .o&apos;n financial grounds there is no justification         for any more..
