IS DOCUMENT IS TEL PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S  CK)VEMBftJK.cabin et.SQjgiWES 1&apos;OK TRAINING EX-SBRvTCS-jm IN TEE BUILDING TRADE.MElaORANDUk BY THE MINISTER Off LABOUR-his.       My colleagues will remember that after lengthy negotiationsconcerning the training and employment of ex-Cervice  men In  thebuilding trade, the National Federation of  Building  Trade Employers   discussed with the Prime Minister in February 1921,  proposals  for1   training 50,000 ex-Servioe men in the trade.   The employers   accepted the soheme with alaority, and the scheme was launched in   April.   Owing to the effect of the ooal strike and subsequently ofI   the continued industrial depression, the employers have been unable   to carry out the promises which they originally gsve.   Out of   26,000 applicants, only 400 men have been admitted to training tinder   thi scheme, including a good proportion taken on by Government   Departments.  I have had repeated discussions with the Building ffirade   Employers urging them to improve on these figures, but on the  9th   January they made it clear that owing to the depression in the trade   there was no immediate prospect of adding to the number taken  on.          The Building Trade Unions have, of course, been hostile to  the   scheme from the beginning, but have not generally interfered with   those men who started work.  On the -ith November last, however, the   National Trade Advisory Committee for the Building Trades,  a  jointI   body of employers and trade union representatives who assist my   Department in schemes for training disabled ex-Servioe men in  the   Government Instructional Factories, unanimously passed a resolutionR  that the Disabled Men&apos;s Scheme was being jeopardised by the fit menTs   scheme, and that consequently the Committee were unable to come to a   decision regarding the proposal for the acceptance of a further 8,000   disabled men to be trained for the building trades.    I have reason
   to hope that if the fit men&apos;s. scheme were stopped we should be able   to obtain the consent of the building trade to the acceptance for   training of a considerable number of disabled ex-Service men though   perhaps not the full 8,000 in question.   These men would not come   into the trade, even as improvers, till a period of 12 months  has   elapsed by which time it is hoped that an improvement in the   position in the building trade will be apparent.           The representations made by the employers about the prospect   of the fit men*s scheme have convinced me that to continue this   scheme is to flog a dead horse.   The employers did not want the   scheme formally abandoned because in their opinion that would be a   surrender to the trade unions,but they were unable to promise that   they could vitalise the scheme in the near future, and as a nominal   continuation of the scheme is standing in the way of progress with   additional disabled men,  I have reluctantly oome to the conclusion   that it is necessary to abandon the fit men&apos;s scheme.  The employers   have not been able to fulfil the promises they held out, and ascribe   their failure entirely to the industrial depression.            I suggest therefore, that we must accept this position and   take steps to wind up the scheme and then proceed with the training   of as many disabled ex-Service men as we can find room for in the   trade.  In the interests of the disabled men a very early decision   is desired.                                        (Sgd.)  TeJ. MAC1U.MABA.   Minis try of Lab our^\   fo&amp;roh 7th,1922.
