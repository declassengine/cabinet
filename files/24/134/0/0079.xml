REPORT 3Y THE GENERAL OFFICER GQMI.UIIDDIG-                   IN- CHIEF Oil THE SITUATION IN IRELAND 0,P. 3879.        PGR V/EEE ENDING 18th March,  1922,           *Circulated by the Secretary ef State for War.)1*   Since the last report the following movements from ireland have taken place :-On 12th, &amp; 13th.

At the request of the provisional Government the finalevacuation of LIMERICK which was to have been completed on18th, March has been postponed till  1st. March.     In order to strengthen and relieve the strain on thetroops forming the Garrison of Belfast two additionalBattalions (1st. Royal Sussex Eegt. and 2nd. Cheshire Regtc)were moved into the town from Ballykinlar cn 12th &amp; 15th *inarch respectively.3.   After consultation with irield-Marshal Sir Henry Wilsonwho is advising the Northern Government regarding the defences of ulster, I have issued orders for two furtherBattalions, 1st. v-.,uc on1 s Royal Regt * from PERMOY and 2nd.Suffolk Regt. from CURRAGH to move to ULSTER DISTRICT(CLANDE30YE and BALLYICINLAR respectively) o4.   The number of outrages in BELFAST shows no diminution,the casualties during the past week (12th. March to 29th.inarch) being -Protestants           5 killed              27 woundedRoman Catholics       7 killed              29 woundedPolice                2 killed                 woundedMilitary              - killed               1 wounded           TOTAL     14 killed              47 wounded5.   With regard to the Election Campaign which is beingcarried on by both the Treaty and Anti-Treaty partiesthroughout the Country, reports from impartial sourcesindicate that when the Election takes place the results, willnot be dependent on the wishes of the elect orate so much ascn the power of De Yalera*s party to instil sufficient fearby phystical force, and on the power of the ProvisionalGovernment to prevent such terrorism.  At tfc.a presentmoment the odds seem slightly in favour of De ^lezar*
6,   On the border between Northern and Southern Ireland,although a state of tension exists natters are comparativelyquiets   Most of the reads have,  as a protective measure,  been blown up on the Northern side of  the border, as the Northernersrealise that raids by the LR.A,  are likely, and that thesurest way of preventing such raids is to take steps toprevent the use of mechanical transport for raids and for subsequent escapes&amp;     Dr0 Ward the Representative of the Provisional Governmentwith the Southern Liaison Commission, although nominally stillattached to the Commission has practically ceased to have any dealings with the British Officers, and carries on his duties on the Staff of the I*RCAC Division to which he belongsfThe following example is typical of his attitude -On Friday last In order to clear up a point with regard tothe exact locality of an arrest carried out by UlsterSpecials just V/est of Londonderry, I directed ColonelMontague-Bates and a member of the Northern Commission toprbceed+g Londonderry*   In accordance with my instructionsDra Ward/informed of the action to be taken, but declined to accompany my representatives as &quot;he was of the opinionthat in any case the Northern Authorities had no right to arrest any members of the I.R.A. who happened to be InNorthern territory&quot;r     It will be seen, therefore, that the representatives ofthe Provisional Government not only maintain their right toraid into Northern territory in the event of their demandsnot being acceded to, but that they claim immunity for theirformations and units located within the six GountieSoThese formations consist of two I.R,A. Divisions (the 2ndand 3rd Northern) and portions of two more, (the 4th and 5th Northern)o   That these organisations are quite capableof action even within the six Counties is clear from the raidon Pcmeroy Police Barracks, Co. Tyrone, which took placeoil the 19th instant and which resulted in the loss of a large quantity of R.I*C. arms and equipment;,     It is perhaps too much to hope for, but it seems tothat the only way in which a peaceful atmostphere can bere-established in the North and on the border, is by the dis-avowel of the Provisional Government of all aggressive actionon the part of, the I.ReA, within the Northern Government vsterritory, and by the complete disarmament or withdrawal oftheir units from that territory,.   This might be arranged totake place simultaneously with the withdraw! of Britishtroops from Southern Ireland,8o   It has been constantly rumoured in the Press lately,that there is a likelihood of Jim Larkin being released fromImprisonment in America and of his return to Ireland,  Ifthis takes place the difficulties of the Provisional Governmentand possibly the Northern Government will be infinitelyincreased,, and a third militant force will be established in southern Ireland.9s,   I attached a statement dealing with the Military forcesof the Irish Free State  (Appendix la)(Signed)  CoPr,H0  MAG READY      GENERAL,C oraraanding.-in.-Chi ef,  IRELAND.GHQ.

APPENDIX  IcTHE MILITARY FORCES OF THE IRISH FREE STATE OPABOUTRAISED-NINGo     As far as can bo ascertained the present intentionof the Provisional Government is to build up a smallRegular Standing Army of about 25,COO from units of theIcRsA* that can^be relied on.   This force will consistof Infantry and the necessary administrative services Icavalry and artillery are nob contemplated at presents     In order to carry out this plan parties of aboutICO men from selected IoR*Ac Units are now being sentto Beggars Bush Barracks. Dublin,, for training9The period of training Is about one month, at theexpiration of which the men are supplied withuniform and equipment and are sent back to their areas to take over local barracks and thus form the nucleus of the new military forcesc               The system of training is based on that c et forth          in our War Office Manuals.   It is carefully and keenly          carried out. AND           The detachments from the Country on arrival atIPLINE.    Beggars Bush Barracks are admitted to be very raw and          untrained*   The general discipline however of both          officers and men is believed to be good.   Crime and          desertion seldom occur and the men t s a whole arecontented0Thisstate of affairs applicmore After theespecially to conditions in Beggars Bush,-,troops have besn stationed acme little time in country barracks a certain amount of desertion hasoccurred.
