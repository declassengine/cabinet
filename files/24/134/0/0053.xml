IIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)During the past week the following troops have left Ireland -15th. KIng&apos;s Hussars for TIDWORTH.1st. King&apos;a Regt.    for JERSEY.1st. York &amp;- Lancaster Regt.  for PEMBROKE,     The situation In LIMERICK after becoming acute in themiddle of the week has now been settled by the withdrawal - ofthe Provisional Governments troops, (which had been draftedinto LliViERICK) and the &quot;rebel&quot; forces.   The Strand barracks and Police Barracks in the town now being occupied by mainten-ance parties furnished by the local I. R. A. which are said tobe loyal to the Provisional Government.     It Is expected that the two British battalions will beable to leave LIMERICK at the &quot;end of this week, their departurehas been delayed by the late arrival and slow unloading of theship which is to move the Government stores.     Another curious case has occurred&apos; at Templemore where theold Military Barracks appears to be in the hands of the local&quot;rebel I.R.A.&quot;, a detachment sent down by the ProvisionalGovernment from Dublin was refused admittance and is nowbilleted in surrounding houses.while the &quot;rebel detachment&quot;still occupies the barracks..     On the 8th March a baggage guard of.;-lVN.. C..O, and :6 men was rushed by a parly of 30 &quot;or 40&apos;armed civilians at WA2ERF0RDRailway Station,   Snot,a were exchanged one  soldier waswounded and. at least one attacker W&apos;;-s known  to&apos;have been hit.The guard was overpowered and deprived of their arms, equipment and baggage.. &apos;.&apos;The question of responsibility for leaving so small an armedparty in an impossible position has been dealt with by theG,0.C.6th. Division.   This  is another instance of the. dangerever present in Ireland of troops being lulled into a sense of security by apparently peaceful surroundings.C R E T,CABINET.3655.REPORT BY GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEFON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR WEEK ENDED            11th March, 1922.(Circulated, by the Secretary of State for War).
     In BELFAST the situation is extremely unsatisfactory andthe loss of life by outrages and reprisals is on the increase,the numbers during the last month (10th.Feb.-11th.March) are -       The evening of the 10th. March was marked by the murder  of three members of the Crown Forces, Lieut.Bruce, Seaforth  Highlanders and two R.I,Constables.   These murders occurred in  areas Which are purely Roman Catholic and it Is thought that  they are the work of Republican gun men.   So far no information  is available that would show that the murder of LieutjBruce  was a premeditated murder or that he was followed.   It appears  more probable that he walked into a gang who would have  murdered any of the Crown Forces or Protestant civilians they  had encountered.       This outrage may not be unconnected with certain propaganda  against the Seaforth Highlanders communicated officially  by the Provisional Government to the Sunday Press last week  and the week before,   The statements made Were entirely un-  foundod, and I have taken the matter up  with the Provisional  Government, through the Under Secretary, but so far without  result.       The motive of these attacks on members of the Crown  Forces would appear to be an effort to prove the  lack of  power of the Northern Government to stop Republican terrorism.       The situation of the border between Northern and  Southern Ireland is quiet.   It has been found necessary to  witnriraw I,t, Col. J.Doia , D.S.O., M.C., the second Military  representative with the Southern Border Commission on medical  grounds.    It has not-been possible to find any suitable  officer willing to act  us a volunteer on this Commission,&apos;  consequently an officer is being detailed to assist and act  as a staff  Officer to Lt.Col.Montagu-Bates, CB.,  CMG.,DS0.,  the remaining military representative.       As reported last week the troops have  as  far as possible  from their  present positions been  doing all they  can to  assist  in the concentration  of  the R.I.C,  and in getting  any surplus arms from isolatud stations.    During the last  two days a  case has occurred in County Donegal where informa-  tion was obtained that  the surplus arms would be  raided in  transit between Letterkenny  and the Military Barracks,  Londonderry, and there  was even a  danger of the Police  Barracks at Letterkenny being  raided.   Steps were taken last  night to send out a rescue part&quot;&apos; of  troops  with Armoured cars  and the surplus arml/lafely  brought  in  to Londonderry  during  the  night.       The bulk of police have now been  concentrated and  con-  siderable numbers fire now being accommodated.
