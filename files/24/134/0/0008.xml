Document ie the Property ofiHis Britannlo Majesty^ Government). R3 T.              CABINET.             Copy No.53008.              Government Advertisements in the                  -   &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.Memorandum by the Chancellor of     the Exchequer.         In September 1920,  shortly after the Meynell disclosures,it was decided to withdraw Government advertising from  the  &quot;daily herald&quot;, mainly at the instigation of the Home  Office.         The &quot;Daily Herald^ now apply again to  receive  advertise- ments of Government issues.         The Treasury at present do vary little advertising ofbond issues, and they would not on general grounds  consider thatthe &quot;Daily Herald^ was a suitable organ for suoh advertisements.       :  On the other hand it is probably a very useful adve&amp;ti-sing medium for Savings Certificates and both  the Savings Committeeand the Treasury would be glad on merely financial, grounds  to renew advertising Certificates in it.         I think it is now no longer necessary to treat the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; specially on political grounds,  and  I should beglad, if my colleagues agree, to renew Certificate  advertisingaccordingly.  I understand that the paper is now managed by arepresentative Board of Directors, consisting of Mr, FrankHodges, Mr, Robert Williams, of the Transport Union. Mr. AlfredBarnes, of the London Co-operative Society, and Mr, W.C,Robinson,with Mr, Arthur Henderson and Mr. R.V.Walker,  of - the TradesUnion Coffgress, as Advisors.
