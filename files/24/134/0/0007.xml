Memorandum by the Chancellor of            the Uxehaquer.             EARLIBBIifbTTARY 3ATTOTMTUH&amp; OP  STATS SERVANTS. &apos;     1*   The Labour Party  are again pressing for a decision on he position of workmen  in  Government establishments who wish to ecome Parliamentary candidates.  The question, which cannot be onfined to the section  of  civil servants on whose behalf thelabour Party is concerned,  is a very important one involving aloiaeideration of the principles which at present govern the rela-Uon  of State Servants to Politics.     2.   The present rules may be summarised as follows                        CIVIL SEHVIC3.     (i) Parliamentary Candidature.   &quot;The existing rule isjontained in Clause 16 of the Qrdsr in Council of January 10th 910. which runs:-   &quot;Any officer seeking a seat in the House of Commons shall     resign hie office so soon as he issues his address to the     electors, or in any other manner publicly announces himself     as a candidate.M        Shis rule dates from 1884, when questions arising out of  oase of such candidature were asked in the House of Commons  d a Treasury Minute was issued notifying  the decision of the government on the subject, the provisions of which were subeequent- jr embodied in an Order  in Council.        The rule does not apply to a Civil Servant retired on eneion.     (ii) ^Candidature jfor County Counc ils . &apos;      The question of the candidature of Civil Servants fa County Councils arose soon after the passing of the Poal Government Act of  1888, and was determined b^ reply jWen by the First Lord  of the Treasury  on behalf of the p^rnmenk to a question in tl.j J&quot;Ou.; e tf Commons on the 6th                                                    December
Deoember  1668, a reply which was embodied In treasury minute of the 16th idem and circulated to the public departments for their information and guidance as the decision of theGovernment.          This was to the effect that members of the CivilService  are not permitted to become candidates for the CountyCouncils, because it is obvious that the discharge of duties on County Councils may seriously conflict with their duties in the Civil Service.      (iii)  Candidature for other Munioipal Bodies.           The general regulations prohibit candidature forBorough Council elections (whether in County or MetropolitanBoroughs) and in the ease of Parish and District Councils,Civil Servants are only prohibited from membership of Councilswhose meetings fall within the hours of official duty (treasury minute of August, 1804 h  Generally, the decision as tocandidature for these lesser &quot;Local Authorities is loft to the discretion of the Department concerned.     5.   The objections to Civil Servants in general taking apublic part in politics were cogently stated by the majority report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (1014) and&quot;maybe quoted here (ohap,^. paras,10-11)t-          nXn the first place, we have little doubt.that     complete liberty of political action for all officials     alike, would inevitably result infrequent - conflicts between     the  desires and interests of the officer as a oltiaen and     his- duty as an official, and that such conflicts could not     fall to have a disastrous effect on the morale of the     public service.           &quot;Such conflicts may occur without any direct breach     of official confidence.  Let us suppose an officer of the     Foreign Office making a speech on a public platform upon     some question of foreign policy, being at the time the     subject of diplomatic negotiations; or an officer of the     Treasury or of one of the great Revenue Departments  speak -     ing  publicly upon some controversial topic of taxation,     which might be the subjeot of acute party difference, such     as the recent Licensing legislation, or the Fiscal question     oi? an officer of the War Department taking a prominent     part in controversy as to the merits of  voluntary     and  compulsory service;   or again,  to take a                                                    less
       leso extreme instance, let us suppose that an officer       criticiaes the polioy, not of the department in which he       serves, but that of some other department or the policy       of His Majestye Government for the time being as a whole;       in all these cases there could be no doubt as to the       impropriety.of the officer&apos;s conduct and its inconsistency       with his position ae a permanent official.            &quot;We have already pointed out that the Civil Service       is now being called upon to take a greater share in the       burden of administration than was known a generation       ago;  and it cannot be dented that the. sucooss or failure       of much legislation of a controversial character depends       now much more largely than formerly upon administrative       action.  The conduct of the Civil Swrvioe will, therefore,       come more frequently under publio notice than it has done,       and in these Circumstances it would, we think, be disastrous       if the feeling should arise that the effectiveness of a       legislative policy ware inany degree dependent upon the       political bias of those administering it.;            &quot;Speaking generally, we think that if restrictions on       the politioal activities of public servants were withdrawn       two results would probably follow.  The public might       cease to believe, as we think they do now with reason       believe, in the impartiality of the permanent Civil       Serviced and Ministers might cease to feel the well-merited       confidence which they possess at present in the loyal and      &quot;faithful support of their official subordinates;  indeed,       they might be led to scrutinise the utterances or writings       of such subordinates, and to select for positions of       confidence only those whose sentiments were known to be in       political sympathy with their own.         ?r&apos; wIf this were so, the system of recruitment by opan       competition would prove but a frail barrier against       Ministerial patronage in all but the earlier years of       service; ., the Civil Service would cease t* be in fact an       impartial non-political body, capable of loyal service to       all Ministers and parties alike;  the change would soon       affect the public estimation of the Service, and the       reeu&amp;t would be destructive of what undoubtedly is at       present one of the greatest advantages of our administrative       system and one of the most honourable traditions of our       public life.&quot;     4,   The Majority Report of the Royal Commission went onto state (Section 14) that for the large number of subordinateI officials Hit will suffioe if a rule be enforced prohibitingthem from using their official position in any way to influenceelections whether for Parliament or for local bodies.&quot;I         It is no doubt with such officers that the presentapplication of the Labour Party is mainly concerned.     5,   Even if it were thought desirable to concede theimportant question of principle there are a number of practicaldifficulties to be considered.                                                         (i)
      (i)  The distinction which the Royal Commission -attempted &apos;to draw between the higher-*aiud..*ubcn^^              wouldprobably, be unworkable  n, practice  and It la impo-sTrlble toaay how or where the line could be drawn.   In the P^t-omo^.for example, and probably in other Departments, it la the       &quot;vsubordinate and middle grades who come most into contact with thepublic, and, who so reputation for political impartiality it isequally important to preserve.  It would be equality, if not morey-embarrassing for.a Sub-Postmaster, ^ho is well known locallyand has; access to all local:communications, to be labelled as a____political partisan than for a Headquarters officer who is relatively unknown. &apos;And. Imagine the;effect in the case of localRevenue Officials,. Inspectors of Taxes and others&apos;.:  v.v.i 1 i);v,Ifpthe existing,restrictions-upon political.&apos;activities are &amp;elaaied:-.ln it a^our of :Civj\ Servants why - standr for Parliament,theyrmuat ;also bo, ;*elq:ted in favour.of all Cfivii &apos;Ser *antrj whether-they are-actual ^adtdaiiea&quot; or not.  In fact, the possibilitymust.be facedof.:*^.a&amp;iderabia numbers of 9*fc&amp; Servants becomingrecognised adherenta and possibly agenda of political parties.This would I load not o;uy to - charge-3 - of&apos;  a:*tia?.:-.ty o&apos;r*  corruptionfrom the public but to accusations of political favouritism orprejudice in questions of promotion eta, within the Departmentsthemselves.         : -  ;-    (lii)  Excluding the case of the Revenue Departments, thereare perhaps special Considerations which make the maintenance ofthe existing restrictions wore important in the case  of thePost Office than in other De partner,ta.  fhe propaganda and organisation at an Election xa carried out mainly throughthe posts and telespaphn and numbers of subordinate PostalServants have the opportunity of *anpex**.ng with,  divulgingor withholding eomvauai o at ions passing through their hands.Offences of this character would probably be rare,  and  proof  andconviction would be rarer still, but it would hardly  be  possibleto maintain tho nub?...&apos;-, ^^i^ioc *n the  secrecy  and  Impartiality                                                          of
of the Post Office If its local officers were known to  havedefinite politioal associations; e.g. if the local  Postmaster were an avowed supporter of one party, would hie opponents he willingto let their confidential telegrams pass through his hands?    (iv)  A last point of praotieal importance is this.Suppose the request of the Labour Party to be granted.  an unsuccessful candidate for Parliament&apos;would in that event  be   .;  tpermitted to return to his post.  The successful candidate wouldresign it. &apos; But suppose that he loses his seat at a subsequentelection; will there not be a demand for his reinstatement?  this might be found diffioult to resist but a man who hovers betweenthe Civil Service and Parliament would be a very embarrassingservant for the- State to have.     6.   Oh the other hand there is nothing in the present regulations to; prevent a dockyard workman or a postman fromengaging in Trade Union activities of a definitely politicalnature.  It would not be possible at the present time to limit the Civil Servant^ right of association, and that rightadmitted, it&apos;is impossible to confine its  activities to non-political objects..  And it might perhaps be argued that manyof the dangers anticipated in paragraph 6  (ill) above could beobviated by the transfer of the officer la question to anotherdistrict. .7.   The question of Parliamentary candidature ofCivil Servants can hardly be fully considered without referenceto the regulations which obtain In the Fighting Services.  Forthe strongest argument for the relaxation  of the CivilService rules lies in the fact that the privilege is already&apos;enjoyed by officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force.     (1) Admiralty rules;          Naval Officer M.P.&apos;s on the active list are  usuallyalready on half pay but if not are placed  on half pay &quot;on or before election&quot;.   They  are not precluded by Regulation from                                     remaining
 remaining bh  full pay while  candidates for  Parliament.          While&quot; serving as Members&quot; of Parliament&quot;iheir time reckons&apos; as  half-pay time under the ordinary rules of the service, l.e.  one third of it counts as  service for inorease of  retired  pay, but it  does  not&apos; count as service to save them from retirement for non-service  after tbe period prescribed for suoh retirement.          Naval Officer K.P*&apos;8 retain their seniority and   out-. ty$ VL vi*,vr&apos;,.. Tir-t :v*-       t&quot;&apos;     H*f* ;u 1 v -1 : !..&apos;;^.&apos;.:t;t v  This do  not become supernumerary  to the establishment.          under the&apos; Resent  Regulations  governing half-pay a highei* rate&quot; of half-pay la given for thevfirst year of&apos; Kfcuw  &amp;$-.,xn*  Stats  to hiYv-                            &apos; &apos; unemployment  to officers waiting employment and holding themselves  at the disposal of the Admiralty than to those placed on half-pay at tbeii*  own  request. This higher rate Is  not appiicabie to Naval Officer M,P.&apos;s.      (11)  War Office rules8          The practice  of the dear Office as regards Array Officers who  become Members  of  Parliament is  as follows:-          The  Officer ban remain  on full  pay until the date of  his eieeiioxi.  He can then  be either seconded or  placed on half-pay.      The seconded officer.               jg! he half&quot;pay  officer. (Officers abeve Major have not         (Half&quot;pay  is open to  the opticn -ofvbaing seconded          officers of all ranks).  for this purpose) (a)  &quot;draws no  Army pay while  an         (a) draws  half-pay  with     H*f* cr-.afterwards  when              limii of  5 or in  special     au^;^r-merary waiting               case  10  years when he   - -absorption unless specially         must  retire.     employed  by the Army Council. (b)   retains  his seniority             (b) retains  seniority      absolutely.                          relatively  (if he is 6th                                          Captain,  he  returns as                                          6th  Captain). (c)   earns  no retired pay              (c)  earns no  retired  pay      while  seconded and seconded           while on half-pay and      service  does not count  as              half-pay service does     service towards increase of            not count as service      pay.-&apos;                                  towards  increase  of                                            pay,                                                      (d)

(...  ,                          i - restored.- &quot;          The explanation of the johoice. given is as follows.-          Before 1604 officers-of the rank of Major and lower rank could  if elected Hem bers of Parliament continue to draw full pay. their duties being performed by their btwtbor officers without extra remuneration, or they could elect to be seconded without pay,.,,          The Treasury urged that Army officers should at moat be placed  on half-pay till re-absorbed and in 1906 the War  Office  agreed to  this as a universal rule.          The grant of half-pay, however, involved the loss of  seniority, and thus practically put an end to the military career of regimental  officers.          Accordingly in 1011 the \iar Office asked the Treasury, who agreed, to restore the former option for majors and  lower ranks of being seconded without pay and in return retaining their seniority.      (ill)  Air Force rules.          These have not yet been laid down, but the AirMinistry have proposed that an officer on full pay or on half- pay Scale4A (which corresponds to the higher Admiralty scale) shall, if elected an M.P.,  be placed on Scale B (the lower scale) as from the date of election.          So far as  is known,  no case has ariaen in theFighting Services  of Parliamentary candidature by Warrant, Pettyor N.C Officers or  other ranks.
                                                         o.      8.  The reason why this privilege ie allowed to the fighting eervicee seems to be historical.  It ie a survival of an uhreformed Parliament.  It has, however, been argued in Justification of the privilege:)   (a) that it is desirable to encourage officers on the aotivo     i       list to enter Parliament to represent Service opinion on       defenoe questions;   (b)  that the intermittent oharacter of their employment        distinguishes them from Civil Servants.        The latter argument was probably of much greater validity whan the practice was established than it could ho held to  he  new.      9.   Constitutionally it appears anomalous that Members of parilament should remain in the service of the Crown and should draw pay (as distinct from retired pay) from,the Crown. If they retain the right of resuming their professional career in the tfavy, Army or Air Perce theifci future prospects of employ- ment or promotion theoretically depend on the favour of the Crown acting through Ministers.  There seems, therefore, much to  be  saidI for the view that,  as in the Civil Service, officers of the Fighting Services should be deemed to have retired as soon  as  they announce their candidature for Parliament, or, if that be thoughtj too draetio in view of the long period&apos; in which the oontrary ruleI has been in operation, that they should be seconded without pay! or half pay and without reckoning the period for pension aB from] the same date.  A special ruling is also required in respect ofI non-regular officers,  e.g. in the Territorial Army, for whom there are a certain number of whole-time or part-time paid posts  allow-I ed,  though it is not suggested that Members of Parliament shouldIIbe preoluded from drawing pay while serving as Territorialj or Militia officers for brief periods in camp.
     10.  The above rules,  it will be seen, present certainanomalies, especial Ly in the di-f f ercaiia t i aa made be toe enCivil Servants and officers of the Navy, Army and Air Porce.In the interests of uniformity alone it would b., desirableto remove these anomalies,  but in addition there&quot; is thedemand,  now voiced by the Labour Party, for a removal ofthe strict application of the rules to the subordinate grades of the Civil Service,     11.  There are three alternative policies to&quot; consider:   (A)  To maintain tho present position for the reason that,        though anomalous, It is established and works satis-     -   faotorily,   jB)&apos;  To modify the regulation &quot;that any officer soaking a        seat in the House of Commons shall resign his. office        so soon as he issues his address to the olectcrs, or  -   .   in any other marmei&quot; publicly announces himself as a .        candidate&quot;, In sft far as to exempt certain subordinate        grades suoh: as the dockyard workmen.   (C)  To&quot;maintain&apos; the regulation.and to extend it to officers        of tile Kavy,.  Army and Air Force.     12,  It ih svbmitted that&apos; the governing criterion in coming to a- oosjcJus-ifAl-. o.r the subject should be the,aycigs.jpcei all8 S3iS^IIj&amp;9Ji?$x t^-^^A?^^^--^ -nffiis...pub Ifrc servic as with thecalamitous;-,&apos;6faeequsnosE whioh that would eutail. and I am ofopinion that we should let the regulation operate as at present.
