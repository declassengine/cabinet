1 &quot; fCp^vlwrs^,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.5ELECTORAL REPRESENTATION.SECRET.CP. 3891P.7Memorandum by tho Minister of Health.          In connection with that, part of my MemorandumNo, CP,5813 dealing with tho extent of the alteration of our existing electoral machinery which would be necessary inconnection with the introduction of the Alternative Vote orProportional Representation, I wish to draw the. attention ofmy colleagues to Section 20(2) of the Representation of thePeople Act, 1918, from which it will be seen that legislativesanction has already been given to the introduction of proportional Representation in the election of 100 members.The Commission appointed under that Section have alreadyreported (Cda 9044, 1918). and a Schedule of new constituencieshas been prepared by - them. -   Lam not inclined to attach too much importance to the rejection oil the 13th May, 1913, of aresolution that the scheme prepared by the Commissioners shouldbe adopted.   The division took place Under vary different conditions from those now prevailing and&apos; in a thinly attendedHouse,          I need not recapitulate the full history of howSection 20(2) (c) of the 1918 Act came to.be enacted, but Iwould remind my colleagues that in the Bill as introduced bythe Government Clause 15(2)  provided that in an election forone member of parliament,  If there were more than twocandidates,, the election should be according to the principleof the Alternative Vote,   The sub-clause ao originallyintroduced.passed the  House  of Commons but the House of Lords                                                  amended/
amended the Bill so as to-set up  multi-member  constituenciesfor the return of 556 members whose election was  to  be byproportional Representation.   - Finally,  after  somevicissitudes, the Bill was,  as a  compromise, passed  in  itspresent form.   It is therefore apperent that  Parliament asyell as the Cabinet were not  opposed to  legislation  designedto prevent political poorer passing irrevocably in bo  the handsof one class.          I would remind my colleagues that provisionsdesigned to secure the equitable  distribution  of  politioalpower are not&apos;an innovation in English Parliamentary Elections.An attempt to secure the representation  of minorities was madein Mr, Disraeli&apos;s Reform Act  of 1867, but the  party  organisation for which the author of the Bill  was himself ma folly  responsiblefrustrated it, and &quot;it was dropped in the Reform Act  of  1885as a consequence of the abolition cf multi-member in favourof single member constituencies which were (mistakenly  as theevent has proved) recommended by  Mr, Gladstone because  theywent &quot;a very long way towards *Le.t is roughly  termed the representation of minorities&quot; ( 94 Hansard, 3rd series, p.380,Debate of December 1st, 1686)*                                   A, MOND                               27th March, 1922,MINISTRY OF HEALTH.
