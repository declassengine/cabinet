[This Document is the  Property of His^Britamiic Majesty s Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1922.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 3893.9CABINET.SUGAR POLICY.    I CIRCULATE the following Memorandum, which has been prepared by Mi.Wood since his return  from the West Indies.                                                                    w. s. c.    Colonial  Office, March 27, 1922.  MEMORANDUM REGARDING THE SUGAR POLICY OF HiS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.     The West Indian Colonies have been, and still are, suffering from acute economicdepression,  extending  to  all their principal  crops.    Of  these, by  far  the  mostimportant is that of sugar.  Strong representations with regard to the present stateof the sugar industry were made to us in practically every one of the Colonies visited,and  I am satisfied that, on the economic side, there is no West Indian problem which more urgently demands the attention of His  Majesty&apos;s Government.     The present difficulties of the sugar industry are due to various causes, of whichthe chief is  the unprecedented fall from the boom prices, due to the war, to a  price which, at its lowest (on the 28th December. 1921), amounted  to 8/. 25. 4-d. per tonc.i.f., New York (equivalent to 10 guineas per ton c.i.f., United Kingdom), the lowestprice for nineteen years.  To this figure should be added,  in order to arrive at an approximate estimate of the net price to the producer, say, 31. per ton in respect ofthe proportion of the preference received by him, and from it should be deducted, say,21. per ton in respect of insurance and freight, making the net price to  the  west indian  producer, say.  11/.  10s. per ton in the English market.  The comparablepre-war price  was 9/. to 9/. 10s. a ton f&apos;.o.b.     It is, however,  fair to add  that since the  28th December,  1921, the prices havebeen rising, and on the 8th March were 21. per ton more than in December.   This,however, still means that the producer receives less than 14/. per ton for his sugar.     While I was in the West Indies it was generally  represented that sugar  couldnot be produced remuneratively in the  Colonies unless  the producer could get 15/. aton for his product.  The present price in the United Kingdom, even with the wholeof the preference  added to it, is not enough to secure this return.     A further factor which has  produced the present economic depression in the sugar industry has  been the falling-off  in the demand for  the most important bye-product of the industry, viz.. rum.  Deliveries of  rum  for home consumption in theUnited Kingdom last year amounted to 2,036,532 gallons, as  compared with 3,331,009gallons in 1913, while  stocks have reached the abnormal figure of 11,689,000 proofgallons. Before prohibition America imported large quantities of rum from Jamaica,while previously to the war a special trade in British West Indian rum was  done with Germany. Both these markets are now lost, and the United Kingdom consump-tion  is prejudicially affected by  the present high rate of import duty.    Nor is it enough to say that the sugar industry had previously during the warenjoyed a considerable  period of favourable prices.  In the  case of the West Indies,the industry had been carried on for such a long time on a narrow margin of profit,that most of the estates were heavily mortgaged, and their machinery was antiquated.Much of the profits earned during the  years of prosperity were necessarily devotedto paying off charges and to buying new  machinery at war prices.   Moreover, inregard to firms domiciled in the  United Kingdom, owning estates in the West IndianColonies, the difficulties of  setting aside  proper  reserves  were accentuated by the excess profits taxation, which was claimed by  the Imperial Exchequer.    One further consequence of the  boom must be noted.   The bankers made largeadvances on the basis of the prices  which it was  expected in 1920 that the sugar      [8130]
crops would yield.  When the slump came, not only did many estates find themselvesinvolved far beyond their expectations, but the bankers had committed themselves tosuch an extent that they had in many cases to refuse all further advances.   Conse-quently,  the Local Governments have had to take special steps to meet the unprecedent-dented situation, notably in Jamaica, and now in Barbados and  British Guiana.These measures are, however, essentially  unsound, since they  involve guarantees tothe banks, for the bankers&quot; own business of financing the crops in those Colonies areemergency measures, which cannot be continued or repeated,  and involve liabilitieswhich cannot be met unless the sugar industry is restored to solvency.    Under these conditions the West Indies  look to the United Kingdom for help,and there are several factors which justify them in this attitude :     (a.)  The United Kingdom has given  preference  to the Dominions and Coloniesprincipally as  a token of  Imperial  solidarity.   Preference  in the West Indies,however, has been established partly as a token of Imperial solidarity but partly also as a result of bargaining with Canada for special advantages  to the West Indies inreturn for tariff concessions made by the&apos;West Indian Colonies to  Canada.  these concessions,  which were over and above what the West  Indies would have normallygranted in recognition of the obligations of Imperial solidarity, the United Kingdominsisted on having extended to herself, when the  negotiations with  Canada were completed.  The amount of the  preference given by the United Kingdom to the west indian Colonies (apart from cigars, wines, spirits and certain other miscellaneousarticles not affecting the  West Indies)  is 16f  per cent., whereas the  preferenceprovided for under the agreement between the West Indies and Canada varies from33  per cent, to 50 per cent., except in the case of Jamaica  and the  Bahamas, whereit is 25 per cent. (Jamaica has, however, already given  a preference of 40 per cent.on cotton piece-goods to  the United Kingdom).  The West Indies,  therefore, thinkthat the  United Kingdom in securing the &quot;Canadian&quot; rates  is getting  the best ofthe bargain, and,  inasmuch as  our policy  of  enforcing  on the  West Indies anextension of preference in favour  of the United Kingdom  costs money to the west indian  taxpayer, they  not unnaturally   feel   entitled to press  for  more  equaltreatment.    (&amp;.)  The United States gives  a preference to  Porto Rico  amounting to 2 centsper lb., equivalent at present rates of exchange to about 101. per ton, whereas theUnited Kingdom rate (on sugars not exceeding 06o polarization) amounts to 3J.  15s.a  ton.   The effect of American policy  in regard to Porto  Rico  is shown  by  thefollowing figures :                                                               Dollars.         Total value of imports into Porto Rico in 1899 ...        9,805,916         Of which the United  States supplied ...       ...        3,984,369         Total value of imports into Porto Rico in 1920 ...       96,338,534         Of which the United  States supplied ...       ...      90,724,254         Total  exports of Porto Rico in  1899 ...       ...      10,156,541         Total  exports of Porto Rico in  1920 ...       ...     150,811,449The British West Indies cannot help contrasting this development with their own,and draw the inevitable conclusion.    (c.)  The American preference to Cuba is -40 cents a lb.,  i.e., about 21. per  ton,but the  production in  Cuba  amounts to about  3,500,000  tons,  of  which  about1,300,000 tons is surplus over  and above  the amount that can be  absorbed by theAmerican market.   This Cuban production must be sold somewhere, and, as Cubapossesses certain natural advantages unexhausted soil, factories on a larger scale,e,g., capable of dealing Avith 50,000 tons  of sugar per year instead of 7,000  tons orless in the British West Indies, and, above all, very large  investments of Americancapital the West Indian producer fears  that the Cuban surplus will be dumped inspite of the British preference, at rates with which he cannot compete in the  british market.  These fears are at the moment strongly reinforced by the  formation in theUnited States of an  organisation called the  Sugar Export  Corporation for the express  purpose of refining  Cuban  sugar in bond and  of  marketing the refined products in Europe.    (d.) The   possible  competition  of   beet sugar  from countries with  highlydepreciated exchanges,  like Czechoslovakia,  makes  the  outlook for  the produceruncertain.   Against this contingency no relief is obtainable under the  safeguarding of Industries Act.
To meet this position the West indies advance the following request:      That the present rate of preference in the  United Kingdom should be doubled,i.e., increased from one-sixth to one-third over a period of years, preferably equal tothe period of ten years for which  the West Indies are bound  to Canada under  theexisting  arrangement, and  for which  they have  undertaken  to give their  present high rate of preference to British goods, and also  that an undertaking may be given that,  should the sugar  duties be reduced during  that  period,  the substantivepreference on British sugar should not be  allowed to fall below the present figure,namely,  in the  case of 90o test sugar  approximately SI. 15s.  a ton.   I would addparenthetically that representations have  already been made from the West Indiesto the Canadian Government asking that the Canadian preference may be doubled.    So far as the continuity of the principle of preference  is concerned, their viewshave been already met by the undertaking given by His Majesty&apos;s  Government thatpreference at the existing proportion of one-sixth of the duty shall be maintained during the period of the Canada-West Indian  Agreement.    But valuable as is this concession,  it is urged  that it only partly meets the  west indian situation, and that  for the reasons given above the existing preference oflfif per cent, is inadequate  to safeguard  the industry.   Moreover, those concerned are apprehensive  that  the  present  proportionate preference  of  one-sixth mightdiminish to  vanishing point, if there was a substantial reduction in the sugar duties.It is to meet this possibility that they  desire His Majesty&apos;s Government, subject tothe approval of Parliament,  to undertake to  maintain for the period specified aminimum preference of 3/. 15s. per ton.    I would strongly recommend  that, having  regard to the political and economicissues here advanced this request should be favourably considered.    It is impossible that any concession  granted to the sugar industry  should belimited to the West Indies, as  it would  be open to the objection of favouring one partof the Empire as against another, and it is obvious that the  first consequence  which adoubled  preference would entail upon the United Kingdom must be an immediateprospective  loss of  revenue.   If the preference &quot;were  doubled, the loss would amountto say 1,200,000&apos;. on the imports from the British Empire.    On the  other hand, it must be  remembered that the sugar industry more than  anyother in  the West Indies  is carried  on  with capital  invested  from the UnitedKingdom,  which  pays  taxes in the United Kingdom.    If sugar  becomes an uneconomic  proposition,  these estates will go out  of  cultivation,  and the UnitedKingdom will  lose, not merely the capital which,  has been  invested, but also  aconsiderable source of revenue which pays taxation in the  United  Kingdom.    Other tropical products do not require investments of capital  on the same scale.Secondly, the sugar industry in the colonies provides more  employment per acre  andmore  revenue per acre  than  any  other crop.  The effect of closing down  the  sugarestates would be to produce  a state of the gravest  financial embarrassment, and tocreate serious  unemployment in  the colonies,  which are largely,  or in some casesentirely, dependent on the sugar industry.   It is not impossible that their difficulties would be so great that an appeal would be necessary to  the Treasury for a grant-in- aid to enable them  to carry on at all, thus  repeating the unfortunate history of 1897.    At the  present moment the outlook is so uncertain that planters are tending togive up1 sugar and go into other crops,  thus increasing the dependence of the UnitedKingdom upon sugar produced on foreign soils. They are unwilling to-day to  investmoney in new machinery. The only way to ensure orders for such  new machinery inthe United Kingdom, and to secure an Empire-grown supply of sugar, is to show  thatHis Majesty&apos;s  Government  intend to pursue a policy which will  encourage  the industry to look forward to a reasonably assured economic future over a period ofyears.    Finally, it is  right to  remember  that the stability and progress of the West Indies is largely dependent upon  the  presence of a European element.  The  sugar industry is  the means of attracting and maintaining the European population;  it is pre-eminently one which cannot be carried on  without a European staff to organise and direct  the  local labour.  From the political, social, commercial and  Imperial point of view, it is  vital that this element  should be  maintained, and this can only bedone by  preserving the sugar industry in those colonies where it still exists.     One  other objection of substance  remains  to  be -noted.   The  australian government has recently asked for a preference  on raisins and dried fruits,  which
has been refused by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Raisins and dried fruits do notform a product of importance to Australia in any way comparable to the importanceof the sugar  industry  to  the  West Indies and to the British  Empire.  To  someextent also, Australia is interested in sugar.  It is, therefore, not only on economic,but also on political grounds that I would recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould agree to the proposals of the West Indies in this matter. I realise the dangerof demands from other quarters for  an extension  of  preference on other productssuch as cocoa, but it  must  be borne  in mind that when  the preference was firstinitiated,  it was  only sugar producers who pressed for a change  of policy from thepoint of view of assistance to their industry.  In the case of tea, coffee and cocoa, nosuch strong demand existed,  and I do not anticipate difficulties from those quarters.    Even in  the case of the West Indies, the demand for  an increased preferenceon cocoa is not likely to be  urged seeing that so large a proportion of the productioncomes from the British Empire, and preference therefore gives little or no advantage to the  producer.o
