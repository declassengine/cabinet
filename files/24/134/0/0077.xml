GAB I H3 T.                 Copy ITo.   ^                Housing of  the Imperial War Kuseum         memorandum by the  Chancellor of the, -exchequer ;        I desire to support the proposal contained in the memorandum  circulated &quot;by the First Commissioner of Dorics (CP,3848).        It is in my opinion out of the question to abolish the War  Kuseum.  From  80,000 to   90,000 of public money has been spentI  on purchasing items for the collections,  apart from the numerous  and valuable gifts received.  The large collection of modern&quot;  pictures mainly donated &quot;by distinguished artists (Orpen, Sargent,  Lavery, Muirhead Bone and others) has alone recently been valuedI  at  300)000.   The collections of records, photographs r.nd1  models of military and civil activities under the conditions  of the Great War will become increasingly important to studentsi  and no practicable alternative accommodation can be found forI  them;    To abandon tho Museum af ter the money has been spent andI the gifts accepted would  involve a loss of prestige and arousei                                       -I great  resentment.        It is true that the collections need condensing and cur-  tailing and the First Commissioner&apos;s proposal secures this by  compelling a reduction of 60fe in the floor space occupied.        It is not practicable to continue the !&apos;luseum at the Crystal  Pr.lr.ce in view of the extravagant rent and the impossible condi-  tions  there;  nor could I possibly propose to Parliament the great  capital expenditure which would be involved in the erection  of a new building.                                                        It
          It will be seen fron  the First Commissionersmemorandum that the net  reduction  of space which  the  imperial institute has been asked to agree  to is 4,300  square  feet  onlytut  of a total of 153,000 square feet now occupied., that a rentMil be paid and that generally  in arranging details  every efforthas  been made to produce a scheme  which the authorities concerned might be expected to accept without difficulty.          In these circumstances  I strongly recommend  for acceptance the scheme proposed by  the First Commissioner ofWorks, which is the only practicable one whioh has been putforward and the only one which can be carried  through in the  timeMai lab le ,H.S .H,I faSURY CHAMBERS .
