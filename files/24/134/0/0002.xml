SALMON AND FRESHWATER FISHERIES BILL.

C.P.3802. Copy No. 3

Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.

This Bill is substantially the same as the bill (C.P.3057) brought to the notice of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A.C.92, Minute 4) in June last and then approved for introduction. The Bill was accordingly introduced to obtain the criticisms of persons interested with a view to its re-introduction early this session with such amendments as might appear desirable. I pointed out that the Bill had been promised in the King&apos;s Speech in 1920 and that there was a continued and pressing demand for it. Various suggestions from Boards of Conservators, Angling Associations and others have been received, and, so far as possible adopted.

In its present form it is accepted by the other Government Departments concerned and is expected to be found to be substantially an agreed measure.

No public expenditure is involved.

I am anxious that the Bill should be re-introduced at an early date.
