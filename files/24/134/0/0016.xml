Employment in coal-miningremains about the same.  More regular time is being worked.  The slight improve-ment in the steel and iron trade has continued, but there are no signs of a generalresumption.  In shipbuilding and marine engineering no developments are reported.Ship-repairing is still fairly active.  In the cotton industry a slight improvement inthe number of hours worked has taken place.  Woollen industry still continues toimprove  slowly.  There  has been  a temporary  improvement in, the  silk  trade.Employment in  the  hosiery trade  remains good.  General  engineering shows no improvement; the threatened lock-out  overshadows the whole position.  The slightimprovement in the motor and cycle section has been maintained. Building industryshows a very slight improvement, mainly in &quot;house decoration.&quot;  The pottery and china industry shows signs of a revival. Glass  manufacture, however, shows signsof depression.                                      T.  J.  MACNAMARA,                                                  Ministry of Labour,

[From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee,    The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident  in  the  early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at  a meetingof the Cabinet, when the Cabinet  Unemployment Committee was  appointed toconsider the whole question and  devise means for relieving unemployment.    [This Committee has  since been in constant session  and has,  up to the 3rdMarch,  1922, held 42 meetings.    The problem of  unemployment in one form or another has also been before theCabinet on 58 occasions between the  13th August, 1920,  and the 3rd March,  1922.]                        (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was passed into law on the9th August, 1920, and came into operation on  the 8th  November following.   TheAct applied compulsory&apos; insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons ascompared with 4,000,000  previously.   Subsequent amending Acts modified theconditions as regards rates  of benefit and the amount thereof which could be drawn.Contributions  were also  increased and  authority given to borrow money from theTreasury up to  20,000,000.

                 . (B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.    A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of  1.920  and of the latermeasures from autumn 1.921 onwards has been set  out in previous issues of thisReport.   At least 250,000 men have had employment on these  schemes at various times,  and at the present time over 131,000 men are employed,  exclusive of the workprovided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits andTrade  Facilities Act schemes (see table below).    On  the 25th February,  the  Ministry of  Agriculture and  Fisheries issued  a circular  Letter  to  all County Councils  (except the   London  County  Council)authorising an  extension  of the land drainage  scheme to include works for theprovision and improvement  of  water supply to farms.   Schemes, towards the costof which the Ministry are prepared to make a grant of 50 per cent., may be submittedby farm owners through the County Agricultural Committee up to the 31st March,1922, *but they must be such  as may reasonably be expected to be completed by the31st May, 1922.SUMMARY  SHOWING  THE  LABOUR EMPLOYED  AT  FEBRUARY  24,      1922,  ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES  REFERRED  TO  ABOVE.Scheme	Number Employed in Greater London.
