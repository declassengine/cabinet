                            GABIHET, 3843.                         &quot;            PISBalEDING  OJJ1 THE ROYAL  IRISH COHSTAgJLAEY.2/65579 G? &apos;            S&amp;smoxanduifl  from Sir  C.F.JN., JtSaoready to  the                    S^secretary  of State&quot; f or War.&quot;&quot;           I hog to  draw attention to  the unsatisfactory state of    affairs  at the.present  moment in Ireland owing to the delay    in the disbanding of the Royal Irish Constabulary..           In order  to  assist  the Civil Government I have arranged    for a certain number of these men to he aocommodated in    Military Barracks with the troops *   In certain &quot;barracks    there are several hundred  of these men,who have nothing to    do, and are, generally speaking, in a.disturbed state of    mind, owing, I understand, to the delay of the decision in    regard to their pensions,  etc.           Apart from tho fact that  these- men are still drav/ing    full pay, which moans considerable expense to the public,    it is obvious that the retention of a large number of men    in Military Barracks who have nothing to do, and.therefore    spend their time discussing their grievances, is a most    unsatisfactory state of affairs, and  if continued might    give rise to. trouble, in which the troops would be involved     by being called upon to restore order,   &apos;I hope  such a    contingency may not arise, but , I. think- it right to draw    attention to this matter for the. reasons I have set forth    above, and also because it is extremely undesirable to  - r    have men in the state of mind in which the. R.I.C. are at    the present moment asso.ciating with young soldiers.                             (Signed)  C.P.K.MACRi2.iDY,                                          General,                          Commanding-in-Chief the Porees in Ireland,    G.H.Q.. Ireland,         Parkgate. Eublin,             11th&quot;March, 1922..
