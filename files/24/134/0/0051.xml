    [This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    (Printed for the Cabinet.    March 1922.)SECRET,CP. 3851.CIRCULATED  BY  THE LORD  PRIVY  SEAL.                          To Viceroy, Uth March 1922.    Most  urgent.  Private.   Following for Viceroy from Lord Privy Seal.   have seen statement in Press that adjournment is to be  moved  in Legislative assembly to-morrow to discuss Mr. Montagu&apos;s resignation.  The  subject obviously falls withinproviso in section 45 of  Manual of Business allowing  you to disallow motion if it relates to a matter  which is not primarily the  concern  of the  Governor-General inCouncil.    We presume that unless you  see strong reasons to the contrary you will exerciseyour power to disallow.                         From Viceroy, 14th March 1922.    Following for Lord  Privy Seal from  Viceroy.   Your private  telegram of 13thMarch relating  to  the adjournment  to be moved  in Legislative Assembly.   Thereis great agitation in India regarding Mr. Montagu &apos;s resignation.   Forgive  me  if Ispeak frankly  not  my  own views,  but  those  currently represented here in press and among influential  people.   The suggestion is  that, although it  may  be  thatMr. Montagu made a blunder, he has been sacrificed to placate the die-hard element in British politics, and secondly  to mark the change in British sentiment towardsIndia.   These views are elaborated in various   ways, but undoubtedly, save  amongsta considerable  section of the British, many of whom have looked askance  at the reforms,  and  some  very  few  extremist  Indians,  Mr.  iYlontaguV resignation from.office  is viewed  with grave concern.  You, who, were, I believe, responsible for thepolicy  contained iu  first declaration regarding India,  made in August  1917, willunderstand Indian view, as Mr. Montagu is identified with the reforms movement andthe more liberal policy towards India and freer recognition of India&apos;s claims.  Thereis a concensus of opinion that India has  lost a  great friend ; money is being readilysubscribed for  erection of a bust in  the Legislative  Assembly.   Both Houses  to-daywish to discuss his resignation.   I had already considered whether I should disallowa resolution, moving the  adjournment of  the House to call attention to Mr. Montagu&apos;resignation.  I  have been in  communication  with my Home  Member,  who  is the leader  of the  House, and through  him with  the  President of the  Assembly, and Ihave made clear that I could not  permit  discussion if  there was  to be criticism ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government or of the Prime Minister,  or any Minister concerned, orany  animadversions on  the motive  of  the Prime  Minister, or other Ministers, inrelation to Mr.  Montagu&apos;s resignation, or any observations  or suggestions  as  to the successor  to Mr. Montagu.  If, however, all that is intended is to express appreciation of Mr. Montagu&apos;s past services as Secretary of State  and introducer  of  Reforms,  Ithink it will be unwise and  impolitic for me to disallow the motion, and, indeed, itwould be  difficult even within the rules.   Upon receipt of your telegram I sent for my Home Member, who took my instructions practically in the language above  stated,and has now gone  to the Legislature and will  carry the same  instructions to Shah,Member of my Council and Leader of the Council of State.                         To Viceroy, 15th March .1.922.    Private.  Your private  telegram  of  the  14th instant.  Following  from lord privy Seal.    We  are quite satisfied  to accept your decision that there are strong reasons for allowing discussion within the limits laid down by you.     5254   100  3.22                                                   [P.T.O.
    You may like  to  know  that Press and spokesmen of all  parties here unite incondemning publication by Montagu without consulting Cabinet, whilst each  sectionrepeats its former views on general policy.                         From Viceroy, 15i/i March 1922.    Urgent.   Private.   Following from Viceroy for Lord Privy Seal.  The discussionsproceeding in England and reported here in abridged form inclined me to decide thatit was in public interest that  I  should  disallow the resolution to  be proposed  to-day in Council of State,  expressing appreciation of Montagu&apos;s services, but I find that sucha resolution has already been permitted in Bombay and Bengal, and it thus becomespractically impossible  to prevent discussion in all  lndia&apos;s Legislature.  Moreover, onconsultation with Leader of the House  of Assembly I came to the conclusion it woxildbe more harmful  to prohibit  than  to  permit  debate, particularly as it takes  placefirst in Upper House, which is more restrained than the other.   Later a motion will besubmitted by Assembly which I shall  tlien consider by the light of to-clay&apos;s debate.You will also remember the atmosphere of  our Legislature  at the  moment, when wehave tc be as conciliatory as possible whilst Budget discussions are proceeding.INDIA OFFICE,             16th March  1922
