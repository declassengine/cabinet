The principal object of this Bill;(which, was         mentioned in the Klngts Speech) is to substitute.yearly  for&apos;         half-yearly audits in thfe case of certain local authorities-.&apos; &quot;&apos;     2.           The accounts of County. Councils,; Borough Councils j :         Urban District Councils and Parish Councils are made up  and  v-         audited yearly, and strong representations have..been made to         me on behalf of Boards of Guardians and Rural District Councils         that they also should have yearly auditsThey complain that         great inconvenience, loss of time, and expense  are  involved         in preparing their accounts, and in submitting ,t;hem for  audit         twice a year.  - I am satisfied that these complaints are well         -founded, and that.it :is-desirable to substitute.: annual, audits1         in these cases. ..&apos; If: the- change is m&amp;dh for Guardians.: and        , Rural District Councils&apos;it/is ^necessary to-  apply, it; also to         overseers, whose accounts are/closely linked -up-with those .         authorities.,   -     3.           Objection may be raised that there is danger, in .         having less frequent audits.than half-yearly, for the .three         Classes of authorities. -&apos;  My reply is (l) that the  danger &apos;        -has not been apparent in the.case of Urban District Counc iis        : and Parish Councils who have always had. yearly.audits, (2)         that I am taking pov.&apos;er. by the Bill to. direct extraordinary-         audits in any case where this seems necessary,  (3)  that  I antif         taking administrative action which will minimise the risk of         misappropriation of moneys collected on behalf of local         authorities.
4.           The Metropolitan Boards of Guardians and  certain    Metropolitan Joint Poor Law Bodies are excepted  from  the    change to yearly audits, as the-half-yearly equalisation of    Poor Law expenditure under the Metropolitan Common Poor    Fund could nex. be carried out unless half-yearly audits are    retained.5-           Clause- 3 provides a simple method whereby a  Borough    Council can adopt &apos;the system of Government Audit.   At    present out of some -360 Boroughs only 60 are subject  to this    audit.   In the remaining cases the audit is conducted by    auditors appointed by -the Council.   Many Borough  Councils    desire to have Government audit., but -the Statutory enactments    on the subject can only be applied by me&quot;ams -of a local act,    or in rare cases,, by provisional orders   The cost of a local    act usually prevents use of this : procedure.   The re have    been numerous applications from Boroughs for Government    audit, and the proposal in the Bill, whereby a Council which    passes a resolution after suitable -notice can have the    system applied -to their Borough, aeein* the simplest way of    meeting the need.   There should be no objection to the    clause on the part of the Boroughs.* vfts there is  no compulsion    on them to adopt Government audit.                                      .JL.
