Following from Lord Curzon.-     Following for Cabinet,     Two sittings of conference have  &quot;been held to-day,     At morning session I &quot;brought up  the question ofprotection of minorities in Asia Minor with a viewto obtaining adequate  guarantees for  their securityafter evacuation by Greeks,    I received no supportwhatever from French who are quite  indifferent tofate of minorities and regard every question fromstandpoint of how it will be regarded by the Turks.The Italians also were very luke-warm.   NeverthelessI submitted a series of propositions  at the afternoonmeeting which were eventually carried after longdehote.   Their main features are;    (1)  Invitation to League of Nations to assume aspecial responsibility in respect  of  these minoritiesby appointment of local commissioners whose reportsshall be BUomitted annually to assembly of league and:     (2) Specification of areas  in which this form of supervision will be particularly required.   Textfollows by bag.     Report of military authorities sitting underMarshal Foch as to conditions under which contemplated                                           evacuation
evacuation of Asia Minor should be carried outwas then submitted and approved by inter-allied military council being in absolute accord withConstantinople generals.     I then initiated a d is CUBS ion on Armenia andfulfilment of our pledges for creation of seme  formof autonomous existence or national home for Armenians.Here again I was met with complete indifferenceamounting almost to open hostility by French andwith only tepid support by Italians.   TomorrowI propose to submit a series of propositions on thesubject which if accepted will go some way to redeemour national honour although I cannot hope that theywill satisfy Armenian aspirations.     Discussion will then ensue upon the Straits andThrace.
