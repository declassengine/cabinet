[This Document  is the Property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.]    I circulate to my colleagues the following telegram which has beeu received from india regarding the visit of the Prince of Wales.23rd March 1922.         From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 22nd March 1922.     357 S.  Prince of Wales&apos; visit.  Pending receipt of detailed reports from centresvisited  by Prince, I feel it desirable to convey  to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government a  briefgeneral appreciation  of  the  effect of the  tour.  Apart  from activities of extremistminority, who endeavoured in certain centres in British India to boycott the visit and create disturbances, the reception accorded His Royal Highness has everywhere  beenrespectful,  and has evoked  intense  and general enthusiasm.   The personal charmof His  Royal  Highness, and  his democratic  sympathies,  captivated people, and strengthened their traditional loyalty to  the Royal House.  Even in places where the extremist element had been prominent in recent years the masses of the &quot;people threwthemselves whole-heartedly into the general welcome.     The special interest displayed  by  His Royal  Highness, on all occasions, in theArmy in India, was highly appreciated by  the  troops and pensioners, who acclaimedhim  as a friend and comrade.     In  the  Indian States, as was to be expected, enthusiasm was  universal,  and in keeping with the proverbial loyalty of the Princes.  Popular demonstrations in  large cities like Hyderabad and Mysore showed that  people fully shared the loyalty of  theirrulers.   General effect of tlie visit has more than satisfied our  expectations.  It hascon finned the loyalty  of the masses, and demonstrated that the attachment of India tothe throne stands on a foundation which nothing can destroy.     We are deeply grateful to His Royal Highness.Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1922.SECRET. CP. 3883.PEEL.5279100  3.22
