T)CCUMEHT:.IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT AMI 10 IvlaJ3STYlS GOVERNMENT.)REPORT BY TIIE GENEBAh OFFICE COiv;MAKD IIIO . IK.CHIEF. on the.....SITUATION :IU IRELAND FOR ^TEEK ENDING4th MARCH, Jig22,    (Circulated by the Secretary of State for War.)     During the past week the following Units have left ireland for Stations in Great Britain:-   Tho Carobiniers and 1st Royal     In Limerick.a curious situation has developed.   Some 10days ago,  owing to the unreliability of the local units of theI-.-K.A., the Provisional Government decided to  send down a party of their own forces to take over the Police Barracks on evacua-t;&apos;.cn by the R, 1,0.   This was done without any untoward eventoccurring,,.   At the end of last wo ok, however, considerable.bodies of armed men,- presumably belonging to the Anti-Treatysection of the I,R,-A.-.,. marched into Limerick and commandeereda number of Hotels there, and placed the individuals who havebeen carrying on Liaison work under arrest.    Reinforcements.with Armoured Cars have been sent to Limerick  by the ProvisionaGovernment, and up to date no armed conflict has resultedbetween the rival  factions.   Unfortunately we still have 2battalions in Limerick, but the Officer Commanding&apos;,there iswatching the situation carefully, and every step is being takento ensure that His MajestyTs troops do not become Involved.  Itis hoped to withdraw these two battalions early next week.     In County Tipporary the so-called 2nd Southern DivisionI.R.A. is practically completely out of hand,  and none of theI.R.A. there appear &quot;to acknowledge tho authority of theProvisional Government. -  Three unfortunate conflicts betweenthe * Republicans and the R.I.C.., involving the  loss of atleast one life,  and of &amp; very large number of  arms have takenplace during the process of withdrawal of the  latter.     Some weeks ago instructions were sent to  the 0,0*0, 6th*Division to do everything in his power to assist in the with-drawal of any isolated R*.&apos;I.C. detachments, and to ensure thatthe withdrawal was carried out without interference.   In thearea Counties Cork and Kerry, which at that time appeared, tobo the most disturbed, the withdrawal on Cork  was carried outsatisfactorily.   Most unfortunately the Divisional Commissionoof Clonmol was of the opinion that no military assistan.ee wasnecessary to aid him in hi&amp; withdrawal,   It was a-pity that  .at least th&apos;.: surplus arras were not handed in to the militaryauthorities, rather than leaving them with small isolateddetachments of R.I.C.-  -     Since these events In Tipperary tho Civil Government have-asked for military assistance in concentration of the R .3C .C&apos;v:&apos;-in Loinster, and the troops of the 5th.Division are now. dailyassisting to bring in those detachments,.  &apos; Unfortunately, it- is too, late to give any assistance in Conuaught as all the /troops have already been withdrawn /from that area.;  yesterday a policebarracks at Woddlawrr, County Calway, -was successfully raided byrebels.C A B I HE T.&quot;** ct ^ r\ i;
      In Dublin isolated\ou^rages-have taken place, one of which-Avas&apos;-oorriod. out on the old pre-truco linos.   A Hd. Constable of the R..I..C was brutally murdered in . the northern part of Dublin City.   Mr.. Max- 3-reen.,&apos; -tho -Ohairman of tho Prisons Board was shot dead in Stephen&apos;s Green an P.riday/3rd March, while attempting to stop the escape of an arced robber * -  Tho only satisfactory point in connection&apos;with this appalling-crime,-was-that the chase of the murderers was at onoe taken up aot only by-the D..M.--P..., and Provisional Government&apos;s Police.,but: by the general public, as well A young constable of the .D.M.p. was shot at In the neighbourhood of Inchicore yesterday, /apparently, for no reason beyond., the fact that he was wearing uniform, but fortunately his wound is not serious.      The situation on the border between IJorthern and Southern Ireland. remains the same&quot;.   The representative of the Provisional Government attached to the Commission maintains that.raids&apos;will occur into the Northern territory unless the prisoners now hold by the Northern Government are released.   There is apparently no..likolihood of raids from the Northern into the Southern-.,-territory unless the Southerners make provocative raids on the North&apos;,  in which case rataliation is quite possible.      It is doubtful if this Liaison Commission is serving any useful purpose, as neither tho Northern nor Provisional Govern- ment seem to place much value on&apos; its existence,&apos; and certainly the Provisional.Government do nothing to assist it. -  I have approach- od the Provisional Government through the Under-Secretary -on this subject, and have suggested the advisability of appointing-as their representative -some individual with -&quot;sufficient authority to control Hogan (the commander of their forces- in the County Monaghan) in place &quot;of Dr. -Viard who is&apos; one &quot;of the members of Hogan&apos;; staff.   At the sane time I fool -sure that no satisfactory, result will bo achieved, and that no one with sufficient authority to insist on tho &quot;orders of the Provisional -government being; carried out, will be appointed until the matter is&quot; taken up and strongly pressed by the Secretary of Stata for the Colonies. -   &apos;    In Belfast during the -week-end trouble has broken out . again and a considerable number of casualties have been inflicted.. It is impossible ;as -a&apos; rule-;in - these &quot;--conditions to &quot;ascertain which side have, initiated-the troubles&apos;.-   Shooting breaks out spas- modi daily in certain parts of tho city and.-it -is seldom possible to, ascertain which side fired first, : - /&apos;  - -The strength of the Military.forces In Ireland-has been- considerably-reduced during the- past week owing to large drafts of time expired men   amounting, in all to some 2,500 having left the - country.    Although small drafts have begun to arrive&apos;from the Depots this has but little ef fact&quot; in --making&apos; good- the, wastage., j In one case I hive already had to ask for drifts to.be sent over from the Depot prior to the completion of the -20 weeks training, and I - quite anticipate that-similar demands will have to,,.be made  1 in case of many other battalions,   The number of duty men in most battalions is;ridiculously -small.  .                       .      Two Naval Launches which had been-.locate?] near Limerick for the  last 6 months have been successfully withdrawn across Ireland through the Grand Canal during the past week..   These launches together with a destroyer are, I understand from the AdmiralCommander-in-chief, &quot;Western Approaches,., to bo sent to Carlingford jLough.to. -assist in maintaining peace between Northern and Southern]                                                         &apos;-Ireland/i
Ireland,    I have arranged far the establishment of coramunieatioiibetween those Hnval forces and the nearest detachments of troops,but I .think that I should have.been informed of the poire/ under-lying, this action by the Admiralty beforehand so that propersteps could have been taken to ensure co-operation if neeessaria,(Sgd)   C-.
