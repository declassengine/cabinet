(J (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;&apos;S&quot; GOVERNMENT)                            GJ. BINE T.iOM^IENTIAL.!,P. 5820.              COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS,             &apos; &quot;&apos;r\                 OXFORD AND ST.ALBANS WINE PRIVILEGES.                              (BIIL)Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to             the Treasury.          The object of the Bill is to abolish the privileges with regard to the wine duties at present heldby the Corporations of St,Albans and Oxford,   the privileges of both Corporations are of very long standing and preclude the levy of ordinary licence duties in thetwo cities.   The abolition will result in increasedrevenue and eliminate the existing anomalies as regardslicences in these two cities.          In each case an agreement h*s been made withthe owners of the privilege, one of whom  (St^Albans)started the question of approaching the Treasury with aview to the abolition of its privilege.          In 1913 and 1914, preliminary steps were takento pass an Act extinguishing the privileges  of these &apos;two cities, but the Bill was dropped In 1914 and couldnot be pursued during the war.   The Corporation of st,Albans raised the question  again in the Spring of lastyear.          The total sums received under  the  OxfordCharters are at the present time,  139 a  year.   precise information as to the yield of the St,Albans  licences Isnot known but is thought to bo about  63  a year*
                 The original commutation money offered to       Oxford and accepted by the Oxford Corporation was  4,000       and to St.Albans-was  1,500,   But in view of the present       price of money the Treasury have not thought it proper       to offer such large sums now, and St.Albans has agreed       to accept  1,200 and Oxford  3)200 (together with costs       incurred in connection with the Bill) for the surrender             i               ...       of their privileges.-                 The case for the Bill ia:-                    -(a) that the owners are willing, and St.Al.bans                        actually anxious to surrender their privilege                    (b) the revenue to be gained by the transaction;                    (c) that it is very desirable that the excise                        and licensing laws should be of universal                        application;                    (d) that it is also desirable that licenses                        should be obtained from the Justices in all                        cases and not from nondescript authorities..                 Trie Bill is a &quot;hybrid&quot; Bill i.e, it will go to       a Private Bill Committee after second reading..   It will       afterwards have to come before a Committee of whole House       as it imposes a charge on the Exchequer and a Financial       Resolution will be necessary.                 The Standing Orders relative to Private Bills       have been duly complied with.                                    (Signed)&apos;  HILTON YOUNG.Treasury, S.7t.       8th March, 1922.
