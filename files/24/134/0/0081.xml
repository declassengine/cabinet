Tho Communists are making every effort to &quot;extend the battle front&quot;, but, on the whole, the looked-out engineersshow little disposition to ally themselves with the organisedunemployed.     The Communist Policy Conference has ratified the&quot;Decisions of the Third Oongraaa of the Communist International&quot;and the Party is, in consequence, openly pledged to a policyof violence and sedition.

On March 13th the wholly unemployed on the live      registers totalled approximately 1^7928399 as oornpared with      1,811,543 cn March 6th, a decrease ef 19,144 in the week      and of over 142,000 in the last nine woak3;  short time      workers on March 13th numbered approximately 242,000 and on      March 11th 135,760 men were employed on relief v/orks,           Reports from the provinces indicate growing      restlessness among the -unemployed which may possibly find      vent in disturbances in a few districts.           A copy of the manifesto&apos; issued  by the national      Administrative Council of Unemployed in conneotion with      G-uardians and Parliamentary elections has ccme into my      possession.

The Chiof Constable of Salford informs me that the moderate unemployed have petitioned the mayor to remove the communists from the Albion.

      Oastle Street and after speeches had heen made about 300      men marched to the Labour Exchange to receive the reply      regarding an application for increased scales of relief;      on the same day about 500 people attended a meeting at      Wallace Statue while a deputation interviewed tlie Parish      Council.  On Maroh 15th about 100 people again collected      at the Labour Exchange hut the majority soon dispersed to      attend a football match:  there was no disorder at these      meetings.             The Chief Constable of Edinburgh states that several      unemployed meetings have been hold in his area: on      March 13th about 800 were addressed on the engineering      lock-out and a small section marched to Synod Hall of      whioh they intended to take possession.  The presence of      the police frustrated the intentions of the unemployed      who then marched to the Mound where the Police were in      possession of the steps.  The following day another      meeting was held and on March 17th the unemployed marched      through the city:  at one stage the police were obliged      to draw their truncheons but did not charge,THE BByOIiUTI ON &amp; RY ASPECT CP THE MCtCTSERIIS DISPUTE,            Reports, from ,the chief industrial centres Bhom no      weakening on the part of the members of .the Amalgamated      Engineering Union, al&apos;though, picketing in many places is?      only, half-hearted.

Raiding parties are, however, j     in process  cf formation and it is probable that factories     where non-unionist engineers are employed will be selected     as the scene of operations.THE COMMUNISTS.           On March 18th and 19th about 160  delegates attended     the Policy Conference of the Communist  P&amp;rty in the St. P     Town Ball:   practically all the agitators who are, or     consider themselves to be, of importance in  the movement&apos;     present and this fact accounts for  a temporary suspension     of their activities in the provinces.   The  conference wai      something  0f a landmark in the  history of craimunism in      this  country in that it ratified the &quot;Decisions  of the      Ihird Congress  of  the  Third Intoraati onal&quot;:  the Party was     previously pound, to  accept these theses,  hut                                                             ,4     tneir ratifiction definitely commits  It  to a policy     of sedition end vlalenco.  The &quot;Decisions&quot;,  to which     reference has been  4(??.d  e in previous  reports, were  seoretlj                                                  issued/
 issued  to  branches  in January last in book form:   a copy of the  book  i3 in the possession  of. the  &quot;Daily Expross&quot;,&quot;which published  extracts  on  March 21st&quot;,                                      i     In order to give effect to  tho &quot;Decisions&quot; the conference appointed  a &quot;Commission&quot; of which the  terms of reference  were given  in my last report:   an effort on the part&apos;of the  Executive to  appoint  tho. members of this body was frustrated by the group of &quot;Intellectuals&quot;&apos;who had succeeded in &quot;rigging&quot; tho conference&apos;by means of  proxy delegates: pending tho  findings&quot; of this Commission,  it is possible that only  the comparatively ifcojocuous theses,  such  as those relating to  the  work  among women  and in  trade unions,  will be applied.      The  Electoral and Industrial&apos;policies of the P-arty, outlined in  reports 145 and  137 were ratified as  was the thesis  on the &quot;United-Front&quot;:the questionnaire  sent to  the Communist  P.rty  by  the Labour Perty is quoted in  another  part of this report.        The conference  provided yet another proof  of the dictatorship of the  officials -  with the  one exception  of the personnel composing the  Commission:  my informant reports that during  the  discussion of the &quot;mass  party&quot; the delegates displayed , acute, ignorance of the  terms used&quot; and for an hour tho proceedings  were  quite beyond  them,     . The  one black spot  in  the red orgy of words  was the absence of any allusion by   MacManus... to  financial  help from moscow:  the delegates commented  with  pmoh alarm  on the o-mission  as it  had been  common talk in. the  branches that  hewas to  bring back sufficient money to  make&apos; the party a happyhunting ground for  paid agitators.      Another significant omission was [the  absence of aresolution on unemployment;   Holt however  said that he waswel^L satisfied with the general attitude of the Party, whioh                                                        has tof  course been  responsible for the exlatenoe  of therevolutionary Kvclonal Administrative Council of Unemployed.

-4 1 1. X00MMJNIST8 AND THE LABOUR PARTY     The following&apos; is a copy of the questionnaire  sent  bythe Labour Party to the Communist  Party and  of the repliesof the latter organisation,  which  has decided once more to seek affillation:-     &quot;Question 1.          Tho Constitution of the  Labour Party emphasises     the fact that the object of that Party  ia the     achievement pf &quot;the political, social and economic     emancipation&apos;of the people by means of Parliamentary     Democracy&apos;..                     -          The application of August Last of  4;he Communist     Party for affiliation to the  Labour Party set out&apos;     explicitly the adhesion of the Communist Party to  the     Soviet system (which is understood as  being incompatible   .&apos; with Parliamentary Demo crapy) and the  adhesion ox  that     &quot;Party to the Third International (which ia understood     as acceptance of the Theses and Regulations of tho     Third International, many of which are  regarded as     inconsistent with the Constitution and  objects of     the Labour Party).          Enquiry is made as to what changes, if any, have     been.made in the constitution and objects of the     Communist Party on-these points,. so as  to conform  to     the constitution and objects of the Labour Party.     Renly to Question 1.          We are unable to trace in the constitution of the    &quot;Labour Party the statement, quoted in the questionnaire.     as to the object of that party being &quot;the political,     social and.-economic emancipation of the people by  means    . of Parliamentary Democracy&apos;  (The quotation marks  as     in questionnaire).          On the-&apos; other&apos; hand., we entirely agree with clause     (d) of section 3 of the Party constitution under Party     Objects.   &apos;To secure for the producers by hand or by     brain, the -full fruits &apos; of their Industry, and the     most equitable distribution thereof that,may be     possible, &quot;upon the basis of the conrnon ownership of     the means of production and. the best obtainable&quot; system     of popular administration and control of each     industry or service.&apos;          In reply to your enquiry, no change has been  made     in the constitution and objects of the  Communist Party     since application for affiliation to the Labour Party   .  was first made.          The Communist Party still adheres  to the Soviet     system and to. affiliation to the Communist Internationa.&quot;     which, as correctly stated in the questionnaire, is     understood to mean acceptance&apos; of the Theses and     Statutes of the Communist International.          The Communist Party, however, does not understand                                                 adhesion/
adhesion to the principle of the Soviet system tormean non-participation in parliamentary action.   Itregards the Soviet system as the system which mustsupersede parliamentary democracy after the comingpower of the workers.   In the meantime the CommunistParty proposes to use the opportunity provided byparliament for advancing that struggle towards thecommon owners hi -p of the means of production which is so clearly proclaimed as the object of the LabourParty itself in its own constitution.Question II                            *     It is a fundamental principle of the LabourParty to confine its operations to lawful means; andit has never given any encouragement to the^ idea of attempting to secure the powers of Government bymeans contrary to the law of the land for the timebeing.             0     In view of the acceptance by the. CommunistParty of the Theses and Regulations of the ThirdInternational, enquiry is made as to whether theCommunist Party, by its constitution and theresolutions of Its convention, lays down anythinginconsistent with the position of the Labour Partyin this respect.Reply t o Quest ion II              * ,     Y/o find nothing in the Constitution to bear outthe view that the Labour Party will never under any circumstances contemplate extra legal action for the attainment of its declared objects..  It Is true  that-under normal circumstances its policy is to confineitself to purely legal activities;  the same applies to the Coirrnunist Party.     Any discussion, however, on the. use of otherthan lawful means to obtain a political end must obviously bo of a theoretical nature.  The,circumstances of any given time of-crisis must andWill determine the form.en agitation will take.   thus the Labour Party Executive participated in the actionof the Leeds Workers1&apos; and Soldiers1  CouncilConference of 1917, and :in August 1920 w&amp;3 forcedunder, the threat of the country being landed intoimminent - war to advise a. &quot;down toolsr policy whichthe government would, certainly have proclaimedunlawful had the threat been put into operation.Moreover,  the Tdown tools1  policy then adviseddirectly contravened the first principle ofParliamentary Democracy which insists, that publicdiscontent with Governmental policy shall findexpression only through the recognised machineryof the ballot box.     If, as appears to be the&apos; case,  it is argued that acceptance of the Theses and Regulations ofthe Communist International is incompatible withaffiliation to the Labour Party because action                                            outside/
 outside  the  law&apos;is  endorsed  therein,  we  would respect fully-subuit that, this  objection  clearly applies  to a body already within the  Labour Party. That body is affiliated to the Vienna (common!j; called the  -^ International).    We  quote from  tho Theses on c methods?  ond  organisation of the  clsss strugglev,&apos;. adeptre  at  the Vienna Conference, February 22nd,, 192Z&quot;,  at Fh.v;.h the Idol&apos;,  was represented by its chairman and others. Clause 4 .     .      Only in these  countries where  the capitalist  class does not command the power required,  and in particular is bereft of military  power, and therefore  cannot venture  to replace  the  fight of political democracy by open civil war,  only in such countries will the working class be a&quot;hle  to gain  political  power  by means of democracy. Clause^ J5j^      But where the  capitalist  class is strong  erough to maintain  by violent means its rr0.e against  the revolting masses of the working people it will break democracy, keep control of tho means of  coercion and challenge the working  class  to an open fight.   In this fight it will  not be the  vote  that  will decide the battle but the  economic  and military strength of the&apos; opposing classes.  In these  circumstances the&apos; working class, will  be  able to  become, the ruling power only by direct action  of the masses (mass strikes, armed rebellion,  etc)  and it will have to maintain its power by suppressing the conquered capitalist class.                 &apos;          .      There is nothing  in the Theses and  Regulations of the Communist International.more.definitely - 1outside the,law than this.     Yet the I.L*P.&apos;remains affiliated to-the Labour Party while the Communist Party is refused admission.. Question III      Tho Labour Party,  by its  Constitution  and its practice, excludes  the idea.of members of Parliament whom it  supports - being under.the specific pledges  as to their action .iir Parliament,  which might  conflict: with undertakings given  publicly  to their constituencies; and&apos; still.more their being under obligation to any other party,  or section of. a party,  either  to. resign their seats  in Parliament&apos; when called  upon,  or otherwise.,     . In  view of the, definite instructions of the Third International,, and  pesoJtu*ioad-.-of the  Communist Party c-onvoutionsy. enquiry Is made as  to whether  the  Communist Party has any policy, and  if so, what  with  regard  to pledges  ipiJ  obligations  of Members of  Parliament piyi^ivi-vA by  the Co/rcnunist Party. .Answer/
Answer to Question III     The clause in the constitution of the CommunistParty governing pledges and obligations of members ofParliament insists that all members of the Partystanding for election for Parliament or a localadministrative body must agree to subordinate allother considerations to those of the Communist party and must be prepared to sign a specially drafted form to this effect&apos;.   Compare the corresponding clause in the Constitution of the LLP. which reads asfollows:          &quot;Each candidate must undertake that he will     run his election in accordance with the  principle     and policy of the Party, and that, if elected,     he will support the Party on all questions coming     within the scope of the principles of the LLP.1     Tlie Communist Party expects no greater latitudein this direction than is allowed the other constituentsections cf the Labour Party.Question IV     Having regard to various declarations inpublications of tho Communist Party, and numerouspublic statements by prominent members of that Party,to the effect that 1their antagonism to the LabourParty could best be waged within its own camp1 andthat the object with which affiliation to the LabourParty was sought was tho weakening, if not tho actualdestruction of that Party, enquiry is made whether&apos;the Communist Party, in renewing its application foraffiliation, proposes and intends to become a loyalconstituent of the Labour pi-rty, conforming at all points with its constitution and working for the promotion of. its objects.Answer to Question IV.     The answer to this, question is that the CommunistParty, in the event of affiliation, intends to conform to the constitution of the Labour Party, withoutprejudice to its rights of criticism on policy ortactics, in common with all affiliated bodies.  Itdoes not and cannot pledge itself that it will not seek to change &quot;policy and tactics in its own directionThe right to do this is Inherent, and, as a matter of fact, is constantly exercised by other organisations.-    . We protest against the use made of statementsattributed to members of the Communist Party.  these have been interpreted as attacks upon the LabourParty when the meaning clearly conveyed was that cfantagonism  to pa particular attitudes adopted by somespokesmen of the Labour Party.    . The Communist Party does not disguise itsopposition to much of the policy and many of the statements made by these spokesmen, but claims the   jsame right to express its dissent within the ranks of-the Labour Party as is, in fact, constantly exercised by other and more  moderate sections of that Party.&quot;Branches/
     Branches of the Communist Party have heen requestedto furnish immediate replies to the four following questions:     (1)  Has your branch sought affiliation to the  local          -  Labour Burty?    &apos; (2)  Has your branch been refused affiliation?     (3)  What wore the reasons for refusing your branch            affiliation?     (4)  If the local Labour Party has granted your             branch affiliation, how does it stand with             the E.C. of the Labour Party?&quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;     On Maroh 18th the &quot;Daily Herald1&apos; admitted that  it was approaching the end of its tether.   George Lansbury(chairman).  Prank Hodges (vice-chairman), Alfred Barnes,Gerald Gould, W.C Robinson, Ben Turner and Robert Williams(directors)  and Philip Millwood (secretary) announced  that:          &quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&apos; has come to tho greatest     crisis in its history.  Everything now depends  on the     next three or four weeks.          &quot;These few weeks will decide whether the paper     is to be saved for-good or lost for good; whether all     the money:, all the effort, all the loyalty and     devotion and self-secrifice of the innumerable  rank     and file supporters of the Movement and the paper     throughout the country are to end in acknowledged     failure or to go forward to a sure triumph.&quot;     A large type heading urged readers to &quot;keep the workersTonly daily alive&quot; and the appeal- over the above signaturesrequested every section of the Trades Union Congress tounito in sharing the financial responsibility necessary toenstxre the paper&apos;s continuance.     It .seems fairly clear that the orthodox labour  movementassumed financial responsibility for the paper for. atemporary period in the belief that a general election was imminent and now finds it impossible to carry the weeklyloss.                                                 On/
         On Maroh 21st Lansbury anno unco a  that  112 had come in    as donations,  25- as a second debenture and that  60 was    due from Huddersfield,  as well as other small sums:  he    addes &quot;my experiences this week were  extraordinary&quot; hut    ^    &quot;It is true  we have not secured millions of readers.&quot;         The &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&quot;, an organ of the Independent    Labour Party, appeared for the last time on March 18th  -  owing to financial difficulties.IRISH RCVOLUTIOHARY ACTIVITIES IH THL DuITBD KIPGDOH         Luring the week there has been a ^certain liveliness&quot;    in Sinn Pein circles in  Great Britain duo to the tactics    of Art 0&apos;Brien and his band of de Valera^tes  who are   &apos; trying to swing the Irish belt-Determination League in the  &apos;, direction of extreme Republicanism.         P.J. Kelly, the President, who has long been jealous    of 0-,Brien&quot;iB power and influence in the Councils of the    League, has now come out definitely for the Treaty and is    trying to smash 0&apos;Brien.  0&apos;Brien controls the machinery    of the League at the Headquarters in London but Kelly, a    Liverpool man, has influence in the North, where most of    the branches are.   .The latter has been busy during the    week visiting branches and addressing meetings along the    -Tyneside.         As already reported Art 0TBrien and his London friends    succeeded in carrying an anti-Treaty resolution at the    Leeds Executive Meeting on the 5th March, which is recommons    for adoption at the Annual Conference of Branches to be held    in London on the 1st April.&apos;   P. J. Kelly now accuses 0&apos;Briea   : of trickery and evidently intends to  fight.         Those who know Kelly say he is jt;st as ardent a  /-Republican as-0TBrien 5 but he thinks the present a good    opportunity tc oust 0&apos;.;ritn&apos; altogether from the control                                                            Of/
!of tho organisation in this country.    We may therefore look forward to interesting developments at tho Conference.     Some of the paid officers of the League are known tohe ardent Republicans, but others have carefully refrained from committing themselves on the one side or the other.They wish to be found on tho side that offers the bestopportunity for gaining an easy livelihood.     It has now been ascertained that J.L. Soanlon, referredto in a previous report as being engaged in the collectionof arras, etc, in the Manchester district, has two, addresses,one at 32, Tipping Street, Ardwiok, Manchester, where aMrs. Lucy McC-lyn carries on the business of a dressmaker,and the other at 10, Grove Street, Ardwiok Green.   He issaid to be forwarding part of his supplies to Prank Carty,a de Valera1its Irish Republican Army Commandant in sligo.The Manchester Police are enquiring about him.     Local Irish Republican Brotherhood meetings are being held at 252, Lower Broughton Road, Salford, address ofone James Mallon, where de Valera is said to have stayedwhile &quot;on the run.&quot;     Within the last few months de Valera4s scouts havevisited Manchester and the other towns of the north on morethan one occasion, to ascertain the amount of support his policy is likely to receive.     Joseph Vyse, who is still in Ireland, has told his friends in Scotland that he is no longer Commander ofthe Scottish Brigade, Irish Republican Army, ,but has beenrelegated to the position of organiser.
