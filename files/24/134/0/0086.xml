    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                   (Printed for the Cabinet.    March 1922.)SECRET. CP. 38S7.    I circulate to my colleagues further telegrams regarding the Indian Budget.                                                                        PEEL.    28th March  1922.                         From Viceroy, 21st March 1922.    Private and  personal.  In the Assembly to-clay an amendment to reduce theimport duty from 15 per cent, as proposed in Government scheme on imported piece-goods to II per cent, was  carried, that is, the  duty on these articles  remains as lastyear and will not be increased  by present Budget.  The  excise duty on cotton hadalready been rejected.   We came to the conclusion that  if the Assembly meant  to vote in considerable number for  reduction to 11 per cent, it would  be advisable  toallow it  to happen, and  Hailey,  for  Government, approved proposal in Assembly.You will understand there was not time to consult  you.   I hope you will approve  ofthis course although we shall lose 140 lakhs in revenue, but I thought  it would be helpful  at home in view of unemployment,  and also  here,  in  that  it  will savecertification of cotton  excise duty.  I am  sending this hurriedly on  message fromHailey at  Assembly.  We shall  send  official telegram  giving full  information this evening.               From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 22nd March 1922.    Private and  personal.  Your private and personal telegram of 21st March.  may i understand that items of cotton excise duty and cotton import, duty are all that youintend to give way upon ?  That  is, can  I  assume  that you  intend  to  restore other items, including  full increases proposed under salt and machinery and imposition ofpetroleum excise, in so far  as these may be rejected?  On above assumption deficitwill apparently stand  at  about 5 crores (figure postulated in my official telegram ofFriday  last)  after  allowing  for. probable  excess  expenditure on  Waziristan and allocation to ge neral revenues of profits from. Paper Currency.    Is it your view that the concession as regards cotton  will  enable  you to secureyour  remaining  proposals  by consent?  I  need not repeat  serious objections  toadoption of Budget involving large deficit even if its passage involves recourse to your reserve powers.     In case it may  help you I am sending you officially summary of leading article into-day&apos;s Times regarding possible reactions  of iutransigeaut  attitude of Assemblytowards Budget.                From  Viceroy, Finance Department, 21st March 1922.     Legislative  Assembly have rejected by a large majority increase of salt tax and increase of cotton excise.   It has also reduced increase of import duty on piece-goods from 15 to 11 per cent.   All speakers made it clear that this latter  step must not betaken  as evidence  that India in  any way admits  contention  that import duty and cotton excise  must be increased  or reduced pari passu, or as limiting in  any wayIndia&apos;s fiscal freedom, but was  dictated solely in the  interests  of consumer, and because high prices of cotton cloth  during past year or two have pressed with greathardship on  poorer classes.  Amendment to  reimpose  duty on  silver  has been defeated.  It is probable  that increase in tax on machinery will be  opposed by non-official members  unanimously.  Case of kerosene is more doubtful.  Discussion is still proceeding, and we will report result to-morrow.     From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Finance  Department,  22nd  March 1922.     1260. -Budget.  Following are extracts from leader in to-day&apos;s Times :                            The  Political Crisis in India.     Crisis which has arisen cannot be said to be wholly due to conduct of contumaciouscharacter  on  part  of  unofficial  members of  Assembly.   In Budget of close upon     5278   100  3.23                                                       A
                                       o100,000,000/-. over 40  per cent, represents military expenditure.   Although  heavymilitary charges partly arise from increased cost of food and other commodities, ArmyFstimates have  been swollen by unwise attempt to occupy Central Wazinstall&apos;,     When unofficial Indian members of Legislative Assembly protest against crushingburden of taxation for military purposes, they have  many  sympathisers outside theirown ranks.     Where they have gone wrong is in methods  of protest.   Debarred by  recent decision of Law Officers  of Crown from directly discussing military expenditure orvoting upon it, they have adopted expedient of wholesale refusal to vote supplies forother purposes. They began with 5 per cent, reduction  of various civil estimates,but their real opportunity came when they were asked to  vote new taxation to meetheavy deficit.   They  declined  to double salt tax.  They refused to increase  exciseduty upon cotton goods.   Yesterday they voted against increasing  import duty uponcotton  goods,  with evident desire of enlisting  sympathy  of  Lancashire in  theircrusade against military  expenditure.   For  moment they have  almost  broughtAdministration to  a  standstill.   But they have also done  something  which theyevidently do not yet realise, because they have probably made it necessary for GreatBritain to recousidcr whole working of constitutional reforms in India.     Governor-General in  Council  can,  if  he thinks  fit,   take  steps  to  make  goodfinancial deficit which Assembly refuses to repair;  but if he  does sc  constitutional reforms will be wrecked within little more  than a year of  inauguration.  We do not.see  how an Assembly which flatly decliues  to vote supplies can  long  continue inexistence.     While by no means  without sympathy with objections  raised, to India&apos;s  enormousoutlay on defence, we  deeply regret that Indian unofficial members have  forced soperplexing  a  crisis.  Their   action  is more deplorable   because it  comes  at  atime when  evidence  is  accumulating  that  Provincial  Legislative   Assemblies,especially Bengal  Assembly, are not fulfilling expectations.  When every  allowance is made  for India&apos;s   lack of  experience  of  Parliamentary institutions  ....conclusion is still almost  inevitable  that  neither at  Delhi  nor in  the  provinces arenew institutions proving  as successful as  was hoped.  It is  therefore  necessary topoint  out that grant of  constitutional  reforms  now  on trial  was  by no  meansunconditional.   In famous announcement made in  the House of Commons on 20thAugust  1917,  to  which we  gave our warmest support,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentclearly declared that  &quot; they must be guided by co-operation received from those uponwhom new opportunities of service will  thus  be  conferred, and by extent to whichit is found that confidence  can be reposed  in their sense  of responsibility.&quot;   TheHome Government promised progressive advancement if  experiment had favourableresults ; but there is  evident implication of possibly reverse steps  if Indians do not co-operate in  fulfilment of new  duties  and responsibilities.  Both in Delhi and inprovinces Indians seem to be  casting  new reforms  into melting-pot ;  and they mustnot be surprised if their present attitude leads very soon to examination of whole problem from new angle.      From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Finance Department, 2&apos;6rd March 1922.     Only  official telegram received since my clear the line telegram of 17th Marchhas  been your official telegram  of 21st March reporting rejection of  salt tax and increase in cotton excise and  import  duties  on cotton goods.   I  gather from  Press.that your anticipation  that increased duty on machinery would be rejected has provedcorrect.   In these circumstances I am much, concerned at statement in telegram into-day&apos;s Times that Finance Bill was passed by Legislative Assembly on  22nd Marchleaving  uncovered  deficit of  9 crores.   I  do not understand  how this estimate  is.arrived  at and shall be -glad of  detailed information on the matter, indicating yourestimate of loss of revenue under each tax  rejected.  Having regard to the terms ofmy  telegram of the 17th March  I feel that Times message  must be based on some misunderstanding, as  my  telegram  definitely  postulated  that  main scheme of yourBudget should not be undermined, as  would be  the case  if all modifications in your proposals above referred  to are allowed to stand.  True deficit would in such a case
amuch exceed figure  of  5 crores desiderated  in  my telegram of 17th March, and my instructions regarding use of your reserve powers would  therefore become operative.From this point of view I am unable  to  understand the figure of 9 crores given bythe Times, as on the information received from you I should have expected the total tobe greater.  The Times adds:  &quot;It  is improbable that  the Government will use  its powers for the restoration of the rejected  proposals.&quot;   Presumably this is merely the forecast of their correspondent, but on the other hand my expectation, based on theview  taken  here of  Government  of  India Act, G7is, was that you  would recommend the Bill in its final  form before  the motion that it be passed was proposed in theAssembly.   It would have been  helpful  if you could have kept  me more  fully andpromptly apprised of course of debate and action you propose to take in the light ofmy telegram of 1.7th March.    Please send full report clear the line on above matters  as soon  as possible.               From Viceroy, Finance Department, 23rd March ] 022.    Following is  in continuation of our  telegram dated 21st March, No.  886 V.Finance Bill.  Discussion continued  until yesterday  evening, and following further-changes  have   been made.  Increase  of  import  duties on machinery  deleted.Operation of section 13 (3) Indian  Paper Currency  Act suspended till 31st March1923.  Duty on kerosene has been  passed.  Net result of discussion  has been  toreduce taxation  by 950 lakhs, countervailed to the extent of 303 lakhs by amendmentof Indian Paper Currency Aot.   Motion to pass the Bill was carried unanimously, butprotests were made  from various  sections  of  Assembly against present scale ofexpenditure, and  demand was  made to Government that deficit should  be covered byretrenchment.                         From Viceroy,  2Uh March 1922.    Private and personal.  Your &quot; clear the line&quot;  private and  personal of the 22ndMarch.  I have  come to definite  conclusions in my own  mind, subject, of  course, toany views that  you wish  to  urge  and  to  a  meeting  of my  Executive Councilto-morrow.  You must not assume that I intend to restore the other items of machinery and salt duty ; indeed, my view is that it  would,  be  unwise for me to take such action.The present position is that petroleum excise has  been accepted  by the LegislativeAssembly, cotton  excise has been  rejected,  increase on import duty on piece-goodsalso rejected.  Machinery increase from 21- per cent, found so little favour that wecould not  ourselves press for support in the Assembly.  Salt tax the Assembly wouldnot hear of.   The  proposal was  carried, which has been discussed between us, relatingto paper currency, and this reduces  deficit by 3  crores  net result at present, and the approximate figure, after making allowance for the  3 crores from  paper currencyproposal, is a deficit of  9  crores instead of 2f- crores.   This is, of course, serious, andI view  a  deficit of this magnitude  with much apprehension;  but the situation hasbeen  put before the country and before  the  Legislature, and  with  their eyes openthey have chosen to  reject part  of our taxation proposals.   If I restore these proposalsmy action would have a very serious  effect upon the  reforms, and I. cannot imagine  aworse tax for the first exercise of the Viceroy&apos;s powers of restoration than the salt tax,traditionally unpopular, politically falling largely upon the very poor, and capable of gross misrepresentation by agitators to masses.   When the proposal  was introduced in my Executive Council, T said then, very reluctantly, I would support it in order toraise  the money, but that I disliked imposing the  tax, and that I should be  againstrestoring it if the  Assembly threw it out.   We tried it with the Assembly and failed.I could not contemplate  this exercise by me, for the first time in the history of the reforms, of the statutory powers vested in me to override the  action of the Indian Legisla- -tore  again on the  machinery tax.  1 am against  the exercise of  my powers to restore.The  feeling against the increase is very strong in the Legislature  and. country.Several members, including myself, were very  loath to agree  to  the  increased tax,because it would check industrial development so necessary to India.  At first, in  my council, we.only increased from 2  to 5 per cent., although the proposal was made byone Member,  and rejected, of  increasing to  10 per cent. Subsequently,  after theSecretary of State&apos;? telegram, I, with others, reluctantly agreed.  Now the&apos;LegislativeAssembly  has objected  altogether toV the  increase.   Y&apos;ou will  remember that, inWorthington-Evans&apos; telegram of the 20th March, he was of opinion we might wellgive  way on  the machinery  tax;  indeed,  we could not help doing so.  There  is      5278                                                                 A 2
nothing therefore, so far as I can see, which i should certify.  It  would amount tocertification merely of salt tax.    Apart from other considerations which 1 have referred to above, I fear that, if Irestore, it would be taken as almost sounding the death-knell of the reforms.  Thereis already serious  anxiety as to whether or not His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to pursue the policy declared  in August  1917, and  represented in  Government of india act, 1919.  A definite statement upon this subject would be most useful  at this moment, especially from you, as the new Secretary of State, and the absence of it will increase apprehension.    I have read summary you sent of the  Times article.   It scarcely takes sufficientlyinto account that the members of the Assembly are debarred from voting  on themilitary expenditure, and that it is largely because of  this restriction that  the set wasmade against military  expenditure.  It has found its practical manifestation in therefusaf  to vote the taxation required.   The Military  Budget represents some 53 percent, of the total  Budget  of the  Central Government without regard  to provincialBudgets.    Official telegram will  be sent to you upon  the  whole  position showing theexpenditure cut down by the Assembly, and the exact effect of the taxation refused.The Council of State Avill  deal with  the Bill to-morrow, but it  is not  at  presentanticipated that any change will be made.              From Secretary of State to  Viceroy, Finance Department,                                 21th March 1922.    1292.   Viceroy.  Your telegram dated 23rd March.    Budget.   Please inform mewith least possible delay of exact present position of Budget, namely     (a)  Deficit in Budget as it left Legislative Assembly and how calculated.    (6)  Your  intentions or  any  commitments   in  regard to  rejected  taxes  and           percentage cuts in expenditure.    I am  at present mainly  dependent  for information on Times  newspaper, andam much  concerned as to  possible position, which  I desire to consider  on  receiptof your reply.               From Viceroy, Finance Department, 20th March 1922.    Your telegram of the 23rd March, 1274.  Budget.  You will have now receivedour telegram of the 23rd March, No. 1905, giving the final result of the debates  inthe Assembly,  which were,  contrary to  our expectations, continued till 22nd andterminated late that clay.   As result of  voting in Assembly position stood as follows(figures are in lakhs):     (1) Taxation  proposed  by  us   reduced   by  200  cotton   excise,  430  salt,185 machinery, 141 import duty piece-goods, total 956.    (2) On the other hand suspension of  paper currency provision improves revenueposition coming year by 302.    (3) Refund of  taxation collected from 1 st  March will probably have to  be  paidnext month amounting to 80.    (4) Reductions made  in vote for suppfies  amount  to  95.   We have  not yetdecided how far we shall be able to accept these. We  anticipate that, under certain of the individual demands affected, it will be difficult, if  not impossible,  to carry on with the  reduced  grant(s).  On the other hand, it is possible that we can  managewith the reduced  amount  under other head and may even be able to make further reductions).  On  the whole, we have decided  not to make any definite restorationunder   any head  at present  stage, but shall  consider  whole  matter  at  earliest opportunity.    (5) Net result  is to leave uncovered deficit of 916.    2. When we   received your  telegram of  the 17th  March,  1197,  budget,  we regarded it, as indication of your  desire that we should, if possible, attempt  to workto deficit of not more than four or five crores, and failed  to  read  in  the  concludingsentence(s) of  your para. No. 2 and opening sentence(s) of your  para. No. 6 a desireto  convey, through us to Governor-General, an instruction that he should, in certaincontingency, use the powers reserved to  him by section 67 (6) of Act.   We  do notconsider this a suitable occasion  to discuss constitutional questions whether  suchinstructions are within tenour of the Government of  India Act, but you will allow us
                                        oto say we should  have expected that, if it were intention to convey such instructionsthey  would have been couched in precise form, and directed  to  Governor-Generalpersonally, rather than in course of telegram addressed to Government of India.     3. This will explain why we have not previously dealt with two passages of yourtelegram to which we have  referred.   Had  we read  them  in the  sense which yourtelegram  dated 23rd  instant seems to  indicate, we should not, of course, have failedto take up  the  matter  at  once with  you.   We  have now received your  telegramNo. 1205 of 24th instant, and regret that you should have felt hampered owing to anylack of fulness in the  information supplied by us, or to any delay in its reaching you.We must point out, however, that pressure of public business has been so great that it was-quite impossible for us to guarantee that information would not reach you earlier throughnewspaper channels.   The  sittings of  Legislature have continuously occupied time ofour officers day by day, and frequently till very late in the evening.   We ourselves have endeavoured to  keep you very fully informed of  progress of discussion, and in ourtelegrams of 16th and 17th instant made a special point of sending you. beforehand an appreciation, so far as we could then form one, of probable attitude which the assembly would take.  From the general tone of your telegrams we doubt if  it is fully realisedby you how vast  is the difference of the present conditions  in Legislature from thosewhich existed before Reforms.  Existence of large non-official  majority, together withconstantly changing current of opinion amongst  members, make it impossible  for usto keep you in complete touch with developments which may  arise at short notice and  render it imperative  for us to  arrive  at immediate decision  without  previous consultation with you.     4. We  understand that the Governor-General has already addressed you, and is again addressing you  regarding the  reasons which decided him not to make formalrecommendations to Council of State to pass Bill  in a form restoring some, or all, ofthe  items of taxation refused by  Assembly.   We  desire,  however, to  take this opportunity of informing you that before finally arriving at this decision,  Governor-General consulted us  on the matter.  We unanimously advised him  that the course he proposed to take  was  the proper  one.  The use  by  Governor-General  of  extra-ordinary powers conferred  on him, personally, by  the Act, should, in any case, be onlyresorted to on the occasion of such grave over-riding (? emergency) as to override veryserious results which must follow from such action.  In the present  case there wouldbe no question of certifying the increase in lax on machinery or having regard to the decrease made in the proposed import duty on cotton piece goods the proposed increasein cotton excise.  There remained therefore only  the proposed doubling of  salt duty.To restore that piece of taxation by action which, although provided for by law, would be widely regarded  throughout India as  an arbitrary executive act  taken with  referenceto a  tax which is, rightly or wrongly, regarded with great sentimental dislike, would,we must frankly  say, haAre been in our opinion most unwise and  would have increased substantially the task of governing India.  There might  have been a stronger case for  certification  of the  doubled salt  duty if, against the  political agitation  whichwould have been aroused,  there could  have been set  off the great advantage whichwould have followed  from  our being  able  to publish the report of Military  Require-ments Committee,  or to indicate that we were  taking in &quot;hand  some  real and notillusory scheme of Indianising the army.  Our inability to malting such announcementrendered it,  we consider, inadvisable for the Governor-General to impose, by his ownpersonal act, the  extra salt duty.      5. Failing such action&apos; by Governor-General, we presented Bill  as passed  byAssembly to Council  of State  and did not seek to insert amendments in that Councilrestoring those items.  It is certain  that amendments, even if carried in  Council ofState, would have been rejected again by Assembly.      We may add that your telegram of the 23rd March reached us too late to affect our action in this respect,  as Bill was  already being considered in Council  of Statewhen telegram was received.   Bill was considered and passed by Council of State in yesterday&apos;s meeting.   You will see from report  of debate  that Government  speaker did  not minimise serious difficulties created  by existence of an uncovered deficit over nine coDres.                          From  Viceroy, 25th March  1922.      Private and personal.   Your official, telegram of  (? 23rd) on Budget reached  me this afternoon.  The Council of State  was actually passing the Finance Bill as it had
emerged from Legislative  Assembly.   Official telegram  in answer follows.   I  ampersonally very concerned  about your statement that  your telegram of 17th Marchcontained instructions  to  me.  Had I so regarded  it 1  should  immediately havecommunicated with you.   I  did  regard  it as expression of  strong opinion,  but  i thought you realised the difficulties we were in respecting  the whole Budget and thatwe were bound to come to decisions, during course  of  debate in the Assembly,  whichwould give no time for  consultation with you.   I am not sure that situation has been quite appreciated by you.   We have laboured to get  Budget passed notwithstanding the objections and criticisms, and  without  having recourse to the Goveruor-Gencrarspowers of restoration upon his certificate that  the  safety, tranquillity or interests ofIndia made it essential  to  pass  the Bill as recommended by the Governor-General.There are serious  technical difficulties regarding the procedure,  and particularlyhaving relation to  procedure in both Houses, which I shall elaborate at a future date.It is obvious I could not recommend  Bill in the Legislative Assembly unless we  had at the outset adopted the decision to insist on all proposals of  taxation, and withoutalternatively (corrupt group) Bill.     Result of our deliberation on legal position was that I could not recommend thatthe Bill be passed in a particular (? omission) until  it got to the Council of State,  andif I had so recommended to the Assembly it would,  in the opinion of those conversantwith the views of  the Assembly, have resulted in a complete block of Budget proposals.Having regard to the difficulties of the situation I thought we were doing on  thewhole not so badly to get Bill through leaving deficit of 9 crores.   Although westrongly (corrupt group)  dislike  this amount of deficit  it  was better to get  Billimposing the rest of the new  taxation.   The  Council of State  passed it  withoutalteration in one  day.  Thus, although we have not got our full proposals, we haveavoided constitutional (corrupt group).  The current of opinion  in the Legislature hasbeen  constantly  changing, and we  could not feel sure of the action that  would  botaken.  I sent you  private and  personal telegrams informing you as soon as I knew what  was happening.   The official telegrams are sent by  my Financial Departmentwho have the precise information.   Both Hailey,  the Finance Member, and Cook, theSecretary of the Financial Department, have had a most trying time, and 1 cannot butthink have conducted the debates with great ability.  Neither of them regarded yourtelegram of the 17th instant as containing instructions.  It was  addressed to Viceroy,Financial Department.  The certifying must be done by the Governor-General, not bythe Governor-General  in  Council.  I consulted  all the members  of my Executive-Council, who were and are of opinion  that it was most undesirable for me to certify.    Your reference to observation  in  the Times that it was improbable that Govern-ment  will  use its  powers to  restore  rejected  proposals, must be  the  opinion ofcorrespondent.  I have enquired, and find that no correspondent of  the Times was atDelhi during the  whole  discussion, and there has  been no  communication with  Timesby any member of the Government.  Presumably, this is the expressed view of some-member of the Assembly.    Telegrams both from me and my Financial  Department will have crossed yourtelegram of 23rd,  and all information is now before  you.    My private and personal telegram of the  23rd was sent under impression thatdebate in Council  of State would continue, and the Bill would  not be passed in one    There is little use, at the  moment, in discussing the position of  the Secretary ofState,  in relation to the  Governor-GeneraTs  obligation in certain  eventualities to-certify  under 67n,  Government of  India Act.   This is a point  which  must  beelucidated, namely, whether under the  Statute  the Governor-General can be ordered by the Secretary of State to  use a discretion  vested in the  Governor-General ina particular way.   I have learnt  to-day that there is a Despatch just received which hasa bearing on this  matter.  I shall study it, and communicate with you upon it later.     As 1 have already told you, question of certifying could only affect salt tax, as I hadreceived your view that we could give way on  machinery.  I have sent you this  fulltelegram as I am much disturbed that there should have been,  any misunderstandingat the outset between you and me.    You will have gathered that,my private and  personal of 23rd  instant was sent to-you in ignorance  of  the fact that you intended yours  of 17th March to be  regardedas instructions to me.
