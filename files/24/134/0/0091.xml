I wish to support the Memoranda of the first commissioner of i/orka and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(0.P.3646, and CP.3677) on the housing cf the Imperial Warmuseum in part of the Imperial Institute,)   I was a .&apos;Se-nberof the Committee set up by the Cabinet to investigate thissubject.   The Committee went very fully into the question and it appeared clear to the majority that the scheme whichit was proposed to carry cut would not take any material &apos;space from the Imperial Institute and that by a re-concentra-tion of their exhibits there would be room not only for thepresent but even for further exhibits.   In many ways the .;Imperial Institute has ceased to fulfil the function forwhich it was first established, as so many of the Dominionshave put up their own buildings,, in which they havemagnificent exhibitions of their&apos; products - far better than-any they have in the Imperial Institute itself and far  .more useful tc the general public, as their own buildings are situated not in Kensington but In the centre of Town*  :           There is no reason why the research wc&apos;rk cfthe Imperial Institute, which has a certain value, should bein the least interfered with.   On the other hand, the ideaof the housing of two great Imperial representations,namely, the Peace resources and War record of the Empire,under one roof, should in reality appeal to the Dominions                      - 1 -Till B DOCUMENT 1L5 THE PROPBRTI CP Hla, bRlTAllMIQ MAJESTY&apos;S OuVt%UU3ffi*
and to the Empire if properly presented;  and in this connectionI would point out that by the Act establishing the imperial war jjuueeum the High Commissioners cf the  Dominions are trustees of the iOiseuuH          The Crystal Palaoe was never meant as the permanenthome for the War museum.   The Cabinet will remember that aCommittee of Ministers was set up a considerable time ago who reported in favour of a building for the  imeeum being erectedon the South side of the Thanes.   In the present state ofnational finance it would obviously be impossible to ask parliament to vote money for such a purpose;  but seme otherplaoe must be found both on the ground of economy andsuitability other than  the Crystal Palace..  I might say Iwas much impressed, as  Chairman of the Executive Committee,ofthe museum with  the unsuitabillty of the Crystal Palace.There the exhibits suffer with the great, variations oftemperature;  it is impossible for valuable small exhibits tobe shewn, as they cannot be guarded from theft, the reef is so little rain-tight that in bad weather exhibits have tobe covered With  sheets  of tarpaulin in order to preventdamage from the  Water.   When I was First Commissioner of.Works I endeavoured, by examining many schemes put forward tofind another suitable building for the War Museum, but nonesuitable could be found at that time.   The present first commissioner of  Works has evidently come to the sameconclusion after further investigation.          I would like  to re-emphaaise the contention of theFirst Commissioner of Works as to the large burden borneby the Exchequer for the Imperial Institute, amounting in                        - 2 -
all to about  25,000 per annum, or three times aa much thetotal contributions pf the Government s\poaimcn.  I do notthink anybody could, say . that we get value for our money..          The. Colonial Secretary, in his Memorandum, raisesa question of ..rent being paid to the Imperial Institute forthat this would be an unreasonable proposal to accept; butas.,&apos;the. amount :-df; spaoe to be occupied is a very smallfraction of . that ..occupied by the Imperial Institute, and asP..-think; the bringing of the..war Museum to the Institute wouldcf itself lead to many more people visiting both, thereby being a great advantage to what is now an almost deserted exhibitionwhich on ordinary oooa.si.oris reveals galleries with very fewvisitors; such rent should be kept at a very moderate scale,,the.space t&quot; be,occupied for the War Museum.,  I do not think
