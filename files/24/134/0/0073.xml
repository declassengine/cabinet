[This Document is the Property of Kis*Bntanmc Majestys Government]                  Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1922.SECRET. ,-                                                                cCP. 3873.                                                                %MEMORANDUM  ON  THE  PRESENT  POSITION  OF  THE  IMPERIAL               GOVERNMENT  IN  NORTHERN  IRELAND.  PREPARED FOR THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF  IRELAND COMMITTEE BY THE                         TECHNICAL SUB-COMMITTEE.    IN this Memorandum it is proposed to consider the principles upon which theTreaty was based in the light of developments which have since taken place.  It was clearly agreed with Mr. Griffith that if Northern Ireland declined to enter the IrishFree State, her position was to remain as created by the Government of Ireland Act,1920, without alteration.  Her  powers, privileges and revenues were to be no greaterand no  less than they  would have been under that Act.   The understanding wasexplicit, for the  Government of Northern Ireland had formally demanded in their letter of the 11th November an equality of  status with the Irish Free State, and&quot;the transfer of reserved services.&quot;   There was  no secrecy in the understanding,which was notified to the Government of Northern Ireland  in the letter of the 5thDecember, under cover of which the Treaty was conveyed to Sir James Craig.    &apos;: You will observe,&quot; wrote the Prime Minister in that letter, &quot; that  there aretwo alternatives between which the Government of Northern Ireland is invited to choose.  Under the first, retaining all her existing powers, she will enter  the IrishFree State with such additional guarantees as may be arranged in Conference.  Underthe second  alternative, she will still retain her present powers, but in respect of all matters not already delegated to her will share  the rights and obligations of GreatBritain.&quot;    The reserved powers are thus to be administered by the British Government, inthe Parliament of which Northern Ireland continues  to be represented.  Of thosereserved powers,  the most important are Imperial and Foreign relations and military control.    Ten days later this position was reasserted in  a private correspondence between sir James Craig and Mr. Chamberlain. On the 15th December Sir James  wrote :         &quot; I now find myself in the position of having to decide upon a  course of    action which will be to the best interest of Ulster, Great Britain and the Empire.    That course of action will depend entirely upon  assurances from the British    Government on several most vital points : ,        &quot;I. In  the event of the Boundary Commission finding that an area shall be    excluded from Northern Ireland and incorporated in the Irish Free State, and    the Loyalists within that area &apos;refusing to owe allegiance to the Irish Free State,    will the British  Government, against their reiterated  pledges,  Use, troops to   compel them to do so ?        &quot; 2. In the event of the British Government maintaining its determination   not to coerce the people of Ulster, will they withdraw  entirely from the  area   concerned and allow  the Government of Northern Ireland  to  stand by the   Loyalists in resisting coercion by the Irish Free State ?        &quot;3. As  the  Government permitted  the Sinn Feiners to organise &apos;and arm   themselves during the truce, whilst Ulster loyally acquiesced in the Government&apos;s   plans to take no  action in that direction, will the Government permit Ulster to   arm herself forthwith for  the purpose of protection against the Sinn Feiners,   now so well armed and organised \        &quot; 4. What attitude will the British Government adopt if the Government of   Northern Ireland find it necessary to call upon their friends and supporters,   more especially the members of the Loyal Orange Institution, to come to their   assistance by means of arms, ammunition and money from Great Britain, the-     [8074]
     Dominions and other parts of the world, where people of Ulster descent are in     strength and desirous of helping ?         &quot;5. In the event of the British Government being unable to modify the     Treaty, although they find no difficulty in tearing up an Act, and being unable     to give satisfaction regarding these most momentous questions, and the people of     Ulster taking the matter into their own hands in order to prevent any Act being     placed on the Statute Book which would  prejudice  their  position as citizens     within the Empire, will the British Government withdraw  all  troops and allow     us to fight it out ourselves ?         &quot; Par from feeling that I have exaggerated the situation, I believe that     civil war is not [sic\ necessarily the only end to which we have to look forward     under the terms of the Treaty.   So intense is local feeling  at the moment, that     my colleagues and I may be swept off our feet, and, contemporaneously with the     functioning of the Treaty, the Loyalists may declare independence on their own     behalf, seize  the  Customs and  other Government Departments and set  up  an     authority of their own.  Many already believe that violence  is the only language     understood by Mr. Lloyd George and his Ministers.&quot;     The following passage occurs in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s reply to this letter :          &quot; An answer to the remaining  four questions is contained in what I have     already said. If Northern Ireland remains a part of Great Britain, the British     Government will be responsible for the maintenance and control of all military     forces which  may be needed to support the  civil authority in Northern Ireland,     as in all other parts of the British Isles within its  jurisdiction.   The British     Government will  not permit the organisation of military  forces by any other     authority.         &quot; I do not comment on the last two paragraphs of your letter,  for I know     that you yourself desire peace,  and I cannot believe that men  whose loyalty is     their paide are contemplating acts of war against the King.&quot;     The position  as defined  in these documents is clear.   Northern Ireland was to remain a part of the United Kingdom,  with a Provincial Government of its own to which the control of police had been  delegated just as under their respective charters it has been delegated to the  Corporations of Liverpool,  Glasgow and Birmingham. In view of the disturbed conditions of Northern Ireland, it would  be reasonable to suppose that  its Government would require a  regular police force equipped with firearms and  larger in proportion to the population than would.,  be needed for  a community of commensurate size and area in Great Britain.  It would  naturally be supported  by special constables,  to  be called out in  case of emergency.  But such constables would not be equipped with firearms.  It is a clear principle that a situa- tion with which regular police armed with rifles and supported by special constables armed with batons are unable to deal, is one which calls for the intervention of the military forces of the State;  when a Government enrolls, drills and arms with rifles large numbers of specials, the distinction between  military and civil control has broken down.     If Northern Ireland remains a part of the United Kingdom, the boundary which divides it from the&apos; Irish Free State is the boundary  of the United Kingdom.  The duty of protecting that border from violation manifestly rests on  the forces controlled by the United Kingdom, if the principles enunciated in the letters above quoted are to be observed.   The position  in this case is  all the clearer because  the  boundary is subject to revision in the course of the year.  The duty of handing  over to  Northern I reiand for incorporation in the United Kingdom any areas detached from the Irish Free State, and of handing over to the Irish Free State any areas detached from the United Kingdom, is one which clearly rests  on the United Kingdom in terms of the Treaty. It must also be held in mind that now for the first time  in the history of the British Commonwealth, a Dominion is separated from the United Kingdom by a land frontier only.   That either of the two Irish Governments may lose its head and advance its forces into the territory of the other is a possibility  which cannot  be. ignored.  To  prevent an invasion of Southern Ireland is a duty which rests on the military forces of the  United  Kingdom.   To  prevent  an invasion of  the United Kingdom from Southern Ireland is also a duty which rests on those forces.     In any case,  it is time  to consider how far  the administrative arrangements made in Northern Ireland conform to the obligations contracted when the Treaty
was made.   The troops available in Ulster for the discharge of the military obliga-tions  reserved to the British Government are about 5,000.    Of these,  part areemployed on semi-police work in the riotous area of Belfast.  Others  are posted notnearer than 5 miles behind the border, to act in support of the forces controlled by theGovernment of Northern Ireland, which hold or patrol it.    It is necessary to enumerate these forces.  At the moment of writing  there are3,000  Royal Irish Constabulary due for disbandment.   But Sir James Craig nowdesires to keep them enrolled for the  present.    These  are  backed  by a force of4,346  A Specials, armed like the Royal  Irish Constabulary with rifles, and paid to devote their whole time  to the work.   The Government of Northern Ireland has just budgeted for 1,000 more of  these A Specials.   Behind these forces  some20,000 B Specials have been enrolled, a large number  of  which are continuouslyemployed on police duly.  Of these, since the raid into Northern Ireland, 15,000 havebeen  armed with rifles, and the local Government is  demanding  arms for theremaining  5,000.   A ship  is ready in a British port  loaded with arms, for the delivery  of which   the  Government  of  Northern  Ireland  are pressing.   TheB  Specials  are  scattered throughout  the  six  counties  in  their own homes, but arrangements have just been  made,  at the  instance of our own military authorities,for their more efficient organisation under trained officers.   Behind the B Specialsagain is a third corps of C Specials who are allowed to retain and carry on duty armspossessed by themselves.    The whole  of  these Specials  are  Protestants, if  only  for the  reason thatCatholics are averse  to taking the oath of allegiance.    The maintenance of this organisation by the Government of  Northern ireland has been rendered possible by special arrangements  under which the cost incurredup  to the 30th September, 1922, up to a maximum of  1,480,000, will be borne bythe British  Exchequer.   In effect, the Government of Northern Ireland can at this moment put into the  field a force of at least 20,000, armed with rifles, over and abovethe Royal Irish Constabulary.  The British Government has armed  and is paying for tli-it  force, but without question the Government of  Northern Ireland controlsit.  Its organisation has just been entrusted to Sir Henry Wilson, till a few weeks ago Chief of the Imperial  General Staff at the British  War Office, who, by virtueof his rank as Field-Marshal, draws the  full pay appertaining to that rank from theBritish Exchequer.    In this connection, it is impossible to  ignore the threats contained in the letterof Sir James Craig,  which is quoted above.  Those threats have just been repeatedby him in a speech to his own Parliament:  &quot; I wrote on the 6th February:  &apos; Wecannot consent to any  alteration of  our  boundary except  by mutual  agreement,failing which, in respect of any territory in dispute, the boundary to stand as defined in Government of Ireland Act, 1920.    &quot; &apos; Sir, by that we stand, no matter what the consequences.&apos; &quot;    In the face of language like this, it is impossible to assume that the formidableforces now being organised under the guise of police are  directed solely against thedanger of invasion from the South.   The British  Government has armed and ispaying for forces which, it- is told by the  Government which controls them, will incertain eventualities  be turned against itself.  If Ulster does not accept the award cfthe Boundary Commission  the  British Government will either  have to  pour inoverwhelming forces  and engage on a civil war of the most hateful kind, or else be accused in the presence of the civilised world of connivance with Ulster in creating a position which nullifies the most vital provisions of the Treaty.    It is difficult to  avoid the conclusion that the  Government of Northern ireland has succeeded in assuming the military functions specifically reserved to the BritishGovernment, simply by calling their  forces  &quot;police,&quot;   An  equivalent force ofpolice in Great  Britain  would  amount  to at  least  800,000, or  in  Germany1,300,000 men.   What  would France  say if Great Britain  allowed Germany.tomaintain well over a million &quot; police &quot; armed with rifles?    It is necessary to consider why  the border is occupied by the forces of  NorthernIreland and not &quot;by those  of  the  British  Government.  When the ProvisionalGovernment had been duly installed, the  British Government was entitled to presumethat the Boundary of Northern  Ireland would  be respected  by  the  South,  whoserepresentatives as direct parties to the Treaty had recognised the  right of  NorthernIreland to a separate existence.   But when once the border had  been violated andhostages were seized  and abducted by forces in the South, precautions had  obviouslytc? be  taken by someone.   The  Government of Northern Ireland were entitled to
occupy the border by any forces they could muster for the purpose, until the BritishGovernment was able  to provide the protection  against invasion which  citizens ofthe United Kingdom have a right to  claim.   But  this occupation has shown thatthe border is  also liable to be violated from  the North, for a  fort at Balleek justinside Southern territory has been occupied and is.being  held  by Northern Polite.Phis  is at the critical point where  a neck  scarcely five miles in width connectsDonegal with the rest  of Southern Ireland.    If Northern Ireland is part of the United  Kingdom, the  British Governmenthas a dual responsibility in respect of the Southern border.    It has not only toprotect its own citizens from  invasion, but also to restrain them from any violation of the territory beyond its own jurisdiction.    Until the border is held by  forces  under the direct control  of  the BritishGovernment, it is not  in a position to  discharge  either of these duties.  Occupationof the border by British troops will tend to  stabilise the whole  position.  TheProvisional Government, intent on evacuation, will  be slow to connive at any attackon  British Posts ;  for  such attack   will not  only justify,-  but  compel a  greatreinforcement of  the  British Army in Ireland and will in fact be an  open andincontrovertible repudiation of the Treaty.    On the  other hand, such  occupationwill do more  than anything  to stabilise the position in  Southern Ireland.    the ulster-Government, and also the Northern forces, will be slow to take any measureswhich have to be opened by an attack on British  troops.  Southern Ireland will feelthat .this is so, and the Provisional Government  will then be able to concentrate  itsattention  on restoring order in the South and West.  As it is,  the attention of thatGovernment is riveted on the Ulster  Frontier, and will be riveted1 further  by theostentatious operations of Sir Henry Wilson.*    If things are left to drift, an explosion on the frontier, leading to open war between large forces,  may be expected  at any &quot;moment.    It  is  a case in whiclipreventive measures can be taken in  advance which are  infinitely less  costly and difficult than the measures which will have to be taken in the event of civil war.    The situation is  one  which can  be  rectified if dealt with in time.   In  theabsence of any  deliberate policy or effective measures on the  part of the BritishGovernment  to keep  the border  intact, it  is  difficult  to  impute  blame  to  theGovernment of Northern Ireland.  The first step is surely to inform Ulster that GreatBritain guarantees  the border against raid,  and will take the measures necessaryfor the;purpose.   No  better reason could be wanted for taking over the defence ofthe border.  In these days of motor  traffic,  effective raids for hostages  cannot  bemade if the roads are held.   General  Cameron estimates that 5,000 men  are amplysufficient  for this  purpose, though, of course, additional troops would be needed insupport. .    The British Government has also to administer the border as a Customs frontier.This is another unanswerable reason  why the British Government should assumecontrol of the border.    The measures necessary for  gradually confining the functions of the NorthernGovernment to genuine police work, and  reducing its forces to a type  and strengthcommensurate with these duties, require a fuller consideration than can be  given within the scope of this Memorandum.  such measures can be planned and. initiatedif the Government should decide that they are needed to reconcile its policy to theengagements contracted under the Treaty.    The Government has the  means of enforcing those decisions provided they are taken at once, becauserit can still withhold  payment of the funds upon  which theGovernment of Northern Ireland is relying for  the equipment of its forces.  Butif once those  funds are paid without first securing the necessary guarantees,  theposition will- have passed beyond control.   We shall have then  reverted  to  thesituation of 1914, with this difference,  that the British Government will have armed and paid  for the forces  in Ulster which  are  pledged in certain events to resist  its authority.
