I;shall he  glad&apos;ifthey will givo it &quot;their earnest attention  as Ipropose to&apos;bring the matter before  the Cabinet atan early date,                          (Intel.) &apos;TS.S.C.  .&quot;Colonial Office, SflVT.,      7th &apos;?arch, 1922*.
                             Cabin Hill.i                                Knock,                                  Belfast-^                                     ULSTER,                                 11 arch 6th, 1922,My dear Churchill,        I have now had an opportunity of discussingpersonally with the Secretary of State for war the subjectok the &quot;cuts&quot; it is proposed to malce in tho Battalions in ulster, and I am greatly exercised to learn that tho RoyalI*ish Fusiliers are to bo permanently struck cut of thoArmy List.  Over and abcvo which disaster it appears to becontemplated that two further Battalions should be sacrificed,   You, perhaps hotter than anyone else- are aware of the difficulties of my position and of my manyanxieties..  These will be greatly aggravated if one battalion of the Royal Ulster Rifles and ono Battalion cfthe Royal Enniskillon Fusiliers &quot;re  also sacrificed,  Iwould ask ycu to take this very Important question beforetho Cabinet end emphasise that Ulster s&amp;uld be allowed atleast four battalions of Infantry, in view of the fact thatshe pays her contribution towards the upkeep of the Navy,Army and Air Fcrco*   Recruiting for four BattalionsI can premise you will always be up to full strength,especially in view of the loss cf the Royal IrishFusiliersf which will.throw that&apos;recruiting area open tothe otherSo      The cutting down from six to two is indefensible,as nc such drastic action has been taken . In any part ofthe United Kingdom (to which, we still belong) I hope theCabinet will take the view that I should be assisted in amatter of this kind and that the difficulties of the                                      situation
situation in Ulster should not be increased by denuding our depots, and perpetrating what will be considered a slur upon the people who will consider that they are being classed with the South and West, who  are only too delighted to get rid of their connect on with Great Britain.

This is a matter for immediate action and I sincerely hope that you will be able to carry the cabinet with you in seeing that Ulster is left with four battalions instead of two. Both are fine Regiments.

Sir Laming Worthington-Evans himself suggested that this was a matter for Cabinet decision, and that possibly the view might be adopted that these two battalions might be spared the Geddes&apos; cut.

Your sincerely,

(Sgd) James Craig.

The Right Honouroble Winston S.Churchill. M.P., Secretary of State,

Colonial Office, S.W.
