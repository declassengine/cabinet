               --&quot;7&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;. -., ... :3 Governments               CIRCULATED TO THE  CABINET.     Memorandum of an interview between  LordjCurzon and ttissuf Kemal Bey,  1,  carIton House           Terrace,  March 18th 1922.     &quot;flissuf Kemal Bey remarked that at the previous meeting in speaking of the fundamental principles ofpeace Lord Curzon had dwelt upon the safeguarding of minorities.   The Angora government was strongly infavour of a solution that would satisfy world opinion and ensure tranquillity in its own country. &apos;  They were ready to accept the idea of an exchange of popula-tions between the Greeks in Asia Minor and the Moslemsin Greece.   There had indeed been an agreement ofthis nature before the war.   The Angora governmentwas also ready to accept all the arrangements al-ready made by other powers in other treaties of peacefor the protection of minorities.   His government had further made a new vilayet law which allowed eachvilayet a large measure of freedom in the administra,-tion of their own local affairs.   This should besufficient and should satisfy everyone, if acted uponwith mutual goodwill.     As to the Armenians, the relations of his govern-ment with that of Armenia were friendly.   Two treatieshad been -Concluded between them, those of Alexandro-pol and Kars.   The first had been the result of war,hut not the second which was made between two friendlycountries.   This treaty had solved the principlequestions between them.   All the efforts of his gov-ernment were bent towards eliminating enmity between                                             Armenians
Armenians and Moslems.    Normal  relations  between these should thus be ensured.    If  more were  attemptedit would only create hostility between Moslems  andChristians.     Lord Curzon said that His Excellency  had spoken of an exchange of populations.    No doubt  somethingwas possible in this direction but  it was  not a com-plete solution.    The populations in question were too large.   The Greek population in Asia  Minor wassomewhere near half a million.    For physical reasonssuch a large number could not be entirely  transportedand for agricultural and commercial reasons many ofthem would be unwilling to go.    The same  would applyto the Moslem population in Greece.   With all  the goodwill in the world such a measure could not  be acomplete solution, though it might assist.     He had been glad to hear His Excellency  speak of the friendly sentiments of the National Assemblytowards the Armenians.   He looked forward however to a more precise demonstration of those  sentimentsthan His Excellency had given to-day.   The Armeniansin the South were so afraid of the rule  of Angorathat when Cilicia was evacuated they ran away inthousands and took ship rather than remain.   TheAngora government had therefore not succeeded in persuading the Armenians of its friendship and pro-tection.   In the North, His Excellency had spoken of the treaties of Alexandropol and Kars.    the armenians had been turned out of the North-Easternvilayets and driven back on territory belonging toErivan, a small Armenian state under Soviet influence.                                               When
When Bekir Sami Bey had been here last  year,  one  ofthe conditions of a satisfactory settlement had beenthat the Turkish government should agree to add toArmenia certain territories hitherto containing aconsiderable Armenian population.    If  Angora wasanimated by the friendly views just expressed, thebest proof would be to take some districts round  Karsand Ardahan and to add these to the Erivan state.There mi^ht thus be created a state to  which  the armenians could resort, which would enjoy a subetan-tial existence, and which would entertain friendly and grateful sentiments towards Turkey.   Lord  Curzongreatly hoped that the amicable disposition of An&amp;orain this respect would not be mere paper, but  a realcontribution towards a solution of the  Armenianquestion on the lines he had described.   His Ex-cell ency knew that the Armenian question excited  thewarmest interest all over the civilised world, asmuch in America as in Europe.   Throughout the warthe allied powers had pledged themselves to thecreation and security of an Armenian state and theycould not forget or abandon their pledges.    He was sure that at Paris the French and Italian governments would feel equally bound to carry out their  engage-mente and to do something tangible in this respect.Nothing would give him greater pleasure than  to beable to say that His Excellency in preliminary  con-versations had indicated the willingness of his  gov-ernment to meet these views in the manner just  ex-plained.     yussuf KPTIPI T:&apos;ey replied that the Sanjak of                                                Kars
Kars and Ardahan had  teen taken from Turkey by Russia.In neither Sanjak had the majority ever  been  Armenian.Kars had always  teen  a Turkish  fortress  and Turkishterritory.   In  Ardahan the Armenians were  extremelysparse.   The solution suggested would  only prejudicepeace between the Turks and Armenians,    The  treatyof Kars was one  made  in a friendly spirit tetweenTurkey and Armenia and should not now he changed.     Lord Curzon said that he did not now wish todetermine the precise geographical areas that thegovernment of Angora would be wise to transfer,  but if that government  was now uncompromising,  the question was likely to be raised in Paris in a more  disagree-able form and miciht provoke a less palatable  demandfor a similar solution in Cilicia or elsewhere.    Hehad suggested that the government of Angora shouldtake the  initiative in proposing a fair plan.   Thequestion was certain to be raised in Paris  and  intheir own interests and in that of peace the  govern-ment of Angora would do well to listen to this  advice.The question waB not merely one of relative numbers.If that point was insisted upon Lord Curzon couldturn it against the Turks,   Take Aivali for instance.How many  Turks did it contain?   Would  not His  Ex-cellency  be disturbed if it was proposed that itshould remain Greek because the Greeks  there vastlyoutnumbered the Turks?     Yussuf Kemal Bey begged that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not lose sight of the  actual situa-                                                tion
situation and of realities.    With that  he would pass to other questions.    The Turkish s-overnmentmust he in security in their own capital against anycoup-de-main.   The Turks claimed fulfilment  of thePrime Minister&apos;s promises in regard to Thrace, Con-stantinople and Asia Minor,  and they expected thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government  would keep their word,     Lord Curzon retorted that this was  not to thepoint.    The Prime Minister had not made such a promise,&quot;russuf Kemal Bey was alluding to conditions proposedif Turkey voluntarily abandoned hostilities againstthe allies.   Turkey had  not done so.    The conditionstherefore had long ceased to apply,     Yussuf Kemal Bey admitted this hut  said  that none the less the realities remained and the  regions  inquestion were Turkish.   Mr.Lloyd George had  recognisedthis and the principle of nationality had  been one  ofthe objects of the war.   Turkey must, therefore, hefor the Turks.   Lord Curzon had also spoken  of  theTurkish, army.   Turkey could not pay for a voluntaryarmy and her geographical situation made it  indis-pensable for her to have  one.   Her case was  not  corn-parable with that of the  other ex-enemy  countries.  Herepeated that he had come to London to learn  the  trueintentions  of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  what  weretheir final conditions of peace, and how could thecommunity of interests between the two countries  berealised?      Lord  Curznn replied that he thought  he  hadanswered this at the previous meeting when he indicated the conditions to which His Majesty&apos;s Government                                           attached
attached importance.    The  decision would,  of course,have to be taken by the allies together, but he expected the French and Italian  governments to takethe same views as those which he had  expressed.  on one point he had laid  particular stress but His Ex-cell ency had not yet referred to it.   Yussuf KemalBey had spoken of his  desire to  re-establish peace.Lord Curzon shared that desire.   But who had takenany steps to this end?   Who but His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment?   Lord Curzon had sent for the  Greeks and had asked them to accept hie advice.  The Greeks hadknown that this advice might involve  the evacuation of Asia Minor and the  cessation  of hostilities.  Never-theless they had agreed to put themselves  in his hands.   If Lord Curzon was to use his influence to-wards peace, an armistice was the first step.  He  was prepared so to inform the Greek  government  and he  hopedthat His Excellency would have  come to-day to tell him his views in response to this proposition.   HisExcellency, however,  had said nothing,     Yussuf Kemal Bey replied that this was a new proposal.   He could not answer  before referring tohis government.   Could not the  conference at Parismake this its preliminary proposal?   The  first de-cision of that conference should be the  evacuation of Asia Minor by the Greeks.     Lord Curzon replied that the allies were goingto Paris to discuss the question of peace  as a whole.He would on no account propose  evacuation  as an iso-lated measure.   Evacuation was  moreover a big question and would take months to carry out.   How  was  it                                             possible,
possible, if meanwhile the armies  recommenced fighting?An armistice was obviously a preliminary necessity.Had His Excellency referred this to his  Government?     yissuf Kemal Bey replied that he had written.He wished however to recall what happened at theLondon conference last year.   The Greek governmenthad ignored it and had gone on fighting.     Lord Curzon pointed out that  the undertakingmust of course be reciprocal.    He expected no more of the Turks than of the Greeks.    He would, however,as His Excellency not to write but to telegraph to hisgovernment.   Lord Curzon would like to  be able tosay on the first day of the conference that he had asked both Angora and Athens to agree to an armistice and that both had done so.-   The conference could then begin with a good chance of success.     Yussuf Kemal Bey replied that as Lord Curzonproposed it he would telegraph,&apos; but he hardly thought this action just.   Why had not this proposal beenpushed last year?   Because the Greek army was thenstrong?   Now it would be only fair to tell bothsides that the Greek army would go.   The Turks didnot want further bloodshed.   Why  then defer thisdecision?     Lord Curzon answered that His Excellency had apparently not quite understood.    He had said thathe would use his influence at Paris to induce theGreek government to evacuate as a  first-conditionof a general settlement and he thought that the Frenchand Italian governments would share his  view.   Butit was a preliminary necessity that the  fighting                                            should
should not recommence.    The necessity for  an armisticehad not arisen last year because the two armies werenot then in contact but were separated by many scoresof miles,     Yussuf Kemal Bey proposed that the conference should begin its labours by declaring its decisionon evacuation.     Lord Curzon repeated that the conference couldnot deal with the Eastern question piecemeal.  Hewould tell the conference what had passed and it  would create a painful impression if His Excellency made  noresponse, especially if the Greek government accepted.Yussuf Kemal Bey seemed to be under the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not impartial.This was quite wrong.   Lord Curzon had always re-fused to give encouragement or assistance to the  Greeks.His advice was, therefore, disinterested and it was asa friend of His Excellency&apos;s country that he must ask him to communicate with the government of Angora  andto try to begin the  conference with the requiredassurance.   If Lord Curzon was to tell the conference that his discussions with His Excellency had not  ad-advanced a yard, it would be a bad omen-.     Yussuf Kemali Bey repeated that he would communicate with his government, but he begged Great Birtaln toshow Turkey some proof of justice.   Such a proofwould be a decision upon evacuation at the outset ofthe conference.     LOrd Curzon said again that he was prepared, to advocate this step as the first part of the proceedingsas a whole.   Meanwhile H:is Excellency should telegraphat once so as to have an answer by Wednesday morning,                                                Yussuf
     Yussuf Kemal Bey said that the conference  wouldlast five days..   During, that time Lord Curzon  couldbe sure that there would be no hostilities.      Lord Curzon answered that it was  not a questionof five days only.   When the conference had reached its decisions they would have to he communicated and both sides would have to be heard.    They would proh-ably be invited to a full conference.    During  this necessary interval there must be no hostilities or allpossibility of peaceful negotiation would vanish.     Yiissuf Kemal Bey replied that during this  intervalthe Greeks would be still in the country and it would suffer accordingly.     Lord Curzon said that surely Turkey&apos;s firstinterest was to get the Greeks out without furtherloss.   Lord Curzon could manage that,  but not  ifthe Turks went on fighting,     Yussuf Kemal Bey thanked Lord Curzon and saidthat he would do all he could to assist him, &apos;  But ifLord Curzon could do as he said why not begin bydoins; it?     Lord Curzon once more repeated that the conference would insist on dealing with the Eastern question asa whole.     The conversation then ended.
