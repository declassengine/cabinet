THIS DQOyjMg IS TIJJ BiiOi&amp;RTY OF HIS BBITAflMIQ  MilJLSTyS, SOVTRNMSNT.                        GAB I H ti fi.                  SHIPBUILDING  PIS PUTS.           Memorandum by the Minister of  Labour.          On the 7th Maroh in CP. 3810 I reported the position of  the negotiations regarding a proposed reduotion of 26/6d per  week  in wages.   Negotiations were taken up  again  between the two  parties, but owing to the incidence of  the engineering dispute  they were adjourned until Tuesday last  the 14th.          At a conference on that date oounter  proposals first,  of  8/-, secondly of 10/- in two outs were  made by  the unions  whioh  were unacceptable to the employers: and the employers made a  final  offer to reduce wages by 16/6d in two outs, one of 10/6d  on the  29th Maroh and 6/- four weeks later, provided that the Negotiating  Committee would .1oinn with them in recommending  their offer to their respectiveconstituents.   The Negotiating  Committee wes in the difficult position of heving to report back  at each stage to a Delegate Conference  and thus were unable to  agree to make this recommendation.   The employers thereupon  announced that, their offer was \vithtirawn,  and that they would make  a reduotion of 16/6d in one out at a d&amp;te to  be communicated  later  to the union.   As regards the remaining 10/- the employers did  not withdraw their contention that it might be  necessary  to reduce  wages by that amount at a later stage,  but they were prepared to  discuss th&amp;t matter afresh in the light of the results of  the  first out.           The Delegate Conference reoeived the report of the  Negotiating Committee and passed a resolution deciding to  report  the result of the negotiations to the Minister of Labour and  to
  ask, him to  tsker steps  to appoint a Court of Inquiry under part II11  pf  the Industrial C ourts Aot,  to the pending dispute in accordance  with the request already mede  to him by the General Council of the  Trades  Union  Congress.          I sew the two  sides again end discussed with them the  possibility of re-opening negotiations.   The employers were not  prepared to make any advance  on their offer, nor  were they prepared  to continue negotiations unless the Negotiating Committee were given  full plenary  powers  to come to en agreement whioh they oould  reoommend for acceptance in a  ballot vote.   Owing to the attitude  of the  Delegate Conference, it was clear that these powers would not  be granted.   After  considerable discussion I was able to suggest to  the employers that a ballot vote of the members should be taken  without a recommendation by the union leaders, but on oondition that  the union leaders gave an explicit assurance on their behalf and on  behalf  of the Conference that  the Lxecutive Officers and Delegates of  the unions  would not take any  action to influenoe an adverse ballot.          The Negotiating Committee agreed to seek this assurance and  I accordingly proposed to the  employers that, if this assurance was  given,  their  offer  of  a reduction of 16/6d in two outs should be put  to the  ballot.          The employers  discussed the proposal and informed me that,  subject to  the assurances being given in the speoific terms which,  after discussion with  the Negotiating Committee, I was able to place  before  them,  they were prepared.to allow their offer to be voted upon  by the  men.          After a long discussion, the Negotiating Committee reported  that the Delegate Conference  were unable to givethe assurance so far  as the  Delegates were  concerned, in the speoific terms submitted and  that an alternative  resolution had been passed, whioh they considered  would, give  the employers the  assurance of non-interference with the  voting whioh  the employers desired.
        I discussed this position with both sides but the employers,while not requiring a definite reoommendation in favour of the  terms to be balloted upon, ?/ould not agree to any assuranoe which did. not definitely bind the Delegates not to influence the votes adversely.They agreed, however, at my request to meet three of the executive officers for tho purpose of discussing the position.   At thismeeting the employers made it clear that,  as the Negotiating Committeewould not recommend the accept&amp;noe of their terms and as the delegate conference would not sgree to refrain from influencing adversely a ballot of the men, negotiations were at an end.   This was reportedto me by the negotiating Committee who repeated their request forthe appointment of a Court of Inquiry.         I...-ahpuld like to have a decision on , this request L         This dispute is one concerning wages  only and, unlike  theEngineering Dispute, does not raise any fundamental issue of shopmanagement, end could by oonseni of both parties be referred for settlement to the Industrial Court or other form of arbitration.         I have not formally asked either side whether they wouldbe willing to take this course, but probably,  if asked, the men would consent, and the Employers would refuse.         In coming to a deoision on the question of granting aCourt of Inquiry this point should be kept in mind.                                          (Sgd.) T.J.
