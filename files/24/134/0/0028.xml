[This Document is the Property  of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1922.SECEET.                                                                         gC.P-3828.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF  THE  STATE OF  IRELAND.             MEMORANDUM BY THE  CHIEF SECRETARY  FOR IRELAND.    I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 6th instant.                       GENERAL STATE OF THE COUNTRY.    The most important development of the Southern Irish situation since my lastReport has been  an attempt on the part of the anti-Treaty  section  of the irish republican Army, which now controls the whole of  South Tipperary, to extend thearea of its domination by an incursion in force into the adjoining county of Limerick.In  the early morning of Sunday, the 5th instant, several bodies of armed men in civilian attire, variously estimated at numbers ranging  from 100 to 300, entered thecity of Limerick  and  established themselves in  possession of three of the principalhotels, the Technical  Institute, and  a vacant wing of the Mental Hospital.  Thepolice barrack and five military barracks in the town had recently been taken overby  the Provisional Government and  were held  by strong and  reliable garrisons oftheir supporters drawn largely from the counties of Clare and Galway,  No conflictsbetween the rival forces ensued, but two officers of the Provisional Government were arrested  by the invaders and are reported to have  been  taken away  by them toClonmel.  The Provisional  Government  were at first disposed to take a very seriousview of the situation created by this  direct challenge to their authority, and  appre-apprehensions were very generally  entertained that it would  be found impossible to avertan  outbreak of civil war, which, whatever might be  its  issue, could not fail to havedisastrous  consequences in  permanently embittering the relations between the two sections into which the  people of Southern Ireland  are now divided.  Fortunately,however, both sides showed themselves  equally  desirous of avoiding this calamity,and a tacit understanding was quickly arrived at to refrain from acts which might precipitate a conflict.  Strong reinforcements were  immediately despatched  to the scene by the Provisional Government and took up their  quarters in the city without interference by the invaders.  By Tuesday the pro-Treaty forces outnumbered their opponents by at  least-two to  one.    Negotiations have been opened up between  the opposing parties with a view toending the deadlock and reuniting the two sections of  the  Irish Republican Armyunder the authority of the General Headquarters Staff in Dublin.    Breaches of the truce have again been of frequent occurrence in districts wherethe extremist elements of the I.R.A. are in the majority.  Nine attacks upon theCrown Forces were reported during the  week, and the casualty list was extended bythe addition of three policemen killed and three wounded.  The worst of these out-rages was an ambush of a party of Royal Irish Constabulary consisting of a DistrictInspector  and twelve  other ranks, who  were held up and fired at in Main Street,Tipperary, by a large  body  of I.R.A. on the 2nd instant.  One  of the police, a headconstable, was killed and three wounded (one mortally), and the party were compelledto surrender to their  assailants  the  whole  of  their  transport, consisting of one armoured  and three other cars, and  a large quantity of arms  and  ammunition.  regret to state that there are strong reasons  for suspecting that this  outrage was organised with the treacherous connivance of some members of the police party, three off whom have since been arrested.  Two other ambushes of police parties were com-mitted during the week, one near Waterford City on the  3rd instant and the other      [8024]
between Castlecoiner and Kilkenny on the 5th instant.   No casualties were suffered,but cne armoured car and seven other cars, together with a considerable quantity ofarms and ammunition, were captured.  All these attacks are believed  to have been committed by the South Tipperary Brigade of the I.R.A., which was responsible forthe recent raids on Clonmel and Kilkenny Barracks, and for the attempted forcibleseizure of the city of Limerick.     The other two police casualties (in addition to those sustained in the Tipperaryambush) were  the  murder of a sergeant of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was shot dead in cold blood in Dublin about 3-30 P.M. on the 2nd instant, and the wound-ing of another sergeant, who was attacked in his own home at Swinford, Co.  Mayo,on the 3rd instant by a party of armed and masked raiders, who also fired at andmortally wounded his wife, who endeavoured to  protect him  by  holding a chairbetween him and his assailants.  In neither of these cases have any of the murderersbeen arrested.     Among the other  breaches of the truce committed  during the week were the seizure of a military motor ambulance at Glanmire Railway Station (Co. Cork) onthe 27th ultimo; the rescue of a prisoner from police custody  at Clonmel railway station on the 28th ultimo; an unsuccessful attack on Mountbellew Police Barracks,Co. Gal way, on the 4th instant, no casualties or damage being inflicted; the kidnap-ping of a constable in Longford on  the same date;  a raid upon  Woodlawn  PoliceBarrack, Co. Galway, on the 5th instant, resulting in  the capture  of all arms andammunition contained in the barrack; and the seizure of three police motor cars andone bicycle.     I  greatly  regret  to have  to  record the  murder of  a  well-known  and highly-respected  Irish Civil Servant, Mr. Max Green, the Chairman of  the Irish PrisonsBoard, who Was shot dead in St. Stephen&apos;s Green, Dublin, on the 3rd instant whilepluckily trying to  stop an armed bandit.   Mr. Green was a son-in-law of the late mr..  John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party.  His assailantwas subsequently arrested  and will be charged with murder.

                       THREATENED POST OFFICE STRIKE.     The threatened strike of Irish Post Office officials, which was timed to commenceat midnight of the 5th instant has happily been averted by an agreement reached only four hours earlier, between the Provisional Government and the Irish Postal Union.The agreement  provides  for the  appointment  of  a Commission consisting of  a chairman and  two other  members nominated by the  Provisional Government, andtwo representatives of the men&apos;s Unions.  This Commission will enquire  into thewhole subject of wages, salaries, organisation, and conditions of  work generally inthe Irish Post  Office, and will be required to report with  regard to  wages by the15th May.  It will be empowered  to recommend that  its findings  should be appliedretrospectively  from the 1st March  in any cases where it decides that  the  bonusreductions which came into operation  on that date have had the  effect of reducingthe total remuneration below a proper  standard.                   PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND.     The long-deferred platform campaign in favour  of the Treaty was opened on sunday with a successful public demonstration in College Green, Dublin, which was addressed by Mr. Arthur  Griffith, Mr. Collins, and other leaders of the Free StateParty.   Despite unfavourable weather conditions, a huge crowd attended  and theproceedings were characterised by a much greater degree of enthusiasm than thatdisplayed at the recent demonstration held in Dublin  by the Republican Party.   Itis intended to  hold a  series  of  similar  demonstrations throughout  the  country,commencing with one in Cork City on  Sunday, the 12th  instant.     While the need for efficient propaganda in the Southern counties is imperativeif the  Provisional Government are to combat the insidious  misrepresentations bywhich their opponents seek to subvert  the Treaty, it is of still greater urgency and importance that an early  solution should be found of the deadlock which has nowexisted for more than five weeks between the Southern and Northern Governments. Thestate of Belfast, which from the latest  accounts appears  to be growing progressivelyworse,  is a factor which is not to be  ignored in the consideration  of possible future developments in Southern Ireland, and unless some remedy  can  be  found for theconditions prevailing in that city, there will be a very real danger  of a recrudescenceof border disturbances on an even more extensive scale than those of last month,which  the Provisional Government might be powerless to  control.  The effects  ofsuch an  outbreak,  which would call  for the intervention of British troops for thedefence of the Northern territory, might well be  disastrous to the  future both of theProvisional Government and of the Treaty.  In my opinion, the only hope for peace in the  Northern area and on the  border is in an early meeting between Sir james craig and Mr. Collins.
