(This document  is the property of Hia Britannio Majesty&apos;s  Government).                            CABINET.FIDFNTIAL.                     COMMITTEE OP HOME AFFAIRS.,3846.                      TIj^TTOJ EY SUBSEQUEHI1 ^MAERIAGEc                    Memorandum by the  Home  secretary.      At a meeting, of the  Home  Affairs Committee on February 8th,  1922,(H.A..C. 103rd Conclusion)  I was authorised, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to have a Bill drafted providing for legitimation by subsequentmarriage with a view to  further consideration of the draft by the Committee.I have been in consultation with the Lord Chancellor oti the matter,  and parliamentary Counsel has  prepared the attached memorandum aontaining two alternative draft olauses  - the first on the assumption that titles  anddignities are not to be  affeoted by legitimation, and the second on  thoassumption that legitimation  is to be effective for the purpose of titles anddignities as well as for other  purposes.   Before the matter is carried  further the question should be settled  whether the first or the second principle, isto be adopted by the Government.   I accordingly submit the memorandum forthe consideration of the Home Affairs Committee, and would suggest that  theLaw Officers should bo invited  to attend the meeting of the Committee atwhich it is considered.    When  a deoision is reached on the point of prinoipleit will then probably be desirable to get the opinion of some expertconveyancer on the draft and  to  have it further considered by the LawOfficers.                                 E * S *Home Office,   15.3.22N.B.   Referenoe in made on page 3 cf the attached print to points raisedby Mr. Cherry.   Mr. Cherry is  one of the Conveyancing Counsel, Ohe&amp;ieeryDivision, who submitted  a  memorandum to the Lord Chanoellar calling  attentionto a number of difficulties which would be created by the olaU3es  in CaptainBowyer&apos;s Bill as amended in the House of Commons.                                                               4SP14
Ijegitimatio  per  subsequent           Matrimonium.                         NOTE.     The Children of  Unmarried Parents Bill, introducedlast session by Captain Bowyer, as amended in the Houseof Commons, contained the following clause :     5. (1) Where  the parents  of  an  illegitimate  person(whether born before or after  the  passing of this Act) marryone another after  the passing  of this Act the marriage shall,provided that  it is valid in accordance with  the law for thetime being in  force in England and Wales, render that person,as from the date of  the marriage,  legitimate for all purposes ;and where at  the  time of the marriage the  illegitimate personhas died leaving any issue that issue shall have the same rightof succession  to any property,  or to any title  or  dignity, as ifthe parents of that issue had been legitimate :    Provided  that where either  of the parents have betweenthe date of the birth and  the date of their marriage to one another been married to any other person any children who by virtue of the subsequent marriage  become legitimate shall  forall purposes of succession (whether to  property or to  any titleor dignity) be deemed  to be younger than  any children of theprevious marriage ; and    Provided  also that no  child made legitimate under thissection shall be entitled to succeed to or to take any property,real  or  personal, settled by a person other  than his  father ormother by any disposition prior to  the date of such marriageunless such child would have been entitled to succeed to or take such property if this Act had not been passed.     (2) Where no person  is registered  as. the father  of  anillegitimate person the registrar shall, on the application of bothparents, and on production to him of a statutory declaration made by the  person alleging himself to be the father of the child that to  the  best  of his belief he is the father, enter thename of that person as  the father, with a note referring to theapplication and giving the date thereof.     The Government did not oppose the clause on the main question  of  principle, but before it can pass into law  it requires  consideration as  respects  details both of policyand drafting.66-2A
    It is assumed that the policy of the clause is to bemaintained so far as it     (1) relates  only to marriages talcing place after the         date when the proposed change  of  law takes         place,* but in the case of such marriages legiti-         mates children born either before or after that         date; and    (2) is not confined to marriages the parties to which         were, at the  time when the child was born, free         to  marry one  another; differing in this respect         from  the law of  Scotland, according  to which         the parents of an illegitimate child must, if the         child  is to be  legitimated  by their subsequent         marriage, have been free to marry at the date  of         the child s conception  and  birth, and remained         free to marry until their marriage to one another.    Apart from these  points the proposed change of lawraises  difficulties  in connection with (a)  succession  to property, (b) succession to titles and dignities, (c) area of application,  and (cl) registration  of birth.    (a)  Succession to Property. According to the secondproviso to the  above  clause a  child  legitimated underthe Bill cannot  succeed to property under any settlementmade before the marriage of his  parents, except in thecase where  the settlement was made  by one or other  ofthose parents.    This  proposal  requires consideration  as  regards(i) existing  settlements, and (ii)  future settlements.    As respects (i) (existing settlements), it would  seemto be  just that, as the  change of law was presumably not contemplated by the settlor, legitimated children shouldnot take under  these settlements, and it is suggested thatthis principle applies to settlements made by the father ormother,  just as much as  to settlements made  by other persons.   Indeed it may even be said to apply to a greater extent, for if the illegitimate child had been born before thedate of the  settlement, the parent deliberately  excludedhim, but a settlor who was not one of the parents probablywas ignorant of the fact that an  illegitimate child existed.    *  As against this it may De pointed  out that some hardship will be caused to the parents of an illegitimate child who have regularized theirstatus by marriage before the change of law takes  place, and will there-fore be unable  to legitimate their offspring, as they would have been ableto do if they had been more dilatory about marrying.
It is probably uncommon for a man to settle money onhis children without  confining  the settlement  to  thechildren  of a particular marriage.  If, however, he has done so before the Bill passes he cannot subsequently alter the settlement, and  the difficult  cases pointed  out  byMr.  Cherry will arise.   It  is submitted, therefore, thatchildren to whom the  Bill  relates  should not be entitledto take property under any settlement made before theBill passes, whoever may be the settlor.   It might, however, be considered whether in a case where a child is legitimated  under the Bill the settlor, andpossibly also the trustees  of the settlement, should nothave power to apply to the court for  a variation of thesettlement by admitting the legitimated child to  a sharetherein.   Such a provision would require to be very care-fully framed, as the grounds  upon which a settlementmight  be  varied would  have to be specified, and on thispoint it would not be safe to legislate without  the con-currence of His Majesty&apos;s judges  or other expert critics.   The case is entirely different as regards  (ii)  (settle-ments  made after  the Bill passes).   Such  settlementsmust be taken  to have been made in full  knowledge ofthe law, and if the  settlor wishes to exclude children whowould not have been legitimate but for the passage of theBill, it will be a simple matter for him to do  so; hutinasmuch as the general principle of  the Bill  is to putthese children as far as possible  on the same basis aslegitimate children, it will probably be thought inequitablethat they should not  take  under  a gift of property ingeneral terms to &quot; A. and his children,&quot; or to &quot; the children of A.&quot;    What has  been said  leads  to the conclusion thatlegitimated children  should not benefit by  settlementsmade before the Bill passes, but  should benefit  by settle-ments made after the Bill passes, and that no distinction should  be made between  settlements  by the  father ormother and settlements by other persons.  If this course is adopted most of the difficulties indicated by Mr. Cherrywill disappear.     The  case  dealt with in  the  concluding words of  theenacting  part  of the above clause, namely, that of anillegitimate  child  who dies  leaving  issue  before the marriage  of  his parents, requires separate  consideration.The clause  provides, probably  rightly, that, in  that case,the issue are to be  treated, generally speaking,  as though
the parent had not been illegitimate, but a question arisesas to the date as  from whicli this status is to commence.Under  the  above clause, apparently the  issue wouldbe treated as  though their  deceased  parent had beenlegitimate from  birth.  This  might  give rise  to diffi-culties  in  the  case,  e.g.,   of  a  settlement  on  &quot; the&quot; children of A. living at a certain date, or in the case of&quot; any child  dying before that date on the issue of that&quot; child.&quot;   If, at that date, there  were in  existence  theissue of a deceased illegitimate child of A. the  estate couldnot  be distributed so long as A. and the. deceased child&apos;smother were  alive.    It  is  suggested  that  the propermethod of  dealing  with the  question  is to  treat  the deceased  illegitimate child, for  the purposes of  the  trans-mission of property, as if he had  been legitimate at  thetime of his death, except where the right to any propertydepends on his legitimacy at  a  date prior to the marriageof his parents.     (b) Succession to Titles and Dignities. As the aboveclause stands a legitimated child cannot succeed to anytitle or  dignity.  Whether this  provision should stand is aquestion of policy which remains to be decided.     The  grant of a peerage  in ordinary cases is to a man&quot; and the heirs of his body lawfully begotten,&quot; and  it certainly  may be said that if legitimated children are admitted  to  succeed  to  titles  granted in this  form, theoriginal grant will have been enlarged.   Moreover, underthe  law as it stands at present, if a peerage were granted in the above terms to a person  domiciled in Scotland, it isdoubtful  whether  a  legitimated  son  could succeed,&quot; andthe  law  in  this respect should certainly be  the same inScotland  as  in England.  On the other  hand, in view ofthe  general principle underlying the  proposed legislation,there does not seem any very  clear reason on  the  meritsfor  distinguishing between  succession  to property andsuccession to titles.     The  effect of enabling a child to succeed to property and  not  to  titles might  obviously result in an  undesiredseverance of title and estate, for the  holder of a  titlemight not be willing, or even  able, to disinherit a son  of    * The  Lauderdale peerage case (L.R. 10 A.C. 1692) would seem atfirst sight to be a decision to the  contrary, but that ease was decided on questions of domicil and tlie admlssibUity of certain evidence, and it ispossible that the Lauderdalo  peerage, which was created in 1624, maynot have been granted in the terms which have siiice become general.
his who was legitimate according to law;  but he might be faced with  the  alternative of so doing  or  allowing hisbrother, or some other relative, to succeed to the title butnot to the family estate.  It  is true that if legitimatedchildren are allowed to succeed to  titles as  well  as to property, the separation of title and estate might equallytake place in the case of property settled before  the Actpasses, always supposing that these children are not allowedto take property under existing settlements;  but in this case the legitimated child, instead of taking  the propertywithout the title Avould take the title without  the property.As respects  future settlements no difficulty need occur.   If it  is decided  that legitimated  children are  to succeed to titles and dignities, the drafting  will  have tobe considered, for it is obvious that by merely  saying thata child  is rendered legitimate as from a certain  date, anexpress limitation of descent to heirs lawfully begottenis not  negatived.   It  Avould not  be  right  to say  ingeneral terms that legitimated children are to be deemedto have been lawfully begotten, because the incidents oflegitimacy generally speaking are only to take place afterthe marriage of  the parents ;  and on  the  other hand thereis a certain  absurdity in saying  that a child,  not in factlawfully begotten, shall be deemed to be lawfully begottenas from a  certain  elate.  Probably  the  simplest  thingwill be to  say simply that for the purpose  of succession to titles  and dignities  the  legitimated  child shall  bedeemed to have  been lawfully begotten.    (c) Area of  apiolication. The clause quoted  above issilent as to the area  of its application, but  the Bill ofwhich  it formed part  did  not apply  to  Scotland  andIreland.  The exclusion of Scotland and Ireland  is notcorrect in this context, as the Bill clearly ought to  affectthe succession to property in  Scotland and  Ireland, and,indeed, in  any  part of  the  world.  But  inasmuch  aslegitimacy  depends upon  the father&apos;s clomicil, it  wouldseem that  the Bill should be confined to cases in  whichthe father  of the  legitimated child  was at the  date ofhis marriage domiciled in England.   This would probablycorrespond  to the   law  in  Scotland, although it  is not quite certain that there it is not necessary for  the domicilto have been Scottish at  the date of the birth, as wellas at  the date of the marriage.  It is  at present necessaryfor the father of the child to be domiciled in  Scotland at     66                    B
Loth dates for the legitimation of the child to he recognised by English law (see in re Grove 10 Ch. D. 216).     It would seem that provision should also be made fordealing with the right of inheritance by descent to real property in  England not only by persons  legitimated bythe Bill, but  also by persons domiciled out of  England,in a  country the  law of Avhich admits the  principle of subsequent legitimation, who become legitimated by thatlaw.  It  was decided by the House of  Lords in Doe d.Birtichistle v.  Vardill (7 C. &amp; E. 895) that  no one is entitled  to inherit real property in England by descentunless horn in actual matrimony, and that therefore merelegitimation is not in itself sufficient.  On the other hand it would seem right that in such cases, and in the caseof personal property succession to whicli is governed bythe  laAv of  England, the place  of the  legitimated childin the order of succession should be regulated not by thelaw of his domicil but by the law of England, i.e., accordingto the principles  laid down  in the first proviso to theabove clause.     (d) Registration  of  Birth. Subsection (2)  of  theabove clause contains machinery for correcting the register of births on a child becoming legitimate.     Under the law as it stands  at present, no person  canbe registered as the father of an illegitimate child unless,at the time of registration, both parents admit paternity,and  there is  no statutory authority for any subsequentalteration of the register, although in practice the nameof the  father is sometimes  allowed to be  inserted.   InScotland  there is  express  authority,  where a  child inlegitimated, for recording that fact in the register.     A provision*  was, at the instance of the Registrar-General, moved by the Home Office representative as  amanuscript amendment on  the report  stage of CaptainBowryer&apos;s Bill in the House of  Commons, in substitution for the  said subsection (2).  It was withdrawn on objectionbeing taken  to [an amendment  of such importance beingmoved  without notice.   The   form suggested  by the registrar-General seems  preferable  to  that  in  the Bill,but there seems no reason why it should not be  extended    * The provision  suggested  by  the  Registrar-General  ran  asfollows :     &quot; It shall be competent for the Registrar-General  on production of;      satisfactory evidence to authorise at any time the re-registration       of the birth of any person made legitimate under this section.&quot;
so as to  apply to a  parson born  in  England who islegitimated by (say) Scottish law.    It  should  also  be pointed  out that the provisionsuggested by the Registrar-General does not make it quite clear how the process  of  re-registration is to be carriedout,  and it  is  not easy to see how the register could be corrected in such a  way  as  to remain  accurate, and yetnot leave it  apparent that the  child was, at the time ofits birth, illegitamite.   It has  been suggested  that  this difficulty might be to  some  extent  surmounted if powerwere  given to issue a certificate of birth in which no mention of the parentage  was made but only  the name ofthe child and the date  of the birth was stated.    The appended clauses have been drawn to give effectto the above suggestions.   They are drawn in alternative forms A on  the assumption  that legitimation  is notto affect the descent of titles  and  dignities; B on theassumption that it is.
