Unenployed in some parts of the country are showing signsof truoulence:  there was disorder at Newcastle last week.     Efforts to avert the threatened lock-out of members of the-AmalgeJnated Engineering Union have so far failed and unlesslater negotiations are successful it is possible that theFederation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions may be involved.  Da February, 1922, the Amalgamated Engineering union had a membership of 409,219,, 92,884 of whom were unemployed,and had spent  2,162,387 in unemployment benefit since theprevious July.     Reports indicate that the majority of engineers do not desire to strike but feel that the employers are determined totake advantage of their weakened union in order to inoreasehours and reduce wages.     Agitators are fully alive to the possibilities which would arise, given existing unemployment,  from a stoppage in theengineering and shipbuilding industries.     The failure of the Labour attack in the recent Metropolitanelections has greatly disappointed the organisers:  the Communistcandidates, Dakpin, Holt and Hawkins polled less than a thousandvotes between them.     During the week Communist branches have been largely oocupiedwith discussion of the Theses of the Third International.     According to George Lnnsbury&apos;s statements, given in thisreport, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is still in deep water.
                                                              HiTHE UNEMPLOYED          On February 28th the wholly unemployed on the live     registers totalled 1,837,233.  as against 1,861,815 on     February 21stt a decrease of 24,582 in one week and of over     97,000 in the last seven weeks.        .  Against the improvement in these figures must be set     reports of growing discontent  among the unemployed in     certain Industrial districts:   on Tyne-side,  in the East     Midlands and in the West of Scotland there are signs that the     discontinuance or diminution of unemployed benefit may     result in sectional disturbances.          On March 3rd about 1,500&apos;*f the Newcastle unemployed,     headed by the band of the tramwaymen on strike,  marched ta     the offices of the Guardians who reoeived a deputation     headed by a local communist named Cameron:  the deputation     carried into the Board&apos;room a  banner bearing  skull and cross     bones and a few war medals:  the demands of the National     Administrative Council of Unemployed were put forward.   After     the deputation had withdrawn the Board agreed to hold  a     special meeting on the&apos;following Monday:   the crowd outside     had meanwhile attempted to force an entrance,  and had  thrown     bottles,  stones and other missiles at the police,  three of     whom were injured.    Several of the unemployed were under     the influence of drink and  the  police were eventually  forced     to  use their truncheons:    some  windows were  broken,  several     persons were arrested for being  drunk and disorderly  and  two,     G.R.  Price  and  W.J.  Dad swell, were subsequently  charged with     endeavouring to disturb  the  public peace  by inciting  others     to  riot:  Price was bound over  in his own recognisances of   .   5  and  one  surety  of  5  to be of good behaviour  for twelve&quot;    months:   Dadswell was bound  over for the  same  period  in his     own  recognisances  of  forty shillings.   On March  4th a  meeting
of about 800 unemployed was  addressed  by  J.  Cameron  and Geoi)tWheeler to whom reference has been made  in previous  reports.On March 6th a special meeting  of the  Guardians received adeputation of unemployed:  a deputation  of local trades &quot;peoplewas also present to protest  against  any  increase in  the reliefgrants and pointed out that  it  was impossible  for tradesmento pay increased rates:  the Board eventually  decided to adherto the existing scale of reliefs     The unemployed in the last Midlands  appear to be gettingvery embittered and my correspondent reports that there are many oonverts to socialism.  J.V. Leokie, of  the ComnunistParty la active in this area.     The Chief Constable of  Coventry Informs me that thereis dissension among the local unemployed  who had. a distinctlyacrimonious meeting on March 6th.     There appears to be a slight improvement. In theunemployment situation in Yorkshire, although  some res tie ssneis apparent in Huddersfield  where the  unemployed broke awindow in the Guardians&apos; Offices on  March 3rd.     A slight- Improvement in the general  situation is also reported from Lancashire and Cheshire.     Haye, the secretary of  the National  Administrative Councl     .....       . i ,    j \ *of Unemployed, has been informed by  J.H.  Jackson, thesecretary of the Ashton-under-Lyne,  Bukinfield  and districtcommittee that on Maroh 2nd  the northern  area  conference pasitthe following resolution:                  .          &quot;That a communication be. sent  to  the national     I    :&apos;; secretary requesting him to draw  up  a  olroular  to be Bflt     out immediately to all  committees ^formulating  a policy&apos;&quot;yi     &apos;actioh in reference&apos;to  eViotlon^ arising out of the )     withdrawing of the Rent Restriction  Aot.&quot;     On March 7th a demonstration, of unemployed marched to anengineering factory in Lincoln  to. protest against theworking of overtime.                                                       The/
          The national demonstration of unemployed, which was to     have been held in Scotland, on March 3rd, did not take place in     so far as the Glasgow area is concerned, but there was a     demonstration in Edinburgh.THE COMMUNISTS          The adjourned sitting of the Executive of the Communist     International opened in the  Kremlin on February 21st:  97     &quot;delegates&quot; represented 36 countries.   The following Presidium     was unanimously elected:  Zinoviov, Arthur MacManua,  Clara     Zetkin,  Carr, Valecki,  Sturz, Qachin,  Roberto, Katayama and     Jacob Friis.   On February 23rd MacManus addressed  the     conference and,  probably with an eye on financial  assistance,     painted  a glowing picture of the British Communist Party:  he     claimed  that the party  had very great political influence and     that it  was a centralised and disciplined party called upon, to     play a part of historical importance&apos; :   he further added that     the labour Party feared the  growth of the Communist Party.          According to the first  reports received MacManus  said on     February 27th:               &quot;In England we are not afraid of coming  into          con tact,even with leaders of Opportunist Parties.  For          instance we are now prepared&apos; to enter the ranks of the         . labour Party.  At  the coming Trade Union Congress our          position will be one of great advantage on the grounds          of  a united front.   The leaders of the Right  are already          showing  anxiety in this matter.&quot;          The  Communist Party is  now devoting attention tS the     organisation  of the women1s  movement and Mrs.  Helen Crawfurd,     who recently  returned from the Continent; is to take  the chair     at  a forthcoming meeting of  women members in London and the     Home Counties:   the leaders  appear to be   Mary Moorhouse, Minn     Birch, Mrs. Hawkins and  R. Franklin.   The meeting  will     probably  set  up  a London Women&apos;s District Committee:   the     publication of a women&apos;s paper will be  considered  and  the     instructions  of  the Third Congress of the Third International
ras laid down in the Thesis, &quot;Work  among Women&quot;  will  be  carriedcut as far as possibleB particularly  in relation tc the  tradeunions, the Labour Party arc  the co-operative movemento   Themeeting intends to ash the national executive to allocate anannual grant from the Party funds  for work  among women.     In this connection interest attaches to a remark -made bySylvia Penkhurst on March 5th:   she said that it was  quite truethat Russian money had been spent  in  this country on  communist propaganda:  the Third International  sent sums of money  tocommunists in all parts of the world:   in her opinion it was cotsuch a terrible thing as some people  seemed to think.     It is reported on.the authority  of a single informant that Sylvia Pankhurst has-formed  a branch of the  Fourth  Internatiomat Portsmouth and that some sailors and soldiers have becomeunofficial members. ;.v It is alse  reported that R. Bishop  hasbeen detailed by the Communist Party  for propaganda work in thenavy and army* - He has been in possession of a packet of leaflets entitled &quot;The- Shadow of ,the  Swo&apos;rd&quot;:  this leaflet,  acopy of which is in my possession, is apparently intended for circulation among the  armed Forces.   The leaflet is plausiblywritten and deals at length from the  communist standpoint withthe me an ing,&apos;: cause of  and responsibility for war, indictinggovernments, armament  firms,  the press, &quot;militarists&quot; anddesire for territorial expansion.  The  leaflet continues:          &quot;We have seen the underlying  &apos;cause of  war:  who     provides the guns;  and  who arouses the hate. Let  us     now study the.cannon-fodder.                 -              j         - &quot;How.:is this cannon-fodder  collected?   First let us     consider, the regular forces,  the Army  and Navy.   In theory,     in this country,  these forces are  volunteers. No longer&apos;     does the-press-gang go -ashore and  force men.en tc the     King&apos;s:&apos;ships;  no longer does - each Parish contribute its   ]     quota to the Militia. - There&apos;  is  no need.    From  the large  (     industrial./towns, where  men are  often  unemployed, or sieepyj     little villages that held no  prospect  for their  youths,    \    ; corns men,who most live,  hungry,  and often desperate.     This hunger is the &quot;modern- press-gang.  Sir  Ian Hamilton has     recorded his opinion that 95$ cf enlistments into the army.      are of those &quot;who cannot obtain the most poorly paid job&apos;-                  &quot;     - -:                                 Nor/  I
 Nor is such testimony at all necessary.  A moment&apos;s reflection should show that nothing  short of hunger  and destitution would force a yOung; man  to contract  himself, vfpV long -years, into military slavery.  And; once in  the service it is left to military  discipline and&apos;  the fen&apos;,eral, environment to; create -a certain&apos;&apos; type&quot; of  mind.  y. lectures,  sermons, etc&apos;. ,i the men  are fed&apos;:wi&apos;tb ridiculous, notions of politics, industrial- questions,  and&quot; other phases of civil life-  They are moulded  as a class apart. from the ir civilian&apos; brethren.  B That-&apos; is ne cess ary,  indeed;, vittal, for the- ruling class. 1 For&quot; whether, one day,  they are .led out/against their fellow-workers of other lands:,.; or;, against their own &apos; countrymen,--it is essential that.soldiers or sailors are unencumbered by intelligent ideas.  A soldier owes no duty to  his, relatives, to his workmates f or -&quot;his  class&quot;.  Ho mast only obeya   He mast take rifle and speed  a bullot straight  into his;.fellows^head and think neither&apos;of&quot; cause nor-result...      &quot;So by sheer hunger are men pushed forth  to fight and die for the greed and ambitions  of those, who. deny them work &quot;and-comfort in civil  life.          -;;&apos; ;    ..  &quot;Cf the ;civiliahs dragged into war the :story is the same.;.-The-,atmosphere is first  created by newspapers, Go vernmerit-con trolled,  who tell of the&apos;--frightfuln ess  that will  befall, women and children  oniSe  the enemy  sets foot on the native, soil. ,- The prostitution of women&quot; and  the starvation of children in times of peace are conveniently -for-gottenv- (At &quot;this,: some -men  .volunteer, hot&apos;many.  Then employers are told by the Government not to employ, single ,-ra.en so as to compel them -to ^olutttfcW.^rf S&apos;ln&quot;gi%&apos;&apos;men are wanted fir?*t only because they are cheaper...      &quot;The married men follow, lingering and cursing but, they, follow. \ &apos; Zing,,  Prime Minis ter,  Politician,&apos;  Bishop, all tell the  dupes what heroes  they  are, encouraging them  with fine promises to be fulfilled  after the&apos;war&apos;.&apos;&quot; Even Music  Hall pantaloons with their insane patter are pressed into  service  and /rewarded for keeping the dupes  cheerful at the  grim; game.-&apos;of;murder.  And to  the flattery of these parasites the-huge-armies move  toward the zone of slaughter, each man to draw from  Pate&apos;s lottery a whole carcase,  a wooden limb, a shattered mind, or a. Cenotaph! To ccmpel men  to move thus, in  overwhelming masses, uncomplaining  to their death, and to believe that they, ars:going^voluntarily - this is the;very -cream of the art&apos; of Government.      &quot;But suppose ^he.masses one day refuse?  Suppose ,, they  laugh at  the tinsel excuses for war, end perceive&apos; the real, reasons?   What if they say that they will defend  . hearth  and home  at the hearthslde?  Or What&apos;if :they turn on.those  who  bid them fight,  and demand homes and liv&amp;sworth defending?  And are these suppositions so impossible...       .. .  .      &quot;Such is,the distaste for.war to-day, that  the determined effort of a comparatively small body&quot;of men could stop it.   They can stop it by cutting out  the economic  cancer of war.   In the short breathing  space before  the next  war  there is not a moment to lose organising opposition to war.&quot;&apos;Never/
           &quot;/Never  again&apos;  should  ba  the  rallying cry of the     workers  in  all lands.   Let  the  abundance and  resources of     earth; no longer be  a cause  of  dissension snd; slaughter,     let them, be used  for the  good  of all.    Our time on earth.      is short enough  as it  is;   why not devote it to making ths     world.a  secure and  pleasant place  for  all to  live in?           &quot;/War  is a game, which; if men were wise, kings would     not play at  said a great writer On. one occasion.  Let us     learn to be wise, so that succeeding generations may be frjj     from the folly and  wickedness5which in these  days darkens     our lives and threatens our future.&quot;     The electoral committee of  the  Communist Party of GreatBritain has announced  officially its decision to run the followitcandidates:     Bast Ley ton                  C.L.

It is impossible at the present to guarantee  more than  this.&quot;    , On March 5th about  3,000  people attended a meeting heldloader the auspices of  the Communist  Party of Great Britain inTrafalgar Square:  a large section  of the audience was cotiposed ooontingents from Woolwich, Camberwell,  Poplar,  Stepney, Fir^fcury
 ex.   St.  Panoras:   a good deal  of literature was sold  and money was freely  thrown  on  the  plinth.    The  following resolution was carried unanimously;           &quot;This mass  meeting of workers assembled in  Trafalgar Square     views with profound indignation the continued imprisonment of     communists end  others  In  English end  Scotch prisons fcr the mere     expression of opinions distasteful to the ruling class.   It     regards such persecution  as evidence  of the complete breakdown     cf  the principle., wf political  democracy on which British     Capitalism professes to rest,  and as  proof of the need for     greater vigilance and  stronger organisation on the part of the     workers.           &quot;It  demands the unconditional release of all those now     imprisoned and more especially couples this demand with the case     cf  Albert Inkpin,  secretary of the  Communist Party of Great     Britain,  whose  only offence consisted in being concerned in the     publication  of Communist  literature,  the free and unhindered     distribution of  Which  is  carried on by the workers In every     other great,  country In Europe.&quot;     The speakers included  R.  Bishop (chair)t Frank SmithfAmalgamated Engineering Union), Tom Mann,  T. Jackson (sub-editor of &quot;The Communist&quot;) D. Large,  (St. Pancras Labour  Party), H. Young (Young Communist League&quot;), Councillor Wall,. V. Beeeham and John Steele, now an inmate of Kensington  Workhouse.                              &apos;&apos;           :     The following extracts are taken from Councillor Wall&quot;s speech.           &quot;I am here  as a communist...Our  cry,  eur movement ,is for  -     revolution cut and...ou,t, namely, total abolition  of. the Capitalist     olass, and it&apos; is because  we are advocating that  kind of policy:     that  the  authorities&apos;are  attempting to make the  Ccmmunist Party     an  illegal  one.  So far  as we are conoerned if  they make our     organisation an  illegal organisation,  well then, they will make us     a hundred times, more powerful  then ever.  It is  not the f.*rst     time  in the-  history of the working class movement that we have, had   .  to  be an  illegal organisation.   So far as we are concerned,  we     trouble not  whether we are legal or illegal.  All that we are.     concerned about&apos;is carrying en our propaganda for the revolution...     I have come  along this afternoon:, knowing personally what it is     to  be inside, a gaol considerably longer than Inkpin has g^ne for.   .  I know what  it is,  therefore,  I am asking the workers if it is net    &quot; discreditable  to the London Labour movement itself that thay have     not been up  and  doing, and if  ycu had  the go,  if you lived up  to     the traditions which you  are claiming  for yourselves as  British     subjects, then you would  be up at Pentonville and burn the damned   :  place down altogether.  It is.no use  talking about resolutions     when  you  ought to  go and  push  the bally place- ever.&quot;     On March 5th about  500 people  attended a communist meeting in ft)             : Battarsea  Town Hall,  which  was addressed by Councillor Wall (chair),A. Siffleet, T.A.  Jackson,  Saklatvala and Ex-Colonel  Malone,  M.P.:  thelast named condemned  the present prison system,  touched on Ireland  and-Egypt,  attacked the Prime Minister,  stressed  the tragedy  of the RussinnFamine and indulged in  general  criticism of government policy in  regard                                                                 to/
to unemployment  and expenditure.   The  collection  realised   6*1.10 d.     Invitations to the policy  conference  of  the  Communist Party  appearto have been  sent to  the executives  of foreign parties:  the  ConanunistuParty of  Italy has replied that it cannot  send a  delegate  as  it is holdingits second national congress  in Rome on the same  date.     Piquant  letters  have been  exchanged between  the Coventry communists and Robert Wijliipsu in regard to  the parliamentary  candidature:   each  sidedemands that  the  othei withdraw but  so far neither  has moved.  The chief constable informs me  that Jack  Leckie, according  to a statement made at a communist meeting on  March 5th,  has  signed the questionnaire  quoted in last we.ek&apos;s report:   this act might  bring  him a few unemployed votes inthe event of  an  election.                        ..       ,     The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that several communistmeetings have been held in his  area  during the week.;  the  audienceshave varied from 20 to 200 and  the main theme of  the speeches has been therecent arrest of Swain and Ganley:   on March  5th  John Trotter abused thepolioe and the prosecuting counsel to such an extent that  the question of taking action against him for a breach of  his reoognisance  is underconsideration.     Nosaka,  the  Japanese communist, to whom  reference has  been made in previous reports, wrote from Berlin  to Sylvia Pankhurat  on  March  2nd:          &quot;Until  the  beginning  of  January  of  this year tram November     last I was  In Moscow.  Now,  I am going back  to our  country where I aa     instructed  to work In our  Union.  I urgently hope our  relationship     with you becomes closer and more con ore teV&apos;     Further  light is thrown on the  financial aspect of  Saklatvala&apos;parliamentary candidature in Battersea by  the following  communication fromChaman Lai, dated Bombay, February 17th, 1922:          &quot;Thank  you very much  for your letters and your cable.   Your     personal affairs are receiving my closest attention.   You will hear     more about  them next week.  Meanwhile I  am collecting  funds  for your     contest  and  have also approached Mukandi and Pawar  regarding the sum     owing to you by  them.  Pawar  is hopeless as  he has  no  money  but 1*11     try and  get  some out of Mukandi.                    r-.r;          &quot;I  have sent the Government of India our  circulars  on Workmen^     Compensation as well as Registration  and Protection of Trade Unions.     You will find in these all  that you ask  me to  do in your cable,  Will     put up a stiff fight here, donrt fear.          &quot;About my coming to England all  depends upon circumstances.  I am     launching out a new weekly newspaper  devoted whole-heartedly to Labour.     All therefore, depends on  how the venture goes.  But  rest assured if     I can come  I&apos;ll be in London  before May  first.

Exactly,.how, this, can     or will be done I do not know; but  I went everybody     to understand -that&apos; Victoria House,  a valuable property,     paying its Way and with relatively  vbry small liabilities,     is now at the disposal of the Executives of the Trade     Union Labour Movement as an absolutely&apos;free gift ...v,   t.,      &quot;The shares are held by C. W.  Bower marl,&apos;Arthur     Henderson and myself.  There are 500  1 shares .   , held in trust for the employees.  I shall transfer    : the shares-I hold to anyone else-the General Council    .,may decide to elect whenever an affirmative decision is  &quot;:!&apos;: taken re the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;-, ;     .     ,. , ,    ,          &quot;With regard to the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;,, trade unions     and other friends have put up about  130,000.  Other ;r&quot;   friends&apos;during the period since we ^started in 1911 have     found us quite double that sum, without ever asking for ;&apos;-   or obtaining any kind of control-.   Up till about two     years ago I was absolutely free to  do as I pleased either  -   With the money or the paper, e^except that the. money should     be spent wisely for the benefit of  the Labbtir &quot;movement. &apos;    When we asked .the;..unions,about 30 months agp.,to, find us     money,  it was clear that we were bound in hdhohr to give     them some control.  Consequently our Board of Directors     was strengthened by the addition of throe representatives                                                     of/
          of the unions and one representing ce-operative          societies who hed invested.  Now another stage has          been reached.  The paper must become the official          organ of the united Labour movement, industrial and          politioal.  This is inevitable.               &quot;Therefore, in order that those who are to          find the money and assume control may not be hampered          in any way, I have informed those concerned that if          it is thought desirable I am auite willing to stand          on one side and give up all responsibility for..          Victoria House, of which I am chairman, as well1as          my position as editor and manager of the &quot;Daily Eerald&quot;1         In January Lansbury sent an appeal for. financial help    to one of his acquaintances in India and. said that if the    paper failed &quot;I believe quite honestly that the greatest    power in the country for securing a peaceful revolution, in    the social and industrial life of the country would be gone.&quot;         A deputation from the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; recently    interviewed the National Committee ..of. the Co-operative Party    who agreed that, pending the issue of a daily paper for    co-operators, members should be asked to support the    &quot;Daily .Herald&quot;.IP ISH .REV PL UTIONARY AO TIV IT IE 5 IN TH5- UNITED KINGDOM         There are signs of incroased activity in Irish    Republican Army and Irish Republican Brotherhood circles in  - Great Britain, chiefly in the direction of organising drafts  [  of young men to strengthen the. extreme section, of the    Republican Army in Ireland, and also to arrange for supplies    of arms,  etc   Roderick 0&apos;Connor, who has an office in    Dublin,  is now reported as being in chief command of the Irish    Republican Array in Great Britain,  Joseph Vyze acting as    Brigadier in Scotland with James Fullerton as his assistant.         Joseph Robinson of Glasgow,  who was released from    penal servitude on the 25th February and belongs to a family    of notorious extremists,  is going to Ireland this week to   )    consult with Roderick 0* Connor and his brother Seamus RobinscJ                                                          who/
 who  is in command of the South Tipperary Brigade,  Irish Republican Army,  now in  open revolt against  the  Provisional Government,      A man named  Scanlon,  whose temporary headquarters are  in Manchester,  is reported  to be collecting arms,  etc.,  in  the North of  England,  and to visit Scotland  from time  to  time for  the came  purpose.      So far as the open  side of the movement is  concerned,  there is nothing but apathy and&apos; confusion.   Art OrBrian  is  busy defending his character  against the startling attacks of Charles Diamond and other supporters of tho Free State.  The  Headquarters staff of  the  Irish Republican Army  are at sixes  and sevens,  money is only coming in in driblets and they are afraid  of  losing  their jobs.   The paid officials  of the League  have a wholesale dread of coming down on the wrong side of the  fence.      At a meeting of the Manchester District&apos; Committee last  week a proposal by Mr-  Addio  that the Irish Self-Determination organisation  be turned into an anti-Free State movement  was defeated.      In Leeds there is also a growing  feeling that the organisation should support the Free  State,   in  Executive meeting  was held there  on  Sunday 5th March,  and in order  to lend  support  to  the Republicans a contingent which  included  Mrs.  Sadiet Art  ovBrieii, George Mortimer,  Martin  Molohey, Sean  Harvey and P. D* Harte travelled from London  to attend.      The  Glasgow  meeting of the  27th February addressed  by  Sean Etchingham was not  a success,     De Valera is  said to  be  arranging to  visit  Glasgow  and  the wire pullers  intend to take  St,  Andrews  and  the  City  Halls for the occasion.     Henry Butchinson. Treasurer of  the  Scottish Sinn FeinExecutive, has been  absent,  in.  Dublin for  some days, attendingan Executive  Council meeting of  the new  organisation  (FineGhaedheal), formed  in Paris in January last.   He is suspected                                                   of/
of having converted some of the Sinn Fein funds to hisown use and is now endeavouring to rush the aooountsthrough without producing vouchers.  Comparatively large sums said to have been received by him are.not accountedfor but this fact has not yet reached the ears of the rank and file; when it does trouble may be looked for.     Some of the Scottish Clubs, supporters of the FneeState,  are holding back their affiliation fees untilthe leaders deoide on a future policy.
