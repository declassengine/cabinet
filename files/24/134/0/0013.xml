     Steps necessary to introduce new electoral  systems  in                     Great Britain.          It is, difficult to contemplate the introductionintc this country of any changes in the electoral system excepteither the Alternative Vote or a system cf P.R.                     Alternative Vote.          The Alternative Vote as a solution of the difficultiescf single member constituencies dees net require any changein the present system of constituencies in this country, ,except,perhaps, as regards the 11 two-member constituencies..   Apartfrom the case of these two-member constituencies,, which might require special consideration, all that requires to be done tointroduce the Alternative Vote is to amend the Ballot Act bythe substitution of the necessary provisions as to therecording and reckoning of the votes oast.   Detailed procedurehas already been worked cut for this purpose in the draft rules(Od.8768) prepared and published during the passage cf the representation of the People Act,. 1916, which, it will beremembered, originally contained, in accordance with theRecommendations&apos;cf the Speakers Conference, provisions apply-ing that method of election ih certain eases.                            P ft          As regards the form of P-..R. known as the single transferable Vote  (the form supported by  the ?, Society.)all the machinery has already been worked out and is readytc hand so  far  as  the procedure at elections is  concerned.Election by that method applies already in the case of universities in Great Britain. Scottish Education Authorities,Irish Local Government elections and. Parliamentary  elections  inNorthern and Southern Ireland.   Elections have  taken place-according  to this method and  the procedure is a  recognised
and familar one.   The legislation necessary to give effectto the procedure oould thus be modelled on existing Acts,incorporating the draft rules for S.T.V. included in the document 0d.857&amp; already referred to.          But it would be necessary to convert our presentsingle member constituency system into a series of constituencieswith a number of members.   This is an operation which might take considerable time if it were done with great respect forlooal prejudices.   The Boundary Commission appointed inpursuance of the Representation cf the People Act, 1916,carried out a grouping cf 100 seats into PA constituencies ofnot less than three or more than five members:   they took twocr three months over this and endeavoured to secure localconsent by a system of local enquiries and consultations.  the fruits of their work are still available,   On the other hand, itis understood that the grouping of constituencies for thepurpose of this method of election in Ireland was carried outpractically on paper without any great delay) and that the grouping thus deviaed has not been challenged.          If it is proposed to limit the number of members to a constituency to,say, five, oases will arise in which boroughswould need to be divided;  and this  task would be a difficult and delicate one.   If a higher limit is placed on  the numberof members it might be more feasible to group by ParliamentaryBoroughs or Parliamentary Counties without  elaborate enquiriesor consultations.          As regards the steps necessary to introduce anyList system of P.R., apart from the  presumable unlikelihoodof any such system obtaining acceptance in  this country,  theexisting systems vary so greatly in  type and  features that  itis impossible to indicate any preliminary steps  except  byobserving that  constituencies would  need to be grouped  andthe Ballot Act  would need to be amended.
                     DENMARK.          Under the 1867 Constitution P.R. was  employed  for theUpper House,   For the Lower House the system adopted was  thatof majority elections in single member constituencies.          Originally, however, two parties only, Conservativesand Liberals, were in the field:   but two new  parties,  theSocial Democrats and the Radicals, subsequently arose and  gave rise to dissatisfaction with the existing system.          By the 1915 law a mixed compromise system was  adoptelunder which Copenhagen elected 24 seats by a List system of P.R.,while elsewhere 93 seats were decided by.majority elections insingle member constituencies, and 23 additional scats were distributed among the parties to render their representation as nearly as possible proportionate to their aggregate votingsupport throughout the country *          This law was in force at the 1918 election.   As betweenthe two opposing conbinations, the Radicals and Socialistssupporting tho Zahle Ministry, and the Opposition, a closeproportionality of seats was  secured;  but within the Coalitionthere were anomalies, the&apos; result being largely due to a defensive alliance between the Radicals and Socialists who found themselves obliged to support each others candidates in morethan half the constituencies.:  Had,these two parties runcandidates separately the Liberals ,would have got 9 seats Inexcess of their voting strength and could, in combination withthe Conservatives, have&apos;-commanded a Parliamentary majority on a minority of  votes.          With this:election, which resulted in two opposingcombinations ef nearly equal  strength, the Liberals were naturallysatisfied;  but the  Conservatives entered into negotiations withthe Socialist Radical Coalition for the amendment of the system,mainly, it would appear, to enable each party to present Itsown candidates free  from &quot;entangling  alliances&quot;-.   An agreement
had practically been reached for the extension of P.R. tomulti-member county areas when in 1920 the Slcsvig crisis placed the negotiators in acute opposition.   The Liberal Conservativeconbination secured the fall of the Zahle Ministry and a generalelection was about to take place under the 1915 law.   But theSocialists objected to being again forced into a defensivealliance with the Radicals In order to avoid being placed in a minority with a majority of-votes;  and a general strike tookplace-.          The result was tho 1920 P-R. law., under which multi-member constituency P.R.. .w s c  extended to the whole country.There was, however., a special feature designed to retain the connection  of members with smaller constituencies.   The mainmulti-member constituencies wore subdivided into nominatingdistricts..   Candidates are nominated in respect of districts;and though votes might be given, for, a district to candidatesoutsido tho district, the locally nominated candidate had a distinct advantage..   The feature of additional seats distributed among the parties to render their representation moreproportionate, to their voting support was .-.also retained..          This system was used In connection with three general elections In- 1920 .   Roughly, the. result may.be stated asfollows.   Ignoring the small additional parties and groups.whichhad by this-time sprung: up., the seats obtained at the SeptemberElection were: .  Conservatives 27:   Liberal 5i..   Radical 18: *Socialist 48.   As previously indicated under the previous lawthe Socialist Radical combination were in  a majority over theConservative Liberal  combination on a- nearly e&quot;qual distributionof voting support.

A- record number  of  electors polled,  thofigure  in April being 80^.&apos;
                      P KKrlOii *          The system of elections in the Chamber of Deputies hasoscillated since 1371 between the block vote multi-member system(scrutin de listc) and the single member constituency system.The latter was introduced In 1376: &apos;  in 18S5 there was a returnto the block vote system, and a reversion to the single membersystem in 1889.   Under the 1889 systesn the Second Ballot was inoperation, all  candidates being permitted to stand at theSecond Ballot and the issue being decided by a relative majority.          Proposals for the introduction of P.R. had been beforetho French Legislature on more than one occasion and at one timethe adoption of a P.R. system appeared probable.   Doubtlessowing,, however, to apprehensions of the increasing strength ofthe Socialists a compromise mixed system was introduced in1919 vvhich combined the block vote principle with a subordinateelement of minority representation.   The system secures thatscats are won outright by an absolute majority, but that where no list secures an absolute majority, tho results are determinedby proportional representation with a strong bias in favour ofthe party with the relatively largest pell.        ...A general election under this law took place in 1919.The party, managers appreciated the possibilities of the system,and the Anti-Socialists established a coalition of parties ofthe Right and Centre - the&apos; Republican Union - which&apos; made theissue in most.constituencies a two-party issue and thussecured the- Republican Union an absolute majority with a smallexcess of votes.   The result was that,- since the unified.Socialists only secured an absolute majority in twoconstituencies, their .seats almost entirely depended upon theP.R. element in the scheme,&apos;  and since in the constituencies in.which three-cornered contests took place they seldomsecured a relative majority, they were at a great disadvantagesThus, though largely increasing their poll, the Socialists ofthe Extreme Left lost between a half and a third of their seats
The unified Socialists who, in 1914,  polled 1,100,000  andcbtained ovor 100 scats, now polled 1,700,000 and,  nevertheless,secured no wore than 70 scats.          It appears clear that between the extremes of  the bloc combined in the Republican Union there existed widediversities of opinion which were only temporarily  united  by thecommon fear of Socialist success.
                   GERMANY,          In 1919 the German National Constituent Assembly waselected by a strict List system of P.R.   Over six parties were involved:   all the parties obtained representation, thefour largest parties to an extent roughly proportionate to their strength.   There was some under-reprosentation, e ,g. In thecase of the Minority Socialists,,- possibly because they put upcandidates in a number of constituencies in which they were wholly unsuccessful.   Under the system in force, unless a partypolled a quota of votes, the votes given for It were notreckoned.          This election did not give an absolute majority toany one party and a Government was formed of the three MiddleParties, of which the largest was the Majority Socialist,   Oneof the last acts of the Assembly was a new law for the election of the Reichstag.          The new law retained the P.R.&apos; List system with somemodifications :   it provided that a party should secure one&apos; seatfor every 60,000 votes recorded for Its list, the remainder ofthe votes being added together to obtain a national total for&apos;each party according to which certain additional seats were&quot;&quot;allotted. -  Remainders below: a certain figure were, however,excluded to discourage freak parties.          This law was put into force for the election of theReich3tag In 1920.  - The results exhibit certain movements in thepublic support of&quot; the- several parties which was accurately-reflected in the representation.  - In 1919, the MajoritySocialists polled 38$ of the votes and obtained 38.7$ in seats; &quot;&apos;in 1920, the same party polled 21.6$ of the votes and obtained22.2$ of the seats.   Similarly, the Democrats&apos;polled a reducedpercentage of the votes and secured an equivalent percentage ofthe seats.   The People&apos;s Party increased their poll from 4,4$&apos;\5% seats) to 13,9$ of votes giving them 14$ of the seats.Independent Socialists Increased their votes to 18^Q% giving them 19$ of the seats.
          The Communists, though polling in the aggregate the equivalent cf seven seats, obtained two only,  probably on accountof their remainders frequently not reaching the minimum necessaryto count for the additional seats.          As before, .nc one party obtained an absolute majority:;and again the iiajority Socialists were the largest party and thekiddle Parties in the ascendant..  The parties which supported the previous Government still commanded a majority, but a smallone;  and as they had loot heavily in public support they thoughtit necessary tc resign.          The largest party next te the Majority Socialists werethe Independent Socialiota, but  the latter would net co-operate with the former and the two parties would net, in any event,command a majority.   There had  on balance been a movement ofopinion to the Right  (notwithstanding the increased strength ofthe Independent Socialists);   and this movement was rewognisedin the formation of the new Government, which was based on thethree bourgeois Middle parties,  the Centre, the Democrats, andthe German People&apos;s Party.   It  is curious to note that whilethe last mentioned party  is frankly monarchist, the new Governmentbased in part upon its support expressed complete adherence tothe Republican principle.          The poll at the 1919 election was 83^ of the electorate;at the 1920  election, allowing for the exclusion of the plebiscite areas, etc. it was 80^.
                      ITALY.          The system in fores in Italy for seme years backhad been the single member constituency system coupled with the SecondBallot.   In 1912, when&apos; the electorate was increased from three to eight millions ty manhood suffrage, there was a movement infavour of P.R.j   and the question came up again in 1918 upona proposal to substitute the block vote system.   There appearedto be general consent that the single member constituency systemneeded to be amended.          In 1919, a P.R. measure was submitted to the Chamber,but opposed by the then Premier, Orlando, and .defeated.   Uponthe fall of Orlando, Nitti pledged the new Government toElectoral Reform, and a Bill instituting a List system cf P.R.was quickly passed by a very large majority.   This systemcomprised several novelties;  and was specially adapted  tc theneeds cf an illiterate electorate.   The first general electionunder this system was held in November, 1919, it being alsothe first general election held upon,the basis of manhoodsuffrage institUed in 19121  In 1920, full adult suffrage was introduced.          The outstanding feature cf this general election wasthe. lar-ge increase in the Socialist representation, the  officialSocialists, who numbered 52 in 1913, numbering 155 in. 1919.-  In-the industrial North this party polled in .great strength with amajority of votes over all other parties combined.  But  thesystem of P.R. in force permitted ether parties to obtain theirfair share cf seats..   The Catholic. Party, the P.P.I., scoredconsiderable successes; and the Socialists obtained., even in thenon-Socialist South, a degree of representation fairlyproportionate to their voting strength.          Of the Deputies who had served in  the last Chamberabout 300 out of 500 presented.themselves, and about a third ofthose were defeated, with the result  that a  large quantity of                        9 -
fresh, blood was infused into the Chamber.   Every partyendeavoured to include in their lists candidates from all sectionsof the community;  and for the first time in the history of thecountry the Chamber comprised about twenty genuine working-menmembers as distinct from the official Socialists and Catholics,          There is said to have been substantial abstentionfrom the poll, the number of Voters being between 30 and Q0%.In the industrial iMorth it was, however, between 70 and 80$,There are conflicting accounts as to the reasons for this abstention.
NEW SOUTH WALES.          The system in New South Wales prior to 19IS had been one of single member constituencies.   It had. however,  beenearly recognised that when the contest ceased to be one between two principal parties only - National - Liberals and Labour - theconsequences of the split vote would produce the usual results;and in 1910 oir Charles Wade introduced the Second Ballet tomeet this difficulty.   The result was hot, however, accordingto expectation.   The usual position was a three-cornered contestwith a National - Liberal candidate, a Labour candidate, and -anIndependent candidate.   As a result of the First Ballot theIndependent candidate would usually be eliminated; but upon aSecond Ballot his supporters would  transfer their votes to theLabour member through resentment against the National Liberal asnominee of the machine which had defeated the Independent; withthe result that, the Labour member secured eleotion in a districtnot predominantly Labour.   It was  recognised, therefore, thatthe device of the Second Ballot had, in the circumstances, failedto serve its purpose.          In 1918, a measure of Proportional Representation was introduced and.passed;  the Electoral Commissioners beinginstructed to group:&apos;adjacent electorates so as to makeconstituencies return five or three members&apos;..   The systeminstituted was that of the Single Transferable Vote, coupled witha provision for the compulsory expression of&apos; preferences.   Ageneral election took place in 1920 according to this system.          In addition to the three main parties,- a number cfsmaller parties (Independent Labour, Democrats, Socialists,Independents,. Soldiers) all entered the field.  As regards thethree largest parties the seats secured in each caBe ,were so
secured by an approximately identical number of votes perseat.   Independent juabour succeeded in three constituencies:the &quot;Independents&quot; in two:  but elsewhere their supporterswere too widely scattered to affect the result save through their late preferences,          According to the Australian press the numerous partiesmay be regarded in two groups - Labour and Anti-Labour.   Withthe official Labour Party are thus associated Independent Labour,Democrats and Socialists;   in the Anti-Labour combination,Nationalists are associated with Progressives, Independents andSoldiers.   Taking this grouping for what it is worth, theresults show that the two groups polled practically the same number of votes and obtained an equal number of seats.   the grouping is, however,, an artificial one,., and the independence ofthe Progressives was very early asserted in the new LegislativeAssembly.        ... The election was remarkable fcr an event unusual in aP.R. eleotion - the defeat of the Prime minister, Mr. Holman.   Ofthe. 9.0 members in the previous Assembly. 74 stood for re-election and 59 were successful, the new members  thus amounting to  one-third,         .. Owing to the compulsory preferences requirement, therewas an abnormal proportion of invalid votes.   The total polldid net exceed 56$ of  the whole.  &apos; There have been recriminationson the. subject of certain minor features of the scheme adaptedwhich are said to have indirectly influenced, the results;  andthe present Government is understood to have foreshadowed  further amendments in the electoral, system in its legislative programme.
