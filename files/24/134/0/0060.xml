            CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET.MMCKANTJUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN LORD CURZON  AND IZZET PASHA AT 1, CARLTQN HOUSE TERRACE             CM MARCH 18, 1922.     IZZET PASHA said he had little to add to his previous conversation.    His government desired  the friendship of&apos; Great Britain, but,  if they could  not obtain conditions more or less in conformity withthe national desires, no result was possible, evenif his government was to sign anything that we told them.-   He quoted the example of Perid&apos;s Cabinet.     Lord Curzon had said that some points of Izzefsprogramme could be accepted, and Izzet Pasha was grateful to hear this.   Others Lord Curzon had  saidcould be discussed;-  the Turkish government was ready.   Others Lord Curzon had declared could notbe granted;  the Turkish government was always ready for a compromise, but, if the British government de-parted too far from the Turkish desiderata, a solu-tion was impossible.   The situation was in Britishhands.     In regard to the Marmora, Izzet Pasha said  thathe himself was deeply engaged, and he repeated thatif the Greeks had a port there it was impossible forthe Turks to live at Constantinople.   They would accept a commission for the Straits and any practicalarrangements to ensure freedom, but they could not accept the Greeks as the guardians of the Dardanelles,     In regard to the Turkish army, arrangements might be made later for a force on a voluntary foot-
footing, but not at once.    The figures fixed  inLondon for the Turkish  army would,  on a voluntary basis, absorb two-thirds of the Turkish budget.  TheTurkish population too  was inflamed with  the  idea thatthe powers wished to keep the country in  a state ofpermanent debility.   Izzet Pasha therefore proposedthat some such clause as the following should  beaccepted:-     &quot;Until the Turkish budget can support the    &quot;voluntary system conscription will he per-    &quot;mitted0.    LORD CURZQN said that he had hoped His, Highnesswould to-day have been able to indicate the willing-ness of his government to accept the conditions dis-cussed at their previous meeting.   Lord  Curzon&apos;stask at Paris would have been easier if he had beenable to say that he had had three conversations with His Highness and that the Turkish government recognised the Justice of the case he had put forward.His Highness had been informed at the previous meeting that Lord Curzon was ready to use his influence withthe Greek government with a view to the  cessation  ofhostilities and a withdrawal from Asia Minor.   to effect this without further fighting was  surelyan enormous advantage to Turkey.   Lord  Curzon noted with disappointment that His Highness said nothing of this.   His Highness had repeated his  two pointsabout the Marmora and the Turkish army,  but he hadnot enabled Lord Curzon to speak more definitely                                               at
at paris about the Constantinople point of  view asa whole.   Lord Curzon himself had no change to. makein the propositions put forward at their previous meeting.   He would,  however,  beg His Highness  inthe interests of peace to consider these suggestions and to remember that they mark a considerable advance in the direction of peace.    It was surely  a verygreat advantage for the Turks  to gain their principalobject without further effort  and Hose, and, in viewof this, the Turkish government should not  adopt anuncompromising attitude on the other points. .     IZZET PASHA said that in  regard to the armisticehe would write to his government to do all  theycould.   Constantinople was already in a state  of armistice with the Greeks.    As to the other pointsunder discussion, his government wished to  be accom-accommodating.   Constantinople had no strength  to refusewhat might be imposed, but, if the conditions were too hard, even their acceptance was useless.   If theconditions were moderate the government of  Constanti-nople could be a factor for ensuring peace  in theEast.   In the contrary event, they had no  forceeither against the powers or against the Nationalists.
