The reports received  do  not record the  full  effect of  the lock-out in  theengineering trades, although an adverse result in industry in general is anticipated.In coal-mining there is, at present, improvement everywhere, but the steel and ironindustry is at a standstill.  In shipbuilding a dearth of new work continues.    The improvement in the cotton industry has been maintained, although  theposition in Scotland is not good.  There is no change to report  in the woollen trade,but jute and linen are bad in Scotland.  There is no change in the hosiery and lacetrade.    In general engineering the position is extremely difficult owing to the lock-out.In the pottery and china industry further improvement is shown, while there  are signs of decreasing activity in the  glass trade.  All branches of the wholesaleclothing trade  show  improvement,  and there has been considerable activity inseasonal trades painting, building and retail clothing.

[From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee,    The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920.  On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof the Cabinet,  when the  Cabinet  Unemployment  Committee  was  appointed  toconsider the whole question and devise means for relieving  unemployment.                       (A.)  Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was passed into law on the9th August, 1920, and came into operation on  the 8th November following.  TheAct applied comjralsory insurance against  unemployment to 12,000,000 persons ascompared with 4,000,000 previously.  Subsequent  amending Acts  modified  theconditions as regards rates of benefit and the amount thereof which could be drawn.Contributions were also increased and  authority given  to  borrow money from theTreasury up to  20,000,000.                   &apos;Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit and  the  contributions            during the period November 8, 1920, to March 11, 1922.
