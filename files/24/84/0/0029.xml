(THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF IHO ?JITiJH:3.CL MAMny 5,,GpMFi!,..S.EC. R FT. G.T. 7729.WAR CABINET.To Mini si ore gnl\.THff FINANCIAL SITUATION. &apos;1! (Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)&apos;The prime Minister has asked for a statement on the financial situation.   This is being prepared.   Meanwhile Ministers should see the attached statement relating to the current year.I need make no comment on the extreme gravity of the posi-tion.The Victory Loan has just closed.   It was required to meet the deficit on the year, but its main object was to fund Floating JDobt.   By an immense effort we have succeeded in raising  450,000,000 in cash.   Of this  250,000,000 is required to meet the deficit disclosed in the Budget Statement.   It is now apparent that the whole proceeds of the issue may be swallowed up by the excess of expenditure over the estimates for the current year.This is the road to ruin,   in the present temper of the public, whether richer or poorer, no further issue would have the least chance of success.   Every effort to secure support for the Loan was met by the cry of &quot;Government extravagance&quot;. ; The big money came in fairly well in spite of this.   The small man no longer subscribes, and the big man will not subscribe again if he sees his effort to restore sound finance stultified by new expenditure.I must beg all my colleagues to go again moet carefully into the expenditure of their Departments with a view&apos;to making reductions and to report to me as early as possible what economies can be effected.(initialled)   A.C.18th July, 1919.
The details given on the annexed sheet show an excess on the Original estimates of ipcpenditure of  210,000,-000- and on the Budget figures of expenditure (on the basis of a , 250.000,-000 deficit) of  134,000,000.It is very difficult to be sure at this.stage how the estimates will in fact&apos; work out, e.g. t&apos;t   what extent 5:icr,usce3 may be covered by savings; and the above figures must be given with all reserve.The great difficulty is the Army.    60,000.000 should be taking the darkest view; but it is impossible to place any reliance on the figure and to foretell the outcome so early in the year.The above estimates of increased expenditure do not of course give a complete picture of the probable Budget out-turn.(1) the &quot;Budget allows  20,000,000 ( and the attached state-ment  26,000,000 as in the supplementary estimate) for Coal. Sir A* Dickinson tells me that if the 6/- increase goes through as from July this will not all be needed - possibly there may be a saving of about  8,000,000 on this.   A delay of 3 months may alter this again - unless of course there is a great change in output.(2) the increased Beer Barrelage means an extra  15,000,000 in Revenue, according to the latest Customs figure.   Against this we must set any Budget concessions on Income Tax say  4,500,000.V &apos;. &apos; &apos; &apos;i.V  :.On these two items there may therefore be some  15,000,000 in hand.The result of the $ew Loan on the debt charge in-1919/20 canntt yet be calculated.   Owing to the effect of conversions on dividend dates and the fact that the first substantial dividend on Funding Loan is in May 1930, there may be a saving in 1919/20 (at the expense of 192Q/21).   But probably the sinking fund charge will about balance this,-   On the other hand we may have to borrow substantially for Death Duties.
Further, Miscellaneous Revenue ( 209,000,000) will he heavily down.   The Estimate allowed for some  90,000,000 for Food Assets..  The extension of Food Control weans that the Food Department instead of selling off and winding up &quot;by 31et March, 1920, will still he buying and holding stocks, the cash   value of which will not come in till later.   This means a deficit of some  70,000,000 at least.Munitions still expect to pay over their  67,000,000 in spite of some receipts bein-T in cold storage in France. On the whole, I think we ought to write off  80,000,000 in all from Miscellaneous Revenue for safety,   shipping Ministry may rather exceed their quota of  30,000,000.   Army and Navy may want their  15,000,000 themselves.   This would bring the additional deficit (over and above the Budget deficit of  250,000,000) to rather more than  200,000,000. Again at this period of the year it is most difficult to be certain.The above figures deal only with Budget expenditure. The various capital commitments (except Land Settlement for which the Budget provides) do not affect the figures. Electricity and Transport Borrowings would be &quot;below the line&quot;; and Housing Loan3 fall on the Local Loans Fund.Balance.Increased expenditure 134,000,000Decreased Receipts 84,500,000Less additional Beer duty15,000,000 203,500,000
