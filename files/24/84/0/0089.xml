,4 oThis Document is the Property of ,                 I *SECRET.    Hi^t B/Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government \jo v&quot;&apos;Circulated by the Secretary of State for Iiidia-wM Cabinet Papei .T. 7656.O.lave received a copy of the Directorate of Intelligence Special Report No erstand that this was circulated as the result of the recommendations of a Iimittee presided over by Lord Gurzon, of which I was not a member. I do not wish to appear ungrateful to Scotland Yard for its services with regard to revolutionary matters, but it somewhat astonishes me that a paper of far more importance to India than to England should be circulated-to the Cabinet without reference to the India Office.As regards the facts in the document, I have only to say that in certain details, mainly minor, the report appears to me to be inaccurate. I have also to say that in so far as the report is political, it suffers from the perspective which one Would expect from a political review compiled by those especially interested in the detection and control of criminal activities.There are certain statements, particularly at the end of paragraph 2J, against which I protest most emphatically, and there are certain descriptions of individuals which to my mind are distorted and fantastic.I would add that in so far as the policy deliberately- adopted by the Government becomes antagonistic to the convictions of Indian Mohammedans, they must be expected to agitate with all their strength against such a policy.As regards the remedy, I hope the Cabin ot before coining to any conclusion will allow me to consult tho Government of India. It does not commend itself to me at first sight.E. S. M.23rd July 1919.SS157   15  7/19
