R YThe ocal and the food questions are looming so large in the public mind that all other causes of unrest have sunk temporarily into insignifioanoe, and agitators, who are working on the questions of intervention in Russia and direot action, find it rather difficult to obtain listeners.There has been a great deal of underground manipulation about the demonstrations and the one day strike arranged simultaneously with the French and the Italians for July 21st.    It is believed that strikes in this country will not be widespread, though the demonstrations will be well attended.The most serious faotor at the moment is the growth of jdlsoontent among discharged soldiers.    The extreme Labour Societies are doing their best to work upon this discontent.$  A young Norwegian, posing as a correspondent of a Socialist jnewspaper, is believed to have supplied money to Miss Sylvia JPankhurst for the purpose of Bolshevik propaganda.    Enquiries and Ian examination of his papers oonfirm the report, and steps are being taken to send him back to Norway.
THfl POLIGHlMembers of the Polioe Union who met in the Holbom Stadium on July 13th, passed a resolution defying the Government to establish an internal organization in place of the present union and pledging themselves to fight for &quot;justice&quot; for ex-Police Constable $paokman. Several Labour Organizations have expressed sympathy, and many Labour JSxtremists have promised the Polioe the support of Labour, though the trend of their speeches shows that they hope in return to aeoure the assistance of policemen in their election to Munioipal bodies.    In Prance the polioe have proved to be useful election agents.It is too early.to foretell the effeot  of the publication of Lord Desborough&apos;s report, but it cannot -fail to affect the already declining membership of the Union adversely to the prospects of the agitation.Some 6000 members of the Paris Polioe passed, on July 11th, a resolution demanding, inter alia, the abolition of the decree of militarisation of the Police :*    and the establishment of a disciplinary oounoil.    They are for the most part old soldiers and are inferior in training and selection to the London force:   their conditions of Service also are far less favourable.They demand a reply by. June 20th, the eve of the general strike,AHTI^IHTERTOTIOMi IN RUSSIA. . :&apos;  Strenuous efforts are being made by labour organisations to ensure successful demonstrations on July 20th and 21st. The demonstrations, which   post little, will probably be well attended, but the majority of workers object to. losing a day*s wages;   only the Merthyr miners, have announced their intention/
intention of striking.Ehe British Sooialist Party is evidently disoouraged and has issued an appeal in whioh it protests against &quot;mere demonstrations&quot;, and urges a strike on the Frenoh and Italian lines.J. Bromley, General Secretary of the Associated Sooiel of Looomotive Engineers and Firemen, considers that July 2 will be a test day for labour&apos;s power and will prove or disprove the solidarity of labour.It is reported that in France there is vigorous apposition to a strike from printers, railway workers and building operatives.An incident whioh seems to have been Ignored by labour generally is not  uninteresting,    M.  Bienstok, representative of the Russian Mensheviks at the Berne and Amsterdam Conferences, sent on July 1st an Open Letter to tt Exeoutive Committee of the Labour Party, oommending the demonstration against intervention, but urging that it shoul be dissociated from support of the Soviet regime.    He urge! the demonstrators to &quot;summon the Russian Soviet Government 1 stop Its reactionary and antidemocratic policy in the interior of Russia, and to restore all democratic liberties and give the Russian people, and particularly the working olasses, the rigit of self-determination&quot;.THB COST OF LIVING.Profiteering and the alleged mis-management of food supplies arc largely oooupying the minds of the workers ani the public generally, partly as a result of the Press campaign.    &quot;Th e Daily Herald&quot; has. as usual, done its best to foster unrest by distorting any available information. Apart, however, from the Press/there is evidence that h prioes are causing grave discontent.
It is impossible to exaggerate the effeot on the workers; of the declaration that the price of coal will be inoreased,  .6s. per ton.    Reports from all parts of the oountry indicatethat workers regard the announcement aB a politioal stratagem, With a double objects... : (a)  To influence the general publio againstnationalization of the mines.(b)  To discredit the Labour candidates at Bothwell and Swansea,Mr. Smillie voioed the general opinion at Bellshill onJuly 11th:-WI believe that it (the 6s.) was deliberately done because the Swansea and Bothwell bye-elections were inprogress, and being fought by Labour.......  We believe thatthe statement was made deliberately to divide the workers here on the nationalization of the mines&quot;.Protests more or less violent have been made in . ...  Lanarkshire, Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, South Wales, .. Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire . er^ and.Lancashire,    Some bodies, suoh as the London Trades Council, representing some 130,000 London artisans, reoommend direot action as the only method of influencing the Government in the . matter of coal prices.Sections of railwaymen threaten that they will refuse to handle coal at the increased prioe and my correspondent reports that workers in the Tyneside dockyards intend to demand, an increase of wages.PEACE CMBBRATI0N8 &apos; ,,,:yr\,h*-h&apos;The efforts of Labour leaders to organise opposition to peaoe oelebratiofcs ore meeting with some suooess, particularly amongst discharged Service men.At North Shieldsi Sheffield, Barnsley. Halifax, Huddersfield and Liverpool, ex-soldiers are refusing toparticipate./
participate..Bradford has abandoned.a procession and pageant in consequence of the attitude of disoharged men and labour; i &quot;k     Stoke-on-Trent and at Nottingham opposition demonstration^ are to be held.At Barrow disoharged men are organising public meetings for July 16th and 18th to protest against &quot;the wanton waste publio money, whilst soldiers and sailors are starving1&apos;.THE PRINCE m WALES.Ity correspondent reports that the reoent visit of the prince to South Wales was a great personal triumph.    This . faot is realised by the extremists who did their utmost to make the visit unpleasant.    In addition to general failure however, they suffered the mortification of seeing half their stauhohest supporters &quot;turn yellow&quot;.A(&amp;ICuXTURAL Y/OHKBRS,My correspondent reports that the feeling amongst agricultural workers in Nottin^iamshire is unsettled and -tbsj opinion is rapidly veering towards direct action. [WOOLWICH.i Ik ore is increasing unrest in the Woolwich area, whioh receives an impetus from the continuous discharges from the Arsenal. The Communist Party is active in the dlstriot, eft speakers usually assert that a revolution is coming, one of them going so far as to fix the date for next November. Speoimens of leaflets oiroulated by the Communist Party shon that there is no lack of funds.CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS. iThere is a movement for mobilising the oonsoientious objeotors for a olass war, under the standard of Mrs, Swanfli . ..,  a woman of German origin, who was prominent in the militantsuffragette/
suffragette movement.    Discussing the olass war in &quot;The Tribunal&quot;, Mr. Hunter says that &quot;Violent aotion oannot be defended from the standpoint of principle&quot;. 1THE E1DEFEKDENT LABOUR PARTY.The aotivity of this Party is oontinuout; during the week about forty meetings have been held.    The audiences, however, are not always sympathetic.   At altringham on July 5th David Kirkwood was vigorously opposed,and on July 6th ex-private C.J, Simmonds was so severely heokled by discharged soldiers at Gwaenoaegurwen Common that the meeting ended in uproar.THE) HERALD IB AGUE?.The Herald League seems to be extending its platform; during the week meetings have been addressed by the Indian, Bhaduri, and a Colonial whose name is believed to be Webster.Victor Beeoham, one of the leaders, met with considerable opposition when speaking on &quot;The Advantages of Bolshevism&quot; on July 10th.NATIONAL FEDERATION OP DISCHARGED AND DEMOBILIZED BAILORS AND SOLDIERS.The feeling in this organization is becoming bitter,though great satisfaction is expressed with Sir Douglas Haig^sevidenoe before the Select Committee on Pensions.    Complaintsthat pensions are inadequate are increasing, and mycorrespondent reports that in Liverpool the opinion is thatthe Government negleots the men for whom it has no furtheruse.The Longton branch, whioh has a membership of about 800, oomplains that looal employers have refused to re-instate members in their former jobs.In lancashire 67,000 ex-servioe men are-reported to beunemployed.DOCKERS1/
DOCKERS * uitionDuring the oonferenoe on 9th July strong attaoka-wert madoupon the existing transport, system, which, it was. alleged, is responsible for the congestion in the docks. Mr. Ben Tillett said that 400 trains, composed of 50 truck taoh, were carrying traffio whioh before the war w&amp;s   . 1*oarried by coastal shipping.The &quot;class-consciousness&quot; of labour was emphasised a resolution which protested against &quot;the mal-administrative of the Ministry of Labour by the dumping of University and other middle-class persons into important offices under the Ministry, to the exclusion of experienced and compete? labour representatives in direct touch with the industrial olasses&quot;.Mr, mmvmrnvy !h;pw action&quot;.In the ourrent issue of the Journal of the Iron Founders1 Trade Union, Mr. Arthur Henderson comments sanely on the question of using industrial action for political purposes.&quot;To endeavour to force upon the country and upon taa Government by illegitimate means the polioy of a section of the entire community - it may only be a minority of the oommunity - involves the abrogation of Parliamentary Government, establishes the dictatorship of the minority, and might easily destroy eventually all our constitution liberties. Labour, by taking such a oourse, might be tl author of a doubtful precedent to-day, aftd its victim to-morrow.&quot;Miss Pankhurst is continuing her mischievous aotivf Being in great need of money, she made an appeal to Xwdwil Martens, the head of the Bolshevik Party in America, tosend/
m(English) ...      : - 7 ,v-^/^--^send her as much as he could spare, but she hae1 now received-from Stookholia&apos; by the hands of a young man posing as a journalist a sum of  300.    This young man, Axel Zaohariass+n by name, professes to be a reporter for a Socialist news-paper, but enquiries and examination of his papers show that he is a Bolshevik emissary.    He is being sent back to Norway forthwith, there being no means of dealing with him under the existing law.Mise 0&apos;Heill, the Irishwoman who was oonvioted of ? /insulting beheyipvr in Hyde Park and sentenced to eleven days&apos; imprisonment on Jpth Juno, was to have addressed a meeting of the Herald League.at - SiiHbury Park on July 13th, but appeared instead at Saatbourne, in company with ex**Inspeotor Syme.    She made an extremely revolutionary speeoh and advocated the overthrow of the Monarohy.    The audience of about 300 was,sympathetic and my correspondent heard such ,,,, remarks as:- &quot;We all think the same as she does, but we are afraid to stand up and say so&quot; and &quot;Why should she be sent to prison for saying, what is ri$it?&quot;&quot;ffHff wTpHyBfl?&apos;1&apos;- DREADNOUGHT&quot;..This paper, after muoh difficulty, has found a printer at 14, Little Howland Street, W.I., where the &quot;Herald of Revolt&quot; and &quot;The Industrial Worker&quot; were formerly printed. This printing press was sold by Freitag to some Belgians, who printed a Belgian paper on it during the war,IRELAND.The final signing of Peace without any referenoe to Ireland hae no doubt proved a severe blow to the Sinn Fein oause, whose leaders are now trying to keep up enthusiasmby/

Father 0&apos;Flanagan is now on a round -agricultural lectures in Galway and Mayo and seems to be -adhering to bis undertaking to avoid politics.    As he is &quot; Relieved tohWe made peace with his Bishop and to be -returning to hie Fariefa duties, Sinn Fein appears likely to lose one of its few orators of any conspicuous ability.
