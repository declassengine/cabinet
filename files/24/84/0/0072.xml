&apos;  v,it 210WAR   CABINET.CONTROL   OF   HAY.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF MUNITIONS,The Board of Trade (G.T. 7675) recommend a modified formof control whioh would probably defeat its own ends.   It would result in a sorious charge on the Treasury unloso the hay proposed to be purchased under Clauses 1 (home) and 3 (overseas) were re-sold at such a price as would almost certainly lay the Government open to a charge of profiteering *I fail to understand the statement   made by the Board of Trade that the Central Council has performed its work most sat-isfactorily.   This body really represents the interests of Traders and my information is that it has shown no special competence in.carrying out its functions.   If tho Forage Depart-ment with its military organisation of 480 officers and 20,000 ^ranlc and file has boon unable&apos; under War conditions to suppress illicit trading in forage, there is not tho remotest chance that the Central Council will be able to make the proposed new scheme of control work-..The Board of Agriculturers memorandum (G..T. 7704j shov;s that &apos; it is only the fear of control that prevents the importation of hay.The note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (G.To 7720) sums up the commonsonso of the problem.   I agree with every word of it.July 23rd, 1919. I.oOo
