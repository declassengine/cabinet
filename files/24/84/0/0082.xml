/c3 258---^wresult of the decision of the War Cabinet in July 1917,that bread should be sold at the rate of 9d. pdr 4-lb. loaf,, and of their subsequent decision that all flour, except flour used for industrial and other &quot;precluded&quot; purposes, should be subsidised, the maximum prices of flour and bread were fixed by the Flour &amp; Bread (Prices) Order 1917.Since the issue of this Order, Bakers1 costs have steadily in-creased, and in addition to increases in the cost of fuel, yeast &amp;c., there have been substantial advances in wages.During last winter the Master Bakers made urgent representations that they could not under prevailing conditions produce the 9d. loaf with a reasonable margin of profit, and demanded an adjustment in the price, either of flour or of bread.   After full investigation, I informed the Trade early in February last, that, in my opinion, they had not made out a good case for any general adjustment in prices. I was satisfied in my own mind, however, that they would be unable to bear any further appreciable increase in costs.The Operative Bayers have now formulated, under threat of a general strike on August 2nd certain demands which, if granted, must result in a material increase in costs.   The Master Bakers who, as a protest against my decision, have absented themselves from meetings of the Joint Industrial Council since February last, threaten not to resume attendance, and will probably refuse to enter into negotiate ions of any kind with regard to these demands. Such a course of act-forced upon them by the attitude of the Masters.   with a view to safeguarding the bread supply, I have urged upon the National Assoc-It is necessary, however, that the Cabinet should give an immed-late decision as to the action that they would desire adopted if the result of these negotiations should lead to an increase in&apos;the cost of production, necessitating either a reduction in the price of flour or an increase in the price of bread.A reduction in the wholesale selling price.of flour would involveion can only result in a general strike of Operatives, which will beiation of Master Bakers that they should enter into negotiations.
serious increase in the amount of the Bread Subsidy, for eachshilling per sack is&apos;equivalent approximately to   2,100,000 p.a.and the principle once being admitted that the increased cost ofsubsidyproduction does not fall upon the consumer, but is met by a State/at the expense of the taxpayer, the Operative Bakers would be encouraged to make further claims and the Master Bakers would have little incen-tive to resist them.By advancing the price of bread rather than reducing the price of flour the adjustment necessitated by the increased cost of pro** duction due to concessions to the Operatives would be borne by the consumer, and would be strictly confined to the article produced. A reduction in the price of flour, on the other hand, would result in the taxpayer having to bear an increase in the subsidy equivalent to the reduction in the price of flour used not only in the manufacture of loaf bread but also for the manufacture of flour, confectionery, and all domestic purposes, including home breadmaking. Of the total annual consumption of flour - say 42 million sacks - it is estimated that approximately 25 million sacks are used by Bakers in the manu-facturo of loaf bread.I recommend accordingly,(1) that the Cabinet should decide that any further material increase in the cost of production of bread should be met by increasing the price to the consumer rather than by increasing the subsidy to the taxpayer.(2) that this decision should be made public.It is, of course, possible that the Master Bakers, so long asthey feel assured that an increase in the cost of production will bemade good to them, may make unnecessary concessions to the operatives,even though this involves an increase in the price.of bread to thepublic. I think, therefore it would probably be desirable that thequestion of further concessions to labour should be dealt with by anofficial award of an arbitration tribunal, and that any increase inthe price of bread should only be admitted where there has been suchan official award.In view of the fact that a national stoppage of baking is threatenedfor August 2nd, an immediate decision on the point here submitted isnecessary.Ministry of Food, GE0v H. ROBERTS.24th july, 1919.
