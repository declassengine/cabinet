EXCLUSION OF GERMANS MM COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES.At the War Cabinet Meeting No.559 (Minute 3) held on the 23rd April 1919, it was decided to suspend the draft despatch which had been prepared in the Colonial Office inviting all Colonies and Protectorates to legislate without delay with a view to prohibiting Germans from entering, residing, or trading locally in their territory for a period of five years from the end of the far, and to leave the matter in abeyance until the conclusion of Peace.    Peace with Germany having now been signed, it becomes necessary to consider what policy in the matter should be pursued;   and a decision on this question is the more urgent in view of a tele-gram received from Lord Burton with regard to a proposed Ordinance in Rhodesia, of which I circulate copiesK.C.for S.A..Tum&apos;19... herewith.The reajonafor a policy of exclusion - the risk of Germans fomenting disloyalty, the danger to the Germans themselves, the importance of restoring our oversea trade without being hampered by the competition of our late enemies, the disastrous effect on the native mind of the return of the Germans whom he has seen ignominiously removed - are set out in far cabinet memorandum
Memorandum (G.T.6583).    They are of an obvious character and it appears unnecessary to elaborate them&apos; here.    I would, however, observe that ryot^ng has occurred since the Armistice which would Uad me Yc suppose that public opinion in the Ooloni.es and Protectorates on the question has in any wa*j altered; and if the Governors were consulted I feol sure that there would be a general consensus of opinion that the unrestricted return of immigration of Germans could only be attended by grave internal disorders and possibly even bloodshed.    In the case of Hongjcong for instance, the British community have threatened to throw th6 Germans into the harbour if they return, and there is similar evidence of strong feeling in other Colonies. To allow the Germans back in the face of overwhelming local sentiment of this kind, would, I think, involve a real risk of ugly incidents which might lead to con-si considerable   diplomatic embarrassment.On the other hand, the reasons against a policy of permanent exclusion are equally obvious, and as sron as Germany is admitted to the League of Nations it will 1 $resume, be necessary to give German nationals equal privileges with those of other States.The solution which I would propose of this very difficult problem is that the Colonies and Protectorates should be invited to pass legislation under which the local Government would have a free hand in keeping out Germans without laying down as a principle that all Germans must be excluded.    This might be attained by requiring any subject of a State lately at war with Hie Majesty to have a permit signed by the Colonial Secretary of the Colony or Protectorate which he wishedto
(Mb   Wto enter before he oould enter such Colony or Protec-torate.    This legislation, I would further pfoopose, should be limited to a term of thrae years.    Such a solution would avoid the difficulty of excluding Germans and other enemy subjects nominatim: and on the other hand it would in practice enable the local Government to exclude any ex-enemy aliens, wherever such a courseprohibit such a solution.    Under Article 220 we reserve to ourselves the rigftt to repatriate any German national whom we may desire to repatriate, but this presumably only applies to Germans residing in British Colonies or Protectorates before the War,    As to the treatment of Germans seeking such a domicile after the War, the Treaty appears to be silent;   under Article 276 Germany under -takes not to subject the nationals of the Allied and Associated Powers to any prohibition in regard to the exercise of occupations, professions, trade and industries which shall not be equally applicable to all aliens without exception, but the Allies have not given any similar undertaking on their part, which presumably leave:? them free to make any regulations that they please,and Protectorates, but I would propose that a similar policy should be applied to mandated territory of which this country receives the ma&amp;date.    Article 122 of the Treaty of  . Peace provides that -&quot;The Government exercising authority over such territories (late German Oversea possessions) may make such provisions as it thinks fit with reference to the repatriation from them of German nationals and to the conditions upon which German subjects of European origin shall, or shall not;; be allowed to reside, hold property, trade or exercise a profession in them&quot;.So far I have dealt only with British OjGoloniesThe
The Dominions will, of course, follow theirown policy in this matter, but whatever decision, we arrive at we ought, as a matter of infom&amp;tuui, &quot;to communicate at once to the Dominions Crovet-mutate. Canada has already, legislated in a very drastic manner under an Order in Council recently issued of which ICanada 0. in C. . 9 June.,-circulate copies herewith.M. 14.7.
TELEGRAM from the High Con-Bidosicner for South Africa to theSecretary &quot;of State for the Colonies. (Received Colonial Office 8.30 p,n,, 28th June, 1919, )Legislative Council Southern Rhodesia has passed Ordinance empowering Administrator after declaration of peace to declare as undesirable inhabitants and therefore liable to be dealt with as prohibited immigrant under Ordinance VII 1914 any subject of a State at present at war with His Majesty excepting Czecho Slavs and Jugo Slavs, Ordinance to come into operation on declaration of peace and to endure unless sooner xa^to repealed for one year. Early in April I ti33&amp; Administrator that any important amend-ment of Ordinance VII 1914 for the future to the exclusion of enemy subjects should await in my opinion conclusion of Treatyof Peace which might possibly contain relevant provisions,0rdi-su^raitted        .,        - - .      ,   ,        &quot; \ , nance now wsAs&amp;m to me is understood to be intended as arrange- -ment whereby entry from Union of any enemy subject who is notbeing repatriated by Union Government may be prevented until gen-oral policy with regard to whole question has been determinedPopular feeling in Rhodesia against enemy subjects is very strong and I think their eaalusion is probably desirable in their own interests.  Unless&apos; you see objection would therefore propose toassent to Ordinance&quot; on condition that Administrator will undertaketo procure its immediate repeal or amendment by LegislativeCouncil if before its expiration its provisions should involveconflict with any terms of Treaty of Peace, Should action byLegislative Council prove impracticable owing to dissolution orfor other reasons.I could presumably supersede Ordinance by pro-clamaticn see pur despatch 13th August&quot; 1909 No.296 and I would obtain from hia assurance that should necessity arise he would raise ric objection to such action on my part.
