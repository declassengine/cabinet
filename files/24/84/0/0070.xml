The situation is quiet but land communications are still cut off from Riga and Libau, the Germans not having withdrawn from Latvia.   German evacuation has not yet begun through Libau. The military mission are talcing steps to ensure as far as possible  , that evacuation when commenced is carried out without armed conflict With Letts., which is considered probable.Government is established at Riga and the situation is i$r proving daily.      Arrangements for re-organising the Landwehr is  (\ progressing favourably.    Patrol encounters between Germans and Letts continue, and reports have been received that Germans are concentrating towards Mitau, but the3o have not been confirmed.

Paris is now discussing the question of the blockade of the Gulf of Finland and preventing trade by neutral countries with Soviet Ruasia.Admiralty has informed S.N.O., Baltic, that Swedish ships should be turned back, not seized, giving danger from mines as reason for such action.A regular steamer service between Stettin and Finland is reported to have been started by the s.s.&quot;TORNEA&quot; of the Finska Angfartygs.A Polish Shipping League has been established in Warsaw to promote Polish shipping, organise a Polish mercantile fleet, extend shipping on the Vistula and strengthen Polish influence in Danzig Harbour.NORTHERN     RUSSIA,Archangel,     G.O.C. reports on July 13th that both the Dwina and Pinega rivers are still going down, the latter being now almost impossible for any kind of craft, making water transport situation most difficult.On the 11th instant a successful raid was carried out jsy Russian troops on the left bank of Selmenga, when 16 prisoners and 1 machine gun were captured and some enemy blockhouses were , set on fire.   The R,A.F.has lost several machines lately through crashing on landing.On July 14th seaplane &quot;Fairy&quot; 3 C Ho.9249 came down in enemy lines, pilot and observer are missing.   18 seaplanes will ]?o ready for despatch to Archangel from Killingholme on July 23rd. \ : A Naval Kite Balloon has arrived and is working with the flotilla on the Dwinai    Many floating enemy mines are being picked up   !-daily.

On 13th July, 500 Bolsheviks under Spiridonoff attacked garrison at Tivdiya 11 miles S.W, of Kyapeselga.   The attack was beaten off after 1\ hours fighting with considerable I033 to enemy, who retired South burning bridges.    We had no casualties.An enemy 6U gun bombarded post held by Russian troops 6 miles S,S, of Kyaposclga and later attacked with 300 men. TheJ post was vacated and 5 men are reported missing.

KfMEDITERRANEAN.H.M.3. &quot;CAHADA&quot; carrying demobili3able men has arrived in England and&quot;ST.GEORGE&quot; and &quot;PYRAMUS&quot; are on their way home.     ,..  \lAdmiral Sinclair reports that the anti-French feeling which led to the murder of French and Annamite troops at Fiume was due chiefly to the complete failure of the Italians to check -fantastic outbursts against the Allies and chiefly the French, on public platforms, notably by Signqr Mussolini, and in the Press.     He is of opinion that there was little or no French provocation.
The members of the Commission of Enquiry areGeneral NAULIN (French) General SUMMERALL (American) General D35 ROBILANT (Italian). The British member has not yet been appointed.An expression of the thanks of Admiral Ronarch and the French Navy to Admiral Sinclair for having arranged that the two French destroyers at Fiume should be placed alongside &quot;Cardiff&quot; during the riots, has been received.Exercises have been carried out by &quot;2.46&quot; in the Bosphorus to discover whether a submarine could proceed submerged through the Bosphorus from the Black Sea to the Marmora without being discovered.It was found that the enterprise would undoubtedly be one attended by almost prohibitive risk, especially if an efficient surface patrol at the Northern end of the Bosphorus and look-outs at Anadolu, Kavak, and between Chibuklu and Kandili were established.The area approaching Mersina and Alexandretta i3 now reported clear of mines except within 10 miles radius  rom Karadash Burnu Light, 4 miles radius from Ras el Khanzir and a strip running from Karadash Bumu 4 miles wide from the foreshore round the northern shores of the Gulf of Iskanderum to within 6 miles of Alexandretta.The French have done some minesweeping in Junie Bay where a small minefield had been reported.Vice-Admiral Sir John M. de Robeck, GOMG., KCB., having been selected to succeed Vice-Admiral the Hon.   Sir Somerset A.Gough Calthorpe, GCMG., KCB., CVO., as C.in C. inVthe Mediterranean, directions have been given for his/flag to be hoisted in H.M.S. &quot;President&quot; on 28th Ju% 1919/ his &quot;personal attendan&amp;ce being dispensed with, and to be struck at Sunset on the same day.Vice-Admiral ftc Robeck will then be regarded as on leave of absence until he proceeds abroad to take up the command.This appointment   is to take effect from 26th July,1919.The Aegean Command has been extended as far along the Karamanian Coast as 510 30&apos; East in view of the Dodecanese Command recently created by the Italian Admiralty.BLACK SEA. &amp; DANUBEDenikin hopes to establish line Saratov-Tambov-Voronej-Kur3k by the end of this month although he expects heavy resistance, and, if successful he proposes to start an offensive against Nijni Novgorod and Moscow, protecting his flanks on the Desna and Dnieper rivers. &apos; He already holds the Dnieper, from Berislavl to Verkhnednyeprovsk and has ordered that Nikolaieff is to be seized if local risings against Bolsheviks make such seizure possible by small force, in which case he will request the   assistance of the British fleet.The advance x.: rthwards is proceeding slowly. Bolshevik W/T states that Grigorieff has been assassinated at Odessa but there i3 no confirmation of this.It is reported that the French intend to U3e VAHMA as a base for supplying their Danube Army;   - They are at present using Galatz and Braila, but say the Roumanian attitude ren-/ ders this difficult.   It is believed the real reason for the change i3 fear of Roumanian Bolshevism spreading through their troops.Thse two Bulgarian torpedo boats taken by the French, Which have been at Constanza or Galatz for some time past, have now returned to Varna, and will be based there. .....The French colonial troops who were reported to have landed at Varna, have moved up to Lorn Palanka and Szegedin.
CASPIAN.D&apos; nikin&apos;s forces at Tzaritsin have crossed the Volga and occupied the small torn of Tzarev, practically due east  of Tzaritsin.The advance on Astrakhan from S.Weat is not progressing favourably.   Astrakhan is reported to be in the hands of anti-Bolshevik workmen,   Mairrbody of garrison are working down coast and with aid of landings have forced the Volunteer Army to withdraw to Tarnovskaya.    It is doubtful whether this advance can be checked.   Denikin fears that an attempt will be ma de to join up with sympathisers in Azerbaijan and Daghestan and to bring about a Bolshevist rising which will threaten the Grozni-Petrovsk and Petrovsk-Baku railways.   Prom the Sastern side the Ural Cossacks are reported to be about 6.0 versts from Astrakhan.   The position of the Bolshevik fleet is not known, about half is, thought to have proceeded up the Volga above Tzaritsin before the fall of that town, the exact whereabouts of the remainder is doubtful, but believed to be between Tzaritsin amd Astrakhan.,The C.in C. Mediterranean has been informed that the Italians are taking no active steps to relieve us in the Caucasus and Caspian, and therefore he is to commence forthwith to hand over the Caspian Squadron, and all naval material to. Denikin.     All British naval personnel are to be ready &quot;by 15th August to leave Baku for Batoum.   It is fully realised that if Astrakhan has not been captured before 15th August the command of the Caspian will probably pa3S into the hands of the Bolsheviks.The Italian naval authorities have been informed that the Caspian Squadron is now being handed over to Denikin.Rear Admiral, Black Sea, has sailed in MS,&quot;EMPIilROR 01 INDIA&quot; for Batoum, presumably to organise our withdrawal.RED,.SEA. .,All is reported quiet at Jeddah and IbmSaud has made nofurthor advance.   .. CHINA. :^^^^Admiralty, has informed C; in C. China that all Naval personnel is to bd. withdrawn at same time as Military and embarked in &quot;CARLISLE&quot; and that there is no objection to Officers and Petty Officers remaining with Admiral Kolchak if he es so wishes and they desire to do so.     All other Officers and Men to be sent to England by first opportunity.H.M.S, &quot;Kent&quot; is- on her way home.     The retreat of Admiral Koltchak&apos;3 forces continues and the Hampshire Regiment have been withdrawn.ffORTH AMERICA &amp; !W33T I2TDI1S. -&apos;-Cin C will proceed in H.II.S. &quot;Cambrian&quot; which recently left -the Azores for Trinidad to relieve &quot;Dartmouth&quot;, to Halifax in time to meet H.R.H. the Prince of Wales there.
