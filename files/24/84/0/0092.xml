The Miners&apos; Federation Conference.The Annual Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, which opened at Keswick on the 15th July and continued till the 18th, was invested with special importance owing partly to the general gravity of the existing coal situation, and partly to the decision which it was obliged to take with regard to the conditional offer of the Government, made on the 14th July, to defer the proposed increase in the price of coal for three months if the Labour Party would engage that there should be no strikes or stoppages, and if the miners would do their best to increase output.From a survey of the proceedings at the conference, it immediately becomes evident that there were four features of outstanding significance. The first was the decision of the conference to reject the Government^ offer, the second the defeat of the attempt to obtain authority for the Federation^ Executive to declare.a national strike without consulting the districts, the third the concern felt by the conference at the prevalence of unauthorised strikes, and the fourth their resolution with regard to piece-rates. These points merit attention in some detail.
(1) It was fairly clear from Mr. Smillie&apos;s presidential address on the 16th that the Federation, following his lead, would not be inclined to regard with favour the acceptance of the Government&apos;s oiler. Mr. Smillie devoted a large part of his speech to a discussion of the findings of the Coal Commission, and in particular to the agitation in the country with regard to nationalisation. He insisted that they had certainly understood from&apos; the Prime Minister that if the inquiry of the Coal Commission produced facts to justify the majority in recommending nationalisation of the mines, the Government would consider it their duty to carry out the finding of the Commission. But at the present time they were witnessing an example of &quot; direct, action &quot; in the House of Commons, taken by the possessing class, the land owners, the mine owners, and the great commercial interests, using the whole of their political influence to prevent the nationalisation of the mines. Further, two by-elections were pending in mining constituencies, and he was convinced that the announcement of the 6s. per ton increase in price was a political move on some-body^ part in order to turn the opinion of the nation against the miners. The miners wanted a full inquiry to ascertain if the 6s. increase was necessary, for they did not forget that when the Government increased the price by 2s. 6d. per ton they got  25,000,000 profit as the result. With regard to output, he asserted that the Miners&apos; Federation was as anxious as any member of the Government to have the fullest possible output, and he denied that the miners were to blame for the reduction in output. If as a result of an inquiry it were found that the miners were to blame, the whole power of the Federation would be used to put matters right, but if the employers were to blame they should be brought to book. It was not possible to get miners to do as much work in seven hours as they did in eight, but they believed that the output could be enormously increased under nationalisation, with resulting proper development, an extended use of machinery, and the elimination of dictatorial royalty-owners. In conclusion, he stated that he wished to assure the Government that if they would act on the recommendations of the second Sankey Report, the miners would be behind them in fighting any organisation of employers. Mr. Smillie&apos;s attitude, thus clearly stated, was reflected in a resolution passed unanimously by the conference, informing the Government that they were prepared to give it their fullest support in carrying the recommendations of the Majority Report of the Commission into immediate effect.After Mr. Smillie&apos;s emphatic insistence that the problems of nationalisation and increased production were indissolubly bound together, no doubt could be entertained as to the decision that the conference would adopt with regard to the definite offer of the Government. The keynote( of the discussion was again struck by Mr. Smillie, who main-tained that the Government ought to have given some indication as to whether or not they intended to carry out the findings of the Commission, and it was not too much to ask that the Government should give a pledge that they were going to deal seriously with the problem of nationalisation. He had no doubt that if they got such a pledge, the miners were prepared to set about a reorganisation of the industry on more intelligent lines than it had been carried on, and do what they could to increase the output. But under the present system of management, and in view of the general uncertainty that&apos; existed, it was not possible to increase the output to any great extent. Mr. G. Spencer, M.P., Mr. W. Brace, M.P., and Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P., then spoke in favour of an acceptance of the Governments offer. They pointed out the disastrous effect that the rise in the price of coal would have on the industries of the country, and urged the conference to have regard to the nation as a whole, and the effect of their action on public opinion. These,considerations, however, appear to have had little weight with the conference, which passed practically unanimously a resolution proposed by Mr. Frank Hodges, the General Secretary of the Federation, in the following terms : &quot; This Annual Conference, having heard the report of the miners&apos; members of Parliament upon the discussion in the House of Commons on the Governmenfs proposal to raise the price of coal by 6s. per ton, declares that the increase is not necessary, and should be avoided. It regards the problem as one of production only. It is of opinion that production can only be increased to a point which will make the industry self-supporting, without additional charges to the consumer, if the economies set forth in the first Sankey Report are effected and the recommendations of the majority of the Commissioners as to an immediate change of ownership and control in the mining industry be passed into law. It therefore informs the Government that it is prepared to co-operate with the Government to the fullest extent to put such economies into effect, and the recommendations into law.&quot;With regard to this decision of the Conference on the Governmenfs proposal, the opinion has been expressed that it should not be regarded as final, and that successful negotiations may still take place. The resolution in which the Governmenfs offer was rejected was the decision of a delegate meeting which was without instructions from the
districts on the question at issue, and its authority cannot therefore be regarded as--complete. It is pointed out that if the suspicion in the minds of the &quot;miners that Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s offer was merely an attempt to postpone a Cabinet decision on nationalisation be dispelled, and if the Prime Minister were to give an undertaking that the Government would decide the question definitely within a limited time, and couple this with an appeal to the miners to do their part in refraining from striking and in increasing output during that limited period, the Executive Committee of the Federation would have to refer the matter for consideration to the districts,- and a special conference or ballot or both would take place, and in this way the deliberate judgment of the miners would be obtained. It is clear, however, that the extent to which the miners&apos; strikes in Yorkshire and else-where have gone, and the consequent necessary action of the Government have combined to render more remote the prospect of an amicable agreement being reached.(2) The defeat of the attempt to authorise the Executive Committee of the Federation to declare a strike without taking a ballot of the members was apparently somewhat of a surprise, and is interesting as an indication that the rank and file are inclined to distrust a policy which gives practically unlimited powers to the Executive. The resolution making this proposal was moved by Mr. Warne, Northumberland, and was couched in the following terms : &quot; That on any question of national importance or on any other question already agreed to-by a national conference of. miners, the Executive Committee or,a conference of the Federation may call the miners out on strike without a ballot vote if the conference or committee desire to do so.&quot; Mr. Warne urged in favour of the resolution that new machinery was needed to meet new circumstances that were going to arise. The Federa-tion had joined the Triple Alliance, and it was not desirable that in a crisis they should have to stand peacefully waiting until a ballot had been taken. Mr. J. E. Sutton, Lan-cashire, opposed the resolution on the ground that it was not democratic but autocratic, and Mr. W. Brace, M.P., characterised it as reactionary, and insisted that he objected to be controlled by an oligarchy of his own class. Other delegates spoke against the proposal, and it was rejected by a large majority.With reference to this&apos;decision it may be pointed out that when the Federation was formed more than 30 years ago, the founders agreed that before a national strike could be declared, it must be endorsed on a ballot vote by a two-thirds majority of the members voting. In recent years the extremists have made several unsuccessful attempts to give the Executive or a National Conference power to call a national strike ; and the latest effort is certainly not unconnected with the fact that the National Union of Railway men, with which the Federation is associated in the Triple Alliance, have the power to call a strike without -a ballot, and thus, so far as they are concerned, to put into immediate effect any decision of the Triple Alliance with regard to direct action.(3) The anxiety of the Conference with regard to the disciplinary aspect of unauthorised-rised strikes was displayed in a long discussion, introduced by Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P., on the action of South Wales surfacemen in striking against the hours of work fixed by the Sankey Award, which resulted in the following resolution, carried with few dis-sentients : &quot;This conference learns with regret that certain surface workers have stopped work because of local disputes as to the hours of labour. The Conference calls upon*all surface workers to observe loyally the award of the interim report of Mr. Justice Sankey.,. according to the decision of the ballot vote of the members.&quot; Mr. Smillie pointed out that it was ridiculous to insist on the Government carrying out the recommendations of the Sankey Report, and in the same breath to support men who refused to carry out certain of its provisions. To have men striking against conditions accepted by a ballot vote of all the members would destroy the Federation.It is reported that many of the miners&apos; leaders view with much alarm the prevalence of unofficial strikes, and freely admit that the men are, in some cases, getting out of hand.(4) The resolution on piece-rates, which the Conference passed in private session, was in the following terms : &quot; This Conference decides that the maximum figure to be accepted in any given district for the reduction of one hour per shift be 14-3 per cent, with a proportionate increase for every fractional part of an hour reduction, provided that such increase in rates shall not mean an increase in actual wages. This Conference in-structs the Executive Committee to acquaint the Government with this decision, and to obtain an interview with the object of settlement on the above basis. In the meanwhile, all districts are requested to continue working until instructed to the contrary.&quot; This resolution has a double significance. In the first place it renders definite the miners&apos; point of view with regard to the decision of the Government that any increase of piece-rates over 12^- per cent, must come out of guaranteed profits ; and in the second place it refuses to countenance the claim of the Yorkshire miners for a general increase of 14-3 per cent., irrespective of the actual reduction in hours that has taken place.   In certain
districts in Yorkshire the previous working time was less than eight hours, and to give these workmen the full 14* 3 per cent, increase would give then an increase in actual wage. This the Federation, in spite of the arguments of the Yorkshire representatives,.would not sanction.A general summary of the proceedings of the Conference appears in Part IV of the (last and the current issues of this Report.Paet II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.Women&apos;s Welfare under the Ministry of Labour.The welfare work conducted under the Ministry of Munitions in connection with women workers rapidly changed in character after the armistice. But with the trans-ference of the Labour Departments of the Ministry of Munitions to the Ministry of Labour there proved to be much that remained necessary for the continuation of this work, and in some directions for its expansion.The welfare officers&apos; supervision of conditions in the factories which had been engaged on munitions work came to an end with the cessation of hostilities. The welfare officers visiting factories during the period following the armistice were occupied principally with the questions arising out of the discharge of women workers, with arrangements for their transport to their homes or to other work, and in general, with winding up their work. These operations still continue, but as they are complete in any factory, the supervision of women&apos;s welfare is handed over to the Home Office, with which depart-ment the care of these workers will remain in future. One fact, however, has emerged prominently in the course of this intra-mural welfare work, namely, that welfare work is not required solely in factories and workshops. The range of women&apos;s occupations is remarkably wide, and many women, as for example, those engaged on ship-cleaning or on railway work in stores, warehouses, or on salvage dumps, do not come within the scope of the Factory Acts. The continued or extended supervision of welfare among such women is a matter which will require careful consideration for the future.In one direction the intra-mural work of the Ministry of Munitions is being continued under the Ministry of Labour. The panel of candidates approved for welfare supervisors, which was maintained by the Ministry of Munitions, has established for itself a reputation both as affording a standard test of qualifications and as the most trustworthy source from which officers of this type might be drawn. Candidates have continued to apply for admission to the panel, while at the same time firms in search of welfare supervisors have continued to ask for the submission of candidates from this list. The panel has therefore been maintained, and candidates are still recommended by the Ministry .of Labour from among those registered on it.It is evident .that the impetus given during the war to welfare work among women is &quot;still continued. The large dismissals of women following on the armistice naturally led in many cases to the cessation of welfare work. The financial inducement, which prevailed in war-time, to undertake this work by offsetting its cost in assessment under the excess profits tax, has ceased to exist except in the case of recreation work. But it is clear that in the majority of cases where women employees remain in large numbers, welfare work is continued, and new firms are adopting measures for the welfare of their workers and appointing supervisors. In a number of cases where the whole of the women workers have been discharged, the welfare supervisors have been retained to carry on first aid work, canteen management, or other similar duties for the male employees, and in some cases have been directly admitted to share in the management of the firm. Complete statistics of the number of welfare supervisors are not available, as the field of intra-mural welfare with which the Ministry of Labour is associated is limited. But it is known that the figure is at least ten times as large as in the period immediately preceding the war. The prejudice which in some cases existed among the workers has clearly been broken do\yi in many directions. The secretary of one of the South Wales trade unions recently expressed the opinion that legislation on the subject was necessary and that every firm should be legally obliged to employ welfare supervisors.While intra-mural welfare, in the main, has not passed under the care of the Ministry of Labour, the extra-mural work has retained all its former importance. The welfare officers of the Ministry have been called on to deal with a great number of individual cases of distress, and the maintenance of the sickness and emergency fund has made it possible for them to deal with cases in which financial help, as well as other assistance,
is necessary. The cases dealt with are of all characters. The list ranges from cases where women were being made to pay income tax for periods when they had not been in work, to the provision of lodgings for the night&apos; for stranded workers, or the making of arrange-ments for children whose mothers were for the time being not in a position to support them. The class of case most numerous is probably that of the worker suffering from illness arising out of. her employment, in which there is often delay in awarding compensation, and consequent suffering or destitution. The discharge of: munition workers in large numbers often brought about travelling difficulties which the welfare officers were called on to overcome, and while this work has naturally been inter-intermittent and the pressure is now relaxed, it was necessary to deal with it adequately and promptly.The work of the welfare officers in connection with recreation is still in full progress. The efforts of the Home Office during the war to deal with ,the problem of recreation for juveniles by calling into being local juvenile organisation committees was hampered in part by the lack of local officers and in part by the fact that no financial resources were available. The Ministry of Munitions had to deal with recreation for juveniles as well as for adults, and there was therefore some risk that the activities of the Departments might overlap. At the same time, in the welfare officers it had command of the local officials necessary for the work, and financial resources were also available. The cost of recreation schemes approved by the Ministry of Munitions might be deducted in making returns for excess profits tax, and the grant of  6,000 by the Maharajah of Scindia placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Munitions a fund which could be applied to this as to other welfare work among munition workers. The fusion of forces by the Home Office and the Ministry of Munitions was sufficient to set the movement on its feet. It is not too much to claim for the welfare officers that it was largely by their services that the Juvenile Organisation Committees have been able to make their work a success. The movement for the provision of recreation shows no sign of slackening. The provision as regards assessment for excess profits still holds good for the lifetime of the excess profits tax, and a -small sum still remains from the Maharajah&apos;s fund which, however, for the most part is being used to settle the outstanding accounts of recreation clubs whose membership and subscriptions have ceased to exist. The Juvenile Organisa-tion Committees and their recreation work are now on the point of transference from the Home Office to the Board of Education. This involves, perhaps, some slight risk that recreation for adults may be overlooked. But the risk is minimised by the fact that the terms of the Education Act allow of the inclusion of all persons under 18 who still receive instruction of any land, and recreation in many cases is elastic enough to include lectures and other quasi-educational activities. In close connection with welfare were the Hostel and Pood Sections of the Ministry of Munitions, the welfare officers being frequently required to inspect both hostels and canteens. Experience has shown that such inspection is essential if a proper standard is to be maintained, and the demand on the part of the workers for adequate facilities for meals to be obtained in reasonable comfort is to be met. The effect of the provision of industrial canteens upon the health of the workers  and particularly of the women-is a matter of vital importance; while the present difficulties of housing are forcing many firms to consider the provision of hostels for their employees-a provision open to many dangers and abuses without expert supervision.Finally, mention may be made of the continuance by the Ministry of Labour of the activities commenced under the Ministry of Munitions as regards lodging accommodation. Sanction was obtained under the latter Ministry for the appointment of lodgings investi-gators, who were mainly concerned with the discovery of suitable lodgings, and the maintenance of registers of such accommodation, and who also dealt with numerous cases of sickness or difficulty arising among imported workers in lodgings. The power to appoint such investigators was transferred to the Ministry of Labour, and a small number have been employed. Recent events have shown the wisdom of this provision in view of the acuteness of the housing problem. The firms in certain congested areas, as for instance Carlisle, are calling for women&apos;s labour, which it is necessary to import, and the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour refuses to take steps for the importation of such labour where it is not assured that adequate accommodation can be provided. The development of the Government training schemes, with the consequent concentration of women workers in certain centres, is also expected to raise the same problem and to call for the activities of the lodgings investigators of the Ministry of Labour.
Part III. Pkess Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.Russia.In view of the near approach,, when the papers reviewed this week were written, of: the international demonstrations, the co-ordinating purpose of which was to protest against Allied intervention in Russia, there is. in these papers an abundance of material on Russia. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; sums up the I.L.P. position on the Russian issue in an article which takes the form almost of a displayed advertisement. The struggle of the Russian people for freedom through long years of oppression is referred to. The history of the 1905 revolution is dealt with in more detail. It is alleged that at that time &quot; our governing classes were in cordial relationship with the Tsar and the governing classes of Russia&quot;; and the facts are emphasised that no &quot;white papers&quot; on the &quot; atrocities of Tsardom &quot; were then published, no expedition was sent to Russia to unseat the Tsar and no financial or material aid was given to the movement for freedom. From the 1905 revolution the article jumps to the March 1917 revolution, which, it is suggested, was successful because, &quot; when the capitalists plunged the world into war,&quot; they created the conditions which made a successful revolution possible. The difference between the two revolutions of 1917 is stated thus: the March revolution was a political movement which just dethroned the Tsar, while the November revolution was an economic movement &quot; which shook the foundations of world capitalism.&quot; Because of the fear which seized them (&quot; they saw in the triumph of Socialism in Russia, the defeat of Capitalism else-where &quot;) the article suggests that the capitalists determined at all costs to prevent the success of the economic revolution. This determination has resulted, therefore, in the Allies making war upon it, not by declaring war but by supporting with the equipment of war the &quot; disgraceful work &quot; of Koltchak and Deniken, &quot; who desire to overthrow the revolution and to restore the old regime of autocratic tyranny.&quot; It is stated that the Russian Government has made repeated efforts to secure peace and has offered large concessions in return for it. Finally, in bold lettering, this article insists that the cause of the British worker is one with the cause of the Russian worker and that the &quot; war on Russia &quot; is an attempt to murder Russian freedom and is thus a war on democracy and socialism. Special articles are also contributed to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; on this question by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, Mr. Joseph King and Mr. J. T. Walton Newbold, M.A. Mr. King deals with Press propaganda hostile to the Russian revolution and suggests that it is financed by the Government. In particular, he deals with Mr. H. V. Keeling&apos;s recent book on Bolshevism and Mr. E. H. Hayward&apos;s preface to it. He describes Mr. Haywood&apos;s statement that the Bolshevists suppressed the Co-operative Societies as a notorious inaccuracy. He maintains that the serious charges against the Soviets contained in the book (conscription, Government spying., restriction of free travel and trade, bureaucratic decrees) can be met with equanimity, because they can be made also against the Allied Governments. In conclusion, Mr. King makes out a list of 20 nations which he alleges have (or, at least, lately had) men on Russian soil; &quot; let it not be said there is no League of Nations already there is a great league to set up Koltchak as Tsar or Dictator of all the Russias.&quot; While the article which has been mentioned above would seem to attribute the Allies&apos; hostility to the Moscow Government to the peculiar economic character of the November revolution, Mr. King and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald maintain that from the beginning of the March revolution Russia has been an outcast among the nations. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald&apos;s special thesis, indeed, is that the Allies&apos; aim in Russia is to establish a military tyranny and that they are hostile not only to Bolshevists but to all Socialists. In sup-porting the Russian Revolution he asserts that he is not necessarily taking sides either for or against Soviets, but he wishes for Bolshevism to be tested by the free operation of political opinion and experience in Russia. Lenin he regards as a man who may possibly prove a 20th century Rousseau, and therefore who is too valuable a man to be overthrown and destroyed. He thinks ^that the danger of a &quot; War Office triumph &quot; over Bolshevism is still very great and therefore calls for some great popular demonstration and if this &quot;be not altogether free from evidence of impatience and anger, so much the better.&quot; Mr. Walton Newbold expresses the opinion that, though the fear of a successful experiment in Socialism might be an explanation of the &quot; persistent attack on Russian Socialism &quot; by the Allied Governments, the interests of Allied capitalists in the exploitation of the mineral riches of Russia are, an equally potent cause of intervention.  He quotes from the
&apos;&quot; Petroleum World &quot; to- show how interested shareholders in Russian, oil companies are in the course of the fighting on or near their concessions.  He concludes that the battle being fought in Russia between Bolshevists and Koltchak and Deniken is essentially a battle between capitalism and the working class.  Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; suggests that it is the desire of the &quot;capitalist masters of Great Britain &quot; to get the millions of Russian people to work cheaply for them and thus bring the workers here to their senses, that is the cause of the intervention.   &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; reviews both Mr. Keeling&apos;s book.on Russia and Mr. Ransome&apos;s.   &quot;Rob Roy&quot; regards Mr. Keeling&apos;s book as an authentic record of facts, whereas Mr. King regards it as a mere item of hostile propaganda.   Mr. Ransome, thinks &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; has selected his topics so as to give an unduly roseate account of Bolshevik rule.   He contrasts Mr. Ransome&apos;s story of the Bolshevik policy towards the trade unions with Mr. Keeling&apos;s own experiences ; and explains the difference by supposing that Mr. Keeling treats of detailed realities, while Mr. Riansome was only told in vague phrases of general programmes.   &quot; Rob Roy &quot; concludes by warning his readers against &quot; current idealisations of the latest form of tyranny.&quot;  Mr. M. Philips Price contributes to the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; the first instalment of a series of historical articles, which he courageously entitles &quot; The Truth about Russia.&quot;   This paper also publishes a message from Mr. Robert Minor who, in the knowledge he gained during a nine months&apos; stay in Russia last year, confidently states that the invasion of the Russian Republic is a fouler crime than tiie invasion of Belgium. The third contribution the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; makes this week to the elucidation of the Russian problem is a .reprint of &quot;An open letter to Lenin,&quot; sent to him from the &quot; inaugural meeting of the Finnish Communist Party, held, in Moscow, 3rd September, 1918.&quot;  Mr. Walton Newbold gives examples in &quot; The Call &quot; of the Scottish commercial interests in Russia, which amplify the statements he makes in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; but &quot;The Call&quot; as a whole is less interested in the intrinsic importance of the Russian question than in the demonstrations and strikes about Russia.   The &quot; New Statesman &quot; maintains that while Bolshevism may be an enemy of capitalism, it is much more seriously an enemy of every form of reasonable Socialism.   Lenin&apos;s greatest triumph, in the opinion of this paper, is the panic he has created in Western Europe. &quot; The only strength of Bolshevism lies in the fact that in face of the attacks of Koltchak, Deniken and the Allies, the Bolshevik junta can successfully pose as the defenders of the revolution.&quot; Therefore this paper recommends a withdrawal of British troops and material from Russia.   &quot; Russia can only be liberated and pacified by a movement which embodies the spirit of proletarian freedom.&quot;International Russia Demonstrations.It is characteristic of the difference in policy between the I.L.P. and the B.S.P. that these demonstrations proposed for the 20th and 21st July are only referred to in I.L.P. papers as secondary to, and different from, the Russian question. - Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thinks it is.well for Labour&apos;s first great International demonstration that it should be upon this Russian question and thus be a demand for the control of Russian policy. The B.S.P. attitude, as shown in &quot; The Call,&quot; is one of approval of the demonstrations for their own sake as an actual part of the revolutionary movement for an International Socialist Co-operative Commonwealth. Mr. John Bryan, in this paper, declares the demonstrations will mark the &quot;constitution of the international working class,&apos;&apos; which has hitherto been an ideal rather than a reality. This transformation he attributes to the genius and daring of the Russian Bolshevik revolution. Mr. Bryan shares the opinion of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; that Allied intervention in Russia serves to help the Soviet regime : the demonstrations are therefore in his opinion not at all necessary to save Russia, but are significant rather as a proof of the consciousness of the world proletariat that its salvation depends upon the maintenance and universal adoption of the Soviet regime. Mr. Robert Williams also contributes a composite article to &quot; The Call&quot; in which he warns the &quot; mandarins of the British Trade Union movement not to hold themselves in undue conceit in the apparent hey-day of their influence,&quot; and expresses the opinion that Bolshevism (which is &quot;simply Socialism with the supreme courage of its convictions &quot;) is going to be supreme not only in Russia and Hungary but also in Germany. He does not make his appeal to the Trade Union officials (&quot;they tend to become an excrescence and parasitic growth like a form of cancer &quot;) but to the &quot; men and women who do the nation&apos;s work,&quot; and expresses the opinion that if they only have the intelligence to grasp the importance of the Bolshevik revolution, and the courage to act upon their knowledge, they will have the power to compel the &quot; cowardly politicians ;to take their bloodstained hands from the throat of the Russian Soviet Republic.&quot;  The
&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; takes credit for itself for the fact that it has been the only-journal to urge a protest strike in England, on 21st July, and Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thinks it is regrettable that the English Trade Unions did not decide to fall into line with the working classes of Italy and France, &quot; who are stopping work on the 21st July.&quot;The Trial of the ex-Kaiser *Contributions to the discussion of this topic are made by those papers which did not refer to the matter last week. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; expresses the opinion that the announcement of this trial has greatly alarmed the &quot; friends of the Coalition &quot;&apos; because a trial will mean revelations by which the &quot;old diplomacy &quot; will stand exposed and condemned. This paper prefers the American policy, &quot; which has substituted business for bitterness.&quot; &quot; Justice &quot; thinks that a far more important thing than the trial, is to keep the ex-Kaiser from doing, or being used for, further mischief. The &quot; New Age &quot; hopes,, on all grounds, that the trial will not take place. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; confesses it is doubtful whether, with the death sentence ruled out, we shall have such a serious trial as the occasion demands,f and if the accused be found guilty, we shall be able to inflict a punishment which will at once suit the crime and yet preclude the possibility of the criminal coming to be &quot;regarded as a martyr.Other.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; publishes extracts from Italian journals of the 4th July or thereabouts on the establishment of &quot; workers&apos; councils &quot; in certain Italian towns in the course of the recent food-price riots. Dr. F. C. Conybeare continues, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; his articles on the causes of the outbreak of the war. The &quot; Democrat &quot; publishes the opinion of Mr. Charles E. Russell (of the American Alliance for Labour and Democracy)&apos; on the League of Nations. The &quot; Nation &quot; considers the position created by the raising of the blockade.*(B) Home Affairs.Goal Industry.The announcement of the increase in the price of coal by 6s. per ton, which is dealt with for the first time in the papers reviewed this week, is the cause of much discussion.. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is despondent.   &quot; For five years the policy of successive Govern-ments has been to live from hand to mouth and to hide the real situation from public knowledge by subterfuges and artificial tricks.&quot;     Wages have been increased beyond the capacity of industry to bear the strain without such a reorganisation of the various industries as would give a compensating increase of output and would secure economies in working expenses.&quot;   The state of affairs in the coal industry, considers this paper, is but one instance of the general condition of national trade and finance, but the decision to raise the price of coal has brought the nation up against the hard facts of the situation, and has sobered the country in its reckless prodigality.   The Government is criticised for making no adequate arrangements for the reconstruction of our industries and for &quot; spending  1,000,000 per week in unemployment doles &quot; instead of providing work to increase the real wealth of the country.   With regard to the coal industry, this paper-thinks increased output is the remedy, but to secure increased output a thorough re-organisation of the coal industry is necessary.   &quot; The miners are willing to do their part,, but the Government must be made to do theirs, or go.&quot;  Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the same paper, discusses the Governments decision and maintains that it has no justification whatever.&apos;  The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; regards the decision as &quot; a declaration of war upon organised labour,&quot; and proceeds to attack the coal royalty owners, urging the workers to go on with their demands and to destroy the wage system.  This it thinks can be done by a combination of Fabian Socialism and Guild Socialism.  The particular complaint of this paper is that not one word has been said by the Government with regard to the attitude it proposes to adopt on the Coal Commission^ recommendation in favour of State ownership of minerals.   The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; thinks that nationalisation would render most of the advance unnecessary and regards it as a proof that the Govern-ment is intending to break its pledge to adopt the first Sankey Report &quot; in the spirit as well as in the letter.&quot;   &quot;The Call&quot; thinks that the increase shows how thoroughly capitalistic the Government is and that the increase has been made in order to smash, the miners and their drganisation.   &quot; If the coal industry were owned by the community* Of. Report, 16th July, p. 43. f Cf. opinion of &quot; New Statesman &quot; (ibid., p. 44).
such increases would be unnecessary.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; would appear to believe that the Government has also refused to nationalise the mines, railways and docks (&quot; all of which it has promised &quot;). It regards this action as a splendid opportunity for advancing the struggle against Capitalism and recommends the advanced men in South Wales to pursue their scheme for socialising the coal industry and securing control. The &quot; Nation &quot; expresses the opinion that Nationalisation would not have much effect upon the output of the mines, and suggests that the real remedy lies in a more economical method both of winning and using coal. The &quot; Nation &quot; also considers that there is some danger of so strongly a placed body of workers as the miners exploiting their position, not merely at the expense of royalty owners and mine owners, but at the expense also of their fellow-workers. This danger may be remedied, in the opinion of the Nation, by the preparation and publication of reliable wage and other statistics, &quot; upon which the National Industrial Council should be engaged.&quot; The &quot;New Statesman&quot; thinks that the figures produced by the Government are disgracefully slipshod. &quot; Justice &quot; thinks there is need to go into the matter of national fuel economy. Mr. W. A. Appleton, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; deals with the effects of the increase on our coal export and iron and steel trades and our commercial and financial position generally. &quot; Yesterday we lived on our savings and earnings; to-day we are living on credit; to-morrow, if we live at all, we shall be living on charity.&quot; The verdict of the &quot; Clarion &quot; is that &quot; on the issue forced upon us by the Government, we are bound to stand by the miners.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; thinks it is a little disingenuous to pretend that nationalisation of the coal industry will effect a material reduction in the selling price of coal. This paper thinks the nationalisation of the industry at the present time would merely aggravate the present situation, and not only would the public pay more for its coal, but that the miners would pay more for the getting of it. The &quot; New Age &quot;has no love for the Sankey Report and regrets the fact that the miners seem to desire its adoption by the Government.Prices and Profiteering.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &apos;,f Labour Leader,&quot; acknowledges that certain factors which are responsible for the rise in prices are beyond our control, but he maintains that a large measure of the rise is due to the fact that the trading community has discovered that the public can be robbed. He thinks the remedy lies with the consumer, who must follow his advice and boycott the profiteers until they are willing to accept a reasonable price for their goods. &quot; The Call &quot; deals with the prices of food, and suggests that the Russians have shown the workers how to deal with the situation. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals with the causes of the present rise in prices, and attributes part of it to failure of transport and part to a failure of the system of commercial distribution. This paper points to the fact that it cannot now be assumed that any commodity will be sold for no more than its cost of production, and suggests that the &quot; Price War &quot; is in reality a struggle between the property owning and employing class and the wage earning class, as to who shall pay for the cost of the war. The remedy proposed is to adopt in each industry that is left in private hands the system that was introduced during the war for the making of khaki and army clothing. The &quot; Clarion &quot; maintains that the only way to cure profiteering is to amend the system by the introduction of control in order to safeguard prices from the operations of trusts and combines. The &quot; New Age &quot; insists that the present high level of prices cannot be due either to the phenomenon of profiteering, to the shortage of supplies, or to the present high-level of money wages. Therefore, this paper does not recommend any violent measures against profiteering as likely to reduce the level of prices and in particular criticises the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; for recommending such a course. Its nostrum to cure high prices would appear to be a manipulation of the oredit system, but having preserved its individuality by categorically denying most of the current explanations of high prices, it is content with a somewhat obscure sketch of the remedy it proposes.Peace Celebrations.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; observes with pleasure that it has received the impression that there is no popular enthusiasm for the Peace Celebrations on the 19th July, and concludes that, in the circumstances, they are assuming the form of the &quot; burial ceremony of the hopes of all who supported the war to make an end of war.&quot; Mr. Philip Frankford informs the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; that he can only rejoice when the social revolution has banished capitalism and militarism and proclaimed the socialist republic. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; is greatly concerned because the local shop assistants have had to sacrifice their Thursday half-holiday, and is disappointed in them for &quot; allowing themselves to be played with &quot; in this manner.
The Cotton Strike.Mr. Joe Terrett deals, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; with the Cotton Strike and rejoices that these thousands of Britain&apos;s best workers have secured more humane working hours and higher remuneration, but the burden of his article is that the average spinner is no Bol-shevist. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; thinks that the end of the strike marks the biggest move forward in economic and industrial progress the cotton operatives have ever made. It regards the obtaining of a statutory 48-hour week as an especially valuable con-tribution to the national movement for a 48-hour week, but it does not show any lack of appreciation for the increased rates of wages. This paper also reviews the i trade outlook in the cotton industry. It has no fear of Japanese competition, and sug-gests that American competition, which it thinks possible in view of the two-shift system which is alleged to be prevalent in Massachusetts and the ineffectiveness there of the 48-hour week, should be met by a closer International Trade Union organisation to raise the conditions of workers who are being unduly exploited. It is stated that the making of a 48-hour week the statutory working week in Massachusetts, and the prospect of this stan-dard being adopted internationally, had some influence on the Lancashire shorter hours movement. The article concludes by expressing a desire for a more aggressive spirit on the part of both employers and employed in regard to cotton growing within the Empire.Nationalisation.Mr. H. W. Lee contributes an article to &quot; Justice &quot; in which he maintains that Govern-ment methods are utterly unsuited to the management of any industry, and expresses the opinion that the nationalisation of industry under the control of Government Depart-ments as they exist at present would be a hazardous experiment and the cause of much discredit to socialism. Government Departments must first, be transformed and the workers must receive more education in socialism, before a policy of nationalisation can be recommended by Mr. Lee as a policy for socialists to pursue. In &quot; Forward,&quot; Mr. J. K. Murray discusses the history of land tenures in Scotland and gives a glossary of such terms as&quot; Blench Holding of Blench Farm,&quot; apparently with a view to furthering the campaign for the nationalisation of land in Scotland. The &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; summarizes and criticises the arguments against nationalisation which the Central Land Owners&apos; Association has recently circulated.Other.In &quot; The Call &quot; Mr. J. F. Hodgson discusses &quot; Parliamentarism and Trade Unionism &quot; and expresses his firm conviction that the war is to be followed quickly by world-revolution. * Mr. S. Howard Withey contributes to &quot; Justice &quot; an article on &quot; Industrial Unionism and Crafts,&quot; and.argues that, on grounds of economic theory, Labour unionism should base itself on the commodity produced for sale. Mr. J. T. Walton Newbold discusses, in &quot; For-ward,&quot; et Capitalism in Scotland,&quot; Mr. Charles Jesson, M.P., continues in the &quot; British Citizen &quot; his studies on &quot; Industrial Unrest,&quot; and the &quot; Democrat&quot; emphasises (the importance of education as a preventive of revolution.(2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Out-of-WorJc Donation.The &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; (17th inst.) reported that the Grand Jury at Fermanagh (Ireland) had passed a resolution calling the attention of the Government to the demoralis-ing effect of the out-of-work donation in most Irish towns. The donation was said to be encouraging men to idle away their time in hatching sedition and mischief. It was sug-gested that the donation should only be given to men who had been engaged in actual&apos; fighting, and that all payments should be supervised by the police. The &quot; Belfast News Letter &quot; (12th inst.) reported that at a meeting of the Council of the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union, complaints were made that the &quot; unemployment dole &quot; encouraged men to refuse to take higher paid work, and so farmers were having difficulty in finding the necessary labour to gather in the harvest. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; (17th inst.) supports the view that it is the duty of the employer to notify vacancies to the Exchanges, and not of the men to go from place to place to seek jobs. The &quot; Democrat &quot; (18th inst.) attributes unemployment donation frauds to a widespread but erroneous belief that the donation pay comes from a source external to the worker and not, through taxation, from all those who are working and thus earning a wage.   This paper also condemns Government schemes* Cf. Reports, 2nd July, p. 8; 18th June, p. 7; 11th June, p. C.
to provide work for the unemployed as at present undesirable until we have built up our export trade and until the foreign exchange is at a normal level.The Demobilised Man and the Trade Unions.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; (19th July) discusses the discontent among ex-soldieis, and defends trade unions against some of the charges that have been made against them, and suggests that the industrial system under which we live is not built upon a basis which encourages either generosity or justice.*Training of Disabled Soldiers.The &quot; Nottingham Gf-uardian &quot; (16th inst.) reported that at a meeting of the Midland Federation of Lace and Embroidery Manufacturers in Nottingham on Tuesday, the 15th inst., the opinion was expressed that it was useless to train a twisthand in less than 18 months. It used&apos;to be thought that four years were necessary. Most of the schemes for training disabled soldiers had not been a success, and it was not anticipated that many of these men would go into the lace trade.Past IV. General Topics and District Reports. (1) General-Topics.Direct Action,The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress held a special meeting on the 22nd July to consider the resolution passed at the Labour Party Conference at Southport suggesting that the Parliamentary Committee should convene a special con-ference with reference to direct action in connection with intervention in Russia and conscription. The committee came to the conclusion, in view of the fact that the annual meeting of the Trade Union Congress will be held on the 8th September, that it was not desirable to convene a special conference, but that on the opening day of the annual meeting of the Congress an emergency resolution would be submitted to the delegates on the question of conscription.A delegate conference of the Triple Alliance was held at Caxton Hall on the 23rd July with regard to the steps to be taken to compel the Government to comply with the demands formulated originally some months ago. The conference, which consisted of 300 officials and delegates of the three organisations, was presided over by Mr. Smillie, and sat in private. At the conclusion, it was announced by Mr. Hodges that the following resolution had been carried by 217 votes to 11: &quot; That this conference of the Triple Alliance, having noted that the Parliamentary Committee has again refused to convene a special conference of the trade union movement to enable that movement to decide whether it was prepared to take action to compel the Government to abolish conscription, to discontinue military intervention in Russia and military intervention in trade unicn disputes at home, decides to recommend its constituent bodies to take steps in accordance with their respective constitutions to ascertain whether their members are prepared to take industrial action to enforce these demands. Where a ballot is required in more than one of the constituent bodies, a ballot paper be prepared by the sub-committee for submission to a vote of the members.&quot;It may be pointed out that by the constitution of the Miners&apos; Federation and the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, a ballot is necessary before the declaration of a national strike, but the National Union of Railway men has power to declare a national strike through its executive.Nationalisation and the Coal Situation.The situation with regard to the coal mines is becoming more complicated, due in part, from the Labour standpoint, to the decision of the Miners&apos; Conference on the 17th July to reject the Governments conditional offer to postpone the increase in the price of coal, and to the growing evidence, supplied by the surfacemen&apos;s strike in South Wales and the strike in Yorkshire and elsewhere, that the rank and file of the miners are getting out of hand and showing an intractable spirit which the Federation seems unable to curb. The situation in the coalfields is dealt with in Part V of this Report.
Resolutions against nationalisation recently reported have been passed by Newry and Londonderry Chambers of Commerce and other bodies. The increase in the price of coal by 6s. per ton has been protested against by the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators, Kidderminster Chamber of Commerce, Plymouth Co-operative Society, Camborne branch of the N.U.R., the General Executive Committee of the National Union of Cokemen and By-product Workers, the Manton (Worksop) branch of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, the Tanfield Lea Lodge of the -Durham Miners&apos; Association, Bristol Miners, and other organisations.Miners&apos; Federation Conference.The Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, which opened at Keswick on the 15th July, concluded on the 18th. A summary of the proceedings on the 15th, 16th and 17th July was given in last week&apos;s Report. On the 18th July the conference devoted itself for the most part to the adoption of resolutions having as their object various improvements in working conditions. The Executives were instructed to take steps to complete the standardisation of wages and conditions of work, in order that the method of dealing with and regulating wages nationally might secure equal benefits throughout the Federation area. The conference also decided to try to secure the abolition of existing anomalies in connection with the payment of the war wage, although Mr. Smillie pointed out that the passing of the resolution would involve an alteration of the agreement which had been made with the Coal Controller. It was also resolved to demand that all afternoon and night work should be paid for at the rate of shift and a-quarter for every shift worked. Resolutions were also passed in favour of an annual week&apos;s holiday with pay, a May Day holiday with central demonstrations, and an inquiry into the best means of eradicating the disease of nystagmus.Other resolutions were carried calling upon surface workers to observe loyally the Sankey Report, protesting against rising prices of clothes and foodstuffs, dealing with the Housing Bill, and approving payment of members serving on local public bodies. In private session the question of direct action was considered, and it was decided that at the meeting of the Triple Alliance on the 23rd July, the miners&apos; representatives will propose that the question of direct action be submitted to the members of the different sections with regard to : (1) Conscription; (2) Military Intervention in Russia ; (3) Release of Conscientious Objectors; and (4) Military Intervention in Trade Union Disputes.  A review of the proceedings appears in Part I of this Report.The Police Bill.The clauses of the Police Bill in which the constitution of a Police Federation is provided are of interest from the standpoint of Labour. The establishment of the Police Federation is stated to be for the purpose of enabling members of the police forces to bring to the notice of the police authorities and the Secretary of State all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, other than questions of discipline and promotion affecting indi-viduals. The members of each police force below the rank of superintendent shall form a Branch of the Federation, and in each police force three Branch Boards will be constituted, one for constables, one for sergeants, and one for inspectors. For each rank a Central Conference will be held annually, and delegates to this Conference, who must be members of the police forces which they represent, will be elected by the Branch Boards of corresponding rank. Each Conference will elect from among its members a Central Committee of six members, and these three Central Committees or any two of them may sit together as a Joint Committee for any special purpose, or regularly for all purposes of common interest. It is also provided that the Secretary of State may arrange for the holding of Police Councils for the consideration of general questions affecting the Police, at which the Joint Central Committee or a deputation from it may be invited to meet representatives of Police authorities, Chief Officers of Police, and Superintendents. The Police Federation and every branch of it are to be entirely independent of and unassociated with any body or person outside the police service.In view of the establishment of this Federation, the Bill prohibits any member of a police force from becoming or remaining a member of a trade union, with the exception that where a- man was a member of a trade union before becoming a constable he may be permitted to continue to be a member of that union during the time of his service in the police force. The Bill also renders punishable all attempts to create disaffection among the police, or to induce them to withdraw from duty.It is reported that the prohibitory clauses in the Bill arouse keen hostility among the
Labour members, and that there will be a severe battle over the Bill in Committee. resolutions are reported from Mansfield Labour Party, and from six N.U.R. branches, and one district council of the A.S.L.E. &amp; F. promising to support the Police Union in its hostility to this Bill by any necessary action.High Prices and Profits.It is stated that the Select Committee of the House of Commons on High Prices and Profits will have as its chairman Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland. The members are as follows:-Mr. T. W. Inskip, Lieut.-Colonel F. S. Jackson, Mr. Percy Hurd, Mr. R. A. D. Carter, Major P. L. Lloyd-Graeme, Mr. V. Hartshorn, Mr. C. H. Sitch, Mr. G. R. Thorne, Mr. J. S. Holmes, Major H. Barnes, Mr. T. Robinson, Sir H. Cowan, Mr. A. Short and Mr. T. M. Simm.The terms of reference are : &quot; To inquire how far the present high prices of articles of general consumption are due to excessive profits on the part of any persons concerned in their production, transport, or distribution, and to advise as to what action can usefully be taken in the matter.&quot; The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; complains that there are only three representatives of Labour on the proposed Select Committee.The Tin Plate Trade.Recent negotiations in the Welsh Tin Plate trade are of interest. The trade is highly organised, and is one in which the employees are to an unusual extent in the confidence of the employers. Before the setting up&apos; of the Joint Industrial Council, there was for many years a very efficient Conciliation Board in the industry, and by the establishment.of the Joint Industrial Council amicable negotiation has been still further encouraged. But recently the situation in the trade has altered, owing to the continued demands of the men, and the employers&apos; reiterated contention that their satisfaction would involve, in view of American competition, the practical annihilation of the industry ; and the rank and file of the workers are now attempting to repudiate their leaders, and secure their with-drawal from the Joint Industrial Council.On the 30th May a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held to consider the new demands which had been formulated by the men at the end of April. The claims affecting the various branches of the trade, and originally numbering 134, dealt mainly with wages advances, reduction of weekly hours and shifts, overtime rates, and increases in the number of men employed at each mill. At the meeting the employers argued that, in view of the growing menace of American competition such concessions would cause a serious handicap to the Welsh trade, alleging that the selling price of tin plates would thereby be raised by about 3s. 9d. per box.* The employers therefore proposed that before the claims were adopted a joint commission of employers and men should visit America in order to discover the causes of the greater output in that country. This suggestion was favourably received. The men moved a counter-proposal, however, that: (1) The millmen should be granted a 6-hour shift, and that(2) All the processmen should receive a temporary wage advance of 30 per cent, pending the report of the proposed Commission to America.It was finally decided to refer these last two proposals and that of the annual holiday to the Joint Standing Committee. The detailed claims of the annealers, millmen, tin-housemen and other sections were referred to nine separate committees. These com-mittees had been appointed by the 21st June and were due to report within 28 days.At a further joint meeting held on the 13th June, after various proposals and counter-proposals had been discussed, the following agreement was finally arrived at: (1) A general increase of 12^ per cent, for three months, from the 30th June to the 27th September.(2) The demand for an additional 12^ per cent, over and above the general increase of 12^ per cent, made on behalf of those not participating in the engineers&apos; award should be referred to arbitration.(3) A 6-hour shift for millmen was adopted in principle, subject to the reservation that no extra mills should be started in individual works until all mills now running in those works were on 6-hour shifts ; but no mills were to be stopped in order to change from 8 to 6-hour shifts.* With regard to the question of American competition it appears that American output has tieb!ed during the war and that the American export trade has increased five-fold, while the English has declined 50 per cent, since 1913.
The Commission to America-which was eventually approved by the men&apos;s repre-sentatives-will consist of about 10 employers, 6 trade union officials, and representatives of the various sections of tinplate Workers.At the Joint Industrial Council meetings the men&apos;s representatives seemed to appre-associate the seriousness of American competition, and were evidently willing to accept a corn-promise in order to avoid a stoppage in the industry. During the negotiations, however, the workmen themselves urged their officials to press for a full concession of the original demands, and workers in several districts have since repudiated the agreement. For example, at Neath a resolution was passed on the 21st June demanding that negotiations should be reopened on the basis of the original trade union claims, and threatening drastic action if the &quot; self-elected &quot; delegation to America were not withdrawn immediately. It is expected that opposition to the agreement will spread throughout the district. According to later information, at a delegate meeting of the steel sheet and fcinplate workers held on the 5th July, it was decided to withdraw from the Joint Industrial Council and seek union with the Triple Alliance. At present a ballot is taking place as to whether an unofficial strike shall be declared to compel the Joint Industrial Council to reopen negotiations on the men&apos;s original demand for a 50 per cent, advance.Textile Workers.The half-yearly meeting of the general union of Textile Workers was held on the 14th of July, and expressed itself in favour of drastic action on non-unionism, conscription, and wages. A ballot is to be taken on the question of a strike on non-unionism, and Mr. Ben Turner urged that a ballot vote on direct action in the Russia and Conscription issues should be taken by all the trade unions together, and not by unions separately at different times.Agriculture.The Royal Commission on Agriculture held its preliminary meeting on the 23rd July. The three additional members to complete the Commission are Mr. Alexander Batchelor and Mr. Wm. Edwards (agriculturists), and Mr. Thomas Henderson (the editor of &quot; The Scottish Farm Servant &quot;).  (See Report for the 9th July, 1919.)Peace Celebrations. *The counter-demonstrations which certain sections of the Labour extremists threatened to hold on the .19th July either did not take place at all, or were quite insignificant. The riots at Luton on Saturday night and at Coventry on Sunday night were not organised Labour demonstrations. It is reported that considerable dissatisfaction exists among dock workers on the ground either that they did not work on Saturday and therefore received no wages for that day, or that they did work and received only ordinary wages. For one or other of these reasons workers at the Victoria Docks, Hull, ceased work on the 21st July as a protest, and hundreds of dockers at Bristol and Avonmouth went on strike for a similar reason and declared they would not return to work until their demands were met. The Greenock Transport Workers&apos; Union has decided to observe each forthcoming Saturday as a holiday until they are paid for last Saturday.On Saturday the Burnley tramway men and gas-workers refused to work, because their demands for double pay for work on that day and an alternative holiday later were refused. The Burnley peace celebrations had been postponed until the 1st August, and the Corporation had decided to pay on that day an additional day&apos;s pay to men required to work.Russia Demonstrations.The demonstrations held on the 20th and 21st July to protest against intervention in Russia appear to have passed off very quietly. On the 20th inst., demonstrations were held in Trafalgar Square, also at Liverpool, Hastings, Barrow, Bath, Bristol, Pontypool and elsewhere. On the 21st inst. they took place at Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester, Brentwood, Portsmouth, Cardiff, Stratford, Whitehaven, East Grinstead, and at other places. Speakers at these meetings included Mr. Smillie, Mr. Frank Hodges, Mr. W. Brace, Mr. Neil Maclean, and Mr. George Lansbury. Many of the miners now on strike seem to have taken advantage of the fact to hold mass meetings on the Russian question. Meetings of this kind are reported from Mansfield, Swansea, Chesterfield, Dowlais and Merthyr.. There is no information, however, of any meetings of Yorkshire miners on this question.
It is reported that a spontaneous strike occurred on the 21st inst. at the London Docks and that a large number of men were affected by the movement, which followed immediately on the decision of the London District Committee of the Dockers&apos; Union to protest against the Governments intervention ir\ Russia. A large section of the London dockers have expressed their determination not to work on any ships loading ammunition for Russia. The Norwich Boot and Shoe Operatives&apos; Union&apos; struck work on the 21st inst. on the Russian issue. The Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society has taken a ballot which has resulted in a majority of two to one in favour of a withdrawal of labour as a protest against the Allied war on Russia.Income-Tax.Further resolutions advocating the raising of the Income-Tax abatement level to  250 have been passed by the Kidderminster and District Carpet Weavers&apos; and Textile Workers&apos; Association, and by Woolwich Arsenal workers. At the meeting of the latter it was announced that 1,500 Woolwich workers had returned their income-tax papers and were determined not to pay.Amalgamation, &amp;c. . ,It is reported that, the Conference of societies engaged in the building trade which opened in Manchester on the 16th June decided in favour of forming one Union. (See Report for the 16th July, 1919.)1 The draft constitution of the proposed amalgamation of the Boilermakers&apos; Society,-Ship Constructors and Shipwrights&apos; Association, and the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society, has been circulated to the members.The Furnishing Trades&apos; Association is taking a ballot on the question of dissolution prior to linking up with the Carpenters, Cabinet makers and Joiners. (See Report for the 18th June, 1919.)Members of the Hull Fishermen&apos;s Union have resolved to amalgamate with the Grimsby Fishermen&apos;s Union as the first step to the formation of a national union. All sections of trawler crews (excepting aliens) are eligible.Trade Union Friction.The Executive of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation has circularised all Affiliated Merseyside Branches requesting their support for the Amalgamated,Association of Tramway and Vehicle Workers in the dispute between that body and the Municipal Employees Association.Court of Arbitration. During the week ended the 17th July, 1919, the Court heard 16 cases, 9 in London, 5 in Dublin and 2 in Belfast. The principal case, heard in London was as follows: The Court were requested to consider whether they should advise the Minister of Labour to approve the agreement arrived at on the 19th May, 1919, by the South-Western Building Trades Conciliation Board relating to the wages of Building Trade Operatives in Plymouth.y&apos;7&apos;777::7:U&apos;&apos;7&apos; &apos;&apos;r&apos;1:^.;/&apos;i&apos;:^&apos;&quot;;&apos;v;VvV,/ &apos;. - -    &apos; &apos; -Trade Boards.Laundry Trade Board (Great Britain). The Laundry Trade Board (Great Britain) have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 16th July, 1919, to fix for female workers of 18 years of age and over a general minimum time rate of Id. an hour and an overtime rate of 8fd. an hour, with corresponding lesser rates for younger female workers. They also pro-pose to fix for female workers of the same ages guaranteed minimum time rates rising to 6dL an hour for female workers of 18 years of age and over, and a piece-work basis time rate of S^d. an hour. In the case of workers specially employed for emergency work, the general minimum time rate proposed is Id. an hour for female workers of 16 years and under 18 years of age, and l\d. an hour for female workers of 18 years of age and over, the piece-work basis time rate proposed for such workers being 9dL an hour.New Trade Boards. The Minister has established Trade Boards for the Brush and Broom trade (Great Britain) and the Corset trade.
(2) District Reports. ,London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The general decrease in unemployment continues, a decline of nearly 7,000 in the live register occurring during the week ending the 4th July. Small increases,, attributable to discharges &quot;from H.M. Forces, occurred in a number of centres.Resettlement. Traffic delays are still very acute, though in some cases an improvement has taken place. The main cause is shortage of wagons, large numbers being held up for repair. Difficulty in obtaining permits for the transit of goods by rail and shortage of carting facilities for goods at receiving stations are also the subject of complaint.Some difficulty is still experienced, especially by the smaller building contractors, in obtaining supplies of bricks. High prices, however, may possibly be the main cause of delay in building activities. It is reported, also, that timber is being held up by transport difficulties at docks and wharfs, that sand is difficult to obtain, owing to shortage of river craft, and that building Ironmongery and other supplies are delayed in transit. Serious delay in the manufacture of cement is stated to be caused by the low quality of coal allotted to the kilns.Local -authorities in a number of districts are proceeding with road making, drainage and other work approved by the Local Government Board or the Road Board.General.-Labour unrest is momentarily minimised by the peace celebrations, but still exists in every part of the London area.Indications point to vigorous action by trade unions, who are increasing membership in low-paid districts, and organising with a view to reaching an average level of  3 per week for a 47 or 48-hour week.South Midlands and Eastern.? :.Unemployment.-Unemployment continues to decrease though at a diminishing rate. The general state of employment is not considered to be serious.Resettlement. Lack of houses and insufficient transport facilities continue to retard resettlement. Building schemes at Northampton are stated to be delayed by differences between the Land Valuation Department and the owners of sites. There is a shortage of building labour in various districts, and at Leicester it is stated that importation will be necessary when operations on housing schemes commence. The cigar trade is reported to be capable of expansion if trained workers were forthcoming, but no training has been carried on during the war.At Luton the retention of men in Army Reserve Z is alleged to be the cause of con-siderable resentment among the workers in view of the possible use of the Reserve in case of grave industrial trouble.South-Western.Unemployment.-A further small decrease in unemployment is recorded. There are slight increases in the number of unemployed men at Cheltenham, Plymouth and Ports-mouth.Resettlement-A. dispute between the Borough Council of Barnstaple and the British. Construction Co. over the diversion of a public footpath is hindering an-undertaking which promises to find employment for several hundred men. In view of the housing position, and the shortage of timber the Employment Council have urged that the Government should dispose immediately of the great number of hutments at its command at a reasonable price. eweraZ.-Difficulties are arising in connection with the claims of ex-Service men to employment. Protests have been made as to the retention of women by tramway departments, and it is pointed out in connection with public improvement schemes that the preference is not always given which might be shown to men returned from the Forces.Inquiries have confirmed the current statements that work for which local firms had tendered was passing to foreign competitors owing to high prices. Definite information related to at least three cases where contracts went abroad which would have provided work for nearly three years.
West Midlands.Unemployment.-A considerable decrease in the figures of unemployed is reported, especially at Birmingham.Resettlement. The principal limiting factors are reported to be labour unrest, shortage of railway trucks, lack of housing accommodation, uncertainty of future prices, and the shortage and high price of coal. Three large firms are extending their works, and additional employees will be required.  There is a shortage of men skilled in metal press-work.General. The labour situation is for the most part satisfactory.  There are no indica-tions that.workers favour a cessation of work for the purpose.of political demonstrations. Meetings have been held in several establishments in favour of the raising of thelimit of exemption from income tr.x to  250, and combined action is being taken to support any workman who may be proceeded against for non-payment of tax when his income is below that limit.The wages awards for women workers provide considerable work for officers of the Ministry and present difficulties puzzling at times even to experts, owing to the variety of work done in various establishments, and often in the same establishments.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The decline in unemployment is slight, and confined almost entirely to Derby.Resettlement-Aii inquiry. into the iron and steel industry shows that great impedi-ment is caused by inadequate railway transport, by the retention of skilled men in the army, and by housing difficulties. Complaints are also made that while the embargo on exports was maintained, American firms entered into trading relationships with the northern parts of Europe, and that it will be difficult to recapture this trade.General. The industrial outlook is very dark. The effect of the Yorkshire coal strike will be speedily felt in the larger iron and steel works in the Sheffield area, and general stopping is feared. The increase in the price of coal seems likely to create urgent demands for higher wages, and add to the clamour against the profiteering which is said to exist in the clothing and food trades.The Leeds area is also deeply affected by the coal question, and the cities of Leeds and York have both been seriously inconvenienced, especially as regards the supplies of provisions and milk, by the stoppage of the train service on the North Eastern Railway.North-Western.Unemployment. A small increase in unemployment is reported, which is stated to be due mainly to the unsettled condition of the cotton trade.Resettlement. Lack of transport for manufactured goods is a cause of delay. Shortage of material in the building trade is reported from Macclesfield and Ashton-under-Lyne. The cotton strike was responsible for much unemployment, but the prospects on resumption are reported to be very good. Skilled workers are needed in the engineering trades at Preston.General, Considerable unrest prevails in this area, and employers appear to be deter-mined to have a fight, chiefly in order to ensure &apos;some degree of permanence in the matter of. wage-rates. They find it impossible to accept orders while strikes are threatening and demands for higher wages are being thrust upon them without reasonable notice.Northern.Unemployment.-A further reduction in the figures of unemployed is reported, the trades affected being engineering, general labouring, and domestic service.Resettlement. The engineers&apos; strike is having a serious effect upon the iron and steel trade on Tees-side. Shortage of railway wagons is delaying the work of road repairing. Labour is required in the quarries, but the demand is dependent upon housing accommo-dation and improved transport arrangements.Two shipyards are in course of construction at Hebburn. The North Eastern Railway Company propose to move their wagon works from Shildon to Darlington. It will be necessary to build 600 houses for the employees.(CT850) M
General. There has been some feeling of public resentment against the miners on account of the rise in the price of coal, and this has been increased by their refusal of the Governmenfs offer. The opinion is expressed that the miners are ready to use their organisation despotically. Much adverse criticism is being directed against the large increase in the cost of clothing and boots, and the purchasers consider that they are being unwarrantably exploited. Considerable progress towards the contemplated amalgamation of engineering trade societies has been made at special meetings of the North of England Brass Founders&apos;, Turners&apos;, Fitters&apos;, Finishers&apos; and Coppersmiths&apos; Association.Wales.   .Unemployment.-A. small increase in unemployment is reported, but the position is substantially the same as last week. The rise is attributed mainly to strikes in Merthyr and Ebbw Vale.Resettlement-Tlie prospect of an increase in the price of coal has caused great anxiety, and it is feared that the consequent increased cost of production will be disastrous in the steel and tinplate trades, where the greatest difficulty is being experienced in competing with America, and in the spelter industry where most firms have for months past been working only to about a third of their capacity. (See also the article on the tinplate trade in Part IV.)The Merthyr Corporation have commenced on constructional work, and it is anticipated that all available labour in this area will be absorbed. The erection of a number of houses has begun in the Port Talbot area, and, it is hoped, will provide employment for imported labour. Measures are being pushed on rapidly for opening out brickworks, and expediting the construction of houses, roads and sewers..General. No change is apparent in the general industrial situation. Restlessness is general, and a growing tendency is noticeable for the rank and file to act independently of their trade union officials.Great difficulty has been experienced in securing capable furnacemen in the spelter &quot;industry, and it is reported that employers intend to import Belgians for this work, but it is expected-that they will endeavour to allay the opposition to such importation of labour by resorting to it only when no other course remains open to them.Scotland. &apos;Unemployment.-The figures of unemployed are still decreasing.. The largest increase is at Inverness due probably to the rate of demobilisation and the fact that no new industries have been started. In Coatbridge unemployment among women is still serious. At -Paisley and Airdrie orders are scarce in the textile trades, but at Kirkcaldy there is an unsatisfied demand for labour in the local textile industries.. The position in the ship-building industry is unsatisfactory.Resettlement- The shortage of housing accommodation is still keenly felt. Transport, difficulties are hindering resettlement. Shortage of material is; reported in the textile trades at Paisley and in the shipyards where steel plates are urgently needed. Lack of; women skilled in fish-curing is reported from Wick. Shortage of skilled men is hindering development in the weaving, building and confectionery trades at Coatbridge,, the want of builders, bricklayers and joiners is preventing the employment of unskilled labour.. Road repairing is in progress at Leith and Dumfries. At Methii a new dock has been opened.6rmeraL-Unprecedented congestion exists on the railways, at the moment, owing to the fact that there is this year very little variation in the dates adopted by the chief centres for the customary ten days&apos; holiday. Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Paisley, Leith and Dundee are all on holiday until the 28th July.Part V.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Coal Miners.Yorkshire-The dispute about the fixing of piece-rates has now thrown 200,000 miners idle; most of the pump-men have been withdrawn, and flooding has set in at several of the mines. Naval stokers have been sent to carry on pumping operations. The Minister of Labour has notified the M.F.g.B. of this action, and asked what steps the Federation proposes to take to enforce its own ruling that the men should remain at work pending a settlement.
Railwaymen.As noted in a footnote to last week&apos;s report the strike on the North-Eastern Railway was settled on the 19th inst., the company agreeing that eyesight tests should be postponed till after the 21st August, by which time the establishment of a national test is anticipated. The men who were suspended are meanwhile to be re-instated. The service was gradually resumed bv the 22nd inst.Engineering, Shipbuilding and Metal Trades.Engineering draughtsmen are on strike at Stoke-on-Trent, one of the causes of the dispute being the low pay of ex-soldiers on the staff.With regard to the dispute at the Campbell Gas Engine Company&apos;s Works, Halifax, a conference has been held between employers, workmen, and a representative of the Ministry of Labour, and a proposal was submitted to the Strike Committee that the five ex-soldiers about whom the dispute exists should continue working, but that no further men should be. engaged for training until a national settlement has been arrived at.The engineers at. Messrs. Richardsons, Westgarth &amp; Co.&apos;s Works, Halifax, who were on strike about the employment of ex-soldiers, have returned to work. The terms of settlement are unknown.The steel-workers&apos; dispute in South Wales continues, and now involves the whole of the engineering sections at Tredegar, Ebbw Vale, Dowlais and Cyfarthfa, and the moulders at Cardiff. At a conference on the 17th inst. the employers put forward fresh proposals, with the threat of a lock-out if they were not accepted.  The men refused the terms.Building and Allied Trades.Bricklayers at Rochdale struck on the 20th inst. (in sympathy with those of Bury, who have been out for a month) to enforce their demand for an advance of id. per hour. The strike is unofficial, and is due to dissatisfaction with a demand which does not terminate till May, 1920. The master builders of Lancashire are stated to be taking a ballot of federated firms- on the question of a lock-out.The Leicestershire dispute was partially settled on the 19th inst. The employers offered the terms of settlement of the Loughborough dispute, less one penny per hour all round, and they were prepared to submit the penny in question to arbitration.

(C 1850) M2The effect of the strike is already being felt in engineering and other works. Sir Eric Geddes has gone to Yorkshire to investigate and deal with the situation. The Prime Minister, accom-panied by other ministers and advisers, conferred with the coal owners at 10, Downing Street, on the 23rd inst., and with the Executive of the M.F.G.B. on the 24th inst.Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. About 45,000 men have struck as a protest against the Qs. a ton increase on the price of coal, combined with political motives. The strike is apparently not recognised by the local miners&apos; officials.Lancashire and Cheshire. The increased price of coal and disputes about piece-rates have caused strikes at Burnley and Westhoughton, and threats of strikes elsewhere. In all about 7,500 are idle.  The local Miners&apos; Federation has advised the men to return to work.Kent. The strike about hours continues, some 1,500 being idle, but negotiations are proceeding.Northumberland and Durham. Most of the men on strike have now returned to work, but a fresh dispute has broken out in South-West Durham.South Wales. In Monmouthshire 11,000 were idle as a result of the dispute about surfacemen&apos;s hours, and a similar number in Glamorganshire were on strike over local disputes. Some of these men have returned to work on the recommendation of the S.W.M.F. The men who stopped work in the Neath district owing to the non-provision of suitable trains have returned to work, suitable arrangements having now been made.Scotland. In Dumbartonshire, Fifeshire, See, some 4,000 men are idle over the adjustment of hours. The ballot in Haddington and Midlothian on the question of joint action in support &apos; of the men at Polton colliery has gone strongly in favour of a strike.
