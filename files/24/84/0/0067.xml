There is really quite as strong a case for the payment of the members of the L.C.C. as there is for the payment of k.P&apos;s, and it will not be unknown to you that Paris i,B already, paying its municipal councillors.tt        :.2.    At present, members of local authorities do not as auoh receive payment for their services.In the case of some of the bodies set up for far purposes whose members are appointed by local authorities, such as the Military Service Tribunals and Food Control Committees, a payment is allowed for* lose of remunerative&apos; time.   Members of Ibod Control Committees-can be paid at the rate of l/* an hour.   Members of Insurance Committees may olso be paid for loss of remunerative time.The position in these cases differs from that ofmembers of local authorities- in that the payment ia made for% -work which is quite outside&apos; the ordinary duties of localauthorities,and also that the coat, falls largely, if not * wholly, on Imperial Funds&apos;,3*    My feeling is, that the Government should resia^b
any proposal to pay a salary to members of local authorities,There is no reason for treating the London County Councillors exceptionally and to make the concession in their case would mean that a similar concession must be made to other local authorities with the result that salaries would have to be paid to/several tens of thousands of persons.It is quite possible to distinguish the case of members of the House of Commons,   Members of Parliament have to maintain a hone in London and practically to live there the greater part of the year.   The  400 they receive is in effect only a subsistence allowance towards the cost of their London home. To fulfil membership of local authorities one is not required to live away from home.   Ho general desire has been exhibited for the payment of members, of local.authorities, the demand for payment being practically confined to Labour circles.   It is the practice of the Labour Organisations.to pay their representatives on the local bodies,but there is reason to ,believe that they are- anxious to shift this burden on to .other shoulders.4.    The view which has been taken by the Central Department, and which is. supported by decisions of the Courts, is, that members of local authorities are not entitled to any payment for carrying out the ordinary duties of their offioe.The County Councils&apos; Association have urged that County Councillors should be repaid their travelling expenses in attending meetings within their County, end I believe they are proposing to introduce a Bill to legalise such payments. County Councils have amuch stronger case than other local authorities on account of: the.great size of many of the counties and the heavy expenses involved in many cases in journeys to the county town where the meetings of the council are held,   This Bill, if introduced, would afford an- opportunity for gauging public opinion on this question, but I have little doubt that it would soon be followed by a general demand for
* .the allowance of travelling expenses and of a reasonable sum for subsistence during absenoe from homev   At present I doubt whether suoh a demand could effectively &quot;be resisted^5.    Irom &quot;the payment of travelling expenses and subsistence allowances,both of which are really out of pocket charges, it is a long step to any payment for time,If eventually  t became neoessary to,concede payment for loss of remunerative time I think the payment should be at so much per hour, for time occupied oil the work of the authority as in the case of Pood Control Committees.8.    If my colleagues agree I would propose to refuse the request for payment of salaries but to say that the whole question of travelling expenses and allowances to members  -while engaged on the duties of their office will receive the immediate consideration of the Consultative Council on Local Government questions set up under the Ministry of Health Act. Some formal investigation of the question seems necessary before any decision is arrived at and it is possible that the payment.of travelling expenses.and subsistence all3wanoes* would go a long way towards meeting any immediate claims.7, As important questions of principle are involved I should be glad to have.the views of my. colleagues before I take any action in the matter,C.
