CABINET mOMUlMemorandum &quot;by tho Secretary of State- f or theColonies.1 think my colleagues may wish to see the attached copy of a letter which I have received from General&quot; Smuts,M22.7.19,
Savoy Hotel, London..17th July,1919Dear Lord Milner,May I say a word on the great importance of maintaining a full service of inter-imperial information? I believo this work is now being done by Reuter and that it costs less than  20,000 per annum.    Nothing could be more important in keeping the scattered members of the Empire together than a full and efficient information service, and the  20,000 is probably doing more good than millions of pounds spent in other directions.    I therefore venture to hope th$t in a matter of vital imperial policy like this the narrower Treasury paijrt-of view will not be made to prevail.Yours sincerely,(Sd)   J.-.6. SMUTS.
