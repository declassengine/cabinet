General Nadir Khan had originally invited 12 Maliks to see him at Matun. Mahsud Maliks replied that they could never decide which Maliks should represent them, and asked for number to be increased to 120. Jirga was then held and paper from Nadir Khan read asking Mahsuds to help if the Amir called on them. Somewhat heated discussion took place before the Afghan Sirdar, who calls himself Colonel. One party of Mahsuds, chiefly young men, wanted settlement with British in order to commence trading again. Other side, consisting of Maliks and Mullah Fazl Din, were pro-Afghan. Tomani party refused to let any Maliks go to Matun to represent them, saying that whole tribe must be invited or no one. Written reply was sent eventually to Nadir Khan that if Amir supplied guns, rifles, and money Mahsuds would rise and drive British across Indus, but unless these were provided they would not move. All Maliks present signed this condition. Mahsuds do not consider Nadir Khan intends giving them rifles.&quot;
