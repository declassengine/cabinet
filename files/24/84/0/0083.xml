circular has accordingly &quot;boon issued to local authorities  , suggesting that, where thoy consider such a course desirable, thoy should, af tor obtaining the opinion of the Housing Commissioner that the site is generally suitable, request the District Valuer to negotiate with the owner without &quot;first reporting to them his opinion of the value of the site.3,    Supply of aateriala,   A Production Branch of the Housing [Department has been constituted for dealing with questions of material^ labour and transport;&apos;  and the Organisation Which is being set up in each Region under:the Housing Commissioner for the same purpose is being completed.4.    Housing Advisory Council.-  Tho Advisory Council whioh Dr, Addison decided to appoint for the purpose of giving advice and assistance in connection with the Government Housing scheme, has been constituted.   It is proposed to make constant use of this Council both in the consideration of many large questions which are arising, and for the, purpose of forming sub-oommittees from its members with the addition of members from-,outside, to&apos; consider detailed and technical questions.  Pour such sub* committees have boon sitting for some time past, dealing with (l) the standardisation of methods and materials, and the use of new methods and materials;   (2) the revision of forms of contract;   (3) the revision of forms of specification and schedules;: (4) the financial Safeguards required in connection with housing schemes.

Dr, Addison attended the meeting held on the 25th June, and made a statement to members on the general position, indicating a number of ways in which tho members of the group could assist, particularly by interviewing local authorities.    The members were informed that a meeting of the Building Trade Industrial Council was being-summoned to discuss the supply of labour and its output, &apos;.&apos; and that it was hoped to arrange for an agreement in regard to production, abbreviated apprenticeship, and dilution for the purposes of the National Housing Scheme.During the month Dr. Addison undertook a tour of the North of England, addressing meetings with regard to Housing at Nottingham, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle, while meetings at Southampton and Cambridge have been addressed by Major Aster and at Chatham and Northampton by Sir Kingsley Wood on the same sUbject, ..6.    Procedure in regard to Housing Schemes,   a Circular has been issued to local authorities suggesting that, in order to obviate delay in proceeding with schemes undertaken by them, the authority should, if they have not already dons so, appoint , a Housing Committee, and delegate to that Committee as much as possible of tho work in connection with their Housing schemes. The attention of the local authorities is drawn to the fact that when the Housing Bill becomes law it will be possible to delegate to the Committee all the powers of the local authority except those of borrowing money and making a rate.difficulty has been experienced, when obtaining
tenders for the construction of a large nifebor of housesiin taking flail advantage of the services of small local contractors. Instructions have &quot;been issued to Commissioners that they should endsavour to obtain tho immediate submission of many smaller schemes tyhich could bo put into operation at once.    The , Commiesliners have also been instructed thjvfc, it cases w&amp;fcre there is an existing frontage and a sewer available, tho local authority should be5 pressed to prepare, a lay-out plan for the whole estate in outline only, anc! to prepare house plans1 for the houeee on the existing frontage and obtain tenders at on6e.   In order to expedite the procedure further, the Commissioners have been authorise^ to approve, without submission %h the Board, the lay-out and house plans submitted by local authorities in oases in which the lay-out is for not tfcrs than 100 houses and tho sites have been approved by the Board.7, -Rousing Schemes.

The total area comprised in these sites was about 32,000 acres whioh would provide roughly for some 320,000 houses.   . The number of sites approved was 802, covering about 12,770 acres.The total number of applications, up to 28th June, for approval of lay-outs was 384, of which the Board had approved 176,Up to June 28th House plans for 18,019 houses in all had bean submitted and of these the Board had given approval for 8,300 houses.II,   HEALTH.i*    Ministry of Health Act.

Venereal Diseases..   Three more Main Treatment Oentres for Venereal Diseases wore opened during the month, making a total of 148,   The number of auxiliary centres is now 73, and.H bostels ahd 4 other institutions a,re in use for the treatment o  special classes of women and g&apos;girls&apos; suffering from these disease^ The iiinistry have under consideration the question of the provision of further facilities in rural and other areas with a small density of population, and proposals have been approved under which whole-time madical officers of the local authority will carry out the treatment of these diseases in conjunction with their othei medical work.0*    Tuberculoses.,   The total number of beds for the treat-ment of tubercuToiTs In institutions approved b  the Board was 14,014, an increase of 173 during the month.   The corresponding number in the first week of August, 1914, was 8,888, the number of beds in institutions provided by local authorities having increased since that date from 4.016 to 7,379 and by tho authorities of voluntary institutions from 4,872 to 6.635.Some 600 additional beds will be available vory shortly in institutions which have been recently released by the military authorities, or the completion of which has been delayed by war conditions.The difficulties which had arisen in Liverpool in finding beds for ex-service men suffering from tuberculosis who need residential treatment, are being satisfactorily met.   The Fazakerley Sanatorium has been brought into partial use and tho number of beds in occupation is being increased at short interval, In addition, the  azakerley Isolation Hospital has been evacuatea by the military authorities and 50 beds in this Hospital are being used for the treatment of tuberculosis,   The question of accommodation in the ITorth Eastern Counties is oausing some -anxiety.9,    Maternity and Child Welfare,    The ilaternity and Child Welfare1 grant &quot;is&quot;now available in respect of expenditure on hospital accommodation for measles and whooping cough, where additional accommodation is secured by means of such expenditure.During the past month the Board have approved proposals by 43 local authorities for extending their schemes of maternity and child welfare,    In four of these cases the extensions include the acquisition of premises for hospitals, creohes and maternity and child welfare centres, and in one oase a loan to the amount of  1,106 was sanctioned.

IIISCBLLAKBOUS^1.    Public Works.   During the month of June, 228 applications ^ere&apos;received from Local Authorities for sanction tjb loans for public works.   This is an increase of 10 over the number received in Kay and of 111 and 89 over the numbers received in Staroh and April respectively.   Included in these applications is one from the Manchester Town Council for sanction to borrow  1,042,000 for the provision of a generating station in oonnection with their electrioal undertaking.The total amount of tho loans sanctioned during the month was  554,153, a decrease of  270,696 as compared with the amount sanctioned in Hay which is probably due to the Whitsuntide holiday season.   The decrease is most marked in the amount sanctioned for electricity purposes, which has dropped from  355,563 to 43.03,675,     There was also a decrease in the amounts sanctioned for gas and for sewerage and sewage disposal purposes.   On the other hand the loans sanctioned for street improvement purposes increased from  91,360 to  163,445,Applications for sanotion to loans were refused in two eases the total amount involved being  13,213.During the month loans amounting to  69,371 have been sanctioned for the purchase by County Councils of estates having a total area of about 1,800 acres for the land settlement of ex-serVioe men.    As compared with last month this shows an increase of  14,781 in the amount sanctioned and 300 aores in the area to be acquired.The Boa.xd!s Engineering Inspectors have continued to visit various Districts Jn order to stimulate the Local Authorities to proceed with public works, as explained in the Reports for April and Hay,   The following summary gives particulars of tho estimated cost of works in progress or which are in contemplation by the 908 Local Authorities with whom the Inspectors have conferred between the date of the armistice and June 30th,&apos;  *(a) Works now in progress (Excluding Housing)    4,951,000* this includes the results, so far as received, of the monthly Return asked for from the larger looal authorities on the 29th Hay, the total additional figures from this source being  2,093,000,,(b) Necessary preliminaries completed andCouncils disposed to proceed (including 1,230,400 for Housing)..............,..,,16,674,000(c) Necessary preliminaries completed but \Councils not disposed to proceed.(Nil, for.

A memorandum was prepared on the Bill for the information of Lord  eel who will deal with the Bill on behalf of the Government,   It is not intended to oppose th9 2nd Reading.3.      celebrations brat1on of Pe ace.   In view of the general desire to celebrate the declaration of P&amp;ace, the Board notified Poor Law Authorities on the 25th June of the issue of an Order enabling them to make, suitable te&amp;porary modifications in the Regulations in force With regard to discipline and diet.   The Board also notified other local authorities on the same day of the issue of&apos;ah Order sanctioning Reasonable expenses in connection with any public local celebration of Peace in so far as those expenses are charged in accounts subject to audit&quot; by a District Auditor.    The view was expressed that the powers conferred by the Order should be used where necessary to supple-ment funds otherwise contributed rather than to supersede such funds.4.    War Memorials.   A memorandum has been issued indicating that where it is proposed to erect a memorial of a kind which a local authority is not already generally authorised by law to provide, the Board would be willing, where the accounts of the authority are subject to government audit, to sanction under the Local Authorities (Expenses) Act, 1887, reasonable expenditure out of the local rates towards a Memorial of a suitable character, It has been pointed out that this sanction would not, however, legalise the expenditure, and the Board could not therefore sanction the raising of loans in these cases.   Authorities are urged to ensure a substantial proportion, of the total amount from voluntary subscriptions before resort is had to the rates, and to provide for an endowment where-expenses of maintenance are involved which cannot lawfully be defrayed out of the rates,5.    ^S^f^s. of representatives, of Local Education Authorities&quot; visiting&quot; Industrial&quot;gohbols.   The Home Office expressed the opinion that expenses of representatives of Local Education Authorities visiting Industrial Schools to which children are sont from the district might properly be regarded as expenses connected with the duty of the authority, unless there were legal or other objections.    The Board pointed out the absence of statutory provision and stated that if the Secretary of State desired that the schools should be so visited the matter should be dealt with.by specific legislation,   0n this understanding the Board offered to sanction reasonable expenses in the particular case for the current year under the Local Authorities (Expenses) Act, 1887,.
u        6,    Gratuities.  Hitherto the payment of gratuities from the rates &quot;to the&apos;dependants of officers of Local Authorities who lost their lives in the war has not been considered to be justified having regard to the provision made by the State.    The practice of declining to sanction the payment of these gratuities has however been altered and sanction is now given in deserving cases.7.    Rejief. of JtorJDlstress..    The grants made from the National Relief Fund&quot;upon the recommendation of the Government Committee during the month, were as follows *To Local Representative Committees for theprovision of direct assistance................       3,369To Local Representative Committees for the relief of Air Raid distress........................... 30To the Central Charities Committee for the relief of repatriated civilians...................... 1,000 or the relief of distress among the professionalclasses......................................t 2,150Total  6,569Grants amounting to  6,070 were made to three Canadian Fund Committees to enable them to deal with applications from lodging house keepers for assistance by the payment of rent or mortgage interests up to the end of last March quarter.    These three Committees are those referred to in last Months report as still outstanding.As a result of the letter received from the Sub-Committee of the Bast Coast Conference drawing attention to those cases of lodging house keepers who have been obliged to part with their furniture, which is absolutely necessary if they are to resume their letting this year, the Committee of the National Relief Fund, on the recommendation of the Government Committee, have now allocated a sum of  10,000 for the purpose of rendering assistance where required to persons of this,class in replacing furniture and carrying out what is necessary in the way of repairs &amp;c. to, premises.   Grants amounting to  5,000 (or 50$ of the total sum allotted) have now actually been made on an allocation provisional:; made by the Bast Coast Conference to 21 Canadian Fund Committees.It was recently decided by the Exeoutive Committee of the National Relief Fund, that assistance from the Fund should tease after the 31st July, and the Government Committee accordingly addressed a circular letter on the 27th June to all Local Representative Committees who were at the time administering grants from the fund, instructing them to entertain no fresh applications for assistance after the end of June, except in the case of a repatriated civilian prisoner of war or refugee in distress, and to inform aU persons to,whom aesistance was being granted that such assistance would not &quot;be available after the 31st July,If is realised, however,, by the Government Committee end by the Exeoutive Committee that in a limited number of oases distress directly caused by. the war will continue, and arrangements are in contemplation for taking over such oases from the Looal Representative Committees who will then be relieved of all. responsibility in tho matter.. Forms were enclosed with the circular letter for the local Committees to make reports upon oases of this kind with a view either to continuing assistance to them or to making in suitable oases a small lump sum grant for the purpose of rehabilitation,.
8.    Assistanoe to Alienj.   The Treasury have-now written giving authority for an intimation to Boards of Guardians that they can cbunt upon repayment, as authorised under existing arrangements, of expenditure incurred in respect of assistance to aliens and their dependants, up to the end of the quarter which includes the date of termination of the war.The Treasury however add that they cannot o on template the indefinite continuance of grants from the Exchequer for this purpose, and request that the whole position ma^ he reviewed by this Department in concert with the Home Office and the foreign Office at the earliest possible date.; te^ treasury have also authorised new arrangements for the payment of Exchequer grants in respect of the internment camps ih the isle of Man * as reobmmended by the Civilian Internment Camps Committee and the Home Office.9.    Military occupation of Poor Lew Premises.    The military authorities &quot;continue&quot;&quot;to return to poor law authorities poor law premises which have been occupied as military hospitals.   Of an approximate total number of 75,000 poor law beds so occupied, approximately 32,414 have been vacated or were in course of vacation by the military by the end of June, 1919,A circular letter was issued on the 30th June by the Board, after correspondence with the War Office to Boards of Guardians whose premises have been in whole or part occupied by the military authorities, indicating the procedure to be adopted ae regards the repair of dilapidations and damages at the expense of the Army Council, payment to the Military authorities for permanent improvements effected to poor law premises, and the acquisition by poor law authorities of surplus stores and equipmen on their premises which they may wish to purchase from the Surplus Government Property Disposals Board at the termination of the military occupation,10*.  Poor Law Schools.,. A circular letter to poor law authorities was Issued by the Local Government Board on.the 20th June indicating the modifications subject&apos;to which the General Order of. the 20th January, 1897, relative to the instruction of ohildren who receive their education in schools, provided by poor law authorities, should now be read in view of later legislation and especially the Education Act of 1918.These modifications are as follows:-(a) the upward limit of 14 years of school attendancewill no longer fce in all oases effective;(b) , partial exemption from the obligation to attend .school is no longer permissible;(c) poor law authorities are now empowered to adopt thesame term and holiday periods as those fixed by the local education authority for the area in which the -poor law school is situated,11,   Pauperism,   There was a further decrease in the number of persons receiving outdoor relief during the month of May,   The figures on the 3lst May being 455*000 as compared with 457,000 on the .31st April.    The total i3 5,600 less than the corresponding, total at the end of Hay, .1918,
