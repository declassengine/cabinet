May it be known to My illustrious friend His Excellency the Viceroy of the mighty Government of India in the British Empire that Your Excellency^ friendly letter of 9th Shawalpass 1337 Hijra corresponding to 8th July 1919 has reached me, and I have been made acquainted with its contents which are full of friendship (corrupt group) refer to past hostilities and in which it is stated there is nothing to be gained by further lengthy correspondence, and you should therefore think it advisable that all past misunder-standing should be removed by meeting of Peace delegates. You also wish for their presence at the place appointed on 23rd Shawalpass 1337 Hijra corresponding to 22nd July 1919. You also express your unwillingness to the attendance of military escort in India by assuring us of safety of our delegates, and you have also informed me of the delegates which Your Excellency has been pleased to approve the appointment of for this settlement. The friendly sentiments expressed by Your Excellency gave us great pleasure, but to reply to each point separately in detail appears unnecessary and would simply lengthen letter unduly. We will therefore be brief.&quot; &apos; With reference to arrival of peace delegation on the 23rd Shawal at the appointed place, as proposed by Your Excellency, we desire to say that deputation under our noble and dear brother Ali Ahmad Khan, Minister of Home Affairs, will arrive at selected place on the 25th of the month above mentioned, and the trust that Your Excellency (corrupt group) accordingly expect their arrival on that date. As Your Excellency expresses Certain apprehensions in connection with military escort, which we proposed to send with our deputation, we accept your views. Our military escort will only escort deputation as far as we consider it advisable for their safety.&quot; &apos; We have made ourselves acquainted with rank and names of those delegates now appointed by Your Excellency, and we agree to them, Your Excellency is the person who knows best who should be appointed.&quot; &apos; On our part we have appointed Abdul Rahman Khan, our newly appointed envoy to India, as an additional member of our peace deputation.&quot; &apos; We trust now that, God willing, peace with honour to both the friendly Powers will be established in near future, and the honourable object of both parties will be attained.&apos; &quot;
