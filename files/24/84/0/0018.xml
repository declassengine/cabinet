This Document Is the Property ofiis BritanriiG Mafesty&apos;s Government1020 S. 800 S., andFrom Viceroy, llth July 1919. (Received 16th, 10.45 a.m.)Afghan Mission. Peace Conference. &apos; Our telegram of 12th ultimo, Director of Military Intelligence^ telegram No. 79195, 24th June. Wireless (? installation) from Tashkend to Foreign Commissary, Moscow, dated 27th June, intercepted Quetta 30th June and Jutogh 8th July, runs as follows : &quot; (R.) The Afghan Mission has returned to Aralskoe 17th July, and in three days will be in Tashkend. In choosing the route for Mission we were guided by following considerations : (I) In Tashkend we learned by wireless telegraphy that 6,000 Red troops occasionally pass Fort Alexandrovsk, so that we had no suspicion that latter place was not in Soviet hands. (2) Route via Aral sea and beyond that by pack-road through the Transcaspian district is absolutely safe. It is only difficult in .as far as movement is concerned. (3) Hardly any of the members of Mission had ever seen an aeroplane before. (Remainder is -very mutilated. Meaning appears to be as follows): The motion gives impression of insecurity and members of Mission did not regard aeroplane with confidence. It appeared to us, therefore, that a journey by aeroplane would hardly be welcome to them. Besides, Mission asked for a written guarantee of safety of this mode of travelling. If you feel in a position to give such a guarantee in your name flight will be organised.   Kindly reply urgently.&quot;
