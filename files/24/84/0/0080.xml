7 P. / t C  the ProDsrtv oftr. Q JvernmeiTLMEMORANDUM Bff MINISTER OF LABOUR FOR VfAR CABINET, Use of Military huts for housing civilian workers.1,        I have now had an opportunity of conferring with the other Ministers concerned on the subject of Decision &quot;Dw War Cabinet 569, Minute 1, which is as follows:- .&quot;That the Minister of Labour, in consultation with the War Office, the Minister of Munitions, The Local Government Board, and the Board of Agriculture, should ascertain to what extent huts could be provided in agricultural districts for the housing of discharged ^soldiers whom it was proposed to employ on the land,&quot;It will be seen that the Minute refers only to hutments being used for the housing of discharged soldiers for employment on the land; but at the first conference which I held with the Minister of Munitions and representatives of the War Office, Local Government Board, and Board of Agriculture, it became plain that the greatest need for huts was in urban areas.   Subsequent conferences made it clear that the Board of Agriculture did not feel that any useful purpose would be served by pursuing the matter further from their point of view. Accordingly I have considered it with the War Office, Local Government Board and the Ministry of Munitions from the point of the general industrial situation.2.      I attach to this note a classified list of the districts wherethe need for accommodation is most urgent.   Column A gives a list ofthe localities where conditions are worst,&apos; Column B, indicates inwhich of the same localities.conditions would, be^alleviated,by provision of nuts; Column 0 indicates in which of tne localitiesenumerated in B the provision of huts would not only relieve congestion,but make additional employment possible.   It is accordingly the localities in Column C to which I have directed my immediate attention.3.      As regards the available supply of huts, the information obtained from the War Office leads me to believe that the huts which they have released, or will shortly he releasing, should suffice to meet the most pressing needs of the next two or three months.   Unfortunately the placed where huts are available are not the places wheye they will be required.   Moreover I cannot be sure that workpeople will be generally prepared to live in huts which are adapted only for single men: it would probably be necessary to concert the huts so as to accommodate not only the workpeople themselves but their families too. There is this further difficulty about conversion, that the type of labour required for the purpose is the same as that required for building houses; and there are indications that we are approaching a period when there will be an acute shortage of building labour.   In any case the process of demolition, removal, etc, will occupy some considerable time - probably riot less than two or three months.4,      As to finance, the cost of demolition, removal, re-erection, and (where necessary) conversion, will clearly be a serious factor, in the situation.   I understand from the Ministry of Munitions that the cost of the demolition, re-erection and conversion would be from  240 to  300, over and above the price of the huts, which are being sold by the Disposal Board to private purchasers at about  100 apiece. To this must be added the oost of transport, which would of course vary with the distance that the huts have to be transported.
5.       Despite the many difficulties inherent in the scheme, the industrial situation is so serious that I am reluctant to abandon the idea of using the huts to relieve the dearth of housing accommodation, which is one of the most formidable obstacles to the re-absorption of&apos;labour.   I believe, too, that a serious effort in this direction would have an excellent political effect by proving that the Government are fully alive to the exigencies of the situation, and determined to do all in their power to relieve the situation -even if it be only by means of emergency arrangements in a few places where congestion is most acute.6,       The Local Government Board recently announced that they would be prepared to regard the provision of accommodation by means of converted huts as part of a local scheme, which will rank for State financial assistance.   It vould be too sanguine to expect that local authorities will freely invest, at a cost of  100 apiece, in huts which can at the best have but a short life.   I anticipate, therefore, that the scheme may necessitate a substantial grant from the Exchequer. If however as I hope, the scheme would lead to the re-absorption of \ some 6,000 to 7,000 workpeople, it is worth carrying through especially having regard to the prospect of trouble in the winter, owing to lack of employment,7,        I have not as yet prepared any detailed estimates of cost. This would take some time, and would be a waste of labour unless the Cabinet are willing to agree in principle to a State subsidy to the Local Authorities for the purpose in question, over and above the grants payable under the Government Housing Scheme.   For the moment therefore I only ask the authority of the Cabinet(a) to agree in principle to a special grant from the Exchequer to be made by the Ministry of Health or Scottish Office as the case may be to assist Local Authorities to purchase, re-erect, and if necessary convert, Army huts for the use of workpeople in places where the shortage of housing&apos; accommodation is acute, and where the huts would not only relieve this shortage but lead to the employment of additional labour: and(b) to authorise the Ministry of Health, or the Scottish Office as the case may be, in consultation with the Ministry of Labour to enter into negotiations for this purpose with the Local Authorities in the localities .indioated at (a)It would of course be understood that the Departments concerned, would not commit themselves to any expenditure of State money without the preliminary consent of the Treasury and the War Cabinet,R.S. HORWE.23rd July 1919.
