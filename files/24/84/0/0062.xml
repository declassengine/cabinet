,/ From Viceroy, 21st July 1919.(Received 3 p.m.)1066 S. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 16th July. We much appreciate guidance and latitude given, and our delegates will work on lines indicated if Afghan delegates come in. We have, however,&apos; had no reply from Amir, and it is possible Afghan delegates may not arrive at hour appointed. Meanwhile whole tribal situation has deteriorated, as reported in, our recent telegrams, Army and Foreign and Political Departments. There has been incessant intriguing by Afghans with our tribes, particularly Afridis, and our armistice terms have thus been grossly flouted, and we have ample justification for immediate resumption of hostilities, for which preparations have been made. We feel, however, that should Afghan delegates arrive in time and proceed to Rawal Pindi, this in itself may act as a cold douche on tribes who will suspect Amir has used them as a cat&apos;s paw and is now making peace for himself Avithout regard to them. If, thereafter, Afghan intrigues with our tribes should continue, we presume we have discretion to break off negotiations or to take such other action as may seem best. We propose, therefore, to wait until 22nd July. If no satisfactory letter from the Amir has been received by then, and Afghan delegates fail to appear, we shall resume hostilities without notice. Actual measures proposed have been reported by Army Department. Long period of inaction has caused such deterioration in tribal situation that, unless prompt measures are taken either in form of overt peace negotiations at Rawal Pindi or of active military measures, there may be serious spread of the trouble both north and south.
