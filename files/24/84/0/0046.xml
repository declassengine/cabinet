This report apparently was fore-stalled by the legislation, the effect of which is about to be described, with the result that the members of the Socialisation Commission tendered their resignations. The majority of seven, as opposed to a minority of two, advocated a transfer of the whole industry, including State and privately owned concerns, to a corporate body called the &quot; Coal Commonwealth,&quot; controlled by a Council of 100 members, upon which there should be equal representation of wage workers, consumers, management, and National Govern-ment. This Council was to elect the Board of Directors not necessarily from its own members, and for this purpose it was to compete in the open market with other industries for the best managerial ability, offering adequate salaries. The industry would thus be autonomous, with balances transferred to the National Government, sufficient sums having been written off from the reserve fund. The chief checks upon this autonomy were State control of prices, and of mortgaging the Commonwealth property. Democratic conditions were to obtain, the workers co-operating with the management in the works. State owner-ship was rejected on the ground that initiative must be preserved; monopolistic private enterprise was rejected because of the &quot; psychological&quot;. condition of the labour world. Solution was found in the conception of vocational autonomy subject to control of prices policy..The Minister for Economics defended the conservative policy of the Government to a Socialist Congress on the ground that complete socialisation at a time .of inflated(o 1842) &apos; 255   7/19  h asA
values would only saddle the State with an enormous debt; that socialisation would be credited with causing the rise in prices which was bound to continue; that the wages bill would also rise, since men only think of what they can get from the State, not of the duty they owe to it. Even royalties are at present untouched, since special legislation will be necessary in view of rights held by constituent States. The relation of employer and employed, private capital, and profits, still subsist, but production is organised by districts upon the following principles : (i) Elimination of Competition. The concerns in each district are to be compulsorily federated into a district syndicate, which is to control production, consumption at the mine, and the sale of coal. Thus competition, which remained to a certain extent even under the monopolistic conditions which had grown up before the war, is definitely excluded. The syndicates sell in their own name on account of their members, but in country districts and in other cases where it is consistent with the public interest, they may delegate power to their members to sell on their own account. They will determine the pro-portion of sales, and the consumption by the members themselves.(v) Joint Management. This principle is introduced throughout the industry. Each district syndicate has a supervising council upon which the workers appoint two or three members, and a board of management upon which they appoint one member. There does not appear to be any information as to what proportion this represents of the total membership of these hodies.(hi) Administrative Autonomy. Subject to the control about to be described, it is hoped by those responsible for the scheme that the autonomous nature of the district bodies will serve to stimulate energy and responsibility, so that output will be increased, and the mines be effectively exploited. The Government have the right to appoint a deputy to the district council, who is empowered to appeal against decisions which may be contrary to public interest.Apparently a decree of the 18th January is still in force, regulating workers&apos; com-mittees for the mine or pit.. These committees are to protect the health and safety of the workers, and to co-operate with the management in enforcing collective agreements, and in settling conditions and wages in default of such agreements. The decree was framed to meet the need of the workers for something more than trade union organisation, and it was left to the workers to harmonise the constitution of these bodies with trade union practice. The general resemblance to the development. of works committees, and the more constructive side of the shop stewards movement in this country during the war is of interest.......................Supervisory Control of Production and Distribution. (i) This is chiefly exercised by the Imperial Coal Council, which is assisted by three expert committees, one for the science of coal mining, one for the utilisation of fuel, and the third to deal with the socio-political aspect of the industry. The Council lays down guiding general principles, especially with a view to eliminating non-economic competition in distribution, and to protecting the consumer. The constitution of the Council is framed to secure a wide social standpoint. It is composed of 50 members, representative of miners, mine-owners, consumers, coal merchants, and scientists. The details for its constitution are modelled upon the statutory lines laid down for the Council of Experts, which were as follows : 15 representatives of workers, 13 representatives of employers,nominated by Government on proposal of respective vocational associations : of workers and employers belonging to the recent Joint Industrial League ofEmployers and Employees Federations. 2 representatives of employers nominated by the Prussian Minister of Commerce. .20 representatives of specified groups nominated by Government upon the following basis: &apos;(i) Commercial employers     ..      ..      ..    -..      ..    3Commercial employees     ........      ..    1(ii) Technically trained employees........2(iii) Coal-consuming industries Employers......      ..      ..      ..    2Workers        ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..    2(iv) Small scale industries      ..      ..    &apos; ..      ..      ..    2(v) Co-operative Societies      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..    250Carried forward   ..   14

This body unites the district associations, and serves as an executive organ of the Coal Council in dealing with the district bodies. Appar-ently the voting rights of the syndicates are based upon output and sales effected, one vote being given per million tons in the last business year.The principle of joint management is introduced here also. The Supervising Council affords three places to manual workers, and one to salaried employees ; the Board of Management of the Imperial Coal Association has one place for the manual workers.The Imperial Association supervises the execution of the decrees of the Coal Council, issuing orders for that purpose. It will control consumption by the syndicates, and may restrict the sales in respect of area covered and quantity. Subject always to control by the Council, it will sanction conditions of delivery, adopted by the syndicates, adjust prices for delivery from the pit mouth, unloading stations, or coal yards.(iii) The State Government. The Department of Economics in conjunction with the Coal Council regulates the prices policy, of the industry. There is no compulsory syndicates-cation of merchanting, the consumer being adequately protected otherwise. Great stress is laid upon publicity of prices fixed by the National Department of Economics. Co-operative societies are to be treated on the same footing as wholesale merchants.As a general check upon distribution, annual price lists are to be issued giving prices upon which consumers can demand delivery upon certain conditions for cash, of at least a truckload (15 tons).The main features of the scheme are, therefore, exclusion of competition, joint management throughout the industry, control by a council representing various interests and assisted by expert committees, a general autonomy of the industry subject to regu-lation of prices policy. It is not clear whether the Coal Council may pursue a policy of abatement on prices to various. industries, but in any case this would appear to come within State regulation of prices. With regard to the question of the delimitation of the industry for socialisation purposes, there does not appear to be information upon the policy pursued towards mixed concerns such as rolling mills, blast furnaces, smelting works. On the other hand, gasworks producing coke for sale are compelled to syndicate, and be subject to the control of the Coal Council. The Majority Report of the Socialisation Committee recommended that extraction of by-products should be taken over with the industry, but not the further processes of chemical treatment.A short comparison of the scheme resulting from the German legislation with that recommended by the Sankey Report may be of interest. The chief feature of resemblance is the natural and pivotal position of the district organisation. The Sankey scheme makes the district more pivotal than the German (i) By putting consumers upon the District Council.(ii) By giving the workers equal representation thereon.The Local Council also in the English scheme gives a more definite status to the workers by giving them representation on a council to sit fortnightly at least, instead of remaining merely organised into a workers&apos; committee to meet the management.The district bodies are controlled in the Sankey scheme by the Minister for Mines, but in the German scheme by the autonomous National Council, the co-ordination of workers, consumer and commercial interests taking place in Germany over and above the purely vocational bodies, whereas in the English scheme this co-ordination is placed low down, and subjected to State control. In Germany the final control is by a Council of Interests, subject to State regulation of prices ; the Sankey scheme is final control by the State. This sums up the difference between autonomous socialisation and a transference to State control.In the present state of information a more detailed comparison of the two schemes would probably be. unsafe.Coal research Transport Steam boilers1 1 120(C 1842)A 2
Part II. Demobilisation and Eesettlement.Juveniles.The decline in unemployment which has been a feature of the last two months has&quot; been specially marked in the case of juvenile workers among whom, in fact, continuous improvement was first shown. The number of unemployed juveniles on the live registers of the Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 11th April was over 67,000. Keturns for the 27th June show that the number had declined to approximately 27,000, a reduction of a little under 60 per cent. The decrease in the number of those claiming out-of-work donation is even more marked, the decline in the same period being approxi-mately from 56,000 to 13,000, or nearly 77 per cent. The improvement is due to some extent to the fact that&apos; the reduced scale of donation has become applicable in many cases, and that the recipients have therefore allowed their claims to lapse. But the greater part of the reduction is undoubtedly to be attributed to a genuine improvement in the possi-bilities of employment. The decline is general in all divisions. Unemployment continues to be most marked in the North-Western Division, owing to the depression in the cotton trade.In consequence of this improvement it has become unnecessary to keep open a large number of the centres for the instruction of unemployed juveniles. During the first week in May the number of centres in the United Kingdom was 214, with over 21,000 boys and girls in attendance. At the beginning of July the number of centres had fallen to 95, and the number of boys and girls in attendance to a little over 4,000. The North-Western Division accounted for a quarter of this attendance, 25 centres being open in this one division. About half of the juvenile workers actually in receipt of unemployment donation .are receiving instruction in these centres.An interesting development in this connection has been the recent grant to the Board of Education of a sum of, money from the National Relief Fund; to be applied to the training of juveniles who have been in receipt of out-of-work donation and have attended * these unemployment centres. It is estimated that the grant will be sufficient to provide some 1,500 to 2 000 &quot; war scholarships &quot; in England and Wales. It will be possible to provide continuous instruction for a considerable time for a number equal to about half of the juveniles now attending centres. At the same time, the pressure under the unem-ployment donation scheme will be relieved to some extent, as the recipients of scholarships will naturally not be entitled to draw the donation. The Board of Education are now inviting local authorities to establish training schemes, and propose to pay maintenance grants from this fund during the period of training. This may cover a year or more, and in any case will not be for a period less than six months. The allowances proposed corn-pare very favourably with those authorised by the Treasury under the training schemes established for women. They amount to 15s. a week for juveniles of either sex under the age of 16, 17s. 6dfor those between the ages of 16 and 17, and 20s. for those over 17.The general evidence indicates that, while the class of openings available for juvenile workers varies considerably in different parts of the country, the general level is not unsatisfactory. No difficulty has been experienced in placing juveniles who have just left school. The resumption of normal conditions appears to be most marked in the West Midlands Division, where vacancies for juveniles are plentiful and of a good type. In London the work, though increased in volume, has hitherto tended to be of poor quality. Although in some exceptional cases war levels are maintained, wages are reported to be declining. This decline, however, has not generally been sufficient to lead to the refusal of work with good prospects on the ground that the starting wage is too low.The settlement of the juvenile workers is, throughout the country, carefully watched by the Juvenile Advisory Committees.In view of the unsatisfactory state of affairs as regards the apprenticeship system in many trades, evidence of which continues to accumulate in connection with the scheme for the resumption of interrupted apprenticeships, it is interesting to note that steps are being taken in various centres to promote the training of juveniles on entering industry. In Norwich, for example, steps have been taken to assist juvenile workers who, on account of war conditions, have been in abnormal employment.As a result of negotiations between the Juvenile Advisory Committee and repre-sentatives of the Trade Sub-Committees of the Norwich Employment Committee, a scheme of short-time apprenticeships has been elaborated.. It covers the building trades together with cabinet making, upholstering and French polishing, motor engineering, and printing. The scheme is being carried out through the Apprenticeship Sub-Committee of the Juvenile Advisory Committee, who are responsible for interviewing employers in order to obtain vacancies and for the selection of boys and girls from the live register to fill them.
A number of juvenile workers are already serving short-time apprenticeships. At Sheffield, again, a Building Trades Sub-Committee of the Juvenile Employment Committee has heen set up to revive the system of apprenticeship, to review all cases of applicants who desire to enter the industry as apprentices, or to transfer from one branch of the industry to another. This step was taken as the result of a conference between building trades operatives and employers, called to consider a draft scheme of apprenticeship formulated by the Juvenile Employment Committee.Part III.-Press Comments. -(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.Anglo-French Treaty.The discussion upon the Treaty of Peace as a whole, which has been a constant feature of the Labour and Socialist weekly press for so long time, would seem now to have exhausted itself. There are only indirect references to the Treaty of Peace in the papers reviewed this week. Their attention is turned from the main work of the Peace Conference to its more personal and more domestic issues. Mr. Philip Snowden discusses in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; the two treaties that have been made with France by England and America to protect France against any future German aggression. He suggests that they provide for a military alliance between England, America and France, and that they prove the unjust and unstable character of the Treaty of Peace. They are, he thinks, -an admission that the League of Nations is of no value as a preventive of aggression. He asserts that the Anglo-French Treaty, in particular, means the maintenance of a. large army in this country, which can only be recruited by conscription. &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, heartily rejoices at the prospect of the Treaties. Though the Treaties only deal with the defence of France, this paper hopes that they may be the kernel of a wider understanding, and expresses the opinion that such a Triple Alliance as might then be formed would be the only sound basis of a League of Nations. The &quot; Nation &quot; adopts an opposite view to this, and expresses the opinion that there is guarantee enough for France in the Covenant of the League, which can only be weakened by a repetition of the guarantee in a sectional agreement.The House of Commons Speeches on the Peace Treaty.Of the three speeches made in the House of Commons on the 3rd July, that of Sir Edward Carson receives no notice in these papers, that of Mr. Adamson is noticed only by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; but that of the Prime Minister is the subject of much comment. In a leading article the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; suggests that there was no resemblance at all between the Prime Minister&apos;s speech and the actual terms of the Treaty ; and complains that the speech was flatly contradictory to his statements before the armistice. &quot; He even went so far as to justify the harsh terms of the Treaty on the ground that the German people, must be punished for their complicity in the war ? &quot; &quot;He ignored the annexation of the Saar Valley, the transfer of vast areas of East Prussia to the Poles, the attempt to force upon the unwilling Danes territory in Schleswig-Holstein, and the transfer to France, without consultation with the people, of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, where the overwhelming majority of the population is German in race and speech.&quot; &quot; Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s justification of the Treaty, like the Treaty itself, is based upon the audacious lie that Germany was solely responsible for the war.&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald regards the Prime Ministers speech as &quot; an official reply to General Smuts&apos; manifesto.&quot; Mr. Macdonald criticizes Mr. Adamson&apos;s speech as missing every weak point in the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, and mentions the points that ought to be raised on the second reading debate on the Treaty of Peace Bill the Polish frontiers, the economic settlement, Schleswig-Holstein and the new &quot; Triple Alliance.&quot; Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; makes this his chief criticism of the Prime Ministers speech: &quot;Not one word did he say bearing on the all-important point as to whether the pledges on which the armistice was arranged had been kept.&quot; The comment of &quot; The Call&quot; is : &quot; Mr. Lloyd George treated his listeners to an interpretation of the Treaty which was a complete and cynical travesty of plain facts.&quot;The Trial of the ex-Kaiser.The topic of Foreign Affairs, which arouses the greatest interest, however, is the trial -of the ex-Kaiser. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; says that the purpose * of this trial is to divert attention from the important features of the Peace Treaty.  He
suggests that the Kaiser is not to be tried on the general ground of having meditated, and provoked the war, because, &quot; even with a packed jury of his enemies,&quot; &quot; an indictment on that ground would probably end in the prisoner and accusers changing places between the dock and the bench.&quot; Mr. C. H. Norman contributes to the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; and to &quot; Forward &quot; an article on this subject. He considers that theTe are two main objections to the trial of the ex-Kaiser. First of all, he says, there is no Court composed of. representatives of the Allies which would dare to acquit him, even though the evidence warranted such a course. Secondly, his extradition from Holland means a &quot; complete destruction of the right of asylum for political offenders in Europe.&quot; His conclusion is :. &quot; by all means let the Kaiser be tried, but there are. others in whose trial Englishmen, should take a deeper and more painful interest.&quot; Among the people he thinks might be tried are Mr. Asquith, Viscount Grey, Viscount Haldane, &quot;Die Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for War, Viscount Northcliffe, the Lord Privy Seal, the members of the Army Council and the judges of the High Court. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot;&apos; deals ironically with the subject. His opinion is that this trial is to be a &quot; circus-show to keep the people bound to the chariot wheels of the conqueror.&quot; Mr. F. W. Jowettfs comments, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; and the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; are similar. The &quot;Nation&quot; urges that an examinaiton of the case against the Kaiser brings out moral evil rather than legal crime and that, in any case, a trial would be an invitation to Germany to make a martyr of him. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; doubts whether the trial will ever take place and shares the opinion of. the &quot; Nation &quot; that such a trial might make a martyr of the ex-Kaiser, and that the invasion of Belgium is not a legal crime. It recognises that the trial will not be so much a criminal trial as a political impeachment, but maintains that the agreement that the death sentence is not to be inflicted, makes the trial an. absurdity. &quot;The Call&quot; thinks that the proposed trial is &quot;part of the settled policy of the ruling class to distract the attention of the masses from the tremendous social-revolutionary struggle which is taking place on the continent.&quot;Russia and Hungary.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; concludes that the Government is disturbed about the demonstrations to be held on the 20th and 21st July against intervention in Russia,.and attributes to this disturbed feeling the recent announcement in the Press about the with-drawal of British troops from Russia. It urges Labour, however, not to slacken its protests but to continue to insist that all assistance, in any form, to &quot; Russian reactionaries &quot;&apos; should cease. &quot; Justice &quot; contains two articles on Bolshevism in Hungary. In one. Mr. Alexander Broz maintains that to make peace with Bolshevism is a superfluous and hopeless task because they will never keep it: in the other, Mr. G. I). Herron alleges that the Allied and Rumanian troops were prevented from capturing Budapest because of orders from Paris issued in the interest of certain concessionnaires who had come to an understanding with Bela Kun with regard to the Banat. This paper, too, maintains that the nation has a right to receive a full explanation of the policy that is being pursued with regard to Russia and suggests that intervention is strengthening rather than weakening the Bolshevists. The &quot;Nation&quot; gives an incoherent account of Allied relations with Hungarian and Russian Bolshevism. The article contains not a single definite date, and its account of Hungarian affairs differs from that of &quot; Justice.&quot;Other.&quot; The Call&quot; publishes a document called &quot; The Guiding Lines of the Communist International,&quot; and also the &quot; Draft Construction of the Second International &quot; as proposed by the Acting Committee of the Berne Conference. The &quot;Clarion&quot; gives instances to prove the thesis it put forward last week that the problems of international affairs are far too complicated for any one country or party to possess a monopoly of wisdom in the settling of them, least of all the Labour Party. &quot; Justice &quot; attacks the French Socialists for the attitude they are adopting towards M. Clemenceau. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; says that judging from the tone of international conferences, we are losing our popularity on the Continent, where jealousy of England and America prevails; * and as regards our relations with America he suggests that the need both parties will be under at the next election of bidding for the Irish vote, will result in an anti-English policy.* Gf. his opinion in the 10th May issue of this paper (Report, 14th May, p.. 6),..
(B) Home Affairs.Direct Action.*The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot; contain special articles on this subject.  In the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; Mr. T. C. Morris, a member of the Executive of the Labour Party, first of all deals with the subject historically, and maintains that &quot; direct action &quot; is no new thing.  The Southport resolution, in his opinion, owes its momentous character, not to any novelty it may possess, but to the fact that it marks . a revolt against the present social system on the part of the workers who are calling for an immediate change.&apos; The Parliamentary machine is not working quickly enough. Mr. Morris, however, himself still has faith in the efficiency of political methods, and thus he is not willing to assume any responsibility for the decision, but puts the blame for it upon the Prime Minister and his colleagues, who, he alleges have brought Parliament into disfavour with the workers.  The Labour movement, he thinks, is being forced into its present line of action, which he insists is revolution.   &quot; Lloyd George and his Coupon Government have sown the wind: they will yet reap the whirlwind.&quot;  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; publishes a picturesque letter from Mr. R. Stephenson who, as a unit in the Triple Alliance, confesses he has no love for &quot; direct action.&quot;  His objection to &quot; direct action &quot; is that its success postulates a plastic, obedient and uncritical rank and file : and he does not think that this is at all desirable in consideration of the ultimate purposes of Socialism.   &quot; We must keep in mind that&apos; direct action&apos; is a double-headed monster, one head bearing the face of Robert Smillie and the other of Mr. Havelock Wilson.&quot;  The &quot; Nation &quot; deals with the matter philosophically and concludes that there is something more in the movement than mere discontent with the present Parliament.   At present the democratic political machine is organised according to localities, and the &quot;keener, stronger and more organised interests and needs &quot; of the citizens as producers in separate industries are ignored.   The demand for &quot; direct action,&quot; considers the &quot; Nation,&quot; is an irregular assertion of this suppressed element in popular self-government.   &quot; Unless organic reforms are introduced into the electoral system, this trouble will grow.&quot; : In reviewing the present political situation, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald expresses the opinion that &quot;those of us who still cling to our trust in Parliamentary methods and ordered progress are to have a difficult battle to fight.&quot;   &quot;Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot;Forward,&quot; analyses the attempts which have been made to justify the Southport resolution, and makes two comments.   Firstly, he considers that many of the attacks on the present Government are so hasty, ill-considered and imperfectly informed that they do more damage to the attackers than the attacked. Secondly, he recommends his readers not to exaggerate the importance of the last election and of the present Parliament; neither must they put down the results to a temporary aberration of mind on the part of the electorate.   &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; therefore, has no faith in the special pleas which have persuaded, for example, Mr. Snowden and Mr. Macdonald to defend the Southport resolution.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is very critical of the resolution and of the. Triple Alliance leaders.   It suggests that these leaders should first of all ascertain the opinions of their own members before asking other unions to join in &quot; direct action,&quot; passing their &quot; pious resolutions &quot; at the Labour Party Conference and agitating for a special meeting of the T.U.C.Russia Demonstrations.&quot; Justice &quot; asks whether there may not be sinister influences behind the proposed simultaneous demonstrations in England, France and Italy. The resolution that is to be put before these demonstrations is criticised. &quot; Justice &quot; asks what has been done to overthrow the so-called Socialist Republics of Germany and Austria, ,and insists that the juxtaposition of Russia, Germany, Hungary and Austria in the resolution is ridiculous. Why, asks this paper, should the Italians protest against intervention in Russia, in which the Italian Government has taken no part ? &quot; Justice &quot; finally expresses its long continued distrust of Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and asks how far he pledged the Labour Party to a strike movement in favour of Russia, in the course of his Italian journey. Mr. F. Willis, in &quot; The Call,&quot; maintains that it is the duty of B.S.P. to use every effort to &quot; save Russia,&quot; and uses what he claims to be the success of the B.S.P. in leading the Labour Party to approximate to its policy, as an argument for the continued presence of the B.S.P. in the Labour Party. Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; urges the workers to &quot; down tools &quot; On the 21st July.* Cf. Report, 9th July, pp. 25 and 26.
Nationalisation.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; describes &quot; the surrender of the Govern--ment to the opponents of the Ways and Communications Bill &quot; as a triumph for those who are hostile to Nationalisation. Mr. Smillie and Mr. Hodges have communicated to a re-porter of the Merthyr &quot;Pioneer&quot; their opinions on the political situation the Sankey report has created.  Mr. Smillie said : &quot; The miners are determined that the mines should be nationalised.  Action must be taken if the Government are prevented from carrying, out their solemn promise.&quot; Mr. Hodges said : &quot;If the Government refuse to fulfil their pledges, industrial action will inevitably be taken.&quot;  Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the. &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; insists that the Government by expressly accepting the whole of the first Sankey report is pledged to abolish the present system, and suggests that Lord Gain-ford^ statement that the colliery proprietors prefer nationalisation to any form of effective. joint-control leaves no alternative for the Government.to adopt but nationalisation.  The Woolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; expresses the opinion that the case for nationalisation is only made ..stronger by the announcement of the proposed increase&apos;in the price of coal: and this opinion is also held by the &quot; New Statesman.&quot;  The &quot; New Age &quot;&apos; is of the opinion that the object of the present agitation against nationalisation of the coal mines is the extraction. . of a maximum amount of compensation.  This papar thinks that the Sankey report has been exceedingly welcome to the coal owners and capitalist classes and calls upon the. Miners&apos; Federation to refuse the Sankey scheme.* The &quot; British Citizen &quot; doubts whether our State organisation is well enough developed, as yet, to justify a &quot; key &quot; industry being placed at the moment in the hands of State officials.  &quot; The Call &quot; expresses the opinion that the proceedings in Parliament on the Ways and Communications Bill show that we are still far from nationalising the mines.The Treaty of Peace Bill.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, in the &quot;Workers&apos;&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot; contend that the operative section of this Bill is in reality an indefinite extension, of the powers conferred upon the Government by the Defence of the Realm Act.womens Emancipation Bill.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; congratulates Mr. Spoor on the defeat, of the Government on the third reading of this Bill. He acknowledges that the &quot; Labour Party did remarkably well last week,&quot; but adds &quot;the criticism at Southport has evidently &apos; bucked them up.&apos; &quot; The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; presses upon the notice of its women, readers its opinion that the &quot; emancipation &quot; of women, when it does come, will be due in, no small measure to the Labour Party. Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs comment is that, viewed, in the light of the Russian Revolution, this defeat of the Government is a matter of little importance, but &quot; in the days when no hope of a change of system showed on the horizon,&quot;&quot; the Labour Party did not think women&apos;s enfranchisement important.General Federation of Trade Unions .fThe &quot; Nation &quot; thinks that the annual conference of this body at Scarborough has finally disposed of the last vestige of pretence that the Federation can in the future take any influential part in labour affairs outside the narrow limits of. disputes and strikes... The &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; on the other hand, thinks that the meeting was satisfactory, and is pleased with the tendency to confine the business of the meeting strictly to. Federation matters.Other.The &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; New Statesman &quot; both contain articles dealing with National Finance. &quot;Justice&quot; maintains its especial interest in the Food Consumers Council.. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals with &quot; Wages and Production &quot; and the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act. In the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; Mr. Charles Jesson, M.P., continues his series of articles on Industrial Unrest, and the &quot; Democrat&quot; (which is now no longer the official organ of the N.F.T.U., but is managed on Mr. W. A. Appleton&apos;s own responsibility) con-tinues its expositions of orthodox political economy. Mr. J. Jones, M.P., in &quot;Justice,&quot; expresses the opinion that the Government is tottering, to its fall.* Cf. Report, 9th July, p. 27.&apos; ^ Cf. Report, 9th July, p. 30.
&apos; (2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Trade Unions and Ex-Soldiers.The &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; (11th and 14th inst.) publishes correspondence from the-managing director of Charles Roberts &amp; Co., Ltd., dealing with the strike of members of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Vehicle Builders, &amp;c, in the Horbury wagon building and repairing works of this company.* From the correspondence two facts emerge. This union, though at present it can supply no skilled wagon builders, does not wish for ex-soldiers to be trained in this trade until its members in the army have been demobilised. The other fact is that this firm is dissatisfied with the Ministry of Labour. The &quot; Yorkshire Post &quot; (12th inst.) complains that, while the G.N.R. men were prepared to strike in order to ensure that men who enlisted without the company&apos;s permission should be properly reinstated, men at one of the Lancashire depots of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company were contending that the returning men should take their places at the bottom of the promotion ladder, because in order to circumvent the recruiting regulations, they had left the Company&apos;s employment a short time before joining the army. The opinion was expressed, reports the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (16th inst.), at a meeting of the Leicester and District Iron Trades Federation that it was not proper treatment to give men two months training in a skilled trade and then throw them on the labour market. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; (10th inst.) thinks that Sir Douglas Haig &quot; went a shade beyond the line &quot;&apos; when he took the case of a rivetter in a boilermakers&apos; shop to show that a Trade Union had stopped a man from following an occupation for which he had been trained. This paper contends that no man could learn this job in two months, for which 7 years&apos; apprenticeship were normally required. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; compliments Mr. G. N. Barnes for his statement on the admission of ex-soldiers to trades in which they were not placed before the war. An allied topic, reports the &quot; Dundee Advertiser &quot; (9th inst.), was discussed at a meeting in Arbroath of the local Employment Committee. In some trades, it was pointed out, unemployment among.demobilised apprentices was general, owing to the necessary engagement of new apprentices during the&apos; war. The feeling was expressed that in cases preference was being given over lads who had voluntarily enlisted to apprentices who had remained in employment until called up by the military authorities.Women in Industry. The Southampton branch of the National Association of Dis-charged Sailors and Soldiers, reports the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (14th inst.), has passed a resolu-tion expressing the opinion-with some reservations that the employment of women should be terminated wherever possible. Similar resolutions from local&quot; branches of ex-soldiers&apos; organisations were reported bv the &quot;Liverpool Post and Mercury&quot; (12th inst.), the &apos; &quot; Staffordshire Sentinel &quot; (10th inst.), and the &quot; Yorkshire Post&quot; (14th inst.).Part IV-General Topics and District Reports.(1) General.National Industrial Conference.The Joint Sub-Committee of the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial. Conference met on the 11th and 12th July, and considered the revised Minimum Wage and 48-hour Bills. The Bills were again discussed at a meeting of the Trade Union side of the Joint Committee on Wednesday, the 16th July.Nationalisation and the Coal Situation.The question of the Nationalisation of Coal Mines has been brought still further into prominence as the result of the Governmenfs announcement on the 9th July that the price of coal would be raised by 6s. per ton, and by its offer on the 14th inst. to defer the increase for three months if the Labour Party would engage that there should be no strikes or stoppages, and if the miners would do their best to increase output. Since the 10th July, the London and Provincial Press has been full of statements by leaders of almost every department of industry, drawing attention to the serious and even fatal effects that the increase would have on theiT particular industries, in view of the growing menace of foreign(C 1842)* Cf. Report, 9th July, p. 35.B
competition. The extreme Labour view, which was apparently shared to some extent by more moderate sections of the community until Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; speech on the 14th inst. dispelled the suspicion, was that the increase was dictated rather by &quot;political profiteering &quot; than by economic necessity. It was regarded as an attempt to set the con-sumer against the miner, and an endeavour to confuse the issue as between genuine nationalisation and State Control, which the extreme Labour leaders stigmatise as State-protected Capitalism. The attitude of the Miners on the whole question was fully stated at the Conference of the M.F.G.B. at Keswick, a summary of which appears below.Further resolutions against Nationalisation have been passed by the Provisional Grand Council of the Middle Classes Union, Hull Chamber of Commerce and Shipping, the British Empire Producers&apos; Association, West Yorkshire Coal Exchange, Cardiff Stock Exchange, South Wales Coal Exporters&apos; Association, and other bodies. A memorial against Nationali-sation signed by 300 Members of Parliament has been sent to the Prime Minister. On the other hand, various Labour organisations are still more strongly advocating nationalisa-tion. Resolutions recently reported have been passed by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the Forest of Dean Miners&apos; Association, the Bridgwater and Llanelly branches of the National Union of Railwaymen, and other bodies.The Miners&apos; Federation Conference. The Annual Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain was held at Keswick on the 15th July and the following days.At the opening session Mr. Robert Smillie delivered a presidential address, in which he surveyed the political and industrial field. Dealing first with political issues, he sin-cerely hoped that the efforts of the Federation would be used in the direction of killing conscription, which went hand in hand with militarism and imperialism, and he feared that there would not&quot; be a continuation of the capitalistic system without militarism and without war. With regard to Russia, he stated that the Russian people were entitled to work out their own emancipation and their social salvation, and our present intervention was one of the greatest crimes in the history of our country.. Mr. Smillie then spoke at some length on the proceedings and the findings of the Coal Commission, and referred in particular to the agitation with regard to nationalisation. He pointed out that they had certainly understood from the Prime Minister that if the inquiry of the Coal Commission produced facts to justify the majority in recommending nationalisation of the mines, the Government would consider it their duty to carry out the finding of the Commission. But at the present time they were witnessing an example of &quot; direct action &quot; in the House of Commons, taken by.the possessing class, the land owners, the mine owners, and the great commercial interests, using the whole of their political influence to prevent the nationalisation of the mines. Further, two by-elections were pending in mining con-stituencies, and he was convinced that the announcement of the 6s. per ton increase in price was a political move on somebody&apos;s part in order to turn the opinion of the nation against the miners. The miners wanted a full inquiry to ascertain if the 6s. increase was necessary, for they did not forget that when the Government increased the price by 2s. Qd. per ton they got  25,000,000 profit as a result With regard to output, he asserted that the Miners&apos; Federation was as anxious as any member of the Government to have the fullest possible output, and he denied that the miners were to blame for the reduced output. If as a result of an inquiry it were found that the miners were to blame, the whole power of the Federation would be used to put matters right, but if the employers were to blame they should be brought to book. It was not possible to get miners to do as much work in seven hours as they did in eight, but they believed that the output could be enormously increased under nationalisation, with resulting proper development, an extended use of machinery, and the elimination of dictatorial royalty-owners. In con-elusion, he stated that he wished to assure the Government that if they would act on the recommendations of the second Sankey Report, the miners would be behind them in fighting any organisation of employers, and in order to help the Government, they would pledge themselves to stop work.Mr. Harry Twist, Lancashire, then proposed the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted : &quot; That this Conference, having noticed the political and industrial pressure now being brought to bear on the Government with a view to getting it to ignore the recommendations of the Coal Commission as expressed in the report of the majority of the Commissioners on the second stage of the Commission^ work, inform the Govern-ment that, whilst the miners are not fully satisfied with the Report of Mr. Justice Sankey in all its details, they are prepared to give the Government their fullest support in carrying the recommendations of the Majority Report of the Commission into immediate effect.&quot;On the 16th July various resolutions were passed dealing with coroners&apos; juries for conducting inquests into fatal accidents in mines, the raising of the income-tax exemption
limit to  250 with the continuance of all present allowances, and the continuance of dependants&apos; allowances of discharged sailors and soldiers until they are physically able to earn a wage which, together with the pension, is equal to the wage now paid in their pre-war occupation. The most important decision of the day involved the rejection by a large majority of a resolution proposed by Mr. Warne, Northumberland, to the effect that on any question of national importance or on any other question already agreed to by a National Conference of Miners, the Executive Committee or a Conference of the Federation may call the miners out on strike without a ballot vote.On the 17th July the Conference considered the reply to be given to the Governments conditional offer to postpone the increase of the price of coal. Mr. Smillie stated, his attitude clearly, and maintained that the Government should first give some pledge that they are going to deal seriously with the question of nationalisation. If they would do that, Mr. Smillie thought that he could pledge the Conference and probably all the miners&apos; leaders and miners to do everything in their power to assist in the re-organisation of the collieries and the increase of output. Mr. G. Spencer, Mr. W. Brace, and Mr. Vernon Hartshorn spoke in favour of an acceptance of the Governments offer, but the Conference carried unanimously a resolution proposed by Mr. Frank Hodges in the following terms : &quot; This Annual Conference, having heard the report of the miners&apos; members of Parlia-ment upon the discussion in the House of Commons on the Governments proposal to raise the price of coal by 6s. per ton, declares that the increase is not necessary and should be avoided. It regards the problem as one of production only. It is of opinion that pro-duction can only be increased to a point which will make the industry self-supporting, without additional charges to the consumer, if the economies set forth in the first Sankey Report are effected, and the recommendations of the majority of the Commissioners as to an immediate change of ownership and control in the mining industry be passed into law. It therefore informs the Government that it is prepared to co-operate with the Government to the fullest extent to put such economies into effect and the recommendations into law.&quot;The Conference also passed a resolution advocating a 14&apos;3 per cent, increase on piece-rates.Direct Action.A joint meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress and of the Executive of the Labour Party was held at the House of Commons on the 9th July to consider the decision of the Southport Conference on direct action on political issues. There was some criticism by certain members of the Labour Party Executive of the action of the Parliamentary Committee in declining to call a special Trades Congress to discuss the proposal for direct action at the request of the Triple Alliance. The meeting separated without any conclusion having been reached, the decision as to what, if any, action should be taken resting with the Parliamentary Committee. The Parliamentary Committee again met on the 10th inst. to consider the matter, but after a- protracted discussion it adjourned till the 22nd July without reaching any definite decision. The opinion has been expressed that in view of the fact that the Trade Union Congress is to meet at the beginning of September, it is improbable that the Committee will call a special Conference. There is said to be a feeling among some of the Trade Union leaders that the question of direct action is too big a matter to be decided by any Conference, and that it should be decided by the rank and file of the Trade Unions by ballot vote of the members.Recent articles in criticism of certain aspects of direct action by Mr. Arthur Henderson, in the current issue of the monthly journal of the Ironfounders&apos; Trade Union, and by Mr. Vernon Hartshorn in the &quot; South Wales News &quot; are attracting much attention in Labour and other circles. The Executive Council of the National Socialist Party has passed a resolution deploring the fact that by passing an ill-considered resolution the Conference of the Labour Party at Southport should have conveyed to the country that the party counsels the-policy of a general strike for political purposes.Committee on Night Baking.The Committee on Night Baking appointed by the Minister of Labour has issued its report (Cmd. 246).  The following recommendations are made : (i) That no person shall be employed for hire in the manufacture of bread or flour-confectionery between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., except in certain cir-cumstances which are specified in the Report. Detailed conditions are laid down under which alone these exceptions may be permitted.(ii) That provision should be made to enable leaseholders to alter premises and,plant in the event of lessors refusing consent.(C 1842) B 2
&apos;:(iii) That the responsible Minister, on the petition of the District&quot; Joint Industrial Council of the trade, or of any employer or employers&apos; association, or of any operative or operatives&apos; society, that employers in any town or place are subject to unfair competition in their trade by reason of bakers or confectioners not restricted under Clause (i) of these recommendations baking during pro-hibited hours, should, if satisfied after due inquiry that the petition is well * founded, issue an order extending to such bakers the same general prohibition as applies to men employed for hire.(iv) That the above provisions should come into operation at the expiration of two years after the passing of the necessary legislation, except where before the expiration of the two years a recommendation is made by a Joint Industrial Council or other representative joint body, or an agreement has been arrived at between organisations representative of employers and workers, that the provisions should become operative, when the responsible Minister should have powers to make the provisions immediately operative.-Engineering and Shipbuilding.Negotiations between the Engineering and National and the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federations and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions in connection with the demand of the latter for a 44-hour week, which seemed to have reached a deadlock at the conference in York on the 1st and 2nd July, are to be resumed at a further conference on the 17th July.  Th&apos;e employers conferred among themselves at Westminster on the 10th inst.The National Foremen&apos;s Association at its annual conference on the 13th July decided to ballot its members on the question of affiliating with the Trade Union Congress and with kindred organisations in the engineering trade. It was also decided that in trades disputes members of the Association should confine themselves to their ordinary super-visory duties. A proposal to institute a political fund was rejected. At the opening business session of the North East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders on the 9th July the position of women in the engineering industry was discussed.Dockers.The triennial delegate meeting of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union was held on the 7th, 8th and 9th July. Mr. Ben Tillett, M.P., proposed a resolution that no industrial action should be taken on the Triple Alliance resolutions before a special conference had been called by the Trade Union Congress, and a ballot vote of all the trade unions taken. Mr. Ben Tillett also moved a resolution calling upon the Government to cease to carry by rail merchandise which could be conveyed by coastal shipping or inland waterways, thereby relieving congestion in ports and on railways. Other delegates gave evidence of congestion in various ports (e.g., London, Tilbury, Plymouth, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Hull, and South Wales), and the resolution was carried unanimously. Other resolutions condemned the continued employment of female labour in industries more suitable for male labour, and protested against the War Office boycott of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; as &quot; a violation of the rights of the soldier to enjoy the liberty of the press equally with the civilian.&quot;Farmers.A meeting of the Council of the National Farmers&apos; Union was held in London, on the 9th July. A Working Agreement with the Agricultural Organisation Society was discussed, and a proposal for a Joint Committee of practical agriculturalists to confer with the Food Controller on the point of prices in accordance with the cost of production was approved. It was also announced that the Food Controller had agreed to consider the continuance of the increased price of milk if the drought was prolonged. The charge that farmers were responsible for profiteering was rebutted.Other Conferences.A conference of the Federation of Grocers&apos; Associations of the United Kingdom was opened in Liverpool on the 8th July. The presidential address contained hostile references to the continuance of food control.A conference of the National Federation of Newsagents, Booksellers and Stationers opened at Leicester on the 9th July, the object being to amalgamate the various trade organisations in the kingdom.  Thirteen out of fourteen points of the National Programme
were approved, including the elimination of street trading, a minimum profit of 33 per cent, on all publications and books, shorter hours, a charge for the delivery of newspapers, : no re-introduction of the halfpenny newspaper, and the establishment of a Witley Council.The 21st annual meeting of the Welsh Industries Association was held in London on the 8th July, when projects for the encouragement of domestic industries [e.g., wood-carving, lace-making, homespuns, &amp;c.) were formulated.International Trade Unionism.A joint meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress and the Executive of the General Federation of Trade Unions was held at the House of Commons on the 9th July to consider the reconstitution of the International Trade Union Movement as distinct from the International Political Movement. The new constitution and rules of the proposed International Trade Union Federation were considered, and the names of delegates to the Amsterdam International Trade Union Conference on the 28th July were announced. The agreement which has apparently been reached by the Parliamentary &apos; Committee and the Federation to aim at reconstituting the International Labour Movement on a trade union basis is of considerable importance, as it seems to indicate their intention to separate in their international relations from the various political socialist organisations on the Continent which claim to speak for Labour without any actual authority. The conference, which will be attended by representatives of the American Federation of Labour, and by delegates from Germany and German Austria, will discuss the international situation, in the light of the Peace settlement, and will prepare the Agenda for the Inter-national Congress to be held at Geneva in February, 1920.-Peace Celebrations.In many districts Labour leaders have intimated their disapproval of peace * celebrations on the 19th July. Exeter and Barrow-in-Furness Labour Parties have decided to take no part in these celebrations, and ex-Service organisations in Glasgow, -Sheffield, Luton and Barrow are opposing the celebrations. The Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives at Leicester has passed a resolution protesting against the loss of working time entailed, and urging members not to take part. At Birmingham, Leeds, Bradford, and Blackburn the Celebrations Committees are said to be meeting with difficulties due to the attitude of Labour elements.Russia Demonstrations.The decision of the Labour Party Conference at Southport in favour of Demonstrations on the 20th and 21st July against intervention in Russia and the Government^ reactionary policy appears to have been followed up. The British Socialist Party has issued a state-ment in which it says that it is prepared to take its share in organising these proposed demonstrations, but while the French and Italian workers are to manifest their solidarity with their Russian comrades by a general stoppage, the Party asks whether British labour is to content itself with mere demonstrations. It is reported that at Barnsley, Bradford;, Bristol, Derby, Hull, Leicester, Plymouth and Stoke, the demonstrations are to take place on the 20th. At Doncaster, Manchester and Devonport they will take place on the 21st. Merthyr miners have decided to &quot; down tools &quot; for one day on the 21st July, and it is stated that a &quot; down tools &quot; campaign for the same day is being organised in Glasgow.Income-Tax.The South Wales Miners&apos; Federation received on the 11th July a report from the Federation solicitor conveying counsePs opinion that the authorities were justified in collecting in the June quarter income-tax on the retrospective payment under the Sankey award of increased wages earned in March quarter. The Council recommended all workmen liable for the payment to avoid friction by paying claims forthwith. A meeting of the Cardiff Trades and Labour Council discussed a resolution of certain branches of the Boilermakers&apos; Society refusing to pay further income-tax on the present basis until the Government raised the abatement of  250. Several delegates spoke against the resolution, . and when it was put to the meeting, it was declared lost. Resolutions in favour of the raising of the exemption limit continue, however, to be passed by various Labour bodies. A mass meeting of workers in the building trade in Swansea and District passed a
resolution demanding the raising of the income4ax abatement level to  250, and similar resolutions are reported from the Teignmouth branch of the N.U.R., the employees of the Metropolitan Carriage Waggon and Finance Co., and Birmingham and Coventry Engineers.Holidays with Pay.Members of the National Union of Vehicle Workers in the Employment of the Regents Canal Company, and carmen, stablemen and motor-drivers employed by Messrs. J. Lyons &amp; Co., have obtained a week&apos;s holiday with pay.Co-operation.It is reported that the Co-operative Employees Union is beginning to recognise that the co-operative movement cannot in respect of wages successfully compete with the private trader, and it is understood that it is contemplating amalgamation with the Shop Assistants&apos; Union. On the other hand the Board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society has decided to withdraw from the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association. The Society owns mills at Bury, Radclifie, and Chawley.Two interesting instances of attempts to start co-operative factories on a small scale are reported. (1) Following on a recent strike of tailors in Birmingham, the workmen have opened their own workrooms where they are producing clothes under Trade Union conditions, and providing work for about 50, and ultimately 200, employees. (2) Strikers in the boot and shoe trade at Eyam (Derbyshire), in pursuit of their decision to start a Co-operative factory, have purchased an Army hut as temporary premises and acquired a field.Shop Stewards and Works Committees.It is reported that the chief Unions in the Engineering Trades are to ballot on a scheme for making the Works Committee official, and for giving official sanction to the new functions which have gradually during the last few years been assumed by shop stewards. This scheme is stated to be the result of a joint Conference between the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation and ten of the largest Engineering Unions, and the agreement, if sanctioned, will apply to the workers and employers enrolled. in these, organisations.According to this scheme, the appointment of shop stewards and of works committees is permissive, and it is stated that the intention of recognising this form of organisation is merely the avoidance of disputes. The method of appointing shop stewards remains in the hands of the Union concerned, and only Unionists will vote in their election. The: Works Committee is to be a joint concern, with equal representation of management and shop stewards; but, in any case, a representative of the department concerned is to be present when a question is being discussed. The shop steward is to act as inter-intermediary between the management and the workers in the first stages of a dispute, with power to refer the matter to the joint works committee if he cannot get a satisfactory settlement. It is agreed that no strikes may take place until all stages enumerated in, the &quot; Agreement for avoiding disputes &quot; have been passed.Amalgamation, &amp;c.A. ballot is now proceeding on the question of amalgamating all sections of labourers in the building industry, and on the 16th June a Conference was held in Manchester to consider the advisability of combining in one union societies catering, for masons, brick-layers, plasterers, slaters and tilers.Sub-Committees of the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E.F. have been conferring in London on the subject of closer unity between the two unions. The discussions have been friendly, and a further meeting will be held this week to develop the lines of policy so far evolved.. The Railway Clerks&apos; Association has removed a cause of dissension with the N.U.R. by withdrawing a circular which it issued with regard to the transfer of supervisors from the ; N.U.R. to the R.C.A. The South-Eastern District Council of the R.C.A. recommends a. triple alliance of the N.U.R., A.S.L.E.F. and R.C.A.A special delegate meeting of the Scottish Enginemen&apos;s and Boilermen&apos;s Association has decided in favour of federating with the M.F.G.B.
The dispute between the National Union of Paper &quot;Workers and the Book Binders is Bearing settlement. A temporary arrangement for the recognition of cards and transfers by agreement has been arrived at. Meanwhile, representatives of the two unions are to meet to draft a scheme of amalgamation.It is stated that balloting in the National Union of Journalists has so far gone strongly in favour of affiliation with the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation.A conference on amalgamation between General Labour Unions took place at York on the 10th July. The Workers&apos; Union, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, and the Municipal Employees&apos; Association have already combined forces, with a resulting membership of 600,000 (mainly unskilled and lesser skilled workers in 50 or 60 different occupations). If this combination agrees to enter the National Union of General Workers the aggregate membership would approach a million.It is reported that the amalgamation of the Postnien&apos;s Federation, the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association, and the Fawcett Association will probably be completed in September, under the title of &quot; The Union of Postal Workers.&quot;A Conference of Welsh Farmers&apos; Unions held at Shrewsbury, was strongly in favour of affiliation with the National-Farmers&apos; Union.The National Dental Association and the British Dental Union of Scotland have amalgamated.Ai-hour Week.Reference is made above to the negotiations for a 44-hour week in the engineering and shipbuilding trades. The provisional agreement reached in the Papermaking Trade provides for a 44-hour week for night-workers. The strike of plumbers in the Potteries district for -a 44-hour week continues. A demand for a 44-hour week is included in the national programme of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers and Confectioners, and a similar demand has been made by Sheffield Gardeners.Unemployment Donation Statistics.The figures of unemployment donation policies remaining lodged on the 27th June grouped under different industries, show that the highest percentages of policies lodged to the total number of workers in industry are (1) in Insured Industries, in Engineering and Ironfounding, 6*02 per cent., and in Building and Works of Construction, 5*85 per cent., and (2) in Uninsured Industries, so far as reliable figures are available, in Conveyance of Men, Goods and Messages, 10*10 per cent. The lowest percentages are, under (1), Ammunition 0&apos;47, and under (2), Agriculture, 0&apos;86.Housing.The Joint Housing Committee of the Federation of British Industries and the National Alliance of Employers and Employed has issued a statement regretting the fact that the Government Housing Bill does not provide for the terms of financial assistance to be given to public utility societies being as favourable as those to local authorities.Court of Arbitration.During the week ended the 12th July, 1919, the Court heard 22 cases ; 16 in London, 4 in Manchester, 2 in Sheffield and 1 in Newcastle.Engineering. The claim of employees in the engineering industry for a wage increase of 15s. a week, and the counter-claim of the employers for a 5s. reduction of war-bonus have both been disallowed by the Court. . i, Joint Industrial Councils.Building Resettlement Committee.-k meeting of this Committee was held on the 9th July, with, regard to the necessity of augmenting the supply of Building Trade Labour, in view of the Government Housing Schemes. It was decided to draw up a Report to be presented to the Industrial Council at the annual meeting in August, giving exact informa-tion as to the amount of building required to be done over a specified period, the number of men required for such work, the number of men now available for the work, an estimate of the amount of additional labour required and &apos;the best methods of obtaining such . additional labour.  The next meeting will be held on the 23rd July.
Electrical Contracting.-A meeting of the Council was held at Manchester on the 9th. and 10th July. Several hours were given to the drawing up of National Working &quot;Rules,, dealing with questions of overtime, holidays, night work, wages, tools, incompetent work-men, improvers, apprentices, dirty work, country work, travelling expenses, settlement of disputes, &amp;c. A long discussion took place on a proposal that the Council should deal with wages questions in place of the Committee on Production, and finally the question, was referred to the constituent bodies, with a view to the cancellation of present agreements and an acceptance of decisions of the Joint Industrial Council as final and binding.Electricity Supply. A meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held at Montagu House on the 10th July. The principal business of the meeting was the consideration of further arrangements for the formation of District Councils.Furniture. A meeting of the Council was held on the 9th July and was continued on the morning of the 11th July. On the 9th July, at the commencement of the pro-ceedings the Council met Sir David Shackleton with regard to the Manchester dispute. During the morning and afternoon of the 9th July, several abortive attempts at separate meetings of the two sides were made to arrive at some agreement, It was agreed finally to resume the Joint Industrial Council meeting at about 4 o&apos;clock, and a discussion took, place with regard to the negotiations that had taken place between both sides through the Ministry of Labour, during the interval that elapsed between the failure of the National Conciliation Board to settle the Manchester dispute and the date on which the men came out on strike. This discussion considerably cleared, the air, and at an adjourned meeting on.&apos; the 11th&quot;July, the Operatives side made the following offer : &quot;We are prepared to ask the Manchester and East Lancashire members at mass meetings as-to whether they are prepared to resume work pending the National Conference.&quot;This offer was subsequently accepted by the employers on the following terms: &quot; In view of the situation that has arisen and in consequence of the information now come to light at the meeting of the Joint Industrial Council on Wednesday last, we are willing to accept your resolution on condition that a decision is conveyed to the adjourned Joint Industrial Council meeting, on Friday, the 18th July, at 10.30 a.m.&quot;&apos;Even if this solution means only temporary postponement of a general lock-out by the employers, it is very satisfactory from the point-of-view of the Joint Industrial Council that they were able with the help of the Department to alleviate the situation, whiclu almost to the last hour, appeared hopeless.Local Authorities Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers). The two sides of the Joint Industrial Council met separately at Montagu House on the 10th July at 10.45 a.m.,. and a full meeting&apos; of the Council was held at 11.45 a.m. The chief business of the full meeting was to consider the resolution on wages, moved by the Trade Union side on the 4th July, which the Employers&apos; side had promised to submit to their Constituent Associa-tion for consideration. The subsequent discussion showed clearly that both sides earnestly desire that the Council should not be dissolved, and it was significant that the one or two members of the Trade Union side who have hitherto expressed suspicion of Joint Industrial Councils, and threatened to bring about the dissolution of the Non-Trading Services Joint Industrial Council remained silent.Packing Case Making Executive Committee. At a meeting of the Executive Committee held on the 27th June, it was resolved to recommend to the Council at their next meeting that the rates of pay for packing case makers and sawyers, both male and female, be not less than the minimum rate current in the various districts, but it would be permissible for the employers to pay their men any additional sum that the men may earn based on piece-work rates.Trade Boards.New Trade Boards.-The Minister has established a Trade Board for the Paper Bag: Trade (Great Britain) and has signed the Regulations with respect to its Constitution. and Proceedings. He has also signed the Regulations for the Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain).Hollow-Ware Trade Board (Great JBnfam).-The Hollow-ware Trade Board (Great Britain) have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 12th July, 1919, to vary the general rnmimum time-rate for female workers of 18 years of age and upwards from 18s. per week of 54 hours to 30s. 9d. per week of 47 hours, with corresponding increases in the general minimum time-rates for female learners.
Shirtmalcing Trade Board (Great Britain).

The Tin Box Trade Board (Great Britain) have agreed to request the Minister of Labour to make binding by an Order under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, the rates of wages contained in an agreement between the British Tin Box Manufacturers&apos; Federation and certain Trade Unions, and have resolved to issue on the 28th July, 1919, a Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates for male and female workers in accordance with this agreement.Special Order. The Minister has made a Special Order applying the Trade Boards Acts to the Rope, Twine and Net Trade.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The decrease in unemployment, as recorded by the Exchange live registers, continues, though to a less marked degree. It is mainly attributed, however, to the review of out-of-work donation cases by the Local Employment Committees.Resettlement. Few fresh developments are recorded. Although much building work is reported to be required in the Ramsgate and Margate districts, it is stated that con-tractors will not tender owing to the absence of building labour. Importation is hampered by the fact that local rates are lower than the London rates, and that men employed on other than building work at Richborough also receive higher rates. It is stated that housing schemes in West Ham cannot be proceeded with owing to the lack of suitable sites in this congested area.Local Employment Committees are strongly urging the necessity for rapid progress with training schemes for ex-Service men, whether disabled or non-disabled.General. Unrest prevails in all parts of the area and continued threats and strikes are expected.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The decline in unemployment continues satisfactory. Local increases are reported at Leicester and Loughborough in consequence of strikes, and at Luton and Chelmsford.Resettlement. Lack .of housing and insufficient transport facilities continue to impede progress. The release of raw materials and of pivotal men is also said to be necessary At King&apos;s Lynn complaints are reported as to alleged delay in the issue or refusal of export licences, and consequent congestion among ships clearing from the port.South-Western.Unemployment. A general improvement in the industrial situation is reported from Southampton and Weymouth, but in the neighbourhood of Winchester there are many discharges from Government works. Unemployment among women is reported to be assuming disquieting dimensions at Portsmouth.Resettlement. The bill for a hydro-electric power scheme on Dartmoor is not to be proceeded with this session. The transfer of a factory for rainproof material to Swindon is expected to find employment for all women on the Exchange register in three weeks&apos; time Road-making operations near Truro are being commenced. The development of railway transport in Devonshire and Cornwall, it is reported, would greatly assist commercial and agricultural projects ; the preliminaries of two schemes are well advanced.(C1842) C
General. The labour situation as a whole in this area is stated to remain very favour-able. One or two minor disputes are reported, and there is a little unrest in the building trade more particularly in the Isle of Wight and at Plymouth.State ownership of the fishing industry is suggested as a remedy for the state of affairs in Devon and Cornwall, where the low prices realised for fish tempt fishermen to throw part of their catches overboard.West Midlands.Unemployment. A substantial decline in unemployment is again reported, the largest decrease being in Birmingham, and in Dudley and Stourbridge, where the decline is due to the settlement of the strike on the Earl of Dudley&apos;s estates.Resettlement. It is stated that firms are getting gradually into their stride and that the reabsorption of labour is taking place slowly but effectively. Complaints still continue of the shortage of rolling stock, of housing and of coal. Many manufacturers represent that they cannot consider extensive changes of plant owing to uncertainty as to excess profits tax returns in connection with which, in some cases, have not been received for two years.General-Uhe situation in this area may be described as uneasy but not turbulent.A committee representative of every branch of the engineering trade has been ap-pointed to consider what steps are to be taken to give effect to the decision of the engineers&apos; societies in Coventry not to work with non-union labour.At a meeting of the members of the A.S.E. a resolution has been carried urging the Executive to obtain a national minimum of  5 for a 44-hour week.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The latest returns show that unemployment continues to decrease, the decline in the number on the live register being most marked in Leeds and district, and in Sheffield and Attercliffe&apos;.Resettlement. In the Keighley district the lack of comb minders is reported to be hindering the production of wool tops. The scarcity of these workers is attributed to the fact that the wages for labouring are as good as those in the mill, and that the comb minders consequently prefer to work out of doors.The Lincoln ironmasters have expressed willingness to take over the camp at Brocklesby in order to cope temporarily with the housing difficulty at Scunthorpe. The completion of this arrangement will provide for the employment of a large number of men in the Scunthorpe and Frodingham district.North-Western.Unemployment.-^^ live register for the week ending the 4th July shows a slight increase. This is due, however, to the effects of the cotton strike, and outside the cotton areas a decline continues. The occupations showing the largest number of unemployed are engineering, cotton (textile), conveyance by road, and general labouring.Resettlement. The Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Trades and Labour Councils recently recommended working men representatives to abstain from attending meetings of the Local Employment Committees and Courts of Eeferees until&quot; the Minister of Labour is prepared to grant executive powers to&apos; the Committees.&quot; One or two Employment Committees have passed similar resolutions. No definite statement, however, is made as to the direction in which it is proposed to exercise the desired powers.In various textile centres a definite shortage exists of certain types of skilled workers; Loose pattern moulders and pattern makers are needed in a number of engineering centres, and until the moulding shops attain maximum output, no great improvement can be expected in the engineering trade. .The Northwich chemical and salt industry is quiet, and Messrs. Brunner, Mond and Co., Ltd., are dismissing employees from their Lostock Grralam works.General. The resumption of work recommended by the Labour leaders on the settlement of the cotton strike is the outstanding feature in the general position, which otherwise remains unaltered.Northern.Unemployment. The decline in unemployment indicated by the latest returns ia small.
Part V.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Coal Miners.South Wales. The &quot; rubbish &quot; dispute at Mountain Ash, whioh involved 5,000 miners, - has been tentatively settled, the men having returned to work pending negotiations. Men on strike about house coal at Nantgarw have been advised by their leaders (after conference with the Coal Controller) to return to work pending a revision of price lists, but the advice has been rejected by ballot. At Port Talbot 3,000 men struck on the 15th inst. over the adjust-ment of working shifts, and in the Neath district the lack of railway facilities to meet the new conditions is throwing several thousands idle. In Monmouthshire 20,000 surfacemen are refusing to work unless they are given the same terms as the underground workers. The M.F.G.B. has condemned their action.(C 1842)C2Resettlement.-^ building industry is reported to be hampered by the shortage of skilled labour, the high cost of labour and materials, some shortage of constructional iron-work, and inadequate transport facilities for bricks. Shortage of railway wagons, the lack of skilled labour and want of housing accommodation are affecting the stone quarrying industry.A new shipyard is being laid down at Hebburn, and one or two small brickyards are being reopened. Boring operations are in hand for coal at Wittle and Newton-on-the-Moor, and also for iron ore. It is reported, however, that the housing problem may prove a difficulty.General. The question of reinstatement of conscientious objectors on the railways is attracting attention and the view which is expected to prevail is that they were blameless in taking advantage of legally provided exemption and that it was the duty of any union which retained them as members and accepted their money to see that their jobs were kept for them.Wales.Unemployment. A further small decline in unemployment is shown by the latest returns, but the position remains substantially unchanged.Resettlement. Sectional strikes, shortage of railway wagons and workmen&apos;s trains., and housing difficulties continue to hamper resettlement. Depression in the steel and sheet steel industries is said to be likely to continue owing to the prohibitive cost of material and the loss of foreign markets. Operations at the new works of Messrs. Baldwin, Ltd., near Swansea, are progressing rapidly, and it is hoped that much employment will be provided very shortly. The driving of a new colliery drift at Clyne in the Vale of Neath is expected to lead shortly to opportunities for a large amount of employment. There is little surplus labour in the district, however, and no housing accommodation for imported labour. The Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Co., Ltd., have installed a new seamless tube mill which will increase the number of their employees.General. The industrial situation is still unsettled. Scotland.Unemployment. A general decrease in unemployment is again reported, the decline in Glasgow being over 2,000 and in Edinburgh over 1,000. In the Hamilton area un-employment has been caused among miners by the collapse of a shaft and the closure of a colliery for repairs and at Mother well through lack of equipment and experience^ Col-lieries in the Dunfermline area show improvement but the whole industry is stated to be unsettled by doubt as to the Governments policy as to nationalisation. There is still increasing unemployment among women in some areas but in Greenock, Dunfermline and to some extent in Paisley prospects are improving. The position in Ayr is still serious. In many areas unemployment is still extensive among ex-Service men.Resettlement. In the jute trade, orders are stated to be secured for a year ahead, and full working time is still in operation. There is a general improvement in the timber trade. An improvement is reported from the flax centres, but the stock of flax is estimated as sufficient only for four months. It is believed that there is a year&apos;s supply in Russia, and a Government committee has been appointed to study the question.
North Wales,-At Gresford Colliery (one of the largest in North Wales) the men are idle owing to a dispute about the arrangement of shifts.Scotland. A conference of owners and men has recommended terms of settlement of the Polton dispute. At a pit at Lochore 1,000 men are on strike because, it is alleged, the bad condition of the roads makes it impossible for piece-workers to earn a fair day&apos;s wage. The strike is unofficial. Many collieries are idle in Dumbarton and Fifeshire owing to disagree-ment about hours.In view of the non-settlement of the dispute at Bedlay Colliery, the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Executive decided to enforce a day&apos;s county stoppage next week, but further conferences have been held at the instance of the Coal Controller. Another dispute in Lanarkshire exists at the Dewhill Colliery, where promised wage advances have been withheld..Yorkshire. A strike of 150,000 miners commenced on the 15th inst. because the West Yorkshire owners withdrew their offer of 14*3 per cent, on piece rates, and a deadlock ensued on the question of hours. Engineering works are having to close down, and even the pump-men have now been withdrawn. An agreement has been reached with South Yorkshire owners, but the men are standing idle till the &quot;West Yorkshire dispute is settled.Kent. Three Kentish collieries, employing 1,300 men, have been idle since the 15th inst. over the adjustment of hours.

Roberts &amp; Company&apos;s Railway Wagon and Wheel Works, Horbury (near Wakefield) continues.
