[m DOCUMENT Io THE FR0E.RTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S g^MlgffiJC R S I.1189 &quot; (WAR   CABINET.S^l^Z- KEilNSTAT&amp;MT Off CIVIL aERVIOE gOfeOMjIOUS OBJECTORS.Memorandum from the Treasury.,With referenda to H.A.C. 31st Minutes^ No.5, relative to the reinstatement of Civil Service conscientious objeotora, it is understood that the Comraitteo wishei further consideration to be given to the various casos of Civil  servants who failed to&quot; obtain exemption on conscientious grounds.    These men may be groupod into four sub-divisions:-(a) Men who wore passed by tho Central Tribunal and v&amp;o have worked satisfactorily under the Braoe Committee,    It may be eaud that theso men have been recognised by the Qovororaent as entitled to exemption on conscientious grounds, and it is proposed that they should be treated in the same way as tho men who obtained exemption from ordinary Tribunals.(b) Man who were passed by the Central Tribunal and undertook work under the Braoe Committee but behaved badly or broke the conditions of rolease and had to be reoallod to prison or tothe Army.    Theso man should not be re-employed.(c) Men who applied to the Central Tribunal but were turned down by it as not being genuinely conscientious in their objection to military service.    As tho Central Tribunal passed evoryona whom they could find an excuse for passing, it is safe to assume that none of this group were genuinely conscientious and they should not be rfi-employed.(d) Men who refused to apply to the Pontral Tribunal, or having been passed by that Tribunal refused to accept wort under the Braoo Committee.    Those are the so-called &quot;absolutists&quot;. Some are men of the most genuinely conscientious typo who object not only to military service but to all btato oontrolj others are mon who were obsesaod with the idea that they wer4 entitledto full exemption under the i.ot and refused to take anything short of that: while others aro men whose grounds for claiming exemption were so bad that they did not oare to submit them even to an extremely loniont Tribunal.    The Home Office thought that the first type probably preponderated and were disposed to su&amp;goet that this sub-division, in spite of the fact that it contained some violent anarohists who had bohavod vory badly in prison, might be treated as on the whole genuinely conscientious.    The Treasury, however, is inclined to think that men who have absoluto objections to all forms.oi btato control aro not fit to be employed in the  , Civil Service and that though they may be genuinely Conscientious they should not be re-employed.The Treasury therefore proposes that only the mon v\ho satisfied tho Central Tribunal that they were genuinely oonscien-tious in their objection to military service and who worked satisfactorily under the Brace Committee should be ro-employed, on the terms proposed in the Treasury Memorandum,. G.T.7495, andthat
that the others should not &quot;be ro-employed.    The Home Offioe concurs in the Treasury view as regards all except Class (d) above and does not desire to press a   difforent view with regard to Class (d).It should be made clear that the Treasury proposal leaves it absolutely to the discretion of the Head of the Department in each case whother he should ro-employ any individual conscientious objector, and further that it leaves open the question of re-instatement to be considered at a later date%ftTreasury.I8th July. 1919.
