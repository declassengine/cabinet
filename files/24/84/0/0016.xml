a 1:ho Property of/MEMORANDUM BY &apos;THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER.REPARATION - SlilPI-TO LOSSES.WARCABINET.&quot; The Shipping Controller fully concurs in the PrimeMinisterfs suggestion that ex Committee be appointed to consider this question.(see G.T.7631).He is not however in full agreement with Lord SumnerU Memorandum, and for the purpose of any discussion of the subject by the War Cabinet   desires.to submit the following observations.(1) The material hitherto provided for the purposes of the British claim by the Ministry of Shipping was compiled at the request of the Treasury on general lines indicated by the Treasury.(2) It was understood, that the policy of the Treasury was to prepare the British claim on a reasonable and easily intelligible basis with the object of inducing our Allies to adopt the same basi3 for their shipping claims and of enabling us to check inflation in their claims.   It is just because the value of British ships was relatively so low that the value of say, Japanese ships was relatively so high,(3)   It appears that this policy has not been adopted, at any rate so far, and, while the Shipping Controller is not fully informed a3 to the policy of the British Delegates on the Reparation Commission, there are indications that Great &apos;&apos; Britain will be led into a competition in inflation with her Allies..(4) If this be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s   Government, well and good; but the Shipping Controller feels bound to point out that it involves a grave risk of serious financialprejudice /
prejudice to Great Britain.(5) Lord. Sumner appear3 not to appreciate the position of the Shipping Ministry in this matter.   There has never, 30 far as the Shipping Controller is concerned, been any question of securing cheap ships for British shipowners or of enabling the Shipping Ministry to get out of the transaction without loss, as Lord Bumner suggests. The point is merely this, that it is in the interests of France and Italy ( and in certain contingencies of the United States ) that the highest possible value should be put on the ships allocated to the several Allies in reparation;   it is to the interest of Great Britain (and in certain contingencies of the United States) that the lowest possible value should be put on these ships. It appears to the Shipping Controller, though he may possibly not be the best Judge of this matter, that If we admit and employ arguments in favour of putting a high value on the vessels lost our position in resisting, as against our Allies, the placing of a high value on the ships delivered by Germany will be gravely and perhaps fatally compromised. &apos;Cg.) If the facts ae to the working of the Reparation Pool and the form in which credit is to be given by -Great Britain to the Pool are not as the Shipping Controller supposes, the position may be different; but on this matter he can only be guided by the Treasury. And in a-?y case it appears to him of the f ivst importance that we should not be committed to a basis for the reparation claim until the basis of valuation of theEnemy/
Stoemy vessels has been agreed between the Allies.(7)   Subject to the above and to a decision as to the basis of valuation, the Shipping Controller would prepare if required a detailed valuation of all British ships lost during the war by Enemy action? he is also prepared to furnish figures of the cost of repairing damage to requisitioned ships and&apos;0overn-ment owned ships held to be due to Enemy action ( such figures would be approximate in 30 far as the repairs have not been completed).(8)   The cost of repairing war risk damage to other British vessels would have to be ascertained by the Board of Trade from the various War Risks Associations or other Underwriters of the risk, or from the owners.   It would also be for the Board of &apos;?rade, and in the case of Government cargoes the Departments owning the cargoes, to furnish figures as to losses of cargo and freight.(9)   Before the ships can be so valued, the following questions of principle must be decided by the authority to whom it falls to make a decision(a) at what date is the vessel to be valued;(b) on what basis is she to be valued - i.e,to what extent is the relative depreciation of British tonnage by reason of requisition and control to be ignored,(c )   to what extent is the consequential loss over and-above the value of the hull to be t avion into account - e      less of profits between the date of loss and the dabe of actual replacement;(d)   to what extent is the valuation to beaffected by the actual cost of building or acquiring those vesoels which were actually so built or acquired during the war in replacement of/
of losses; e.g, many standard ships were built at less than  20 a gross registered ton and a number of vessels were bought abroad at prices of  60 a gross registered ton and over;(e) are losses of tonnage, the value of which, was repaid by the Ally, and consequently did not fall on Great Britain, to be included in the claim for financial purposes, or are such losses to be taken into account only for tonnage purposes, i.e, for the ton for ton claim;(f) per contra, are losses of Allied and Neutral tonnage which were in fact paid for by Great Britain either (i) as charterers, or (ii) as insurers, to be&apos; excluded for financial purposes on the ground that the flag was foreign.(10)   In conclusion, the Shipping Controller while not desiring to discuss or traverse Lord Suirmor!s memorandum in detail, thinks it neoessary to point out that, after the question of the policy to be followed in this matter has been decided, there will still remain questions of principle to he settled before the valuationsdesired by Lord Sumner can be made, and that these questions arise just as much in valuing the ships individually as in valuing them in the lump at an average figure.   The only difference is that they arise many times instead of once.   Whatever method of calculation be followed, the basis of valuation must necessarily be arbitrarily chosen, and no amount of detail, expert opinion, and legal proof, however essential in point of form, can constitute a solution of the problem: at best they would serv^   to disguise it.(11)   It may be added that the average market value at the date of loss of 931 ships lost by Enemy action whilet requisitioned (of which all but 99 were lost since the great rise in values took place) is &amp;&amp;&amp;j%8B per gross registerton/
ton.   These ships include vessels of all classes not excluding valuable passenger liners and high cla cargo liners.   This figure covers nearly half the total British tonnage tor which reparation is claimed.16th July, 1919.
