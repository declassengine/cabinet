This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,SECRET.,WAR CABINET. 281VASify. -       THE MILITARY SITUATION IN RUSSIA., JIemorandum by the Secbetaey ob State bob Wab.I circulate to my colleagues the appreciation of the Russian situation which has been prepared by the General Staff. With this appreciation and with the policy recommended, I..am in full agreement. The events which have since taken place in - North Russia only emphasize the wisdom of the policy advocated and hasten its execution. The detail and the method had better be left to the military and naval authorities here and on the spot.If the recommendations of the General Staff are adopted as a whole, I would ask that they should be effectively and earnestly pursued by the Government within the limits approved. This will involve (a) using our utmost influence with the Americans and the Japanese to induce them to support&apos;the Siberian front and Koltchak&apos;s Government, while we concentrate our aid on Denikin; (6) fixing a definite sum of money which may be expended by the War Office during the next 8 months in whatever way they think best in aiding and equipping General Denikin, this sum to be additional to ordinary surplus stores ; and (c) in addition securing to General Denikin the certain limited credits necessary during the next six or eight months for reopening trade in his area.&apos;2. We shall then know exactly what our commitment is, and will not have to fight on each small point.which arises in carrying out within the prescribed limits the general policy which has been approved.4. Attention is also directed to my letter to the Prime Minister of 8th March last on which we have hitherto been acting, and also to the declaration of the four Great Powers in Paris contained in their reply of 3rd July to Admiral Koltchak&apos;s accept--ance of their terms, in which they state that they will continue their assistance in munitions, &amp;c.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.24th July, 1919. .Note by the Chief of the Imbebial Genebal Staff.Secretary of State,      -I forward herewith an attempt to visualize the Russian situation, the kaleidoscopic nature of which makes it almost impossible to focus.The gist of our recommendations is that we should close down our military effort on all fronts except South Russia, with the object of concentrating all available resources for the assistance, of Denikin.It is in that theatre that we can most easily apply our weight, and from there we are free to come and go as we will, thanks to our command of the salt water. It is there, too, that the anti-Bolshevik cause is most promising, and where our assistance, if given in full measure, may help to turn the scale.Since this paper was written we&apos; have received the grave news, from Ironside, of the wholesale mutiny on the Onega front. I need hardly point out how much this strengthens the argument against leaving any British officers or men at Archangel through the winter, which is now indeed out of the question.HENRY WILSON,C.I.G.S.23rd July, 1919.(b19/336)   50  7/19   h&amp;S  7841 wo

THE MILITARY SITUATION IN RUSSIA.July, 191-9.1. Difficulty of apprecxating unstable elements. Thd most striking feature of the Eussian situation since the commencement of the struggle against the Bolshevik military forces has been the extraordinary vicissitudes experienced by both sides, first on one front and then on another. The swings of the pendulum have been so abnormal that it has proved impossible to forecast with any accuracy either the local prospects on particular fronts, .or the general development of the situation as a whole. In attempting to appreciate the present position, therefore, it will be well to compare the conditions now obtaining, with the situation 12 months ago.2. The situation in July August, 1918. (a.) Northern Front. In July, 1918, the Northern front may be said to have been non-existent. It is true that a small Allied force was in possession of Murmansk and Pechenga and were guarding. these two ice-free ports from occupation by the Germans, and from being utilized as submarine bases. On the 7th July, 1918, the local authorities at Murmansk threw off allegiance to the Soviet Government at Moscow, and on the 1st August, 1918, the coup cVetat took place at Archangel, whereby the North Russian Provisional Government was established. This Government was naturally at that time entirely without troops or resources.(6.) Eastern Front. A year ago, on what is now the Eastern front, the Czecho-Slovaks, some 25,000 men strong, had reached the. culminating point of the offensive which they had carried out with the object of reaching Archangel and of realizing their desire to fight the Germans in the west. With the assistance of some 4,000 Russians of little fighting value, they had reached the line Ekaterinburg Kazan Penza  Samara, when they kept up a light touch with Uralsk and Orenburg, where the Cossacks of these two districts were defending themselves obstinately, under the leadership of Dutoff. Behind this front Siberia was still in the throes of the struggle against the local Bolsheviks and especially in the east where another body of Czechs, on their way to Vladivostock were endeavouring to join hands with Semenoff. Meanwhile, in this huge country, there was no Government, there were no organized troops and no order, while the Bolsheviks were endeavouring to arm the German and Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war, who numbered several hundred thousand, and to employ them to overwhelm their opponents.(c.) Southern Front. In the region on which the present Southern Front is based, the partially formed forces of General Alexeieff composed largely of ex-officers, were moving south with the object of clearing the Bolsheviks out of the Kuban and Norl-h Caucasus, and freeing an area which could form a. nucleus for a future reconstituted Russia. Ekaterinodar and Novo Rossisk were not occupied until the 15th and 28th August, 1918. General AlexeiefFs forces at the commencement of July, 1918, were but 9,500 strong with 20 guns, whilst the opponents who attempted to prevent their movements south totalled 70,000. In  he Don region the Don-Cossacks had a local Government hostile to the Bolsheviks with which the Volunteer. Army of Alexeieff maintained relations, but these relations were not close owing to the tendency of the Don Ataman to cultivate the Germans with a view to obtaining military supplies.id.) The Ukraine and Western Front. The whole of the Ukraine and the whole of Great and White Russia to the west of the general line Narva Pskoff Smolensk  Kursk Rostoff was in German hands, and the seeds were being sown \vhich made the country a suitable field for the Bolshevik advance of the winter 1918-1919.(7341) a 2
(e.) The Bolshevik Military Situation a year ago and its subsequent development.  It may be said that it was in the mouths of July and August, 1918, that the real, foundations of the present Bolshevik Army were laid, Until July, 1918, the Bolsheviks opposed the Czechs in the east, and Alexeieff in the south, with a heterogeneous collection of units and columns, whose strengths bore no proportion to the titles borne by them. Units were nob organized in higher formations and the troops were obtained-from voluntary enlistment, It was soon found, however, that such an organization, or rather lack of organization, would not suffice for serious operations, and therefore on the 4th July, 1918, at the &quot;5th All Russian Congress of Soviets,&quot; it was decided to introduce a fundamental system of military organization combined with universal liability for service. A tentative mobilization had indeed been carried out in June, but it was not until September that the formation of the first six Regular divisions, usually described either as Rifle or as Fusilier divisions, was commenced.At this period Trotzki definitely stopped the formation of any new units other than the new regular troops, and a decision was taken gradually to&apos; form the irregular units on the front and in&quot; the interior into regular divisions as opportunity occurred,Until July, 1918, it is doubtful whether the Soviet Government were able or willing to avail themselves of the services of the Russian ex-General Staff and Regimental Officers, who are now directing the Bolshevik operations and military organization. It is probable, however, that they were assisted to a large extent by Germans, The first definite decision to employ regular officers appears to have been taken, when it was decided to form the original six divisions. During the twelve months which have elapsed since then, the employment of ex-General Staff and other officers has become more and more general. Trotzki very soon found that they possessed technical knowledge which could not be acquired without the possession of brains and the advantages of education. By the threat of starvation and the holding of their families as hostages, more and more have been caught in the mesh, and many of the senior officers are so compromised that perforce they give their best work, as defeat of the Bolsheviks spells disaster for them.It is difficult to give an estimate of the total number of Bolshevik troops in July5i 1918, but at the beginning of September it was estimated that there were 37,000 Bolsheviks on the Eastern front opposing the Czechs, ^yliilsfc in the region which now forms the Southern front there were probably some 70,000. During this period on the Northern front there were only some 500 in the Archangel region, whilst other irregular troops were disposed opposite the German line between Narva and the Sea of Azov.During the twelve months which have elapsed since the decision of the &quot; 5th All Russian Congress of Soviets&quot; referred to above, it has been found possible, by creating . fresh formations and re-organizing old ones, to place in the field 40 regular rifle divisions besides a considerable number of local divisions raised in the Ukraine, the Don Country, Turkestan, &amp;c.The total numbers of troops in the field at various dates in 1919 is shown in the attached &quot; Table of Bolshevik Strengths in the Field, 1919.&quot;   (See Appendix B.).As regards the troops in the interior, it is difficult to form any estimate as to numbers, as it has become increasingly difficult to obtain detailed information from the interior of the country on such points. In January, 1918, it was estimated that the troops formed and forming in the interior numbered a little over 400,000. At the end of April, 1919, it was estimated that in the interior there were 727,000. Since April, extremely heavy fighting has taken place both on the Eastern and Southern fronts, and on parts of the Western front. Drafts have been drawn from the interior to replace casualties. Desertions have taken place in many sectors on a very large scale. Mobilizations of different classes have been proclaimed in different parts of Russia and new territory has been won and lost. It seems, therefore, impossible now, in default of further information, which is at present not to be obtained, to give a figure which can be looked upon as being in any sense reliable. There is no evidence of any large formation in the interior. The system, almost certainly, is to despatch the &quot; march companies,&quot; formed as a result of a new mobilization, straight to a front area, there to be formed into new divisions, or to be employed to complete those which have suffered casualties.The general conclusion to be arrived, at from a consideration of the population of, and conditions obtaining in, Soviet Russia, as also from a study of the figures in Appendix &quot;B&quot; &quot;Table of Bolshevik Strengths in the Field, 1919,&quot; seems to be that it will be possible for the Soviet Government at any rate to maintain an army of between 450,000-500,000 men in the field in spite of very heavy fighting and that in case of pressure being&apos; released, the figure of half a million may even be slightly exceeded.
3. The Present Military Situation, July, 1919. (a.) Northern Front. In the Murmansk area, General Maynard with some 7,000 Allied troops, aided by about 9,000 partially-formed local troops, is in occupation of the ice-free ports of Pechenga and Murmansk, and is guarding the long line of communications thence to the northern extremity of Lake Onega, where he holds a short and comparatively strong front, blocking the approach of the Bolsheviks to the above ports and to the summer ports on the shores of the White Sea. The Russian portion of his force is not strong either in numbers or moral, and whether it can stand alone is open to question.The Bolsheviks, who were recently estimated to number altogether some 5,800 in the area between Lakes Onega and Ladoga, but who are now being reinforced, have also to contend with irregular White Finn troops who made an incursion, which for . a time gave them possession of Olonetz and nearly brought them to Petrozavodsk. These Finns, however, are now withdrawing and will in all probability shortly cease to be a factor in the situation.In the Archangel area some 13,000 British troops and 22,500 (partially formed) Russians are opposed to the Bolshevik 6th Army of some 33,500. Here, as at Murmansk, the object aimed at has for some time been to organize the Russian military forces and civil administration, so as to enable them to hold their own and to allow of the withdrawal of the British troops. Operations are now in progress with a view to presenting the Russians with a situation on the front which will facilitate their keeping the Bolsheviks off during the dangerous period which will follow the withdrawal of the British troops.The two new British brigades now at General Ironside&apos;s disposal are composed of first-rate troops, but the moral of the Russians is such an uncertain factor that the process of withdrawal from Archangel will be a delicate operation, while the military and political situation in this area subsequent to our withdrawal will be problematical.Before the recent collapse of Kolchak&apos;s front, while his right wing was about Glazov, nearly 150 miles west of Perm and only 100 miles east of Viatka, there was good reason to hope that he might make an effective junction with the forces from Archangel. In that case there would have been a fair certainty of the Archangel Government and their forces maintaining themselves after the withdrawal of the Allied troops. Now, however, that there is no chance of Kolchak joining hands with Ironside before the winter, there are,-grave doubts as to whether the Russian Northern forces will prove sufficiently staunch to stabilize the political situation, and we have to face the possibility, if not the probability, of the whole anti-Bolshevik organization in this area falling. to pieces. In these circumstances it is a matter for very careful consideration whether we should be justified in having a military mission, as previously contemplated, at Archangel throughout the winter, cut off as they will be from all outside assistance and entirely dependent on the fighting efficiency and loyalty of the Russian troops. - If it could be confidently asserted that the presence of 2,000 British, officers and men (supposing it to be possible to raise that number of volunteers) would make all the difference to the stability of the North Russian forces or otherwise, it might be worth while to take the risk. But have we any grounds for believing this to be the case ? The recent mutiny, reported by General Ironside, which cost the lives of several British officers, took place in his best disciplined and most promising Russian unit, at a time when local conditions were highly favourable and when strong British forces were on the spot. This deplorable occurrence raises inevitable misgivings as to what is likely to happen in the winter when the military situation on the front will be critical, conditions of existence almost unbearable, and there are no British bayonets to hold in check the forces of demoralization and treachery. In view of these considerations the General Staff are reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the risks involved in leaving a military mission at Archangel after the withdrawal of the British forces is not one which they can advise His Majesty&apos;s Government to take.On the other hand, it is essential that the supply of food for the Russian troops and civil population should be guaranteed throughout the winter, for which ^purpose it must be landed at Archangel before the port closes.   Unless this is done there will be no chance of the Archangel Government maintaining itself.[b.) Eastern Front. After a spectacular advance which all but reached the high-water mark attained by the Czechs in 1918, Admiral Kolchak has suffered a reverse of even greater magnitude. The Bolsheviks, whose strength on this front is about 130,000 after recapturing Perm, Krasnoufimsk, Sarapul, Birsk and Ufa, have now gained the line of the Urals, including Ekaterinburg, and the way to Siberia lies open to them. On the southern portion of the front they are endeavouring to re-bpen their
communications with Turkestan vid the Orenburg Tashkent railway in order to re-plenish their supplies of cotton and facilitate their anti-British schemes in Afghanistan and India. Admiral Kolchak&apos;s forces appear to be retiring at present without making any effective resistance, although the staff still talk of counter-offensives to be under-taken in the near future. It is certain that the moral of the Bolshevik forces is slightly, if at all, superior to that of the Siberians and it is reasonable to suppose that the same causes which led to Kolchak&apos;s retreat will in turn begin to operate against the Bolsheviks, while in view of the situation on other fronts it is improbable that the latter will be able to bring about a decision. They have, indeed, already been forced to detach troops from their 5th Army operating on this front to oppose Denekin&apos;s advance, and troops have also been hurried westwards to secure Petrograd from capture.As far as can be estimated from the very confused and constantly changing situation, Admiral Kolchak has some 120,000 troops, all Russian, on the Eastern front as compared with 4,000 twelve months ago, besides a further 100,000 forming or garrisoned in Siberia. His reverses at the front have been accompanied by a recrudescence of Bolshevik activities in the interior, but so far .these have been successfully kept under control. The Siberian Railway, on which the whole position largely depends, has now, thanks to the Allied assistance, begun to operate with some regularity. The situation, however, depends on the presence of Allied bayonets, and complete chaos would certainly supervene were they withdrawn. In this connection a problem which calls for immediate solution is the repatriation of the Czecho-Slovak troops. Various proposals nave been put forward for these forces to cut their way through either to Archangel or to the Volga, but these have had to be abandoned because it is now certain that nothing will induce these troops to return to the front or to do any more fighting for the Russians. At the present moment they number about 50,000, and are echeloned between Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk fulfilling the important r61e of protecting the railway. When they are withdrawn this duty will have to be taken over either by the Americans or Japanese, or both Powers in combination. In view of the leading part taken by Mr. Stevens, the American engineer controlling-the Siberian Railway, it is possible that the United States may consider it an American interest to provide troops for the purpose. There are also indications that America is contemplating more active intervention in Siberia.Of the two British battalions sent to Siberia, the 25th Bn. Middlesex Regiment is now at Vladivostock and the 9th Bn. Hampshire Regiment has reached Omsk having been ordered back from. Ekaterinburg just in time to escape being involved in the debacle. In spite of the obvious drawbacks of such procedure it is considered that this battalion should straightway continue its journey to Vladivostock and that both it and the 25th Bn. Middlesex Regiment should embark for home as soon as transportation and shipping facilities will permit.The British effort in this theatre, in addition to the despatch of the two infantry battalions, has taken the form of (a.) Supplying arms, ammunition, clothing and equipment for 200,000 men, anda further amount now en route for upkeep. (6.) Provision of a mission consisting of 230 officers and 280 other ranks for &quot; training, railway and administrative purposes.With this materiel and personnel General Knox has equipped six Russian divisions and produced excellent results in the training schools at Russian Island and at Tomsk, which have between them turned out more than 650 officers and 850 non-commissioned officers. A further number of 400 officers are now in process of training. It is only by means of the material provided that General Knox has been able to induce the Russian military authorities to follow his advice to some extent in the matter of training and organization. Without such solid inducements neither he nor any other British officer would be able to insist on sound methods. This fact must be borne in mind in considering the future of the British Mission now that the supply of surplus matenel is running out.Unfortunately, even General Knox&apos;s forcible personality and knowledge of the. Prussians, with whom he is persona grata, backed by the British matenel, have been unable to ensure that this equipment has been turned to the best account. The incompetence of the &quot;Russian Staff and regimental officers, which is only equalled by their vanity and impatience of any foreign advice, has resulted in squandering both men and material in premature and ill-considered enterprises, so that practically nothing now remains for future use. General Janin, the French officer who arrogated to himself responsibility for advising Kolchak as to military operations, has proved to be a mere
-cipher without the slightest influence on the situation. No additional materiel sent by us could in any case influence this year&apos;s campaign, nor have we any grounds for believing that it would be more profitably expended in the future than in the past, for the Russian Staff appear to have learned nothing and to have forgotten nothing. In view of this experience and of the fact that we are now rapidly approaching the end of&apos; the equipment that is surplus to our own requirements, it is not considered that it would be wise to expend further efforts in this direction either in the supply of equipment or in the attempt to train Russian personnel. It is therefore recommended that on the withdrawal of the two British battalions, General Knox&apos;s Mission should be re-organized on the following lines : Sufficient personnel should be retained in Siberia to carry out the duties specified below.(a.) To secure adequate representation at Kolchak&apos;s Headquarters and at other places where it is desirable to keep representatives. (b.) To obtain information.(c.) To ensure the reception, guarding and distribution of any military stores whichmay still be on the way. (d.) To ensure continuance of our representation and assistance as regards therailway.(c.j Southern Front. The startling successes of General Denekin in South Russia now constitute a formidable menace to the Bolsheviks and indeed threaten the lines of communication which feed the southern portion of their forces on the Eastern Front. Balashoff, now in the hands of the Volunteer Army, is but 50 miles from the Tamboff  Saratov Railway and 130 miles from the Penza Samara Railway. Denekin&apos;s Northern Front is now more than twice as near Moscow as the Bolshevik front on the Urals, and were the latter to meet any real resistance from Kolchak their position might easily become critical. The Uralsk Cossacks operating just south of Nikolaievsk are but 100 miles south-west of Saratov. In addition, the position of Astrakhan, which form their main link with, and base of attack on, the oil districts of the Caucasus, is precarious. Tzaritzin, Kharkoff and the Crimea have been freed by the Volunteer Army, and Voronezh, Kursk, Poltava, and Nikolaiev are threatened by them. Perhaps the heaviest blow sustained by the Bolsheviks as a result of these operations has been the loss of the Donetz - Coal Basin from which the greater portion of the coal supply of Russia is drawn. This loss, combined with the dislocation caused in the corn-producing portions of the Ukraine by the activities of GrigoriefFs bands, would, if confirmed, have such a damaging effect on the Bolshevik cause that they must detach largely from other fronts, in order to recover the use of these two areas. The forces engaged on the Southern Front itself are estimated at present to be 100,000 Bolshevik troops against 150,000 of the Volunteer Army, but in view of their central position the Bolsheviks can certainly concentrate superior forces in course of time.The rate of Denekins advance has latterly slowed down. He has announced his intention of making good the line Saratov Tamboff Voronezh Kursk with the subsequent idea of continuing the.advance on Moscow. It. is very doubtful, however, whether he will be able to carry out even the first part of his programme and there is no certainty that the same causes which conduced to Kolchak&apos;s retrograde movement may not produce similar results with Denekin. Unless he can offer to the wretched inhabitants of the liberated districts, which now number some 60,000,000 souls, conditions of existence better than those which they suffered under the Bolshevik regime, he will in the course of time be faced with revolt and hostility in his rear just at the time when the Bolsheviks will be concentrating large numbers of troops for a counter-offensive on his front. Unless Denekin can&apos; restore and maintain the railways he can neither manoeuvre nor subsist his troops. In order to do this he must obtain Allied assistance in the shape of credit and commodities. A proposal is now before the Cabinet for a loan of 2,000,000^. to be granted to Denekin to enable him to purchase food as well as essential commodities which he can barter with the peasants for their corn.A detailed report by General Briggs giving Denekin&apos;s most pressing requirements is added in Appendix A.Unless this assistance is forthcoming in time it will be optimistic to consider that Denekin can successfully maintain his present gains and the stability of his front is dependent even more on the economic consolidation ^ of the area behind it than on the purely military measures of defence in the front line. &quot;The situation may be said to be at present hanging in the balance.   If Denekin is enabled to continue his advance it
must bring about the wholesale retirement of the Bolsheviks from the Urals,   From-, the, military point of view, therefore, this is the area in which any British assistance which can be given will be most profitably applied, and the General Staff would urge -that if it be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to support the anti-Bolshevik forces in their struggle to establish a free democratic Government in Russia, they&quot; should extend all possible assistance in military personnel, equipment, financial credit,, and trading facilities to General Denekin. .The date fixed for the commencement of our withdrawal from the Caucasus is the 15th August and it is considered that no further postponement should be made, It will accordingly be necessary for the Caspian fleet to be handed over to Denekin by that date as it is now clear that the Italians have no intention of taking over the responsibility. .    -(d.) Western Front. On this front, from the Gulf of Finland to the mouth of the Dniester, the position is on the whole stationary, although after a period, during which the Russian North-Western Army succeeded in pressing the northern wing of the Soviet 7th Army back almost on to Gatchina, a Bolshevik counter-offensive is in progress which is having some success. It is hoped, however, that military supplies and tanks from Great Britain will arrive in time to prevent a collapse and possibly to enable the Russians even to attempt an advance on Petrograd. Petrograd is a prize on which not only the Russians, but also the Finns, cast longing eyes and General Mannerheim might attempt its capture, if he could obtain the prne he demands, which may be summarized as follows : A loan of 15,000,000^. and a grant of military supplies from the Allies : from the Russians, territorial concessions in the Kola Peninsula and in Karelia. There are, however, indications that the Germans intend to play a prominent r61e on this Front, on one side or the other.(e.) Hungary and Austria. The Bolshevik movement which originated in Buda-Pest has continued to grow in strength and at the present time Bela Kun has a force which may amount to 200,000 men well equipped and undeniably superior in fighting quality to any of the forces opposing them. On a small scale the strategic situation in Hungar)^ corresponds to that of the Central Powers during the war and of the Bolsheviks at the present time, i.e., they have all the strategic advantages of interior lines coupled with the economic disadvantage of a, partial blockade, but in this case the capital of Hungary is so near the present Roumanian and. Czech Fronts that the Hungarian position is a weak one. The fact that Allied policy is against offensive operations enables Bela Kun to strike in any direction and there are indications that he is preparing an offensive in the direction of Pressburg and Brun. If this movement succeeds, as he apparently hopes, in drawing in the Austrians, the united forces of the two countries would have no difficulty in over-running Czecho-Slovakia. What the German attitude would be in these circumstances is uncertain, but it would appear to be in her interests that the Czechs should be weakened to assist their ultimate absorption by Germany.4. Future prospects of the anti-Bolshevik campaign. It has been pointed out that strategically, in theory at least, the advantages rest with the Bolsheviks, who, acting on interior lines are able to concentrate at will against each of the widely separated anti-Bolshevik forces. Transportation and economic considerations are, however, gradually reducing this advantage. Rolling stock is steadily deteriorating, ammunition is running short, production of all necessities is diminishing, local insurrections are becoming more frequent, in fact all the various factors which led to the collapse of the Central Powers are operating in favour of the anti-Bolshevik forces. Thus, unless this condition alters, there can eventually be but one end, the complete breakdown of the whole Bolshevik machine from economic rather than military causes. In the meantime, the immediate military necessities from the Bolshevik point of view, would appear to be :  . ,(a.) To hold Petrograd until such time as the freezing of the Baltic diminishes the danger.(6.) To stop Denekin&apos;s advance and to recover the coal-fields of European Russia which he now holds.(c.) To open up the Orenburg Tashkent Railway in order to procure cotton from Turkestan, to foment trouble in Afghanistan and Persia, and so to neutralise the power of the British Empire to intervene against the Soviet Government.(d.) To effect a junction with the Magyar forces and so break through the cordon-sanitaire which is now established on the Western Front.
The prospects of Bolshevik success in each case appear to be as follows : (a.) In view of the delay and uncertainty of Finnish intervention, the obstructive attitude of the Germans, and the absence of any definite and strong action on the part of the Allies, their prospects of holding Petrograd seem good.(b.) Being on interior lines, provided they command sufficient transportation, they would have no difficulty in concentrating superior forces against Denekin, though this will probably lead to the cessation of their advance and a .  possible retirement on the Eastern Front.(c.) The opening of the Tashkent Orenburg line appears to be well within their power, once Denekin has been stopped.(d.) It appears unlikely that they can afford troops to break through to Hungary, but the converse is not so uncertain, particularly if Hungary is assisted by Germany or Austria.The general situation from the Allied point of view is, therefore, that on one Front and one Front only are military prospects at all encouraging.If, however, success is achieved in this, the main theatre, success in the others may , follow. All past experience has shown that the problem is as much economic as military, for unless Denekin can improve the lot of the inhabitants in the reoccupied areas, his force in its turn will be dissipated in policing a discontented population and its power for offence will disappear.5. Gonclusions.-To sum up, it may be said that the military situation as a whole is now trembling in the balance, its future development depending chiefly on what Denekin is able to accomplish in South Eussia. It is considered, therefore, that for the remainder of this year&apos;s campaign the British military effort should be concentrated in affording Denekin the maximum assistance in men, money and material, even at the expense of all other Fronts. Taking the long view, it is unquestionable that what the British Empire has most reason to fear in the future is a Russo-German combination, which, starting as a commercial and economic organization, will ultimately develop into a military alliance. We have at the present time a great opportunity of establishing on a permanent footing British influence and British trade connections in South Russia, where British prestige is high and where the Russians are deeply sensible of the practical assistance they have already received from us. If we take advantage of this opportunity it may well prove to provide a permanent counterpoise to German penetration and be of vast advantage to us, both from the military, political and economic point of view. Nor should it be forgotten that the rich districts of the Don and the Donetz have a peculiar significance for the British people, situated as they are on one of the principal avenues of approach to our Eastern Empire. It is thus just as important, in regard to the distant future as to the immediate military situation, that every possible effort should be devoted to South Russia.It may be that even with all the assistance that we can afford him General Denekin may not be able to achieve decisive results before the winter, in which case it appears probable that a period of exhaustion on both sides may supervene. It is in any case almost certain that great masses of the Russian people will be faced with starvation in the course of the winter, the results of which it is impossible to calculate.After this summers campaign it will be necessary once more to review the situation and to decide on our policy for 1920. But it may be said with some confidence that the choice will have to be made between doing a great deal more than we have done in the past or terminating all military effort in Russia, which will then have to work out her own salvation with such assistance as can be provided by the ordinary channels of trade and commerce.6.

APPENDICES.APPENDIX A.EE PORT BY LIEUT.-GENEIUL SIR CHARLES BRIGGS, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., ON THE PRINCIPAL REQUIREMENTS OF GENERAL DENE1CIN&apos;S FORCESIf it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to back Denekin in his fight against Bolshevism, it is imperative that the following support and assistance be given to him at once, in addition to the supply of arms, clothing and equipment for 250,000 men, or else, in my opinion, he will lose the ground already won, and further progress in his inarch ou Moscow will cease. His troops will commence retiring, and the whole country under his regime will relapse to Bolshevism. .The headings given below are the most urgent :-(i.) Money.-A credit in England of 2,000,000/.    The supply of seven thousand miliard roubles,paper money, (ii.) Gram.-\,000,000,000 poods of grain.(iii.) Clothing, arms, and equipment including guns for an additional army of 250,000 men.  -(iv.) The recognition of Kolehalis Government, and or the Embassy in London.No recognition of small States until the question of Russia as a whole has been ( onsideredat a Conference of the Allies and Russian Government, (v.) The return of the volunteer fleet to Denekin. More consideration in the lines of demarcation laiddown periodically, (vi.) Commercial facilities. (vii.) Arms and munitions from Roumania.In regard to (i.), it is essential that Denekin has a credit in England in order to defray his minor debts, and also to purchase commodities to exchange for wheat in the Kuban. The Kuban farmers will not accept roubles in payment, for their 6orn, but will only exchange the latter for clothing and the necessities of life. The corn of the Kuban is urgently requiied to feed the starving people in the conquered countries as well as the Black Sea Provinces and Terek and Daghestan.With reference to (ii.). Denekin has no source of revenue except gifts of money by friends and admirers and from the roubles printed by the Don Press. (The Don Press will soon cease to exist through shortage of paper and dyes.) He has no money to pay for transit of war material on the railways, and as the railways are doing practically nothing but military work-they have no revenue. Denekin owed the railways four milliards of roubles on 1st May last, but had no money to pay. The railway companies are in urgent need of payment to satisfy the wages of their personnel. Denekin requisitioned the whole of the grain of the Stavropol Government last year, giving 1.0.U.&apos;s, and he is in urgent need of roubles to pay this debt, in order that they can buy commodities.I recommend, now that Denekin has joined with Kolchak, that he should be supplied forthwith with the same rouble as obtains in Kolehak&apos;s area. This matter is so urgent that I got the Embassy yesterday to forward the attached telegram (Appendix &quot; I &quot;)1 I consider that this telegram should be backed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.It will be essential that when Denekin exchanges commodities for corn in the Kuban he must have roubles to purchase exports to keep up his credit in England.It would appear futile for Denekin to apply for grain when South Russia is a grain growing country. It is therefore necessary, in order to grasp the situation, to read the report attached (Appendix &quot; II&quot;).If Denekin is given a credit, I think he will be able to get his urgent demands for grain met with for the present, but as starvation means Bolshevism, it is very necessary that this subject should be taken into full consideration. As an instance, in the Donetz Basin three months ago. all the labourers were Bolsheviks, but when given half rations they at once became loyal subjects. If, in the recently conquered area, the people are not supplied with flour, they will undoubtedly be won back by the Bolsheviks, as they will say the new regime is no better than the old, The demand made by Denekin, for one hundred million poods of grain, is probably a little in excess, but it is imperative that the need for flour be kept constantly in view.With regard, to (iii.). As Denekin&apos;s front is increasing daily, and with a huge population of something ike 60,000,000 coining under his care, it is absolutely necessary that he increases the strength of his army. The need, therefore, for arms, equipment and clothing, especially great-coats, jerkins, rifles and ammunition, as well as guns, is imperative.With regard to (iv.). The greatest recognition possible of Kolchak&apos;s Government is very essential to keep the small Stales from Separatist tendencies. At present General Denekin is handicapped in his advance by the demands of small States for increased territory, knowing full well that their own troops are taking part in the general advance. Through their agents in Paris they are gaining the impression that the Allies support Separatist tendencies. Had it not been for the hopes raised by the representatives of the small States in Paris, Denekin\s task would have been much lighter.The recognition, as far as possible, of the Embassy in London, would in my opinion strengthen Denekiu and Kolchak, and would prevent wasters and unimportant people from having access to members of the Government and the War Office.With reference to (v.). It is very essential for commerce and export trade in the Black Sea, that Denekin should have under his control the ships seized by the Allies. At present he is in the position of a beggar, asking the Allies for ships to convey his produce or munitions of war.With regard to (vi.)! The whole of the country over which Deuekin presides is whole-hearted English, the English name being the only one that carries any weight. The Russians are most anxious that the trade of this vast and rich area should not fall into the hands of the Germans, Americans, Greek or the French, and appeals are being made to me to do my utmost to further the opening of trade with England by the exchange of commodities. This vast area is capable alone of paying the whole of the Russian debts to the Allies, and it would be a thousand pities if the Germans, who has numerous agents in the country, were to gain supremacy of trade for which they are striving.(7341)c
With regard to (vii.). General Denekin complained most bitterly that the French in Odessa had seized arms, equipment, &amp;c, for at least two armies, as also had the Roumanians, and the English had allowed Georgia? Armenia and Ajebaijan to retain the whole of the arms and equipment for the Caucasian Army, thus placing him in the position of calling upon them for these necessities. He asked me to use every endeavour to obtain for him what belongs to Russia, in Roumania and the Caucasus. He pointed out that it is hard that be should have to buy from England when these essentials could be obtained from Roumania and the Caucasus free of charge.With reference to the resuscitation of the Russian fleet. Deuekin feels very acutely not being trusted to form a navy. He objects very strongly to the Caspian fleet being handed over to the Italians, because if they command the. Caspian fleet, he might be prevented from supplying or communicating with Trans-Caucasia, where he has a force, and the Ural Cossacks which are under his command. As the English gave only ten days&apos; notice to quit the Caspian, he feels that a change of Government or a change of policy might place him in the same position in the Black Sea. He urgently requests that he be permitted to gradually form a Black Sea fleet, eommencing with gunboats. As these craft will be manned by selected and guaranteed officers and personnel, the question of their becoming Bolsheviks does not arise. If the British Navy would take this in hand, it would increase our prestige, and would have a lasting effect in bringing the two navies into &quot;close comradeship. A special memorandum upon this subject will be forwarded as soon as it has been translated. - *Appendix &quot;7.&quot;Ambassade de Russie&apos; - -v:    a. .    ;Londres, No. 773.10th July, 1919.My dear General,I enclose herewith the translation of a telegram which I am sending to Admiral Kolchak. I am also communicating the text of this telegram to Paris, suggesting that a similar communication be made after consultation with General Dragomiroff, who is undoubtedly aware of the seriousness of this matter.I take this opportunity of expressing to you my warmest thanks for suggesting immediate action, and I sincerely hope that you will render me valuable assistance in causing Admiral Kolchak to understand the situation with the least possible delay.Yours very sincerely,(Signed) C. NABOKOFF.Lt.-General C. G. Briggs,The Cavalry Club,Piccadilly.&quot;Copy of a telegram from Monsieur Nabolcoff to the Russian Government at Omsk, dated 10th July, 1919.Please convey the following to Admiral Kolchak: The British General Briggs who has returned to London from Ekaterinodar, informs me that the printing at Rostoff of paper money is coming to an end owing to the lack of paper, colours and machinery, which cannot be supplied at once. The absence of currency notes deprives the Volunteer Army of the possibility of making payments to the population. Meanwhile, the needs of the Army have increased owing to vast regions being occupied. The situation is critical and the campaign may come to a standstill which would - undoubtedly very strongly affect the morale of the Army. General Briggs insists upon the necessity of supplying to the Volunteer Army the notes which have been printed in the United States to the amount of 575,000,000 roubles, and that further supplies of these roubles should be forthcoming. It is particularly advisable that all Russian currency notes should be circulated by the Volunteer Army in view of the recognition by General Denekin of the All-Russia Government under Admiral Kolchak. I understand from Sahmen that the Ministry of Finance at Omsk has already refused to deliver these banknotes as they are destined for the AU-Russian Exchange, and has suggested sending banknotes from Omsk. I earnestly hope that owing to the acute needs of which General Briggs has informed me, and owing to the impossibility of speedy delivery of notes from Omsk, the Ministry of Finance will recognize the necessity of revising their decision, and will give immediate instructions to the Russian Charge.d&apos;Affaires at Washington in the desired sense. The principle of reforming the system of currency on a right basis must, in my opinion, be set aside in order to satisfy the vital needs of the Volunteer Army. I have the definite impression that General Briggs, who is helping Russia whole-heartedly and energetically, attributes paramount importance to the Russian Government^ compliance with this earnest request of the Financial Advisers of General Denekin. General Briggs is convinced that a refusal may have disastrous results.[Copy.] &apos; Appendix &quot;II.&quot;REPORT CONCERNING THE NECESSITY OF EXPORTING 100 MILLION POODS OF GRAINFEOM AMERICA INTO RUSSIA.1. When the Volunteer Army will.advance north,in the direction of Moscow and Kiev, it will enter a province consisting of 20 governments, with an approximate population of 60 million. Although under normal conditions this province was not only able to feed itself, but had enough surplus grain for foreign export, constant civil war and socialization of land by the Bolsheviks have reduced these governments to a state when there can be no question of export,.as they cannot grow sufficient grain for their own consumption.
2. Basing ourselves on estimates (see enclosure), the command of the Volunteer Army will have to undertake the feeding of 21-5 million people. Allowing&apos; 20 pounds of grain a month for each person, and taking into consideration th6 fact that 10 months at least will elapse before normal-conditions are re-established, it appears that 108 million poods of grain will be required to feod the population.3. The Kuban Province and the Stavropol Government are so far the only grain-producing districts held by the Volunteer Army, and these, owing to reasons stated in enclosure, cannot produce more than 10-15 million poods of grain for the requirements of other Russian provinces4. From the above it will be seen that for the purpose of establishing order and providing for the population, a minimum of 100 million poods of grain must be imported from abroad. The above estimate is not in the least exaggerated, as it has been based on the fact that the Morthern and Central industrial provinces will be supplied with Siberian grain.It is very likely that owing to the limited transport capacity of the Siberian main line, which is over-burdened by military transports, the Northern and Central Industrial Governments will likewise have to be provided with grain from the Southern ports, and consequently the above-named 100 million poods will have to be distributed among a still greater number of famine-stricken governments.Director of Food Supplies of the Special Conference to General Headquarters of forces in South Russia.(Signed) S. MASLOV.Tkkaterinodar,8/21 April, 1919. Certified true copy:Director of Section of the General Administrative Department of Food Supplies.(Signed) I. KUTUZOV.[Copy.]Enclosure to Memorandum.Be export of grain from America.1. During the advance of the armies in the direction of Moscow and Kiev the Government of the Volunteer Army will be confronted with the colossal task of feeding the inhabitants who have been ruined by the Bolsheviks. Even presuming that the whole of the north, the north-west, the north-east and the central industrial district, consisting of the Archangel, Vitebsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Viatka, Kazan, Kaluga, Kostroma, Minsk, Mogilev, Moscow, Nijni-Novgorod, Novgorod, Olonets, Penza, Petrograd, Perm, Pskov, Ryuzan, Smolensk, Sumbirsk, Iver, Tula, Ufa and Yaroslav Governments, with an approximate population of sixty millions, will receive grain from Siberia, the Volunteer Army will still have to provide for an enormous province consisting of about twenty governments (not including the Steppe region, Turkestan, the Trans-Caucasus and the Baltic provinces), which also have an approximate population of sixty millions.2. Among those governments which will have to be supplied with grain from the Southern provinces are some that have always been regarded as non-producing,. such as the Terek - Dagestan region, the governments of the Black Sea, Orel and Astrakhan; some governments were and will probably continue to be grain-producing, even under the most adverse conditions, as for instance the Samara, Saratov, Orenburg, Tambov, Poltava, Podolsk and Volin Governments; on the other hand there are some governments which formerly produced grain, but owing to unfavourable circumstances might have become consuming govern-ments and require an import of grain, as for instance the Kursk, Voronej, Kherson, Taurida, Yekaterinoslav, Kiev, Kharkov and Chernigov Governments and the Don Province.3. It will be seen from the above that the estimate for the required amount of grain necessary for feeding the population of the above-named governments, must be drawn up in accordance with the following considerations: in governments which are distinctly consuming and not grain producing, the entire population should be included in the estimate as requiring imported grain; governments which are grain producing should be entirely excluded from the list of governments in need of imported grain ; finally, in those governments which have changed their nature owing to circumstances, only part of the population should be considered. In drawing up the estimate for the amount of gr-ain required by the above-named governments! it is reckoned that about half the population (in the Don Province five-sixths) is in need of imported grain. At this rate, the number of inhabitants which the Volunteer Army will have to feed in all the above-named governments, amounts to about 21^ million (Orlov Government-2,400,000; Astrakhan  1,300,000; Terek Province-1,317,000 ; Black Sea Governments-160,000; Kursk-1,415.000 ; Voronej-1,590,000; Kherson-1,650,000 ; Taurida-950,000 ; Yekaterinoslav-1,750,000; Don Province-3,000,000 ; Kiev-2,100,000; Kharkov-1,600,000 ; Chernigov-1,275,000).    .4. Allowing 20 pounds of grain a month per person, the total monthly consumption amounts to 10*75 million poods of grain. Taking 10 months as the period during which the population will have to be fed until a more or less stable economic life has been established, the bare requirements of South Russia in imported grain may be estimated at 108 million poods.5. The Kuban Province and the Stavropol Government, which are at present the only grain producing districts at the disposal of the Volunteer Army, are naturally unable to provide the above amount, particularly if the following facts are taken into consideration: (1) owing to the mobilization of men and horses great tracts of land will remain uncultivated; (2) owing to the absence of goods it will be extremely difficult to induce the owners to part with their grain.Ten to 15 million poods of grain is the maximum which is likely to be received from the provinces, thus 100 million poods must still be obtained.6. This shortage may seem absolutely incredible, as in pre-war days not only those governments which -have been specified above as distinctly grain producing, but even those which, owing to circumstances, have
changed from producing to consuming districts, together exporting several hundred million poods of grain a year. The following circumstances, hownver, must be taken into consideration, as they undoubtedly led to the impoverishment of these governments : (1.) Civil war, which devastated the fields.(5J.) Peasants&apos; rebellions, which hindered the cultivation of land and caused the inhabitants to flee afterthe rising had been suppressed. (3.) The agrarian revolution, which reduced the area of land habitually cultivated by the middlepeasantry.(4.) Mobilization for the Ukrainian and Red Armies.(5.) The fact of the Bolsheviks draining the few grain producing governments of their grain for feeding almost rhe entire population of the Northern, North-Western and Central Governments, as was the case in Kursk, Tambov, Voronej, Saratov and other governments.The recent events which took place in the Ukraine during the ploughing and sowing season will, of course, lead to a great decrease in the area of land under cultivation. The fact should also be borne in mind that the Bolsheviks will take almost all the grain reserves from the Ukranian Governments in order to feed their famine-stricken governments which, prior to the occupation of the Ukraine, were supplied with grain from the Tula, Kursk, Voronej, Tambov, Penza, Saratov and the remaining few grain producing governments, which until now were in the possession of the Bolsheviks.7. Even should the amount estimated at 100 million poods necessary for feeding all the Southern Governments be exaggerated, it should be borne in mind that probably Siberia, owing to the insufficient transport capacity of her main line, will be unable to feed all the governments allotted to her. In all probability grain will also have to be sent from the South to the Central Industrial Governments, which are starving in the full sense of the word.8. The above considerations lead to the conclusion stated, that Russia at present is in need of an import of approximately 100 million poods of grain.The success of the struggle against the the Bolsheviks depends on the possession of this store of grain. The new Russia, directly civil order and economic life have been re-established, will soon find means of repaying the cost of the 100 million poods of grain lent her in the days of her sore trial.Certified true copy.Director of the Section of the General idmiuistrative Food Supplies Department.(Signed)       I.
