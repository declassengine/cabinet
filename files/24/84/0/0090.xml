The private meeting of the Triple Allianoe yesterday, whioh mi^it have voted for direct aotion in all the Unions concerned, aotually referred the question of striking to a ballot, and experience has shown that very few strikes take place as a result of even a ballot favourable to the strike.   Ifp to last Sunday, the fight was industrial, but it is now taking on a definitely political, oharaoter.The temper of dlsoharged soldiers 1b bad, and this is having a disturbing effeot on labour all over the oountry. The pension, housing and employment questions are the main oauses of the discontent, and If these oould be even partially met the % situation would greatly improve.The riots at Luton, Coventry, Bilston, Swindon and fareham during the Peace Celebrations are an indication of the inflammable state of publio opinion.   It has re-acted upon the troops to the: extent of causing old inter-regimental feuds to break out into affrays in the Aldershot Command.The opposition to the peaoe Celebrations was less serious than might have been expected.The International General Strike against intervention in Russia, which was fixed for July 21st, did not take place in any of the three countries in whioh lit was planned.The general unrest seems not so muoh to be a revolutionary spirit as a definite feeling of irritation on the subjeot of hi^i prices, shortage of houses and alleged profiteering, but it may easily change for the worse.   The crying need for the moment appears to be eduoation in elementary eoonomios, for the judgment of the British working man may always be trusted when he really knows the foots.
the police,     wy correspondent reports that the Police in the ,.  Manchester and Liverpool area are well satisfied with the . new scales of pay.  They are less well-disposed towards the Polioe Federation, as most of the Sergeants and Constables are.members(of;the Polioe Union,    Their ohief objeotion. to the Federation appears to be that undue influence may be brought to bear by the higher ranks on questions brought up for disoussion by the lower ranics.The. steadier men in London appear to welcome the penal clauses because they will give them an excuse for refusing to obey any oall to strike.,:     Mr. Lwsbury advises that if&apos; the Polioe Bill is passed Labour should &quot;Down Tools&quot;, for he says, &quot;If the mines or the railways are nationalised the same sort of pressure oan be applied.to the workers in these industries.&quot;.The, &quot;Daily Herald&quot; looks upon the Poiioe Bill as a Government effort to secure a safe weapon in its war upon - organized Labour. ^ ;&apos;v --,i&apos;  In yesterdayU &quot;Daily Herald&quot; it is stated that the Exeoutive Committee have deoided to fight against the terms of the Polioe Bill by every means in its power, as it is , in direot opposition to Trade Union principles.Hayes, the union Secretary, and Thiel have approaohed the SailorsSoldiers&apos; $ Airmeb*s Union to find them 1000 , discharged&apos; soldiers Of Polio^ age and height, whom they propose to put into polioe uniform for some disorderly 1 demonstration.   &quot;If we:; dbn&apos;.t; do&apos; something drastic,&quot; they said?the.Union will be dead in three months.&quot;    Hayes is now touring the Northern towns.,     &quot; he, Union has received&apos;r of support from theLeioester Iron Trades Federation and other looal bodies, but it realizes that it cannot count upon a sympathetic strikewhen/
when It comes to the point of resistance.EBB COAL question the oriels in the mining industry, which is likelyto prove the supreme test of industrial power, can be traoel) to four immediate causes:1)    !&amp;* Sankey report. whioh includes the 6s. increase. 2)    intervention in Russia. 3)    The extension of the Military Service act. 4)    !ttie high oost of living.The 6s. increase, the effect of whioh was foreshadowed in my report last week, was the oruoial point of the; Miners1 Conference at Keswiok, and the keynote of the Conference mi suspicion and mistrust of the Government.   The prevailing opinion was that Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s offer was merely an attempt to fend off a Cabinet decision of nationalization.    The cni good point in the Conference was the refusal to confer on, the Executive the power to oall a strike without a ballot -in other words the defeat of direct aotion.It is to be remembered that the strike of Yorkshire miners is not unofficial, though contrary to the advioe of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain..-   The Yorkshire Miners1 Association, in common; with other units of the Federation, has power to call a local strike.  My correspond reports that the temper of the men is ugly and that they are inolined towards senseless damage. ;There are, however, cross-currents of opinion that are bound to affepi the situation,There is a growing feeling among the superior artisans,,;even in the Triple Alliance, that working men, as well as capitalists, are being taxed for the benefit of one section of labour, and the men who are being thrown out of work- by; Ibhe organisation of the miners $ are beooming restive.Amongst sections of the workers, particularly in liverpool/
Liverpool, there is bitter feeling against the miners. , There is little doubt that the bulk of the ciners . understand nationalization to mean, not ownership of the mines by tho. public, but ownership by- the miners for the .. miners.The Triple Alliance mot yesterday behind closed doors, $haft tho &quot;Bed Plagw was sung shows that an, undue proportion of the Delegates were extremists and not representative of the bulk of labour.   Though a resolution was oarried unanimously to oontinue the strike, it is significant that the Transport Workers1 representatives deoided not to oall a strike but to refer the question to a ballot of their members.  They would scarcely have done this if they felt sure of the obedienoe of their members, and the delay entailed by the ballot is all to the good.Mr. Smillie presided over the Committee appointed to draw up a communique to the Press.   Smillie is reported to be losing influence with the steadier miners.4s I anticipated in earlier reports, the international strike against intervention has been a failure.   The Confederation Generale du Travail decided against the strike at the eleventh hour and similar action was taken in Italy.    In Norway, however, the majority of workmen absented themselves from work on July 21st.- ;In England the only strikes of importance were those of the London.Dockers, the HorWich Boot and Shoe Operatives and the, ilerthyr Miners.Demonstrations, the only form of protest sanctioned by the Labour Party, were held, with varying sucoess, throughout the Country. t In London the chief demonstrations were in Trafalgar 8quare and in Victoria Park.    At the former, the extremists, represented by Kavanagh and Miss 0&apos;Neill, established themselves/
themselves on the east  plinth, more or less In opposition   1 to the Labour Party, who oooupied the North plinth.   The    &apos; meeting was stormy and soldiers finally rushed the platform! chased the agitators and destroyed the Red Flag.&quot;&apos; whioh they replaced by the Union Jack.    Similar friction between the two Labour bodies was manifest at Victoria, where George Lansbury and Sylvia Pankhurst addressed some 200 people.At Leeds the demonstration, in spite of tho presence of Mrs. Snowdon and Mr. \V. Lunn, M,P,, was a failure, and an! evening meeting attracted only 400 people, and in the Cardif area the demonstrators were roughly handled by soldiers. The offioial resolution of the Labour Party was, however, passed in a great many towns.When the extraordinary efforts of the extremists to effect a universal 24 hours&apos; strike are considered in the light of results, it is olear that his earnings mean more to the British workman than solidarity with his Russian comrade.&quot;PROFITEERING&quot; - * -There is a rising tide of-resentment against the &quot;Profiteers&quot; who are supposed to be responsible for the high prioes of food, and the Food Controller^ warning that pricei are likely to rise still higher has been very badly reoeived Working men are so ignorant of the elementary facts of fioonomios that they decline to believe that increased production is the only remedy for high prices^ Profiteering and not scarcity is to them the only oause, and they demand that proved profiteers should be sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.   It does not occur to them that they themselvei in common with other classes, are profiteers, and that the most shameless instances of profiteering are to be found the rents charged to them by householders of their own olasfl There are oases in London in whioh such householders are living/
... &apos; - 5 - 236living rent free and deriving a profit by sub-letting single rooms at an exorbitant rate, &quot;tha housing question &apos;   .There is no abatement in the aggravation caused by look of houses, and there is evidenoe that the handling of the housing problem by the extremists is bearing fruit.   In the Leeds area it is openly asserted that there is no solution of the problem as long as capitalism exists.   .The laok of houses is one of the principal oauses of discontent amohfe disoharged soldiers, whose absence on Service prevented them from obtaining houses when there was an S    opportunity,TH3 FBSLINa AMONG DI8CH:ftQffiD SOLDIERSNext to the ooal question, the grievances of ex-Servioe men are the most serious troubles&apos;of the moment.   During the past week there have been signs from every part of the oountry of a spirit of discontent-and unrest,that may break out with very serious oonsequenoes at any moment,  at Birmingham, the stronghold&apos;of the National Union of Ex-Servioe Men, a meeting of some 500 disoharged men passed a resolution on July 20th, demanding an increase &quot;of 50$ on pensions, and arrears of pay for all ex-Service men at the rate of 4/6 or 5/- per diem, the&apos; difference-between British.and Australian pay.    This claim was first advanced by R.L, Outhwaite in the &apos; Daily Herald&apos; of the 9th June/and is part of the programme of the Commonwealth League.    The &apos;Daily Ferald&apos;, in pursuance of its policy of fomenting disoontent amongst Service men, has now had the artiole reprinted in pamphlet form.  The National Union of flx-Servioe Men is making a great effort to obtain the support of labour;  a new branch has been formed at Wokefield.1  It is significant that but opposition as was offered to- &apos; . the/
the Peaoe Celebrations oamo from demobilised soldiers.   InManohester and Liverpool discharged men have threatened tomaroh to London to onforoe their demands, billeting themselupon the .towns they pass.   In Liverpool there is very stronHfeeling against the employment of women in Government off ic The men consider that -female labour should be exoluded from Post Offices, Customs and iOxoise and Pensions.On July 21st some 700 demobLlised soldiers demanded that recruiting posters should be removed from the Labour Exchange in manchester,   Obtaining no satisfaction, they to: the posters down themselves and then held an indignation meeting, at whioh a resolution demanding work or an unomplojl donation of  2 per week was passed,The Peaoe Celebrations showed how easily a orowd of mei in this temper may break into riot.   The rather serious riof at Luton, which resulted in the burning of the Town Hail an the looting of shops, the riots at Coventry, Bilston (where an attempt was made to bum the Polioe Station), Swindon an Fareham, though in no way instigated by the looal branches of diaohargcd soldiers, are an indication of the infiawmabll temper of the men and their accessibility to the wiles of the agitator.   This temper is undoubtedly having it3 effeot upon the colliers as a whole, and though the disoharged soldiers in the West Yorkshire area have moderate leaders and the unrest was industrial rather than political up to Sunday last, the feeling has undergone a deoided ohange for the worse.At manchester and Barrow there were oounter-demonstrations by disoharged soldiers, and at Leeds members of the local branoh of the National Federation of Discharge and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers abstained from the ^ celebrations on instructions from their oommittee.In Glasgow celebrations have been postponed until August 4th, owing to the Pair.   fix-Servioe men there arearranging
arranging a oounter-deiaonstration.It is believed that the disoontent would be greatly allayed if an addition to&apos; the pensions oould be announced, and there ware some ocular evidence that house building was in progress,   There are undoubtedly many ex-soldiers who do not want work at all and would not take it if it were offered, but there are also many rather piteous oases in every district, whioh are exploited by the local agitators with distastrous results.WITHDRAWALS PROM WAR LO.iNThere is a growing feeling against the investment ofTrade Union funds in War Loan.  Demands for the withdrawalof money already invested have been made at Leeds, Batley andDewsbury, as well as by various branohes of the amalgamated society of Engineers.   Probably the motive is to show.   rather   .disapproval of the present Government/than a feeling that the War Loan is an inseoure investment, but whatever may be the oause the movement seems likely to grow.unrhsst mom agricultural ygMLWMAlthough the disputes amongst farm workers in South , Wales appear to be settled, there.are signs of growing discontent in other areas.   In the  ast Riding the agricultural labourers are becoming interested in political -i....-; affairs, and recently passed a resolution oovering oonsoription, ;      intervention in Russia, profiteering and non-unionism. Discontent is manifest in Warwickshire and Oxfordshire.fflJMS ON THS NORTH EASTCT MILWAYThough now settled, this strike is an illustration of the present spirit among labour.   The pretext was trivial, sinoe the eye-sight test, whioh was mads the excuse, is said to have been originally instituted at ths request of the men themselves.   Moreover, the strike was opposed by theNational/
National Union of Railwaymen.   The significant feature is that the tendency for the power to pass out of the hands of the Trade Union offioials. into those of the extreme men is growing.There is now definite evidence that the Communist Government in Buda Pesth has reoeived instructions from the Bolsheviks in Mosoow to supply Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, either direotly or through the 1 Dally Herald&apos;, with information. X reported last week that Miss Pankhurst had reoeived a sum of  300 from a Bolshevik emissary from Norway.  She has taken the trouble to deny this in the &quot;Daily Herald1 of the 19th July, but unfortunately for her reputation for veracity, Zaohariassen, before-leaving-JBngland, made a confession that he brought the money from Stockholm and delivered it to her. There is strong reason for believing that the money, whioh wa^j in iSngiish notes, oame originally from Buda pesth.It is a curious fact that Miss Pankhurst has come under the suspicion of her associates that she herself, either unwittingly or intentionally, betrayed ZaohariaBsen to the authorities, and the transaction has been damaging to Jier influence.    The Russians even believe&apos; her to be an agent of the Government.    She is now talking wildly of making . personal reprisals upon some important personage.Ramsay has been comparatively tame sinoe his release from prison.   He addressed an audienoe of 500 people on  uly 15th, but his speech was moderate, although he advocated direot aotion.   After a short holiday he will take Watson&apos;s plaoe. HSIR EDWARD CARSON&apos;3 SPflSCKThis speeoh has had an unfortunate effeot.   labour members/
&quot; &apos;    -9- 298&apos;Members of Parliament, extremists and labour opinion generally is comparing the treatment of leaders, suoh as Gallaoher, . Beiasay and v/dtson, with the lack of action whore the &quot;privileged class&quot; is oonoerned.THE) BRITISH J3MPIHB UNIOIIMeetings of this Union were, held during the past week at. Aberdare, Pontypool, 2?ewport and Merthyr.   The prinoipal speakers were Mr.C,B. Stanton, M.P., and Mr; Luboff, editor of the ^ssian Outlook&apos;,    kXl these meetings were broken up by organized bands, and a further meeting arranged for Mountain Ash was abandoned in oonsequenoe.This paper continues its misohievous campaign.   The employment of sailors to keep the Yorkshire mines clear of water has been attacked as &quot;blaoklegging&quot; and &quot;strike breaking&quot;, The paper is now exposing what it oalls &quot;princely dividends&quot;. Up till quite lately it was reported to be losing  800 a week and finanoe is undoubtedly its vulnerable point, yet a full page Government advertisement appeared in the issue of July 22nd, apparently sent by the Director of Publicity, Ministry of munitions.. This adyertisement dealt with lands, faotories, dook equipment, explosives and a number of articles whioh oould not possibly be purchased by working men.   But apart from this, it may be mentioned that,the advertisement of the Victory Loan, which appeared in the issue of June 13th, was made the occasion for an attack upon the Loan in the leading article.   It is to be hoped that. Government Departments will not prolong the life of this paper by subsidising the advertisement columns, which are reoeiving so little support from trading concerns,. ,: ^ \The circulation of the paper in the Horth is said to be increasing.    Unfortunately the sporting correspondent had the good fortune to spot several winners lately;, and the men whobuy/
buy the paper for this reason are reported now to be reading ^ its editorial columns with more care. AIn order to illustrate the straits to which the &quot;Herald ^? is reduced for increasing its circulation, it may be mention that Jaok Tenner, the revolutionary, was asked,the other o^ji to prepare a dummy bomb and deposit it.   X photographer was be present to snap the Polioe in the act of discovering the boab, whioh was to contain a copy of the *Do.ily Herald&apos;. Tanner rather wisely deolined to undertake this commission.lhIni hThere is still but little in the Irish press about de Valera&apos;s amerioan Mission, though references to his visit show that hopes are still fixed in that direction.   Father 0&apos;Flanagan is continuing his leoture tour on Agricultural Co-operation in Galway and Mayo and is studiously avoiding politics.   Both &quot;nationality&quot; and &quot;The Irishman&quot; print artio which practically amount to valedictory addresses to him on Jc behalf of Sinn Fein.   :\rthur Griffith has resumed the Editorship of the former paper.The labour situation shows no marked change, though strikes of agricultural labourers on a rather extensive scale are in progress in Kildare, Heath&apos;,&apos; Galvmy and Cork. In Heath,&apos; cattle Were turned back from market unless the ;  drivers oould produoe a permit from the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union.Ho tendenoy towards Bolshevism is observable, nor has any revolutionary literature come under notice.Thomas McDonnell presided at a large Sinn Fein meeting at St. Mungo&apos;^ Hallv Scotstoun, on July 14th.   The mainsubj of disoussion was the Independence of the Irish P^publio - t obtain which no half measures would suffice.   I hear that McDonnell, Who is President of the Scottish Sinn Fein Bxeout! receives  6 per week from the Dublin Exeoutive for organizing] in Sootland.   Thomas White is his assistant, but only gets his expenses.B,H.T.
