TlyH. D^vwfr^t to- t***J Prop^&quot;*v - ofHiftwfi^l%,v^iy&apos;3 government from Viceroy, 22nd July 1919. (Received 23rd.)1073 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 21st July :-&quot; Reported by Khyber that Lashkar in Bazar has dispersed and the jirgas have returned to Tirah. All is quiet. Kurram reports that Nadir Khan in an interview with some Alisher Zai said that if Orakzais would rise he would again attack in order to support them, armistice or no armistice, but that Amir&apos;s orders prevented him from taking the initiative. Donald, who came through Kohat Pass on 19th to see me, returning 20th, reports state of feeling amongst Adam Khel Afridis good. He saw several jirgas who were trying to recover rifles from deserters. Latter were resisting, but were told plainly that they could expect no support from tribe. In spite of many invitations, Pass Afridis declined to have anything to do with Shah-gassi Lashkar in Bazar. Elders decided to impose very heavy fines upon anybody committing offences on the road, and to burn offenders&apos; village in case of refusal to pay. Raiding has (corrupt group) in Kohat, and Donald considers any general rising of Orakzais unlikely, though certain sections will probably continue to raid, and especially to carry off Hindus for ransom.   All districts and agencies reported quiet.&quot;-Following from Baluchistan, dated 21st July :-&quot; Numerous small raids in past few days seem to show that Abdul Qudus is now deliberately adopting policy of sending small gangs into our territory. Gulistan Bazar twice raided Shinakhoa post between Hindu Bagh and Kila Saifulla burnt on 18th July; gangs Durani and Ghilzais looted camels of the A.C.R.E. (? Ahmadzais) killed Hindu at Sirki Jangul between Loralai and Kila Saifulla yesterday. So-called Afghan brigadiers with armed sowars, believed to be Afghan regulars from. Kala Rashid, moving in hills close to Hindu Bagh and forcibly collecting supplies from Kanchogai and surrounding villages. Efforts being made to verify fact of their being regulars. Local tribesmen so far behaving well, but situation is very trying for them. Afghan policy evidently directed towards impressing us with the idea that our tribesmen are on their side, and that our position on border will be intolerable unless we yield to them in negotiations. They ignore the obvious fact that if we were obliged to resume hostilities, and our troops advanced into Afghan territory, these tribal raids on our borders would cease, as we should be behind them.&quot;
