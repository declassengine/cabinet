-(This Document la the -property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government) ..   WAR CAB HOT. Secret. &quot;G.f. 7704. &quot;Control of.Hay&quot;.Memorandum &quot;by the President of to Board of Agriculture andFisheries,I agree with the President of the Board of Trade (G.T. 7675) that there is likely to be a considerable shortage of hay for town sup-oliee.   The crop of hay in England and Wales is certainly not more than would be normally retained by farmers for consumption in view of the scarcity of roots, oat-straw, and concentrated feeding stuffs. Scotland and Ireland are in a better position and though crop estimates are not as yet available Ireland may be expected to have a surplus for export.Granting that some measure of control may be necessary I am strongly of opinion that the method adopted last year of withdrawing frcm the farmer all hay over and above his minimum requirements for his own stock should not be followed again.   In the first place farmers will set their requirements high and will be the less inclined to economise and substitute straw.   More hay will probably be obtainable from the farmers under a system of free sale than by commandeering.   Secondly if the faroersv hay is commandeered at a low price they will ask with justice for corresponding prices to be fixed for cake and offals. Fixing the price of cake and offals involves similar interference with the price of oils and fats for margarine and with flour, and will re-introduce the whole machinery of control,   I agree that the proposals of Sir Auckland Geddes will best meet the situation - that the Central Council should be authorised to buy hay on Government account in order to form a reserve.   If prices show a tendency to rise above  15 to the consumer the Board of Trade will then announce maximum selling and buying prices, and the Central Council will use their reserve to furnish districts which by reason of the maximum prices find a difficulty in obtaining supplies.   The hay imported by the Board of Trade would be used to the same end,I am informed that a fair quantity of hay is obtainable in Canada at prices of from  7 to  8, and a letter received by the Board indicates that at least one importer in Liverpool is considering the purchase of hay in Canada if he can be assured that control will not be renewed and importation will be free.   This letter in itself shows-the value? of an open market in attracting supplies, and for that reason I an of opinion that the fixing even of maximum prices should be deferred as long as cof-sible.   I further wish to be able to announce to farmers that hay will not be   commandeered save under stress of real national necessity.ERNLS.July 16th, 1919.
