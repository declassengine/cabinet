From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 18th July 1919. (Received 19th.)

10598. Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel dated 18th July :-

"Abdul Qadyum telegraphs [from Landi Kotal 17th instant 18 hours:-&apos;This morning Afridi lashkar in Bazar was estimated at several thousands. A detachment of 30 or 40 Afghans with a few loaded mules reached (? China Vanderspar) 10 a.m. to-day with news that Shagassi is returning this evening with promised support and has directed lashkar to move to Chura which they started to do at once headed by Mullahs of Said Akhbar. Ali Masjid might possibly be sniped at to-night and attacked to-morrow Friday. Tone of lashkar is warlike.&apos;

"This lashkar is the force recruited from Afridi deserters by Shagassi. Kazi Abdul Wali the Afghan Postmaster&apos;s principal agent in Peshawar who fled to Kabul before the city arrests has arrived at Bazar with three other Peshawaris and an escort of 100 Afghan soldiers. He has brought several mule loads of presents from the Amir for Afridis and states that he has been appointed by Amir for management of Afridi affairs. I have just received a message that a demonstration has been made in the neighbourhood of Ali Masjid this morning but have no details. Many loyal Maliks and retired native officers have arrived at Bazar and are attempting to control lashkar. Shagassi has not arrived although he was expected yesterday and has not sent rations or (? ammunition) and the Afridis have sent messages to him that unless he does so at once they will break up. Zakka Khel of Bazar have protested strongly against the presence of Aghan forces in their limits and have removed their families to the hills in order not to give supplies. Jirga Pakhai Zakka Khel of the Khyber has gone to Bazar to protest against invasion of Zakka Khel limits. Abdul Qadyum thinks that in the absence of more tangible complementary support lashkar may break up. Messengers are coming to him hourly from lashkars."
