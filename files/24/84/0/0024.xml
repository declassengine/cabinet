(This Document Is thejffipertyjgfHis Britannic. iVkijssty&apos;s Government)/(Circulated by the Home (Secretary),DEPORTATION OF ALIEN SKIftllES.0O0In grand oommittoo on the Aliens Restriction Bill a new clause has been inserted by a majority of 2 (14 to 12) making it compulsory, subject to certain limited and ill-drawn categories of exemption, to deport forth-with all subjects of tho enemy or ex-enemy powers who still remain in this country, whether interned or uninterned.The Clause, which I resisted on behalf of tho Government, was supportod mainly, if not entirely, on a mistaken interpretation of pledges alleged to havo boon given at tho general election on behalf of the Government.Tho Clause would involve vory great inhumanity and cruelty to inoffen-sive persons with British born wives and children, in many oases, who have spent the greater part of their lives in this country.As regards tho uninterned, who have all been passed under review more than once during the war and have been allowed to romain hero till now, the Clause if passed into law would moan that the work of two Advisory Commit-toos presided over by two Judges of the High Court would be disregarded. As to the interned, the work of the Committee of five members of Parliament which during the last two months has boon dealing with these oases under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Younger, would bo repudiated and wasted.    The latter Committee was appointed in consequence of a pledge given and a policy announced in the House of Lords on behalf of tho Government on tho 3rd April last.    Apart from tho morits of the case, it is impossible to treat in this way the disinterested work of public men and judges of tho High Court done on tho invitation of the Government.A memorandum on the subject prepared by Mr. Justice Younger is annexed and I would draw the attention of my colleagues to tho views expressed therein by one who is in possession of almost unique knowledge on the subject.I may add that tho Clause involves the anomaly of treating former enemy aliens in time of peace with greater severity than we have shown to the same persons when enemy aliens during tho war.. I propose if my colleagues concur to take all necessary steps to havo the Clause struck out of the Bill on the report stage in the House of Commons.( )16th July, 1919.E.S.
SIR JOHN 25UTOII12R*S NEW CLAUSE AS &quot;0 deportation of ^pdicaaa Braanr;alots .----oOo -.....1.      This now olauao has boon road a second time in Standing Committee on the.Aliens Restriction Bill.&apos;    It was carried against Govornmcnt op-jjtosition. &apos; It in full of gaps and other defects and could vory easily bo riddled by destructive criticism in detail.   :But it is not proposed hero to indulge in that- oxorciso,    The purpose of this memorandum is to show, and it is hopod to prove, that this or any other clause framed on similar lines is fundamentally inadmissible under existing conditions, and cannot be amended so as to make it tolerable,2.      The clause reflects the very extreme vicw3 hold by its authors on all questions relating to Gorman aliens naturalized or un-naturalizod. On no other hypothesis can the crudity of its provisions bo explained but it3 promoters ask for its acceptance on the alleged ground that its insertion in tho Bill is imperiously called for in ordor to fulfil cer-tain plodgos stated by them to have been givon by the Prime Minister and the present Lord Chancellor in tho course of tho recent general Election,3.      The allegation is a strange one when the terms of tho clause are looked at.    For while its authors assert that tho Prime -Minister and the Lord chancellor presumably with thoir own entire approval, pledged the Government that every Gorman then in the country would bo compulsor-ily deported on the conclusion of peaoe, they propose to fulfil that pledge-by a clause narrowed on the one hand by what look like widespread exemptions of Germans and extended on the other hand to every one of our former enemies and not Germans only.4,      But the real answer to the allegation is that no such pledge was over given,    Tho pledges of the Prime iiinistor relied on were in express terms, and those of the Lord Chancellor wore by reasonably necessary implication confined,&apos;to those alien enemies and to those alone who had abused our hospitality a? plotters and spies,    &quot;They&quot; said the Prime Minister- at tho Queens Hall before the election, &quot;have forfeited their claim tfe remain&quot;.     &quot;i have repeatedly 3aid&quot;, ho added on tho oamo occasion, &quot;that in my judgment these people having abused our hospitality must not get another opportunity of doing so,&quot;5,      Thero is no question of going back upon that pledge.    The policy of the Government already announced gives full effeot to it.    In tho case of such people tho enemy alion question can present no ground for difference of opinion,    Evoryono must agree that tho only thing to be&apos; -dono is to got rid of these enemies out of hand one and all.    It may, however, in passing be observed, a3 ono of tho minor criticisms upon tho olause under review, that it would indubitably fail of that result if there wore in fact now left in this country in any substantial number, onemy aliens of that despicable type,
6.      But thoro arc not.    Tho position now is vary clifforont from tho situation as it prosontod itself vvhon tho Primo Miniotor spoke.     Then thoro were, aa thoro aro now, about 21,000 unintcrnod enemy aliens in thio country. But whereas thoro wore thon 24,. 000 interned enemy aliens there are now only 4,500,     Tho remaining iy,500 doubtless anticipating in most casoG their ultimate destiny have already roturned to their own country.7.      Now tho Primo Minister was not speaking of the unintornod.    Those had remained at largo because in the judgment of the competent authorities including one or both of tho Advisory Committees they-had shown themselves loyal to this country and tho Allies and otherwise dependable and nothing has-since ocourred to modify that judgment. &apos;&apos;8.      It was amongst tho 24,000 interned that the plotters and spies, of whom the Primo Minister spoke were to be found, and of these, as-has been, shown, nearly 20,000 have already gone, and amongst them it is safe to say most if not all of the knaves.     The justification for that statement is that an Advisory Committee consisting of fivo members of Parliament and myself, .. ha3 been for the last two months examining the individual claims to exemption from deportation put forward by each of these 4,500 aliens, and so far no well-founded suspicion either of plotting or spying&apos; has attached to any- of them. -;9.      The net result, therefore,&apos;is that the only pledge given by the Primo Minister is already all but fulfilled? &apos; it&quot; is still being rigorously carried out in the case of every onemy alien to whom it is discovered to apply, and in the task of discovering him the; Government,,have the assistance not only of all the usual Civil and.Military&apos;Authorities but also of the Advisory Com-mittee to which reference has already; boon made.     It is submitted with some confidence that no more effective moans for attaining tho purpose in hand could bo divieod.10.     That so-called justification for the clause disposed of we may now proceed to contrast the Government method of dealing with tho alien problem as it now exists with tho provisions of this new clause designed to supersede that method. . ...   .11. . The aliens oo - ornod aro - -1. Tho 21,000 uninterhed. &apos;&apos;2. The 4,500 still interned.12.     The Government proposals with regard to the uninternod aro simple. Tho Homo Secretary will have power to deport any of them as and when it appears to him necessary, in tho public interest no to do.     nothing more it is submitted is required in the national interest.    Anything more would.be needlessly oppressive to the alien. .   For it must always be remembered who these aliens are.    Many of them aro enemy only in name.     They aro Czechs, Poles otc.    All of them, as has been shown, are aliens who. during tho shock of war have boon reported upon favourably by tho Military and the Police and have lived at liberty in this country void of known or suspected offence. Their cases have been exhaustively reviewed in the course of the war by two Advisory Committees presided over by judges of the High Court,.    By one or
othor or both of thooo Committees thoy have already boon exempted from deportation or intornmant. Thoy aro for the most part aliens of long residence of advanced or of tondor yoars, or of npooial accomplishment.If any aliens at all aro to remain in this country it is submitted, that nothing short of serious apprehended injury to national interests would justify the indiscriminate deportation nor/ that peace has been attained of those people who havo passed the ordeal of such close scru-tlny and havo oo fully justified the confidence placed in thorn during the war.    Especial point is added to thi3 submission when regard is had to the widespread suffering to which in the great majority of instances their British born dependants would inevitably be subjectod if India-criminate deportation were now decreed.13.    It would seem that the authors of this clause arc woll aware that somo justification for extending it to.the unintornod must be shown and Sir John Butcher its protagonist has accordingly maintained that it is directed against those of the unintornod whoso cases owing to the oon-cluoion of the Armistioo wore not re-examined by the 1918 Committee. On this it may bo observed that there is nothing in the clause to exempt -those whose cases woro. so re-examined.    They have to go through the mill again like all tho others.But apart from that it is indeed surprising to find suoh a juntif1-cation of tho clause put forward by a member of that Gommittoo.It suggests that tho internments and doportatlons recommended by it woro based upon proof or suspicion that tho aliens in quostion had been unworthy of the confidence imposed in thorn by tho 1915 Committee or were otherwise dangerous.    Very different is tho fact.    I doubt whether any singlo internment or deportation was recommended by the 1918 Committee &apos;on tho scoro of any offonoe either proved or suspocted.-What that Committoo did, yielding to a wave of intelligible although uninstructed popular feeling (tho Harrogato case is a good instance of the fables that were ourrent) was to raise generally the period of residence required to justify exemption, and in tho case of tho young men, who had grown up since 1915, to recommend internment or a labour battalion however good their behaviour had been in order that tho glaring disparity between their position and that of young Britons who had to join tho colours might bo removed.    That was all.    The investigations of the Com-mittoe clearly demonstrated that sO far as any question of danger from tho continued exemption of the aliens was concerned, the work of the 1915 Cftmmittoo had been woll nigh perfect.    In other werds that Committee had taken no risks.    Danger there was none loft.14.    Wo now come to the Governments action with reference to tho 4,500 cnomy aliens who remain interned.    Of theso it must first bo observed that internment by no means necessarily, connotoo oither disloyalty or bad character or spying or plotting.    Undesirables and criminals and spies there wore amongst the interned.     These for tho mo3t part woro caught by the Polioo at the beginning  of tho war;   thoy remained interned through
out its continuance and as ha3 boon seen they have now boon sent baok to their own country.    Tho remaining interned found thomoolvea in that position for tho most part because they woro of military ago and of relatively short rosidenoe.    In vory fow instances indeed was there any suggestion against their personal characters.    But a young man in his vigour was in timo of war potentially dangerous:   and no risks could be taken.Now the 4,500 who remain aro amongst.the best of those, only a propor-tion of them aro Gorman,    Tho root3 of many are entirely in this country and they are men for tho moot part with strong claims to exemption from deportation-tion, through in vory many oases their British-born dependants as well as on their own merits,    Many of them for instance havo done most notable national service during the war having been temporarily released for that purpose.Those individual claims are being laboriously and exhaustively considcr-ed by tho Advisory Committee consisting of 5 members of Parliament and myself already referred to.    That Committee has boon engaged upon the work for over two months.    It is being assisted by tho Police and the Military Authorities, Its labours are approaching completion.    If this olauco is allowed to remain part of the Bill its work will be entirely thrown away.The Committee I fool sure will make no cenplaint on that score so far as its members personally are concerned.    But if their continued work is to bo useless it is only fair that they should be at once reloased from the1^1&apos;0 further prosecution of their painful task,15     But there is more.     Tho Committee was appointed in fulfilment of an official statement of Government policy made in the House of Lords on tho 3rd April and the interned aliens concerned were officially promised that their fate would depend upon its recommendations.No objection to that policy was made in either house.    In the House of Lords it was warmly approved;   and thereupon, and in pursuance of it, the Committee entered upon its work,     Tho aliens concerned were invited officially to put forward before the Committee their claims for exemption, - They havo done so and these are all being carefully sifted and dealt with.    Tho clause now under consideration, if it romain part of the Bill, will nullify the promise so made and accepted.16.    But ovon this, although it would scorn to amount to something like a breach of faith might not be decisive, if it could even now bo shown that this clause with its arbitrary categories of exemption would secure a better result than that obtained by the impartial investigation of tho cases now in progress.17.    The very opposite is tho case.    Experience has shown (as I believe will be agreed by all competent to express an opinion on tho matter) that no cast iron categories can be devised capable of universal application inwards and outwards.    Categories with no objection by the Police in tho individual case aro useful guides to oxemption.     Non-inolusion in a category is in many instances no justification at all for deportation,     Tho cases are infinitely various and, oven so far as tho individual alien is concerned, a category can never be more than a guide - it must not beoome a chain.    So far, however, as concerns the dependants - the wives and children, (British-born wives and cfci.Hr -.. - &apos; &apos;.
ren for tho moat part tho wive a in many cases with brothers and .iers who have fought and died in the war) the categories applicable to io alien himself barely serve even as a guide.The problem so far as these unfortunates are concerned usually is to settle what are the conditions under which it is fair that they, ignorant of every language but English;, are to be presented with the teriblo   alter-native of going tith thoir husband and father to a country they loathe or of remaining here bereft of the protection and support of a husband and a father they love.    Fairness and humanity alike demand that before depor-tation of the man san properly be ordered the claims to consideration of these British born dependants of his must bo carefully and independently weighed, and that is being done.18.     So muoh for the declared Government policy now in full operation. What of tho alternative as embodied in tho now clause?19. Some of tho main objections to it have already been indioated. They are indeed infinite,     Here are a few summarised.1. It introduces into a statutory enactmont in a case where the introduction is quite gratuitous the undesirable dis-tinction after the peace between the status in this country of former enemy and other resident aliens.    It fails even to discriminate between the nationals of one enemy country and - those of the others great as is that distinction in tho pop-ular view,2. It throws on one side the results of the laborious work during the war of two Advisory Committees, &apos;*&apos;f the Police, the Military and the. Home Office who between them have in-vestigated tho circumstances of every enemy alien in the country.3, It substitutes for an intelligent judgment based on tho circumstances and justice of every oase a series of arbi-trary categories impossible as they stand but inoapable even of being made adequate or satisfactory. 4. It ignores the claims to consideration of the British born wives and children of the aliens conoerned and oon-demnsAhem without discrimination to gratuitous suffer-ing.5. It metes out as a fitting reward for loyalty and good conduct during the war;. compulsory&apos;deportation after the peace.6. Negatively it achieves no useful purpose not attained by tho Government system.20.     It is submitted that in no circumstances should such a proposal be allowed to become law.(-Signed) ROBERT YOUNGER.7th July, 1919,.
