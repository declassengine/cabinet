After his withdrawal from Traus-caspia to Meshed, Mall esoninstituted enquiries as to the possibility of raising Kurd levies in country round Knchan, Bujnurd with object of meeting possible Bolshevik incursions into Khorassan. This source had not previously been tapped, as Kurds decline to serve outside their own country.2. Having enlisted nucleus of 30 mounted men, Malleson asked our permission in April last to expand to 100, and to be prepared to expansion to 300 if necessary. Proposal was supported by Teheran, and we approved., 3. On 27th June Malleson telegraphed that good material was forthcoming, and asked permission to enlist that total 300 immediately. In view of situation in Trail s-Caspia, we have approved in anticipation of your sanction.4. Cost of whole 300 is estimated at 8,000 tomans monthly, or less. Their duties are to maintain order in turbulent area, acting as despatch riders on Kuchan-Bajgiran and Kuchan-Bujnurd roads, deal with armed gangs of refugees constantly entering Persia, and generally to serve as military support in case of Bolshevik incursion. Malleson also states that have marked steadying effect on Khan of Bujnurd.5. Your confirmation is requested.
