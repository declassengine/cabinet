MM.IOHAlJDuH TO THIi QABIIfiiT BY THD HOME SECKI/.illHISTER 03? MOUR.WIGHT BAXIKGr,It io necessary for us to ask for an early deeision of the Cabinet as to the aotion to be taken on the Report of the ^   Committee appointed to enquire into night work in the Baling Trade.The Committee, after a careful review of the conditions in the different parts of the country, unanimously recommend    that night work between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. should be abolished, subject to certain exceptions, but that in view of the difficulty of obtaining new plant and carrying out the reorganization which will be necessary in many bakeries, the statutory prohibition of night worl: should not take effect until two years after the passing of legislation.   They think, however, that night work should wherever possible be discontinued from now onwards by mutual agreements between the representative organizations in the trade.   The Comisittoe are satisfied that the trade difficulties can bo overcome, and the interests of the public who require bread reaonnably fresh and at reasonable times will be safeguarded, if the provisions v/hioh they recommend are adopted.\7e think that legislation to give effect to the Committee^ recommendations should be promised immediately in view of the acute unrest among the men on the subject.   The Master Bayers aro not likely to take any active steps to prepare for the abolition of night work until they know that the Government intend to act on the Committee1s Report.   We therefore propose that a Bill should be prepared immediately and introduced in the Autumn providing for the abolition of night work after the 21st December, 1921.The Pood Controller is. pressing for the revocation of the Twelve Hour Clause of tho Bread Order on the grounds that it is no longer neoessary in the public interest and is being largely disregarded, and the Committee see no reason for its continuance. It has been kept in foroe. against the wishes of the Pood Controller, in order not to precipitate a crisis with the men by the resumption of night baking, pending tho issue of tho QommittooIs Report.   A meeting of the Joint Industrial Council has been summoned for the  6th or S8th instant, in order to discuss the situation created by the Committee^ proposals, and until that meeting has been held it would be a mistake to revoke tho Twelve Hour Clause, but wo should like to be able to anounce to the meeting that the Twelve Hour Clause will be revoked as from the 1st of August.-je therefore desire tho authority of the Cabinet to announce(1) that legislation will be prepared immediately to give of foot to tho Committee^ recommendation for the abolition of night vjork as from the 31st December, 1921,(2) that the Twelve Hour Clause in tho Bread Order will be revoked as from the 1st of August.21st July, 1919.ECHOP.TT. r.s..H0HNI3.
