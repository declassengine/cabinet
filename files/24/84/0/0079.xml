23rd July, 19X9. THE! TRIPLE U&amp;I&amp;NGfl) WMEUfitOBThe Triple Alliance held its oonferenoe behind olosed doors this afternoon.   I am Informed that it was deoided by an overwhelming majority to foroe the adoption of the Sankey Report by direot aotion, and also tha abolition of conscription, the release of poiitioal prisoners and withdrawal of British troops from Bussia immediately.   X ballot Is to bo taken among the Transport Workers to see whether they will join the miners in any aotion they may take.   It is not clear what part the railwaymen are to play, unless they are included among the Transport Workers.   An offioial announcement is being issued to the Press.The meeting terminated with the singing of the &quot;Red Flag&quot;.Apparently this means that the miners will remain, on strike and other miners may follow them, but that the Transport Workers will not take aotion until the ballot is returned.B.H.T.
