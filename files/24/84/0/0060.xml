From Viceroy, 20th July 1919-. (Received 21st, 4.15 p.m.)Clear the line.1061- S.   Following from Roos-Keppell, dated 15th July :--&quot; Political Agent, Malakand, reports Kabul part)&apos; in Dir headed by Satbar Khan recently dismissed. Principal Ministers are trying&apos; to induce NawaVs second son Alamzeb to set himself up against his father, but as yet without success. Every kind of pressure is being put upon Nawab, but hitherto he has remained firm. A well-known Mullah called Shal Badshah went to Dir to&apos;demand from Nawab definite statement whether he was a Musalman or a Kafir, but Nawab turned him back forcibly. Activity of Afghan agents in Bajaur increases, and they are giving out that eagerness of British to conclude peace is clue to knowledge that large reinforcements of Turks and Bolsheviks are on their way. Afghan emissaries are distributing copies received from Kabul of report by Nadir Khan describing his capture of Thai, Miramshah, Wano, and Sarwekai. Telegraphic communication with Chitral broken somewhere beyond (corrupt group) Bandipur. All quiet in other districts&apos; and agencies. Political Agent, Khyber, has received no news of departure from Kabul of Afghan delegates. It is believed that general public in Kabul are anxious for. peace and for despatch of delegates, but that war party oppose their despatch; also that Amir is making delay in hopes of receiving assistance from Bolsheviks, and of exciting risings amongst frontier tribes. Nawab of Amb reports that two German experts from Kabul arsenal are coming to Samasta to instruct (him) Hindustani fanatics in the manu-facture of bombs and cartridges. Two bombs and some cartridges have been sent to fanatics as patterns and the Nawab has obtained possession of one bomb and ten cartridges. From the description, bomb seems to be of the same pattern as those recently thrown in Peshawar.&quot;Following from Waziristan 18th (June ? July): &quot; Some to (two corrupt groups) Khel and Mahsuds of lashkar have again visited Nadir Khan or sent messengers asking for replenishment of ammunition, saying that they had spent all theirs in fighting on 16th July, when as a matter of fact very few shots were fired. Nadir Khan encouraged Madda Khel to harass Government, saying peace was out of the question and that cartridges would be given to all (? who) fired at Tongas or motor-cars or pickets .and specially requested them &apos;to (two- corrupt groups), saying that Khan ,Muhammad Khan had not sufficient force to oppose them.&quot; Madda Khan Maliks have again visited Nadir Khan, asking him whether to commence operations or in the alternative lend them four guns with gunners.&quot;
