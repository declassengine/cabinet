On the same day &quot;BAMM&quot; grounded and was holed amidships off Reval whither sne has heen taken for repairs.On July 8th the German s.s, BABYLON with Esthoman prisoners sailed from Danzig escorted by VANCOUVER. %On July 10th GALATEA with General Gough sailed from Eelsingfors to Riga and thenca to Libau.DELHI (Flag of R.A.) left Biorko for Reval on 9th July and returned on the 10th and thence proceeded to Helsingfors on the 11th and to Biorko on the same day.On July 9th Submarine H.29 grounded at Copenhagen but was refloated next day.On July 10th &quot;TOLSTON and VENDETTA sailed from Copenhagen for Harwich and on July 11th Submarines H.24, 28, 29 and 30 sailed from Copenhagen for Blyth.&apos;   DRAGON and DAUNTLESS have also sailed from Biorko for Copon-hagen and England, - DANAE having relieved Dauntless at Biorko. Part of the Baltic Naval force is at Biorko and the remainder at Reval atd Idbau.    One destroyer has heen maintained at Riga and Windau has heen visited by VCKT1GERN and tXWUL.S.N.0. Baltic reports that mines have been laid by PEIICSSS MARGARET.The situation at Libau is quiet.    S.0. 2nd LoCS. reports that General Gough?s representative  who was sent to arrange the Germanevacuation of Latvia, brought back the reply that the Germans refuse to evacuate Latvia until they consider German interests secure, and in consequence S.0. 2nd L.C.S. states that he does not proposeunder a British Commandant.The situation at Riga is quiet and the population is regaining confidence.      On July 5th all Riga east of the Bvina was clear of Germans and the west bank was also reported to be clear.    The water supply had been repaired and the Ulmanis Lettish Government moved to Riga on July 7th.The Supreme Council of Allied Governments have agreed to the * policy of repatriating Prisoners of ;7ar in Germany.    The number of Esthonians concerned is 2,700 and of Letts 5,300,   No prisoners will be repatriated to these countries except natives, and none are to be sent against their will, and they will not arrive armed as suggested.Tne Admiralty has informed S.ii.O. Baltic that there is no objection to coast bombardments being carried out at his dis-cretion so long as ships can operate in waters &quot;believed free of mines.    Eight 55-feet Coastal Motor Boats are being prepared for ^despatch to the Baltic.
A determined mutiny occurred during the early morning of July 7th on the right hank of the Dwina amongst troops of the Russian British Legion and the National Army,    The mutiny.was suppressed hy action of British officers and gun fire, 4 Russian British Legion Officers being killed and 2 wounded, and 3 British S.B.L. officers killed and 2&apos;wounded.    ihe Mutiny which was due to active propaganda 6ame without any warning and the enemy seized the opportunity to attack the right hank position.    A determined attack by enemy gunboats was countered by our gunboats, monitors and seaplanes, all of whom behaved with great gallantry ana a Naval party was landed to support shore positions.    The situation is now restored by British reinforcements bfought by paddle minesweepers and S*N*0!s steamer.    M.33 was hit ihd&apos;the wardroom demolished, but there v/ere no casualties.  H.M.S, &quot;Cricket&quot; was holed below the waterline but grounded safely, and repairs are in hand.    2 men were wounded by heavy machine gun and rifle fire.    Our seaplanes are of the greatest use and doing most of the aerial work on this front.    The naval transport is very disorganised due to low water.Murmansk9At midnight on July 5th-6th, the village of Kyapelga was captured.   The position was of considerable strength and the enemy were supported by 5 guns.      Without our suffering a singlecasualty the enemy were compelled to evacuate the position leaving1 officer and 49 other ranks with 3 machine guns in our hands.   Thenemy set fire to the village and impeded pursuit.    The capture of Kyapelga gives line with the best lateral communications to be obtained in this area.The enemy are reported to be withdrawing from the Shunga peninsula across the water to Lijma on the railway and also south-ward.    Whilst on reconnaissance on July 8th, a 30-knot Motor Launch procured locally and fitted with 3-pounder guns and 6 maxims for Lake Onega caught fire and sank.    The discipline was splendid though 5 are missing and several others suffering from burns,    A seaplane took part in rescue work.General Myynard reports that apparently the enemy is strongly reinforced, and that a reconnaissance on June 9th captured 11 prisoners of the 1st Odessa Rifle regiment which is new to this front.Reports state that 4 new regiments have just arrived at Petrozavodsk, and it is learnt from prisoners that a counter offen-siTe regard^lrlSln railway troops will not stay as volunteers but are willing to remain if ordered.   Evacuation of these iroops will commence on July 15th as shipping facilities permit.It is reported from Finland that in spite of the chaoticcondition of Russia, the Russian Hydrographical Department has made plans for new expeditions in the sea North of Siberia.    The first under Commander Vilkitski, son of the former explorer of this dis-trict will survey between the White Sea and Cape Tsichebjuskin. and the second under Commander Novapachenni, from Cape Tschebiuskin to the Behring&apos;Straits.    Investigations will last a year and include charting the coasts, soundings and study of ice conditions.call demobilizable men on this station, with the exception of about 300, for whom reliefs are now on their way, have been relieved. , . .   .   ,HAS. &quot;CANADA&quot; with demobilisable ratings, has arrived at Gibraltar, and will discharge the men at Devonport and Portsmouth, being subsequently taken to Rosyth by a navigating party..NOTOM RUSSIA,
The last of the French troops left Corfu on July 6th, &quot;but a few French Naval Authorities are&quot;remaining until the end of.the month to clear up,    Italians are leaving daily, and the Italian GOO left on June 22nd.,    A Colonel remains in charge until the end of July when they expect to leave finally.The British Naval Base is closed,On July 6th and 7th fracas took place &quot;between Italian and French troops at Fiume, in which it is reported that nine Cochin Chinese French Colonials were killed.    An International Commis-sion has been appointed to investigate.B.A., 3rd L.C.S. has been directed to remain at Fiume in HMS &quot;Cardiff&quot; and keep Admiralty fully informed of any further developments.Our position in the dispute is governed by the general instruc-tions regarding the Adriatic situation issued in May to the Naval authorities in the Mediterranean that British ships are on no account to take action, and that ships are to proceed to sea rather than interveneThe Turkish G.0.C 3rd Army Corps at Samsun (General Rafaas) has sent a communication to the British Military Control Officer stating that as British troops had been landed there without the knowledge&apos; or consent of the Central Government, he, declined to accept further responsibility for the maintenance of.order.   He also threatened to resist the despatch, without the consent of the Central Government, of Gurkha&quot; troops to the interior. Admiral Calthorpe immediately ordered the Grand Vizier to recall this officer to Constantinople and a destroyer is being sent to Samsun with orders from the Turkish Government to this effect. If they are not obeyed, the Turkish G.O.C. will be declared an outlaw-Mudros and Constantinople are constituted Intelligence Centres for the time being, and pending further instructions, H.M. Ships and Naval Authorities in the Aegean and Black Seas will report movements of foreign men-of-war only to the Captain of Base, Mudros, and Captain of Base, Constantinople, who will be responsi-ble for passing on the information to the Admiralty and other authorities concerned.BMiULSM.From information recently received from Nicolaieff it appears that there is very little likelihood of the Bolsheviks being able to send submarines to the Black Sea.    The town was recently in the occupation of Gregorieff and is now occupied by an inconsiderable Bolshevik garrison.    No work is going.on in the dockyard and of 2 submarines reported ready, it is how stated that only one is in the water and that she lacks several important parts.     The submarine personnel are at present employed in police duties in the town.       This submarine was required to carry out. an attack on French patrol craft at Ochakov.A portion of the French 12th Colonial&apos;Regiment has arrived at Varna to relieve the Italians.   This has come&apos;as an unpleasant surprise to the Bulgarians, who have fraternised freely with the Ital ians, but dislike the French,       There are vague rumours of Bulgarian activity in the Dobrudja.. CASPIANOur S;uadron has been employed in convoying Russian ships, presumably carrying troops, to the attack on Astrakhan.     The -operations against Astrakhan are progressing comparatively well,though
Blockade.-The Blockade against Germany was raised on the 12th inst. and the fishing restrictions were removed at the same time, German ships trading will still remain under the control of the Allied Naval Armistice Commission.Gorman Mercantile Marine.-4 additional Pood Ships have been surrendered during the week, and the numbers which have now arrived are;-For British 164 cut of 252French 67            98lLS,Ao 11            60Belgians    ____1 ,jr.m      .4iQ/ though the Volunteer Army to the South+West of Astrakhan has been held up &quot;by a landing of Bed troops in that area.It is reported that 70 Red barges armed with bomb.throwers and machine guns are cruising in neighbourhood and that 600 sailors have landed in the region of Dosadinskbe.The last report of the Bed Fleet was. to the effect that they were in the Volga,    It is considered improbable that there will be another naval aotion0E.A. Black sea reports that the Bolsheviks are sending i   reinforcements and making every effort to hold Astrakhan until the Italians take over the Caspian.The war Office has postponed evacuation until August 15th, but the Admiralty are insisting on the withdrawal of the Naval forces from the Caspian before the military,    The R.A, Black Sea and the C-in-G hold a strong opinion that until Astrakhan falls, British troops must remain i a Baku, and the Caucasus to secure the position of the Navy.The Italian Commando Supremo states that owing to the failure of the British Government to supply shipping, the ship-ment of Italian troops for the Caucasus is delayed indefinitely.CHI N AH.M.S. &quot;Carlisle&quot; has arrived at Vladivostock, and has been engaged in assisting the evacuation of American troops at America Bayn    The reliefs for demobilisable men on this station are leaving in H.M.S. &quot;COLOMBO&quot; on the 16th July.    &quot;Colombo&quot; has been directed to proceed to Shanghai, at which place she should arrive on the 27tn August, and, after relieving ratings at that place, will return to England, calling at Hong Kong and Singapore.EASJLIIIOS ;KoMeSa &quot;Colombo&quot;, carrying reliefs for this station leaves Shanghai about the 29th August, and will call at Colombo, Bombay, , and Aden, as well as a port in the Persian Gulf to effect reliefs,HcMoSc &quot;Cambrian&quot; has left the Azores for Trinidad, to relieve H.M.S. &quot;Dartmouth&quot; which ship will then proceed to the South American Station.
Banal Inter-Allied Ooffliaission of Control. a ^   .  .The organisation etc. of the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control was discussed at Versailles on the 7th July, and&apos; the proposals were approved by the Supreme iTar Council on the 9th inst., I R. A H Q ,B.A ministerial circular has been issued giving the provisional composition and reorganisation of the Fleet.    It provides for a fairly ambitious programme, and it is expected that the agitation for economy which&apos; is at present so marked in France, will&apos;have the effect of modifying this&apos; organisation within a short time.A special section is composed of the Battleship PROVENCE (fleet flag ship) and the cruiser JIMEN-DE-LA-GRAV1ERE.1st Squadron, Western Mediterranean, with full crews, will comprise the battleship COHRBET (flag ship), JEAN-BART, PARIS, LORRAINE (flag of Rear-Admiral), FRANCE and BRETAGNE.
