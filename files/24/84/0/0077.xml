BMORAIP)UJh .QM PBHSIOIfo PROPOSALS. Just &quot;before tlio last election the Government promised to set.4up a Select Committee to consider and report upon the grievances of disabled men and the widows and dependants of those killed in War.The Select Committee was set up in April last and is now about to make an interim report.Immediate action on the report could probably not be avoidedexistingon account of the adute feeling,/as to the inadequacy of the present pensions and the endorsement recently given by Sir Douglas Haig to the demands for increase but action is rendered more urgent because the Pensions estimates have to be discussed in the House of Commons on Wednesday next, and cannot be postponed as the vote will then be exhausted,I therefore bring before the Cabinet the proposals which I understand the L-elect Committee are&quot;&apos;.making with an estimate of cost, in advance of the actual report so as to give time for consideration, iMBNTST.PMSIONp,,   at 100^. disability, lesser disabilities in proportion.* ,;(a) FlaJjJ^ate^Present Kate,Single Man 33/- a weekMarried with wifebut no children       33/-      &quot;ditto with 1 child   41/-      &quot;&quot; &quot; 3 children 47/-   &quot;with 5/- extra for each additional child under 16 years oldProposed Rate; 40/- a 776ekIT50/-57/6 63/6with 6/- extra for each additional ch:&quot;.ld under 16 years old,(If
2.(b) Alternative Pensions.the  Select Committee proposes to add 60$ to the aotual pre-war earnings of a man claiming alternative pension with a maximum of  5 and to grant him a pension on that basis less the actual earnings of which he is now capable.It is expected that about lt%&apos; of the men pensioned will be . entitled to alternative pension.

there will bo an additional charge during tho nest year or so for temporary pensions.If tie Be proposals are put into operation for six months of this year,  is,OOO,000 should be added to the estimates of tho ye ar.OBSERVATION.Unemployed pay - Treatment and draining Allowances. At present men disabled 90$ and less are entitled to draw unemployed pay and children1s allowances in addition to their pensions and children1 s. allowances.     Thus, a man 90/- disabled if out of worlr, may draw in pension and unemployed pay 87/6 a week,A saving would be effected in some cases if a partially disabled man when unemployed under treatment or under training and thus deprived of his earning capacity were treatod as to tally dis able d.. If the proposed rates are adopted, a 90,  disabled man would thon draw on the new rates 69/6 instead of 87/6, a 50$ disabled man would draw 69/6 instead of 67/-. ^Statutory right to Pensions&quot;. Indo;pendent^Ap-.;eal tribunals .One of the claims most persistently put forward by the Association of Disoharged Men is the claim to a pension by Statute and not by Warrant or Order in Council.There are many administrative difficulties in the way of    -giving a full statutory right with povrer to enforce the pension claim in tho Law Courts.To meet the claim in part Appeal Tribunals have been set up, and if a claim for pension is refused on the ground et non-entitlement, the case goes before an Appeal Tribunal.Mr.
SUBMISSION.In the circumstances I thin.1: the Government cannot refuse to adopt the Select Committee1 s report if it does net r;c further then the outline I have given.     I therefore ask for authority to announce its acceptance (with the consequential alterations I have noted) with a proviso that after 5 years the rates will be reconsidered and moved up or down as may be necessary in accordance with, any variation which may take place in the cost of living.Mr. Sonar Law promised the House of Commons that such a decision should be final.    Constitutionally the Minister is responsible and cannot delogato a final decision;   moreover it is urged by the Disabled lien18 Associations that, as &quot;the Minister appoints the ri:ribunal&amp; they aro not in dependant.I propose that the Tribunals should be set up by Act of Parliament and that the Lord Chancellor should make the appointments and have power to make rules of proeodure-I believe this will meet the presont pressure, and if later the administrative difficulties can be removed a further extension of the right of appeal might be, granted.Officers1 and Officers1 V&apos;idowsT Pensions.It is understood that no recommendation is to be ma*\e by the Committee in their interim report ior any increase in officers1 and their widows1 pensions, but it must be pointed out that if 60$ is to be added as I think it should be to the pre-war earnings of men to compensate for the fall in the value of money, the same course must be followed for the alternative pensions of officers and their widows, and also in assessing dependency and elsewhere when pre-war income is taken into account.Subject to this, which is relatively a minor matter, I do net expect that there vail be any-demand for an increase in officers1 etc., pensions.
-5-2i I also ask authority to say that it is the intention ofthe Government to introduce a Bill ta set up the Appeal (Tribunals independent of the Ministry of Pensions and that their decision as to entitlement (not amounts) shall be treated as final.3. I also ask authority to state that as regards partiallydisabled men thoir pensions and allowances shall be made in to the full rate by the Ministry of Pensions during treatment and by the Ministry of Labour during unemployment or training.L.W.E.22/7/IS.MiNiSTBY   OF   PENSIONS
