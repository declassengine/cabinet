THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PflOmftTY 03?,HIS HglTAMIC MAJESOT GOVT^,,War cabinet. 338SECRET, Copy of lettor received by lie.Barnes from Arch-g.t.7798    angel, July 15th 1919.Dear Mr.Barnes,V/e are living here in a state of grave anxiety I am writing to you to ask if anything can be done to relieve it.     To us here it seems evident that England has at least as great an obligation to defend the Northern Territory of Russia as she had to defend Belgium.   For a year we have fed the pop-ulation, financed the^Government, trained, equipped and led the army.   We are not popular&quot;: the people are not grateful.   But they rely on us:   I think they trust us.   If we withdraw our army, theirs will not stand.   The Territory, whioh today is or-derly and prosperous v-jin be reannexed to Soviet Rus ia.   Those who can leave will leav . with us; the rest will be left to the good faith and humanity of the Bolshevists, excited by a victory over England; and by the prospect of vast stores of food.If,, by evacuating, we left the Territory in no worse plight than the rest of Russuaa, even so we should have made a bad end of a year&apos;s work.   If you add the reprisals that are humanly inevitable, the persecution of itotiateascfc individuals and ola-^ses which seem beyond doubt to go with the Soviet regime everywhere, then the prospect is worse.   And what will, I should anticipate, make the reality even more miserable is the fact that Archangel being Kolchai^s best line of communication with the outside world, the Bolsheviks are bound to do their utmost, by . any means, to master the territory and make themselves secure in it.   They cannot afford to leave a loophole for our return or for a rising.At the same time, the case for evacuation is strong.. It is evident that we cannot rely on our own army, unless the men are satisfied with the cause that brings them here, and for which they are asked to sacrifice themselves.   It is evident that we cannot rely on public opinion at home to send troops or keep troops here unless publio opinion is satisfied too.Sitting here in Archangel, we see the question of evacuation as a plain Issue of humanity, which has nothing what--ever to do with the question of our policy in Russia but which is becoming blended with it. It is for that reason that we are anx-ious.   If the truth abour Archangel were told to the country (and believed) I cannot imagine there would be any hesitation to undertake its defence.   But if the truth were told would it be believed?   The argument I imagine on the other side would run somehow thus:-&quot;You want me to fight for a Russian Ulster:   you know you cannot separate defence from attack, that if you stay in North Russia, you must attack the Bolsheviks and in any case your mere presence addds to &quot;Kolohafs. power by relieving him from all araxiety as to his western base; we are not satisfied that we ought to be on the same side as Kolchak, and if you are so much concerned about your friends in the North who you say after a year of your occupation&apos;are still unfit to defend themselves, we take that as a proof that your right course is to deal direct with moscow and/
and make with the Soviet an agreenwirt&apos;Tmdarnirtiioh the Worth will be at least safe from the Red Terrorwhich we do not believe to be very different from theWhite Terror of-your Siberian frionds.&quot;This so far as 1 can judge from the papers is the attitude of a large section both in the army and among; civilians.   The danger of it comes from the fact that this section can cause trouble.   My own opinion is that for a reason which has nothing to do&apos;with Kolchak or Archangel this trouble must be faced and beaten.The reason is this. The great conflict set on foot by the Russian Resolution is not between labour and Capital but between tho idea of political life expressed by the House of Commons and the idea expressed by Doviets.   I have no doubt that the Soviet system has a great deal of good in it tot we ought to blend into our own House of Commons system.    But for this deea&amp;e or generation they are as incompatible as Catholicism and Protestantism or King and Parliament were once.  And surely it is better to face thiB incompatibility even while looking out for point for future adjustment than to run away from it,I am afraia this is a very long letter; but I have tried to put the conclusions of two years1 observation of Russia and England in$o one envelope.    And, as it seems to me, the sum of the whole matter is this.   If we leave North Russia, it will-be because on a question whera all the morality was on one side, the Soviet has encountered the House of Commons and beaten it.2,Whitehall Gardens, 25th July 1919,
