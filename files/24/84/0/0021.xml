SURRENDER OP GERMANS WHO VIOLATED LAWS AND CUSTOMS OP WAR.Admiralty Memorandum for &quot;the. War CabinetThe Admiralty view with some apprehension the state of affairs as regards those German persons required to be surrendered for violating the laws and customs of war.      It is observed that in the Protocol supplementary to the Peaco Treaty signed at Versailles on the 28th June, 1919, Paragraph 3 requires that the list of persons to bo handed over to the Allied and Associated Governments by Germany under the second paragraph of Article 228 shall be communicated to the German Government within one month from the ooming into force of the Treaty.It is thought that if this arrangement, is carried out as it stands that the probabilities are that none of those persons required will be forthconrbag, since they will have ample time and opportunity for escaping from Germany^The Admiralty have information that if such were to occur, there would be a public outcry, and since a large proportion of these persons are to be proseouted for maritime offences I bring this matter to the notice of my colleagues..(Signed.)   W.H. Long.16. 7. 19,
