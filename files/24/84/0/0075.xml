*SECRET.Ii3 rjritinn^ MajesVs O^varnmMINISTRY  OF  FOOD.port for Month ending 15th July 1919.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.. In answer to a question in the House of Commons on July 14th the Food Controller made the following announcement with regard to the position of the Ministry of Food: 1 The Government have decided that the Ministry of Food shall continue for the present with full powers. - I am accordingly making arrangements to regulate during the coming winter supplies, prices, and distribution of essential foodstuffs, either by Statutory Order or by arrangement with the trades concerned. The articles so controlled will comprise bread, meat, bacon, milk, cheese, butter, margarine, fish, eggs, and certain subsidiary foods of which there may be an actual or prospective shortage. It will not, I hope, be necessary to restrict consumption by a revival of the coupon system, but it is : , : already becoming difficult in some instances to adjust available supplies to a demand which has increased irrespective of price.;% \- On the following day the Food Controller addressed a meeting representative of the Press and after reviewing the situation in its effect on the various staple articles of food, he concluded with the following epitome of his views : So far as supplies were concerned he looked forward to the Coming winter with a feeling, if not of assurance, at any rate of optimism.   As regards .   prices, it was different.   Although he was not as pessimistic as many people on this score, at the same time it would certainly require a great effort to prevent prices from rising beyond what they were last winter.   As regards this question of prices, he would say that it was not the profiteer alone who was the cause of high prices to-day.   If they only had to contend with the profiteer the situation would be much simpler than it was.   They could control the profiteer, but they could not control the world situation which had arisen ...  as a result of the war.   As he saw it, that situation was this : the energies of the entire world had been devoted during the past 41 years to one central -,.    task, that of destruction destruction of life, of material, of treasure.   Go r   -   where they would, they would find this tale of destruction pursuing them. They would see it in finance, in the inflated state of the currency, in the ... unfavourable foreign exchange, and in our enormous indebtedness.  In the: -V    face of this situation there was only one thing which could possibly affect high prices, and that was increased production.On the same occasion. Lord Cunliffe dealt with the financial position, with, particular reference to the inflation of currency and the adverse position of foreign exchanges. - &apos; -The decision to maintain various measures of food control over the winter has led to a general reversal of the policy applied throughout the early months of&apos; the year and not only will it be necessary to cancel the arrangements made for the demobilisation of the Ministry and the dispersal of the staff, but it will also be imperative to re-establish such branches as may be required to carry out the new policy. The staff required will depend on the degree of control exercised in respect of the various commodities.At. present the Ministry exercises control in four ways; firstly, assurance of-&quot; supply; secondly, distribution; thirdly, control -of prices; and fourthly, control of consumption. The degree of control varies in different foods; thus, control under the Jour heads is exercised in the case of sugar, meat, andftbutter ; control under the three heads of assurance of supply, distribution, and price, m the case of cereals and cheese; while control of prices alone is exercised in respect of at least 90 per cent, of the principal foodstuffs. To what extent and in what manner it will be necessary to re-impose these various methods of-control upon the articles as regardsa  (33)8532       16  150  7/19   e&amp;s a
t,2 &apos; &quot;MMMwhich control has been relaxed, is now under consideration and in each case the primary test will be the question of prices, ...It will be apparent that the demand for staff will depend wholly on the degree to which control is exercised and that while the assurance of supplies in itself would not necessitate a largely increased establishment, the necessity of extending control to include the other three heads would involve recruitment on a considerable scale., The question of staff isone-of ^extreme importance and- further reference is made to it later in this Report.Meat. It will be impossible to abandon the control of meat and live stock on September 30th, as was originally intended. As a result of the recent drought home-produced meat has recently been in. short supply, and, though an early improvement is anticipated, the fact that cattle have suffered as the result of the shortage of concentrated feeding stuffs will keep, the yield of home-produced meat below: the normal. Owing to the uncertainty as to tonnage, there, is no assurance that private traders would be able to provide the full quota of meat from. South America, and it has .accordingly, been decided that the Argentine meat should be purchased by the Government.;. With adequate tonnage the supplies from this source, together with the Australasian meat, are calculated to be sufficient to make the country independent of - the North American supplies. It is proposed that the Argentine.purchases should cover not only our civilian requirements but also those of the Army Council and the French Government, and under this scheme all contracts will be made, together. It will be arranged, however, that the Food Controller will be responsible for the civilian purchases which will be made in his name. .v.&apos;As from.June 23rd maximum retail prices for veal-were re-imposed on the same scale as was in force prior to May 31st; This course was rendered necessary by the sudden rise.of the price of uncontrolled veal to 3s. M. per lb., which led to the undue slaughter of calves, and thus threatened to cause the serious depletion of the national herds. The Board of Agriculture concurred in the decision to re-introduce the control; of calves and veal.       ,. , -,      . :. Bacon.-The Bacon and Ham (Prices) Order, 1919, imposed a maximum retail prices for bacon but left free the prices chargeable by the producers and distributors, with the result that the rising; prices&apos;in the United States led.to a serious curtailment of the retailers&apos;, margin of profit.In- order to meet this difficulty the flat retail price of -,2s. Ad. per lb. has been replaced by a schedule of. prices under which the. maximum price is raised to 2s. Qd. per lb. for the best cuts, with maximum: prices running down to Is. id. for inferior cuts.; The advisability of resuming full control of bacon has been discussed and as this would involve Government purchase, the Ministry has taken steps to ascertain the&apos; attitude of H.M. Treasury on the matter. In the course of conversations H.M. Treasury has intimated that in general it cannot sanction the resumption of Government purchase unless the article ini question is rationed to the consumer.. In view of the Cabinet decision that the Ministry should continue with full powers to trade, the Food Controller is unable to accept the claim of the Treasury to. impose conditions on his trading proposals,&apos; and he has accordingly addressed a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject. ; :      !..-&apos;.-.: The price of hogs in America is steadily rising and there has been a sharp fall in the dollar exchange. It is anticipated therefore that there, will be an immediate increase in the first hand prioe of both American and Canadian bacon.Fish. Fish,is considerably cheaper thanitwasa year ago^and a further reduction&apos; in prices is to .be expected.  It would appear, however, that retailers are sometimes reluctant to adjust their prices to the public in sympathy with a fall in the wholesale market.   Supplies have been somewhat irregular with occasional gluts and this has-&apos;  increased the difficulties of transport..... . ;   .        . :! V,;5i Should;the demand for fish be stimulated by a shortage in other foodstuffs, such, as meat and bacon, it will probably be necessary to reimpose a drastic schedule of&apos; prices. hm ill kti&apos;;&apos;$&amp;j : :&apos; si -    .&apos; - ti ; Owing.to the increase in the&apos;cost of production of milk resulting from;Bie; prolonged drought&apos;in May and June, the maximum price of milk produced in. :Engl&apos;ahd and;Wales&quot;has&quot;been increased hj14(1&apos;.&apos;per gallon,&apos;for the month of July.&apos; The increase/ does not apply to. Scotland &quot;and; in cases where milk is exported from Scotland to&quot; England or Wales during July, ,the purchaser is licensed and required to pay to the Ministry id. per gallon on milk purchased from Scotland.   This
arrangement is similar to &apos; those already &quot;applicable (in the areas of England where differential prices are in force. Up to July 15th the sum accruing ^unde^ [those various arrangements is&apos; approximately 150,000Z.1! ( ,  .        lVPreliminary steps have been taken to secure the setting ;;up of th.e Inter-Departnienta], Committee of the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Health, the Board of Agriculture, and the Scottish Office to agree upon the legal and administrative measures necessary to give effect to the decision of the. Cabinet;that the following powers should he made permanent, viz.:;  . , , (, ...    &apos;,To fix maximum prices in case of need. . - -    /,        , To,regulate distribution in times of shortisupply. To license all dealers in milk.To grade milk. ... . ;i. .To empower Local Authorities to undertake the supply of milk; within their areas.To control the use of milk for the manufacture of milk products.&apos; : Better.-The sanction of H.M. Treasury has been obtained for the purchase of 4;0G0 tons of Canadian butter, while 5,000 tons have been bought in Denmark. The, Siberian supply, however, is not likely to become available and with, a general shortage it may be necessary to reduce the weekly ration of 2 ozs, for some part of the winter at least.Oils and Fats. A considerable number of allied trades concerned in this industry have been, formed into; separate associations, and a system of supervision has been instituted for the following purposes:  ;       m ;v(1) To restrict dealings to firms or persons licensed by the Ministry. This has been effected by Statutory Order . containing a schedule of restricted 1 -; commodities. Originally, the schedule merely included directly edible oils, but, at the request of the linoleum manufacturers, linseed and linseed V oil were added to the list. The soap makers desired that their oils should also be added, but the Committee of Chairmen of the various associations have turned this proposal down. It is now proposed to add all cakes and meals at the request of the cattle-feeding stuff traders. The Order has worked well; apart from giving satisfaction to the trades it has succeeded in checking prices in all instances, and in one or two has caused them to be slightly lowered. . girls&apos; .,(2) To assist the private importers in obtaining shipping for their purchases. The Shipping Controller has stated that he anticipates no difficulty -in supplying freight for all our requirements.       ...        u (3) To regulate the arrangements with the trade for the price of manufactured :iproducts in all stages of distributioni  This action has worked well, as &apos; notwithstanding the fact that raw materials&apos; are double their pre-sup.eryisipn1 &apos; ; &apos; - &quot; value, the price of margarine has barely&apos; risen. The^Laboifr. Statistics figures say that it has risen \\d. a pound, but in point of fact 60 per cent, of the total margarine-is sold in this country at Is., while Dutch margarine is now being sold at lid. It is only the small makers who sell at the ; ; , * price of Is, 2d. It has, moreover, been arranged that the maximurn price of 85 per cent, of manufactured margarine for the next four months shall not exceed Is. 2d., There is, consequently; little fear of an increase in the price of margarine.  . .       ,      \i !   , -      . mThe distribution arrangements are working well&apos;as the large, traders have, now &quot;&quot;expressed their willingness to send any quantity of margarine on our demand to any -district orindividuai trader where supplies are ascertained to be short.      1DriedI Frmts-Whe - dried fruit trade is. seasonal and * buying commences in , August. The forecasts of supplies are not encouraging. The crop of Greek currants is reported to be below the average while Turkish sultanas,.and.Spanish.raisins have done badly. In face of the reduced supply there will be a heavy demand and the Ministry is advised that on a free market the retail price of sultanas would rise frorn Is. to 3s. per lb. and that other dried fruits would show .aj similar adyance. It would be ineffectual to attempt to govern the situation by means of a maximum retail price as this would not only allow the producers and wholesalers to exploit the retailer hut would also leave manufacturers and caterers, free, to buy at their own figures, which could be covered by increased charges for cakes, &amp;c.  Further it is agreed that theA 2
1;. International Food Control.-At the meeting held on 28th June, the Council of .the Principal.Allied and Associated Powers decided as follows :-&quot; That in some form international consultation in economic matters should - v be continued until the Council of the League of Nations has had an opportunity &quot; of considering the present acute position of the economic situation, and that &apos;        the Supreme Economic Council should  be requested to suggest, for the consideration of the several Governments, the methods of consultation which would be most serviceable for this purpose.&quot;The Sub-Committee of the Supreme Economic Council which was appointed to report upon the means of carrying into effect the above decision has made the following recommendations:         ;, (1) An International Economic Council shall be. formed to consult together on economic matters and to advise the various Governments concerned, pending the organisation of the League of Nations.   On the termination :.       of the Supreme Economic Council, the Inter-Allied Organisations then , -&apos;. existing which have been previously responsible to.the Supreme. economic council shall report to the International Economic Council.&apos;     r&quot;.fixing of all prices from the importer to the retailer would probably endanger supplies. In the circumstances it has been decided that in the case of dried fruits the general control of supply, distribution and prices should, be re-imposed, and that purchases should be made through the importers in England on a rebate system which worked successfully during the previous period of control.Fruit for Jam. The position of the jam manufacturers has been reviewed and the following decisions have been taken : ;    (1) That no order should be issued as&apos; to the price of raspberries and other soft fruit to jam manufacturers.(2) That, in view of the risk of panic buying on the part of manufacturers and a -     .  consequent rise in price, maximum prices for stone fruit sold to jammanufacturers should be fixed in agreement. with the Departments of.Agriculture,.Sugar. The position of the sugar supply is becoming.difficult. The demand in the world&apos;s market is so heavy that prices have been obtained in the producing countries, which, if they become general, would necessitate the increase of the retailed price in the United Kingdom by i\d. per lb. These very high prices may not be maintained, but, it is certain that the further purchases of sugar required in order to ensure supplies up to March 31st, 1920, will be made at prices considerably above the level of the present contracts. The Royal Commission on Sugar Supplies has expressed some anxiety, as. to the supplies for the winter and it may become necessary to reduce the individual weekly ration from. 12 ozs. to 8 ozs. This step would be taken with reluct-ance and, with a view to avoiding it, if possible, every effort will be made to economise supplies by a strict supervision of manufacturers&apos; demands and retailers&apos; permits.&apos; Tea.-Jn spite of the large supplies available, higher prices have been realised at public auctions of tea during the - past month. There has been an increased demand due largely,to increased consumption and in a lesser degree to the building up of retailers&apos; stocks.The reduction of the duty on Indian and Ceylon teas by 2d. per lb. has so far prevented the rise in the wholesale price of tea from being reflected in the retail price, but it is anticipated that in the near future there will be a rise in the average retail price of tea.Spirits and Beer-The Food Controller has circulated a Memorandum to the War Cabinet reporting the result of his investigations into the scarcity of supplies of whisky.A new Beer (Prices) Order has been introduced in order to adjust prices in accordance with the Cabinet ruling that; the sum of 13,000,0001., released by the recent removal of restrictions on output, instead of being absorbed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should enure to the benefit of the consumer by way of an improvement in the quality of beer.
.. - (2) The membership of: the International Economic Council shall comprise two ;            delegates of Ministerial or High Commissioner^ rank from each of the ..   . , , 1 nations represented on the Supreme Economic Council, viz.:  , ; United States of America,,      , British Empire,,.....;  France,h&amp; ki\ &apos;M ;Italy, .&apos;:\: :: \  ;.;     ; \ , ]\: /.: i &apos;i8-Belgium,(( with the addition of one delegate, each of the same rank from four other....: Governments to be invited by the International Economic Council.&apos;,; (3) The Council may in its discretion invite a representative of any other country - to sit as a member at any meeting of the Council during the consideration of matters specially affecting the interests of that country.(4) The Council shail normally meet once a month in London, Paris, Washington, Brussels or Rome, according as the Council may decide. -(5) The Council shall have full authority to create the necessary organisation and machinery to canyon its work.(6) The first meeting of the Council shall be held on or before the 9th August, at such place as may be determined by the Governments represented on the Supreme Economic Council.These recommendations have been accepted in principle by the Supreme Economic Council and referred to the various Governments for consideration along with a proposal that the first Session of the International Economic Council should be held at Washington.Financial Statement for the year ending 31st March 1919.-A Provisional Trading Account for the year to 31st March 1919 has been prepared in accordance with the undertaking given hj Lord Crawford to lay such a statement upon the table of the House of Lords. It will be accompanied by a Provisional Summary of Trading and an Explanatory Report.; ; .The. Provisional Trading Account must be considered as approximate, it being impossible at this early stage to give complete and final figures for the reasons stated in the Report.The reserve of T 1,500,0002. against anticipated liabilities and losses on realisation of assets, which is, of necessity, no more than an approximate estimate based upon actual experience up.to date and present indications, includes provision for the following main items ::     : ,:        (a) Loss on transactions in meat. ..(b) Loss on realisation of stocks of potatoes.(c). Claims expected to arise in respect of compensation guaranteed to cheese^ makers.. ./ ;..   ,f . ^(d) Loss in connection with milk control.......  .&apos; (e) Loss in connection with whale oil. .      ..-i        (/) Loss on realisation of plant and buildings.The net surplus of 1,850,0282. will be available to cover any further contingencies which may arise.The Explanatory Report contains the following comments&quot;:-The period of the account is the first complete year of the trading in foodstuffs,&quot; and reflects the policy deliberately adopted of controlling supplies and distribution from the source in order effectively to control prices. This was supplemented by efforts in the &quot;autumn of .1918 to accumulate stocks against the shortage resulting from the enemy submarine campaign., /With the object of steadying any violent fluctuations in the world&apos;s market, selling prices were fixed not only to cover administrative expenses, but also to build up financial reserves for use in an emergency, and to&apos; meet the inevitable decline in value during the period of liquidation. The elimination of war risks at sea has freed the balance of 6,002,0131. to the credit of the fc &quot; Insurance &quot;account, which lias been added to the gross surplus of &apos;7,348,0152.* to provide for anticipated liabilities arising from various commitments enteredinto by the Ministry, and against losses likely to occur in the realisation of stocks and; other assets,- which would; otherwise involve a loss to the national -   -Exchequer,, principally in connection with meat, potatoes, milk, and the manufacture of cheese.    ,   :   , .A 3
If a general fall in prices had occurred immediately following the armistice to the extent that was originally anticipated, there would have remained a very small margin as a net surplus, but the demands of Central Europe have tended to maintain prices nearer the war level, and the value of stocks has not been appreciably diminished. The,margin of 1,850,028 . equal to about a half of one per cent, on the turnover, therefore remains in hand as a reserve for contingencies and costs of final liquidation which cannot at the present date be estimated with any reliability.The statutory accounts of the Ministry of Food are rendered to the Treasury about the 15th of January, after examination by the Comptroller and . Auditor-General, and then presented to Parliament.   The statement given herein does not purport to be an Account and has not been submitted for audit.Dr.Ministry of Food.

The Food Council have had under consideration a memorandum from the Establishment Division dealing with the serious wastage which is being caused in the staff, more particularly among business men and seconded civil servants, by the uncertainty of tenure which attaches to positions in &quot;this&apos; department. They have decided to put before the Treasury certain proposals designed to relieve the Ministry of some of the disabilities to which as a temporary department.it is subject, and to secure for all officers who are considered indispensable some assurance that they shall not lose to any considerable extent by remaining with, the Ministry for so long as their services are required.    . :.       : &apos;.; -Ships&apos; Stoves.-The control of supply for ships&apos; stores ceased with the raising of the blockade.

The -Food Control. Committee for Ireland (Transfer pf Powers&apos;);.Order dated&apos; 17th June 1919, transfers the powers o  the Food Control Committee for Ireland to&apos;
the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland as from the 21st June 1919.The Seeds, Oils and Fats Order, 1919, dated 19th June 1919, forbids all dealings except, under licence issued by the Food Controller, in certain specified oils, seeds and nuts.The Milk (Summer Prices) Amendment Order, 1919, dated 25th June 1919, increases the maximum prices permitted for the sale of milk during the. month of July.The Order dated&apos;25th June 1919, amending the Spirits (Prices and Description) Order,&apos; 1919, increases the maximum prices permitted in certain cases.The Order dated 5th July 1919, amending the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917, reduces the maximum prices of imported beef, mutton and lamb.The Notice dated 5th July 191.9, under the Meat Ketail Prices (England and Wales) Order No. 2, .1918, and the Meat Retail Prices (Scotland) Order, 1918, reduces the maximum retail prices of imported meat.The General Licence dated 9th July 1919, under Jam Prices No. 2 Order, 1918, - fixes the prices for jelly at \d. per lb. above jam prices of same denomination.The Notice dated 10th July 1919, under the British Cheese Order, 1917, sets up a new schedule of maximum lirst-hand prices for cheese manufactured in United Kingdom, other than Cterphilly.The Order dated 10th July 1919, amending the Bacon and Ham (Prices) Order, 1919, varies the price for certain cuts of bacon and ham.The Order dated 12th July 1919, amending the Beer (Prices and Description) Order, 1919, raises the minimum and maximum gravity of beer in each category set out in the schedule 4 degrees and provides that any beer under 1,020 degrees original gravity may only be sold at 2d. per pint in a public bar, where it was 3d. before.The Notice dated 19th June 1919, re-imposes the control of veal as. from the -22nd June 1919, under the Meat Retail Prices (England and Wales) Order No. 2, 1918, and the Meat Retail Prices (Scotland) Order 1918, cancelling the revocation dated 29th May 1919.Enforcement of Orders.. The. total number of prosecutions during the four weeks ending June 28th was 2,194, of which 90 &quot;3 per cent, was successful.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.... &apos; &apos;    Stocks.With the weekly rate of arrivals of. wheat and flour above the average for the year, and deliveries from mills at a lower level during June, the decrease in the stocks of wheat in the United Kingdom (92,000 tons) was again less than that which occurred in the preceding month, but it was still over three times the corresponding-decrease a year ago. The fall in the stocks of other cereals (184,000 tons) was almost entirely due to a drop of 144,000 tons in oats, which is considerably greater than the normal seasonal decrease, but still leaves the quantity of oats in the country double that of a-year ago. Stocks of wheat on 1st July represent nine weeks&apos; supply, or almost exactly our requirements till the end of the cereal year. Of the total stocks of-wheat and flour within the country, inclusive of estimated stocks still on farms and those in millers&apos; and bakers&apos; hands, 47 per cent, was returned as held by-the-Ministry. - .Of the stocks of meat and provisions in cold stores and importers&apos; warehouses on 1st June,and 1st July, those of refrigerated. meat fell sharply by about 20,000 tons owing to the heavy demand caused by the shortage of home supplies, and a low rate of import. Stocks remaining on 1st July represented about 2 weeks total requirements of butchersmeat, but more than half of the total was held on behalf of the War Office. Stocks of canned meat remained high at 33,400 tons,, or approximately a pre-war year&apos;s. supply. Bacon and hams fell by 3,500. tons, and stocks now represent; only 2\ weeks&apos; supply. With the increase.of free imports, the proportion held by the Ministry has fallen to .12 per cent. Stocks of butter continued the upward movement of recent months but at a much slower rate, while those of cheese showed a relapse of 1,400 tons from the relatively high figures of a month before. In spite of larger arrivals) the full in the stocks of lard was little less than in the preceding month, arid represented a further loss of nearly a week&apos;s supply.a i
Stocks of sugar rose by 57,000 tons, making an improvement of about 100,000 tons on the position.of a year ago. In the case of tea, coffee and cocoa, there were further additions to quantities already exceptionally large.Imports.The weekly rate of imports of the principal foods and feeding stuffs during June (214,500 tons) showed a slight decrease on the rate for May (219,200 tons), but was still considerably above the average for the year (173.100 tons). Arrivals of wheat and other cereals followed the movement of the total, being about 3 per cent, below the weekly rate for May. Weekly imports of refrigerated meat were, at 10,500 tons, only half those of May, and, in view of the low seasonal home supplies, represented, a deficit of about 33 per cent, on current requirements of imported meat. Arrivals of bacon improved during the month, and the weekly average of 12,100 tons marked a slight gain on current requirements. This applies also to lard, when the weekly quantity of 3,500 tons compares with an average of 1,800 for the year to date. There was again, a good import of sugar, the total net imports for,the month (202,000 tons) being considerably above the corresponding arrivals of recent years, and even of pre-war years. Weekly arrivals of tea (5,700 tons) and Cocoa (3,74-0 tons) were both nearly double the pre-war rate, and those of coffee (1,370 tons), though they marked a sharp decrease on the figures of the preceding month, were still up to the average of the first half of the year, during which period total arrivals of coffee at 35,900 tons have represented about a year and a half&apos;s supply, even at the highest rate of consumption reached during the war. &apos; rt- Consumption. ,  \ : \Butcher s Meat, There was a remarkable movement in the home-grown supplies of butcher&apos;s meat in Great Britain during June. After the large supplies forthcoming in May a certain shortage in June was to be anticipated, but. this was aggravated by the effects of the drought. In the first week of the month home supplies were little over 11,000 tons. The last two weeks, however, saw a very rapid increase to 16,500 tons and 20,500 tons respectively, as farmers made an effort to clear off stock before the descending scale of prices began to operate! on 1st July. Owing to local shortages of stocks ami difficulties of transport, issues of refrigerated.meat failed to&apos;redress the shortage of home supplies in the early weeks of tho mouth, and in certain industrial areas there was a considerable shortage in total supplies. The estimated average weekly consumption for June by civilians in Great Britain was 25,000 tons, of which 11,000 tons Avere imported meat. This compares with a weekly, rate. of 17,000 tons a year ago, of which 8,000 tons were imported, meat, and with &quot;a weekly rate of 27,000 tons for June 1916, when the imported meat included was only 5,500 tons.&apos; Fiour.--Deliveries of flour from mills and releases of flour from imported stocks, after a sharp rise to 102,400 tons per week in May, fell again in June to 92,600. tons per week. As. compared with a year ago, total deliveries and-releases in the first quarter of this year showed an increase of 11 per cent., but on the second quarter there was a decrease of 4&quot;7 per cent., leaving over the six months a net increase of 3&quot;2 per cent, over a year ago, which may be taken to be the measure of increased consumption. It may be observed that this increase barely balances the increase of population arising from the return of troops from overseas, and leaves,little for any increase of consumption per head of the population. A year ago, the consumption of other food stuffs, especially meat, was severely restricted, and this was reflected in an increase in the consumption of bread, which on the pre-war rate per head amounted to 19 per cent., so that Qven the maintenance of the per head rate of a year ago, docs not contradict the statement of a tendency to increased consumption.        .Fish. The following table illustrates the supplies of fish during June and their distribution:-Fish Supplies in June;	June 19.19.	May 19] 9.

Total supplies landed on the coasts of the United Kingdom again showed an increase, and the comparison with a year ago marks the recovery of the fishing industry from war conditions. In June, as compared with May, there was an increase of over 11,000 tons in the herrings landed at Scottish ports, where a large proportion is retained at this season for curing. This may explain the actual decreases in the total supplies of fish at the large urban markets between the two months.Other Foodstuffs. During June the weekly rate of cheese distribution was raised to a level which, taken with the free supplies of home cheese, represented about 3,400 tons per week available for consumption within the United Kingdom; this is substantially the pre-war rate of consumption taken over a whole year, but is probably below the corresponding pre-war seasonal figure. The weekly production of margarine in June fell to 6,800 tons, as compared with 7,400 tons in May, but it was still considerably above the rate for June 1918, viz., 4,100 tons. The distribution of butter remained on the basis of 2 oz. per head, which was approximately the quantity distributed a year ago. Free home supplies of butter probably suffered somewhat from the drought, but it is estimated that total supplies of butter and margarine for direct consumption in the United Kingdom were still nearly 1,000 tons per week in excess of those of June 1918..Prices. ;The statistics&apos;collected by the Ministry of Labour show for the first time since the Armistice a marked increase in average retail food prices. The increase on July 1914, which stood.at 104 per cent, on June 2nd, rose by July 1st to 109 percent., as compared with 133 per cent, on November 1st, 1918.Following the increase in the official maximum, the price of milk rose 16 per cent., or by the full penny, to l\d. per quart. Eggs rose \2\ per cent, to 4s. per dozen, though the latter is still below the price a year ago, when they were 4s. 2\d. per dozen. Margarine was returned at Is. Id. per lb., an advance of 11 per cent, on the month, and fish, which had been falling steadily since October, rose by 9 per cent. Tea also showed a slight increase and the prices of other articles were substantially unaltered.Wholesale prices in June showed little change on those for May except in the group of oilseeds. Canadian bacon moved upwards from 190s. to 193s. 2d. per cwt., and tea also showed a further increase, Indian rising from Is. Id. to Is. 3fd. per lb. and Ceylon from ll^d. to Is. Id. per lb. during the month. In the group of oilseeds, the most startling, increase wTas in the case of cotton seed, which stood at 700s. per ton throughout the month, as compared with 380s. for May. Linseed reached 1,010s. per ton in the last week of June, and the average for the month marked an increase on May from 863s. to 973s. M. per ton. Palm kernels also rose from 675s. to 865s. per ton.  In the group of oilseed cakes, there were no marked changes.&apos;k 8532
