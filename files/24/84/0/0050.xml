T hint isecret.ovpi-nrnenij$Si Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for V &apos;        ^     \Sth July 1919.India,July (Received 19th.)18th July 1919. No. 9730. Our information of the last few days appears to indicate that Amir not only negatively failing&apos;to comply with armistice (corrupt group), hut in his dealings with frontier tribes he is actively violating the conditions. Reasons for these conclusions are as follows :  1. Chitral reports Mehtar have received information that Afghans have crossed Zigdig Pass into Lutkuf Valley, and that Afghans are on Shui Pass threatening Bogosht Valley, while other reports, not yet confirmed, state troops from Faizabad moving towards Dorah Pass.2. Visit of Shahghasi and Khwaja Muhammad to Tirah on campaign to recruit &quot;Afridis and incite them to hostilities appears to be fully confirmed, vide our No. 9620, dated 16th July, and No. 9683, dated 17th July. As a result of his mission, our latest information is that L&apos;0,000 Afridis, collected in Bazar Valley, moved to Choraessay 17th, and attack on. Khyber expected to-day. Nadir Khan&apos;s intrigue with Waziris and Mahsuds have been frequently imported and have been main factor in keeping Tochi area unsettled.4. (? 3) Daulat Shah active, and presence of small Afghan force at Wana (vide our No. 9236, dated 10th July, and iNo. 9510, elated 14th July), are having similar disturbing effect in South Waziristan and Zhob.- 5. (? 4) Incursion of Waziris into Zhob (vide my No. 9510, dated 14th July, para. 3) has led to several disturbances. On 14th July convoy from Lakaband to Fort Sandeman was held up at Babar. Column moved out from Fort Sandeman and relieved convoy, but was surrounded and majority believed captured near Kapip on return journey. Attackers reported as 1,500 Waziris and Bhittanis, joined during, course of fight by Sherannis and Haripals.
