It occurred to me that his estimate of the situation would be of interest and perhaps of use to you.Yours faithfully, (Sgd.)   R.L.

1261 *!, First Street, Confidential. Long Beach, Calif.Sir James Lougheed, 21st June, 1919.Ottawa..Dear Sir James,I have to thank you for your reyly and for some copies of - the Canadian official Record which have arrived.I intended writing the Premier as to the Irish question and the doings of the Irish people here in regard to &quot;Self-doteimina-tion for small nations&quot;.   There is a strong and growing rcovi^ent-to bring the strongest pressure on president Wilson to insist on the Conference taking up the case of Ireland as one of the &quot;small nations&quot; and to give it absolute Independence, if the majority jn Ireland so desire.   In the present temper of the Irish people there is little doubt but an overwhelming majority would vote for absol^t^ severance from Great Britain,   I have been arguing with the Leaders here that Home ftule on the lines substantially as we have it in Canada would be better for Ireland than a Republic1 but I cannot get a patient hearing event   I have tried some of the newspapers with an article advocating A Real Home Rule Act, but so far they decline, under one excuse or another, to use my article.   I pre-some the real objection is that they find the Irish sentiment so strong for a Republic that they do not wish to antagonize so 3trong a body.   I know that a nation wide propaganda is being organised to sveep the United States in bringing pressure en Wilson.   I could get an engagement as a speaker if I would accept it to advocate a Republic, but no mere advocacy of Home Rule in any form would satisfy them.   I had as I said intended writing the premier direct but as I am not very well acquainted with him I am taking this method of attaining the same end through you.   I know
that the jTml^-i^T*43T^^ &quot;to tome^m^aad 1 1frwfc*gtvxthat every friend of the l&amp;npire aa well as -rvf Ireland should take cognizance of the present critical situation and see if the British Government would not&apos; 3ee the political advantage Of heading&apos;off the &quot;independence&quot; movement by offerings liberal Home Rule Measure before it is too late,   Personally, of course, I am clearly of opinion, even as. an ardent irishman, that Home Rule, something as we have it in Canada, would meet all their aspirations and in every way be better for Ireland than their crazy Republic idea.-  Would Sir Robert Borden consider the offering of advice to Ll^yd George on the subject.? * Perhaps you would not object to showing sir Robert this letter. Being on the spot I know that the present movement is not &quot;Bluff&quot; but a determined effort to marshal   all American &quot;Democratic-&quot; sentiment to press the President to use all his influence with the Donference in the direction of securing self-determination for Ireland, and you know enough of Politics, especially as it is in U.S, and a Preai-dential election next year, to realise what will be the effect of such pressure.The recent vote in the Senate - 60 to 1 - is strong encourage-ment to them to use this pressure.   I expect that in a few weeiCs&quot; there will be a vigorous campaign, on the stump and in the press and rtherwise to work up feeling outside of the Irish themselves and both, political parties will fall over themselves in getting in on the bandwaggon to get the vote.So the President will be swainped with &quot;Resolutions&quot; demanding that he act.   Besides the temper of the Senate and nc doubt of Congress will be to vote down concurrence or approval of the Peace Treaty unless something is done for Ireland.I leave it to your own good judgment as to bringing this before Sir Robert for his consideration and possible action in the way of advice or suggestion to Lloyd George.I am actually looked at with suspicion here for not being willing to &quot;go the whole hog&quot; so to speak, on the Irish question and I wish you to treat this as strictly confidential and private^With best wishes, I remain,Faithfully,(Sgd.)   THOS . H. MoGTJIRS.
