(Received 11 a.m., 21st.)1065 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.    Following from  Roos-Keppel, dated 19th. June (?): &quot; A reliable man from Kabul reports that when he left there about 10 clays ago there was much disagreement among Amir&apos;s advisers regarding the despatch of delegates, and especially regarding Peace terms. Mahmud Tarzi and extremist. party are pressing Amir to make large demands, but moderates including some of selected delegates protested against a fruitless mission. Majority of Afghans were in favour of peace on any reasonable terms, but extremists and foreigners are trying to force Amir into Avar and their influence appeared to be predominating. Army - does not want war, and it is very difficult to keep large bodies of tribesmen together for a long time. Within the last few days very large sums of money have been issued from Jelalabad to tribal leaders to feed the lashkar. Officials in Ningrahar and Nadir Khan in Khost have assured Amir that they can, if given sufficient money, bring on a general tribal rising, thus causing a war of attrition between tribes and British forces and giving Amir time to consolidate his position, re-distribute his army and possibly to get assistance from Russia. - It appears almost certain Afghans are making a supreme effort to induce the Afridis to rise in the (corrupt group) hopes that if they do so, all the tribes to the north and south will rise in sympathy, but it looks as if Afghans may fail once more to raise tribes. &apos; Qazi Abdul Wali (corrupt group) was given a firman by the Amir to receive from Naib Salar of Jelalabad Nazim Dost Muhammad Khan two lakhs of rupees and five lakhs cartridges for the Afridis.&quot; Dost Muhammad Khan, jealous of Kazi Abdul Wali, refused to give the rupees or ammunition without further (corrupt group ? reference to) Amir. He reported that Abdul Wali Avas a man of no character or position and would probably embezzle the money and make his oavh terms with the British, and suggested sending his own younger brother Shahgassi Khwaia Muhammad Khan to Tirah instead. The Amir agreed to this, and the Shahgassi brought a large (corrupt group ? establishment) to Bazar which he has used to (corrupt group ? treat) all deserters and discharged men of (corrupt group) regiments and militia. Afridi Maiiks and elders&apos; and the bulk of the tribe are anxious not to break off relations with British and are doing all in their power to prevent a general tribal rising, though they are not strong enough forcibly to resist the large bodies of desperate men whom, the Shahgassi has in his pay. The Zakka Khel Maiiks have induced their tribesmen in the Khyber Karamna Barg Ilacha and Bazar to oppose the lashkar and to refuse them passage over their passes, and this caused the lashkar to move toAvards Chura. Lashkar is now reported to be retreating towards Bazar and Afridi jirga are breaking up the gatherings and many (corrupt group) have already left for Tirah.&quot; Supplies are a difficulty, and hitherto Shahgassi has only sent about (corrupt group) mule loads of food which barely suffices for lashkar and (corrupt group) for a day and, unless he can send supplies on a large scale, he will hardly be able to hold even the enlisted men together. Afridis suspected Kazi Abdul Wali of having secured a large sum of money for himself and a plot was set on foot among the lashkar to kill and rob him, but he suspected something and escaped to Ningrahar&apos; yesterday. The Maiiks and elders have been in constant communication with Sir Abdul Qadyum for the last few days and he considers it probable that Afghan movements in Tirah will once more prove&apos;a failure. A large lashkar of Sangu Khel Shinwaris has gathered at Darband close to Khargali, but they are (corrupt group) Wano. Muhammad Akbar Khan has been given a credit of three lakhs of rupees at Jelalabad to spend among Mohmands and Shinwaris, of Avhich he has drawn and expended Rs. 55,000. All grain in Ningrahar is being collected and paid for by means of advance revenue receipts for as much as two and three years. Kurram reports that one heaAy gun supposed to be the one (corrupt group) at ThalAvas&apos; removed from Lakatiga neighbourhood to Kharlachi on 16th instant., &quot; Reilly telegraphs 18th instant 7 hours that it is reported that Afghans attacked Bimboret on 17th and that a picket on the Loar (corrupt group) Avas attacked by tribesmen who crossed from Dir territory (corrupt group) no details. A cavalry picket was attacked last night near Bannu by a raiding gang. Tavo soAvars wounded. All. other districts and agencies quiet.&quot;
