From Viceroy,&apos;. Foreign Department, lhth July 1910. (Received 15th, 11:30 pan.)1042 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Khyber reports that Afghan official, styling himself General, with about 200 sepoys, crossed into Tirah few days ago and is encamped near Bagh, where he has been joined by deserters from militia and army and others. Afridis were to hold combined-jirga yesterday to decide on line ; if true, is of course direct breach of ann-istice terms, but it may be clue to intrigue of Nasrulla party, whose aim it is to prolong war, and thereby secure overthrow of Amanulla. Anyway we propose to await developments for the present.
