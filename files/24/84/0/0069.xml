I-REPORT BY MAJOR 0. L. KNYVETT, CAPTAIN 0.W.BELL AND CAPTAIN H. M. HEN WOOD ON A VISIT TO SILESIA, &apos;15th  MARCH-11th APRIL.A. Narrative. B.-Military Eeport. C. Economic Eeport. D. Transportation. E.-Political.A.-NARRATIVE.Leaving London at 12 noon on Saturday, 15th March, the party travelled via Folkestone Boulogne Charrleroi Pepinster to Spa, where we reported to the British Mission (Major-General Haking) for instructions. We proceeded to Cologne on the following evening (17th March), took final instructions from 2nd Army Headquarters and caught the Berlin express at 1.45 a.m. (19th March). With three double-berthed compartments to ourselves, the journey was in every way comfortable and the train ran well up to time. A tin of bully beef and the remains of our picnic luncheon to the conductor served to spare us any unpleasant arguments as to whether or no we were to pay for our sleeping berths or in fact for our tickets. Berlin (Potsdamer Bahnhof), where we detrained at 6 p.m., was crowded, but the people were orderly and we had no difficulty with our 15 items of luggage. Accommodation had been reserved for us at the Esplanade Hotel three minutes&apos; walk from the station. This is the smartest hotel in Berlin and every room is occupied, the guests being of all categories. A letter was awaiting us from Major A., who had acted as liaison officer to the British Food Commission which visited Berlin in February, and with whom Captain Bell had communicated in advance. The letter is quoted as representing the attitude of the most broad-thinking Germans to-day towards so-called Lebensmittelkorrmdssionen: &quot; My dear Captain Bell, I should have thought that our position was sufficiently clear by now to render further investigations superfluous, but of course I may be mistaken. If you think that I can do my country any good by hints I might give for your mission to Silesia, I shall be at the disposal of you and your friends here or in the hotel at any time to-night or to-morrow. Being a Silesian, I naturally take a special interest in everything relating to my native province. Personally, I shall be glad to meet you again, as I liked the way in which you and Captains Stewart-Roddie and Tennant acquitted yourselves of your duties in Berlin.   Yours sincerely, A.&quot;After a quick dinner, we went straight round to A.&apos;s house, where he was awaiting us and where we were received in the most friendly manner. It is necessary to explain that A. is a typical diplomat and an aristocrat. An officer of the Guard Corps, and unmistakably a supporter of the ex-Emperor, he is now only giving his services in a semi-official manner to the new Government, striving, as he so frankly puts it, to do what little an individual like himself can to keep his country afloat in these critical times. When Captain Bell first made his acquaintance in Berlin (4 weeks previously), he already viewed the political situation with considerable anxiety. Now his last hopes seemed to be flittering away. Recent events in Bavaria and in the capital itself had brought fresh disturbing elements to light. Reasonable, well-educated, patriotic people, he stated, were daily becoming infected with Spartacism. The movement, in his opinion, and, as it seemed, to his knowledge, had spread to far more dangerous and more powerful circles.   There was a wealth of brains and money
behind it. The Ebert Government had neither the will nor the ability to check it. Every day the tension was growing, and he, who was watching events with the keenest of eyes, could only see gloom and chaos ahead, unless by some magic and lightning stroke, delivered with the utmost strength and determination, a fresh and as yet undreamed of party could snatch the red-hot fuel out of the fire.. All the rest of the &quot;world, he said, was marking timer; while a horrible and deadly influence was eating its way into the very heart of Europe. &apos;. , &apos;Questioned almost openly as to whether there was not some truth in&apos; the suggestion that Prussian militarists, under a fresh disguise, were stirring up quasi-Spartacist demonstrations in Germany with ulterior objectives, A. said : &quot;No, there is only one &apos; Spartakus&apos; and that is the real thing an offspring of Russian Bolshevism  which is proving itself capable of infecting all kinds and conditions of men.&quot; The remedies, if these are not now too late, are (l) food, and (2) an iron hand. The arguments in favour of these remedies are simple. First of all the people are literally starving, or, if the term be preferred, almost unbearably hungry. The continued inability to live as civilized people have been accustomed to do in the past, i.e., to feed well, be properly clothed and usefully employed, has passed beyond endurance and there are as yet no visible, still less tangible, signs of any change, such as the conclusion of hostilities led everyone to expect. Secondly, if these hardships must continue, the strong hand is no longer there to dictate matters as it formerly did. The dissatisfied and unemployed German public is now weighing up the situation and saying to itself &quot; The Government which brought us all this misery has gone thank God for that  the majority Socialist Government which took its place has been incapable of improving matters, therefore we have but one last hope left Spartacism. We have nothing to lose, let us destroy everything and let the Avhole world learn to suffer the ignominies which we have endured for the last 4^ years.&quot;After we had expounded the objects of our visit to Silesia and explained how greatly a few personal introductions from him to competent authorities would help us, A. promised that he would think matters over and call upon us the following afternoon.On Thursday morning, the 20th March, we called upon Dr. D. at the offices of the Armistice Commission (Budapestherstrasse 14) to arrange for the continuation of our journey passes, railway-warrants, &amp;c. He gave us a pass signed by Erzberger, and assured us that it would suffice to carry us anywhere and everywhere. . Before lunch, we called at the British Embassy and met Colonel Tidbury and Major Thorburn, from whom we learnt all about the recent riots in Berlin. We were warned not to visit certain quarters unless we did so in mufti. The impression gained was to the effect that life in Berlin to-day is distinctly precarious. After lunch at the Esplanade Hotel, we saw Major A. He gave us letters of introduction to a Major B. (Chief of Staff, VI&apos; Army Corps in Breslau), and to his own brother at Liegnitz. He further advised us that the Railway Authorities (Eisenbahn Direktion, Breslau) would be warned of our impending arrival to enquire into transport conditions. Altogether A. had proved himself most useful, and painstaking. He asked us to come and see him again on our homeward journey, as he would be most interested to hear how we had fared in his native province. In his letter to B. he urged the advisability of our being initiated into the Polish and Czecho-Slovak problems. He further suggested that we ought to visit units of the Southern Army and have personal talks with the men. On Friday morning (21st March), in compliance with instructions received in Spa, we called upon Legationsekretcir Thermann at the Foreign Office. He again notified us that we should be given every facility in Breslau of investigating the transport situation-both river and rail. Dr. D, met us for lunch at the Bristol Hotel, where we tackled a long menu of all possible delicacies at extravagant prices. He requested us to postpone our departure until the 23rd, in order that we might meet certain officials of the P.W.D. and hear from Headquarters the difficulties which the shortage of rolling-stock is presenting. An American-born friend, of Dr. D.&apos;s, Frau C. by name, came to tea with us at the Esplanade Hotel and helped to reduce our stock of ginger-bread biscuits and other delicacies, which we had brought over from England. She was, however, not of sufficient intelligence to enlighten us on the more serious problems with which we were concerned. The day concluded with a supper at Kuttner&apos;s (at Dr. D.&apos;s suggestion). Here we obtained a glimpse into one of BerhVs most fashionable dance clubs and were treated to a number,of rag-time tunes, most of which carried us back to pre-war days, but which evidently have been better able to stand the test of time in Germany.    As we were leaving the restaurant,
we were stopped by representatives of. the Soldatenrat who asked for our papers. When we told them that we were British officers, they were almost polite as well as satisfied.Our gathering at the P.W.D. offices on Saturday morning (22nd March) was an exceedingly formal one and the reception given us was cold, if not almost unfriendly. One of the officials (Herr E.) had been present in February when, in a similar meeting, the transport difficulties had been categorically represented to Captain Bell&apos;s first mission. It was again evident that &quot;commissions&quot; are becoming unpopular and that their utility from a German point of view is a matter for much scepticism. We listened to renewed complaints about the deliveries of locos and wagons to the Allies and the wretched railway conditions throughout the country. When we explained that our investigations would be confined more or less to Silesia, we were told that we should not find the same congestion on the main line Berlin Breslau as could be seen elsewhere, but that we should find the following outstanding difficulties,: 1. Shortage of rolling stock and locos, mainly the latter, for the distribution of coal from the Silesian fields to the interior.2. Polish occupation in East Prussia, involving the disuse of normal direct communications between Oberschlesien and the north-eastern frontier district.3. Upkeep of available locos, owing to the lack of proper metals such as copper and tin, resulting in constant breakdowns of axles and bearings. After the meeting, the party separated and each of us went to different places for lunch. Captain Bell had been invited by a Dr. P., whose acquaintance he had made during his first mission to Berlin. Dr. F. is a leading spirit in German charitable and Red Cross undertakings, and, as such, comes into contact with many interesting and influential people. He is a personal friend of Graf Bantzau (Minister of Foreign Affairs) and has had many recent conversations with this gentleman. Dr. F. himself is perhaps ultra sentimental, but as a Well-educated, serious-thinking man, who is in constant touch with officials of all departments, his opinion must be taken as valuable. First of all he confirmed Major A.&apos;s declaration to the effect that Spartacist influences were eating their way into new and more dangerous circles, i.e., those of the educated classes. With a perfectly open field before them and no competition from any other of the Allies, the Americans, he stated, had been purchasing large interests in all kinds of German industrial concerns by promising big credits and ample raw material as soon as the blockade is lifted. According to Dr. F., this procedure has been in progress for more than two months and the result in view is a very serious American monopoly of German trade. An American Chamber of Commerce, with a large and daily increasing staff, is functioning in Berlin for this sole purpose.Our departure for Breslau, which had been fixed for Sunday morning, the 23rd March, was again delayed owing to a mistake of the Hotel hall porter. We arrived at the station at 7 a.m. only to see our train steam out. The morning was therefore spent in visiting that portion of Berlin which had been the scene of the most recent fighting, namely, the Alexanderplatz several houses in this quarter having been completely destroyed and many others badly damaged by field guns and heavy Minen-werfer. We left Berlin (Zoologischer Garten Bahnhof) at 10.17 p.m., 23rd March. Dr. D. came to see us off at the station and we had a coupe specially reserved for us. There were no sleeping compartments and the night was not particularly comfortable ; moreover we were woken up more than once by other travellers who had failed to obtain seats and whose jealousy had been aroused by seeing our carriage only half occupied. It was with some difficulty that we kept would-be intruders out. On arriving at Breslau at 6 a.m. (24th March), we were met by Rittmeister G., who had been chosen by VI Corps Headquarters as our liaison officer. He took us straight over to the Nord Hotel, where two very musty rooms had been reserved for the three of us. At 11 o&apos;clock we started on our business at the Rathaus, where several officials had been summoned to meet us. The principal of these was the Oberbiirgermeister H. He is a pleasant and competent man of the new regime and has only been in office for six or eight weeks. After having explained the object of our visit, namely, an enquiry into the food,, economic and transport problems, it Was unanimously decided that the food problem should be first tackled and that a meeting for this purpose should take place in the historic assembly hall at 5 p.m. The Ober-burgermeister, in a very humanely worded speech, drew our attention again to the fact that food commissions had been in and out of Germany for the last five months, and that the result of these from the German point of view was so far nil.   He begged us,
during our visit to Silesia, to take note of the patient manner in which this province in particular has been, and still is, bearing all its hardships. He explained to us that throughout the war it behaved better than any other province in Germany. There was only one strike among the coal miners early in 1917, and this was immediately settled by the simplest of means a few comforting words. To-day Silesia is being put to an extreme test in that (1) the people are hungry, (2) there is not sufficient work owing to lack of raw materials, (3) Bolshevist propaganda is doing its best to arouse the population, (4) the threat of Polish and Czecho-Slovak annexation is stirring up great indignation. &quot; We are faced,&quot; he continued, &quot; with one big problem after another, and so far we have been able to keep our people in hand. But the time has come when help from outside is imperative. First of all, give us food. Do not, when you send your food-ships to German harbours, forget Silesia, Do not be too anxious to argue that Silesia, because it has so far kept quiet, can wait till the last, and that larger towns and other industrial districts, which have proved unruly, must be the only ones to be served. The great common enemy to-day is Bolshevism. We in Silesia, by keeping order and by closing our frontiers, are helping to preserve Western Europe from the ravages of Bolshevism.   Reward and strengthen us by giving us food.&quot;At noon we paid a formal call on the Regierungsprdsident and then we proceeded to the Local Sduglingsheim, where we saw, above everything, how seriously the shortage of milk had affected the health of the younger generation.Lunch at the Nord Hotel was a miserable business. It was evident now that we had been installed there with a purpose, and it was not long before G. admitted to the plot which was, however, not his.At 5 p.m., our first big conference with the various Breslau food experts took place in the magnificent Furstensaal of the Rathaus. Oberregierungsrat Dr. I. and the Oberburgermeister presided each in turn, and we were treated to lengthy speeches, the details of which are recorded in a separate report. We are bound to admit that Germany possesses a sound case in claiming early relief. There is a genuine shortage of all staple foodstuffs, rations of which are far too small for any civilized folk. The health of the whole population has suffered very seriously as a result of the hard-ships endured during the last three years. Nerves have become unstrung, and a stage has been reached when the empty-bellied working classes can no longer be trusted to keep the peace. Being essentially an agricultural province, potato supplies in Silesia are better than in the other parts of Germany. The principal shortage lies in meats and fats. The lack of body-building foods is a very serious matter in the mining and industrial centres of Upper Silesia. It is here, and in large towns like Breslau, that immediate relief is wanted. The conference did not break up until well after 8 o&apos;clock. We then went back to the hotel for dinner and early bed. The next morning (25th March), we left the hotel at 9 o&apos;clock and proceeded to Walden-burg (about 90 km. by road), a town of some 20,000 inhabitants, beautifully situated in the Eulengebirge. The party consisted of G., Dr. I., Herr J. and ourselves. The object of the trip was to meet the Landrat of Waldenburg and to enquire into local conditions, ruling in this most important coal-mining and industrial centre incidentally too, to have personal talks with the workmen themselves. We reached Waldenburg vid Schweidnitz at about 11.30 a.m. and went straight to a conference in the Municipal Hall. Here, we listened first of all to a discourse on the food and economic questions. We were again attacked about our so-called &quot; Lebensmittelkommissionen&quot; and finally the trades&apos; union representatives warned us that this was no time for words, but rather for the most speedy action. They explained the lack of &quot; moral&quot; among the mining and industrial workmen, how embittered they had become by reason of the misery they themselves and their families are still suffering, owing to the apparent incapability of any Government (German or Allied) to improve matters. They dwelt upon the urgent danger of Bolshevism, which, they declared, was working its evils all around Silesia dangerously, close to a community which now must obviously be a susceptible one. They added, however, that the Silesian workmen is a lover of peace and prosperity, not of plunder and ruin, and that it would not take more than a, few herrings a week to keep him quiet. &quot; Let one ship with foodstuffs destined for Silesia arrive in Stettin and a definite announce-ment to that effect be made in the local Press, and an instant change for the better will immediately follow.&quot; This was his honest belief. &quot; Delay much longer a,nd we are at the mercy of Bolshevism.&quot; It was here that Herr J., who had accompanied us from Breslau, and who is himself a factory owner in Charlottenbrunn (near Waldenburg), got up and spoke in the most eloquent and convincing fashion.    His theme was to the effect that Silesia is sitting on the edge of a
Bolshevik volcano (1) because it is starving, (2) because it is threatened with invasion from all sides and (3) because no help appears to be coming from within. He said very little in the presence of the workmen, but, after the meeting had broken up, he asked to talk to us privately and in confidence, and he begged us to treat the affair as desperately urgent not a matter of weeks but of days or even hours. It was arranged that we should meet him the next day in Breslau and go closely into all the points he was anxious to raise. These are dealt with later on and more) particularly in our political report. As a result of our conference, a telegram was despatched to the British Mission in Spa, to the effect that Silesia&apos;s case required urgent consideration, and that one of the first of our food-ships should if possible be directed to supply this province. A few words from us to the workmen, explaining some of the difficulties with which the Allies had had to contend, and the reasons for which delays were bound to occur, seemed to have a good effect. They talked to us freely during luncheon in the local &quot; Oarlton,&quot; and thanked us heartily for having honoured them with a visit. We arrived back in Breslau at 6 p.m., dined, and then went by invitation to the opera (D&apos;Albert&apos;s &quot;Stier von Olivera&quot;): The next morning (26th March), we were received by Major B. (Chief of Staff, VI Army Corps), his adjutant, K., was also present. We had, as has already been stated, a letter of introduction from Major A., and it was obvious from the outset that Major B. was out to help us in any way he could. After certain preliminaries, we mentioned the importance which Herr J. and others seemed to attach to the Polish and Czecho-Slovak problems, and the alleged danger of Bolshevism which might result from any annexations in Silesia. We soon found that B. was only too anxious to discuss these points with us.He laid particular emphasis on the fact that (a.) The Silesian Volunteer Army is of good fighting material and of daily increasing strength.(b.) It would sternly resist any attempt - at annexation either on the part of thePoles or the Czecho-Slovaks. (c.) It is at present devoting most of its energies towards checking the spread ofBolshevist propaganda.   For this purpose it is, however, not strong enough. (d.) If Bolshevism is to be adequately dealt with, a continuous front must beestablished and properly manned from the North Sea to Bavaria, (e.) The Allies&apos; help is of most urgent necessity.   The despatch of Allied militaryand political commissions to Breslau (not to Berlin) to study and deal withthe Bolshevist threats would be greatly welcomed. (/) Too much French influence in similar commissions, now functioning in poland and elsewhere, is proving dangerous. The French policy cannot be toleratedand is proving a direct incentive to Bolshevism.It was arranged that we should visit some of the volunteer units, inspect their kitchens and speak with the men. The impression with which we came, away was that there was no desire whatever to conceal anything military or otherwise from the British and that we were completely trusted.We lunched with Herr J. at the Savoy Hotel, where the food was excellent -all the result of most blatant Schleichhandel. As each luxurious dish appeared the maitre d&apos;hotel (weight about 16 stone) came and expounded to us the difficulties with which he was permanently faced in order to find the wherewithal to feed himself and his guests. His was, however, one of the exceptional cases which did not convince us, nor even our friend J. In the course of lunch we discussed our previous day&apos;s meeting in Waldenburg and it was evident that J. had a great deal more to say also that he was the local authority in the Polish and Czech problems. Captain Bell therefore invited him to dine that same evening, while Major Knyvett and Captain Hen wood entertained K. and G.J. argues as follows: 1. Poland with its four separate &quot;Governments&quot; in Warsaw, Posen, &quot; Bolsheviskia &quot; and Paris, is ripe for trouble. The Paderewski regime has not got the support of the majority and must soon go. When the tide turns, the change will be drastic and extreme. No country is less equipped than Poland to fight Bolshevism. Therefore, Silesia must be ready at any moment to meet a vast Bolshevist army threatening its Northern and and Eastern frontiers.
2. Hungary is in the throes of Bolshevism. Czecho-Slovakia is at present healthy and, with luck, may remain so, but here again there is the undeniable danger that Silesia might sooner or later be threatened on her Southern frontier.3. Most of Germany, and notably Bavaria and Berlin, is slowly but surely being infected by the Bolshevist microbe. . .4. By reason of the above, Silesia sees itself surrounded on all sides by Bolshevism in one form or another. So far, the province has remained healthy, the causes being (a.) A naturally peacefully inclined population. (6.) Industrial and agricultural prosperity, (c.) Military efficiency.5. There is real reason to fear internal collapse in Silesia, unless food and raw material soon comes to relieve the present scarcity of both, and unless the Silesians are soon given the assurance that no programme of annexation is being contemplated in Paris.Herr J. stated that his latest, information from a Paris source was to the effect that the whole of the Grafsehaft Glatz and the Waldenburg coalfields were to go to the Czechs, and that the Kattowite coal area was to be surrendered to Poland. He insisted that, if these conditions are included in the Allied peace terms, one of two things must happen; either the German Government will refuse to sign the treaty, or Silesia will literally rise up in arms, and, as a last resource, turn Bolshevist.J. entreated our mission to visit the frontiers, speak to the people and&apos; draw its own conclusions as to whether they would be willing to submit to Polish or Czech rule then report -to competent, authorities. He also urged that no time should be lost in clearing up this all-important question. Failure to do this might render vain all the present efforts to check the spread of Bolshevism. &quot; Germany &quot; he said, &quot; knows that she is beaten and that she has got to pay. She will pay, but you must give her a chance, not deprive her of all the means.   Her riches lie : 1. In Alsace-Lorraine. 2. In Silesia.Take one of them perhaps, but don&apos;t try and take both and all. Don&apos;t be too ambitious in dealing with a nation of 70 million inhabitants, you cannot wipe it out altogether.&quot;Major Knyvett and Captain Henwood&apos;s conversation with K. and G. went far to confirm all that Herr J. had said and to suggest that Silesia would fight to the last man to preserve her own rights.On Thursday morning, 27th March, Captain Henwood left for Berlin and Spa with a preliminary report on what we had so far seeu and heard. On the same day, Major Knyvett and Captain Bell moved to the Monopol Hotel where a comfortable suite of rooms was provided.In the morning, a visit was paid to the local communal kitchen, and the various foodstuffs, prepared there for public consumption, were sampled. The food was, to say the least of it, most unpalatable and unnutritious. The fact, that the kitchen cooked and served 100,000 portions daily, not only proved its popularity, but also the genuine hunger of those who partook of its uninviting menu. A formal introduction to the ober prasident of the province was followed by a tour of the town and casual visits to individual houses. Ten different families were asked without warning to show me over their kitchens and larders. Everywhere the same picture was seen the struggle of the &quot; Hausfrau &quot; to find two meals daily for her husband and children. No meat, no fats, no &quot; extras &quot; only the limited rations of potatoes, &amp;c. The conditions were truly pitiable, the courage of the womenfolk could not but be admired.In the evening, we called on the Catholic Bishop of Breslau, a great personality and an old friend of the ex-Emperor. He repeated the same story which we had so often heard regarding the Bolshevist perils and inexpediency of drastic annexations. He understood and appreciated the desire of the French to see a weak Germany, but he hoped, for the sake of the future welfare of Europe, that unjust and exaggerated territorial acquisition would not be undertaken.   As regards the Czechs
and the Poles, he was convinced that it would be a big mistake to give them rule over German territories or to expect them to keep order in and develop districts where everything has been German (including the population)&apos; for centuries past. He implored us to make a deep study of the food conditions, adding that he knew we could only arrive at one conclusion. Finally, he showed us how the Czecho-Slovaks have taken by force the administration of his estates and dominion in the Suditic Mountains, and how the whole of his episcopal resources (about 800,000 marks yearly) have thereby become lost to him and his diocesans (mainly German-Catholics).N.B. The Bishopric of Breslau is the largest in Europe; nine-tenths of the diocese is on German soil. Its wealth, however, was derived almost entirely from certain estates in Johannesberg-Jauering (formerly in Austria, and now annexed by the Ozecho-Slovak Republic). .On Friday, the 28th March, we were received by a Dr. L., Controller of the Inland Water Transport on the Oder. He began by showing us certain statistics in his office, and then took us for a trip round Breslau harbour in a steam launch. It appears that&apos; the Oder, given a satisfactory water level, can, with its present fleet of barges, carry anything between 500,000 and 750,000 tons a month. In actual practice, it is doing much less than this at present, owing, for instance, to the inability of the railways to move accumulated stocks of coal from the mines to the point of embarkation. The same applies to many other commodities for which water transport is employed. The Oder could very easily handle big shiploads of imported goods between, say, Stettin and Silesia in the event of a raising of the blockade. There is no congestion whatsoever on the river, and big harbours like Breslau and Oppeln are amply provided with wharves and cranes for unloading purposes. -L., who spoke excellent English, came to lunch with us at the hotel, where a quiet afternoon was spent.   In the evening G. and K. dined with us.On Saturday, 29th March, Captain Bell met the officials of the Eisenbahn Direktion, while Major Knyvett visited a volunteer unit (Detachment Kiihne) just outside Breslau.The particular difficulties with which Silesia has to contend in the matter of rail-way transport had already been outlined in Berlin. In Breslau, closer details were given and some interesting figures shown. It was explained that, prior to the war, Konigsberg and other towns in North-Eastern Prussia drew practically all their coal requirements from Wales. Now these have to be provided by Silesia and by a very round-about route. The Polish occupation has rendered the railway journey from Kattowitz Konigsberg over 250 km. longer than it used to be.The shortage of locos and wagons has made it necessary to introduce a system of permits for all transportation by rail. Only the most important classes of consignments are accepted by the railway at all. Figures were produced to show that even those consignments, for which special &quot;urgency permits&quot; are obtained, have often to wait weeks before the railway can finally deal with them.As regards the ability of the railway to tackle additional traffic eastwards, such as would be occasioned by the repatriation of Russian Prisoners of War and the import of foodstuffs, it was pointed out that a large proportion of the present eastward traffic, i.e.y to Silesia, from the interior of Germany consists of empties. The reason for this is that no. raw materials are coming in and that the exports from Silesia (principally coal and potatoes) have always been in considerable excess of the imports.The evening we spent as guests of the Oberbiirgermeister, first of all at the Opera (Die Weisse Dame) and then at supper at Han sens, the best restaurant in the town.Sunday, 30th March, was a quiet day. We employed our time in packing up our things and writing our reports. It had been decided that we should leave Breslau by car together with G. early the following morning and a delightful trip to Glatz and the Bohemian frontier was planned.We left Breslau on Monday morning, 31st March, at 10 o&apos;clock in a&quot; German military car (Benz) and arrived at Glatz in time for lunch. Two hours later we were in the midst of the Eulengebirge, where the road and trees were covered in snow.. (The Grafschaft Glatz is one of the renowned health resorts of Germany). We soon reached the Bohemian frontier where we had various conversations with villagers and peasants. We found several Czech-speaking families (there are three villages in this neighbour 1$ hood, where the mother tongue is Czech) and we asked the people what they thought of the Germans and whether they would not rather be under Czecho-Slovak rule. The replies were usually to the effect that they would prefer to remain German some of the less intelligent said they didht care one way or other. All the children speak German and are educated in German schools.   Altogther it is striking
how very German everything is right up to the frontier. At Kudowa we were stopped by the German frontier posts and asked for our passes. We showed our papers signed by Erzberger, and G. asked the soldiers whether they knew who that gentleman was. None of them did ! We then started to drive over a mountain range known as the Henschheuer (4,000 feet high). When about half way up, the car failed to grip into the frozen road and eventually we had to turn back and spend the night in Kudowa a well-known watering place. After dinner at the Fiirstenhof-m excellent modern hotel we were visited by an officer and non-commissioned officer of the local volunteer frontier unit.Next morning early we made for Glatz, where we picked up some petrol and proceeded to Echersdorf. Here we lunched with a Graf 0. in his magnificent castle. The Graf, who treated us with the utmost hospitality, is obviously living in mortal dread of a Bolshevist invasion, involving the seizure of his beautiful property which extends over both sides of the frontier.After lunch we proceeded in a snowstorm vid Charlottenbrunn, Waldenburg, through the Riesengebirge and past Hirschberg to Lauban and Gorlitz, where we arrived at 9.30 p.m. and stayed at the Vierjahreszeiten Hotel. The next morning, at 7 o&apos;clock, we bade goodbye to G. and left Gorlitz by &quot;Bummelzug&quot; for Berlin where we arrived soon after 1 o&apos;clock.We remained in Berlin until the 7th April, at the request of the German Armistice Commission Herr Erzbergpr, who was soon returning from Spa, having expressed a special desire to see us. We made full use of our time in Berlin, getting into touch with as many people as possible, notably Major A., Dr. F., Hauptmann M. (Kriegsministerium) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.Major A. informed us that he had enlisted for service with the Garde Kavallerie Schutzen Division in Berlin, as trouble with the Spartacists was being hourly expected.The next evening (7th April), Major Knyvett returned to Cologne and Captain Bell stayed to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom he had obtained an introduction through Dr. F.The Minister was, if anything, a bit reserved at first. Asked what he thought of the Bolshevist danger, Bantzau said that he could only repeat a statement which he had made in a Secret Cabinet meeting last January : &quot; Bolshevism is the only subject over which Germany and the Entente can possibly meet together at a conference table and act conjointly in the interests of all.&quot;He had no intention of making any overtures, but, at the same time, wished it to be remembered that he had placed all the papers and documents at his disposal before an Allied Commission for investigation.He was prepared to go to any length to convince England, France and America of his own bona fides. What knowledge he himself had he would readily disclose, if thereby the peril of Bolshevism could be better understood and combated.. He said that there were well-informed people in Germany who considered the situation beyond repair he himself was not of this opinion yet.. When Captain Bell left Berlin, the town was in a state of &quot; alarm.&quot; Anti-aircraft guns on lorries and machine guns were posted all about the streets. Government troops, fully armed with hand grenades, &amp;c, were marching about everywhere in formation, and several armoured cars were noticed patrolling the main thoroughfares. Trouble had already broken out in Magdeburg.The journey from Berlin to Spa went, however, without a hitch, and the last news was to the effect that Noske had the situation well in hand.B. MILITARY REPORT.Miscellaneous, The Chief of Staff, VI Army Corps, is Major B. This officer wished to emphasize the fact that the troops, under him are better disciplined and more efficient as a fighting force than other, volunteer cadres raised elsewhere in Germany. The total strength of the volunteer force administered by the VI Corps is estimated roughly at 35,000 men. Infantry companies are, on an average, 100 men strong. The officers and men have nearly all served during the war. The VI Corps, at the close of hostilities, was the first to re-establish itself in Germany, and was. thus in an exceptionally favourable position to gather its men together from the front
and preserve its units intact and in a good state of discipline. From personal visits to several units, both in the immediate neighbourhood of Breslau and on the Bohemian frontier, it was evident that, in Silesia at any rate, more than a little of the old German military discipline still prevails.The main incentive to recruiting is still food, troops being rationed on a far higher scale than civilians.There is a genuine fear at headquarters of the following : 1. Bolshevism both from the east and from the west (e.g., Berlin).2. Invasion from Poland and, to a lesser degree, from Czecho-Slovakia.Silesia.is determined to resist these threats with the utmost stubbornness, and would not hesitate to strike heavily at any point from which danger might emanate.On the Polish frontier, there is reported to be a continuous outpost line with passive hostilities.   At night, Very lights and rockets are freely used by both sides.On the Bohemian frontier, however, we saw for ourselves that fraternization takes place, and the Germans are convinced that the Czechs have no intention of fighting.As regards invasion by the Czecho-Slovaks, there are widely spread rumours that part of the Grafschaft Glatz is to be annexed by the Czechs. We were asked to assure ourselves of the fact that the whole of this province is pure German, and that it would resist any attempts at annexation with all its power. There is no doubt that the feelings of the frontier population are very German and anti-Czech ; and all classes when questioned stated their determination to remain German.* Major B., on this subject, went so far as to say that any peace terms involving the annexation of parts of Silesia could not be entertained.C-ECONOMIC REPORT.The situation as regards food is serious. Silesia is a large agricultural and industrial district, and in peace-time was practically self-supporting. But now, owing to general situation all over Germany, it has to export large stocks of potatoes, and is very little, if at all, better off than any other part of Germany.Owing to lack of manures, artificial and others, the potato harvests have decreased steadidly year by year, and at present the stock held is only expected to last to the end of April.   This year&apos;s harvest is expected to be about half that of last year.In Breslau itself, a town of about 600,000 inhabitants, the rich man can still obtain a good meal at a price &apos; costing him approximately 40 mk. to 60 mk., without wine and one could live in the better hotels without realizing that there was any dangerous shortage.But, directly one visited the poorer quarters, the real situation became apparent. A large gas works has been turned into a soup kitchen, where 100,000 meals a day are cooked and issued.Three forms of so-called food are prepared, all of which we tasted :-1. A brew of spinach for children from birth to 3-4 years of age.2. A watery soup made.from mangolds, potatoes and a few carrots.   (When tasted it took all one&apos;s courage to swallow.)3. A thin stew of potatoes, turnips, carrots (sometimes), thickened with a little meal.   (This also was most unpalatable.)Thus these most unappetising and unnourishing, foods form the staple daily diet of approximately one-fifth of population.Also the local infants&apos; home was visited, where children from birth to 3-4 years old were seen. The sight of children from 3 weeks to 3 years sucking spinach soup from a bottle instead of milk was very upsetting.We were informed that the average weight of a normal new-born child was 4 lbs.Each child had a chart showing its weight from birth. For the first year, the weight gains more or less normally, but the child, at the end of third year, is really very little heavier or larger than at end of its first.The following are general remarks applicable to whole of Silesia : 1. Breslau is a fortress city and during the war had to keep large, reserves of food in case of hostile invasion.
In 1915 began the difficulties of feeding the industrial and mining population of Breslau and the surrounding towns. The first commodity to be controlled and rationed Was corn. Before the war, 60 or 70&apos; per cent, of all corn threshed was used for feeding the population, the remaining 30 or 40 per cent, being given to the cattle as fodder. At the present time, 94 per cent, of the corn harvest is used for making the food of the people, the remaining 6 per cent, being used as fodder; thus it will be seen.that a great shortage of fodder was experienced, the authorities were compelled to augment the fodder ration with an additional ration of potatoes, and, in doing so, took this food from the mouths of the population.The lack of fodder for milch cows, cattle and pigs, was the chief reason for the shortage of food for human consumption ; cows, which formerly gave about 10 litres of milk a day gradually decreased their milk output until, to-day, they are only giving from ltj to 2 litres, .So great is the shortage, that the skin and bones of the cattle are sometimes used to make sausages. Pigs have had to be killed before their time, as there simply was no food to give them.The rich agricultural districts in Poland and Galicia were cut off by the fighting, and the enormous food supplies which formerly came from these provinces were stopped.Potatoes.-As in other parts of Germany, the potato supply, owing to the extremely wet summer of last year, is practically at an end. Potatoes do not contain much nourishment, but satisfy hunger for a short time, and, as is well known, form the staple diet of the working classes in Germany. . Each person is allowed 5 lb. of potatoes a week, but, since the potatoes are of such poor quality, consumers have to take the good with the bad the weekly ration rarely amounts to more than 4 lb. Owing to lack of manure, next harvest is expected to be about half that of 1918.   *Vegetables. Vegetables, which have been very good this year, are not rationed, but it is estimated that the supply will last only another four weeks. White cabbage, of which the Silesian workmen consume vast quantities, was unfortunately not.so good as in former years.Fruit. Fruit is practically unprocurable, though in peace time it was grown to a very large extent in Silesia. Fruit of all kinds plays a very big part in the feeding of invalids and children, but, even though a little fruit is sometimes procurable, the prices are absolutely prohibitive to people of the lower classes. The shortage of manure has been the chief cause of the failure of the fruit crop.Meat. All slaughter houses are now under control of the civil authorities, as are all sausage factories. The weekly ration of meat, which is the same as elsewhere in Germany, is absolutely insignificant and can be consumed with the greatest of ease at one meal. The control of the meat supply is very vigorously carried out; every butcher has to hand over the coupons, given him by his customers the week previously, before he can have his week&apos;s meat supply. The meat itself is of poor quality and devoid of fat, which is removed and sent to the factory to be made into so-called margarine.Brewi Bread is controlled in the same way as meat by the authorities the baker having to hand over to the miller the coupons received before he can be supplied with more flour. The bread is most unwholesome and contains little or no nourishment, being composed of a little flour, potatoes, saw-dust and water. The weekly loaf is larger in size than&apos; the nourishment contained therein warrants, owing to the fact that the population judge nourishment by quantity instead of quality, and refuse to be given a smaller ration, even though they were told by their doctors that a smaller loaf would be more nutritious.Fish. Fish&apos; is not rationed, as, owing to the very small quantity supplied, it would be a physical impossibility to do so; so insignificant is the supply of fish that were it rationed, each person would receive six grammes a week.Calories. It is stated that the number of calories necessary to keep an average person going is 3,000, but, owing to the scarcity of food, each person receives only 1,250 calories a week.Hunger.  Hunger has naturally driven many people to Schleichhandel and robberies, which are of daily occurrence, though the police take every precaution to prevent them. Fines of 10,000 mk. are imposed on Schleichhandel, but appear to be rarely enforced.Indirect food supplies-It was pointed out to us that, as well as direct food supplies, the importation of cattle fodder, such as oil cake and meal, was of the greatest urgency. As soon as cattle, especially milch cows, could be properly fed, the local out-put of milk would double or even treble itself, and so very greatly relieve the children and sick, who are at present feeling the pinch of starvation more than any others.
v,;,.;-: D.-TRANSPORTATION.The general question of transport is so closely allied to the general economic situation m Germany that it. is hardly possible to report on this subject without digressing.Until the blockade is raised and raw materials begin to come in. conditions cannot improve, but must steadily become worse. There is a very great and real shortage of locomotives and rolling stock, and, owing to use of substitute materials and lack of lubricating oils, those locomotives, which are available, are constantly breaking down.The attached Tables show the situation fairly clearly : .Table 1.Breslau Railway Company.		1913.			1914.		1918.			1919.	1												October.

At present, nothing like this amount is being handled, owing to shortage of railway trucks and congestion on railways through lack of locomotives.Trucks cannot be allowed to return empty, and, at present, owing to the blockade, ho ships are coming into Stettin. If coastal shipping only were allowed to navigate, great relief would be felt, materials could be brought along the coast by ship and loaded direct on to barges at Stettin destined for Silesia. Coal could also be sent by water to Stettin, and thence along coast to various ports.N.B. There is no connection between the Eastern Canal System and the Western&apos; except by sea.E.-POLITICAL.It is necessary to preface this section of our report with the&apos; remark that political problems were really outside the sphere of our commission. We have, however, already shown in our &quot; Narrative&quot; that certain problems affecting Silesia, and with it the whole of Europe, seemed worthy of investigation whilst we were on the spot. Every facility for enquiry was given to us, and it may happen that some of our conclusions will prove valuable.In Berlin, we saw much the same state&apos; of affairs prevailing as in January-no amelioration of the food conditions, and, if anything, an increased tendency on the part of the people to give way to despair rather than to fight and go on hoping for better times. The latest Spartacist riots had been put down, thanks to Noske&apos;s good organiza-tion and the loyalty of the Government troops. Further riots were, however, regarded as inevitable, and each time, it was said, the resistance would wreaken. We heard, also, that energetic steps were being taken to bring about the disbandment of large numbers of the Government troops. The success of such an agitation would, of course, leave the Spartacists free to do anything they wished.The impression gained in Berlin was to the effect that the city is totally corrupted. If the. truth could be known, there would probably turn out to be a dozen different parties, each working in different directions. That the Ebert Government is probably not much stronger than any other.Table 4. Breslau Railway Company,
Conclusion.Here is a wonderful little province, which has fought hard all through the &quot;War and since the Armistice to keep free of evil influences. The people are order-loving, hard-working and morally sound.To-day Silesia only asks for peace and fresh air, involving :(1.^ Freedom from Polish and Czech threats of invasion, (2.) Independence from Berlin.It will not tolerate any further loss of territory, more especially in the neighbour-hood of its coalfields about Kattowitz and Waldenburg-yet it is convinced that certain annexations are being contemplated in Paris.Silesia to-day is better placed than any other province in Germany. Apart from food resources and coal, it possesses a good army. It longs for independence now that it feels unable to trust Berlin any more.Our visit to the Bohemian frontier, which is described in our &quot; Narrative&quot; convinced us that any programme of annexation, either in the &quot; Grafschaft Glatz &quot; or in the Waldenburg area would only be calculated to drive the population to Bolshevism. The whole country right up to the frontier is pure German and should be allowed to remain so.
II.-REPORT BY MAJOR THE HON. AM. BERTIE, D.S.O., M.O., ON A VISIT TO BERLIN, EAST AND WEST PRUSSIA AND CO URL AND, 17th MARCH-9th APRIL, 1919.SYNOPSIS.A. -Narrative.B.-Situation in Pomerania, East and West Prussia. C. Report on the situation in Courland (Lettland). D. Miscellaneous.A. -NARRATIVE.I arrived in Berlin on the 17th Miirch, 1919. I commenced by getting into touch with the German authorities, who were in a position to help us in our investigations on the transport problem. I then visited the Eisenbahn Ministerium and a railway repair workshop at Griinewald; we also visited the Schifffahrtsabteilung of the Feldeisenbahn Direktorat. Subsequently .1 visited Stettin, Danzig, Konigsberg, Memel and Libau between the 25th March and 5th April, when I returned to Berlin. I left Berlin for Spa on the 9 th April.While in Germany, I forwarded four reports to General Haking at Spa, which were attached to the Armistice Commissions Reports of 27th March, 1919 ; 7th April, 1919 ; 10th April, 1919, and 12th April, 1919.I attached two further reports, one on Stettin as a port for provisioning of Central Europe and a memorandum on the Baltic Barons&apos; coup d&apos;etat, in view of the political information which I gathered when at Libau and Konigsberg between 2i)th March, 1919, and 4th April, 1919, and in amplification of my report attached to General Haking&apos;s Report of 12th April, 1919.B-SITUATION IN POMERANIA, EAST AND WEST PRUSSIA.1. Food Situation.Though not specially entrusted with the study of the food conditions in Germany, I had plenty of opportunity of observing the fearful ^conditions that exist in the large towns of North Germany (Stettin, Danzig and Konigsberg), partly in connection with the investigation of the transport conditions, partly because the German authorities and people are continually bringing this question to one&apos;s notice directly or indirectly. At Stettin and Danzig, I was given the usual statistics showing the decrease of food supplies and the growth in mortality and disease, which only confirm and amplify the previous reports on the question. It must be remembered that the districts through which I travelled are food exporting provinces for the remainder of Germany, but in spite of this suffer from dire distress. I will confine myself to giving but a few facts gained from personal experience : 1. At Stettin Station, I saw several men waiting for the train with sacks of potatoes. On enquiry, I discovered that men are in the habit of coming long distances by train to buy potatoes, that it would mean bloodshed to try to stop this practice by force, that the stationmaster had attempted to stop a train loaded with such individuals and had been threatened with a revolver till he countermanded his order, that farmers were being coerced by bands of ruffians to give up their seed potatoes.
2. At Danzig, the American Commission dealing with Polish food supplies gave a small issue of bacon to the dock hands against repayment. This caused more talk and excitement than the landing of Paderewski, and has made the United States of America extremely popular.3. The skipper of the canal tug, which took me from Danzig to Konigsberg, told me that, up to 1917, he was able to get a bit extra on his tours through the country from fanners, but this.was now impossible. He had a small boy of If years, whom he was unable to feed properly. He himself looked fairly well but his eldest son (16) looked half-starved.4. A small official at Konigsberg told me that, in order to feed his three small children at all, he had to go without breakfast. He certainly had not had any breakfast that day.5. The Mayor of Stettin, who has eight children, looked a mere skeleton. I was afterwards told that his hatred for England for carrying on the blockade after the Armistice knew no bounds. He managed to remain quite civil during the interview I had with him, though he talked with great feeling about the inhumanity (Unmenschlichkeit) of the blockade.6. The workmen of the &quot; Union&quot; Locomotive Factory, Konigsberg, looked, one and all without exception, starved.7. A military railway official at Precol (junction for Libau), with whom I had breakfast, said to me : &quot; The principal reason why I have volunteered to come here is not patriotism, but because I am in a position to buy bacon, butter and eggs from the Lettish peasants and send them to my parents, who are officials in Danzig.&quot; (There is no food control in Lettland.)8. At Memel, the hotel keeper was extremely anxious about me owing to the feeling among the population against England, so the German official attached to me stated. Coal shortage in this case, however, was the chief cause of irritation. Twelve out of 15 factories were at a standstill.9. A German serjeant, late of the 55th I.E., whom I met on his way up to the Bolshevist front between Memel and Libau, said to me : &quot; I am a butcher by trade and live in the neutral zone near Duisburg. There is no cattle to slaughter, no other work for me. to do, and no food for me to eat, so I have re-enlisted for the Grenzschutz Ost, where I can get good pay, better food and opportunity of sending something to my family, provided it is not stolen on the way.&quot;10. My landlady at Konigsberg said : &quot; I do not know how I should get on if I had not a few good friends in the country who send me a bit extra now and then.&quot;Of Schleichhandel proper, that is organized buying and selling of . food without ration cards, I have found no trace. Of illicit looking after one&apos;s self through acquaintances and friends in the agricultural world, or through force, pillage and pilfering, there are abundant proofs.The. transport of provisions through Danzig for Poland is extremely unpopular for the following reasons : (1.) The Poles are generally hated.(2.) The Germans, who were in Poland before the Armistice, declare that food is,and was, far more plentiful in Poland than in Germany. (3.) Because the province of Pqsen, the granary of Germany, is no longer availablefor Germany&apos;s food stores. (4.) Because the Germans are convinced of Polish administrative inefficiency andcorruption, and say that the food will just be a means for the Jews toenrich themselves through illicit traffic.2. Blockade of the Baltic and the Coal Supply of Northern and eastern germany.According to the German version of the case, matters stand as follows: After the signing of the Armistice, the British Fleet carried out the blockade of the Baltic in a large and liberal spirit, and Admiral Browning was prepared to issue passes for coasting trade on a liberal scale. Six weeks ago, French torpedo-boat destroyers made their appearance and started a policy of rigorous blockading along the Baltic coast and in the Kiel Canal, which has resulted.in the cessation of all trade in the Baltic, including the coastal trade, and has caused a very serious coal crisis in the whole of East and West Prussia as well as the rest of Northern Germany, which is apparent to anyone who chooses to visit this country and look at the coal stores on the railway and in the factories. .....
The two main coalfields on which Germany is now dependent are the Ruhr district (Westphalia) and Silesia. The blockade of the Baltic and the absence of an East-West. Canal and the Polish demarcation line makes the transport of coal to Northern and Eastern Germany by waterway, inland or sea, impossible, and by rail circuitous. Add to this the fact that strikes in the coal districts are always on the point of breaking out or actually in progress, and it will be understood that this difficulty is a very real one. That this state of affairs is furthering Bolshevism is also quite obvious. Factories have been brought to a standstill, which not only causes additional unemployment, but also results in the stoppage or curtailment of work of high economic importance, as, for instance, here of the Union Locomotive Factory (Konigsberg), which is only turning out one-third of its normal output, in spite of preferential treatment by the railways in coal supply. Gas works and electrical works have to reduce their output, and the coal ration for domestic use has to be reduced. It is an undeniable fact that the population under its present food condition can ill afford to have additional exertions imposed on them, in the shape of walking to their work on account of the curtail-ment of the electric trams, and also that they are far more susceptible to cold than in normal times. In Danzig, I was informed that a large part of the population would shortly be at their wits&apos; end as to the means of cooking, owing to the gas shortage, unless more coal arrived soon.In addition to the above, the Baltic Blockade is causing great financial loss to individuals. One Stettin shipowner told me that he estimated his losses due to the Baltic Blockade since the Armistice at 650,000 mk, which would go on increasing till he was completely ruined. A Danzig tug and coasting shipowner told me a similar story, without mentioning actual sums.3. Economic.Allies and the Economic Boycott of German Trade.From three separate sources (one documentary and two verbal communications), I learn that the policy of economic boycott is likely to prove a complete failure.as a punitive measure against Germany, for the simple reason that the United States of America are not prepared to co-operate with the other Allies in this matter, and are, in fact, at the present moment busily engaged in various schemes for the capture of German trade for themselves as soon as the blockade is raised. Thus, a Danzig ship-owner informed me that &quot; an American Commission which recently visited Hamburg made a point of ascertaining the names of all firms on the English Black List with a view to establishing an American trade monopoly with these firms. An official in the &quot; Inland Water Transport&quot; (Binnenschifffahrtsamt) informs me that an &quot; American Chamber of Commerce &quot; has been founded in Berlin for the revival of trade between Germany and the United States of America.It is also interesting to learn from the Swedish Consul at Danzig (who is a German) that the port of Malmoe is being extended and improved in view of the increased transit trade which neutrals will enjoy after peace is signed and the Allied boycott policy has begun.My informant of the &quot;Inland Water Transport&quot; also states that Italy is about to resume trade relations with Germany,4. Political.A attitude of Sailors in Stettin and Danzig.At Stettin, I asked to see the representatives of the Sailors&apos; Union and questioned them as to the attitude of the sailors towards the handing over of the merchant fleet. Two. men presented themselves and made a statement to the following effect: . &quot;There had-been no movement among the Stettin sailors against the sailing of the food supply ships, such as had occurred in Hamburg. Of course, comparatively, few ships had sailed from Stettin, as most of the ships were of the smaller variety and only suited for navigation in the Baltic. It was, however, fully realized by themselves, personally, and the sailors that the policy of the Allies was going to ruin them. The sailors would sail out and return to Stettin to unemployment, starvation and ruin, and would probably all become Bolshevists. ,They claimed to represent 2,500 sailors and about 1,500 dockhands.&quot;At Danzig, a strike of the dockhands, employed on the unloading of the American foodstuffs for Poland, broke out while I was there. The occasion for it was a, quarrel-between an American sailor and a German workman, in the course of which the latter
was roughly handled. The strike was settled, after. 34 hours by the combined efforts of the German and American authorities,   ;, .... ,;; , ;.,&apos;&quot;   Spartacist activity in Pomerania, East and West Prussia.Though Spartacists exist in North Germany, and the danger of Bolshevism breaking out is by no means negligible, actual outbreaks have been rare. The explanation for this is to be found in the following reasons   -   .&apos;1. The proximity to the frontier of the Russian Red Army.2. The presence of a large number of refugees (Germans, Letts, Esthonians, Russians, &amp;c.) from the Balkan provinces, whose very presence impresses on ; the population the terrors of Bolshevist anarchy and the necessity of all - &apos;     anti-Bolshevist forces holding together;   . -   -  i :.3. The fact that the volunteer formations in East and. West Prussia have not been drained to supply troops for the front, such troops being .recruited in&apos;other parts of Germany. The intention is to have, as a reserve in East and West Prussia, a force which is prepared to defend the frontier with resolu-tion and vigour, should a Russian offensive or a rising of Letts and Lithua-nians make the position of the army between Riga and Kowno untenable.4. The strong-hand of the Majority Socialist, Herr Winnig, the Reichskom-. missar for the East, who does not hesitate to use force, when necessary. . .,,    . This he did with conspicuous success at the. beginning of March when the sailors in Konigsberg got out of hand,   It must not, however, be thought .j * that the prevailing conditions in North and East Germany are unfavourable to Bolshevism in other respects.   This is far from being the case..Though food exporting provinces for the rest of Germany, distress is acute in the towns at least. The serious effects of the Baltic Blockade on the coal supply of these districts have been described in a previous- report. The economic conditions may, therefore, be considered quite favourable for Bolshevism. On Sunday, the 30th March, 1919, a large meeting was held in Konigsberg, and attended by.all parties, to protest against the alleged Allied intention to drive a Polish wedge between East and West Prussia,&quot; which would separate East Prussia from the rest of Germany and deliver, it into the hands jof the Russian Bolshevists.&quot; The Independent Socialists, while joining in the protest, declared that they would not consider an invasion by Russian Bolshevists a misfortune but a blessing. The attitude of those people., who have something &quot;to lose, is one of black pessimism and intense hatred of French and Poles, whom they consider responsible for their woes. &quot; We have lost the war and you have won it, but if you persist in starving us, if you refuse to let us have raw material for our factories, and, our workmen cannot get work or food, if you take away our ships, then not only will we have lost the war but you will lose it too, and Lenin alone will win.&quot; The Bolshevist danger is so much feared that Herr v. Batocki, late Food Controller and now Oberprdsident of East Prussia, volunteered for military service as a private with the Frontier Defence Force, but was rejected on medical grounds,   , &apos; .&quot; &apos; 5. Will Germany Sign the Peace Terms ?     imt 8*5jiM*% a &amp;&amp;i...   This question does not depend so much on the nature of the peace [terms as. on the., manner in which they are framed.   A purely dictated peace the Germans,will, not,sign.. A peace which holds out definite hope of accepting Germany as a member of the League of Nations, guarantees the supply of raw materials while confiscating their mercantile : fleet, assures the right of self determination of nationalities in principle, imposes indemnities setting out in detail and moderate language the reasons for such impositions, the Germans will sign.   The cession of.Danzig to the Poles will be resisted by armed force, whether the Central Government wishes it or not.   The Commander of the. &quot;Volunteer&apos; Formations in Ednigsberg said to me in a conversation, &quot;It you attempt to cede Danzig to the Poles or land the Polish Array in Danzig, the Army and the population will&apos; resist, and if a single Pole stirs there will, be a Bartholomew massacre of Poles.   If you land them in Ednigsberg and the Central Government approves, I will keep the troops in hand, but J cannot answer for the civil -
population, especially if Polish officers and soldiers misbehave themselves in the streets or in restaurants.&quot; Another German in Danzig said : &quot; If the Poles get Danzig there will be killing and rioting, if you attempt to land the Polish Army, there will be a massacre of Poles; entraining stations, rails, &amp;c, will be wrecked by the entire German population.&quot;   &quot; If the Poles get Danzig,&quot; said another, &quot; I start the war again.&quot;6. Military.(a.) I questioned three German officers and a Serjeant on the condition of the German Army and obtained the following information : The condition of the German Army is far more serious than we imagine. The only men under arms now are the volunteer formations raised by the individual efforts of patriotic officers (Noske, however, has a scheme for regularizing the system of recruiting, which has not yet been published). Men sign on for 3 months, subject to 14 days&apos; notice on the part of the military authorities at all times, and on the man&apos;s part at end of his term. This short notice was found necessary to secure the required number of recruits, and to place the Govern-ment and military authorities in a position to comb out the ultra revolutionary elements, who might join for the purpose of carrying on propaganda of a Bolshevist nature. The result is that, as far as the Northern Corps (Libau) of the Grenzschutz Ost force is concerned, about 50 percent, of the force is permanently on its way to or from the front. The pay is extraordinarily high, viz. 300 ink a month for a private soldier. I made a point of enquiring what had happened to the three classes which would normally have been retained under arms in peace-time, and was informed that practically all had had to be disbanded as they formed the most unreliable portion of the army and the one most contaminated with Bolshevist ideas. The reasons for this being that those lads had been employed in munition factories during the war before joining the Colours, had earned high wages, becoming spendthrifts, and had generally imbibed most revolutionary ideas. They were liable to be called up at 14 days&apos; notice, but it was doubtful if they - would answer the call in the case of national emergency. Against the Entente, certainly not; against the Bolshevists (Russian), probably not; against the Poles, perhaps. Great difficulties are experienced with the men in keeping them in a contented frame of mind, and if their wishes and requirements are not complied with, mutiny or 14 days&apos; notice are the result. A mutiny actually broke out in Libau on the 3rd April, 1919, while I-was in the town. The Chief of the Staff had explained to me at a conference that morning that a mutiny was brewing in a German regiment, and that he had been compelled to ask for a regiment from the Kowno front to replace it, and that the relieving regiment had arrived. The cause of mutiny was due to the inability of the Ordnance Service to supply great-coats for this regiment owing to transport difficulties and the blockade of the Baltic coasting trade. As another instance of the transport difficulties, this same staff officer stated it had taken 36 hours to get the regiment from Kowno to Libau though the call was urgent. A statement I can well believe after my experience of the lines in Lithuania and Lettland.On the afternoon of the 3rd April, 1919, the mutinous regiment assembled, proceeded to General v. d. Goltz&apos;s Headquarters in Libau and arrested him, the loyal regiment had to be called out and succeeded in liberating their corps commander without bloodshed and arresting several rioters. The excitement was intense and the streets were still closed and picketed when I left on the morning of 4th April, 1919.Dependence on the railway for supplies had several very grave disadvantages for the German Army round Mitau. The line from Insterburg onwards is a single line, the machines are both insufficient in number and in a bad condition, stores get stolen on the way. Bolshevist agitators get into the troop trains on their way to the front and upset the men. All this could be avoided if the Baltic Sea coast traffic could be set free.From a. conversation I had with a Krupp engineer I gathered the following information which may be of interest: (a.) Long range gun on Paris. The secret of this gun lay in the excellence of the propellant used, which, though consisting of a very large charge, developed its pressure very gradually. This effect was further developed by dividing the charge into compartments which exploded a fraction of a second after the other. The stories published in the Allied Press about it being a con-crete gun were untrue. It was an ordinary steel gun mounted on rails. To prevent &quot; duds&quot; three fuzes were fixed on the shell, one fuze caused the shell-to explode at whatever angle it hit the ground.
(b.) Owing to the fat shortage, a new method was devised for obtaining glycerine from sugar, also spirits of wine from sawdust (a factory in Stettin Harbour is said to be using this process) and saltpetre from common rocksalt, the-nitrogen being obtained from the air by some special process.(c.) Krupp employed 120,000 men during the war, and had now 30,000. No labour troubles had occurred during the war or the revolution, as the workmen were very well looked after in the way of food and housing. The surplus workmen had mostly been repatriated since the Armistice to the districts from which they came at the beginning of the war. Krupps was now working chiefly for the railways.C-REPORT. ON THE SITUATION IN COURLAND (LETTLAND).i. Transport Situation.The Base for the German Army operating in Lettland is Konigsberg. From Memel onwards the line is single. There are no roads capable of bearing motor traffic or even heavy horse traffic in Courland. The Germans are anxious to make Libau into a Base and ship all supplies and reinforcements to Libau from Stettin, which of course they cannot do as long as the Baltic Blockade is maintained by us.I examined a portion of the line between Libau and Murawjewo, and was informed by the Railway Operating personnel that they only had two locomotives in operation on that line; though 10 more had been indented for, five had been sent, of which only three were at&apos; all serviceable. The railway was said to be so overcharged for its carrying capacity, that they were unable to bring up anything except the bare necessaries for the supply of the anti-Bolshevik Army. The drivers refuse to drive engines in this country at night, as attacks by marauding bands were of frequent occurrence. Circuits for horse traffic from railhead range between 18 to 70 kilometres, and in Lithuania to as much as 100.2. Military Situation. *The front of the Northern Corps extends from Schlock to the east of Mitau, as far as Baskau. The order of battle is: the Baltic Militia, consisting of 4,000 Baltic Germans, of which 2,500 are in the line, and 1,500 on the lines of communication; next come 1,100 Letts, then a company of Russians about 250 strong; the Iron Division (east of Mitau); then the 1st Guard Reserve&apos; Division (also known as the Yorck&apos;sche freiivillige Jagerkorps). The Iron Division is said to extend as far south as Sarosun, numbering 1,400 bayonets, the Guards Division 2,800. The latter suffered casualties amounting to 30 officers and 140 other ranks during the Bolshevist attack at the beginning of April. The total ration strength of the Northern Corps is, I am told, 25,000. The ration strength of people belonging to the army, or in army employ, in, Libau itself is said to be 11,000. The quality of the troops is satisfactory on the whole, but a great deal of misunderstanding and hostility exists between the Lettish troops on the one hand, and the Germans and German Baits on the other.The burning question of the present moment is that of the Lettish general mobilization.. The German attitude towards mobilization, which is supposed to be supported by the Entente, is one of frank disapproval. The German argument is as follows: We are holding the Bolshevist forces in Lettland and Lithuania by order of the Allies, and according to the terms of the Armistice of 11th November. We are quite prepared to admit that it is in our interests to keep the Bolshevist forces as far away from our frontier as possible, but a general mobilization of the Letts would place us in a very difficult position, because we are convinced that the majority of Letts are frankly Bolshevists. This is clearly proved by the fact that Lenin&apos;s best troops are Letts, and also by numerous reports from our agents. As long as we are entrusted with the defence of the Bolshevist front, it is only just that our wishes in this respect should be considered. If they are not considered, then the Allies ought to be prepared to hold the front themselves in company with the Letts, and allow us to withdraw our troops to our own frontier. At the present moment, the Entente is ordering us to resist the Bolshevists, at the same time doing all it can to make our position in Lettland impossible by rousing national feeling against the Germans in Lettland.
D-MISCELLANEOUS.1. Government Officials.All the officials, with whom we have come into contact so far, have impressed us with their efficiency and the thorough knowledge of their subject. They are ready to give all the information required.. Their, guiding idea seems to be to stick to their Work-and do their very best to pull their country safely through: the critical period through which it is now passing. . While most willing to impart information and answer, questions, it is very noticeable that they make no attempt whatever to extract information from us. The manner in which the revolution has affected the-powers of officialsjdiffers in the various departments, and,. to;;understand the present situation, it is necessary to take many facts, tendencies, &amp;c, into account. Except for. the1: uncertainty of the future, the higher officials in the purely administrative departments, e.$., railways,&apos;do&apos;not regard the revolution&apos;&apos; with:tbo rnuchdisfavour,&apos; for; the simple rea son tha t,&quot;having&apos;a superior who is not too well versed in &apos;th&apos;6 a^inratfrative&apos; and technical details&apos; of&apos; his department, they&apos; are now. in a position&apos; to carry out their work withi less interference from &quot;above than was the case in former days. In the Goyern-ment departments concerned with questions which the revolution^ has createc!^ e.g., police, a^my &amp;c.,1 the matter is different; arid,&apos;the &quot;effect of the&apos; reYolution has had the result of paralysing to a certain extent the efficiency and energy of the officials. To illustrate&apos; what I mean, the Eichhorn case is perhaps the best example that can be quoted; Eichorn, having in the November revolution been appointed to the Polizei-prdtfidium,1 set to work to undermine the police organization in the interests of the Spartacists&apos;&apos; tjll found out by &apos;the Majority Socialists :&apos;he was deposed (and. is now &quot; wanted &quot; by the Government. The police are, however; naturally adverse to showing too much keenness in the matter. After&apos; all they say to themselves :&quot; Eichhorn was Police President in November and what is to prevent him being in the same. position3. Policy of the German Government in Lettland.The intentions of the Germans on the Baltic provinces are known to us from the Treaty of Brest-Litowsk ; how far they persist is not quite clear. The following facts, however, are of interest: :The Germans lay legal claim to dispose of the ancient Crown Lands of Courland as. they ,choose, by virtue of a Convention concluded between themselves and the Lettish Government about the 14th November, 19:18, in which they, were granted the rights of the occupying military-power by the Lettish Government.   They hope to allot all the ancient Russian Crown Lands to the German,&apos;.soldiers who volunteer?for service on this front.    This intention is clearly stated by the advertisements&apos;for the YorcKsche frei-willige Jagerkorps where &quot;opportunity&quot; to settle in the Baltic.provinces,.is.voffered. As it is, half of the land, which is not Crown Land, is already in the hands of the German Baits, who form only 10 per cent, of the. population.   By allotting the Crown Lands to German soldiers for colonization, the Germans would gain possession of about two-thirds of the land,, and also materially decrease the numerical inferiority of Germans in the Baltic provinces. -. - - -,iv   &apos;&apos;    -. I think it may safely be said that the Germans would be quite prepared to evacuate-Lettland, and give up all hope of expansion in that direction, if they felt that the German landowners would be equitably indemnified.  - .      -  - ;ou.   ;       ,.&apos;m .   They are, however, convinced that the Letts have no intention of indemnifying German land-owners who have held the land for 600 or 700 years, but merely wish to expropriate them without compensation.   For this reason, th,e German. Government is most anxious that the Entente should not recognize Lettland as a Republic just yet,, and that, when the question of the Baltic provinces is solved, the solution will be one which will either allow German, expansion in that direction, or, if this is impossible, at least equitable terms for the German land-owners. . /.....; . . 1....... From documents which I was shown at Libau,-it certainly does appear as if the attitude of the Lettish Government was one of. gross intolerance. A Lett,- for publishing a newspaper article advocating a policy of reconciliation and mutual co-operation between Germans and Letts, wxas threatened with prosecution by the Lettish Government.Suggestions made to the Lettish Government by the Baltic Germans for better-understanding and co-operation are merely ignored.   &apos; &apos;    .
in a months time if fortune favours him, and what will happen to us then if we annoy him in the meanwhile.&quot; In short the officials in the State Departments dealing with fundamental questions of policy brought into prominence by the revolution do not feel that tho Government is able to give them the necessary backing. Among the minor officials, especially those who come into contact with labour, a note of hopeless despair about the future is evident.2. Policing of Berlin.The policing of Berlin is entirely in the hands of the volunteer formations, they go about the town in pairs, or larger formations, in steel helmets and armed with rifles and hand grenades. The hand grenades have their raison d&apos;Stre in the lack- of proficiency in musketry of the young soldiers. The public buildings which we have visited are all guarded by soldiers and machine guns, and it is not an uncommon thing to meet &quot; tanks &quot; in the street, some evidently captured British tanks. The old soldier is not to be seen in Berlin; it is apparently beneath his dignity to volunteer to fight the mob.- 3. General Ludendorff.General Ludendorff is staying in the Adlon Hotel in Berlin. My informants are Mr. Tower, Daily Mail correspondent and Mr. Greenwell of the Daily Express and one of the hotel waiters. Mr. Greenwell claims to have spoken to him, but states that he got no information out of him.4. Newspaper Correspondents at Weimar.The German Government allowed some British newspaper correspondents to go to. Weimar. This is interesting in view of the fact that they refused to allow British officers to go there when requested to do so by General Haking.5. Russian Prisoner of War Camps and Hospitals in Siberia.Leg. Sek Z. has had personal experience of the above, as he was wounded and spent three years in captivity in Siberia. The treatment of prisoners he described as willkiirlich, arbitrary and devoid of all system, but not harsh. The Commandant of his camp appears to have been thoroughly corrupt and consistently appropriated all money and remittances for prisoners. Now and again he would punish prisoners for making complaints. The hospital arrangements were appalling, diseases were classified as ordinary and infectious. All infectious cases were herded together with the result that if you went to hospital with scarlet fever you stood a good chance of contracting measles and spotted fever from your next-door neighbour and dying of combined infectious diseases.   Prisoners had a dread of being sent to hospital.6. Socialists and Foreign Policy.In reply to a question which I put to the Commissioner of the Central Government for the East and Occupied Territory of Russia, as to why the Socialist party had exercised so little restraint on the absurd foreign policy of the Kaiser and his Ministers before, he replied that the Socialist party had concentrated practically their entire attention on social and economic problems and had left foreign policy severely alone. This was forcibly brought home to him when he attended an International Socialist Meeting in Paris shortly before the War. On that occasion, he noticed that the French Socialist knew far more about foreign policy than the German Socialists, while the German Socialists were far better acquainted with social problems than the French-even French Social problems. He remembered at the time wondering whether it would not be- a good thing for the German Socialists to take a little more interest in foreign affairs. There was not a man living in Germany to-day who did not consider the pre-war foreign policy of Germany as hopelessly wrong-headed.7. German and Russian Poles.The Director of the Inland Water Transport in Germany, said to me on 9th April, 1919: &quot;It is not sufficiently realized that there is a fundamental
difference between the German and Russian Poles in their attitude towards Germany. No one sees this more than I do in ray dealings with them. In sending goods to Poland I can always rely on reasonable co-operation between the German authorities and the Russian Poles, but never with the German Poles, who always put every impediment in the way of returning barges and interfering with transit, even in German territory. *,8. Liaison with German Water Transport Department.The chief of the above department, whose headquarters are at Kronprinzen Ufer 19, Berlin, said he would very much appreciate an Entente liaison organization with his department. His department was concerned in all matters of transport, such as Russian prisoners, food for Germany and the rest of Central Europe, repatriation of prisoners of war (Allied and Germans, raw material, &amp;c).
III. (a).-INTERIM REPORT ON A VISIT TO BAVARIA BY LIEUTENANT G. H. BEYFUS (30th MARCH TO 8th APRIL, 1919).Captain Broad, Lieutenant Wareing and I arrived at Wurzburg on 31st March, Lieutenant Wareing left for Munich the following day. Captain Broad and I remained at Wurzburg till Thursday, 3rd April, and then proceeded to Nurnberg. At both places the German authorities, civil and military, placed all the information for which we asked at our disposal. On 7th April, I received a telephonic message from Lieutenant Harding from Berlin, that he wished to hear the latest details with regard to the position in Bavaria. I accordingly came to Berlin yesterday, and am taking the opportunity of the courier service to make this Interim Report; Captain Broad, I know, shares the opinions expressed herein.Food Supplies.Both at Wurzburg and Ntirnberg, the scale of rations remains nearly the same as that of last November, with two important exceptions.Last November the ration at Wurzburg was 14 kilos, of potatoes per month, it is now 10 kilos., though it is uncertain whether supplies will be available to give the full ration. The fat ration has diminished from 75 grs. to 62 grs. per week. There has been a rise on the other hand in the bread ration from 7 kilos. 100 grs. per month to 8 kilos. 850 grs. per month.At Nurnberg, the fat ration has remained the same (62 grs. per week), but there has been a serious fall in the potato ration from. 6 lbs. per week (with an additional 3 lbs. for the poorer classes and those engaged in heavy manual labour) to a nominal ration of 4 lbs. per week. It has, however, not been possible to give more than 2 lbs. per week during the last two weeks, nor has it been possible to give any increase in other rations in compensation. The town has actually no stock of potatoes, but depends on weekly supplies. It needs 8,000 centners weekly for a distribution of 4 lbs. per head, and on Monday (7 th instant) had already received 1,000 centners. The officials hoped this week they might be able to supply the full ration. The nominal ration of meat at Wurzburg was 275 grs. weekly for the last 4 weeks, but they have no supplies in hand and depend on what they can obtain from the surrounding country. During the last 4 weeks they were only able to distribute 780 grs. in-all, instead of the full ration of 1,100 grs.At Nurnberg, the meat ration is 150 &apos;grs. &apos; (including bones) and 100 grs. sausage per week. The town has supplies up to 15th April. Full details and tables as to rations will be annexed to the detailed report. The rations are, in our opinion, undoubtedly insufficient to maintain the people in health, and the length of time, during which they have lived on such rations, has undoubtedly told on them both morally and physically. The most pressing need is for fats; then for potatoes (at Nurnberg particularly), meat and milk..The organization for the distribution of food appears to us efficient. The illicit trading, which enables restaurants to supply more or less plentiful meals, is done directly with the farmers, and so far all efforts appear to have failed to put a stop to it. But we have little doubt that the food under the control of the city authorities is fairly distributed, and that any food supplies sent by the Allied Governments can safely be entrusted to them for distribution.Clothing..The lack of clothing is almost as serious as that of food, and must be regarded as an important contributory factor to the prevailing unrest. Prices have risen by 1,000 per cent, and more, while materials themselves are of the very poorest quality. Paper materials are much used, and are from three to ten times the price of the woollen materials sold before the war. A comparative table of prices will be found in the detailed report.   There is a similar lack of boots and shoes, though for men the
position has been a little improved lately by the release of military stocks. Wool, cotton, linen, thread and leather&quot;are urgently needed to cover the barest necessities of the people.Transport.We have not yet had time to examine the transport question at Nurnberg. At Wurzburg, it was alleged that full use could not be made of the.&apos;Rhine and the Main owing to the confiscation of the cargoes en route by British, American and French officers, which made owners reluctant to use this means of transport, although there was an ample supply of barges and tugs available.The wish was expressed that goods intended for South Germany should be sent to Rotterdam and not to a North German port.The greatest difficulty with regard to railway transport appears to be the number of engines in need of repair, and the difficulty of repairing owing to lack of iron. The lack of engines appears to have been met chiefly by the redaction in the number of passenger trains, while goods trains have only diminished from 159 in August, 1914, to 136 at the present time.Other raw materials particularly needed are lubricating oil, copper and asbestos.Military Situation.The troops, both in, the II and III Bavarian Army Corps, appear to be in a thoroughly demoralized state. They have little or no discipline, and are quite untrust-worthy.Those at Wurzburg appeared to us in a worse state than those at Nurnberg. Few officers wore uniforms. Only the Sicherheitskompagnie (about 300 strong) were armed for security, while there were some 5,000 to 6,000 living and being fed in barracks in order that they might not be thrown as unemployed upon the streets and add to the forces of disorder. lV%The same applies to Nurnberg, where the number of semi-demobilized amounts to 20,000, according to the information given to us. The Sicherheits troops at Nurnberg amount at most to 2,000 men. The figures set out above were given to us at the respective headquarters in Wurzburg and Nurnberg, and we have not been able to check them, but we do not think there can be any doubt .as to the hopeless state of moral and total lack of discipline among all except the Sicherheitstruppen, and . even these were not regarded as trustworthy by the authorities.Political Conditions.The position both at Wurzburg and Nurnberg is critical. On Sunday the Raterepublik was proclaimed at Munich. Monday morning there was great anxiety at Nurnberg in official circles, but the situation was momentarily eased by the rejection of a motion in favour of the Rciterepublik by the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of Nurnberg by a majority of 138 to 70. However, there was great activity that night at the General Kommando, which was already fortified with barbed wire, sandbag barricades, machine guns, &amp;c, when we arrived in Nurnberg. Yesterday morning, however, the position -was again considered most critical by the authorities. Martial law had been proclaimed, cavalry patrolled the streets, the Rathaus was closed except for one side door, which was strongly guarded. I saw the Biirgermeister yesterday morning, (8th April, 10 a.m.) before leaving for Berlin, and he informed me that some of the troops (Sicherheitstruppen) had refused service, and that he might have to resign within a few hours. I have spoken to Captain Broad at Nurnberg over the telephone to-day (9th April, 2 a.m.) and he informed me that the situation there remains unchanged, though still dangerous.The greatest danger lies in the fact that the nerves of the German people appear to have broken down. A people of little political understanding, they imagined, when the Armistice was signed, that peace was immediately at hand and that the privations1 of 4^ years were over. Five months have passed and their exaggerated hopes of a speedy peace, of quick supplies of food and clothing, hopes unduly encouraged by a somewhat reckless Press, have been disappointed. Hope deferred has made the German heart sick. From the heights of hope of last November and, in spite of the disaster that had overtaken them, the Armistice was hailed with genuine joy in Germany they have plunged into the depths of despair. And it is this despair which has given Bolshevism its chance. Russian agents are undoubtedly at work, and their German comrades are promising ample food supplies from Hungary, Roumania and Russia, and the German people, despairing of help from the West, are turning their eyes to the
East. The Hoffmann Government in its latest proclamation finds itself compelled to denounce the &quot;criminal folly&quot; of those who are promising supplies from Russia and Roumania, where the famine is far worse than in Germany, and to hold out the prospect of food supplies from the West within the next few weeks.. But it is doubtful whether words are any longer of avail. The Germans have read so much and heard so much of the promised food supplies that they no longer believe in thern. It is only the actual arrival and distribution of food which will allay their doubts. It appears to us to be the sincere opinion of most of those with whom we have spoken (and to be confirmed by the conversations we have overheard, e.g., while travelling) that the arrival of adequate supplies will check the wave of unrest and the movement towards Bolshevist chaos which is undoubtedly making great strides at the moment. We are by no means sure that this opinion is not over optimistic and that those who have told us &quot; you have come too late &quot; are not right. But we are satisfied that the arrival of adequate supplies without delay is the one &quot;hope of saving the country from lapsing into chaos.The question of price, however, will be important in considering how far the arrival of food supplies will restore quiet and order to the country and also in considering whether they &quot; will reach those who are most in need of it.&quot; We were informed at Nurnberg, for example, by a high official of the local Food Control Office that the price of the potatoes coming from England would work out at 50 pf. a pound while the official maximum price at Nurnberg at present is 11 pf. This was due principally, he thought, to the rate of exchange. Whatever the reason, in so far as food supplies are regarded as a weapon against Bolshevism, the question of price, as well as the adequacy of the supply, must be carefully considered.The attitude of Nurnberg may well decide the success or failure of the Bolshevist movement in Bavaria, and the position in Nurnberg appeared; to Captain&apos; BrOad and myself yesterday morning to be critical. We therefore decided that T should suggest to General Ewart that Major Sherman of the American Army, who is at present at Nurnberg in charge of the Allied supplies for Russian prisoners of war, should be given discretionary power to arrange with the German authorities that they should have some of the spare supplies of bacon and ham in his charge at Nurnberg on terms of repayment later, if it appeared to him desirable. There are over 100,000 pounds of bacon and ham lying at Nurnberg now, and if the authorities at Nurnberg are able&apos;to double the&apos; fat ration this week with the help of supplies obtained from the Allied Governments, the moral effect might just turn the scale. I understand that General Ewart is endeavouring to give effect to this suggestion. &apos;   1 &apos;&quot; : &apos;(Signed)  GILBERT H. BEYFUS, Lieut.,3rd Bn.

Beyfus and Lieutenant E. A. Wareing left Cologne on 30th March for Bavaria, arriving that evening at Frankfurt a/M.We left Frankfurt next morning, 31st March, for Wurzburg, arriving the same afternoon. The next day Lieutenant Wareing left for Munich, while Captain Broad and Lieutenant Beyfus remained at Wurzburg until 3rd April.During our stay we had several conferences with Oberburgermeister Dr. A., .also at the General Kommando with Major B., Generalstabschef; and afterwards with Major C. of the Commissariat Department, who took us round the military dep6ts. We also inspected the town food depots, met the leading business men and interviewed the President of the administration of the Wurzburg railway area. We visited the printing press works of Messrs. Konig and Bauer, where trucks are repaired, and received a deputation from their workmen. We inspected the &quot;Peoples&apos; Kitchens &quot; and visited several workmen&apos;s houses during their dinner hour.On the afternoon of 3rd April, we left for nurnberg, where we stayed until the 14th instant. On the 8th, Lieutenant Beyfus went to Berlin to report to Lieutenant Harding and make out an interim report, returning to Nurnberg the evening of the 10th.While at Nurnberg, we had several interviews with Oberburgermeister Dr. A.; met Rechtsrat, Dr. D. of the Food Control Office, and studied the food conditions with him ; enquired into and received information re military stores from Lieutenant E. at the General Kommando; studied the transport question with the President of the administration of the Nurnberg railway area and visited the State repairing shops for rolling stock ; enquired into the lack of raw materials ; went over a boot factory and the Maschinenfabrih Augsburg-nurnberg, where engines and trucks are also repaired, and received a deputation from the workmen. We inspected food warehouses, the milk distributing centre, people&apos;s kitchen and workmens houses during the dinner hour.On the 14th April, we left Nurnberg for Regensburg, remaining there until the 20th instant.We met the Oberburgermeister; studied the food question with Rechtsrat Dr. F. of the Food Control Office, who took us round the slaughter house and peoples&apos; kitchen, called at the General Kommando and saw Lieut.-Colonel G., and received information from the Commissariat Department and inspected the military food depdts. We had interviews with Dr. H. of the Oberbayerischer Bauernverein and the President of the administration of the Regensburg railway area.We drove round the country ascertaining the present conditions of the winter crops, and had an interview with the Bilrgermeister of Worth.On the evening of the 20th, we returned to Nurnberg ; the next day we had an interview with Cu.pt. J., assistant to Major K., Generalstabschef, and cleared up some points on which we had been misinformed.
We intended leaving the same afternoon for Aschaffenburg on our way to Cologne, but had to wait for Major L. of the Bavarian Army, who had telephoned us from Augsburg, saying he had important information and wished to see us.The next afternoon we caught the only train leaving Nurnberg for Aschaffenburg, where we found the German authorities had provided a special to take us on to Mainz where we had to stay the night.We left Mainz the next morning, the 23rd instant, and arrived in Cologne the same afternoon.2. ECONOMIC.A. Food Conditions.We are of opinion that the scale of rations existing at the present time at Wurzburg, Nurnberg and Regensburg, is insufficient to maintain the people in ordinary health, and we think that the shortage of food is a serious menace to the country. We have dealt further with this question under the heading &quot; Political.&quot; We append a table showing the scale of rations existing in Wurzburg, Nurnberg and Regensburg, in November, 1918, and April, 1919, respectively, and a table showing the distribution of milk in the above-mentioned towns at the present time. The supplies of the various staple articles vary in the different towns.Wurzburg. Wiirzburg has supplies with which to continue the bread ration for six weeks (from 2nd April) and potatoes and cereals for four weeks (from 2nd April). The provision of fat, meat, milk, cheese and eggs, is dependent on weekly supplies from the surrounding country. These supplies are problematic each week and the full ration cannot always be given : See, e.g., the note on the meat ration in Wurzburg in the table appended.The military authorities have, at the present ration strength, a bread supply for one month, a supply of potatoes-for six wTeeks and sugar for two months. About the middle of March, they handed over 1,200 tons of rye flour to the civil authorities for the civil population of the II Army Corps, which includes the occupied territory of the Palatinate. &quot;nurnberg. Nurnberg has sufficient supplies to continue the bread and flour ration until the end of May, the ration of cereals for two months, and the sugar ration for four weeks. Sugar has been so scarce that the Nurnberg authorities have been unable to give out supplies for preserving as has been done hitherto. The provision of potatoes, fat, meat, milk, cheese and eggs, is dependent on weekly supplies from the surrounding country. The position with regard to milk is explained in the table appended. The supplies of potatoes, meat and fat are particularly doubtful each week. In January, 1919, no potatoes at all were available for four weeks ; from 23rd March to 5th April,-only 2 lbs. per week could be distributed instead of the already - reduced nominal ration of 4 lbs. and no substitute was available. 400 tons weekly are needed to give the nominal ration, and the municipal authorities do not expect to be able to get any supplies after the end of May. Fat is increasingly difficult to procure and the meat supplied steadily deteriorates in quality.The military authorities at Nurnberg have supplies for three months at their present ration strength. They allege that they have already handed over 50 per cent, of their stores to the civil population.Regensburg. Regensburg can continue the present ration of bread, flour and potatoes until the beginning of June. The provision of fat, meat, milk, cheese and eggs is dependent on the weekly supplies from the surrounding country. It has only been possible during recent weeks to obtain sufficient fresh meat to supply 150 grs. weekly; to make up the nominal ration of 200 grs., 50 grs. of pickled meat (Pokelfleisch) have been given. The supply of pickled meat 20 tons-had been obtained from the local military authorities and will be exhausted in two weeks. There remain 10 tons of tinned meat (also obtained from the military authorities), which will enable this supplementary ration of 50 grs. to be continued for about 2^-weeks more. ,Regensburg needs 350 tons of rye flour monthly; to meet its needs for June 100 tons have been allotted from Munich and 20 by the local military authorities. The latter have also promised 10 tons of cereals (peeled barley, &amp;c), 8 tons of tinned meat, 5 tons of beans, and lton of dried fruits, subject to the consent of the III Army Corps Headquarters. It is becoming increasingly difficult to supply the weekly fat ration. For the week 6th   13th April only 31 grs. could be supplied instead of the nominal ration of 62. The military authorities have at their present ration strength supplies for about three months.
So far as. we can judge, the military authorities are doing their best to assist the civil population, and, especially in view of the formation of the new forces (Volkswehr and Freiwilligenhorps) for the purpose of crushing the Bolshevist movement at Munich, , it appears to us unlikely that they will be able to spare much more.A comparison of civilian and military weekly rations at Nurnberg in staple articles is as follows : -	Civilian.

Morning coffee., The quality of the bread, meat, potatoes and fat supplied is extremely bad. The bread is made of rye flour (ground, 94 per cent.), barley and potato flour. It is unpleasant to eat and hard to digest. The meat is even worse. We visited the municipal slaughterhouse at Regensburg and saw the cattle brought in. They consisted principally of one and two year old steers and heifers, undersized, and in the poorest condition. We also saw similar animals being driven to the slaughterhouse at Wurzburg. At the Peopled Kitchens (Volhshiichen) we were told that it now takes 90 100 grs. of the meat (uncooked with bones) to produce 40 grs. of cooked meat.In one building at Regensburg, there were hanging no less than 34 carcases of tuberculous animals ; the parts not dangerous for human consumption were sold coupon fr^e.,;..       :        ,v: ; ,    .,:!.-f,.;.\ ,;: -i.;:,;v:... ., ,The potatoes were to a large extent of poor-quality, many of them having been affected by the frost during transport. The fat supplied consisted chiefly of margarine only fit to be used for cooking purposes.The three towns we visited have all established.Peopled Kitchens (VolksMchen).Wurzburg. Wurzburg has one which serves some 1,200 meals a day, 800 on the premises and 400 being fetched for consumption at home. The price is 3&apos;60mk. for the week, no meals being served on Sundays. The food provided on the day of our visit was soup (made of peeled barley) followed by mashed potatoes and Sauerkraut.... Nurnberg. Nurnberg has three, which supply 8,000 meals daily both on and off the premises. We visited the largest which supplies 3,000 daily. The price is 3&apos;00 mk. for the; week; no meals being supplied on Sundays. The food provided on the day of our visit consisted of bean soup and a sort of porridge made of peeled barley and condensed skim milk with a spoonful of jam. The kitchens appear to he patronized by all classes, and we were informed that a General had seven portions daily-fetched ,for himself and his family   Meat (50 grs.) was supplied twice weekly, j. ,. v, ...- &apos; Regensburg. Regensburg hasfour, which supply 4,000-5,000 daily-both on and off the premises. The price is 50 pf. Meat (30 grs.) is supplied five days a week. The kitchen we visited supplied 1,200 1,400 daily. The day of our visit was a meatless day. The food; consisted of potato soup and dumplings (made of barley flour) with Sauerkraut. ; The same food was supplied at the increased price of 60 pf. in a neigh-bouring cafe which had been turned into a sort of annexe; it was somewhat better served here and beer could be bought.   .   . ,       ,   i .In all three towns, coupons were necessary for meat, potatoes, &amp;c. for the dumplings at Regensburg, bread coupons had to be given. We tasted the food at all three kitchens, and at all of them we had the same impression. The food was well cooked and filling, but seemed to have little sustaining value. All three towns, we were told, lose money on the kitchens.We append a table showing the prices of food and necessaries at Nurnberg in November, 1918, and April, 1919.The system of control by food cards is the same as that employed during the war. It&apos; appears to us efficient in the distribution of food. It has, however, been unable to put a stop to illicit trading, though the measures against it have been sharpened under
the Hoffmann Government. All hand luggage was searched for food on the train on which Lieutenant Beyfus travelled to Berlin. In a land of peasant farmers, however, the difficulty of control is intensified, and, in consequence, good meals can be obtained at a high price at hotels and restaurants,&apos;though, even there, white bread, butter and full milk are unobtainable.We have dealt to some extent with the attitude of the civilian population under the heading &quot; Political.&quot; The police forces in Wurzburg, nurnberg and Regensburg are all reliable and we think that the Sicherheitstruppen (see under the heading &quot;Military&quot;) can be relied on to some extent to maintain public order, where political controversy is not involved. The only case of looting which has taken place in any of the three above-mentioned towns was the looting of clothes shops at Regensburg last January by demobilized soldiers, who had not been given civilian clothes. There has, on the other hand, been no looting of food, although, to the knowledge of the population, supplies for the Russian prisoners of war have been stored at Nurnberg for some time. However, a few minor thefts from the stores for the Russians have taken place, and, in the case of the first supplies arriving, we think a certain amount of theft must be reckoned with. In the case of political disturbances, of course the whole supplies would be seriously endangered.To sum up, we are convinced that food supplies are urgently needed. The present rations can probably be continued until&apos;the end of May (though the supply of the fat ration even so long is doubtful), but we are of opinion that the present rations are insufficient and that the long continued insufficiency of food has had, and is having, a most demoralizing effect on the people. First and foremost fats are needed; then meat, milk, potatoes and flour. From the political point of view, which we discuss&apos; below, we think that these supplies should be sent with the utmost promptitude.To ensure the supplies reaching those who are most in need of them, we think that they should only be sent subject to the condition that they should be distributed by, or under the control of, the Local Food Control offices (Lebensmittelcimte).Comparison between scale of weekly rations, November, 1918 April, 1919.	wurzburg.		nurnberg.		begensburg.		nov., 1918.	april, 1919.	nov., 1918.	april, 1919.	nov., 1918.	april, 1919.bread ..      ... white flour	1,775 grams. .125    ,,	2,212 grams. 125	1,500 grams. 200    ,,	1,500 grams. 200    ,,	1,525 grams. &apos; 375    ,,	1,875 grams. 375    ,,potatoes meat, including sausages or tinned	7 lbs. . 213 grams.	5 lbs. f 275 grxiris;	*6 lbs. i 225 grams.	4 lbs. 250 grams.	7 lbs. 180 grams.	a its. 200 grams.-meat. &quot;&apos; eggs .. sugar .. peeled barley... macaroni     .,      .. flaked oats ... substitute coffee cheese        .. artificial honey	62-5    ,, 1 187 grams. 62 .,, m 9 - 31 grams. 60    ,, 62    ,,	62-5 ,,   . 1 156 grams. 187   .,, 31 31 31 80        . 125    ,,	62-5 ,, 1 175 grams. jl25 125    ,, 100    ,, 62   &apos;,,	62-5 ,, 1 175 grams. 125 s125    ,, 100 * * 250 grams.	62-5 1 175 grams. 31    ,, 125    ,, 75    ,, 125    ,, t 4	$62-2 ,, 1 175 grams. * * 125 grams. 75    ,, for 10 days. 125 grams.* in nurnberg, during november, 1918, the poorer classes and heavy manual labourers drew an extra. 3 lbs. potatoes per week..&apos; during the two weeks preceding .8th april, it was only possible to give 2 lbs. per week, nor was it possible to increase other rations in compensation.f at wurzburg, during the four the weeks preceding 8th, april it was only possible to distribute 780 grs. of meat in all, instead of the full ration of 1,l00 grs.% at regensburg, the officials were only able to distribute si grs. of fat for the week 6th-13th april. at nurnberg,&apos; owing to the release of military supplies, the authorities have been able to distribute 50 grs. real coffee per head per week.by giving up the weekly cheese coupons, children up to two years are allowed an extra 125 grs. flaked oats,* &quot;5&quot; a  sugar,.   - l ,  /...;&apos;/and for six bread coupons (300 grs.) they may draw 300 grs. zioiebach (biscuits).the supply of sea fish is negligible, e.g., at wurzburg, every three months, two persons receive one&apos; herring between them.roughly speaking, 30 grs. s 1 ounce.

Cloth tng.We have not the slightest doubt that there is the most serious shortage of clothing, linen and boots, and we believe that this shortage is almost as great a source of dissatisfaction as the shortage of food. Both the Workmen&apos;s Committees, whom we saw, were emphatic on this point. It is not merely a question of the high prices, although prices have risen by 1,000 per cent, and more ; it is the absolute lack of these articles and the extremely poor quality of the substitutes which is so serious. Clothes made of genuine wool, underclothing of wool, cotton or linen, are to be had at fancy prices only. And the substitutes, of paper and cotton waste principally, are of such poor quality that the people only bay them now when compelled to do so by sheer necessity. Prices for these substitutes have risen in one or two instances since the Armistice, but on the whole are substantially the same as at that date. There were no clothing factories at any of the towns we visited. But at Wurzburg we saw a manufacturer of underclothing, who employed some 100 hands. He showed us samples of the underclothing manufactured by him of paper, cotton waste, &amp;c. The quality was wretched in spite of the prices being some ten times the prices prevailing before the war. A visit to any shop confirmed the fact that goods of this class were the only ones substantially available. He only continued now to manufacture these goods, be assured us, to keep his employees in work. Cotton, above all, then wool, flax and thread, are urgently needed. With regard to boots, the position with regard to men&apos;s boots has been eased at Nurnberg by the military authorities releasing the greater part of their stocks (140,270 pairs) for the use of the civil population. These boots were to be sold at cost price with a small profit to the shopkeeper. We saw some pairs for sale in a shop marked at 39.60. We visited Factory No. 2 of the Vereinigte Frankische Schuhfabriken at Nurnberg. This factory employs some 500 hands. The company owns three other factories, one of which, employing 800 hands, is also at Nurnberg. The factory we visited turned out daily some 400-500 pairs of box-calf boots with paper linings at 48&quot;00 mk. per pair, but a special permit (Bezugschein) was necessary to buy them. It had leather enough to continue this supply for two months. It also turned out daily 600-800 pairs of &quot; War Boots &quot; at 36&apos;00 mk. per pair. These boots had wooden soles, heels of leather and cardboard, paper uppers and lining, and toecaps and sides of box-calf. To buy these no permit was necessary. -The other factory at Nurnberg was almost exclusively employed in manufacturing these &quot; War Boots.&quot;On the whole, the position as regards boots is not so urgent as the question of underclothing and linen generally, but there is no doubt as to the very serious lack of boots and the consequent need for leather.As the factories and workshops are manufacturing these substitute articles, there cannot be any doubt, we think, that, if the raw materials for manufacture arrive, the labour will be available. Their evidence is probably not of much value, but none of the manufacturers or business men we met appeared to have any doubts on this point.(7)32) 0
0. Raw Materials.The most critical point in the economic state of Bavaria is the lack of coal. The seriousness of the position is best illustrated by its effect on the railways, which are dealt with under the heading &quot; Transport,&quot; Before the war, Bavaria obtained her coal supplies chiefly from Saarbrlicken, the Ruhr district and Bohemia. All the Bavarians we have met realize that France, with her own coalfields destroyed, must be supplied from Saarbruckeii, and do not expect supplies from that quarter. Their main remedy is &quot; Send ample food supplies to the Ruhr district,&quot; so convinced are they that under-nourishment is the root of all the unrest in that district. Before the war, Bohemia exported some 1\ million tons to Bavaria yearly. The Bohemian coalfields lie close to the Bavarian frontier, and are most conveniently suited for supplying Bavaria. The supply has not entirely stopped, as some 50 to 100 wagons arrive from time to time, but Bohemia has ceased to be a serious source of supply. We were unable to ascertain the reason for this; even the President of the Regensburg Railway area, which includes the Bavarian-Bohemian frontier, could not tell us. But it appears to us, especially in view of the present critical position, political as well as economical, that it would be of the greatest value if the difficulties, whatever they may be, could be overcome, and the regular export of coal from Bohemia1 could be resumed.Apart from coal, the raw materials most needed appear to be cotton, wool, flax, yarn, leather, copper, iron, asbestos, nickel, tin, antimony, lead, rubber, lubricating oils, petrol, paraffin, varnish, shellac and paints. We have dealt with some of these materials under the heading &quot; Clothing and Transport.&quot;As regards iron, the chief difficulty is lack of ore; the Siegen iron ore, we are informed, needs to be mixed with the higher grade. Spanish and Swedish ores. The Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg, employing 5,000 to 6,000 men, used before the war to obtain the pig iron from Lorraine and Luxemburg, and its wrought iron from the Saar district. They had sufficient pig iron for carrying on repairs to rolling stock for a fortnight only. Wrought iron was needed for new construction, and, if the manager is to be believed, the Westphalian Works did not manufacture the sizes they needed, and would have to change their methods of manufacture before they could do so. It is perhaps worthy of note that this manager said to us, &quot; Don&apos;t bother so much about raw materials; send food. We can keep our men employed ; that is only a question of money.   But food-that we cannot give them.&quot;So far as we can judge, apart from the textiles and leather, lubricating oils above all, and then copper, rubber and asbestos, are the most urgently needed.D.-Wages and Unemployment.. By a decree of the Reichsamt of 23rd November, 1918, daily working hours of artisans were reduced to eight, while total wages for the day remained the same. As ten hours had previously been the average working day, this was an equivalent to an increase of 25 per cent, on all wages.But apart from this, wages have risen considerably since the Armistice. We append a table prepared for us by the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg of the wages paid by them in November, 1918, and April, 1919, respectively.We also obtained a list of the actual wages paid by the Vereinigte Frankische Schuhjabriken to their employees in November, 1918, and March, 1919, respectively. From this it appears that, exceptional cases apart, the range of weekly earnings in marks was as follows : -	November, 1918.	March, 1919.	From	from men over 21      ......	60-110	80-120Boys under 18......	40-70	55-79Women over 21  ..	40-60	55-80Girls under 21......	82-56	36-60Military bakers at Wurzburg, who received 40 marks for a working week of 48 hours in November, 1918, were receiving 92 marks for a working week of 36 hours in April, 1919.To assess the amount of unemployment, it is necessary to take into account, not only those receiving unemployment pay from the civil authorities, but also the
demobilization troops (Demobilmachimgstruppen) who are merely lodged and fed in barracks to keep them from swelling the number of unemployed. This benefit of free food and lodging and 1 mk a day pay ceases in the event of a man refusing work which has been found for him.   &apos;The figures given to us are as follows : 	Civil	Demobilization	unemployed.	troops.Wurzburg        ..      ..	200	1,500-2,000N tirnberg (population, 370,000)	13,000	3,000-4,000*Begensburg     ..      ........	390	About 700N.B.

Transport.The Bavarian railway system (apart from the Palatinate) is divided into five areas : of these, we visited the centres of the three areas which lie, roughly speaking, north of the Danube, viz., Wurzburg, nurnberg and Regensburg.From the information and figures compiled for us by the Presidents of the Railway Administration of these three areas, we have compiled the three tables appended to this report : The lack of engines and wagons is alleged to be due to (a.) The obligation to deliver engines and wagons to the Entente Governmentsunder the terms of the Armistice. (&amp;.) Losses on the Eastern fronts, (c.) Delayed repairs owing to the war.(d.) Shorter running life of both engines and wagons owing-to inferior materials (iron, for example, as a substitute for copper removed from engines to be used in the manufacture of munitions, lack of lubricating oil, &amp;c).(e.) Lack of raw materials for executing repairs.The situation, as will be seen from the tables, has been met by reducing the passenger service as much as possible in favour of the goods service. Apart from the cpiestion of coal supplies, the Bavarian railway authorities consider that they can cope with the carriage and distribution of food supplies.There are no repair shops at Wurzburg, but we visited Konig and Bauer&apos;s Printing. Press Factory there, at which some 20 wagons were being repaired; more rails were
repair, 230 Goods wagons, 1,20810 81 22 68 129 670being laid down on a vacant plot adjoining the factory, to enable more wagons to be repaired. At nurnberg, we visited the two State repair shops. 500 wagons were in course of repair there, and some 45 were finished weekly. There were 42 engine stalls and 59 engines awaiting repairs, 13 to 14 were delivered on an average monthly. The Maschinenfabrih Augsburg-Nurnberg was also engaged in repairing wagons and engines. At the time of our visit, there were 12 engines and some 70 wagons in course of repair; engines took on an average 8 to 10 weeks, wagons 1 to 3 weeks to repair. This was new work undertaken by the firm since the Armistice only.At Kegensburg we were supplied with the following figures with regard to the rolling stock under repairs in the Eegensburg area on 15th April.Average weekly deliveries : TP-        i        -   nr, f(a.)

The most important locomotive works are those of Maifei at Munich, where there has been a general strike since 14th April.There is an undoubted lack of raw materials both for the purpose of repairs and to keep the rolling stock at present in use in good repair. Lubricating oil, copper and rubber are the most urgently needed; then iron, varnish, tin, asbestos, leather and cotton waste (as a substitute for which at the moment thin wood shavings are being employed).On our arrival at&apos; Wurzburg on 2nd April, the supplies of coal were already very short. Wurzburg had three days&apos; supply, Aschaffenburg five, and Schweinfurt four. But the service, though restricted, was most efficient, the trains keeping remarkably good time. At the time of our departure from Bavaria on 22nd April, the position as regards coal supplies was critical. All. passenger trains to Frankfurt-am-Main had been suspended in order to enable the goods service to be kept up and the city to be provisioned. We were only able to travel beyond Aschaffenburg by the aid of a special train to Mainz which the Bavarian Government had ordered for us. In Bavaria, all express trains had been suspended; only very few slow trains were running, and the warning had been given that it might be necessary in a few days to suspend the whole of the passenger service throughout Bavaria.For the supply of Bavaria with food and raw materials, the best route is probably by the Rhine from Rotterdam to Mannheim, or, for Northern Bavaria, by the Rhine and Main to Wurzburg and Bamberg.Number of Trains in Wurzburg, Nurnberg and Regensburg Areas on 1st August, 1914, 1st October, 1918, and.1st April, 1919.

Agriculture.So far as we can judge, and from the information we have received, autumn-sown crops seem to have wintered well. The general opinion, however, is that, with average weather, the yield will be inferior to that of last year. Dr. H. estimates that they will yield about 20 per cent. less. This he&apos;puts down to the lack of artificial manures, which is due to (a.) Difficulties of transport from the ruhr district. (6.) Lack of coal.(c.) The holding back of OhlorJcalium, with which to pay in part for food supplies.(d.) With regard to Thomasmehl, the confusion of the railways last October and November, and the subsequent prohibition of trade with the Occupied Territory.The Oberbayerische Bauernverein, which obtained its Thomasmehl from Eachling, Thomas Stahlwerke, Valklingen on the Saar, has by reason of the two causes above-. mentioned only received 39 per cent, of the amount received last year.   He is most anxious that this trade at any rate should be permitted.The Spring -sowing is extremely late owing to the wet weather. There is some shortage of seed potatoes. The seed potatoes expected at Nurnberg from Posen cannot now be delivered owing to occupation by the Poles.Maize is needed for sowing for fodder.
The number of pigs in all Germany has sunk from 25,000,000 before the war to 10,000,000 ; the number of cattle from 20,000,000 in 1916 to 17,000,000. These figures were given to us by Dr. H.The cattle we &quot;saw delivered at the Regensburg slaughter-house were in shocking * condition. They are fed, we were told, only on bay and straw largely the latter. Barley cannot be spared, and oil cake is not to be had. Fodder is in consequence greatly needed. As a consequence of the lack of fodder, the milk supply has been seriously affected. Baron Z. of Konigswiesen, near Regensburg, told us that, whereas before the wax he had supplied 750 litres daily, he could now only supply 150. We were naturally unable to check this statement, but we give the figures for what they may be worth.3. MILITARY.The Bavarian Army may be said to have ceased to exist as a serious fighting force. The best men have been demobilized and absorbed in industry or agriculture ; those who remain, with the exception of a rather numerous staff carrying out the work of demobilization, consist of Sicherheitstruppen and so called demobilization troops (Demobilmachungstruppen). The latter are demobilized men who, being without employment, are lodged and fed in barracks, are not armed (in theory at any rate), do not work and are subject to no discipline ; they draw 1 mk per day and are only retained in barracks until work has been found for them, the object being to prevent them swelling the ranks of the unemployed. Even so, they remain a constant source of danger, and the authorities (both civil and military) are anxious to get rid of them as early as possible.The Sicherheitstruppen are those who have volunteered to remain in the army as a force to maintain public order. They are armed and organized separately and have their own special barracks. They draw 4 mk a day with a premium of 2 mk daily for efficient service. Nominally subject to discipline, they have little or none. They have their.&quot;councils&quot; which work well so far as administration is concerned but have proved fatal to the maintenance of discipline. Most of the men are attracted only by the pay, they are largely infected with Bolshevism and they cannot be relied upon.Many incidents may be cited in support of this. When, on 13th April, the village of Kallmunz was raided by Spartacists from, the neighbouring county town of Burglengenfeld, the village telephoned to the garrison of Amberg for. assistance. The garrison refused, though the Sicherheitstruppen of Regensburg, to whom the village then appealed, responded to the call and sent a detachment who restored order. On 15th April, infantry, cavalry and artillery passed through Regensburg on the way to Munich. At Landshut, however, the garrison demanded that they should be disarmed and in consequence, without any fighting, they returned to Regensburg.On the 16th April, other troops came into contact with the Munich Soviet troops (including artillery) near Munich. The latter attempted to fraternize and succeeded in inducing the Government troops to retire on the understanding that neither side should fire. On the Government troops retiring, however, the Munich artillery fired on them, inflicting serious casualties.Our authority for the latter statement is the Lieut.-Colonel, commanding the troops at Regensburg. He believes that the Sicherheits troops of Regensburg can be trusted to defend Regensburg against a Bolshevist raid (during the night of 17th-18th April, they turned out well on an alarm that Red Guards on an armoured train were on their way from Munich to raid the petrol tanks at Regensburg), but he does not believe that they or any Bavarian troops, with the exception of the Epp Brigade, can be trusted in an attack on Munich, and thinks that the Bolshevist regime there can only be overcome with the help of Noske&apos;s Prussians.In addition to the normal troops of the II and III Bavarian Army Corps Districts, the only Bavarian force at the outbreak of the Bolshevist movement at Munich was the Epp Brigade (some 2,000 men, mostly Bavarians), which had been recruited by Colonel von Epp, late Commander of the Leibregiment, for service on the Eastern frontier. Recruiting for or enlisting in this force had been prohibited bv the Hoffmann Govern-ment a few weeks ago ; at the outbreak of the Munich revolution it was the only force on which it could rely.The Hoffmann Government has thus been driven to form a new force, and by appeals and proclamations to attempt to induce the people to join the new Militia (Volkswehr) and volunteer formations [Friewilligenkorps- or Freikorps). These two formations seem to be much the same, except that the latter are local bodies, bearing
the name of the town where they are recruited, and appear to resemble our &quot; Pals Battalions,&quot; appealing rather to the better classes. They receive 6 mk a day with allowances for dependants, and are to be subject to strict discipline.The Red Guards of Munich are supposed to number 30,000, and the rumour is current that they are being organized by an ex-Colonel of the German General Staff; according to a local paper, four well-known Bavarian officers (one Colonel and junior officers) are said to hold commands. Included among the Red Guards, are 2,000 Russian prisoners, while arms are said to have been distributed among numbers of workmen. They are said to have 60 guns, though short pf ammunition, and to be busy building emplacements and digging trenches for the defence of Munich.The capture of Munich is regarded by all with whom we have spoken as a serious affair, and the Hoffmann Government, having already had slight reverses in outpost skirmishes, appears to be determined not to act precipitately. The operations, in which Wiirttemberg troops are joining, are being directed by Dr. Ewinger, lately commanding the III Army Corps, from Ulm. The Hoffmann Government does not appear as yet to have accepted the Prussian help offered to it, but to be relying on the Wiirttemberg troops, who have sent to. its assistance, and its own newly-formed forces. With these it occupied Augsburg after some fighting on 20th April, and appears to be making it into a base for a further advance on Munich. These troops, we were told by Captain Christ of the American Army, who was in Augsburg on 20th April, appeared to him to be of good quality and well officered.4.-POLITICAL. A.-Narrative.We had scarcely set foot in. Germany when we were warned of the critical state of affairs in Bavaria. Munich, we were told in the course of a conversation in the train between Hagen and Frankfurt (30th March), was in a state of ferment and the stability of the Hoffmann Government, very doubtful.At Wurzburg (31st March 3rd April), we found the authorities, both civil and military, very anxious about the situation. There were no -strikes in the town and everything was quiet; but things were too quiet, we were told &quot; suspiciously quiet,&quot; and the subsequent outbreak, which occurred after we had left, proved the suspicion to be well founded. Bolshevist propaganda, we heard on every side, was very active in the district. The Bolshevist agitators had ample means at their disposal and used them freely, paying fixed premiums for converts and so forth. The funds appeared to come from Berlin through banks in touch with Russia; but we were unable to ascertain any details. Russians spoke at some of the meetings, but nothing was known of them, their nationality being only ascertained from their defective German. The people, the Oberhiirgermeister told us and he appeared to us to be sincere in all he said were in a state of moral collapse. They had broken down under the privations of the last four years. They had lost all sense of perspective. At the same meeting they would give equal applause to speakers who had been engaged in mutual attacks on one another. You could not rely on them from one hour to another. It was an eternal contest between the man who promised most and the man who spoke last. The semi-demobilized troops were the worst element of all. &quot; The army, which was once our pride, has now become a plague over the land.&quot; The best elements in the army had been absorbed in industry. The worst remained in so called Demobilization Companies ; did no work and were subject to no discipline, but were fed and lodged in barracks. They were thus kept off the streets but remained a continual element of danger. The police (130 strong) could be relied on; but apart from them both the Oberbiirgermeister and Major C. of the General Kommando told us they did not think in the case of an outbreak they could depend on more than l/3rd of the Sicherheitskompagnie some 200 men and three batteries of artillery quartered there. Theft, especially of goods in transit, was rampant, but no actual looting had taken place. Military magazines had been robbed and, so little were the troops to be depended on, that they now had civilians to a large extent to guard them.We have little doubt that the opinion shared by everyone we met at Wurzburg  from the Oberbiirgermeistcr down to a committee of workmen whom we saw at Kohig and Bauer&apos;s Printing Press Factory-that the general lack of food and the insufficiency of the rations is the root of all the political unrest, is sincere, and we believe that the Oberbiirgermeister is right in his opinion that the arrival of supplies especially fats-would considerably mitigate the danger of the political situation.
At nurnberg (3rd-14th April) the first words of the Oberburgermeister, when we had explained our mission, were -&quot; Gentlemen, I am afraid you have come too late.&quot; Everything was quiet, bat it was regarded as the calm before the storm. On Sunday (the 6th) the storm broke at Munich, where the Soviet Republic was proclaimed. The.following morning (the 7th) we saw the Oberburgermeister&apos;. He told us of the events at Munich, So far everything was quiet at Nurnberg, but he regarded the position as critical. Of the population of Nurnberg (370,000) some 85 per cent. 90 per cent, belonged to the working classes. To speak generally, they were steady, sensible, hard-headed ; well organized in their trades&apos; unions. But the people were thoroughly demoralized and could not be relied on. After years of strain and privation the reaction had come. In their despair they grasped at any new hope. Hundreds of Bolshevist agents Russian, as well as German -were at work. They promised them food from Russia, Roumania, Hungary. They dangled the promise of plenty before them. They suggested that the Entente were deliberately starving them, deliberately ruining them. They held up the example of Hungary before them. Let them trust their friends in the East rather than their enemies in the West. The Bourgeois classes were almost equally demoralized. They had become fatalistic. They were attaining the indifference of those who live on the slopes of a volcano. Their proverbial economy had given way to wastful extravagance. &quot;Eat, drink and be merry; for to-morrow we die.&quot;The position seemed so critical that we arranged that Lieutenant Beyfus should go to Berlin the following morning to report to Lieutenant Harding, who had already telephoned that he wished to have the latest information as to events in Bavaria, and also to endeavour to arrange that Major Sherman, of the American Mission at Nurnberg, looking after the interests of the Russian and Roumanian prisoners of war, should be given discretionary power to sell some of the spare supplies of bacon and ham in his hands to the local authorities. The supply of the ration of fat (62 grs. weekly) was problematic each week. At such a moment, it seemed to us that the failure to supply it or, on the other hand, an increased ration might conceivably turn the wavering scale. And Nurnberg appeared to us to be the key to the situation in Bavaria. If Nurnberg declared in the favour of the Munich Soviet Republic there seemed little hope of damming the tide before it swept over all Bavaria and threatened to flood the rest of Germany.During the day, the position improved, the Nurnberg Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council rejecting a motion in favour of the Soviet Republic by a majority of 138 to 70. Martial law, however, had been proclaimed; the Rathaus was closed except for one small side door strongly guarded; the ordinary patrols (consisting of one policeman and one soldier belonging to the &quot; Sicherheits&quot; company) had been increased and cavalry patrolled the town.The following morning (8th April), before Lieutenant Beyfus left for Berlin, we saw the Oberburgermeister again. The situation had changed for the worse. Some of the troops (Sicherheitstruppen) had refused service and a big Bolshevist demonstration was planned for the morning in favour of the Soviet Republic. The Oberburgermeister, who was obviously in a state of great excitement, told us that things were critical and he might have to resign within the next few hours. The Bolshevist demonstration in favour of the Soviet Republic fizzled out (partly, perhaps, owing to the pouring rain, which may have damped the enthusiasm of some of its supporters) and by the next day (9th April) the position could be regarded again as more or less normal. That evening the Oberburgermeister informed Captain Broad that he thought he had the situation in hand.Lieutenant Beyfus saw General Ewart at the British Embassy at Berlin on 9th April, and General Ewart agreed to give the suggested discretionary powers to Major Sherman. Lieutenant Beyfus further reported orally to Lieutenant Harding on the situation and made an Interim Report, which he handed to Lieutenant Harding for transmission to Spa. The following day (10th April) he returned to Nurnberg. The same day (10th April) Major Sherman sold to the Nurnberg authorities 50,000 lbs. of bacon and ham at the price of 10 mk. per lb., subject, however, to an understanding that he should refund the excess, if any, over the proper price.The position during the remainder of our stay at Nurnberg remained the same.Meanwhile at Wiirzburg the Communists, under the leadership of the Russian Bolshevist Wessow, had declared for the Soviet Republic on Monday, 7th April, and had seized the station, banks and Palace, where they had set up their Headquarters. On 9th April, however, they were overthrown by a combination of troops, citizens, students and workme*n.   The barracks of the 9th Infantry Regiment were taken without fighting,
the Palace and station captured with the assistance of machine guns and artillery. Sauber, a leading spirit of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of Munich, who had come to endeavour to bring the artillery over to the side of the Communists, was arrested in their barracks. Thus, the confidence expressed to us by the Oberburger-meister in the artillery appears to have been justified. On 7th April, the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of Regensburg also declared itself in favour of the Soviet Republic, but, on the 11th, it rescinded the resolution by a majority of 15-5 and returned to its allegiance to the Hoffmann Government at Bamberg.At Furth, adjoining Nurnberg, the collapse was even quicker. On 8th April, the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council declared in favour of the Soviet Republic and seized the Government of the town ; on the 10th, they resigned it again into the hands of the Burgermeister.This summary of the events at Wurzburg, Regensburg and Furth, which will illustrate the uncertain temper of the people, is made up from information. contained in the local Press.On our arrival at Regensburg (14th April) we found everything outwardly quiet. The previous night, however, the Sicherheitsbataillion had been called on at 10 p.m. to send a detachment to a village called Kalhnunz. which had been raided by an armed band of Spartacists from the neighbouring country town of Burglengenfeld, which is wholly in the hands of a Spartacist Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council. A previous appeal to the garrison of Amberg had failed. In the course of the fighting, a veterinary surgeon of Kallmunz was killed,- while the Spartacists were eventually driven off with a loss of one killed and several wounded. As the result of such incidents and the general feeling of insecurity prevailing, the peasants are beginning to call for the formation of village defence forces and a supply of arms. The history of Bolshevism in Russia  where the villagers receive the Red Guards with machine guns is thus repeating itself at an early stage in the development of Bolshevism in Bavaria.At the time of our leaving Regensburg (20th April), everything was quiet but the feeling was distinctly uneasy.We were unable to get into touch with Munich. Since 14th April there has been a general strike there and the city has been entirely cut off from outside except for an occasional outward train. The Soviet Government there, according to information we have received from several independent sources, have armed some 2,000 Russian prisoners with rifles and machine guns. In order to avoid the danger of a similar attempt at Regensburg, the Lieut.-Colonel commanding the troops there is endeavouring to have the Russian prisoners there confined to their camp instead of being left at liberty as at present, and he is anxious that the reason for his action should be known at Spa. The military situation is considered serious by all the Bavarian officers with whom we have spoken.&apos; They believe that no reliance can be put on Bavarian troops, with the exception of the Epp Brigade (some 2,000 men), and that Munich can only be reduced to order with the help of the Prussians.On Monday (21st April) we saw Major L. of the German Army, and Captain Christ of the American Army, who had just arrived (5 p.m.) from Augsburg. From them we learnt that disorder has reigned at Augsburg since Saturday afternoon (12th April) when the Stadtkommandant Edelmann armed the workmen. The following day (Sunday, 20th April) Government troops Wiirttemberger and troops of the New Bavarian Volkswehr-took the town, with the exception of Pfersee, the working-men&apos;s quarter, which still remains in their hands. The Government troops, we are told, are of good quality and well officered. The general conduct of the Governments operations against Munich is being directed from Ulm by Dr. Ewinger, lately commanding the III Army Corps at Nurnberg. According to Major L., the Hoffmann Government is determined, at whatever cost, to crush the Munich revolutionaries, and to put an end, once for all, to the growth of Bolshevism in Bavaria.B. Observations.For the sake of clarity we have discussed the economic and political questions under separate headings. But, in our opinion, the economic and political conditions at present existing form a single problem, which must be viewed as a whole.. To separate them, to leave the questions of the supply of food and raw materials to experts, and to view the political problem by itself, is, in our opinion, fraught with serious danger. The political problem at the moment is, we believe, to a large extent psychological.   To
understand it, it is necessary to realize the state of mind of the masses of the German people. The accounts given to us of the state of the masses by the Oberbiirgermeister of Wurzburg and Nurnberg, which we have endeavoured to summarize above, accord with all we have ourselves observed since we have been in Bavaria. Not only the undernourishment of the masses over a period of years must be considered, the poor quality of the food, the monotony of it, the almost complete lack of stimulants (tea, coffee, &amp;c- &quot; War beer &quot; can scarcely be considered a stimulant), must be taken into account. Add the apparently hopeless outlook, and it is easy to understand the state of nervous depression and moral collapse, which we believe to be at the root of all the industrial and political unrest at present prevailing.A people of no political aptitude, unaccustomed to liberty and suddenly freed from an iron discipline, still suffering from serious privations and despairing of the future, they are exposed to a propaganda brillantly organized, amply supplied with funds and wholly unscrupulous in its methods; a propaganda that harps on the present lack of food and promises ample supplies from the rich corn lands of the East (in the Milnchner Rote Fahne of 3rd April, for example, an. article on the food question ends &quot; Our food situation is absolutely catastrophic. And yet Ebert and Scheidemann have dared to reject the Eussian food supplies &quot;), a propaganda that offers them an alliance with the &quot; free peoples &quot; of Eussia and Hungary against the &quot;Imperialists and Capitalists&quot; of the West, that promises them food, freedom and prosperity, and backs its promises with gold, or, at any rate, paper.We have seen it alleged in the Entente Press that the Bolshevist movement in Germany is inspired from high quarters. As to this, we do not feel that we are in a position to express any opinion. But we are - convinced that the Bolshevist movement in Bavaria is a genuine one and no stage play designed to terrorize the Peace Conference into granting easier terms. It is, however, we think, undoubtedly encouraged by some of the IntelUgenzia, who see in it the one hope of escaping the Peace Terms. Their ideas were sketched to us by Dr. H., of the Oberbayerische Christliche Bauernverein. They say, &quot; We are going to be ruined anyhow under the Peace Terms. Our only method of escaping lasting economic slavery is to form a Bolshevik block with Hungary and Eussia. GermanTAustria, Poland and Bohemia are already permeated with Bolshevism and they will join us. If once such a combination is formed, Italy and France will never withstand the contagion. The whole European Continent will become Bolshevist. The old Europe will disappear; the old civilization will be destroyed. But Germany will escape the conditions of Peace; she will repudiate her - debts (in common with the other countries); she will start level in the task of building up the New Europe. And if she starts level she will start ahead. The richest districts of France have been destroyed, Belgium has been ruined, Germany is far ahead of Russia, Hungary, Poland and Italy in education, science, organization in all that will make for leadership in the new civilization.&quot; In a word, they are willing to welcome chaos rather than pay the penalty of defeat. We are informed, though we have not ourselves seen the article, that Professor Elsbacher (ex-pan-German) has written an article on these lines in Der Tag (also ex-pan-German). Thus Bolshevism and Nationalism form an unnatural alliance, as they appear already to have done in Hungary. The Hungarian example, indeed, seems to have had a great influence. To the German masses, Hungary appears to have shaken off the yoke of the Entente by the simple expedient of embracing Bolshevism. It appears to us that, in considering the measures to be adopted with regard to Hungary, this factor should not be left out of account.How far this movement has gone among the Intelligenzia, we are unable to estimate, but it appeals to be on the increase. To give two slight examples, a Rechtsanwalt, attached to the Nurnberg Food Control Office, told us, in the course of a general conversation, how he had been expressing to a friend, a doctor of philosophy, and his wife, who were at his house on a visit, his satisfaction that Nurnberg had held out against the Munich Soviet Republic, whereupon the doctor of philosophy stood up, drew himself up stiffly and, pointing to his wife, said, &quot; We are for the Soviet Republic ! &quot; while among those arrested at Wurzburg, after the collapse of the movement, there was a personal friend of the Rechtsanwalt, a son of a former Oberburgermeister of the town. It is, we think, almost certain that there are many who are awaiting the peace terms before they take the plunge, but who, if once convinced that the terms of peace mean the ruin of Germany, will endeavour to plunge the whole world into a common ruin, from which Germany will then have, at least, an equal chance of emerging into a new, if different, era of prosperity. It is noteworthy that the rumour is current in Munich that the Red Guards of the Soviet Republic are&apos;&quot;&apos; &apos; ...... .......   ............. 1 &apos; &apos;
being organized by ani ex-colonel of the German General Staff. Whether true or not, it may, perhaps, be regarded as indicative of the feeling that there is a common interest between the new leaders of world revolution and the old leaders of German domination. So far, however, as our personal experience is concerned, all the officers we have met appear to be genuinely aghast at the progress made by Bolshevism. Lieut.-Colonel G. sighed for the help of a trusty British regiment, while another longed for occupation by the troops of the Entente.So far as we can judge, neither the reasons which appeal to the masses nor those which appeal to the Intelligenzia appear to have shaken the rooted objections of the bourgeois to Bolshevism, but. they certainly share the idea that, if once Germany becomes Bolshevist, nothing can save France and Italy. This is practically an idee fixe. They are confirmed in this idea by their astonishment that Bolshevism should have made such progress in Bavaria. &quot; A year ago,&quot; they say, &quot; we thought it impossible, and now it is like the grippe.&quot; To the question, why in Bavaria of all countries a land of peasant farmers, devotedly Catholic, better off as regards food supplies probably than many other districts Bolshevism should be getting its first serious foothold in Germany, we have usually received a shrug of the shoulders as our only answer. The Oberbiirgermeister of Regensburg thought it might be due to the fact that the Bavarians are a simple folk, &quot; childlike souls,&quot; less wide awake, less able to realize the emptiness of the promises made to them, more emotional and impression-able than the colder blooded German of the north. It is in any case chiefly due to the influence of Munich, which is endeavouring to play in Bavaria the r61e which Paris has so often played in the history of France. Three factors seem to have contributed to the growth of Bolshevism in Munich. At the first outbreak of the revolution in November, 1918, the powerful personality of Kurt Eisner carried the movement far to the left in Munich ; his murder gave a further impetus in that direction. In the second place, the dislike and jealously of Prussia intensified by the complete failure of Prussian policy lend powerful support to any movement which is opposed to the centralizing policy of the Weimar Government. Lastly, Munich naturally the home of a cosmopolitan Intelligenzia has become the gathering place of the advanced Intellectuals and new-fangled theorists from Russia and the East, as well as from all parts of Germany ; there has grown up a new war-industry Proletariat Krupps Works are the typical example and the combination of these two forces has easily overwhelmed the faint-hearted opposition of a majority lacking alike cohesion and vigour.While, the bourgeois in Bavaria are thoroughly opposed to Bolshevism, they-appear to have little power of resistance. They seem almost unwittingly to have been swept so far by the tide of revolution that now, when they see their country drifting towards the stormy waters of Bolshevism, they have not the moral energy to struggle against the current. The Bavarian bourgeois want peace and quiet above all things, but they are too easy-going to set up a stout fight for them. With little or no cohesion, they have resigned practically all power to the Social-Democrats, to whom they give their moral support; and, if the Bolshevist movement in Bavaria is overthrown, it will be the work of the Social-Democratic party.To sum up. we believe that Bolshevism in Bavaria is a serious movement, brought into being, indeed, and organized by non-Bavarian leaders, both Russian and Prussian, fanned possibly by some of the irreconcilables of the Pan-German party, but dangerous, above all, by reason of the fact that the Bavarian troops are so infected by it that little or no reliance can be placed on them. That the Hoffmann Government in its endeavours to cope with the situation has been obliged to form a new militia (Volkswehr) and volunteer formations (Freikorps) is eloquent evidence of this fact. We do not think that the check which the Bolshevist movement received at Nurnberg or its failure at Wurzburg, Fiirth and Regensburg, after momentary, successes, can be considered as final. From all we have heard, we believe that the triumph of Bolshevism in Bavaria would be the signal for similar, and probably successful, outbreaks in the industrial districts of Saxony and Prussia. The only method by which, in our opinion, the danger can be met, is to send to those parts of Germany where constitutional government exists, and to those only, ample supplies of food as soon as possible, and at such prices that they will be available for the masses, and to stimulate German industry by sending the raw materials most needed and by removing, wherever possible, the restrictions on foreign trade and on trade between the two banks of the Rhine. Of foods, fats are by far the most important; then milk, meat, potatoes and some stimu-lants such as tea or coffee. Of raw materials (apart from coal, which we have discussed under the heading &quot; Raw Materials &quot;), cotton is the most vital; the lack of under
clothing of all sorts is a source of almost as much dissatisfaction as that of food; then wool, leather, flax, copper, iron ore, lubricating oil and rubber. The arrival and distribution of food from the West will lift from the German masses that weight of despair of which we have already spoken and which we believe to be the mainspring of the Bolshevist movement. It will turn their eyes back to the West, from which help will have come. It will justify, in their eyes, those leaders who have promised the arrival of supplies from the Entente. The arrival of raw materials will not only enable the most pressing wants of the population to be met, but above all will help to solve the vital problem of unemployment. The .semi-demobilized soldiers, who are still lodged and fed in barracks owing to lack of employment, are a constant source of danger ; those who are supported by the municipalities no less so. If the factories can be set to work, this element of danger will, at least, be minimized.We have met both optimists and pessimists in almost equal numbers, and we feel that we are scarcely in a position to judge whether the Bolshevist movement can yet be checked : on the whole, however, we incline to the side of the optimists. But we are convinced that the promptest action on the part of the Entente Governments is indispensable. The food conditions in the Bavarian cities, while bad, are undoubtedly better than those of the Ruhr district and the industrial districts of Saxony: but we believe that the political situation in Bavaria is even more dangerous than in those districts and that, from the political point of view, the arrival of food is just as urgent.In view of the straits to which the Bourgeois in Munich are likely to be reduced , before the city can be retaken, it has been suggested to us. on behalf of the Hoffmann Government that it would be desirable to have supplies (milk and fats especially) at some convenient place such as Mannheim or Nurnberg, in readiness to provision the city on its capture.From a political point of view, it seems to us that it might be of distinct advantage that the arrival of Entente food supplies should be the immediate result of the overthrow of the Bolshevist regime.JAS. E. BROAD,Captain.G. H. BEYFUS,. Lieutenant.26th April, 1919
IIIa-REPORT BY LIEUTENANT WAREING ON A VISIT TO MUNICH.   (lst-19th APRIL, 1919.)NARRATIVE.I travelled as far as Wtirzhurg with Captain Broad and Lieutenant Beyfus, whom I left on 1st April. I arrived in Munich the same evening in an extremely crowded train the only fast train in the day and reported the next morning to the Minister for Military Affairs (contrary to Prussia, Bavaria has abolished the word &quot;war&quot;). In Munich, as in the rest of Bavaria, officers no longer wear their badges of rank, and few even wear uniform. They are all subject to election by the Soldiers&apos; Councils, but most of those employed on special duties (press bureau, passport offices, &amp;c.) appear to have been retained, except in a few cases where they have made themselves particularly unpopular.The Minister for Military Affairs, Herr Schneppenhorst, received me personally, and in the course of conversation said : &quot;If no food arrives in Munich within a fortnight, Munich will become a Soviet Republic,&quot; a statement which I at once transmitted to Berlin, together with some suggestions made later by the Director of the Food Office. (This letter appears to have been delayed until too late to be of use at the British Mission, Berlin.) As the food situation in Munich had been made the subject of a detailed enquiry about six weeks before, I restricted my enquiries to such changes in the situation as&apos; had since arisen, and the Director of the Food Office, whom I knew well before the war, promised to prepare a report. Subsequent s events, however, made further enquiries impossible.I was then introduced to Major A., late Consul in Manchester, who was most affable and ingratiating, chiefly, I think, in the hope of favours to come. He lost no opportunity in setting forth the cause of Germany in general and himself in particular. He attempted to keep me to a programme which he evidently regarded as &quot; safe,&quot; and, had it not been for my previous knowledge of Munich and my fairly numerous acquaintances there, I do not think that I should have heard views from both sides. In the case of such people as I. had not met before, his services as an intermediary and his official position were extremely useful and, once convinced that I should not leave the track he had laid down for me, he was untiring in his efforts to make the running smooth.On 3rd April&apos;, I met the Director of the Press Bureau, Lieutenant-Colonel E., an elderly officer who has travelled all over the world, and had made in China and Japan many English friends in the military and diplomatic world. He has held his present position for about four years, and is a bluff, jovial and far-seeing man; a sort of Bavarian John Bull, who, having weighed his opinion, speaks it in no measured terms. On hearing that I had lived in Bavaria, he spoke chiefly in dialect. Expurgated and summarised, his views were as follows : &quot; You are too late. Nobody believes in you any longer. Ludendorff made a fool of himself with his Brest-Litowsk peace. Do you think that you will undo his folly by making still greater fools of yourselves at Paris ? You have let the Bolshevists have their own way by deliberately encouraging disorderly conditions and hunger in Germany, the two factors which most of all make for its spread. Germany is a dying man ; if you now ask me what sort of soup the dying man likes best I will tell you, but I fear you are too late to save him.&quot;   He continued more calmly.&quot; 1 do not wish to exaggerate, but 1 am really afraid you are too late. However, in what you do now, try at least to show understanding. Dont pay too much attention to mere calories; you have to heal the mind as well as the body. Send tea for the women, tobacco for the men, strengthening food for the children, comforts for the invalids. Bring it yourselves, don&apos;t trade in the food you send ; England is too great to need to profit from our sufferings. Let it be distributed here by the English at cost price or a little above. Publish (or we will do it for you) what you are doing, and you may even now change the heart of the suffering masses. But, above all, deeds not words,,and a.straight deal.&quot; I found the same scepticism in others, but not always coupled with the Colonels practical advice.   .        ... ....\.
It is quite impossible to separate the economic from the political situation, and I was obliged to spend a good deal of time in trying to elucidate the political position, which was extremely complicated. There was at that time (3rd April) a double control, firstly a parliamentary cabinet containing both majority and minority socialists but no particularly outstanding figure, and, secondly, the workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Councils who countersigned all ministerial documents. Thus the Soldiers&apos; Council checked the work of the Minister for Military Affairs, and the Workmen&apos;s Council that of&apos;the Home Secretary.From the 4th to the 6th, I was in Salzburg-(Austria) and I arrived back in Munich on the evening of the 6th to find that a Soviet or Council Republic had been proclaimed. This was a last concession made by the less extreme leaders to save the situation and retain what power they could rather than let the extreme Left overthrow them and imitate Russian methods. The latter, however, at once expressed their distrust and claimed control of the councils for themselves. .The first intention was that the councils should be representative and not dictatorial, the basis of representation being economic and not political. The efforts of the leaders who first set up the Council Republic may well be compared with those of such people as Orage, G. D. Cole and Hilaire Belloc in England to establish a system of National Guilds. The comparison is not quite exact but points in common are numerous. The chief are: the movement is national, riot international; it relies on the economic rather than the political weapon because it does not trust parliamentary Government, which, it says, is controlled by a few groups of interests behind the scenes; it is anti-Bolshevist in so far as it refuses to shed blood or to attack the Church. (Compare The New Age, weekly, or BehWs book The Servile State.) In Bavaria, however, the stability of such a system must be consistently imperilled by the presence of mild extremist elements, of Russian or Jewish origin almost without exception, who are anxious to imitate Bolshevist tactics, who call in the aid of the criminal and lawless elements always to be found in a great town, and are, moreover, well supplied with money. With such people the movement would become inter-national, in so far as the large towns would be linked up, but could never become stable, owing to the opposition of the peasants and of the Church. . A necessary factor of its maintenance would be some form of terrorization.Munich had to choose between these two systems, for it had become obvious that mistrust of the Hoffmann Government&apos; was so great that an explosion could only be avoided by a radical and far-reaching concession. The Diet was to meet on the 8th, and already threats had been made and bloodshed, seemed inevitable. On the 6th, the Council Republic was declared and, by means of feverish work and appeals for union, it maintained itself for three days, always, however, with a tendency to fall to the Left. Measures for expropriating capital, for restricting the withdrawal of money from the banks, and for socialising industry, were proclaimed in rapid succession, and an attempt to improve the housing problem, a compulsory billeting scheme, was introduced. On the whole these created little public opposition, and the billeting scheme allowed a fortnights grace, during which the owners of spare rooms might allot them to relatives and friends.The 7th was proclaimed a National Holiday on which no work might be performed, exCept such as was &quot;necessary in the interests of the working people,&quot; e.g., food distribution, water, light, &amp;c.On the 8th, I was ordered to Berlin to report on the political situation, and, before leaving, I tried to see as many people as possible. The late Minister of Finance, whom I have known for some years, came to see me. He regarded the present change as premature. &quot;They have forced a situation,&quot; he said, &quot;which would have come of itself in a few weeks.&quot; He had been invited to take a ministerial post but had refused, preferring to wait and see how the situation developed. Lack of coal was the . chief difficulty. If food trains came in now, the effect of their arrival would be politically far greater than if one waited until the town was near famine, and as in Vienna the amount received per individual so small as to be almost useless. Their arrival at once would fill up the gaps and people would be more grateful.I also went to see the Central Council, and Herr B., then replacing the Minister for Military Affairs, told me he was very anxious that the Entente should recognise the present government [i.e., the Central Council), and thus strengthen them against the Bolshevist tendencies of the extreme left. Bavaria would always resist Prussian or other foreign intervention which professed to restore &quot; law and order&quot; by the use of force. There had been no disorder or plundering whatever, and he hoped that none would arise. Bavaria would not tolerate the raising of any kind of armed force, or anything approaching civil war.    Herr C, expressed the fear that Prussia would
try to isolate Bavaria. If food supplies were to be sent, they should be sent along the left bank of the Rhine to Mannheim, whence the Government would arrange for their transport. On no account should they go to Hamburg or Baltic ports, otherwise Prussia would seize them. Herr D. spoke to the same effect. &apos; I told them that I could not make any statement regarding the attitude or policy of the Entente, but would report their views.It will be noticed that the attitude of these people was Bavarian and national; they were, however, continually in fear of being overthrown by the Bolshevist element, which would try to join up with Hungary and the Spartacists in Prussia.During this time, the attitude of the Munich garrison was theoretically neutral. These troops are chiefly men from dep6t units who were not regarded as sufficiently trained or reliable to be sent to the front. They number &quot;about 15,000, and are thoroughly bad soldiers, unreliable and willing to change to any point of view if they are paid to do so. Some fairly good elements exist in the Bodyguard Regiment (about 600 men), but they are in the minority. On my return from Berlin on the 8th, I found that there had been no disturbance, but opposition was steadily growing. The Bolshevists regarded the attempt as too moderate in tendency, while the man in the street was incensed at being ordered about by six Jews, most of whom were strangers to Munich. The news of strong action by the Hoffmann Government and Colonel Epp (in command of the Bavarian Volunteer Corps raised outside Bavaria by the late commander of the Bodyguard Regiment) strengthened middle-class opinion, the more so as it had become clear that the extremists would shortly seize the power and carry out a purely Russian programme. In consequence, the Munich garrison took matters into its own hands and proclaimed its- allegiance to the Hoffmann Government, whose emissaries had been speaking night and day in the various barracks. The Central Council fell, and the garrison published on Sunday morning (13th) a proclama-tion appealing to the people to support the Hoffmann Government.Meanwhile, yielding to pressure from the Left, the Central Council had deserted its original principles and had armed the working class on Thursday and Friday, for the ostensible purpose of resisting outside intervention On Saturday night, the garrison troops found that opposition by the workers was being organized. They * occupied the newspaper offices and arrested various members of the Central Council, including Toller, its leading spirit, a young student of idealist and fairly moderate views. Levien, a more radical leader, also disappeared temporarily, taking with him, according to report, 17 million marks, a portion of the 56 million seized from the banks for socialisation purposes. On Sunday afternoon, the reaction began armed workmen seized lorries and put to flight garrison troops in various- parts of the town, although the latter far out-numbered them. Encouraged by their success, the workmen attacked the garrison troops at the station and occupied it. Heavy firing continued for many hours, but casualties were remarkably few (about five killed) and the troops surrendered. On Monday, the 14th, the garrison, inspired by a promised extra 5 marks per day, published a proclamation stating that their previous attitude was due to a mistake, and that they now unanimously supported the Council Republic.The Central Council was again formed, but this time of far more radical and Bolshevist elements. Recruiting began for a Red Army, and anti-bourgeois decrees were published. The town was very nervous, though externally calm, and all public services except light and water ceased to function.I went to see Colonel E. in the afternoon, and during my&apos; absence my room was searched and my papers &quot;borrowed &quot; for a few hours. On my return, I was arrested by a sailor and taken to the Central Council. Apparently the sailor had somewhat exceeded his orders; the charge was not quite clear, bu^ I understood I was charged with associating with officers and with having a! revolver. I claimed that I must be allowed to associate with anybody I liked, that I was honourably endeavouring to carry out a purely unpolitical mission, and that a revolver was part of my uniform. Without waiting for the Central Council to meet, my captors who now numbered about ten- held a council of their own. I overheard their debates. &quot; An English officer must have complete freedom,&quot; they said, &quot; and this one appears to be honest and good tempered. . Moreover, he is not a bourgeois and may be trusted with his revolver.&quot; In the end a vote was taken which was unanimously in my favour, and I was told that the sailor was an unreliable man who was a White Guard one day and a Red Guard the next. They, the Red Guards, wished to apologize ; they trusted that his hasty action would not prejudice my opinions, and I was completely free. My revolver was at the Town Commandants Office and would be handed back the next morning.   On my return to the hotel I found my papers had been returned
and none were missing. As, however, I heard that Munich was to be completely isolated by the Hoffmann Government, and as the last train left at 7.50 on Tuesday morning, I decided to take it, although it meant I should not be able to recover my revolver.As usual, I walked through the streets to Colonel E.&apos;s house (all the offices were closed) in uniform without any incident. One or two people raised their hats and the Reel Guards paid no attention to my presence. One or two to whom I spoke were polite, as the Muncbner usually is, and asked what I thought of things. The reply which always brought satisfaction was: &quot; Everything seems very quiet and orderly.&quot;Colonel E. talked for several hours and without the restraint which the 0 presence of Major A. had previously imposed. It is evidently an understood thing that the latter officer is responsible for the impressions which visitors take away with them, and, although he does appear to be popular, his hints as to the directions which conversation should follow were usually taken. At that time the Major was absent in Berlin and my movements were consequently uncontrolled.Colonel E. at once admitted the guilt of Germany, which he ascribed to the &quot;incurable Prussian belief that they are cleverer than other people and can always do them down.&quot; He described his conversations with Ludendorff and the refusal of the latter to take a wide view of the course of events. &quot;There is nothing to be done with the Prussians,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot; but to let them stew in their old juice ; they are quite incurable. You should make peace with each German State separately instead of consolidating Germany once more under Prussia and reviving the militarism which is foreign to the South German nature. We Bavarians will have no more of it; we are determined to resist the formation of any kind of armed force which is not purely for police duty.&quot; He pleaded that the least gesture by the Entente in the direction of Bavaria would have an immediate and widespread effect. The people were really honestly determined to begin anew ; they had actually done away with the army from beginning to end. Were they to be bound once again to a country (Prussia) in which even now Noske was rein trod ucing the old militarist methods ? Bavaria was looking for a sign, but none came, and in despair was turning to Bolshevist sources in the hope of beginning its.new lease of life. Hoffmann was doomed; Noske had spoken of &quot;my friend Hoffmann,&quot; and the Bavarian people were absolutely determined to have nothing to do with Noske or his methods. The one person who could save parliamentary government in Bavaria was Muhlon. Again, let the Entente give a sign; they knew how best to do it, and the country might be saved from Bolshevism. Relations of some kind&apos; should be established with Bavaria, food should be sent. What the Entente should, not do was to support Prussian intervention by Epp (whose troops are nine-tenths Prussian) or by any other non-Bavarians. The people are determined to avoid civil war at all costs, but the whole country would rise to oppose Prussian troops.The views expressed above are supported to a great extent by what I have heard in other quarters. Even the old aristocracy is quite convinced of the hopelessness of the monarchist cause. It is felt that Bavaria must begin anew, and I was astounded, after five years absence, at the reality of the particularist feeling which before the war had been little more than a dying tradition. To-day, some of the most sober elements in the country are disposed to accord a trial to some form of moderate communism rather than have a government which submits to Prussian control and Prussian military and diplomatic methods. The religious idealism which stood out in the appeals for fraternity touched a responsive chord hi the Bavarian nature, and certain of the clergy are already prepared to turn to what good they can, should the contingency arise, a movement which has so far restrained from attacking, or even from insulting, the Church. Fear of Russianism is perhaps greater than lear of Prussianism, but the Bavarian character is regarded as a healthy organism, which, when its growing pains have ended, may throw off the disease. National Bavarian feeling is very strong, and there is little feeling of solidarity with the Russian territorists or the Prussian Spartacists, even, amongst the most radical of the armed workmen who, when I left, controlled the situation.I left Munich, by the last train which ran towards the north, at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the 18th. So far as one could see from the train, the dividing line between &quot;the Red and the White Guards ran somewhere between Dachau and Ingolstadt, but one could not be sure of its exact position. We saw no movement of troops during the whole journey, ^ and Munich Station was very lightly guarded when we left. My Bavarian servant, who belongs to the Bodyguard Regiment, and is very anti-revolutionary, told me that about half bis regiment (some 300-400 men) had been sent in lorries that morning to Rosenheim to quell a pro-Government outbreak.   He expressed his disgust that his
regiment should be used against the Government and his intention of joining Colonel Epp&apos;s or other Governmental troops as soon as he could.The train was carefully examined by Government troops at Erlangen, and a further examination took place at Bamberg, the headquarters of the Bavarian Government.Here I noticed a journalist, whose acquaintance I had made at Munich, of whose nationality I am not sure, walking, along the platform with one of the station police. I did not realize that he was under arrest and spoke to him in English. This led to the compartment, in which Mr. Charles Tower (Berlin correspondent of the Times) and I were sitting, being visited. I showed my papers, but the Station Commandant^ a Captain whose behaviour throughout was very arrogant and high-handed, ordered me to come to his office with, my luggage. He then signalled for the train to leave. I warned him that he had no right to interfere with a British officer in uniform accredited to his own Government, and he then ordered the train to be kept waiting. He telephoned to a Foreign Office official and related the circumstances. The latter told him to detain me, and the train was sent on. He wished to examine my packets but desisted in view of my emphatic protest. We were then driven .to the Foreign Office, where an official (presumably the one to whom the Captain had spoken) accused me of travelling to Munich in an aeroplane without a permit. I pointed out that it was a Bavarian military machine piloted by a Bavarian officer, and that, on the date on which I left Berlin (the 10th), there was no government to issue a permit, except at Munich. The manner of these two officials was discourteous and my impression was that, realizing their mistake, they were trying to trump up some kind of justification. The official from the Foreign Office told the Captain to submit me to a rigorous personal examination. Mr. Tower and I were then driven to the police headquarters, our luggage was taken away, and we were detained whilst telephonic enquiries were made. As a result of these, we were liberated and profuse apologies were made by a third Government official. The Captain became as ingratiating as he had previously been arrogant, and even wished to shake hands. I told the Government representative that I had no personal grievance against him, that I had from the beginning been only too ready to submit to any enquiries made in a reasonable spirit, but that I should be obliged to report the matter to my military superiors at Spa, who would certainly not tolerate the attitude taken up towards a British officer in uniform by the Station Commandant and the Foreign Office. Mr. Tower and I were given an imposing official passport, and left by the same train on the following day (Wednesday), for Lichtenfels and Berlin, where we arrived on Thursday midday.I began my report at Berlin and left there on Friday evening, reaching Cologne on Saturday the 19th at midday.Transport. Owing to the disturbed condition of Munich and the difficulty of knowing of whom the Government consisted at any particular moment, I was much handicapped in my enquiries. The following information, however, is derived from the permanent officials of the Ministry of Communications (Verhehrs-Ministerium).Reduction of train service. On all except the most important lines, fast trains have been entirely discontinued. There still remained on 13th April two per day to Berlin (by different routes), and one fast train thrice a week on theLandshut, Salzburg, and Lindau lines. The last three services were run by one engine only. The slow trains had been reduced to about one-sixth of their former number, whilst the number of goods trains had fallen by about 10 per cent. In the case of the latter, however, the average load has been reduced by some 30 per cent, owing to the fact that the heaviest locomotives were handed over to the Entente, and those which remain are not capable of doing the same work. ^The number of locomotives is as follows : August, 1914. April, 1919.Augsburg area...      ...      ...      ...    91 51Munich area   ......      ...      ...   209 147Batisbon area ...      ...      ......   148 92Wagons and trucks. During the week ending 29th March, 1919, 22,260 covered wagons and 36,59.1 open trucks were required for use. Of these, 2,200, or about 9 per cent., covered wagons, and 29,699, Or 81 per cent., open trucks could not be put into service, owing to shortage. Moreover, practically only wagons- capable of carrying 10 to 12^ ton loads could be used, owing to the 15 and 20-ton wagons having been handed to the Entente.Coal. For the present traffic requirements, the daily :consumption of coal is 2,900 tons. On 29th March, the stock of coal amounted to 21,100 tons, and, during the week ending 5th of April, the amount being received daily was 3,210 tons.
Permanent way and signals. These are in fairly good condition arid would be capable of standing a 50 per cent, increase of trains1 running at speeds up to 40 miles per hour (60 km.). . &apos; :Repair workshops:  At present about 40 per cent, of the &quot;locomotives are&apos; under repair; before the war the average was 18 per cent. An exceptional increase in the amount of repairs took place from December, 1918, to March, 1919, when the material was being put in order for the Entente. The amount of rolling stock leaving the workshops daily after repair has diminished by over 30 per cent., in spite of an increase in the number of employees from 8,000 to 13,000. This is due chiefly to the heavy strain imposed on rolling stock during the war, the difficulty of obtaining* material for repairs, and the reduction of the efficiency of the workmen owing to insufficient food..General.--The efficiency of the railways as a whole is about 40 per cent, less than before the-war, owing to the increased necessity for repairs, and the handing over of the best heavy locomotives. Over 10,000 goods wagons are now lying waiting for repairs, which1 can only be carried out extremely gradually owing to lack of tools arid material..n *b        i  . (Signed)   &apos; E.
