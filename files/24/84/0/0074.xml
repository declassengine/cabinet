The classification of disabilities &quot;Tor which oiTicers anTmen in the Array and Navy have been pensioned (a) during the month of June and (b) since the beginning of the war to June 30th, 1919, is given in Appendix V. Of the 984,157 pensioned disabilities from the beginning of the War to the end of June, 44.42 per cent, were due to v/ounds and injuries and 55.58 per cent, to disease.19. Treatment of the limbless.   Appendix VI shows how 35,121 limbless men have fceen&quot;*or are &quot;being dealt with.

Amongst the discharges were 33 double amputations -in 30 cases both legs, and in 3 cases an arm and a legj in one case the man had lost all his limbs and was fitted with four artificial limbs .20. Treatment of the Blind.   From the beginning of the war up to the end .of June, 1,46$ totally blinded men have been admitted to the Blinded Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Hostel, St.Dunstanfe. Regent^ Park, and its annexes, of whom 769 have passed through.   Of this number 724 have set up for themselves, whilst 45,31 chiefly ov;ing to mental or physical disability, have left without being; set up.   At the end of the month, 670 were in residence, and 30 in hospital were to follow when fit to be discharged.With regard to blinded officers, 31 are at present under instruction at St.Dunstan&apos;s, 53 have left, and 5 are waiting in hospital till they are fit for discharge-^1* Surgical Appliances (other than artificial limbs).     The number of cases brought on the record during&apos; &quot;June was 4,67lT&quot;as against 6,470 in May.22. Special Medical Board.    (For functional nervous diseases)(l)   Numbers dealt with.   During June, this Board summoned 3,595 officers and men of whom 2,901 attended and were examined. Of this number 81 were recommended for institutional treatment, 7 were borderline cases, 3 were recommended for an Epiloptic Colony and 113 were assisted to find employment.(2)x In last month1s Report the number was 53, but some of the 53 have returned and have, with further teaching, been able to set up for themselves.
(2)   Lancaster Gate Clinic.   During   June, 275 cases were treated and 69 discharged as follows:-	Clinic for Psycho-therapy.

To judge of the work of this Clinic the Article at paragraph 335 of the War Pensions Gazette (Appendix XIII) should be read.23.   Treatment of discharged soldiers in Military Hospitals.   An Army Council Instruction paying down &apos;the procedure to be observed Tilth regard to the admission of discharged soldiers to a military hospital is attached as Appendix VII. - &apos; -24.   Convalescent and Training Centres.(1) For Disabled Men. Efforts are being made to secure suitable centres ?/here convalescent men can undergo training; the Treasury have authorised the expenditure of a sum for initial capital outlay not exceeding  80 per head of the men to be accommodated up to a number of 2,500 places; and a conference has been held with representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Wori:s with regard to the steps to be taken for expediting the arrangements for the establishment of such centres(2)&apos;  For Disabled Officers.   The enquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the needs of officers for whom concurrent treatment and training may   be provided, referred, to in last month&apos;s Report, is being proceeded with and, from the replies received, it appears that one or two centres will be necessary.25* Refusal,of Treatment. The following figures show what has been done during June with respect to those men who have refusedtreatment:-

Numbers under Treatment.   Appendix  VIII shows the number of men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements made or approved by the Ministry and to whom maintenance allowances are being paid.   It will be seen that 14,660 cases were admitted for treatment and that 8,110 cases were discharged from Treatment during the month ended the 25th June 1919, and that 81,983 men were under treatment on that date, as compared with 75,433 men at the end of the previous month.   The total number of cases which have been given and are being given treatment under the Ministry of Pensions is 174,198.The Appendix shows also the nature of the disablements for which treatment was required, and that 39.4$ of the cases are of wounds or injuries,   The number of discharged men in Lunatic Asylums who have been admitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports was 3,483 on the 25th June.   Of theso 146 had been admitted during the month.27&apos;   Officers&apos; Treatment.  &apos;.(1)   Treatment of released Temporary Officers.   The Treasury have approved7&quot; aii^agreemelrt&quot; between the War Off Tee and the Ministry whereby the medical treatment of temporary officers released from Military duty, but still Liable for service if the need should arise, will devolve on the Ministry of Pensions instead of the Army Council.
28*   Training of Widows.    Up to the end of June, 1084 war-widows have appliecFfor&quot;training.     In 478 cases training has been sanctioned and 170 widows have completed their training.    With the assistance of the Special Grants Committee 45 Officers&apos; widows havo been trained or are under training (Appendix X).INTELLIGENCE NOTES.29*   Australia, Consolidation of Pensions Law.    Owing to numerous amendments of the Principal Act the Australian War Pensions Acts of 1914, 1915 and 1916 have been officially consolidated into the form of a single Act.   k30.   South Africa..    A Report has been issued by a Select Committee o^the House of Assembly of the Union of South Africa. In view of the complicated state of the&apos; law relating to War Pensions, the Committee recommend a consolidated War Pension Act and submit a Draft Bill.     The Bill is based largely on the &quot; Royal Warrant but deals not only with officers, as well as men, but also with the claims of Burghers (on both sides) in previous wars,.    The main new features of the Bill are that after 5 years from&apos;the date of the first award a temporary pension must be made permanent, and the setting up of an Appeal Board to decide pension claims (other than the assessment of a disablement pension) In the course of the evidence before the Committee attention was drawn to the difference between the maximum alternative pension of an officer ( 450) and the maximum alternative pension to an N.C.O. or soldier ( 260) and it was strongly urged that where the pension was based upon pre-war earning capacity the maximum should, bo the sane in every case.     The Committee, however, did not accept the suggestion.      It was also pressed that pensions should be statutory, but even those who put forward this view appeared to recognise tho risk attendant on bringing pension claims before the Courts, and the Committee contented themselves with proposing the Appeal Board.     Clauses 56 and 37 of the Bill dealing with the Appeal Board are attached hereto as Appendix XI,x   Tho Canadian Government have, so far, made &amp;n annualconsolidation of the Orders in Council relating to Pension(2)   Maintenance allowance a (hiring Treatment,.    The Treasury havo sanctioheTTlae &apos;Mini&quot;atry*s &quot;proposals (in ^rtendwtorjrt:, of Article 6 of tho Officers&apos; Warrant) as follows:-(a) That in special circumstances maximum retired pay may be given to an Officer (whether married or single) who is certified to bo incapable of work and for whom non-institutional treatment is recommended by the Authorities.(b) That in the case of an officer receiving institutional treatment, an allowance not exceeding  50 a year may be granted to the wife, or an allowance not exceeding  40 a year to a dependant relative (as defined in the Royal Warrant of 1st August, 1917); provided that in either case there is pecuniary need.(c) That a Clause be inserted in the Royal Warrant similar to Article 6 (5) of the Men&apos;s Warrant, the maximum allowance to bo  1 instead of 10/- a week,(3)   Numbers under Treatment,    Appendix IX shows in detail the number of&quot;&quot;oriTcers TJeglnning and ending treatment during June, and the disabilities for which treatment is being provided.
rti r\ 221.31..   Franc e *.1 (1) g ofigaul e of percentages for specific injuries &amp;c .The^aore^irfrectea under tne irrehcn tensions law of 31stMarch, 1919. fixing tho percentages of disability to be awardedfor specific injuries and certain diseases has been compiledby a committee composed of 11 eminent medical and&apos;dental authorities.The Table goes into considerable detail and fills 27 columns ofthe Jounral Offlciel - about 40 times as long as the Schedule of specific injuries in the Royal Warrant.   For example, whereas inour Schedule only 9 injuries to the hands and fingers are given,the French Table contains 111 different cases of hand and fingerinjury, and giveB not only&apos;the percentage of disability for theright hand, but also in most cases for the left as well.   Insome cases trivial injuries are mentioned where the percentages of disability are. fixed at from 0 to 1, but under the FrenchLaw there is special provision under which the percentage is increased where a man suffers from several disabilities.Ihe French percentages are much the same as those in the Schedule to the Royal Warrant, being occasionally 5% less or 5%. more; simple loss of sight of one eye, however, is put as low as 25% in contradistinction to our 50$.The detailed but simple directions in the French Table will not only be a means of fixing promptly the correct percentage of a manfs disability but will tend greatly to uniformity of practice.(2) Training of War ftidows.   A decree haB been issued providing for the vocational training of widows in receipt of a war pension.32.  .   United States of America.   In last month&apos;s Report it was shown how the Elks had endeavoured to fill the hiatus befrnwn the Pensions Bureau and vocational training; to judge from a note on training to be found in Appendix XII hereto the Pensions Bureau take such a strict view of their functions that a considerable number of disabled men fail to receive the benefits intended by the Rehabilitation Act.   To meet this difficulty a Bill has been introduced to provide for the training of all disabled men (Appendix Xlt). .33.      Italy.   Pension Numbers.   The monthly Italian figures for pensions claimed and settled are stated by the Economista d^Italia to be as followsDec.1918* Jan.1919.

Germany ;(1)   The Ludendprff Fund..   This Fund which corresponds largely to the King&apos;s Fund and which was initiated at the same time as the King&apos;s Fund has, reached the sum of 150,000,100 marks (7i millions sterling at,pre-war rates of exchange).   The Fund was only in proaess of collection for a few months.(2)   Organisation of Disabled Men. Efforts to unify.the organisations of disabled soldiers has. been brought to a successful conclusion in Cassel, where a large Association has been formed composed of the Economic Unions of disabled Soldiers whose headquarters are at Cassel-and Berlin.   The-Association will preserve complete neutrality in religious and political matters

War Pensions Gazette   The July issue contains an interesting article on the marvellous cures which are being effected in the case of men suffering from functional disorders (Appendix XIII).37,   Numbers of Staff,   The increase in the Staff during June was 336, last month it was 380.   The large decrease of 852 in the V Branch is due to the fact that that Branch is ceasing to exist as a separate Branch and its staff is being absorbed in the Awards to Soldiers1 Branch which is talcing over its Vfork.   The details of increase and decrease in each Branch are sho:m in Appendix XIV.   The whole Staff of the Ministry consists of 2,241 mon and 11,87$ women, or a total of 14,116.The daily percentage of absence during June was 1.6 for men and 3,7 for women. -38.

Circular 18WMINISTRY OF PENSIONS, Secretary&apos;s Ofeice, Westminster House,Millbank, London, S.W. 1.4 /i Jitfy, 1919.Payment of 20 per cent. Bonus on RecoverableAdvances and on Advances under Circular 34.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to state that he has had under consideration the practice of paying Recoverable Advances, and Advances to Widows under Circular 34, without phe addition of the 20 per cent. Bonus, and that he has now decided to authorise the payment of the bonus with these advances in all cases where they are made in anticipation of a pension or allowance which will itself carry bonus. Payment may commence as from the 12th instant.This concession, it will be observed, applies to all recover-able advances made to (a) discharged disabled men to whom pensions have been awarded ; (b) demobilised men and claimants under Article 9 whose cases are under consideration ; and (c) men appealing to the Appeal Tribunal. It will also apply to advances to widows under Circular 34 where made at Article 11 rates; but inasmuch as pension under Article 17 is payable without bonus it will not apply to advances at Article 17 rates.Advances in all these cases obviously involve risk of loss to public funds in so far as any of the cases.may not ultimately be found entitled to pension. In allowing therefore the addition of bonus the Minister desires to impress upon all Local Committees that notification of the case must be sent promptly as soon as the first advance is made, so that early arrangements may be made for bringing it to a settlement.Advances at treatment allowance rates under Circulars 178 and 179 are included in the concession^ and references to pay-ment of these advances &quot;without war bonus &quot; may now be disregarded. The&apos; last paragraph of Circular 141 is hereby cancelled. .I am, Sir,. Your obedient Servant,

Awards shall be made upon the recommendation of that Board, subject to confirmation of the Minister.The Board appointed prior to the passing of this Act for the purpose oK? dealing with claims shall be deemed to have been appointed under this section.Appeal Board37. (1)   Where an applicant for a pension or the Treasury is dissatisfied with-a decision of the Pensions Board an appeal may be taken by either party, with the leave of the Pensions Board, to an Appeal Board consisting of a soldier who has served not less than two years in the present war, an advocate of ten years&apos; standing, and the Secretary for Finance, or his alternate.   But no appeal shall be allowed against the assessment of any disablement pension.(2)   The Appeal Board may call in an assessor to assist it in determining questions affecting the earning capacity of an applicant for alternative pension and such at-sessor shall for the purposes of the case for which he is called in be a member of the Appeal Board.(3)   Not less than three members of the Appeal Board (including any assessor) must be present at the hearing and decision of an appeal.(4)   A decision of a majority of the Beard shall be the decision of the Board, and in case of equality the Chairman shall have a casting vote as well as a deliberate vote.The provisions of Clause  even35 shall apply.h   This is Section 14 of the YJar Pensions (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1918, compelling employers to r ive information as to pre-war earnings.
APPENDIX XII.D.S    .     TRADE TRAINING- FOR THE DISABLED.To meet the situation arising from the fact that a discharged soldier is not entitled to vocational training&apos; unless his- disability is such that he is receiving compensation payments from the Viar Risk Bureau, Senator Kenyon of Iowa, with the approval of the Treasury Department, is introducing a Bill which&apos; provides for the training of all disabled soldiers.   Every effort will be made to expedite its passage.Out of about 70,000 men who have applied for compenea-tion only 20,000 have so far been awarded it.   This percentage will eventually be considerably increased, but it is believed that many thousands vino ought to have educational assistance will not b.e able to get it under the laws as they now stand.   A soldier cannot obtain compensation unless his injury impairs his earning capacity 10 per cent, nor vocational training unless he has been allowed compensation.The theory of compensation is carried so far in practice that if a disabled soldier should by any chance receive more income during his training than he formerly had his com-penaation is withdrawn, whereupon his training automatically, ceases.   Many - cases have also been reported of men having their compensation reduced because they were earning money during training.   The result is that what is called &quot;placement&quot; training, is becoming almost impossible.By &quot;placement&quot; training is meant the training of disabled men by putting them at work in some regular establishment where they learn a trade.   They are received as apprentices and get apprentices pay..   &apos;mhen the War Rio a. Bureau finds that the -placement&quot; man is thus earning something, his compensation is revised, or withdrawn altogether.   The net result is that one agency of the Government is destroying what the other builds up.At present men who are certain to be.granted compensation often wait months for the formal award.   In the meantime they are not entitled to training.The Lenyon bill will separate vocational training from compensation considerations and will rest on the broad ground that any man who suffered impairment from injury or disease while in-service shall be entitled to the former...

Their A Good     Majesties talked with many, and I Combination. saw the finished results of all thatdevotion and energy which has been expended towards helping the disabled fighter to a new life. The organisers and instructors are to be congratulated. The men are to be congratulated. To walk, even by the aid of an appliance, when you are paralysed; to write excellently with your left hand; to make boots for the Prime Minister when you were originally a butcher these are no mean accomplishments. Added to which there was the initial victory over pain and despondency. The combination of help and effort has done it. Through tedious painful stages from casualty clearing station to workshop this combination has won through, and will win through. The particular merit is not in making boots for the Prime Minister, but, being disabled, in learning to make boots. This merit is shared by-those who have helped,The letter from Sir Eobert Home which was read at the Annual Conference of the National Federation of Discharged and De-Ginger and mobilised Sailors and Soldiers de-Reason, tailed action which is being taken for the benefit of ex-service men. This includes instructions to Labour Exchanges regarding a preference to applications of men who have served ; a scrutiny of Government offices; arrangements whereby a certain proportion of disabled shall be provided with suitable employ-ment in each trade. To the last of these three the Minister of Labour foreshadowed that Par-liament will be asked to give special considera-tion. The building schemes of the Government and Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s representation to the Housing Conference of Local Authorities for the employment of ex-service men, were also enume-rated. What was asked in return was some patience. Now, patience to men who want to &quot; get down &quot; to work is not an easy quality; but the difficulties of this time of transition cannot be ignored. Let the &quot;, gingering-up &quot; process go on. It helps. But let it be coupled with reasoned appreciation of what has to be done to get the machine running again.The Select Committee on Pensions, continuing its sittings during the Whitsuntide recess in the hope of being able to present a The Select   report in July, has extracted many Committee, suggestions from recent witnesses.Sir Arthur Pearson protested against officers being debarred from the special blind grant, unless blinded in action: he estimated the disability due to loss of one eye at 25 percent. Mr. Alex. Wilson, Chairman of the Dependants&apos; Sub-Committee of the Belfast Local War Pen-sions Committee, advocated an ingenious system of units as the basis for awards: Man three units, woman two units, child one unit, rent,
light and heat one unit. Mr. Walter Peel, of the Disablement Sub-Committee of the Liverpool War Pensions Committee, suggested improvements in training allowance and the allowance for illness within six months of dis-charge. The evidence of these, as of other witnesses, disclosed the extraordinary complexity of the pensions problem ; and, though each indi-vidual suggestion has its value as a pointer to some new aspect, it is as well to remember that each new ruling has to be hammered out of existing regulations, and contingencies past and future.Of other witnesses, Mr. Mathew, Chairman of the Special Grants Committee, threw doubtupon the medical basis as the final More basis for awards instancing that Complexities, the same injury might not mean the same disability in two different trades : also that a BO per cent, earning capacity, which is assumed with a 70 per cent, disability, might, in the actual labour market, prove ficti-tious. More complexities ! Mrs. Woods, Secre-tary of the London War Pensions Committee, corroborated this, to some extent, in her evidence concerning the man for whom employment was almost impossible to find, citing as instance the man whose physical strength had been his one asset. Captain H. C. Baird, Editor of the Ex-Service Man, sounded, a note which might well be repeated incessantly: that humanising of the State machine, be it ever so perfect, was most essential and that humanising must come from the nation. Mr. W. G. Williams called for a Bill compelling employers of over twenty-five men to take a percentage of disabled men. Was such a Bill foreshadowed in the Labour Minis-ter&apos;s letter quoted above ?Finally might be mentioned, not by any means because it is the least important, Mr. F. L.Floud&apos;s statement that the Board Help for the of Agriculture had acquired 14,000 Machine,    acres and was in negotiation for20,000 more; also the result of eighteen months&apos; working of 2,500 acres in York-shire by ex-service men a net profit of ^600. A small thing in itself, but significant. From all of which it will be seen that though the com-plexities are many, the brains trying to solve them are many also. Some at least of these problems will solve themselves-and that quickly  if the hint given by Captain Baird can be promulgated far and wide. To quote him again : &quot; The State can do mo more than set up a -machine.&quot; A machine which, many look upon as a sort of Aunt Sally at which to shy. This, perhaps, is not unuseful. But having had their shy, let them look to see whether their own neighbourhood and officials are doing the most they can to fill the gaps that must occur between State administration and individual needs.  Wedo not refer to charity or distribution of voluntary subscriptions.       , .      *We print elsewhere two statements side by side on the present question of the employmentof women or men ex-service men. or &quot;Sen,    An absolutely impartial solutionseems indefinable. When all the individual cases of necessity and hardship have been allowed for, there remains the general claim of the man who went out to fight and has now returned-requiring employment. Having proved that claim to be irrefutable, even to the exclusion of women, we at once come up against the claim of the women who were asked to come forward and did so. So back again round the circle of argument. It is almost as if women, in relation to work, were now in the position men were, in relation to serving, prior to compulsion; which leaves it to their personal decision. We can con-ceive the ex-sergeant-major, turned cynic by an enforced emulation of the old-style corner-boy, delivering himself somewhat in this wise : &quot;If women are to go on working indiscriminately, men should be allowed to go on fighting ditto.&quot; That brings us to a reductio ad absurdum-ov a tragedy.Appointments.During the past month the following changes have taken placePROMOTIONS :-Mr. W.

SEALE HAYNE MILITARY HOSPITAL.Tho Wonders of Neurology,&apos; By Wm. S. London.It  was with the greatest pleasure that I visited   the   Seale Hayne Military Hos-pital, Newton Abbot, on   behalf   of   the Middlesex War Pen-sions Committee, with a view to reporting upon  the wonderful Patients Basket-making.      cures  &quot; of    functional disorders which had been effected in that insti-tution.To be perfectly frank, I must confess I should regard the writer of such an article as a person who was drawing upon his imagination for his facts, had I not seen with my own eyes the events I have the privilege to relate.On the day of my visit the hospital was being inspected by General Sir Victor Cooper and General Lane; and Lieutenant-Colonel A. F. Hurst, E.A.M.C., the Officer Commanding, con-ducted us over the building.One of the first cases we saw was that of a paralysed mute, who had just been admitted. He had been paralysed in his legs for two years, and was quite dumb. He had received various kinds of treatment, but when I saw him he could neither stand nor speak, nor could he even fashion a word with his lips. He was lying helpless on his back. To give some idea of his condition, he was taken out of bed and, supported by two doctors, was allowed to place his feet on the ground. The doctors then withdrew their-support, and the man immediately collapsed. We caught him and again stood him in an upright position, when he fell forward on to the bed, into which he was at once lifted.The treatment then commenced. One of the doctors, with a sympathy which left a marked impression upon us all, told the man to cough, which he did; this was repeated about four times. The doctor then showed the man how to cough and at the same time articulate the word &quot; one.&quot; This the man succeeded in doing after two or three attempts. He was then taught to say &quot;two,&quot; and &apos;then &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot; together in the same breath ; and so oh, up to the word &quot;ten.&quot; He then pronounced his name. All this time the doctor had been uttering words of encouragement, such as &quot;Thatfs splendid ! &quot;-&quot;You said that perfectly &quot;  &quot;Your voice is coining back; here it comes; now you will soon hear yourself speak.&quot; At these words the man had some difficulty in controlling his emotion, and incidentally, I might remark that he was not alone in this respect. He concluded by saying &quot;It&apos;s a long way to Tipperary,&quot; as well as I can say it, and his voice was completely restored to him. The time taken was ten minutes.We then left this man in the doctor&apos;s care and proceeded to another patient. Just before lunch the Colonel suggested that we should pay another visit to the paraplegic mute and ascer-tain how his treatment was progressing.. We saw the man walking quite steadily up and down the corridor, to the evident joy both of himself and his wife, who was also present. In the afternoon they went out together for a short stroll.We had heard a dumb man speak and seen a paralysed man walk. The time occupied to effect the former was ten minutes, and to effect the latter about an hour and a half.Another man could only whisper. It was very difficult to hear what he said. Voice restored in our presence.   Time, about seven minutes.We saw a man bent nearly double as the result of nephritis. He was in great pain and the whole of his body was trembling. He had been in this condition for just over a year. He arrived at Seale Hayne that morning. We entered this man&apos;s room with a doctor, at 12 noon. When we left him at 12.20 the man&apos;s body was upright, the pain had vanished, and he was running up and down one of the corridors, very, very pleased with himself.Another patient had been wounded in the neck. This man could not move either his hand or arm. He was told that electrical and massage treatment for at least nine months would be necessary before he would be able to use either. The man was admitted to Seale Hayne hospital that morning, and partly cured in my presence and completely cured before 1 p.m.Perhaps the most important and most remark-able case was that of a man who for two years had been completely paralysed in the&apos; face, the body and the limbs. He could not move, or at least he thought he could not. Everyone who had seen him was of the same opinion; and the necessary papers were actually made out for his early admission to the Star and Garter Hospital, as he
was regarded as being hopelessly and permanently paralysed. This man was sent for during the afternoon.He entered the room a cured man, and showed us how easily he could run. He was able to move the muscles of his face, and he could write his name and address. Incidentally I may mention that he is shortly to be married, and he received the congratulations and best wishes of all present.The above are a few examples of what has been done by neurologists at this hospital.As Colonel Hurst says : &quot; A symptom caused by obvious injury or disease may be perpetuated after the original organic condition has dis-appeared, so that it ends by being entirely functional, and being functional, is curable by persuasion, re-education and suggestion the three methods of psychotherapy. Numerous soldiers have been invalided from the Service with a useless hand or arm, which will remain useless for the rest of their lives unless the func-tional nature of the incapacity is recognized.&quot;The following table shows the result of the treatment given at the Seale Hayne Military Hospital in 100 consecutive cases of hysterical contractures and paralysis following minor wounds and injuries : Nature of Injury	Ann	LegG.S.W............	23   .	.   26&apos;  ,,     with fracture...  .   ..	.   16   .	..   1&apos;,,     with amputation	.    4   .	..  -,,     and tetanus.....	.    1   .	.   1Fractures (without G.S.W.) ..	.3 -..	2Amputations     ,,	.    1  .	.    1Contusions	.    2   .	.   10Dislocations	.    1   .	.

Average time required fifty-four minutes. Duration of treatment in other cases-four weeks, threeweeks (2), and four days.That the importance of this form of treatment is fully recognised by the State is evidenced by the fact that the following special hospitals have been established for the treatment of officers and soldiers suffering from functional nervous disorders, while others are in contemplation : Chepstow Hospital, Mon. Brinningham Hospital. Altrincham (Officers) John Leigh Hospital. Woodburn, John Leigh Hospital. Allerton Towers, John Leigh Hospital. Exeter, Streatham Hall Hospital. Stainbeck Hospital, Leeds. Leicester Frith Hospital. Craigavon Hospital, Belfast. Leopardstown Park Hospital, Dublin. Craigend Hospital, Edinburgh,Bray Court, Maidenhead.. Oulton Hall, Leeds.Flounders Institute, Aokworth School, nr. Pontefract.The special medical board at 78, Lancaster Gate, is the discriminating authority on this subject and decides as to the form of treatment required by each man who comes before it and as to the particular institution where such treatment should be given.Pottery Work, at Scale Hayne.Quite recently I had a man living in the area of my Committee who had been gassed and who had lost his power of speech in consequence thereof. I sent him to the special medical board and his voice was restored to him in less than an hour.The Ministry of Pensions has instituted a system whereby the medical papers of each man who is discharged are examined by a neurologist to ascertain whether his invaliding disability may or may not be of a functional character, in order that on his being reboarded, he may be recom-mended for appropriate treatment.The Seale Hayne hospital is now closed. But the Ministry of Pensions, being desirous that the highly-qualified medical and nursing staff should not be scattered to the four corners of the United Kingdom, are making arrangements whereby the staff will be transferred to a London hospital, thus providing in the metropolitan area additional facilities for the treatment of functional disorders.We are asked to state that the assistance of Local War Pensions Committees is required to secure a wider distribu-tion for the new four-page leaflet entitled &quot; War Pensions.&quot; Each Committee, it is thought, should be able to place from 1,000 to 5,000 copies among the people who desire to have the information contained in this leaflet,
A Chance for Children. By a Correspondent.&apos; The arrangements made by the Army Children&apos;s Homes Committee in co-operation with Special Grants Committee for the admission to the Heritage Craft Schools, Chailcy, Sussex, of children of serving and ex-serving soldiers suffering from surgical tuberculosis, are now completed.A resident Medical Officer, Dr. Horton, who has had exceptional experience of the special treatment required by these children, has been appointed. Already over thirty children are installed.The schools are in a splendid position, high up on the Sussex Downs, and every facility is provided for the education and training of the children who are admitted at any age. When they are ready to leave Chailey, good openings are found for them in the, trade or occupation for which they show an aptitude. Indeed, it has been said that some firms prefer a crippled boy or girl from Chailey to an able-bodied child who has been educated-&apos; in the usual way! There are Montessori teachers for the babies; splendid workshops for the older boys; gardening and farming instruction for the children who ought to lead an put-door life.There is room for a total number of 150 children; and it is hoped that Local Commitees will make the most of this opportunity.  Sometimes&apos;the parent or guardian is quitenaturally reluctant to let a child go to a residental school. But when the Tuberculosis Officer and the Local Committee agree that it will be in the child&apos;s interest to receive&apos; treat-ment and training of this special kind which can be extended for so long as is necessary they will doubtless be able to persuade the family to take advantage of the chance.The Army Committee intended originally to deal only with total orphans and motherless children, but they have now decided to extend their generous arrangements, in special cases, to children whose parents are both living, until the vacancies are required for motherless children to whom priority will be given.Now that the arrangements are complete, every Local Committee in England and Wales should apply at once for the admission of any child whom the treatment is likely to benefit.Sailors&apos; children are not eligible, under the Army Children&apos;s Homes Committee Scheme. But the Special Grants Committee will always be glad to advise, and, if possible, - assist in securing residential treatment for any sailor&apos;s child who, in the opinion of the Local Committee, is likely to benefit from the treatment and training provided at Chailey.Things Done.Paragraphs -for this&apos;column should reach the office not later than the 15th of the, month.  They should not exceed sixty words.&apos;- Under the auspices of the&apos;Hostels Committee of the Eccentric Club the James Lotery Hostel has been opened for disabled soldiers, at Durwafd Street, London, E. 1. The building was taken over and equipped by Mr. James Lotery.An exhibition of carving, furniture and cabinet making by disabled soldiers, has been held at Wycombe. The exhibits were the work of men under training in the Technical Schools.A matinee, organised by Madame Bertha Moore, O.B:E., in aid of Lord Roberts&apos; Memorial Fund for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors, has been held at the West End Cinema, London.In Belfast the making of naval and military gold lace and embroidery has been added to occupations for which training is provided for disabled service men,The Eccentric Club entertained 200 limbless men from Queen Mary&apos;s Hospital, Roehampton, at the Derby.Lady Kathleen Pilkington, of Chevet Park, Wakefield, has offered the West Riding Local War Pensions Com-mittee to provide an institution for convalescent treatment of discharged soldiers up to 100 men. Lady Kathleen Pilkington is appealing for subscriptions to assist.Farms amounting to 1,524 acres have been acquired in Argyllshire and Ross-shire for the settlement of ex-service men. In Caithness 3,000 acres have been purchased, and in Sutherland 18,200 acres were available for the same purpose. .- The Kent County Council has agreed to purchase 488 acres of land to meet the applications from ex-service men. This does not exhaust the applications.Temporary Staff Association.  By a Correspondent.With full concurrence of the authorities at the Ministry of Pensions, an Association to promote the welfare of the temporary staff has been registered and is now in full swing. In the Ministry of Pensions there are approxi-mately 10,000 temporary employees, and the Association already boasts pf having some 8,000 as members. The Association, which is registered as the Ministry of Pensions (Temporary Staff) Association has, at the present, only accepted as members the temporary staff of branches at London Headquarters; but a scheme is being prepared whereby staffs of local committees throughout Great Britain and Ireland may be admitted to the membership roll.The Association has elected as their first President Mr. Bernard G- Kaufman, late secretary to Guildford (Surrey) Local War Pensions Committee, and an official of the Special Grants Committee, and Mrs. E. Kenyon, of the Widows and Dependants Branch, has been appointed Vice-President. Lady Cynthia Colville, of Soldiers Award, Chelsea, shares with Mr. Pilley, of the Pension Issue Office, and Mr. A. Radcliffe, of the Separation Allowance Branch, the duties of Trustees, whilst the post of General Hon. Treasurer has been accepted by the original founder of the Association, the Rev. W. Marshall Carrington of the Medical Services Branch. Mr. William Haigh, of the Pension Issue Office, Baker Street, also one of the original founders, has now become the Hon. Legal Adviser.Neither sex nor grade is taken into account for election to any office on Committee or Council. Thus the President is an ex-Subaltern and the Secretary an ex-Brigadier : of the Trustees one is an ex-private soldier, and members of the Council include junior girl clerks, chief lady supervisors and chief controllers of Ministry Branches.To cope with the extension of work,- the Executive Council was obliged to take Central Offices at 87, Chancery Lane, where the newly-appointed General Organising Secretary, Brigadier-General W. B. Hulke, D.S.O., is now installed.Branches are arranged according to geographical position and each branch has its own officials and Committee. A special branch of ex-service men, temporarily employed at the Ministry, has been formed. In order that members of the Association may be regularly kept acquainted with what is being done in their interest, official printed circulars are sent at regular periods to each member showing work done.In view of General Sir Henry MacKinnon and Mr. D. Hendy having tendered their resignations as Hon. Secretary and Treasurer, respectively, to the Headquarters (Ministry of Pensions) War Savings Association, the authorities of the Ministry have asked the Staff Asso-ciation to undertake this work; and the Council have appointed their President and General Secretary to the posts of Hon. Secretary and Treasurer of the War Savings Association, respectively.
War Pensions Gazette.No. 27.JULY, 1919.TWOPENCE.The Editor will be pleased to consider contributions and photographs, which he will return if unsuitable.Communications for the Editor should be addressed Millbanlc House, Westminster, London, S.W. 1.The Ministry of Pensions does not necessarily endwse opinions expressed by contributors.Communications concerning subscriptions and sales should be addressed to H.M. Stationery Office (addresses as on backpage), or through any Bookseller or Neivsagent.CONVALESCENCE.The period of convalescence is admittedly difficult. The patient frets; and to-day all the world is a patient, convalescent nearly every individual in it after a devastating fever. What more natural than that1 the soldiers-the men who have suffered and endured the actual night-mare of fighting should be most impatient in these first loose, ill-ordered months of Armistice ? Even the cure of actual peace has been wanting.Instances of this impatience have occurred in Leeds, Cork, London-notably London. The ebullition at Leeds was transitory; the men went back to training. The trouble at Cork, when the pensions office was seized, appears to have been due to local dissatisfaction ; the Lord Mayor smoothed out the situation. The dis-turbance in London ended in a regrettable fracas with the police and produced a debate in the House of Commons.Now whatever the immediate reason for these outbursts of irritation, where they are not the results of agitation by men who never were soldiers; the generating cause is impatience.And the causes of this impatience? They were discussed at length in the debate in the House of Commons. Housing conditions and unemployment are the principle irritants: un-employment especially, aggravated perhaps by a belief, viciously fostered by those who are using ex-service men, that wages can and should be Utopian. But out of the enumeration of these and other grievances   grievances of delay, of unfulfilled promises of reinstatement, of individual hardships which were faced by all speakers with sympathy, and by some with a deep feeling of recollection, there emerges a suggestion, that, the claims of our returned fighting men may develop into a contention dividing not only parties but the State. The irony of this possibility is lost in the tragedy of such a relapse, however momentary it might be. How can the position be mitigated?If the sickness of War required our courage and energy, with all else thrown in, the con-valescence of Peace demands, with all else, our supreme understanding and imagination per-haps more difficult virtues; and they need to be mutual. The men need to understand those who really are working to fashion solutions, and something of their difficulties ; all others need imagination to gauge and meet the men&apos;s require-raents. Because these dangers of convalescence, with its distortions, its peevishness, its false strength and its fatigue, are universal.Two passages from the speakers might be taken by all, as they fit their capacity to assist: &quot; The soldier was not a perfect citizen when he went to France and he is probably a good deal less perfect now.&quot;&quot;But I have sufficient faith in the good sense of my comrades to believe that they will soon restore the normal position.&quot;Understanding and imagination for and from the men. Mutual help. That is the remedy for convalescence in a world which is itself only convalescent. But above all else let &quot; both sides&quot; diagnose and counteract the infection which comes from those who would use the ex-&apos; service man. For that way lies a worse fever than war.Personal.Captain C. A. Higgins, B.A., LL.B., has been appointed Secretary to Portsmouth War Pen-sions Committee.The Minister of Pensions has approved the following four appointments :-Colonel H. L. Warden, D.S.O., to be Regional Director for Scotland.Mr. W. E. Hincks, Superintending Inspector, to be regional Director for Ireland (Ulster).Mr. C. A. Pirn, Superintending Inspector, to be regional Inspector for Ireland (South and West).Major B. C. Roberts, O.B.E., to be Regional Director for Wales.Mr. F.

Davies, matron of the King George Hospital for Soldiers, has been appointed Matron-in-Chief under the Ministry of Pensions. Miss M. E. Davies has received the Bar to the Boyal Red Cross.ColonelW. H. Bull, His Majesty&apos;s honorary, surgeon,&apos; has retired from the position of Com-missioner of Medical Services, for the West Midland Region.
WOMEN AND MEN.The question whether women employed during the war should now give place to men, returned from service, is not easily answered. The men have a definite right to claim reinstatement in civil employment which they left to fight. The women have proved. by war-work that they are entitled to larger opportunities for industrial occupation &apos;as a means of livelihood. We rule out the &quot;pocket-money woman.&apos;&quot; To present the question with as little bias as possible we print below a statement of the women&apos;s case by a man, and a statement of the men&apos;s case by a woman.for the women.by c. j. m.one of the easiest jobs in the world is to dictate the sacrifices that other people ought to make, more particularly when the reason for the sacrifice must appeal to everybody. it is extremely simple to lay down as an obvious truism that nothing that we, or more often some-body else, can do for our returned soldiers is too much. in consequence there is a very generally expressed opinion that all women should be compelled to give up the work that they are doing, and, in a vast number of cases, have done all through the war, to return to the lazy luxury of their comfortable homes, and make way for some of our soldiers. it would no doubt be agreed that where the woman had only commenced work from the highest patriotic motives, and at a time when it was absolutely necessary for the work to be done by women, if it was to be done at all, the time has come when&apos; she might very wisely consider whether her country would not be best served by her making way for the men who are now available and for whom work is so difficult to find. as for the &quot; pin money &quot; girl, who is only working for4he purpose of extra pocket money, there is no adequate reason why her services should be retained. but even when these two claims are exhausted it will be found that a very large number remain. the question at once presents itself: why should they remain at work instead of retiring gracefully to their comfortable homes: and the answer is equally obvious. because they have.to.&apos; not the least admirable examples of the war are the women, who without grousing or boasting, took over the task of helping to maintain a home hard hit by the times. in many cases a small permanent income, perhaps just sufficient in peace, dwindled steadily as the cost of living increased ; in others the venturing forth of the man left poverty behind, and it was up to the women of the household to keep matters right. the cost of living has not yet gone down. some of the men will not come back. who is there that would care to say that these women are now to be turned down ? certainly no demobilised soldiers will make any such suggestion. . &apos;new appointments or vacancies, all things being equal or even. fairly equal, ought first to be offered to our men, subject always to the efficiency of the administration.  a large numberfor the men.by b. c.. it is with the greatest diffidence that i, as a woman and one who has not seen active service, try for the moment to imagine myself in the position of an ex-serviceman, disabled or fit, who on his return from foreign service finds himself unemployed, while there are hundreds of women and girls occupying posts which are thought suitable for men.the ex-service man has offered his life and possibly lost a limb or a lung. whether or not his health is impaired, he certainly made the sacrifice indirectly for the women of the empire to whom he naturally looks, in what should be a give-and-take world, for special support.women have been trained and have persevered in the war work which they are now doing; but much of that work was previously carried on by men. the opportunity now arises to make way for the men and to seek training, if need be, in some new sphere of life. they should honour their obligation and realise that so far as the dis-charged sailor, soldier or airman is concerned he has the first claim on every individual in this country which has been saved at such tremendous cost.in these days of new activities and new industries there ought not to be much difficulty for all to find a place. but the man comes first. the ex-service man (a fighter) is full of chivalry; nor has any man the power or wish to turn out indiscriminately those who have carried on in his absence; rather would he and his comrades make some appeal en masse :(1) that statistics should be given of the number of women employed, specifying those who are of necessity wage-earners, and their average earnings.(2) that the employers should represent strongly to the women, many of whom do not realise the gravity of the situation, that the time has come for large numbers to resign.(3) that a special effort should be made to influence public opinion and to satisfy women that on resigning a man&apos;s job other work or training will be forthcoming within a reasonable time.- many women who do not need to earn a living have doubtless become very efficient and absorbed and interested in various jobs. however, no one is indispensable in this world; therefore men can
For the Women.of women are engaged on urgent work which it would take a very considerable time for any newcomer to pick up; and it is very doubtful whether it is fair that those, dependent on the work being properly done for getting their pensions or allowances promptly, should be prejudiced even in order to find work for our soldiers.All that is stated above must be subject to this reservation. It is absolutely indefensible to continue to employ women as against men if the only reason is that salaries may be kept down. &quot; Equal pay for equal work &quot; is now the demand. This cry may be said rather to beg the question as to what is equal work and perhaps a better.if more colloquial way of expressing the same idea is.&quot; pay the job.&quot; All &quot;branches of work ought to have a defined value. Once this has been ascertained it ought not to matter in the least to the employer whether it is done by a man or a woman, always assuming that the output is equal in each case. It is sometimes said that woman is so fragile and prone to ill-health that she ought to be paid less when well and working than otherwise . would be the case. If any particular work proves itself to be of a nature that is apt to break a woman down, that no doubt would go far to show that it would be better done by men and in itself would be a reason for replacing the women; but unless this can be proved in practice the bare assertion that the women are unable for health reasons to produce a man&apos;s output&apos; is hardly a sufficient reason for inflicting grave hardship on a whole section of society to the large proportion of which it does hot actually apply.To sum up, any woman or even any man who is hanging on to work for any reason except that such work is really necessary for them if they are to continue their lives in normal comfort should certainly be encouraged to make way for those to whom employment of some suitable kind is a real necessity. But it seems unfair, and indeed wrong, to dispossess those women whose work is well done, and to whom the salary may mean all that makes life bearable for themselves or others, however much it might conduce to a feeling of satisfaction that the obligation of the State has been recognised to our sailors and soldiers. It is but a poor way out of the present difficulty.True, it will substitute a class who will suffer in silence for a class that has no intention of suffering in silence. But it will not do very much to repair the upheaval of the war. Nor will it satisfy those of us who think that if everybody will practise what they preach there will be sufficient work for all men who require it; and that it can be procured without inflicting hard-ship on a very loyal body of workers who also, have been assured that they were the saviours of their country, and would ever deserve well of the Nation.For the Men.be trained to fill those posts, provided the work is not of a temporary nature and holds some sort of prospects for the future. But it is well known that a number of employers have proved the work of women and girls to be extremely satisfactory.; also that a large proportion of the workers can afford to take lower wages, which reduces expen-diture and discourages the idea of the necessity of resignation.But the man ought to have reason to believe there is a place -waiting for him on his return from&apos; taking his part in helping to save the country, instead of which he has to fight in the labour market for a situation, quite contrary to all the promises made before and during the war by men and women. Naturally a man does not wish to see numbers of unemployed and therefore dis-contented women in the country, much less live with such people; probably he would much prefer -to see his sisters suitably occupied, in which case there would be -less cause for the remark so continually heard from the ex-service man, viz., &quot;I have no use for the modern young woman of to-day.&quot; But there is a soreness in his heart that he is unemployed. Unfortunately these sort of sentiments are not always made known to the modern girl who may be thoughtless, but is only too ready at heart to do her best for the men who were our safeguards; in the nation&apos;s hour of danger.It would indeed be an irony of fate if after the talk concerning,and the sacrifices made&apos;to preserve the homes of England, those homes should be, so to speak, inverted, because the women are work-ing and the men are unemployed.There would be no sympathetic atmosphere in these houses which should be homes if the mothers, wives and sisters were absent the greater part of the day engaged on strenuous work. Moreover it does not tend to render them so capable of playing any real part in-what is specially valued and was so well remembered by those who have been fighting in this war the cherished home life of England.After all, it is the man&apos;s duty to earn the wage. Added to which the country wishes and encourages him to marry ; but the longer he is unemployed the farther will he be from making his career in the world and being in a position to keep a wife. A chivalrous man does not tolerate the idea of his wife working to keep him; and although in the case of a disabled man the woman will frequently be obliged to supplement the earnings, in any distribution of. duties the man&apos;s claim to wrork comes first. If any one has to be idle, it should not be he.Arrangements have now been made for training in the use of artificial arms. Circular 167, printed elsewhere, gives full information.
From Overseas.CANADA.At Courtenay, Vancouver Island, returned soldiers are clearing land for a land settlement to be operated as a community with individual responsibility for holdings. There will be collec-tive marketing of produce. About half the men will be married; and the first work undertaken is the erection of houses for the settlers.The Unconquerable Spirit.Private Norman Falkner, of Saskatoon, Canada, skating, left arm is not behind his back.his proposed legislation provides for a grant of land to ex-service men of the Imperial, Canadian and Colonial Forces who served in a theatre of war outside the country of enlistment. The grant will be 160 acres, with provision for loans up to $7,500 if necessary.AUSTRALIA.Badges have been authorised for issue to the widows, and mothers of all Australian soldiers and nurses who have been killed in action or died on service or who have died after discharge from causes directly attributable to service.SOUTH AFRICA.In order to find employment for returned soldiers Johannesburg is restricting over-time.The British South African Company has decided to provide 500,000 acres, half in North and half in South Bhodesia, for-returned soldiers.FRANCE.The Under Secretary of State for War informed the French Chamber that he proposed to increase the Staff of Pensions officials so as to reduce the delay which was at present experienced in deal-ingwith pensions. The recent Pensions Act had necessitated the re-examination of nearly two million case papers.The French Government has passed a law giving to disabled soldiers a preferential right to situations in the Civil Service and in some industrial and commercial concerns hitherto reserved for soldiers who had served or who had re-enlisted. The candidates are classed accord-ing to the number of children dependent on them; but of 7,571 so placed, 3,253 were childless.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The Treasury Department of the United States Government has approved regulations governing the conversion to standard life insurances of war-time term insurances taken out by soldiers and sailors since the United States entered into the war. The policies given in exchange are ordinary life, 20 payments life, 30 payments life, 20 and 30 year endowments and endowments payable at age 62. They provide, further, that the insured will be paid for life a monthly income should he become totally and permanently disabled.Informal conferences of distinguished Allied citizens have been held at Washington on the subject of co-operation between the Allies as regards the rehabilitation of disabled men who are not citizens of the country in which they live and from which they came to fight. A reciprocal plan was suggested, whereby each Allied country would provide for compensation and after-care of men disabled in its service, irrespective of residence after discharge.GERMANY.The German Post Office has given instructions that disabled soldiers shall have preference in filling any situation in the postal service which can be considered at all suitable for them. Severely disabled men are to have first consideration.The President of the German Government has stated that the preparation of an effective law for compulsory employment of disabled men is already in preparation.
Correspondence.The Disabled Fighter.To the Editor &quot;War Pensions Gazette.&quot; Sir, Many of the problems raised by the war will give us plenty to do for a long time. One of these problems is that of the re-education of the disabled man, so as to enable him to hold his own when he gets back to civil life. He does not want to be beholden to anyone for charity, and we as a nation do not want to offer him anything savouring of charity. The Army scheme of education in the hospitals is intended to secure educational advantages for him whilst he is still free from the grim economic struggle, which so often becomes a drama of the survival of the fittest.An education officer and several assistants are already at work in the hospitals of Northumberland and Durham; but they of themselves can only touch the fringe of the matter. The War Office, by their vocational training scheme in hospitals, aims at giving men the opportunity of getting into touch with modern machinery at first hand, of studying for college, university, and the civil service.This cannot be done without the help of the civil popula-. tion the employers of labour, the owners of factories, machine-shops, business premises, the corporations,, the tramway and electricity undertakings, the farmers, the local education authorities, the teachers, the men and women with special knowledge who can impart that knowledge to others. All can help; and it is that help for which we now appeal on behalf of patients. * They want help; they want to be made fit for work.Yours, &amp;c,D. Wells Patterson, Lt.-Col. R.A.M C. (T.), O.C., Special Military (Orthopaedic) Hospital. Newcastle-on- Tyne.Circular 160.       -To the Editor &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot;Dear Sir, I enclose herewith two Resolutions which were passed by my Committee at their Meeting at the Guildhall, Westminster, on the 3rd inst. It was thought by my Committee that these Resolutions might be of some interest to you.Yours faithfully,William S. London. Guildhall, Hon. Secretary, Middlesex WarWestminster, S.W. Pensions Local Committee.Absolutions passed by the Middlesex War Pensions Local Committee at Meeting hkld.at the Guildhall, Westminster, on 3rd Junk, 1019.(I) &quot;That this Committee considers that Circular 169 should be altered, and that Local or Sub-Local Committees should be allowed to issue grants under careful supervision for any extra clothes officially certife! to be re-quired for discharged or demobilised sailors or soldiers at Sanatoria or other Institutions.&quot;(2) &quot; That as certain surgical appliances and artificial limbs are the cause of men&apos;s clothing being worn out sooner than would otherwise be the case, this Committee urges the Minister of PenMons to authorise Local Committees to make grams under careful supervision, to enable men to replace garments worn out by these means.&apos;We are enabled to print the reply from the Ministry of Pensions to the above resolutions. Ed. W.P.G.12231/M.S. 2. June 21, 1919,Sir, I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to refer to your letter of June 4, containing two resolutions passed by your Committee relative to the provision of clothing for discharged disabled men.With regard to the first resolution which has reference to clothing in the case of men undergoing treatment, I am to explain that the Ministers powers in this connection are governed by Article 6 (3) of the Royal Warrant, which authorises the payment of any charges, fees or expenses in respect of treatment or training of a disabled man that are not otherwise provided for.It is therefore essential that the provisions for the supply of clothing should comply with the stipulations :-(a) That the clothing is necessary for the man&apos;seffective treatment, and(b) That the supply should be confined to the periods /  during which the man is under treatment.As regards the first of these stipulations, the Minister felt that the conditions of treatment are in certain circum-stances such as to warrant underclothing and great coats being provided. As regards the second stipulation there appeared to be no means of compliance other than to lend the clothing to the men for as long as the conditions&quot; of treatment rendered it necessary.As the proposals contained in your Committee&apos;s Resolu-tion appear to involve clothing being provided to a man as his own property, and therefore to be retained by him when, treatment terminates, the Minister directs me to advise you that it would be exceeding the powers conferred upon him if he were to authorise the adoption of this procedure in substitution for the provisions of Circular 169.With regard to the second resolution which has reference to men deformed or crippled, I am to say that the dis-ability pension must be regarded as a comprehensive award, and, therefore, as making allowance for every aspect of the man&apos;s condition and all that it involves.I am, Sir, your obedient servant,C. F. A. Hore, Asst. Secretary.The Secretary, Middlesex War Pensions Committee,Guildhall, Westminster. -Soldiers&apos; Small Holdings.To the Editor &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot;Dear Sir, As an interested reader of your Journal the War Pensions Gazette, I respectfully beg to ask if you could show me the front door to enable me to obtain a small holding with a cottage, and the necessary training to make good on such a holding. I am suffering from gas poison-ing and have been found unfit for further duty as a postal clerk in consequence. All the medical people advise me to live out in the open air.I am given to understand that the Government have purchased a large tract of land called Meathop Plats, Grange-over-Sands, about ten miles from where I live, for the purpose of Soldiers&apos; Small Holdings. I should like to get there if possible. I have consulted the Advisory Com-mittee at, Lancaster with a view to the necessary training and the obtaining of such a small holding, but they say that they are powerless in the matter, in fact they do not seem to know anything about it, not even the Industrial Training part of it. As my capital is steadily going, I should be grateful to you if you could give me the key tp open the door of this very difficult position.I am, yours, &amp;c,Crag Bank, W. E. Simpson.Carnforth.As regards training, full details are in Board of Agri-culture Publications L S. 9 and F.P.. 467/L 6, obtainable post free from the Board of Agriculture, 72, Victoria-Street, London, S.W. 1.Applications for small holdings and cottage holdings should be made to the Cleric to County Council of-the County in which the land is desired. As regards Meathop Flats inquiry should be made to Lancashire Agricultural Executive Committee, County Offices, Preston. Ed. W.P.G.Distribution of Awards.To the Editor &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot; Dear Sir,-The Salisbury-Divisional Committee wish to draw your attention to what they consider a very unsatisfac-tory alteration in the method of distributing awards to dis-charged disabled men from what was the King&apos;s Fund, and has lately been transferred to the Civil Liabilities Committee. The application for a grant to enable a disabled man to restart in business or employment has still to be made through the Local Committee, and they are requested to investigate the case and forward it, with a recommendation
to the civil liabilities committee; but instead of the award being made through the local committee for them to disburse and be responsible for its being used for the purpose for which the grant was made, under the new regulations the cheque is sent direct to the man, and the committee who forwarded the application are not even informed that an award has been made. this proceedure is particularly difficult to understand, as in a circular issued aslately as april 28 it was pointed out that the grant was not to be handed in cash to the man, and that as much supervision as possible sho\ild be exercised. this com-mittee feel very strongly, that if the application is made through them, the award should also pass through their hands.yours faithfully, Salisbury Divisional Committee, Edith Bknnet,5, St. Ann Street, Salisbury. Member ofDivisional Committee. The matter is already under consideration owing to previous representations. Ed. W. P. G.IN PARLIAMENT.land settlement (ex-servicemen).15 may, 1919.captin loseby asked the parliamentary secretary to the board of agriculture how many acres of land have been secured by the board of agriculture for the purpose of settling ex-soldiers ; how many acres have been secured in particular in patrington, yorkshire, holbeach, lincoln-shire, heath hill, shropshire, pembury, carmarthen; are the soldiers in these colonies working under a director; what are the wages paid and are the proceeds pooled; what happens to the men.at the end of the probation of three years; has the government advanced money to these men to enable them to purchase their own houses; if not, is there any intention so to do; are the colonies already formed to be multiplied; and are these colonies being worked direct from the board of agriculture or is the machinery of the county councils being utilised ?sir arthur boscawen : the total acreage secured by the board is 12,773 acres. the extent of the patrington settlement is 2,866 acres, of the holbeach settlement 1,002 acres, of the heath hill settlement 1,150 acres, and of the pembury settlement 1,345 acres. in the case of the first three the ex-service men work under a director. a director of pembury will be appointed shortly. that settlement is at present in charge of a temporary manager. the wages paid are the current wages of the district. there are two distinct systems under which the settle-ments are worked. patrington is a profit-sharing settle-ment and will be-worked as a whole, whilst the others are being developed on small holding lines and, except for a certain area, retained as a central farm, the land will be equipped and let in small holdings. in the case of a &quot;profit-sharing&quot; settlement the farm profits are divided between capital, management, and labour in proportion to the amount paid out to them in the weekly accounts, but only those settlers who have previously served one year&apos;s probation are entitled to share in the profits. the present scheme provides for a probationary period of one year, but on a small holding settlement, if the applicant proves him-self thoroughly capable and satisfactory, he is sometimes granted a holding after a month&apos;s probation. the board do not contemplate settlers purchasing their homes or holdings and have no power to advance money to them for that purpose.the board hope to acquire additional land for farm settlements, and two other properties have recently been acquired, namely, 2,769 acres at rolleston, in notts, and 2,377 acres at amesbury, in wilts. as a rule, the board intend that the farm settlements shall be controlled by the board through the directors in residence&apos; at each settle-ment.  in some instances, county councils may be askedto undertake the management.  in the case of one small i property of 508 acres the small holdings committee of the county council are acting as the board&apos;s agents. .separation allowance (re-enlistment).mr. W. graham asked the secretary of state for war ,whether men who re-enlist under army orders 4 and 124, of 1919, are ineligible for separation allowance for their wives and dependants unless separation allowance was issuable on december 10th, 1918; and whether such men who are married after that date are to be permanently refused separation allowance ?mr. foster: the answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. as regards the second part, separa-tion allowance is not issuable in respect of a re-enlisted soldier married after december 10th, 1918, unless and until he is admitted to the married establishment.disabled servicemen (accident compensation).major david davies asked the home secretary whether any scheme dealing with the compensation to be paid in respect of accidents to disabled soldiers and sailors has - been agreed upon; whether arrangements have been made with insurance companies for the issue of policies under such a scheme; whether legislation will have to be intro-duced to carry a scheme into effect; and, if so, whether he can give the date upon which the bill will be introduced ?sir hamar greenwood : it is proposed to adopt a scheme on the lines recommended in the report of the depart-mental committee on compensation for disabled sailors and soldiers under theworkmen&apos;s compensation act, 1906. the necessary arrangements with insurance companies and others to give effect to the scheme have been or are being provisionally settled, and a bill the disabled men (facilities for employment) bill-to authorise the home office to ratify the arrangements, was introduced in this house on the 5th instant, and has he^en read a second time.loss of business (compensation).20 may, 1919.major cayzer asked whether the government intends to take any action, and, if so, what, to compensate those men who, having had to join the&apos;forces, have on their return found that their business has been ruined and have not the necessary capital to restart their business ?the minister of labour (sir r. horne): i have been asked to reply to this question. in cases of serious hardship arising from military service the civil liabilities department is authorised to provide financial assistance for the purpose of enabling demobilised officers and men to restart businesses which have been closed while the owners have been serving with his majesty&apos;s forces.commutation of pensions.colonel ashley asked the pensions minister whether he is prepared to extend the principle of commutation of pensions to dependants who can prove that a lump sum would be of more advantage to them to enable them to set up in business or emigrate ?the parliamentary secretary to the ministry of pensions (colonel sir james craig): my right hon. friend is not prepared to adopt this suggestion. apart from questions of principle, commutation would be impracticable, as the pension of a widow or female dependant ceases upon marriage or remarriage. widows desirous of emigrating or setting up in business may apply for a grant from the king&apos;s fund. arrangements can also be make for a three months&apos; advance of pension in emigration cases.disablement pensions (war bonus).lieut-colonel archer- shee asked the pensions minister whether he is aware that men with fourteen years&apos; service who have been discharged disabled and have elected to receive a small permanent pension under article 1163 of the royal warrant in lieu of a gratuity are not being paid the 20 per cent, war bonus on that pension; and
towhether, in view of the fact that these pensions have been granted as much for disablement, as for service, he will consider the grant to them forthwith of the bonus afore-mentioned ?Sir J, Craig: My hon. and gallant Friend will understand that the pension in respect of fourteen yearB1 service or more is not eligible for bonus, nor is a special grant which is given in lieu of pension subject to the 20 per cent, bonus, and therefore in computing the two and making a like pension it is only natural that the same conditions must be observed.Separation Allowance (Widowed Mother).21 May, 1919.Sir L. Harmsworth asked the Secretary of State for War whether a Government separation allowance is issuable in respect of a son to the widow of a soldier in respect of whom she is receiving an alternative pension ?Mr. Forster: The answer is in.the affirmative.Pensions Ministry Staff.22 May, 1919.Sir L. Worthington-Evans (In reply to a question): Of the present headquarter staff of about 14,500 there are 3,020 males. Of these 484 draw J2250 a year or over, sixty-one of these are established Civil Servants, of whom two have served with the forces : of the remaining 423, 78 per cent., or 330, have served with the forces. $Dependent Parents.Mr. Alfred Short asked the Pensions Minister whether the parents of a single man killed in action are entitled without further inquiry to a pension in respect of their son if he was under the age of,twenty-six on enlistment, but if the soldier was over twenty-six on enlistment the parents have to answer, satisfactorily a series of. questions as to their dependence, &amp;c, and generally plead poverty before they can receive a pension.: if so, will he state the reason for this discrimination; and whether he will con-sider the desirability of paying the pension irrespective of the age upon enlistment ?The Minister of Pensions (Sir Laming Worthington-Evans) : Under the Royal Warraut of April, 1918, a claim for parents&apos; pension must be based either on actual de-pendence or on pecuniary need and infirmity or age. Pro-vision has, however, since been made, by means of the 5s. flat-rate pension, to meet the case of the young man who by his early enlistment has been prevented from giving his parents the expected support. But if a man has reached the age of twenty-six without assisting his parents it may reasonably be assumed that he does not intend to do so,&apos; unless and until they are in need and incapable of self-support through infirmity or age, when they become eligible for pension under the Royal Warrant.Demobilised Soldiers (Bonus.)26 May, 1919.Colonel Thorne asked the Financial Secretary to the War Office whether soldiers who have been demobilised since February 1st are entitled to receive the increase in pay granted to soldiers and officers ; and if he will take action in the matter ?Mr. Forster : A soldier who has been demobilised since February 1st is entitled to the bonus from that date if prior to demobilisation he had been temporarily retained for service with the military machinery of demobilisation or in an administrative capacity. If he was not so retained, but was in receipt of pay on the 1st May, he will draw the bonus from that date.Service and Disability Pensions.Major Sir B. Falle asked the Secretary to the Admiralty if he is aware that men of the Royal Navy who have com-pleted time for pension but are also receiving disability pension are not paid their service pension; and if he will see into this matter as soon as possible ?Dr. Macnamara : In the past men invalided for a cause attributable to the Service after completing time for pension received a disablement pension, with additions for service, good conduct badges, or medals and service in chief petty, petty, or leading ratings. In no case was this less than the Service pension. Under a recent decision all men who have completed time for pension will receive their Service pension plus the disablement pension appropriate to the certified degree of disablement, and steps are being taken to make the necessary adjust-ments as soon as practicable.Re-enlisted Men.28 May, 1919.Sir M. Barlow asked the Financial Secretary to the War Office whether supplementary separation allowances and grants are not payable in respect of the voluntarily re-enlisted men in the Army of Occupation, though they con-tinue payable in respect of those whose compulsory service has continued without a break; and whether this in con-trary to the promises made to the re-enlisted men when they volunteered for service on the Rhine ?Captain Guest; Men who re-enlist voluntarily without a break of service are eligible for supplementary grants and allowances under the regulations&apos; of the Special Grants Committee, but men who re-enlist after demobilisation or discharge are not eligible, as stated in para. 5 of Army Order 155 of 1919. This is fully set forth in the conditions of re-enlistment, and I shall be glad if my hon. friend will send me particulars of the promises to which he refers, as I have no knowledge of them.Ex-Servicemen Unemployed.29 May, 1919.Mr. Kennedy Jones asked the Minister of Labour if he will state the number of discharged and demobilised soldiers and sailors who are now on the unemployment list of the Labour Exchanges ; whether he can give the percentages of those who returned to specific employ-ment and of those for whom employment has since been found as compared with the entire total of men liberated from the Army and Navy and fitted to do work of any sort ?Sir R. Horne : On the 9th May, the latest date for which figures are available, the total number of discharged and demobilised soldiers, sailors, and airmen who were regis-tered at the Employment Exchanges as unemployed was 408,491; separate figures for soldiers and sailors apart from airmen are not available. I estimate that about 81 per cent, of the men demobilised from the Navy, Army, and Air Force are now in employment.Belated Claims.2 June, 1918.Mr. Dawes asked the Secretary of State for War whether, where through a bona fide mistake the wife of a soldier has made an insufficient claim for dependent children, she is debarred, if the soldier has been demobilised, from making an effective claim for arrears on the mistake being dis-covered ; and under which Regulation the claim is refused?Captain Guest: The practice has been that separation allowance, being for current maintenance of the children, is issued from date of first application. It is not possible, when an account has been closed by the demobilisation of the soldier, to make the necessary inquiries into belated claims and reopen the account.Demobilised Officers (Education Grants).Sir Henry Harris asked the Minister of Labour how many education grants have been made to demobilised officers; whether the grants are applicable to education at a university and at institutions where a business training is given; and whether officers are allowed to select the institution at which they are to be trained?        , .Sir R. Horne: Up to May 30th, 3,194 educational grants had been approved for the training of demobilised officers and men of suitable educational. promise at universities,
ac. in addition about 800 grants had been approved for courses of training at agricultural institutions or on farms, and 215 grants for business or industrial training. the answer to the last part of the question is in the affirmative, provided, of course, that the selected institution is willing and able to accept the prospective trainee, and that the training offered is of such a kind and on such terms as meet the conditions on which the grants have been approved by the government.demobilisation.3 june, 1919.mr. churchill (in reply to a question): with regard to egypt, i am informed that 1914 and 1915 men are being dispatched approximately as follows : 1914 men: 14,000 in may, and 12,000 in june. 1915 men: 12,000 in june, and 18,000 in july.soldiers&apos; graves (inscriptions).lieutenant-commander kenworthy asked the secretary of state for war if the next-of-kin of soldiers buried in france and flanders will be given the option of choosing a few words for the inscription on the monument marking their graves when new monuments are being set up ?mr. churchill: yes, sir, the imperial war graves corn-mission have arranged for inscriptions chosen by the next-of-kin to be engraved on the headstones at a cost of about 3 d. a letter, whenever desired.ex-service men (employment).4 june, 1919.mr. raper asked the minister of labour what steps are being taken to replace girls temporarily employed in government offices and elsewhere during the war by discharged and demobilised sailors and soldiers; and whether it is not considered desirable to provide such temporary employment for ex-sailors and ex-soldiers pend-ing their securing permanent employment ?mr, baldwin (joint financial secretary to the treasury): i agree that preference should be given to discharged soldiers in filling vacancies for temporary as for permanent appointments and all the departments of the government are doing what is possible to attain this recult.demobilised soldiers (oversea settlement).mr. billing asked the prime minister whether he is aware that many demobilised soldiers who are unable to obtain work in this country are anxious to migrate to our overseas possessions; whether he is aware that they are unable to do so owing to lack of facilities; and whether the govern-rnent are prepared to assist in this matter ?lieutenant-colonel amery: the prime minister has asked me to reply to this question. his majesty&apos;s govern-ment are aware that numbers of ex-service men will wish to settle in other parts of the empire after demobilisation. i would refer the hon. member to my reply of the 8th april as to the facilities which are being offered in this connec-tion. the oversea settlement committee will be ready to consider applications at an early date, and applicants who have been approved will be able to leave this country as soon as the shipping companies can provide them with steamship accommodation and the oversea governments are prepared to receive them. *information (publicity).colonel ashley asked the pensions minister whether he will take steps in the. public press, or otherwise, to bring to the notice of disabled men, widows, and dependants the allowances to which they are entitled, in view of the fact that in some cases those qualified to draw these allowances are not receiving them owing to ignorance of the regulations?sir j. craig: every disabled man and every widow and dependant receives a handbook containing information regarding pensions and allowances. the handbooks are also supplied to local war pensions committees, to hospitalsat home and abroad, to ex-service men&apos;s associations, to various public bodies, and to the general public. posters advising disabled men and widows and dependants to con-suit their local war pensions committee have been dis-played in post offices, in railway stations, and other public places throughout the country. one million copies of a leaflet containing a full explanatory statement on-pensions and allowances are now being distributed through local eommittees, trade unions, trade councils, ex-service men&apos;s associations, regimental associations, and other organisa-tions. the ministry make frequent communications to the press, and continuous publicity is secured through the columns of journals specially devoted to the interests of ex-service men.disabled ex-service men (training).mr. alfred davies (clithero) asked the pensions, minister how many disabled sailors and soldiers have received train-ing in new occupations under the ministry and how many have been placed in employment; and whether he will con-sider the claims of those disabled men who have received training but are not in employment to a continuation of full disability pension pending employment being found?sir r. horne : i have been asked to reply to this question. about 15,600 men have completed training under various training schemes. it is not possible to say how many of these men have been placed in employment. great care has, however, been exercised to train disabled men only in those trades which present good prospects of employment. with regard to the last part of the question, i would point out that a disabled man who is unable to secure employment immediately upon the completion of his training is entitled to receive unemployment donation, in addition to bis disability pension.land settlement (ex-service men).mr. pratt, (in reply to a question); as regards the latter part of the question, the government scheme for land settlement has been brought fully to the notice of service and ex-service men. over 1,000,000 copies of a pamphlet for men and over 250,000 copies of a paniplet for officers, entitled &quot; land settlement in the mother country,&quot; have been distributed through the army council and by the board.recoverable advances.5 june, 1919.colonel mildmay asked the pensions minister whether, under existing arrangements, the widow of a discharged man who has died of his service disability may be left for four or five months to live on her pension without the 20 per cent, bonus, although the amount of the pension, without the bonus, is admittedly insufficient as a living, rate under present circumstances; and, if so, whether some action will be taken in the matter ?sir l. worthington-evans: upon the death&apos; of a dis-charged man, the question of the widow&apos;s entitlement to pension has to be determined, and during the period pf investigation the local committees can make recoverable advances to the widow at pension rate. committees have, not hitherto been authorised to pay bonus with recoverable advances, but i propose to issue an instruction to the committees enabling them to do so in future.Ministry of Pensions Circulars.may 30th, 1919.   circular 167.-instruction in the use of artificial arms. (issue delayed.)It has been reported to the Ministerof Pensions that disabled men who have been supplied with artificial arms are often unable to use them to full advan-tage, owing to the instructions afforded at the&apos;Fitting Hospitals having been inadequate by reason of the pressure of work in those hospitals. The Minister has accordingly arranged with the Army Council that in future every soldier who has lost an aim and who receives an artificial one at a Fitting Hospital may receive one month&apos;s training in the use of the artificial arm before being discharged from the Service. This training will be given at the Fitting Hospital where the arm is supplied. The needs of men at present undischarged will be met in this way.As regards pensioners who have been discharged from the Service without having received adequate instruction in the use of their artificial arms, it has
been arranged with the Army Council than any pensioner who now desires further instruction may receive it up to a maximum period of one month at a Spocial Fitting Hospital where facilities exist. These pensioners will not be admitted to hospital as in-patients for this purpose, but will be treated, as regards allowances and other matters, 011 the same lines as pensioners receiving out-patient treatment.Arrangements for tho pensioners journeys to and from Fitting Hospitals will be made in&apos;accordance with Correction Slip 16 (page 3, par. (0), to &quot;Instructions 011 Treatment, 191S.&quot;Local War Pensions Committees will make the provisions of this circular known to all discharged disabled mon in their area who have received artificial arms from tlio Ministry, and will, on receiving an application from any such pensioner, forward it to the Director of Artificial Limb Supplies, Cromwell House, Millbank, S.W. 1 (marked &quot; Arm Instruction&quot; on envelopo), in order that arrangements may be mado for the pensioners attendence as an out-patient at the appropriate Fitting Hospital.Payments under this circular should be claimed by the Local Committee in their quarterly statement(L.C A/es.

This circular supersedes Circulars 10, 17, 32, 48. 74, 92, 104, 116 and 147 so far as they relate to the Pensions Appeal Tribunal.1. Certain changes have been authorised in the terms of reference to the Tribunal and in the procedure for dealing with appeals, and this Circular is issued for the purpose of setting out clearly in one plase all the information required by Local Committees in connection with these appeals.I.-Cases in which Appeals may br made to the Tribunals. 2.  An appeal may now be made to the Tribunal.by any man who claims to he suffering from a disabilitg^ which he considers to be attributable to, or aggravated by, his service, but which the Ministry has been unable to accept as pensionable. The right of appeal is thus open to(1) Invalided men in respect either of the invaliding disability or of any other disability which has been claimed as attributable or aggra-vated but has not been accepted as suck by the Ministry. (2) Demobilised men who have made a claim at the time of demobilisation or later, which has been rejected by the Ministry on the&apos;&apos;ground that the disability cannot be regarded ai attributable or aggravated. 3.  There is, however, 110 right of appeal to the Tribunal on any other question than that of attribulability or aggravation, and the Appeal proeo-dure is therefore not applicable :-(1) In the case of men whose disability has been accepted by the Ministry as attributable or aggravated, but who are dissatisfied with the amiunt of compensation awarded to them; or (2) in the case of men who claim for the first time in respect of a dis-ability which has not been considered by 1 lie Ministry, e.g., invalided men who claim in respect of a disability arising after discharge, or demobilised men who made no claim at the time of demobilisation. In these cases tho application should be dealt with under Circular 143 or 17S, but there is a right of appeal to the Tribunal if the claim is rejected by the Ministry. 4. The Minister desires to impress on all Local Committees the necessity of satisfying themselves that a man is entitled to appeal to the Tribunal before furnishing him with an Appeal Form.II.-Powers op the Tribunal. 5. It should be clearly understood that once an appeal to the Tribunal has been decided no further appeal can be allowei. It is therefore essential that every care should be taken by appellants to state their cases fully, and that all possible assistance should be given to them by Local Committees in order that no material fact may b&quot; omitted either from the evidence forwarded to tho Ministry, or from the statement made at the hearing of the case. Further representations on appeals which have once been decided can only result in unnecessary expenditure of time and trouble by officials of Local Committees and of the Ministry.Ill,-Procedure to be adopted.6. As the procedure described below differs in some essential points from that hitherto in force, it should be very carefully noted. The object of the alterations is to hasten the decision on appeals, and this object cannot be fully realised by the action of the Ministry without co-operation by Local Committees in carrying out the authorised procedure.7. When a man informs the Local Committee that he desires to appeal to the Tribunal and the Committee is satisfied that he is entitled to do so, he should, be asked to fill up an Appeal Form. 27ns form should be rHained by the Secretary of the Committee, who should forward to the Ministry -(&quot;N&quot;&apos; Branch, Westminster House, in the case of seamen, and &quot;M&quot; Branch, &quot;ort-on Court, in the case of soldiers)&apos; an application for documents on a priority post-card of tho type which is now being specially introduced for the purpose, and of which a specimen is shown at the end of this section, and should indicate clearly on the card that the documents are required in connection with an appeal to the Tribunal, by deleting the other headings on the &quot;card.8. Immediately on receipt of the man&apos;s documents, steps should be taken to obtain the following evidence,4 or as much of it as possible :-(1) Certificate from the man&apos;s ordinary medical attendant as to his health(a) before enlistment and (b) since discharge, the nature and inclu-sive dates of any illness being stated. (2) Certificate from the man&apos;s Insurance Society as to sickness benefits (a)before enlistment and (b) since discharge.        -&apos;- %    -, (As regards this certificate it will be necessary for the man himself to make application to the Society, and it should be impressed upon him that the certificate is an essential part of his evidence and that he must bo responsible for obtaining it. The Committee may assist him in making tho aoplication, but must not themsolves be the applicants or the certificate may be refused,) (3) Certilicato from the &apos;man&apos;s pro-eiili.jtment employer as to the dates ofemployment and time lost through illness. (4) Similar certificate to (3) from the inan&apos;s employer sinco discharge, fl.  Arrangements should then be mado for tho man to appear before a special Sub-Committee of the Local Committee (if possible including the Medical Referee), aril the following should then bo added to the evidence already collected :-Tho man&apos;s own statement as to the origin of his disability or any other relovant facts, this statement being carefully taken down, read over to the man, and signed by him. (li) Certilicato from ihe Medical Referee on form M.U. 4, which should be used in all case except where footnote * applies.Note.-If I ho Medical Referee is unable to sit on the Sub-Committeo the man should be sent sp dully bufore him, and in all ca-es tho Medical Referee should, for 1 he pui-pn-eof his cxamina-tion, be supplied with all the documentary evidence. Should hobo unable to give a Certificate without a Specialists opinion, the following procoduro should bo adopted :-(a) When an X-ray examination and an opinion founded thereon arerequired-Application should be made to tho Director-General of Medical Services, Cromwell House, Millbank, London, S.W.1, for sanction, stating the name and address of the hospital at which the X-ray examination can most conveniently be made. If the Director-General sanctions the application,, he will inform the hospital and tho War Pensions Committee concerned and the lee will be paid to the hospital according to arrange-ments with the British Hospitals Association. The War Pensions Committee will be responsible for sending the man to the hospital and for obtaining the certificate from the Referee after his consideration of tho opinion.(b) When any other specialists opinion is required -The appeal shouldbe sent forward without a specialists opinion. Such opinion, if required, will be obtained by the Appeal Tribunal. 10. The Sub-C mvmittee should consider, this evidence in conjunction with what appears in the documents obtained from the Ministry and in the man&apos;s discharge papers, which are in his possession and which he should in all cases be asked to produce. The Sub-Committee should then record its opinion in the form set out at the end of this section and direct the Secretary to forward it, together with the papers and certificates obtained, to the relevant Branch of the Ministry asVindicated, in the form. . Supplies of the form are in preparation.11. Attention is drawn to the fact that tho right of appeal is no longer forfeited after 30 days from the award of a gratuity, and in the case of appeals made after a longer interval the evidence as to health and employment since discharge is obviously of tho greatest importance. In cases of tuberculosis in particular it is most, desirable that the date and cause of the first visit to a doctor after discharge should be ascertained, and al-o the date on which the case was first notified as one of tuberculosis.12. The Minister considers it necessary to point out that in certain cases there has in the past been great delay in furnishing reports and evidence in connection with appeals, and, while he is aware that this has often been due in whole or in part to causes beyond the control of Local Committees, he is exceedingly anxious that in.future there should be the least possible delay at a stage which is essential to the general speeding up of the treatment of appeals. He would wish Local Committees to aim at despatching their reports not more than 14 days after the receipt of documents, and never to exceed 21 days without a progress report on the case.13. If an appellant fails Jo comply with the Sub-Committe.e&apos;s request for his attendance before them or before the Medical Referee and does not give a satisfactory explanation within a reasonable time he should bo informed that his appeal must lapse, and the papers should be returned to the Ministry with a report of the circumstances.14. If an appellant removes from the district before he has been inter-viewed the papers should be passed to the Local. Committee of the district to which he has removed, and should not be returned to the Ministry. The Ministry should, however, be informed of their disposal.15., If an appellant dies at any time between the lodging of his appeal and the receipt of the final decision, the fact should be reported to the Ministry together with the name and address of the widow or dependant, if any, and the report should be accompanied by a copy of the death certificate. This will enable immediate consideration to be given to the widow&apos;s and depen-danfs claim to pension, but the collection of evidence and preparation of report on the appeal should be completed as far as possible with a view to an ultimate decision as to any sum due to the man&apos;s estate for the period before his death.Form of Postcard to be used by Local Committees in making Application for Documents.Priority.Man&apos;s Name ........................

Should it be necessary for the men to come from some distance to appear before the Sub-Committee, they may be granted the co-.t of con-veyance from and to their homes, together with the following allowances :-(a) For every night spent in travelling to or from, or detention at, theplace where the Sub-Committee sits-3s. 6d.(b) For a return journey completed in one day, and in excess of 10 milesfrom the man&apos;s lime Is. 17. In addition to the above, compensation for loss of remunerative time may be made at rates not exceeding Is. an hour, subject to a maximum of 10s. a day, in cases in which the appeal is ultimately allowed by the Tribunal. No payment on this account should be made until the success of the appeal is notiiied by tho Mini-try nor should any payment on this account be included in the Local Comuiittee&apos;s accounts without being supported by a statement from the man&apos;s employer as to the time and wages lost. (A separate circular is in preparation dealing with men who are the sole owners of businesses or who are in casual employment.)V.-Recoverable Advances pendino Decisions.18. In cases in which the Medical Referee is ol opinion that the appeal should succeed advances may be made up to the prohable rate of pension appropriate to the degree of disablement assessed by the Medical Referee, on the understanding that, if the appeal is ultimately successful, they will be recovered by easy instalments from any award which may become payable. . If and so long as the man is in receipt of a temporary allowance under Article 7 (1) of the Royal Warrant, 1918, the advance should not exceed the difference between the weekly allowance and the presumptive rate of pension.19. If the Medical Referee further certifies that the man is unable to work, the amount of the advance (including for this purpose tempoiary allowance, if any) may be raised, until the appeal has been decided, to the equivalent of the full allowance that could be given under Article 6 (1) (a) of the Royal Warrant if tho man&apos;s claim were admitted.20. Any advances authorised hereunder should be at once discontinued on eceiptof a notific itiou from the Tribunal-(a) that the appeal has been disallowed; or(b) that the man has failed to attend when summoned to appear beforethe Tribunal, unless the Local Committee knows that this was due to illness.21. If in any case under para. 20 (b) the man satisfies the Local Committee that his failure to attend was due to some good and sufficient reason, the Tribunal should be informed, a medical certilcate being furnished in cases of illness. If satisfied with the explanation the Tribunal will give another date on which to hear the appeal, and will notify the Local Committee, whereupon the advance may be resumed. If not satisfied with the explanation the Tribunal will notify the Local Committee to that effect and no further advances should then be made.* If similar evidence has already been furnished to the Ministry in connection with an application under Article 9 of the Royal Warrant (see Circulars 143 and 178), it need not be repeated, nor need the Committee obtain a fresh Certificate from tho Medical Referee. It will be sufficient if the Committee, in forwarding the Appeal Form to the Ministry, state that certificates have already been supplied under the above-mentioned circulars, giving the reference number if known and adding any information subsequently acquired by them and consid red to be of value in connection with the appeal.t Note.-If no disability is considered attributable or aggravated the words f to t should be deleted.jane 3rd, 1919. circular 180.-alternative pensions.Amendment of Article 24 (6) or the Royal Warrant and Order hi Council,An amendment of Article 24 (6) of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council has been sanctioned, and the following should be substituted for the first paragraph of that Article :-&quot;&apos; Pre-War earnings&apos; means, in the case of a man who was in employment under a contract of service, tho averago weekly earnings during the twelve months immediately preceding the outbreak of war, Average weekly earnings shall be computed generally in accordance with tho provisions of tho Work-men&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906 : provided that where, in the course of such twelve mouths-, there was a change in the man&apos;s rate of remuneration, and such change was not of a temporary but of a reasonably permanent nature, then the average weekly earnings shall bo calculated on the man&apos;s earnings during tho period since such change in his remuneration or since tho last of such changes if there were more than one, In the case of a man in a trade, bttsin ss orpr Session, the average profits of the last three years preceding the commencement of the war shall bo taken, or of such lesser period as ho engaged therein,&quot;This alteration necessitates an amendment to paragraph 5 (d) of Schedule I. (a) to the Instructions for the Assessment of Alternative Pensions, which should therefore read :-&quot; Where the man has been remunerated at different rates in the course of tho twelvo months, the earnings should be averaged. But if in any cas-i it is clear that the rate of remuneration in the latter period of employment represented a reasonably permanent rise or fall in the man&apos;s wages, and not merely a temporary or casual variation, then the earnings during such latter &apos; period only shall be taken in computing the average weekly earnings.&quot;.These amendments take effect as from the 7lh March last, and apply only to cases in which tho application for alternative pension is made on or after that date. Their effect , where there was a change in the rate of remuneration during the year preceding the outbreak of war, is to secure the assessment of the pre-war earnings on the basis of the last rate in payment during tlu* year, provided that the change was of a reasonably permanent nature. Tine principle will apply whether the change represented an increase or decrease in the mau&apos;s rate of remuneration. It will seldom happen that there will have bean a permanent decrease in earnings, but the same rule will be applied in all cases, as it is the permanent rate of pay at tho outbreak of war which should be the determining factor in assessing Alternative Pensions.june 6th, 1919; circular 181.-part ii. regulations. wiyes and dependants of voluntarily enlisted and re-enlisted men.The question of the application of the Special Grants Committee^ Regula. tions, Part II., to wives, children and dependants of men remaining in and enlisting or re-enlisting in the Forces, has been under consideration, and the following decisions have been arrived at as regards men serving in the Army and Air Force :-1. (a) Men retained under the Military Service Acts,(b) Mon re-engaging or re-enlisting without a break in their service The wives, children and dependants of men in categories 1 (a) and 1 (6) whose service is continuous will be entitled to continue to receive the full benefits of the Regulations so long as the Regulations remain operative.2.  Men enlisting without previous service or men re-enlisting after demobilisation or discharge. The wives, children and dependants of these men will not be eligible any advances, grants or allowances unde- the Special Giants Committees Regulations, Part II., and payments, if any, now in issue, must cease.It will be the duty of the Local Committee to review on the above basis all the grants now in issue, and to secure from the Regimental Paymaster con-cerned in the case of any grant applied tor since the date of the Armistice (November 11, 191S) and in any other case in regard to which the C immittee may feel doubt, the necessary information to enable the application to be dealt with in accordance with this decision.june 10th, 1919. circular 182. - provisional artificial limbs.Arrangements have been made with the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John of Jerusalem whereby, in order to obviate the use of crutches, peg legs of fibre or other prescribed pattern may be supplied at various centres to men who have suffered amputation of the lower limb.These may be supplied (1) to men on furlough before they are fitted with thiir artificial limbs, and (2) to pensioners after they have been fitted, in the following circumstances :-(1) Pationts awaiting admission to Fitting Hospitals are generally supplied by the War Office before they leave their Preparatory Hospital with a plaster pylon. While the man is on furlough he may, if he so desires, have the-plaster pylon supplemented by one of the provisional peg legs above referred to. The supply of such provisional peg leg will not delay admission to the Fitting Hospital for the supply of a permanent limb.. (2) The pensioner may, after he has been fitted with his permanent limb, be given one of these provisional peg legs to insure that, if for any reason he is prevented for a time from using his permanent limb, he may have means of gettin; about other than a return to the uss of crutches.In the event of a Committee receiving a request for such a provisional limb (either from a pensioner or from a man on furlough) application should be made to the Secretary, Provisional Limb Department, British Red Cross Society and Order of St, John of Jerusalem, 83, Pall Mall, S.W. 1, who will, in communication with the Committee, take all necessary steps for the supply. Forms of application for the purpose can be obtained from that address, (In Scotland the Secretary, Scottish Branch, British Red Cross Society, SO, St. Vincent Street, Glasgow, should be addressed, and in Ireland (o) Sir Robert Kennedy, K.C.M.G,, 23, Scottish Temperance Buildings, Donegal Square, Be&apos;fast, for Ulster, or (b) the Joint War Committee for Leinster, Minister and Connaught, at 40, Merrion Square, Dublin.)All payments for limbs supplied in the above manner either (1) to men on furlough or(2) to pensioners, will be made direct by the Ministry of Pensions to the Provisional Limbs Department, and it will not be necessity for Locai Committees to incur any expenditure in this connection beyond providing for the man&apos;s journeys to the Depots where the limbs are supplied and t\9) usua&quot; allowances when payable; but when the limb has not p eviously been in-. inspected by a surgeon the Committee should instruct their Medical Referee to examine the provisional limb supplied, and if it is satisfactory to sign the Red Cross P.L.D. Form 3. For this service a fee of 5s. may be paid to the, Medical Referee.It is desirable&apos;that pensioners should be encouraged to take advantage of this concession, and it is suggested that Committees should arrange,for the prominent display of one or more of the available posters calling attention to the facilities offered.
Questions and. Answers.Q. 255. A Sergeant in the Territorial Yeomanry held that rank prior to mobilisation and up to December, 1916. He was then appointed Acting Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant, and paid for that rank accordingly. The appoint-ment was made in Salonica, and held by him for two years. On December 18th, 1918, he went into hospital suffering from pneumonia, from which he died on December 26th, 1918. His widow has since received an advice that he reverted to the rank of Sergeant on December 18th. This would appear to be rather an unusual case, and is making a difference of 7s. a week in the separation allowance, and will naturally pre-judice her position as regards pension. Is not this man in exactly the same position as if he died on the field from wounds ?A. It has been ascertained from the War Office that the N.G.O.&apos;s reversion to his substantive rank of Sergeant on his admission to hospital was in accordance with the Begu-lations, which provide that paid acting rank will lapse as soon as the holder ceases to perform the duties of such rank, except that a soldier admitted to hospital will revert to his permanent rank only after the expiration of seven days from date of admission.Q. 256. I was discharged as medically unfit on December 4, 1918, and was awarded a disablement pension of 20 per cent, for 52 weeks. I had at the date of discharge fourteen years 105 days&apos; service in the R.G.A., nearly three years at the rank of Sergeant. (1) What rate of service pension am I entitled to ? (2) Is it payable from date of disable-ment penson, and (3) Does the rate of disablement pension affect the rate of service pension ? I have been under-going treatment at Lancaster Gate and have been in receipt of treatment allowance, so service pension has not been assessed.A.-As you have less than eighteen years&apos; service you can receive a service pension only if you are in receipt of a permanent disablement pension on the lohest scale under the Royal Warrant of April 11th, 1918, or if the nature of your injuries entitles you under that Warrant to a permanent pension the rate of which has not been finally assessed. As you are at present only in receipt of a con-ditional pension you cannot yet be granted a service pen-sion in addition. Should you subsequently be granted a permanent pension under the Boyal Warrant o/1918, any service pension to which you might be entitled would be awarded, from the date of discharge, but in that event your disablement pension would be reduced to the rate for a private, also with effect from date of discharge. Your eligibility for service pension and the rate thereof if eligible will be decided by the Commissioners of the Boyal Hospital, Chelsea, who deal with claims to service pension.Q. 257. Am I entitled to treatment allowances from the Local War Pensions Committee under the following circum-stances?  I am a Civil servant receiving full salary whilstat present ill, with ninety-six days&apos; war service. Have a temporary pension on basis of 30 per cent, for self and one child, because I was discharged unfit owing to neurasthenia. I am not entitled to panel doctor, am exempt from pro-visions of National Health Insurance Act, and the Local Medical Referee has certified me unfit for work for thirteen weeks.A. As a Civil servant you are not entitled to receive allowances under Article 6 (1) (a) of the Boyal Warrant if your civil sick-pay plus your pension are equal to or exceed the amount payable to you under that Article. Other-wise by arrangement with your Department you may receive treatment alloivances in lieu of pension and civil sick-pay. As you are not eligible for medical benefit under the National Insurance [Health) Acts, your Local War Pen-sioas Committee will arrange for you to be provided, free of cost to yourself, with treatment by a general practitioner, if this form of treatment is certified by the Medical Beferee to be necessary and adequate.Q. 258.--IS it correct that a widow may draw full pension and also separation allowance on a son ? I under-stand there is an Army Order No. 1082.A. A soldier&apos;s wife or dependant may receive separation allowance at the full rate without deduction on account of any pension received in respect of a deceased soldier, sailor or airman. Payments of separation alloivance which were being made at a reduced rate were increased to the full rate with effect from September 17th, 1918.Q. 259. In the event of the death of a discharged dis-abled man whose death is certified to be aggravated by military service, can the dependants of the man claim the grant oi  7 10s. as mentioned in Circular 171 ?A.  The dependants of a discharged disabled man can-not claim a grant for funeral expenses. Instruction 42 relating to the treatment and training of disabled men (1917) provides as folloivs ; In the event of a disabled man dying in an Institution to which he had been admitted as an in-patient under arrangements made by the Local Committee, the Committee may pay the expenses of his burial within the sum of  4. This amount has now been extended, with the sanction of the Treasury, to  7 10s. Local Committees are also empowered to make a grant in cases of men dying at home as a result of a disability attributable to or aggravated by Naval or Military service. In such a case the grant must not exceed  7 10s., or the actual amount of the funeral expenses, whichever the less, and the grant must only be made (1) where the cause of death was a disability attributable to or aggravated by the maris service; and (2) where the Admiralty, War Office, or Air Ministry have not accepted responsibility for the provision of a service funeral.london published BY- HIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OFFICE.
