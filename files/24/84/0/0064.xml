(THIS DOCUMENT IS tk6  KOPBBSY OP HIS 3RIT&apos;UfflIC MAJESTY1S OOVKHMENT)- &quot;.vith reference to the. Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for V?ur (G.T.7595) I desire to draw tho attention1   of the Cabinet to the Report of the Select Committee on national Expenditure, Wth Report (92 of 1918) Paras.10 and 11, dealing with these Canteen ?unds.The Select Committee wrote as follows:-&apos;&quot;10*    The Navy and Army Canteerg Board conducts Army Canteens on behalf of the Army Council.   It is a trading organisation with.a gross annual turn-over of some  20,000,000.     it is financed by.a Treasury guarantee of  3,000,000, by.t the Board OocupieB a quasi-independent position;   its accounts are audited by its own auditors, and not by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.     Its receipts are derived, first, from the expenditure in canteens of the cash allowance granted to troops for messingover and above the ration rissued in kind;   secondly, from the soldiers&apos; individual expenditure in canteens. Ten A;er cent of these receipts is given up by the Board, four-fifths of the 10 per cent to the units, one-fifth to the Central Regimental Institutes Fund. The question whether the profits derived from the expenditure of the 6^d. cash allowance belong to the public purse or not was re-opened after only  40,000. had been paid in respect of one quarter, and has not yet been decided.   This is a matter proper for the consideration of the Public Accounts Committee, and pending their report upon it we have suspended our enquiry into the operations of the Board.1&apos;&quot;11.    A second question that arises in this connection relates to the Central Regimental Institutes Fund., It is a trust fund, vested in the Army Council, to be used for the benefit of the soldier.    At the end of the war it is likely to iimount to several millions. *     Me^atime, however, it forms part of the working capital of the Navy and Army Canteens Board.    The situation with respeot to this fund needs further investigation on the part both of the r/ar Office and of the Treasury. Among other considerations that should be borne in mind is the fact that before the war we had a small pro-feeeional Army;   after the war our forces will be^      reduced to whatever peace establishment it may be found neoeesary to maintain;   during tho yer.,rs of war the Army has been expanded to include a great part of theI        adult manhood of the nation.     It is from this vastlySECRET.VJAH CA3HB.T.DISPOSAL 0-&apos; CANTKEN PROFITS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
larger body that this fund has been drawn, and tho disposal of it should take these differences into acoount.    We consider that, in my orent, the House of Commons should have cognisance of the grants made from time to time from the Central Regimental Jjostitirtes--Fund, and of ^ny proposals of dealing w:.th the - aooumulcitod balance &quot;at the erd of the war.&quot;I do not support the suggested claim of the PublicPurse to. any ,share&apos;, of the: profits of the canteens; but,(1) tho ol-aim of the ox-soldier to share, (2) the claim of the House of Commons to bo consulted, and (3) repro-sentation of the pensions Ministry on the Central Council;all these require consideration and arc not mentioned,I. believe, in the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor wiri.(Initialled)   A,C.Treasury, 22nd. July, 1919.
