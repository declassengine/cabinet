During the week 73 acres of land at iiinson, Dorset, have been mrchased from Lord 7imborne for the sum of  5,000.    This land adjoins the Red Triangle Jtoria belonging to the Y.M.C.A. which.is being devoted to the training of disabled ex^Sorv^eg men.    Vacant possession will be obtained at liichaelmaa noxt*   this purchaso brings tho total area of land administered by the Board up to 18,621 aores^Two additional ex-Sorvice men commenoed r/oigt f$ the Farm settlements during the week, making the total number of suoh $nen now X&apos;mx)ioyod 213.    This number consists of 69 settlers,  14 probationers and 40 other ex-Service men employed as wage-earners.    In addition 15 men have boon acocpted as probationers, but have not yet commenced work.5.
Treasury aanct ion having now &quot;been obtained and a selection made from a very large number of applicants, the appointment of Directors for the Settlements at Amesbury and Bosbury is being proceeded with.    Assistant Directors for the larger Settlements such as Patrington and Amesbury are also being appointed. , -.-,The Board have now received from the Y.M,C.A, a list of huts they have for sale which may be suitable for re-erection as Club Rooms at the Board&apos;s Farm Settlements.    The huts are being inspected at once with a viow to an offer being made for any found to be suitable.the reports received from the Directors show that at Patringtgn all crops have considerably improved during the week. Exhibits have been sent from the Settlement to the Withernsea and South Holderness Agricultural Show and two prizes wcro secured in the &quot;Horses&quot; classes.At Holbeach the hay harvest is now finished, and the   r greater part of the crop has been obtained in excellent condition Many of the settlers are now planting cauliflowers on the land from which potatoes have recently been cleared.    All crops have improved considerably since the rain.     Pour probationers commenced work at this Settlement during the week.The hay harvest at Heath Kill has now been completed. A pure-bred dairy Shorthorn bull&quot;has boon purchased for this Settlement.The stock at Pejmbrjsy, are doing well, and the crops show considerable improvement.   &quot;&quot;A bull has been purchased for this Settlement also.At i^Jjburv. but few showers have fallen and rain is badly wanted for*the&quot;potatoes and roots. All stock and corn crops are looking well and tho winter oats are nearlyready for harvesting,     Kay making has now finished.The principal work during the past week at Rolleston ., has been in the hay   fields.     Steam cultivators are busy cultivating the fallows.     The corn crops continue to improve, but the roots are not grov/ing very fast.     The quality of the hay will bo very much better and the crop will be heavier than was at one time anticipated.    A good deal of hay still remains to be cut at this Settlements    Two South Down rams have been purchased and sent to this Settlement during the week.At Bosbury the hay , , harvest has now been completed. On the whole the hay is a very poor crop.    The roots are a   , failure and have had to be re-sown.
(&apos;d.JL-) Work of Agricultural flxocutivc Committees.In November 1917 the l icesj;jrz&amp;tiVS. took over afarm of about 1.30 acres which was &quot;occupied by a very unsatisfactory tenant and was in an excessively bad state of cultivation.    The arable land, comprising 49 acres, was in such a very foul condition, and so badly farmed, that with the exception of one field it was necessary to dead fallow it in 1918.     The Committee have now withdrawn from possession, and handed the farm back to tho owner, who has paid the sum of  600 representing the value to him of tho Committee&apos;s improvements.     Including this item, tho total receipts during thft period of occupation amounted to  1,085 and the payments to  1,026, leaving a balance of  59 without, however, allowing anything for the Committal5s administrative - expenses.ML^. I3$^^ The Board1 s attention hasbeen called&quot;&apos;To&quot;&apos;The&quot;fac&apos;t* thaT^the Sussex County Aerial Club have purchased New Salts Harm, Lancing, and 40 acres of tho neighbouring Old Salts Farm, with the intention of laying down to grass the whole of the arable land on the former farm and 16 acres.of the latter for the -purpose of a Hying Station, and Tennis, Polo and Golf Ground8     The occupier of Old Salts Farm has benn served by the West Sussex Agricultural Executive Committee with a Cultivation Order, which includes the fallowing of the 16 acres which the Aerial Club propose to lay down to grass.     The West Sussex Committee state that thiB is only one instance in a series of similar cases, in which Aerodromes are being established round tho coast.The ^astrRidi^.pf Yorkshire A.13.6. have asked for the Board&apos;s permission to&apos;.enter, upon and&quot; take possession of certain fields on Owbrcugh House Farm, near Skirlaugh.     The farm is in poor condition, and the arable land is foul with weeds.     The occupier died last year, and the farm is being carried on at present by his widow, assisted by her two sons, one of w$Lom has just returned from the Army.     The hedges and dykes are in a bad condition, and the farm generally has deteriorated since March 1917.    The Board have authorised the Committee to take possession of the land, together with the buildings, and to arrange for its cultivation, !&apos; *     &apos;&apos;.**r. by the incoming tenant as Agent of the Executive Committee, but at his own expense.4a.
(iii) Provision of Allotments.The Council of Dudley County Borough entered under the Cultivation of Lands Order on a total area of some 75 acres of land in the Borough on which they provided 1050 allotments.,     In addition some 25 acres of land owned by the Borough was put under cultivation thus providing 400 further plots.The Local Authority have carried out negotiations as tc continued occupation under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land ) Act, 1916, for a period of at least two years from the termination of the war 0f the 75 acres entered under the Cultivation of Lands Order and, in every case, the owners are willing that the existing arrangements shall continue.The Council also propose that the allotments on their own land shall continue at all events for the present.    The tenants are paying economic rents.(iv)   Land Drainage.Bast Riding.     A system of drains near Howden, on the North bank of&quot;The&quot;ouse estuary is being cleared by the Agricultural Executive Committee;   among these the Town Culvert or Howden Dyke has been cleaned, but owing to the .        irregular grading of the^ culvert and the action of the Sanitary Authority in letting in    &quot;&apos; tide water with the idea of flushing the culvert, it is feared that the effect of the work may not be permanent *    Another difficulty arises from the custom of letting in the tide in dry seasons to fill ponds and watering places connected with the dyke.West Riding.    Accounts have been furnished relating to drainage work at &apos;Tickhill (clearing of parish drains) which was completed by the itocutive Committee at a cost of  400 in April 1918,     The whole of this money has been collected, a fact which affords testimony to the good results obtained in improving an area of about 5,000 acres.A petition has been received for the constitution of a drainage district for an area bounded by the River Aire, the River Ouse and the Selby Canal,Lancashire,     An Order transferring to the County Council the powers of the Alt Commissioners, Croston Commissioners, Overt on Commissi o,ners, and Slyne Valley Commissioners has been drafted on the petition of the County Council, and is being deposited this week.The iSxecutive Committee have for more than a year past been exercising the powers of the Croston Commissioners under Regulation 2M, and as it is desirable to continue the work under permanent statute, the Drainage Committee set up under the Act of 1918 have now given 30 days&apos; notice to tho Commissioners of their intention to take over the exercise cf those powers under Section 15 (2) of the Act of 1918.Ncrf0.11c,   Notices under Section 15 (l) of the Land Drainage Act, 19107 have been served by the Drainage Committee on a number of landowners for the enforcement of their liabilities to repair tho banks of the v/iasey.     This is the first case in which aotion has been taken under that subsection.
Surrey,   A draft order constituting a separate drainage diet riot&quot;&quot;? or the River Hole haB teen deposited;   few objeotioha have been received and those have mostly been disposed of.    An objection lodged by the Thames Conservators with a view to control by them of any works to be carried out by the proposed Drainage Board is still pending;   tiut it is hoped that this matter may be settled by oral discussion;   and when this has been effected, the Order can be made,(v) Tithe, Copyhold, Commons and Survey.During the past week the tithe rentcharge included in the applications received for redemption amounted to  1,034, which is nearly as much as the total for the whole of last year and practically one half of the average yearly amount for the ten years prior to the War,     The numbers of applications for altered apportionment, merger, and enfranch:sequent are also well above the normals     The rapid increase in the work is necessitating additions from time to time in the staff and the necessity for increased accommodation is becoming uigentcThe Board havo bep,n in communication with the Office of Woods respecting the unsatisfactory condition of Walsworth Common (Hertfordshire) tho soil of which is ve&amp;ttd in tho Crown,    Owing to unsatisfactory drainage, the common,- which at one time was valuable grazing 2and is now practical3y a marsh.     The Office of Woods have pointed out that there is no legal liability on the Crown (whose interest is little more than nominal) to take steps to prevent flooding of the common.     In the circumstances the best method of improving the common is to &quot;bring it under regulation under the Commons Act, 1699.     Steps are being taken for this purpose; but the matter has been deDayed somewhat pending the alteration of the boundary between the Kitchin Urban District Council and the Hitchin Rural District Council so as to bring the Parish of Walsworth within the Urban District,The Branch have suggested to the Board that, in the interests of food production and re-afforestation, it is desirable that the Board should consider whether 5.t would be practicable to &quot;;revive next Session the Real Property&apos;and Conveyancing Bill of 1914, so far as regarcia the provisions for general enfranchisement of copyhold and customary land that it contained.Commercial Division.l9.1^rP5l?i1$^-L.^^lJ--J^MAilg *   Considerable progress has been made with 1&apos;he&quot;appoint:ment ^&quot;Architects. 30 Counties having now accepted the Board&apos;s recommendation for the appointment of special Architectural Officers^     In 23 Counties the appointments have actually been approved by the Board, while in the remaining 15 it is probable that the appointments will be settled at an early date,Eighteen Counties have put forward plans for the equipment of new holdings or for the adaptation and repair of existing
buildings for new holdings, and in regard to thirteen of these the drawings have heen provisionally approved with a view to tenders being obtained.Potash.    Progress is now being made with the arrangements for the distribution cf the potash imported from Germany in exchange for food.     One of the difficulties in disposing of this product has been the fact that the Alsatian Government have been pressing for permission to import large quantities of potash and have also been booking orders and appointing Agents in all parts of the country.     As a result of consultation with the Alsatian representatives, a proposal is now being considered whereby about 30,000 tons of Government owned potash would be sold to the Agents of the Alsatian Mines at approximately the cost price to the Government, subject to an agreement as to the maximum price at which, it should be sold for consumption in this country.    The balance would be offered to Compound Fertiliser Makers for use in the manufacture of compound manures.     In consideration of the Alsatian Agents purchasing this large block of Government potash, they would be allowed to import, if they so desire, an equivalent quantity of Kainit (14$ KgOj for sale by them in this country at an agreed price     The result of this arrangement would be that the British farmer would have an opportunity of obtaining potash of all grades at a reasonable price and that there would be an ample supply;   at the same time the arrangement is one which it is believed would give great satisfaction to the French Government, as it would in effect place the great bulk of the potash trade in the hands of the Agents of the Alsatian Mines, and thus enable them to establish themselves in the market;     moreover this Board would be relieved of what promised to be a very troublesome responsibility of disposing of the German potash without financial loss and without giving offence to the French Government by appearing to sell an enemy product in preference to the produce of one of our Allies,Binder Twine,  , The information available as to sales of binder twine during the present season shows that about 9,500 tons were delivered up to the end of June, and that makers, have in hand awaiting delivery 3,900 tons, while in addition the stock held by the Board amounted to nearly 400 tons.    The demand at the present time is very small, hardly any sales taking place, and it seems evident that the prospects of a light crop have led farmers to reduce their purchases to the lowest possible figure, while In addition it is probable that considerable quantities were left in farmers&apos; hands last year.     It may safely be stated that all agricultural requirements will be fully supplied.Nicotine .t    The output of British-made nicotine during the twelve months ending 30th June, exceeded 35.000 lbs, as against 32,500 lbs, in the preceding season.     In addition about 15,000 -20,000 lbs, have been imported from America, whereas the imports last year were quite small.    Notwithstanding this the demand U     is in excess of the supply.
Export of Seed Grain.    The reduction whioh is to take place in the price of imported wheat will probably result in the prioe of ? home grown wheat of the new orop being considerably below the price ruling in any other European country, and in consequence an attempt is bound to be made to export grain, whether for seed or miHing,; to the Continent.    The Wheat. Commission has also drawn the attention of the Board to the unreasonably large profits which would arise from this trade if it were allowed, and the question of how it can be prevented, while maintaining to a reasonable extent the regular export trade in seed grain from this oountry, is under consideration.Technical and Cultivation Division.Education Branch.Reoonstmotion Proposals.(1)   Higher, Bduoat ion and Research.    Nearly all       i Institutions have now submitted proposals for the extension their education work during the next five years.    The proposals are under consideration.    Similar schemes regarding the Research Institutes will be considered at a meeting to be held during the   . next few days* and it is hoped that a definito decision will then % be come to as regards this branch of the work.f11)   County Education.     In response to the Board&apos;8 circular letter of the 8th January last inviting the submission of comprehensive schemes of Agricultural Education, the great majority of Local Authorities have intimated that the matter is reoeiving full consideration.    Detailed schemes have been received from Berkshire, Kent, jSesex, Middlesex and Somerset, while fifteen ether Counties have consultod the Board with regard to the formulation *)f their proposals.     The question of the establishment of a Parm institute is receiving attention in many Counties.     In several cases preparation of a scheme is delayed pending the reorganisation of the Committee in charge of Agricultural Education or the appointment of an Agricultural Organiser,Special Research.    A meeting of the Advisory Committee in Agricultural Science was held on the 15th inst., at which applications were considered for grants for the purpose of carrying out special pieces of research at various institutions. The Committee also considered applications for the special Research iiixhibitions of  200 for one year recently approved by the Treasury. It was decided to recommend three of the applicants for Exhibitions, making a total number of fifteen so far awarded.e.

A visit has also been paid to the Surrey Education Offioe and the question of introducing a school into tho County was discussed with the Officials.The clerk to tho Borough of Wandsworth having represented to the Ba^rd that the milk sent to London by tho West Surrey and Hants Dairy Farmers1 Association was not arriving in A satisfactory condition the Branch arranged for an Inspector to pay a visit to tho factory and to report.    This fteport was entirely satisfactory and showed fairly conclusively that co-operation under theee circumstances was resulting in the saving of transport And in the general betterment     the milk supply.Archie Dairy. $arming Demonetration.   Further inspections have been made of possible sites in^Cornwall, Somerset, Wilts., Hereford, South Wales and Stafford, and a visit of enquiry has been paid to Durham.

Bn Cornwall a vary suitable site has been found pnd arrangements have been almost completed.laptose factory.      The demonstration factory at Haslington isin oourcte of erection.Dried whev.    A considerable demand has recently arisen for dri$4 whey.    3n view of the fret that a great waste of whey oontinues at bgvotsI cheese factories, the Branch hAS recently been carrying cut a practical enquiry as to the oammercial possibilities of drying whey cvav the ordinary milk drying rolls.    For this purpose an arrangement was made to take over temporarily an experimental plant situated a* Basford, Notts, whioh had previously been used by the Ministry of Food,    A satisfactory product has now been obtained at a working cost of approximately 3d. jer lb.    The purchasers are at present offering 7d. per lb.    As it seemed important that the position should be made known as quiojjtly as possible, the Branch has arranged to hold a demonstration at BasSord en Thursday next, to which a representative from each cheese Sactory has been invited.Ce-operation in Agriculture.    The development of co-operationthrough the medium of tne co-operative cheese schools led to the Board conferring with the Agricultural Organisation Society concerning the desirability of co-ordination of effort between County Agricultural Education Officials and the officials of the Ae0.S. As a result it was arranged that the Board should take stops to organise local conferences.     One cf these Conferences was held at Tvuro on 15th July when there wore present the Chairman of the Dairy Education Committee for Cornwall, the chief Education officials for the county and representative officials of the A.O.S. The meeting was quite successful and a resolution was passed thanking the Board for having convened the Conference and asking tiwt a further Sonferenoe should bo arranged early in next year.jJicfltionB Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets dealt with was 500 in response to whioh 2,535 copies woro despatched.2n addition 5,250 copies of leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.

The board&apos;s officers are working in close connection with experimenters of the Armstrong College, Newcastle, and it is hoped that much useful information will be obtained from the experiments which are to be carried out.*women^s Branch.The demand for women labour this week is in excess of the supply, and a small number of women are being enrolled for the flax and potato harvests in Yorkshire,     It is difficult to say what the state of employment will be in the near future as the increased hourly rates laid down by the Wages Board came into operation on July 14th.     Some employers may not be willing to pay the higher wage, but if the women are returned to Depot it is anticipated that there will be no difficulty in absorbing them into other vacancies, the demand for skilled milkers still being very great.Accommodation for women who are to work in a PI ax Camp in Yorkshire has been inspected and passed in all cases but one, where the women would have had to live under canvas.    This has not been found satisfactory in the past, and it has been decided that where women are required in large numbers they shall not be billeted except in cottages or barns which have been passed as suitable.Scholarships at Agricultural Colleges have been offered by the Worcester County Council to members of the Land Army, and up to the present 3 girls have gone to the Midland Agricultural Dairy College for a special 6 weeks course     Similar scholarships have been offered by the Staffordshire County Counoil, two of which have been obtained by women of the Land Army who have commenced their course at the same college,&apos;Woraen; s Institutes.

Of Olandorq and Sheen-Scab there has been one case each,There has only bern 1 outbreak of Rabjos confirmed, namely, in Monmouthshire.    Owing to this case and an earlier one it was considered desirable to impose special restrictions over a small area in the vicinity of the outbreaks.    There have been 16 reports of suspected oases.    The work in connection with the Control Orders is very heavy, partly due to the holiday season, and partly to the modification of the conditions on which dogs may be moved out of certain parts of the control districts.Rats Orders. J.916-^919,Prints of the draft Rats and Hice (Destruction) Bill have been received.    Copies of this were sent on the 17th inst. to the Scottish Office, the Irish Office, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Food, inviting the observations of these Departments at an early date    Their replies have not yet been received.Lord Aberconway&apos;s Rat Destruction Bill 1b down for Second Reading in the House of Lords on the 24th inst.The Food Consumers1 Council at their Meeting on the 16th inst., after considerable discussion on the subject of the damage being done by rats throughout the country, passed the following Resolution:-&quot;The Consumers&apos; Council Btrongly urge upon the Government tho necessity of dealing with the terrible depredations of rats on a National scale : , with the greatest possible promptitude, as it is estimated that the loss by rats at the present time amounts to not less than  15,000,000 sterling annually, or ojS per year of  300,000,000, or more than the total value of the fish landed in twelve months at our ports.&quot;Veterinary Departmsnt,Swinerfever material was examined in 94 reported outbreaks.

A letter has been written to the Development Cor.mi5s.&quot;.on or&amp; containing the Bos7d&apos;.e considered recommendation as regards the course to be pursued with regard to the construction of research vessels.     This recommendation is that it would be costly and impracticable to adopt Lord Jersey trawlers now being completed for the Admiralty, and that it would be better to start Jib ilJitio at liessrs.

There has been great delay in getting engines and other materials- presumably on account of the disturbed state of labour.      Two installations have been completed recently, but the Commit tee,1c reduced staff of mechanics havo bo?n engaged chiefly on repair work.     Tho delivery of engines has now been commenced again, and. owing to the disorganisation of their arrangements, the Committee will probably have a difficulty in dealing with all the installations that will be needing attention at the sametimeGeneral Division.Flax Pro duct ion Branch,The harvest is now in full swing in the Somerset and peter- &apos; borough CentreSc    Good progress has been made in Sox&amp;ereet end Dorset but labour is scarce in the latter county.A number of women.who assisted in harvest operations last year, when the Branch undertook the harvest, have volunteered to assist growers thus year and these are being accommodated in small camps on the growers1 premises.Harvest will commence next week in the Selby Centre and inSuffolk.In Yorkshire the orop is. well up to the average, but in some areas in Suffolk the seed failed to germinate, and crop3 in this Centre are generally poor.H Excellent reports have been received as to the crop inFife shire.Scutching is now in progress at Taunton in addition to factories previously mentioned.
