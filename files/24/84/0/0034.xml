&apos;G-L 7734 Hiffioj*2to.j.^I   was instructed^ on the 29th May to investigate the reasons for the shortage in the supply of Vvhlsky, particularly having regard to the sitholding of supplies by traders and the sale of Whisky secretly at prices above the controlled price&apos;.     I desire to report the result of ray investigations.  &apos;^,    Since the Statutory limitation on the delivery of spirits from bond fas first instituted ther^e has always been,a considerable scarcity of hisky.    The supplies were necessarily reduced, while the demand was actually increased owing to two causes; (l) tfHe. ihcreased spending power of a considerable section of the population and (2) The reduced quantity and unattractive quality of beer.    The latter cause has now been in great part removed and there has lately been noticed less inclination to purchase drink irrespective of price.3.    As a result of the increase in the duty placed on Spirits by the Chancellor of the Exchequer this general scarcity was aggravated by a dislocation in the Trade as regards distribution, owing to uncertainty as to the proportion of the duty which the various sections had to arrange to bear without passing any portion of the duty on to the consumer.4.    My Technical Adviser thereupon entered into negotiations with the various branches of the Spirits Trade and ultimately they agreed to an adjustment of inter-trade prioes which has now been embodied in a Statutory Order.     It was a term of this agreement that the holders of stocks should-, to the utmost possible capacity, furnish supplies of srhisky on a basis of -75$ per annum of that sold and cleared to customers for the same period      1916.    There is evidence that the arrangement has been loyally observed.5.     Complaint has been made that in certain cases Off-licence holders instead of selling &quot;Whisky in bottle to their customers have disposed of their supplies   at enhanced prices to licensed victuallers, who have re-sold this whisky in a public bar, thereby securing an increased profit, but it has been found difficult to secure definite information on this point, and it is not believed that the practice exists to any material extent.   -I have been asked in Parliament to consider what relief could be afforded for cases of undoubted hardship owing to the system of distribute ton on a datum  year basis.    This chiefly affected clubs which came Into existence after 1916 and officers and men who were in that year serving abroad.As regards clubs, arrangements have been made whereby application for supplies will be considered by the Board of Customs and Excise. In cases whore the Customs are satisfied that provision should be made special clearance certificates will be issued and such certificates lonoured.1The Advisory Committee to the Board of Customs and Excise are of opinion that wine merchants are dealing with demobilised officers as generously as possible.    In any case complaints of unfair treatment have tow become rare.V    I am satisfied that licensed premises and clubs are receiving and Jill continue to receive a reasonable amount of spirits.    The private individual, however, is bound to suffer so long as the present system of Restricted output is maintained.     It will, I think, be advisable to consider in the Autumn whether any and what modifications of tho present Restrictions of output are desirable.Ministry of pood.     ^ gsorgk h.
