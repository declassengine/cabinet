A J3 I O %t THE TlSMPOlURY O&amp;SOTAPH IN MgaMemorandum submitted by the first Commissioner of Works.To the War Cabinet *A great deal of publio interest is shown in the question as to whether the temporary cenotaph, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, should be replaced by a permanent structure, either on the present site, or at eomo other pi ace 9    A number of questions have already been addressed to me on the $ubjoot in the House, and the subject has aroused widespread interest in the Iress, whioh soems generally favourable to the idea of * making the memorial permanent.    Sir-Edwin lutyens himself has written to me on the subject, urging making the memorial a permanent one on the present site, and expressing his readiness to design one on the same lines, with more elaboration than time permitted with the present model.    The whole subject is one that is not free from difficulty.     In favour of retaining the memorial on the, present site are the following considerations:(Ij It will be the historic spot whero the Allied Troops saluted the Glorious Dead on leaco Day^ Ho other site will have the same historical and sentimental association,(2) The monument itself is dignified and simple and *he position is a central and fine one,(3) The public has become accustomed to seeing the Monument on the present site, and the present design has received a considerable amount of public approval,(4) The erection of a Kionumont on these linos in a permanent form will solve the difficult question of a War Memorial which is bound to become soon a subject of publio interest.On the other hand, the considerations against the present site and memorial aro as follows:-fl) It can be argued that tho position of such a Monument in the middle of such a busy thoroughfare is likely to obstruct traffic, which is already very congested,( ) The Monument, although appropriate for the occasion, may not be regarded as sufficiently important and may be of too mournful a character as a permanent expression of the triumphant victory of our arms.
(3) There will probably be a demand for a greater and more imposing Monument in any event.(4) On the present bite it may well become tho habit, as it is in other cases, for the public to&apos;surround tho Monument with flowers and wreatha.   This habit on tho present site would be difficult to control and might develop into an unseemly untidiness.(5) Tho ,;ite is on ground under the control of the Wcstoinstbr Borough Council.    Tha Council!s consent would have to bo obtained.Tho from-o sal to erect a replica of - the present dosign on   some othor site would seem to me scarcely worthy of consideration.    Tho-whole point would be lost and the Monument itself would lose its appropriateness, having been designed for a special position, and for a special occasion.The question I wish-the Cabinet to decide; is, whether they wish a permanent replica to be erected on the present site in-Whitehall to be proceeded with.   If so, I will oommunicate with bir Edwin Lutyens as to the cost of the alterations necessary to the design, etc., and submit the matter again to the Cabinet,(Intd,)H.M. Office of Works. 23rd July, 1919,
