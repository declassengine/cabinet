[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovemnifeaU Printed for the War Cabinet,    July 1919.THE following^BBSiaBlMrandum^hict I was instructed by the War Cabinet to prepare with regard to the political and social aspect of Bolshevik policy in Russia at the present moment.C. of K.I. Bolshevik Russia.Although the reports of recent developments inside Bolshevik Russia lack definite confirmation, for the reason that all official means of communication either directly or through neutral Powers are severed, indications are not lacking that the Russian Soviet Government have been, compelled by force of circumstances and experience to modify many of the theories for which they are generally understood to stand, and that they are now embarking on a policy more in accordance with the adopted principles of international comity and intercourse.&apos; The following examples may be given of the present trend of opinion in Russian Bolshevik governing circles: 1. Land and Peasantry.Notwithstanding their previous extreme attitude, the Soviet Government now permit the. peasants to hold land, and have declared that their policy is gradually and systematically to include the middle class peasantry in the work off socialistic reconstruction. As a safeguard they insist that the peasants must be separated from the well-to-do classes and drawn to the side of the working classes. Lenin himself is a supporter otf this departure, and has declared in a recent speech to the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party that&quot; we should especially emphasize our persevering attitude towards the middle class peasantry, and devise a whole series of increasingly concrete measures which would immediately give something to the middle class peasantry.&quot;&apos;2. The Bourgeoisie.The Bolshevik Government now admit the necessity of using the resources of bourgeois science and technical knowledge. As an example of their present attitude may be cited the fact that when the labour commune of agriculture ended in failure, the authorities decided to organize large agricultural undertakings, which were to be worked on capitalistic lines. Farmers with scientific knowledge were entrusted with full powers for obtaining labour and maintaining discipline. On this point also Lenin has declared that &quot; without the bourgeois specialist it is impossible to raise up the productive forces. ... They must be surrounded by an atmosphere of comradely co-operation .... to force a whole class to work by means ojf the strike is impossible . . . . We must draw them into our apparatus, and for this we must sometimes make sacrifices.&quot; - ,3, Attitude of; the Soviet Government to other Parties in Russia.Reports have been received that.the Soviet Government have entered into relations with the Menshevik and Social Revolutionary Parties, and have even concluded some kind of alliance with them,. The evidence is not conclusive, but merits attention notwithstanding.4. Concessions to. Foreign Capitalistic Organisations. .&apos;. Concessions have been offered by the Russian Soviet Government in various parts of Russia to capitalistic firms of non-Russian nationality in return for trade facilities. So far as our information goes, nothing has definitely resulted from these offers, but.the fact that they have been made shows that the Russian Soviet Government are prepared to abandon some of their previous theories in this direction also.,.. ,&apos;.&apos;/ ^y,;   %M * - -[293] SE...    -&quot;. ,:.B
5. Debts.; In practically all the recent negotiations which have been initiated with the Soviet Government, they have admitted that they are responsible for the financial obligations of the former Russian Empire and have agreed to meet their obligation.Writing to the &quot;Morning Post&quot; on the 14th July, M. Tchaikowsky furnishes confirmation of tjhe change of attitude on the part o&quot;f the Russian Soviet Government. He points to a series of concessions which have been made by Lenin on behalf of the Government he represents. According to him, bourgeois specialists have been placed at the head of many civil departments, and the German engineer, Krassin, formerly manager of the German firm of Siemen and Halske, of Moscow, on being offered the management of three Bolshevist Ministries, demanded as conditions of his acceptance of the post &apos;1. The appointment of German specialists, regardless of political opinions. ,2. The abolition of all committees of control o)f workmen and employees, and the appointment instead of responsible individual managers with practically unlimited powers.3. The introduction of piece work instead of time work, and overtime when necessary, regardless of the eight-hour day.These conditions are said to have been accepted by the Russian Soviet Government, and Mr. Krassin is now working at the head of a vast organisation of German technical experts. Indeed, all evidence points to a sustained German effort to organise Bolshevism on revised Teutonic lines.In connection with the trend of opinion among the leading luminaries of the Russian Soviet Government, it may be of interest to give a brief summary of the recent negotiations which have been entered into between the Allied and Associated Powers and the Russian Soviet Government.At the end of December 1918 a declaration was addressed to the Allied and Associated Governments through M. Litvinoff, to the effect that the Russian Soviet Government were prepared to enter into negotiations with the representatives of the Allied countries for the settlement of all outstanding questions. The terms proposed by the Soviet Government were roughly as follows: 1. No compensation or regulation off frontier. (Presumably this meant&apos; no compensation to Russians by the Soviet Government and no regulation of frontiers by the Allies.) Liberty of small States, such as Esthohia, to make their own arrangements.2. Bolsheviks to pay compensation for foreign property and securities in Russia u to such an extent as may be consistent with the Bolshevist Government^ principles.&quot;3. No reprisals on Russians who had joined the Allies. Such Russians would, however, be submitted to the same treatment as other bourgeois.4. Introduction of almost.universal suffrage and freedom of press by gradual stages till the Bolshevist Government becomes stable.5. Abstention by the Allies from interference with internal affairs of Russia,Before any reply had been made to this offer, the Allied and Associated Powers came forward in January. 1919 with a proposal that all the Russian groups should assemble at Prinkipo for the purpose of discussing their differences. The following were the conditions set out by the Allied Powers: (i.) The Allies recognised the absolute right of the Russian people to direct their own affairs without dictation or direction of any kind from outside.(ii.) They declared that it was not their wish or intention to assist any one of the organised groups contending for the leadership of Russia as against the others.(iii.). They accordingly invited representatives of every organised group exercising, or attempting to exercise, power in Russia, to send representatives to Prinkipo, provided that hostilities should in the meanwhile cease.The Soviet Government replied to the following effect:-   .(i.) They expressed their willingness to acknowledge the financial obligations of the old Russian Empire as regards creditors belonging to the Governments of the Entente, besides guaranteeing payment of interest on its debts by a certain quantity of raw material.
(ii.) They declared themselves prepared to place concessions cf mines, forests,&amp;c, at the disposal of the citizens of the Entente Governments, provided the social economic order of Soviet Russia was not affected by internaldisorders connected with these concessions, (iii.) The extent to which they were prepared to meet the Entente must,however, depend on the military situation, which they emphasised was improving from their point of view daily, (iv.) As regards the question of revolutionary international propaganda, the * Russian Soviet Government, while unwilling to limit the liberty of therevolutionary press, declared their readiness to enter into a generalagreement with the Entente Powers on their undertaking not to interfere in Russian internal affairs, (v.) Subject to the acceptance of the foregoing conditions, the SovietGovernment declared their readiness to begin conversations immediatelyeither at Prinkipo or elsewhere.This reply has remained unanswered to this day, and no further action hasbeen taken in regard to it by the Allied and Associated Governments.Subsequently, in March 1919, the so-called Bullit Mission proceeded to Russia, with the approval of Colonel House, in order to investigate the situation on behalf of the American Government, Mr. Bullit being a member of the United States State Department. We have no official information as regards the objects or results of this Mission, but two articles on the subject appeared in the Swedish Socialist newspaper, &quot; Politiken.&quot; According to the account given in the &quot; Politiken,&quot; some sort of preliminary agreement which was to form the basis of a future conference Was drawn up and approved by Mr. Bullit and the Soviet Government. The terms of this agreement were given as follows:-1. The Russian Soviet Government, the other Governments of the &quot;Russian Empire and the Allied and Associated Governments were to undertake jointly and severally not to attempt forcibly to overthrow any of the de facto Governments established in tjie territories of the former Russian Empire.2. The raising of the economic blockade, and the resumption of commercial&apos; relations between the Entente countries and South Russia. 3. A general amnesty to all political opponents and political prisoners.    All Russians who fought in or supported the armies opposed to the Soviet Government to be included in this amnesty. . 4. The mutual repatriation of Russian and Entente prisoners of war. 5. The withdrawal, on the signature of the agreement of all Entente troops, with the withdrawal of military support from anti-Soviet Russia; and the reduction of both the Soviet and anti-Soviet Governments&apos; armies. 6. The recognition by the Soviet and other Governments of. the financialLike the Prinkipo proposal, the Bullit agreement has become a dead letter, andLastly, there has been the Nansen proposal.In April 1919 Dr. Nansen addressed a letter to President Wilson, Mr. Lloyd George, M. Clemenceau and Signor Orlando, calling attention to the terrible condition of Central Russia, and proposing the organisation of food and medical relief on a ncn-political basis. A reply was sent on April 17 to Dr. Nansen, in which the President and his colleagues expressed their sympathy with the sufferings of the population of Russia, and declared that the organisation proposed by Dr. Nansen appeared to offer a practical means of coping with the situation. A proviso was, however, added that a cessation of hostilities and complete suspension of the transport of troops and war material to and within Russia was an indispensable condition.The comments of the Russian Soviet Government on the exchange of notes between Dr. Nansen and the heads of States of the Allied and Associated Governments were in due course received through the Russian Government wireless. They complained that this purely humanitarian proposal of Dr. Nansen had been distorted by the Western Powers into a political one; referred to their acceptance of the Prinkipo proposal which had. been frustrated by the proteges of the Associated Powers; and pointed to the anti-Bolshevik propaganda and anti-Jewish measuresnothing further has been heard of it.[293]B 2
which had been carried out by Polish and Ukrainian counter-revolutionaries under the direction of Entente officers. Attention was called to the manifesto of Admiral Kolchak, dispossessing the peasants of the land they had taken from the nobility, again with the approval of the Entente. Finally, the Soviet Government declared that they would only discuss a cessation of hostilities if the whole problem; of their relations with the opposing Governments was discussed at the same time.II. The Situation in Siberia, and the Sympathies of the Population in thatCountry.The defeats which have been inflicted by the forces of the Russian Soviet Government on those of Admiral Kolchak in Siberia have brought the unrest in the territories under the control of Admiral Kolchak to a head. But although many peasants in Siberia are now loudly proclaiming that they would prefer &quot; Bolshevism &apos;&quot;&apos; to the regime to which they are at present subjected, it would&apos;be inaccurate to deduce from this that they are in favour of Bolshevik rule in the form which i t assumed in its early stages in Russia proper. The present discontent may rather be attributed to a general feeling of war-weariness and to a sense of disappointment and hopes deferred. In addition to this there is much mistrust of the intentions of Admiral Kolchak and those by whom he is surrounded. The unwieldly bureaucracy of the Omsk Government, which consists of many members of the former Russian Imperial Government Offices, and the gross mismanagement, of public affairs generally, are largely responsible for the present feeling. Unpaid wages and compulsory military service assist in fanning the flames.In a recent telegram Sir Charles Eliot diagnosed the situation in the following terms: 1. The distribution of articles of prime necessity has been almost at a standstill, owing to the disorganisation of the Siberian Railway, and the rouble has fallen in value to such an extent that in the absence of articles for barter purposes the peasants will not exchange their food supplies except at exorbitant prices.2. The taxes imposed by the Omsk Government are unpopular, as the peasants believe that the term &quot;temporary Government&quot; implies that the taxes already imposed will be collected again when the next Government comes into power.3. Compulsory mobilisation is resented.   The population is tired of war and does not understand what is to be gained by fighting for a policy whichhas not bettered their economic condition. 4. Owing to the uncertainty of the situation, the peasants are reluctant to give up their arms, and attempts at disarmament cause them, to join the &quot;Bolshevik bands which ravage the country on either side of the siberian railway.5. The population is irritated by the illegal acts of some Government troops and by the extremely repressive measures of many Government officials.6. The Government is considered - reactionary in many quarters (especially where social revolutionary influence is strong) owing to its interference with representative institutions, such as- the Zemstvos and the Siberian Duma.&apos; As against this, General Dietrjchs, the Commander-in-Chief of the Siberian Army, maintains that the moral of the new drafts which are coming into the depots of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s armies is excellent, and that the population in the area where the Siberian armies are operating is friendly towards Admiral Kolchak&apos;s troops, iln the districts to the west of Omsk the population is reported by Brigadier Jack to be working well, although living is dear and raw material scarce.There can be no doubt that such trouble as exists in Siberia is concentrated mainly east of Lake Baikal, the sympathies of the population of the Lake in the zone of operations of the Siberian armies being more or less favourable to Admiral Kolchak.Ill-Deductions to be drawn from the Present Attitude of the Russian Soviet Government in Russia and in Siberia.What deductions can be made from the preceding summary of developments in Russia and Siberia?
So far as Siberia is concerned, the difficulties which confront Admiral Kolchak&apos;s Government in that territory are no safe guide to the attitude which the Allied Powers should assume to the Russian Soviet Government.The population of thirteen, millions all told is in any case negligible as compared with the masses in Russia proper, while the state of pubic feeling in Siberia is only that which ordinarily makes itself manifest in countries that have been subjected to defeat in war.As regards Russia proper, it would seem to have been sufficiently shown that the Russian Soviet Government are prepared to negotiate on conditions which may appear attractive at first sight. They agree to recognise the debts of the late Imperial Russia, to restrict Bolshevik propaganda, to grant concessions in Russia, to amnesty Russians in the anti-Bolshevik armies and even to maintain the border States of the late Russian Empire permanently in their present jurisdiction.On the other hand, the note addressed to Admiral Kolchak promising that leader continued assistance towards establishing himself in supreme authority in Russia, coming, as it has, after the Prinkipo, Bullit and Nansen proposals, would seem to make it impossible for the Allies to abandon his cause, even if they felt any inclination to do so; while the acts of the Bolshevik Government and forces continue to be in sharp contradiction to their professions.It may be that should we fail to carry through our present policy the effect will be to bring about some reconciliation between moderate opinion on either side in the contending groups in Russia, and that from this will result some new party with new men at its head, with whom we may be able to come to some understanding. But for the Allies at this juncture to adopt a policy favourable to the Russian Soviet Government would be disastrous, since the effect could only be that we should forfeit our good name with all our friends in Russia for many years to come, if not,for ever, play the game of the Soviet&apos; Government, and ultimately lose our whole hand in the country to Germany, who is only waiting to derive advantage from the uncertainties of Allied policy.It is also more than likely that such concessions as the Soviet Government may seem to be making would only be maintained long enough to enable them to secure a firm hold on supreme&apos;power, and that when they had served their purpose the policy of violent propaganda and detestable deeds would be revived.Foreign Office, July 17,1919.
