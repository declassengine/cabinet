BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT).SECRET.     /- /- WAR CABINET.O.T.7730,        / A&apos; v       CONTROL OP HAY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exohequer on Sir A. Geddes&apos; paper on Hay prices and supplies (G.T. 7675) and Lord Ernie&apos;s paper on the same subject (G.T.7704.)There can be only two justifications for Government purchasing at tills date.      The first is that private enterprise will not be sufficient to cover supply and the Government purchasing can cover It.      In the present case neither of these conditions is proved to exist.    (Compare Lord Ernie&apos;s memo.)   The second is that Government purchasing by the avoidance of competition can sometimes secure a larger supply for the same amount of money aa is required to pay for a smaller supply obtained by private enterprise.    There is always an exceedingly problematic advantage since Government purchasing cannot be restricted to the minimum amount which the circum-stances require and the tendency to overpurchase for the sake of safety is Inherent.    Again, even successful Government purchasing tends to discourage production and postpones further and further the day when things can be restored to b normal basis.The above considerations are more or less general.    The Board of Trade memorandum gives rise to oertain particular objections.    It is absolutely useless to fix maximum prices unless reeourse is to be had quite freely to oommandeering.    *t is particularly useless in the case of suoh a commodity as hay. for it is all held by producers who can themselves make very good use of it, I am convinced that no Government Department can face the difficulties involved in commancleering tye farmers5 hay. If the farmers&apos; hay is commandeered he r^ust be provided with other feeding stuffb,    The competition will merely be diverted an^ ^le result will be, Lord Ernie suggests, to compel the Government to trade in ell feeding stuffs. It is no good on the ckhor hand to fi$ maximum prices for imported hay since a maximum price, If effective, would-merely discourage Importation.    It Is true that the absence of control has its own evil consequences and in particular encourages speculation.    These evil consequences are, however, only the natural result of shortage and if they are to be avoided it can only be by the Imposition of rigid control at ell points.    I do not notice any suggestion that there should be any control over the use and distri-bution of hay,,The prospect of having to find about twenty millions sterling abroad for the purchase of hay is disturbing.    It is impossible to say whether this moneycan
can be found.    Any one particular commodity can, of course, be purchased in large quantities.    The question is how much we can afford in the aggregate and it ie a question to which it is very unsafe to guess the answer. The only way of learning the answer is to leave people to buy by private enterprise what the country can afford.    There are special difficulties which will necessitate the re-imposition of control in the Government purchase of certain staple foods, such as bacon.    Fe should bo chary of extending the list except where a case is proved up to the hilt.(Intd.)   A.C./17th July 1919.
