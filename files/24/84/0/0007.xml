(Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ffxcheguef) .I have to report to the &quot;&apos;ar Cabinet that I held a conference on the 14th July on the subject raised in the Memorandum which was submitted to me by the First Commissi oner of Works and which I recently circulated (G .T, 7.432) concerning the policy which is to be adopted in regard to Government owned houses.   Sir Alfred mond, Dr. Addison, and Mr. Kellaway attended the Conference, but the representatives of the Admiralty and Air Ministry were pre-venteci from being present.The conclusions at which the Conference arrived were as follows      &apos;(l) &apos; It was agreed that the Office.of Works should take over and complete all outstanding housing.-schemes, it being open to further consideration as to whether those houses which are only in an early stage of development should be proceeded with, either by Government, or. by local Authorities, or abandoned entirely, but any new scheme or doubtful scheme should be referred to the Ministry of Health and the Treasury for their concurrence before action,(2)   That it is undesirable that the Government should itself manage house;s and that every effort should therefore be made to transfer Government houses to Local Authorities or failing them to ap-provedPublic Utility &apos;societies.(3)   That the Ministry of Health should undertake the required negotiations with Local Authorities and. public Utility Societies in conference with the Department or Departments con-cerneci and the Treasury. .(4)   That temporary buildings should be no exception to the rules above stated in (2) and (3).(5)   That the terms on which temporary huts are to be sold should be reconsidered by the Treasury, Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Munitions in cc-operation.- the object being to find a fair price at which they can be offered to and used by the Local-Authorities to help in solving the existing Rousing problem.It was agreed that the price for this purpose would have to be less than the prices now secured by the Disposal Board for individual sales.(6)   That the Army Council be requested to expedite the handing over of hutments to the Ministry cf Munitions.1 I request Cabinet approval for these recommendations.(initialled)   A.&apos;C.15th July, 1919.
