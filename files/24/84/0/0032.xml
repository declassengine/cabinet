secret the Dominions and the Ratification of the Treaty of Peace. (Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)-A qu0stion&apos;has been addressed to me with regard to the above, which I feel unable to answer by myself, and as it appears of considerable importance I must beg for some guidance from the Cabinet.A weekly telegram is sent to the Dominions by the Colonial Office, which is drafted in the political and In-telligence Department of the Foreign Office.    One of these telegrams, dated 4th July, contained the following sentence: -&quot;It is hoped that the German Treaty may be ratified by three of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers by the end of July&quot;.It will be observed that this telegram does not expressly state that one of the 3 Principal Allied and Associated Powers will be Great Britain.    But it would no doubt be understood in that sense by the Dominions.In any case I received on July 9th the following message from Sir Robert Borden in a telegram from the Governor General:- -&quot;Your most secret telegram of July 4th respectingratification of Peace Treaty with Germany.    I am undera pledge to submit the Treaty to Parliament beforeratification on behalf of Canada.    No copy of theTreaty has yet arrived and Parliament has been pro-rogued.    Kindly advise how you expect to accomplishratification on behalf of the whole Empire before the   -end of July&quot;. is this qpi the question which I feel unable to answer. My difficulty is twofold.    In the first place I do not know, and I have been unable to ascertain from the ForeignOffice
Office, whether it is in fact intended that Great Britain should raMfy the Treaty before the end of July, In the ewearb place I do not see how that ratification could carry th9 assent of Canada, or, for that matter, of any of the other Dominions, before the Treaty had been approved by their several Parliaments, And yet, if His Majesty ratifies the Treaty, he necessarily does so for all his Dominions, as, according to the terms of the Treaty, the British Umpire appears in it asju^nitr on!&apos;of the 5 &quot;Principal Allied and Associated Powers0MWe ass thus-, as it seems to&apos;ma, face to face with a real constitutional dilemviia0 It ray be thought that it is a merely formal difficulty, but&apos;-, unless properly handled, I fear that it may lead to very unpleasant consequences.It seams to me evident from the terms of Sir Robert Borders telegram, that he would regard the ratification of the Treaty by &quot;the British Empire&quot; without the formal assent of Canada as an unwarrantable assumption of authority on the part of the Government of the United Kingdom,  And I em afraid that, the other Dominions are likely to take the same wiew.&apos; Moreover it appears to me that they would be justified in doibg so by the position which we have accorded, and, as I think, wisely accorded to them throughout the Peace nego&apos;tia* tions, and which finds expression in the Treaty itself, viz: that of equality of status with the United Kingdom as partners in the &quot;British Empire,&quot;It follows from this position, that, inasmuch as the King can, according to the principles of our constitution, only ratify a Treaty on the advice of his Ministers, he ought, in order to ratify the present Treaty for the whole Empire, to do so on the advice of all his Ministries - the Ministries&apos;&apos;of tliBr Self-Governing Dominions as well as that of the-United   &apos; Kingdom,Now, it is perfectly true that, in strict constitu-tional theory, the consent of Parliament is not necessary tothe
the ratification of a Treaty.    But in the present instance we have all, by common consent, waived the right to ratify without the consent of Parliament.    In this country the Treaty is being submitted to Parliament before ratifica-tion.   Sir Robert Borden has promised to do the same in Canada.    And to the best of my belief a similar promise has been given in the other Dominions,    If that is so, none of the Dominion Ministries can advise the King to ratify till their Parliaments have approved the Treaty,and if His lajesty ratifies it without their advice, at the instance of the British Ministry alone, tho Dominions may, and I fear will raise the point, that such action is in-consistent with the constitution of the Empire, as it has now developed.    Such a complaint on their part would be a grave and most regrettable disturbance of the harmony which, thanks to the policy pursued by the Prime Minister in Paris, has characterized the relations of the United Kingdom and the Dominions throughout the Peace negotiations.For these reasons l felt unable to answer Sir R. Borden&apos;s question and referred the matter to the Prime Minister.I reoeived a reply to the effect that the Prime Minister wished the matter to be settled by consultation between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office.I accordingly consulted Lord Curzon.    The only answer which he or I could suggest to Sir Robert Borden&apos;s question was that Sir Robert should call a special meeting of his Parliament at once in order to submit the Treaty to that body.A similar message would, I think, in that case, have to be sent to the otKer Dominions.In
In my 9fifil$$ ^jl ii to yisht but I lie sirtate tp takq it. without, tip. express approval- of the Cabinet, because it seems to, m, to involve an obligation on the part of the. British Government, which I cannot undertake on; my sole authority - viz - tha.t of waiting, before we f^llff the Treaty, until it has been  approved by t.he seyera.l Dominion, parliaments.If we are not prepared to wait, for that, approval, then I think we should be making an awkward situation worse and. not better by suggesting an immediate- convocation of Dominion Parliaments! for the purpose of approving a Treaty, which we mean to ratify without such approval.0n the other hand, if we do not answer Sir Robert B or den as above suggested, tlfi 1. do-, not, see what answer we-, can give to him at. al 1.I am- therefore ob.li.ge4. to ask for ins traction: frpjn; the- Cabinet as to the. course to be pursued.
