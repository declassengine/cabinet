The recent discovery of petroleum in Derbyshire makes it necessary to decide without delay on the policy to be adopted by His Majesty?s Government on this subject.   The most important question is that of tho property in the oil, i,e,, whother it shall belong entirely to the owner of the surface to be disposed of as he pleases, whother the latter shall be allowed a limited right of property measured by a fixed royalty, or whether owner-ship of the oil shall be vested solely in the State,Tho second of these alternatives was embodied in the Petroleum Bill which failed to pass the House of Commons in 1917, owing to the royalty provisions, and it would hardly be feasible now to press for terms more favourable to the landowner and to seek to give him unrestricted property in oil    The choice there-- fore appears-to lie between the allocation to the landowner of a small fixed royalty and.....the complete ownership of oil by theState, y,^-,ft:-;. IJn:S?5S S&apos; n^ ^ ftl!v .. t        .   The former of. these is not logical and might lead to, -difficulties in practice, but it would give to the landowner certain, though limited, rights and would secure his co-operation ..and. goodwill, , If, on. the other hand,, the. landowner is to have no property in oil found and is to receive only compensation for surface damages,..it will,be necessary to provide by legislation that licensees- shall have.the right of entry to privately-owned lands to search for petroleum.,   I am bound to say that from, a /Strictly business- point of view the co-operation of. the. landowners 5, would be cheaply, bought, by; the, payment, of a royalty., of. 9d,. per . ton, which,represents substantially less than 1 per cent of the present value at the well of American crude oil of similar grade,,.,-n M^sj^Mm^M^^&amp; MMMMM MMl II
to that v/hich has boon found in Derbyshire and which would have no appreciable effect on the prico of the refined products to the consumer.The rights of the surface-owner in the oil found bo-neath his land would appear to be recognised in all oil-producing Countries, except where. e,g, in the case of certain areas xn Trinidad, oil rights havo been expressly rosorved to the Crown* In Mexico His Majosty!s Government is protesting in the interests of British Oil Companies against the threat of the Carranaa Government to declare that the subsoil is the property of the State.   The royalties paid vary considerably in different countries, typical rates being for unproved lands lod- per ton in Mexico and l/8d, in Venezuela, and for proved lands 15/- per ton in Louisiana and 20/- in Russia.On the.other hand, the weight of opinion in this country appears to be in favour of vesting the pioperty in oil in the State without payment of royalty to the landowner.   In support of this view it may be urged that the possibility of petroleum being found beneath the surface can havo been taken into account in very few transactions in land in this country and that the case is therefore entirely different from that of coal and other minerals, the presence of which has continually affected the sale values of properties and in which there are now innumerable vested interestsc   Again, although traces of petroleum were previously found in borings sunk for other purposes, the whole cost of the first large-scale test made in the United Kingdom is being borne by the State, whereas in every other country the risk has been taken and the presence of petioleum proved by private enterprise.   Moreover, it would be an almost insoluble problem to devise any equitable scheme for the allocation of royalties asVbetween neighbouring land-owners, owing to the relatively small Bize of estates in this country and the impossibility of determining
from what point in a petroliferous area the supply tapped by any particular boring is actually drawn.It was in contemplation to refer this and other matters relating to the development of the petroleum res-ouroos of the country to a strong Committee whose report would bo submitted to the Cabinet but I understand from the Leader of the House that this question can more appropriately be dealt with by the Cabinet direct., I hope that an early decision can be reached as the whole procedure in connection with home-produced petroleum is meantime in suspense.   We are using the Defence of the Realm Act in obtaining entry for Messrs. Pearson to sites selected for borings, but legal action is being taken by the Marquess of Lothian to restrain them from drilling on his land and it is important that our policy under peace condi-tions should be settled at once.Pending legislation on the question of ownership, it seems very desirable that a public announcement should be made warning all concerned against entering into any dealings re-lating to land or oil rights on the assumption that the owner-ship of oil deposits will be treated by Parliament as inherent in the owner of the surface.I understand that the Petroleum Executive are in agreement with the views expressed in this Memorandum.  -17th July, 1919, &quot;&quot;  ..........&apos;&quot;&quot;  1  &apos; &quot;&quot;
