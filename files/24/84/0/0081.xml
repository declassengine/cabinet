Governor-Genera.!, Ottawo    (Sent, 11,5 p.n,, 22ndJuly, 1919.).Fo ilosing for your Prim? &amp;ini*ter..    Your tdejrarn more-t Secret J :ly 9th,    i have lie consulted the Prime Minister an 3 the Cabinet0   Our virp is this:iforly ratification is of the. hi^-h^st importance, esnccially now that Gerrwny hap ratified9 There is nothing in the British Constitution which makes it necessary for the King to obtain the consent of Parliament before ratifying a Treaty,   He can with perfect constitutional propriety ratify on the advice of his Ministers,     Certainly for a Treaty of this far-reaching importance, and one embracing the whole Empire, he ought only to act at the instance of all his constitutional advisers - the Dominion Ministries as well as that of the United Kingdom.    But inasmuch as Dominion Ministers participated in the Peace negotiations and signed the Preliminary Treaty side by side with Ministers of the United Kingdom, we hold that H,1L- if he now ratified the Treaty for the whole Empire, would have the same con-stitutional justification for doing so in respect of the Dominions as he has in respect of the United Kingdom.. By a single act he would bind the whole  hpire, as it is right that he should do, but that act would represent the considered judgment of his constitutional advisers in all the self-governing States of the Empire because it would be merely giving effect to an international pact: which they had all agreed to.At

telegram to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa,(Sent 2,30 p4m,, 23rd July, 1919.)Following for your Prime Minister, Now thatGermany has ratified Treaty of Peace it is of thegreatest importance that it should be ratified by us with the least possible delay as till this is done therecan be no definitive peace.   As you aro aware. HisMajesty can constitutionally ratify any treaty withoutconsent of Parliament.   British Government has howeverthought it desirable to submit Treaty to Parliamentwhere it will without doubt be approved in the courseof this week.    It is of course for you to decide whether you wish to submit Treaty to the Parliament of (Australia)(New Zealand)    before its ratification by His Majesty. (South Africa)If so, it would be necessary for you to doso immediately on your return,&apos; MILNER.
