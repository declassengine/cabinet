Russia and England, with a view to concerted action.   Buda Pesth is merely an outpoBt of the Russian Soviet Government.In Russia itself Bolshevism is beginning to ohoaage its oharaoter, and, if Lenin&apos;e administration falls, fears are expressed that tho power may pase into the hands of the anarchists, which will mean complete chaos.    In Buda Pesth, it is believed, any announooment of Allied intervention would be welcomed by more than nine-tenths of the population.Labour unrest is general throughout tho world, but it is beooming apparent that much of it is eoonomio and is part of the process of re-adjustment after tho sudden deoline in the purchasing power of money.   The extreme elements naturally take advantage of any unrest.While affairs in Holland and Switzerlaid are more stable, the position in Soandinavia soems to be ohongiug for the worse.m      Italy is in the throes of an industrial crisis, whioh may have ^profound political consequences.  Tho assistance given by theItalians to the Hungarian Communists may prove to bo a dangerousdouble-edged weapon.In/
In Franoe and Belgium there are anxious times ahead, but for the moment the Clemenoeau Government has soored a euooess over &quot;&quot; the extreme Sooiallsts, and there is no sign that Bolshevism is growing.The general strike in Canada is now definitely over, and the country seems likely to emerge from it sounder than it was before. The Btrikes in Australia have a definite revolutionary colour.      i)Detailed reports have been reoeived from Buenos Aires of a plot engineered by looal Germans to assassinate statesmen in Allied countries.    The necessary measures axe being taken.
PRANCE.Hie attitude of the publio, including that of the working classes, is one of rejoicing and general good - -   humour,    For the time being political and sooial questions are receiving little attention as the whole country is en &apos;  fSte,    In  i^ranoe the high boat of living is undoubtedly the root of the labour unrest and1 is being exploited to the full by the extremists&apos;/At Lyons and iMarseilies the sooial unrest is directly attributed to this oause and the Individual worker takes little interest in the politioal - aspeot of the agitation.    in spite of the indifferent attitude shewn by the bulk of the working classes to their propaganda, the extremists are still aotive.    lionguet1s , principal aim is the overthrow of the present government, the liberation of Oaillaux and a&apos;modification of the peace-terms in favour of.Germeny,    He has stated that he does not wish to see Bolshevism introduced into Prenoe, but he is in sympathy with the Soviet Government in Russia and advooates international action by the workers against the foroible repression of the ContmuhislT Governments in Mosoow and Buda Pesth;    Ihe action of the British Government in detaining lionet and ^OBBa^ for * few h^s at 1-oOkeBtone, ft detention which was afterwards withdrawn, though not in time to prevent them from returning to France, was generally approved by publio opinion in Franoe&apos;Uiere is evidenoe that there is a growing opposition to the extremists within the Confederation Generals du Travail. The more moderate section is suspioious of the militants and deteots in their wish to bring about the fall of M. Clemenoeau an attempt to promote the,, interests of Bolshevism and of Germany,   flais cleavage of opinion was noticeable during the first two weeks of the. Paris strike.   Indeed the recent striker may be looked upon as a struggle between the politioal and the professional/
(Foreign)professional elements in the labour and sboialistio ,   , movements in-whioh the professional element has won the day. - Ah interesting feature of the miners1 strike was the ^apparent split, between the northern and southern miners, but throughout the war there have always been signs of sooial discontent and disloyalty in the south of Iranoe,    M.     ^ .:..Longuet has little following in the..Chamber.&apos;;;   His name and ,. itbat of M; hyenas were purposely omitted -from the ....... Parliamentary Commission on the Peaoe -treaty and after muolj. bickering all the, Socialist members nominated to the ^Commission registered their protest by deolining to Berve.Useful propaganda is being carried on among the working classes by the &quot;Union Rationale des Combattants&quot; by means of posters whioh explain olearly the harm whioh industrial unrest is doing to the oountry.    These posters have attracted a great deal of attention.   , The Army does not . appear to be affected by extremist propaganda;    The .. -announcement, of.the early demobilization of a nSimber of fi..,  classes has had an excellent effect, , Military intervention in Russia is looked upon with disfavour by the troops, more because it would delay demobilization .than for politioal . u , reasons;&quot;  The&apos; recent unrest in the Navy was probably&quot; due to the same desire for demobilization.      V-i -..The presence of the Irish.delegates in Paris-has&apos; begun to make itself seriously felt and ,th,evSyndicalists and Socialists are using the opportunity to foster ariti-British feeling, . .^ ; ., :&apos;ihe official aooeptentfe of the peaoe terms by Germany was received oalmly by the Belgians and there was a .       J noticeable restraint in the criticism of its provisions&apos; relating/
relating to the future position of Belgium.    The feeling iq beginning to prevail that the desired Colonial expansion, which is of but importance to the shipping community in Antwerp, will be arranged amicably with the British.    At the same time there is no diminution in the unpopularity of Great Britain owing mainly to the influence of oertaln French newspapers which are widely read in Belgium.    The impression that the sinking of the German fleet was done with the taoii^ approval, if not with the aotuai oonnivanoe,of the British Authorities seems to be gaining ground.    The choice of Rotterdam, instead of Antwerp, as the base for the British Army of the Rhine is also severely criticised.    The high prices of neoessary obrnmodities, and the electioneering efforts of the Socialists tend to create political unrest, but, on the whole, eoonomio conditions are improving.    The oommeroial and industrial classes anticipate a revival of trade and a consequent fall in the high rate of foreign exchange as a result of the signing of peace.    It is reported that large orders are daily being given to British manufacturers some of whom are oritioised beoause of their unwillingness to quote definite prices.    (She port of Antwerp is gradually assuming a more normal appearance, but the number of unemployed is said to be approximately 80,000.    The iron industry, especially in the neighbourhood of Mons, is rapidly being re-established.On the other hand a high Police offioial is of opinion that serious industrial disturbances are to be expected in, the Charleroi district in the Autumn and Winter, and that there will be a coal famine throughout Belgium during the: winter... ...  .  ...... - , - sThe Swiss, as a whole, may be regarded as firmeragainst Bolshevism than they were.    The offioial recognitionaodorded/
aooorded to the &quot;Gardes Civiques&quot; and the efficiency of the organisation of this force have acted as a strong deterrent . to Bolshevism in Switzerland,The Bolsheviks, however, are still very aotive and are busily engaged in propaganda work, especially among the troops.    It is reported that the riots at Zurioh in June were led lay 200 German agents and were arranged at Hamburg and Munich;in indirect communication with Mosoow.Wyss, the workmen1s seoretary, who was arrested in oonsequenoe of the part he took in the Zurioh riots, is a well known German agent and was in possession of 58,000 roubles, presumably intended for Bolshevik propaganda, and also a oertain amount of literature, part of whioh was destined for Ireland.   He intended to go to Ireland, but has been detained by the Zurich police.As a result of the extensive Bolshevik propaganda by Russian, German and Jewish agents a new party called the *Partie Communists Internationalists&quot; haB sprung into existenoe at Zurich. , It is formed from the militant Socialist party, and is in ooamunioation with Perioat, Brizon and other Bolsheviks in Paris and Lyons.    Perioat, indeed, is the founder of the party and is endeavouring to enrol under its banner all militant socialists, anarohists and syndicalists.The Independents and Communists are continuing their aotivity, but they are not engaged upon much open propaganda beoause they realise that the mass of the population is tired of the revolutionary game and the crimes committed by the Spartaolsts.    The recent riots in Hamburg and other German towns were intended to introduoe a Spartaoist Irevolution, whioh was to have spread throughout the tohole oountry.    This was frustrated beoause the Hamburg outbreakwas/
was premature and the Government measures and the opening of the port will soon restore order.    At the same time Bauer is said to incline to the Left and it is feared that he may indirectly encourage the development of a soviet ... Government.    In spite of ifoske?s assertion that the Government oould no longer reckon upon the support of the Army for the maintenance of order if the Peace Treaty were signed, the overtures of the Spartaoists to the soldiers do not appear to have met with muoh success.    TCiere is always the possibility that, owing to the dissatisfaction of the military party at losing power and the general dislike of the terms of peaoe, a military coup d&apos;otat may be attempted.    The control whioh Ludendorff and the General Staff exercise over the old Communist party and whioh has forced the Spartaoists to form a new organization is of importance in this connection -The Government is said to fear the return of the prisoners of Was? who, it is thought, will considerably strengthen the Communist Party. &amp; ^/ii.. Ihe strike movement organized by the Communist elementis somewhat mor^aoutev but the offioial leaders of the/&apos;&apos;,&apos;-/ - - -workmen1s. organizations, are not in favour of strikes -their main reason being that most of their funds are invested in German War Loans and oonsequently can only be realised at great finanoial loss.    In the oase of,a general strike, the Government is oonfident that it can work the railways an(J the prinoipal industries of the oountry.Ihere is muoh anxiety among the people generally at the alleged disappearance of German capital.    An organized system of smuggling money and securities abroad is said to be in progress espeoially in the zone occupied by the Frenoh. and it is asserted that German and Frenoh capitalists are working the business together.In/
In Cologne the politioal tendencies are unsettled, bi there are signs that the more law-abiding elements of the population are gaining the upper hand. The Khinelandera as a whole, have aooepted the peaoe quietly. Dr. Darten leader of the party whioh attempted to establish a Khenist, republic is still at liberty and holding meetings unde:) Frenoh proteotion.The trial of the German Spartaoists who attempted to , undermine the discipline of the British troops in Cologne has been concluded. Four of the prisoners were acquitted and four found guilty. The conspiracy was an elaborate c which apparently originated in Russia. The leading part taken in this conspiracy by Phillips Prioe and Robert Mino the American journalist, has been the subjeot of a Special . Report.    Both are now at liberty.Soheidemann, who arrived in Switzerland on June 24th, staying at Au near Zurich with the notorious &quot;PARVCS&quot;, i inoident oonfirms the belief that &quot;Parvus&quot; or Helphand was and is an agent of the German Government;,    Soheidemann issaid to be engaged in a soheme for German propaganda in Fi...... &apos; . -    ^..... -A report, as yet unconfirmed, states that both Hind en and Ludendorff are expected in Switzerland.ITALY.    J. -Conditions in Italy appear to be somewhat ohaotio, bu &apos; : the general tendency is towards the Left.    The fall of th Orlando ministry was mainly due to its failure to prevent \- profiteering and to its polioy of drift.    She new Govemm is meeting-with many difficulties and its position is by nt means secure.Strikes due&apos;to high pribes and shortage of food havf v   taken place all over the country and there have been violen disturbances in Florenoe and in several towns of Romagna.
V 52It i^ fco*siJxl*vth^ -oharaoter with serious results,    The Government haB succeeded In restoring order in most places and is attempting to reduce the price of food,, Italian publio feeling is now definitely hostile towards Great Britain, Fronoe and the United States.    This hostility assumes oonorets shape in the propaganda against the Peace Treaty, whioh is being parried on in Switzerland by Italian extremists, who are provided with regular.4 passports, and by the commercial negotiations whioh are proceeding with the Germans.    There is also a definite rapproohement between Italy and the Communist Government in Hungary.   The Italians make no mystery about their Hungarian policy which they oonsider neoessary as a defence against the Jugoslavia, - The tension between the Frenoh and the Italians at Flume reached a olimax on the 8th of July, when there was a serious riot between the soldiers and marines of the two countries In Whioh there were numerous casualties.,fi Reports indioate a growing dissatisfaction with theCommunist dictatorship on the part of the workers and also of former supporters of Bela Kun.    It la believed that an announcement that an Allied polios operation against the Communist oligarohy would bring over a great part of the Bed Army.    The Trades Unions in the town whioh lnolude all the . workmen are said to be anxious to form a Social Democrat Government under the, protection of Great&apos;Britain.   They would :.: like a British General Officer to go to Buda Pesth with a strong mission and escort whioh need not exceed a battalion as there would be no fighting.    Possibly as a result of its growing unpopularity the Government has undergone a oomplete change.    The number of.the People&apos;s Commissaries has been reduoed from 36 to 11 and the ilxtremists have been eliminated.Bela/
Bela Kun&apos;s&apos; avowed foreign polioy that there oan be no question of oompromise with the Entente is approved byi - i      ..... &apos; - i &apos; &apos; . &apos; &apos; &apos;    &apos;1 &apos; .Lenin, with whoa there is almost daily communication by wireless.    Kun&apos;s aeroplane service has broken down.    The counter-revolutionary party is reported to be less anxious for the intervention of the Entente than it was, as it 1b thought that onoe the Red Army has cleared the Country of %Czeohe and Roumanians it will turn against the existing Government. Although nominally Bela Kun has withdrawn hie army from Slovakia, he has actually only rechristcnod his troops with the name of the Slovakian Red Army. There is no doubt that the Italians are selling arms and other supplies to the Hungarians, The eoonomio situation in Buda Pesth is serious as the peasants still refuse to brin food into the town* and the Government has to send out foraging parties whioh enoounter considerable resistance. The output of the Socialized factories has diminished 50$ compared with the output before the war. The reason given for this is that the old capitalist discipline has -gone and that the new spirit of Communist discipline has not yet permeated into the minds of the workers.AUSTRIA..She Austrian Communis* Party is in direot contaot with&apos; and is receiving, funds for propaganda purposes frost the Hungarian Soviet Government.    The objeot of the Hungarian Government is of course to overthrow the existing Government in Austria and to replace it by a Soviet Government.The Austrian Communists are also in touch with the Bolsheviks in Sweden througi whom apparently they reoeive their orders from Moscow.    A special Bolshevik emlssarj) Is being sent to Vienna.    Dr. Bauer, the AustrianForeign/
(Fereign)

Foreign Minister, who has Bolshevik sympathies, is thought to be waiting for a favourable opportunity for effecting a union between Austria and the Spartacists of Germany and the Soviet Government in Hungary. The Communist party has certainly received direct support from Germany in the form of 50,000,000 marks which was sent to Vienna on the 26th of June.

The acceptance of the peace terms by the German Government has given rise to a hope that the Entente Powers will deal more leniently with Austria.

ROUMANIA

A Bolshevik outbreak is Said to be unlikely, first because of the new sentiment of nationality whioh has swept the Country, and secondly, owing to the improved economic conditions. The people are not contented with their Government, but are acoustomed to being misgoverned. In Bessarabia there is danger of Bolshevism spreading. Propaganda is being carried on from Kieff by Dr. Rakovsky, the Russian Soviet representative.  Revolutionary agitators in the Dobrudja are being arrested by the order of the Minister of the Interior.

BULGARIA

There is evidence of considerable Bolshevik activity in Bulgarian Thrace which is being carried on my Turks and Bulagrians. A considerable amount of money and arms has been distributed.

MONTENEGRO

It is reported that the Montenegrins have revolted against the Serbian "Occupation" and that sanguinary fighting has taken place.

GREECE/
(Foreign)

GREECE

Bolshevik propaganda is still active in Greece, but, although the Bolshevist agents can move about the Country freely as there is no proper supervision, it is doubtful Whether their efforts will be successful as the Greeks are thoroughly, tired of the Russians. Some German of officers have been discovered at Athens disguised as Russians and German agents are said to be endeavouring to induce Greeks to stir up trouble in Egypt. There is a recrudescence of royalist propaganda in Greece which is causing some

anxiety.

TURKEY

A large sum of money has been deposited with the Constantinople branch of the Russian Central Union Consumers Society. The money seems to have been sent from Moscow and in no doubt intended for Bolshevik propaganda. Revolutionary propaganda throughout the East is also being carried on by an important Committee in Constantinople which is in touch with the Young Turk Party. In the war this Committee was assisted by the German Ambassador.

CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.

Early in June the high prices of food and the profiteering whioh was prevalent caused considerable discontent and unrest which led to a good deal of criticism of the Government. Since then, however, President Masaryk appears to have succeeded in establishing a firmer system of control. The distribution of food supplied by the Allies is also working with success and, although prices are still high, there is no serious dearth of food. In spite of the revolutionary disturbance organized by Muna, the leader of the miners, in the Kladno district in June, there appears to be no indigenous Bolshevism in Czecho-Slovakia and the labour unrest is probably due to economic causes. President Masaryk/


Masaryk has stated that his only anxiety with regard to Bolshevism among his people is the danger of unemployment on a large soale and he is consequently anxious that the British Government should supply the oountry with the raw materials whioh are essential for its industries.   Bela . Run Is doing everything In his power to involve President Masaryk In direot communications with him, but the President has definitely refused his overtures.The moral Of the Czech army has apparently improved since the French took over the oommand and fighting a ;-   oommori&apos; enemy has had a good effect in promoting friendly relations between, the Czechs and the Slovaks.RU33IA ::The position of the Bolshevik Government is reported to he less secure and there are signs that it may be superseded by an anarchist regime.whioh will mean a period of absolute chaos.    Lenin is reported to have submitted an offer of peace to Roumahia,    This news tends to confirm the recent despatches telling of the serious disintegration whioh Is going oh in Soviet Russia, particularly as the - , offer comes at a time when from a military point of view the Bolsheviks may be considered to be in a stronger position than for some time past.    It is possible, however, that Lenin&apos;s desire to come to terms with the Roumanians may bd due merely to his desire to release his troops on the Dniester for employment against the Finnish forces in the neighbourhood of Petrograd.  ...The religious revival in Russia among all olasses of the population is becoming a menace to Lenin&apos;s government. The church is by degrees grouping together all the various elements of sooiety which ore opposed to Bolshevism.   In the oentral and northern provinces of Great Russia this movement has taken the form of &quot;Adventism&quot; and the peasantssay/
say that Lenin is antMJhrist,  &apos; The Bolsheviks recognise the gravity of this movement and have Ceased to perseoute the&apos;;olergy.    Lenin has also yielded to the peasants&apos; food s   blockede and h&amp;s permitted them to import viotuals, although the fcreaoh whJ.oh this means with the Staters monopoly of trade is said to have weakened his position with the extremists.   The prioe of food and the neoessaries of life rise oontinually, but this may be attributed to the oontrol whioh is exercised by the Government rather than to an actual shortage, beoause prices are said, to rise as the Whites advanoe and to go down when they suffer a reverse.The Soviet propaganda oentre in Odessa is working energetically to   spread Bolshevism in the J3ast.    Special committees are appointed for India, Persia&apos;, Turkey and Bjgypf;    Ittiore has also been founded in.Moscow a League of  astern Freedom with;a branoh in Pojrograd, where many ;      native&apos;agitators are prepared for service in the East.    A -: special&apos;obur3&apos;e of lectures is being given on the ways and means of spreading Bolshevism in Mohammedan countries. &apos;   Hassen Shahed Suhrawardy, a member of. a well-known Calcutta family and one of Lenin1 s intimate friends,, is in oharge of &apos; thie&quot; branch.The Bolsheviks of the Ukraine appear to be working in olofte&quot;:touch with the Communists at Buda Pesth.    Two emissaries from the Ukrainian Government reoently suooeeded &quot;- ih:reaoh&apos;ihg Buda Pesth and stated that the oppressive rule - Of the Whites &quot;and the interference of the Entente in the Ukraine was oausing considerable discontent.    The food &apos; situation in the Ukraine is no better than elsewhere in Russia, but the harvest promises to be a good one.POLAND.There is considerable danger that the present government/
I   ;: (   f*-\&apos;t  *f* ft * 1 ;V\*-(Foreign) - 13 -^Government may be overthrown 1^ the Radioals.   ,Some members of the .tovernmentflndeed,are aopused of. being Bolsheviks at heart and some importantpostsuin the Ministry of Labour are held by Bolsheviks. . /Unemployment and lack of food combine , to damp the national enthusiasm.    The Lithuanians are extremely discontented on account of the annexionist intentions of the Poles,and the entire ^population is stated to be as ready to defend its independence against the Poles . as against the Russian&apos; Bolsheviks.It is reported that the &amp;wiss Consul in Warsaw is a &apos;    German Agent&apos;and that he is issuing Swiss passports to Germans in order to assist them to work in Poland.The majority of the Finnish working class is hostile to an advance on Petrograd.    It is even suggested that there should be a strike if war ,1s declared on Soviet.Russia.    The &apos;;* Finnish nationalists are calling for the union with Finland of Karelia upon^-which they maint(ain that Great Britain has designs.    , im)qq,&amp;      txiKkThe Bolsheviks-are .. yery^aojiven&amp;i,Finland&apos; and preparation are being made for a new Red uprising whioh, it is thought, may break out at any moment.    The delay by kolchak in the recognition of Finnish independence has oaused a bad - impression in Finland. S&apos;ii       &amp;kd &amp;iiJRie relations between officers and men in the Finnish \,/-\toix-lB--.Baid:.tiP.v-hftve be en ^improved during the, skirmishes &quot;with the Bolshevik forces on the.,frontier., with the result that the troops are becoming distinctly $nti-Bolshevik.mm iwnxmThe Baltio Barons, the German element, are anxious for Ssthonla and Livonia to form part of a mighty RussianFederation/
Federation, beoause they consider that these two oountries oan never be self-supporting.   Mr view is also held by a proportion of the population whioh,although extremely socialistic,is dimly conscious of the eoonomio difficulties ahead.   There are few Jews in  sthonia and the JSsthonlans do not want them.    Aooording to the Constitution, Jews are given votes, but are not allowed to hold offloe in the Government,mm-The proposals of the Parliamentary Commission on prof its, whidh recommend that workmen and officials should have a considerable share in the management of industrial oonoerns and that in all works there should be formed a special oounoil composed of representatives of the workmen, offioials and owners, are a noteworthy enoroaohment on the private management of industry.    It is probable that the Bill, whioh also contains provisions to establish throughout the oountry district counoils for each industry, a Joint industrial council for the whole oountry and a speoial court of appeal for the settlement of industrial disputes, will arouse violent opposition.,    There has been an epidemic of fires in Norway opourring mainly at places where work in conneotion with national defenoe is In progress.    The origin of these fires has not yet been discovered, but Bolshevik agents are suspeoted.    The continuous Bolshevik propaganda has caused such restlessness among the labouring olasses and such uneasiness among the other classes Of society that the publio is ready to believe anything.It appears that there is an organization in Christiana,with branches in other oountries, called the ;)S% &quot;Israelitio/
(Foreign)&apos;- . i* 15 -*Israe 11 tip Young Men&apos;a Association&quot;, which is used to . impregnate Zionism with Bolshevik ideas and to form a Jewish radical world union.Bolshevik&quot; propaganda from Russia and Norway is having considerable Influence oh the Communists in Sweden.    At a oonferenoe of the Swedish Left Socialist Fartjj which was conducted at Stockholm on the 14th of June, it was deoided that, the party whioh favours the abolition of the Army should adhere to the Third International.In the new First Chamber whioh is to assemble at the extraordinary sitting of the Riksdag in August,it is probable that the Conservatives will more or less balanoe the Sooial Demooraba.    The Liberals would then be able to throw in their weight on either side of the scale.    Their policy, therefore, is a question of considerable interest. It is possible that the Liberals and Conservatives may form a bourgeois block in opposition to the Sooial Democrats.A printers&apos; strike began on the 4th of July and the following day a strike was declared by the Swedish Seamen&apos;s Union.    The latter strike was settled almost immediately as the shipowners agreed to the men&apos;s demands *- .an eight hours working day and a standard rate of pay.     The other strike continues but the daily papers are appearing in spite of it.The German Legation at Stockholm now employs a staff of 200 and its seoret servioe work has enormously increased during the last few months.DENMARKThere is definite evidenoe that the Copenhagen dook strike was supported fey Bolshevik and Spartacist funds. It is also stated that the dook labourers Union received100,000 Kr,/
The elections passed off more quietly, than was expected, although there were disturbances in-certain distriots.    The Government has met the Cortes,.   It is not considered likely that there will be any fusion between Maura&apos;s Government and the Conservatives led by Senor Dato, in spite of the efforts of the, King to bring about union between the two leaders..The shortage of bread at Barcelona, where the bakers&apos; shops were olosed in the last week of June, led to., considerable unrest and the Military Governor was oompelied to publish further warnings to remind thepeople/100.floo-skr. toassist the strikers.The heads of the Zionist Bureau at Copenhagen, who have been bross^examined by the polioe, deny that their organization has any oonneotion with BoJjBheVism, and it appears certain that the Bureau as suoh is not Bolshevik. The international Zionist leaders are opposed to Bolshevist but their organization is a very large one and there are many Bolsheviks among the Zionists, especially in  astern Europe.. ,Humours of a General Strike in Holland beoome moreinsistent.   The seat of the movement appears,to be inAmsterdam, and there is a certain amount of unrest in theProvinoe of Groningen between the agricultural labourersand their employers.A Communist meeting at Flushing on .the 2nd of june was not Buooessful, and vigorous Bolshevik propagandaappears to have ceased since the eleotions, but Troelstra, who is beooming more and more extreme in his politioal -views, is very popular.    .
people that&apos;Martial Law was still in foroo.   The Home Rule politicians seised the opportunity to attack the Spanish Government and to point out that suoh a state of affairs oould not exist if the provinoe had its own Government.It is reported that Count Bassewltss, the German Consul at Madrid, gave a large sum of money to the proprietor of the newspaper ffEl Dian to assist his campaign against the Allies in favour of less onerous terms for the Germans,Tho strike movement is taking a serious turn.   All the metal factories are shut do^n, the owners having declared that the workmen must aooept their conditions before the faotories re-open,   A general railroad strike has just been declared without notice, and most of the-railway services are suspended,    Owing to the suspension . of a Socialist newspaper for two days, beoause it had criticised the conditions of peace, the printers&apos; throughout Portugal struck,and, with the exception of five Socialist newspapers, the press is at a standstilliThe Government, however, believes that it oah rely/ . upon the support  of the Army.EGYPT   &apos;   &apos; &apos; &apos;  ; .Except fpr a few minor disorders the situation in Egypt is quiet.   The calm in the provinces is probably;a true refleotion of the feeling of the peasants, who are only interested in their props; in the towns, on the other ; hand, it is caused by fear of the action which would be taken against agitators.   There is definite proof that the German Pan-Islamio Propaganda Bureau in Berlin, is in&apos; &quot; ,: : JV.Q -*&amp;i7 (:&apos;:;f,&apos;touch with the Egyptian Delegation in. Paris, through&apos; the-agenoy of the French Revolutionary Socialists.    During thelast few weeks the members of the Delegation ore reportedtat/
to have divided into three groups; (i) Those who are indifferent;   (2) Those who are for a compromise with thi British Government and (3) The irreoonoilables, headed l\ Zaglul Fasha.    There is considerable talk of boycotting Lord Milner*s mission when it arrives in Egypt in the autumn.    There appears to be no connection between the til extremists in Egypt and the Bolsheviks.INDIA ,&apos;    Wie politioal situation in India is reported to.be steadier.

It is obviously their policy to keep open the road to Asia,and the organisation which has been started in Mosoow and Fetrograp: (see Russia) is no doubt designed for this purpose.PERSIAA Persian revolutionary committee, the objeot of whioh is to proclaim a republio in Persia in olose relations with Russia and Germany, has been formed in, Switzerland.    Its headquarters are at Berne and it appears to be a branoh of an extensive Persian revolutionary organisation in the East.   Some of the members of the Committee are Persians who supported the first Persian Revolution, and belong to the Russian School of Revolutionaries.The examination of a Persian member of Parliament of the old &quot;Democratic&quot; party, who has been, for nearly three years, in Germany, throws more light on the German, intrigues of the Indian Revolutionary Party in Berlia.It seems quite clear that several Persians of some prominence in their country were, and are still, intriguing, with German backing, against any form of British influence in Persia;BRITISH CBOWN colonies the riots in Malta, which began on the 7th of June, were due to the unsatisfied demand for a, Constitution, the high oost of living and the disoontent caused by the fact that British workmen in Malta are paid,higher wages than, the Maltese labourers.The leaders of the movement were Enrico Mizzi, who has been previously obmyioted for a similar offence,and/

Hookstra, who also uses the name "N.V. Hookstra, Agenturen."

A room containing samples of South African goods has been opened in the offices of Kuyper, Van Dam &amp; Smeer, at Rotterdam, and the "Volkstem" is advertised in the Dutch Press as the best medium in South Africa for all Dutch commercial advertisements, etc. It is believed that these efforts to promote intercourse between Holland and South Africa are due to General Hertzog.

The presen? of De Valera in America has attracted attention to Ireland. His appel for £1, 000,000 to finance the Irish Republic, however, has not been given much publicity in the Press, and the American public does not seem inclined to treat him very seriously. There is not much reply to the extravagant propaganda which is being carried out in favour of the Irish Republic.

Everything points to the unabated activity of the German Secret Committee in Buenos aires. Its main attention at the present time appears to be directed to making arrangements for the assassination of prominent ministers of the Entente. Certain precautions have been taken to secure the arrest of Emissaries, whose names are known, on their arrival in Europe.

Although the tramway strike at Buenos Aires, has ended by the men returning to work unconditionally, and the labour situation is quieter on the surface, there is yet a strong undercurrent of unrest among the labouring classes. A League, entitled the Liga Patriotica Argentina, has been formed in the Argentine to combat the exorbitant demands of Labour. It is said to be supported by the Army and Navy and is intended to encourage a respect for law and order as opposed to Bolshevism
