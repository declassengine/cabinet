I. AGRICULTURE.

1. Wart Disease of Potatoes.

With a view to ensuring that an adequate supply of pure sood potatoes will be available for planting in those areas in England and Wales and Scotland that have been scheduled as infected with wart disease, the Board have made arrangements as in last year for the inspection of growing crops of the varieties immune from wart disease. Under the Wart Disease of Potatoes Orders potatoes of the immune varieties cannot be sold for planting except under licence granted by the Boards and such licences are only granted when there is a reasonable assurance that the stocks are pure and the condition of the crop satisfactory.  The most reliable guarantee of purity is the Certificate issued in cases where the crops on inspection have been found to be true to type and free from rogues. Growers of potatoes of the immune varieties in Scotland have accordingly been asked to make immediate application for the inspection of their crops.

About 1800 applications have been received to date and it is proposed to commence inspections within the next few days.
