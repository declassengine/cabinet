COLONEL DALLy. JOwE(P 3981&quot;)        From Secretari/ of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department-,mh July lMd.Priority A.   Clear the line.Foreign Secret. Your telegram. No. 1014 S., dated 10th July. Afghanistan. I have carefully, reconsidered, entire case in view of your comments, which, throw light, on certain parts of it which were previously obscure. For instance, I did not realise from your telegram No. 954 of 29th June that, with- a view to securing immediate peace, you proposed to give Amir a definite time limit for acceptance or rejection of preliminary Treaty. This seems to preclude modification of any of its Articles, and discussion which you anticipate,- and with regard to which you. plead for reasonable latitude, will apparently be confined to the conditions included in written statement to be handed to Afghan envoys. I presume that, if Amir refuses preliminary Treaty, you are prepared for the immediate resumption of hostilities, which you contemplate as inevitable sequel.If you prefer this method of procedure, relying, as I gather, upon weakness or impecuniousness of Amir to bring him into a more tractable frame of mind in six months&apos; time, His Majesty&apos;s Government does not desire to interfere with your discretion. Experience of previous Afghan negotiations teaches us that, as a rule, they pursue a very different course from that anticipated ; and that no instructions given in advance can provide for all situations that may arise.I am not quite clear, however, as to nature of discussion with Afghan delegates which you anticipate about your six conditions for renewal of friendship in six months&apos; time. If they are merely to consist of a written statement of our aspirations, you will doubtless include your own proposals as well as the additions suggested by us. But I should be sorry if anything was said or done to indicate that a substantial change in our political relations with Afghanistan is contemplated by us, or that we can view with indifference a repudiation of obligations hitherto acknowledged, or a revival of Afghan intrigues with other Powers. Indeed, Amir&apos;s own language (see your telegram No. 786 S., dated 1st June), that he is &quot;in no case desirous of upsetting old obligations and old relations,&quot; presupposes their renewal. I think it should be made quite clear that restoration of subsidy and other privileges, even in a modified form, will be dependent on satisfactory solution of this as well as of subsidiary questions.Above all, I hope that your delegates will remember, as you have yourself previously pointed but, that, though the Amir does not consider himself beaten, and will argue as though Afghan friendship is something that, in view of threatened Eastern complications, we cannot dispense with, and must expect to pay for at an enhanced price, this position cannot be accepted by us. On the contrary, our attitude to Afghan delegates, white as cordial as their own behaviour may justify, should leave them in no doubt that Amir has been guilty of waging utterly unprovoked war, and is now suing for peace in order to escape inevitable consequences of his act. In a word we, and not he, are the victors.Upon one point there would seem to have, been a misunderstanding. I never suggested or contemplated the forcible acquisition of Dakka. Indeed, I did not refer to Dakka in this context at all. As to the Jand on riverbank at Kam Dakka, please refer to correspondence conducted by Government of India with Amir liabibullah Khan in 1903-04 (see Government of India&apos;s Secret Despatch No. 172, dated 29th October 1903, and connected correspondence), from which you will see that same point was under discussion then, and was on eve of being referred to an Anglo-Afghan Boundary Commission, which would have endeavoured to secure readjustment of frontier,at this spot, in return for concessions at Bohai Dag. If frontier is to be delimited from Sassobi to Nawa Ivotal, some such arrangement would appear to bo both possible and desirable now.1 hope that this telegram, following upon general indication of our views in previous telegrams, will give you both the latitude and the. guidance that you desire. If any departure is proposed from principles thus laid down, reference should be made to His Majesty&apos;s Government,1v:n. is th(0161
