The total area of jfid administered by the Board remains the same&quot; as last week, namely, 548 acres.,     The estate, at Wainflaot comprising 1,778 acres Ttioned in last week1 s report is being purchased for .-286,000 and, st of the land is suitable for sub-division intoholdings of from to 40 acres for mixed farming.The number of ex-service men now on the l?arm Settlements is 1, an increase of 27 over last week.     In addition    16 men have ion accepted as probationers but have not yet commenced work.laThe reports received show that at ^^rinj^bon work is going satisfactorily, and all crops have greatly&quot;benefited by the rain, now set of steam tackle, has cultivated 28 acres once, and 110 lies twice during the week, and is working well,     The remainder of p peas of the 1918 crop have been sold during the week at satisfactory [ices, namely, blue; peas at  10 per quarter and Dun Peas at  6,10. p quarter.
At SpJJJgach nearly all the hay has &quot;been harvasted.    The settlers are carting their early potatoes.     38 settlers are in possession of their holdings at this Settlement, and a selection is being mado from the 34 probationers with a view to allocating the 24 further holdings that will bo available at Michaelmas next.    The remaining 10 probationers will continue to work on the Central Farm until extra cottages have been erected.(* At Heath Hill a splendid week has enabled good progress tobe made with thVwork of4 cutting and carting the settlers&apos; hay.    A surveyor from the Office of Works has visited the Settlement in connection with the repairs to the existing buildings, but the building of the new cottages has not yet been commenced.At Amesbury rapid progress has been made with the hay harvest which is nearly complete and the corn harvest will commence in about 14 days&apos; time.    Potatoes are very backward owing to the dry season.    At Rplieston, about 130 acres of seeds and meadow hay has been carted.    Hay making is proceeding satisfactorily at Pembrey, as well as the cleaning of fallows.    More labour is required but cannot be accommodated until the huts have been erected.Representatives of the Officers&apos; Farming Association visited Bosbury during the week, and formed the opinion that some of the land is suitable for the requirements of several of their members.    The difficulty of accommodation again prevents immediate progress being made with the development of this Settlement but the Secretary of the Association- considers that many of the officers would be prepared to live in converted huts-      &quot;Pour Army huts have been ordored through the Office of Works.     It has been decided to utilise the Wantage property as a Settlement for ex-officers and educated women of the Land Army,In view of the favourable prices of store cattle at the present timeadditional stock has been purchased for the Settlements where keep is available, namely 129 for Pembrey, 46 for Heath Hill and 21 for Patrington.(ii) Provision of Allotments.Br i st o 1 ,mG o rpor at ion entered on the Buffalo Bill&apos;a Held, Horfield, early in 1918, and handed over the arrangements for the cultivation of the field to the Horfield Allotments Association. tfha Bristol Rugby Club now desire to resume possession of the field, and,, in view of the desirability of&quot;the restoration of recreational land in urban areas to its former use, the Board provisionally recommended the Corporation in this case to withdraw from possession at the end of the present year and this the Corporation decided to do.This decision, however, caused great discontent to the Allotment Association, who are arranging the cultivation of some 90 acres of alloHtf&amp;ts at Bristol, and they appealed to the Board to intervene&apos; on their behalf and arrange for the retention of the land for two years after the war.    The Association pointed cut the great efforts that had been necessary to bring this very rough land into temporary cultivation.On(s of the Board&apos;s Inspectors accordingly visited Bristol Y*d interviewed all the parties,, as a result of which it was Eventually arranged, to the satisfaction of all concerned, that the Association shall remain in possession until Michaelmas, 1920.
Chinnor Parish, (Private Allotment s) .   ..The attention of the Board Iwas drawn last year to a notice-to-quit expiring at Michaelmas, 1918, j which had &quot;been served by the owner on certain allotment-holders on 2 I acres of fruit-growing land in the Parish of Chinnor, Berksand-they arranged for an Inspector to enquire into the matter.    As a result of his intervention, the owner agreed to allow tho allotments to remain until the termination of the war.    The Board havo now been appealed to again by the&quot;allotment-holders, who state that&apos; they have received a ajcond notice to quit expiring at Michaelmas of this year.     The Board have caused further enquiries to be made in this case and it has now been.found possible to induce, the owner to allow the allotment-holders retain possession for a further term of 2 years from Michaelmas next,(iii) Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey.Up to the present 60% of the landowners who! have applied, a:J.nce the passing of tho Tithe   Act, 1918, for the redemption of tithe rentcharge have requested the Board to determine the amount of the compensation in accordance with the method prescribed by the. First Schedule to the Act, while the remaining 40% have agreed the. amount with the tithe-owners.    In cases where the Board have determined the amount&apos;, the average has been 18.48 years&apos; purchase of the par value of the tithe rentcharge in the case of clerical tithe rentcharge, as compared with&apos; 17.68 years&apos; purchase in the caBe of lay tithe rentcharge.    In , agreed cases the     tithe-owners have succeeded in obtaining for them- -7 selves more favourable terms, the average in,such cases being 19.58 years&apos; purchase for clerical tithe rc-ntcharge and 18.90 years&apos; purchase for lay tithe reritcharge.    In this connection, it is interesting to note&apos;that Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty before giving their consent to any agreement between an Incumbent and landowner for redemption at less than 20 years purchase, take steps to ascertain that the agreed amount Is not less than the amount calculated as prescribed by the First Schedule to the Act, but in cases where the amount is 20 years1 ;/ purchase or more they make no enquiry.Among the compulsory    -redemption cases in which the Board have determined objections during the past week is one affecting about 1,000 property owners in Eastbourne.    Of these, 65 lodged objections, chiefly on the ground that, as they were lessees only, they considered that the Duke of Devonshire, their lessor, should pay the shares of the cost of redemption assessed upon their properties.    His Grace, however, declined to accept any responsibility for such payment and his Solicitors furnished the Board with a copy of the covenant which -appears in all building leases granted in the locality by the Duke of Devonshire, and his predecessors in title, to the effect that the lessee should pay any principal sum which&apos;might, aftor tho date of the lease, become payable as the proportion to be charged upon the land in the event of the tithe rentcharge being   redeemed..    Even if there had been no such covenant -the Board would have been bound, under the Tithe Acts, to .. .   look to the lessees for payment of the assessments.    In all these cases tho Board determined adversely to the objections..The Hambledon (Surrey) Rural District. Council have revived a scheme which they had abandoned at. the beginning, of the War for. the regulation and management of certain Commons, comprising 120 acres of land in the Parish of Shalford, under the Commons Act, 1899,&apos; and they have now included in the scheine an additional common called Peas Marsh, having an area of about 40 acres.     The Board have addressed to the ... Council certain enquiries arising from their examination of the Scheme and the plan referring.thereto.
Commercial Division.Equipment o,jf Small Holdings.Appointment of,County Council Architects.    Approval has been given to the appointment of Architects by the Small Holdings Committees in Bucks; Flint, West,Sussex, Montgomery and Lindsey.    Gloucester.   The Small Holdings Committee of this County state that they are ready tb proceed with the equipment of a number of holdings and one of the (* Board1s District Architects has been lent to the Committee so as to enable them to pUsli on with the work.East: Riding.    tlans for additions and alterations to existing cottages at Babthorpe Farm, Hemingbrough, have been approved.West, Suffolk.    The question of erbcting cottages by direct labour^ is being Considered by this Committee, as it has not been found possible to obtain tenders1 from local builders.Farm Settlements *    Plans for cottages at Pembury and Heath Hill have been approved, and the Office o  Works has bben asked to obtain tenders for erection.Sulphate of Ammonia.At this beginning of June an arrangement-was made with makers whereby 5,000 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia at  17 tor ton were   to be reserved to meei immediate demands for this fertiliser for direct application.     this quantity has now-been sold.     The makers are now offering to supply any additional quantities at  19.10. per ton.Potash.The arrangements for the distribution or&quot; the potash imported from Germany in exchange for food have not been settled as the Board of Trade has not yet been able to come to a decision either in rOgard to the sale of the Government. Potash at a fixed price, or in regard to the limitation of imports from Alsace.    The representatives of the Alsaticn mines have offered through the Foreign Office to confer with a view to the Alsatian product being sold in such a way and in such quantities as will prevent undue competition between it and the Government-owned potash.    The fertiliser makers have been consulted provisionally and have been asked to state       what quantity of potash they expect to purchase.Feeding Stuffs.In view of the continuance of the Ministry of Food, it has been agreed that the Ministry should continue as the central authority for fbeding stuffs, subject to full consultation with the Board.    At a recfent Conference it was agreed that arrangements should if possible be made with oilcake makers and importers whereby an agreed selling price to the farmer should be established, such price to include delivery to farmer&apos;s nearest station on the lines adopted by this Board in the case of fertj  leers.    A uniform delivered price of this sort is the most effective method of preventing profiteering, and as it will be a voluntary price it is believed that it can be worked without interfering with importation by the private trader.&amp; According to latest reports the total supply of cileake this winter ought to be nearly up to pre-war levels, though  linseed cake will be short.    The demand for oil-cake, however, is very great owing to the insufficient supply of maize and other feeding stuffs.
Transport.At the request of the Department the Railway Executive Committee recently issued special instructions with regard to the treatment of fruit and vegetable empties with a view to preventing delays in transit.     For some little time past the handling of traffic in empties by tho Railways has not been satisfactory and has given rise to legitimate complaints, particularly in the case of some of the Northern Railways.     The representations made by the Board&apos;s officers to the Railway Companies have had a good effect, and whilst it is too much to say that the position is satisfactory, a substantial ^improvement has undoubtedly taken place.    &apos;Vnat is needed is the recognition of the principle that the transit of certain classes of food is dependent on the return of the empty packages and that these empties must therefore be dealt with as promptly as if they were full.The Table Rabbit Association has recently been pressing for the carriage of live rabbits at owner a1&apos; risk rates and state that this concession will do much to encourage the Marketing of live rabbits for the table.    The Railway Companies have now made the concession,Which in effect reduces the charges by about one-half.Inspection......of growing Crops of Se?d Potatoes.Applications have been received up to date for the inspection of a total area of 2,400 acres of crops of immune varieties of seed potatoes.     Official certificates will be issued in cases where the crops are found to be true to type and reasonably free from rogues.Technical and Cultivation Division.Tractor Section.During the week ended the 27th June, 1,272 tractors wererin the hands of Committees and 835 of these were being operated under the hew Tractor Scheme.     437 tractors were operated by Committees ,. directly, and of those 139 or i&apos;6% were in commission and were idle 9% of the time on account of bad weather;   248 were idle the whole week awaiting either repairs or contracts.In England and Wales 2,530 acres were ploughed and 3,206 acres cultivated by 476 tractors, giving an average of 5.32 and 6.74 acres respectively.The highest average acreage was again achieved in Lincoln (Kesteven) where 25 tractors ploughed 227-  acres and cultivated 273 acres, average 9,10 and&apos;10.92 acres respectively.&apos; Requirements jxndJDisnosal Section.During the weok ended July 12th, returns of sales have been forwarded by 3ast and &quot;Vest Sussex.

Tho Treasury have limited for the T?**ro**rfc the number of al 1 owanoee-ta, JJ350, pending evidence from th&amp;&apos; Board that there will be sufficient &apos; roimxiaoxaJtive ap^sU-nge in a^ri^ culture for farm trainees in exoese. of this numbed.     They&apos;&apos;have also asked that in future tho &apos;&amp;125 maintenance allowance&quot; should be regarded as a -maximum, instead of a flat rate.Negotiations on the above points are taking place with the Treasury, and in tho meanwhile all applications for further allowances (including correspondence) received by the Board are necessarily beins &quot;held up&quot;.&quot;Overseas&quot; Training.     The Treasury have authorised the grant of 50 allowances only, instead of 300 applied for, for officers who desire overseas training ^rith a view to settling abroad.&quot;Disabled&quot; Officers.     Tho Board have agreed to accept the res-ponsibility for the training of &quot;disabled&quot; officers in agriculture but a definite date for the transfer of these duties to the Board from the Ministry of Labour and Pensions has not yet   been decided upon.    It is expected that 1st October will be fixed, and in the meantime administrative machinery for the purpose will be set up.Training of Men .&quot;Disabled&quot; 1 Ion.

Representations havo been received from several AgriculturaY^xecutive Committees and also from Ministry of Labour Employment Exchange Committees that a period of from &quot;six to eight weeks&apos; training&quot;, as at present allowed, is insufficient to enable men to be placed out with farmers at the full agricultural wage. It is proposed to ask the Treasury to agree to the.present period of training being extended if necessary.Hen in Training at Centres.

The estimates *vq made ngninst pn imaginary standard crop for each variety cf 8 tons * 270 pots * 80C half-bushels from a plantation of 200 trees, 15 yoavs eld, per acre.ITo notice has been taken of the acreage under each variety or under Hums as a whole, for this could never be accurately ascertained, partly because Hum plantations nearly always contain other kinds of top fruit and also because eevnral varieties of plume arc generally interpreted together.    As the: acreage cannot be ascertained, it is not possible to show either the total plum production or the production for rn individual variety.The estimate diagram, nevertheless, gives a good idea of the intensity of yield for the various varieties for tho whole country, *;nd is especially interesting when compared with that pfcp.&apos;.red in 1918,Tho varieties Victoria Mnd Gear, which r re grown most generally through the whole of the country, - re expected to yield good crops, namely 5.22 tons and 4*12 tons per acre.    As these varieties produce the main bulk of the plum crop, the crop, considered     a whole, must prove a fairly good one.1&apos;orshore, a variety almost entirely confined to Vorcesterchiro and Herefordshire, estimated at 3.91 tons per acre, over 1 ton heavier per Acre than last year, when this variety cropped heavier than any other,Bl&apos;-&apos;ioden Rod a local plum grown in the Forest of Dean, :!leo promise well,, namely 4.3 tons, but Kentish Bush, which forms a large proportion of the Kentish Crop is poor, only, 2.73 tons.

They are not Offering rewards for carcases as they consider the responsibility of destroying the pests rests with the occupier whose premises are infected and who should pay for the service.     \tfhere an odcupier will not fall into line, the Committee propose to serve him with a notice as stated above and to charge him with the whole of the expenses as allowed under the rabies?ve Order.     Up to the present time the receipts of the Rat Catcher havo equalled the expenditure and therefore no actual cost has fallen upon the County Council.It is intended to deal with the whole of the County on this basis, taking various districts and working thorn right out. Several have already been visited and aro being dealt with.This is the first Local Authority to act upon our advice, viz, that the expenses&apos; incurred by the Local Authority should be mainly, if not entirely, defrayed b^r the persons on whose premises the rats are destroyed,     it is to be hoped that Herefordshire will develop their scheme and that the results will serve to encbufage other Local Authorities to follow their example,    Many thousands of rats havb been killed In various Cbunties under reward schemes but it is doubtful if the policy of letting the cost fall upon the general body of rate payers will be borne much longer without protest.The destruction df food by rats is to be the subject of discuesion at the next meeting of ihe Consumers1 Council,The following extract from a letter dated 11th July, from Dr, tfilloughby, iyiedical Officer of Health for the Port of London, will be of interest:-MIn view of the faot that sthere is a Bill dealing with rat destruction before the House, the following facts may be of interest to the Board.The 8,e, &quot;Aloinous&quot; was fumigated on the 2nd inst, under

The value of these nets is problematical and the cost of recovery might well outweigh their value.Demobilisation of lien.     Demobilisation of outstanding pivotal&apos;cases is proceeding slowly, so far as the Army ;s concerned, and new applications for release, on industrial grounds alone, are not entertained,Naval demobilisation is proceeding satisfactorily, A certain number of men are necessarily retained by the Navy by the delays in reconditioning demobilised fishing vessels0 About 1250 such vessels have now been released (or are about to be) at ports in England and Wales,
