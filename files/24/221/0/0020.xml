THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1931.SECRET. Copy No.     5CP. 120 (31).CABINET.THE IRISH FREE STATE AND APPEALS TO THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I DESIRE to call the attention of my colleagues to a difficult situation which has arisen in connexion with the question of Appeals from the Irish Free State to the Judicial Committee. The history of this question is summarised briefly in the following paragraphs : The Articles of Agreement of December 6, 1921.2. No specific reference is made to the Judicial Committee in the Articles of Agreement of 1921; but the representatives of the United Kingdom who signed the Agreement were satisfied that the prerogative right of the King, exercised by the Judicial Committee, to grant special leave to appeal was safeguarded by Article 2 of the Articles of Agreement. They assured the representatives of the Southern Unionists that this was the case; and a state-meni. to the same effect was made by Lord Curzon in the House of Lords.The Irish Free State Constitution.3. The Irish Free State Constitution as drafted in Dublin contained no reference to the question of appeals to the Judicial Committee. This was one of the points on which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom insisted that amendment would be necessary in order to bring the Constitution into harmony with the Articles of Agreement; and the Irish representative (Mr. Griffith) with some hesitation agreed. The express proviso which now appears in Article 66 of the Irish Free State Constitution was accordingly inserted and defended in the Irish Free State Parliament as a part of the &quot; bargain.&quot; Considerable emphasis was laid, in debates in the United Kingdom Parliament, on the importance of this right to grant special leave.Law Officers&apos; Opinion on the Position under the Articles of Agreement.4. In 1923 a question arose as to the powers of the Irish Free State Parliament to legislate with extra-territorial power, and the particular point arose whether, if express power were given to Canada to legislate with extra-territorial effect, a similar power would be conferred on the Irish Free State Parliament. The Law Officers first advised that the Irish Free State Parliament would also Have any such right that might be conferred on Canada; but subsequently altered their opinion to the effect that in law (i.e., apart from constitutional development) the rights conferred on the Irish Free State under the Articles of Agreement were those which Canada possessed in 1921 (a copy of the latter opinion is annexed as Appendix I).[5443] b
Lord IIaldane&apos;s Allocution.5. In 1923, when the first cases of applications for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State came before the Judicial Committee, Lord Haldane delivered an allocution on the principles by which the Judicial Committee would be guided in dealing with such applications. The relevant passages were quoted by Mr. 0&apos;Higgins in the Irish Free State Parliament in 1926. Very briefly, the effect was that the Judicial Committee would scrutinize very strictly the applications from the Irish Free State, and would to some extent be guided by the analogy of the Union of South Africa, from which, as a unitary state, appeals were very sparingly admitted.The Land Act Case before the Judicial Committee.6. At the end of 1925 the Judicial Committee granted special leave of appeal in two Irish Free State cases. The first of these (Lynham v. Butler) arose on a question of interpretation of the Irish Free State Land Act of 1923. The Irish Free State Government at once introduced legislation to settle the point which had arisen, and thereby to forestall any decision by the Judicial Committee on the point. This was done deliberately in order, inter alia, to indicate their view that this was not the sort of case in which the Judicial Committee was justified in granting special leave.Imperial Conference, 1926.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State brought up at the Imperial Conference of 1926 the question of the continuance of the right to grant special leave to appeal, urging that it was inconsistent with the existing constitutional position. In the brief prepared for United Kingdom Ministers on this question it was suggested that the United Kingdom attitude should be that it was too early yet for the Irish Free State to seek to vary an essential part of the compact of 1921. The discussions at the Conference showed that there was general agreement among the other Dominions that the question of abolishing the appeal by special leave was a matter which each Dominion ought to have the power to settle for itself; but the Irish Free State representatives were eventually induced to postpone their request for an immediate abolition of the right in their case.   (For the conclusions of the Conference see Appendix II.)Case of the. Transferred Civil Servants.8. As mentioned above, the Judicial Committee in 1925 gave special leave to appeal in a second case (Wigg and Cochrane v. the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State) arising out of the rights of transferred civil servants under Article X of the Articles of Agreement. The judgment of the Judicial Committee was delivered in 1927; but gave rise to difficulty since, apart from the fact that it placed an interpretation on Article X which was not that which it had been the intention of the parties to the agreement to place, it contained what was, on the face of it, a mis-statement of fact. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom proposed to introduce legislation concurrently with legislation in the Irish Free State to restore the original intention. The subject was discussed in the House of Lords, and in the course of the debate declarations were made by members of the Judicial Committee to the effect that the judgment was wrong. It was eventually decided to arrange for a reconsideration of the point at issue by means of a special reference to the Judicial Committee under the Act of 1833. The judgment of the Judicial Committee on the special reference, however, confirmed the interpretation which the previous judgment had placed on Article X. The Irish Free State declined to accept responsibility for the payment of the additional, compensation involved thereby, and it was eventually agreed that this additional expense should be borne by the United Kingdom. An agreement was made between the two Governments, and confirmed by legislation.
Copyright Case.9. The third (and only other) case occurred in 1928 in which special leave to appeal was granted by the Judicial Committee. This case (Performing Rights Society Limited v. Bray Urban District Council) raised the question whether the Copyright Act, 1911, remained in force in the Irish Pree State, under the terms pf the Irish Pree State Constitution. The Irish Pree State Supreme Court, reversing the decision of the Court of first instance, held that the Act did not continue. Before an appeal from the Supreme Court decision could be heard by the Judicial Committee, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Pree State introduced and secured the passing of legislation to restore the position by the preservation of existing copyrights which would otherwise have lapsed, but at the same time depriving the owners of such copyrights of any right to sue in respect of past infringements. The intention of this was to nullify in advance the appeal to the Judicial Committee. The Judicial Committee, on hearing the appeal, came to the conclusion that, as decided by the Court of first instance, the Act of 1911 continued in force, but, having regard to the provision in the legislation passed in the Irish Free State to remove the right to sue in respect of past infringements, they felt unable to restore in full the judgment of the Court of first instance, and they did not therefore do more than discharge the Order of the Supreme Court in so far as it directed payment of costs.Imperial Conference, 1930.10. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State had indicated by despatch before the Imperial Conference of 1930 their intention &quot;to make known to the delegates of His Majesty&apos;s other Governments their desire that the wishes of the majority of their people in the matter of applications for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee should be carried out.&quot; In framing their proposal in this manner it may have been intended to appeal to the first part of the declara-tion of the 1926 Conference, i.e., that &quot;it was no part of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain that questions affecting judicial appeals should be determined otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the part of the Empire primarily affected,&quot; and to secure the co-operation of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in removing the right of the Judicial Committee to grant special leave of appeal from the Irish Free State courts. In the course of discussion at the Conference, however, they took up a further position, namely, that it was within the constitutional rights of the Irish Free State not merely to have this right of granting special leave abolished with the co-operation of the United Kingdom, but to abolish it for themselves, without such co-operation. They based their argument on two &quot;alternative pleas&quot; : (a) that the right of granting special leave is not provided for in the Agreement of 1921; (b) that even if it were, the position has been so modified by the advance in constitutional status (marked, in particular, by the &quot; Balfour Declaration &quot; of the Imperial Conference of 1926 regarding autonomy), that the right of granting special leave could now be abolished without any breach of the Agreement of 1921.11. As has been stated above, the right of granting special leave is not expressly mentioned in the Agreement of 1921. It was regarded as covered by the clause which provided that the &quot;law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.&quot; As already indicated, the Irish Free State representatives at the time accepted (under pressure) this view, and accordingly agreed to insert into the Irish Free State Constitution a proviso safeguarding the &quot;right of any person to petition Plis Majesty for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council&quot; and &quot; the right of His Majesty to grant such leave.&quot; As an alternative argument, therefore, the Irish Free State representatives at the 1930 Conference developed the view that this article has a reference to &quot; status &quot; and that &quot; law, practice and constitutional usage &quot; was to be interpreted in the light of subsequent developments of &quot;Dominion status,&quot; especially, of course, the declarations of the Imperial Conference of 1926. Whatever, therefore, might have been the position in 1921, they held that constitutional usage in 1930 would mean, for example, that if Candida (and the [5443] b 2
other Dominions) wished to get rid of the right of granting special leave, it was within their &quot;constitutional right&quot; to do so, and presumably to obtain, if necessary, the co-operation of the United Kingdom Parliament for this &quot;purpose.12. It is clear that at the time of the Agreement of 1921 the Parliament of Canada had no right to abolish the right to grant special leave; and (as shown above) the United Kingdom Law Officers in 1923 advised, as a matter of Law, that the position of the Irish Free State under this article falls to be interpreted by the position of Canada in 1921, without reference to subsequent developments in the case of Canada.13. In the circumstances, the United Kingdom representatives at the 1930 Imperial Conference refused to admit that the Irish Free State had any constitutional right to abolish the right of granting special leave without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom Parliament; they refused to promise such concurrence on the part of the United Kingdom Government, and indicated their view that such concurrence could not be obtained from the United Kingdom Parliament. They expressed the view that, in the circumstances, attempt on the part of the Irish Free State to abolish the granting of special leave to appeal might be regarded as a breach of the Agreement of 1921; but, in order to settle this point, offered that the question should be referred to the new Commonwealth Tribunal, provision for which was included in the recommendations of the Conference or to any other acceptable form of arbitration. The Irish Free State representatives, in view of the vital importance which they attached to this question, declined to accept any form of arbitration; they indicated that they would find themselves compelled, in the absence of agreement, to take unilateral action to secure the discontinuance of appeals to the Judicial Committee.Informal Discussion subsequent to the Imperial Conference, 1930.14. In the course of informal discussions between officials of the Dominions Office and of the Irish Free State Department of External Affairs in March 1931, on the subject of a possible method of settlement by arbitration of the outstanding-dispute as to the boundary between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in the Lough Foyle area, the Secretary to the Irish Free State Department of External Affairs intimated that it was contemplated that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the Irish Free State would shortly introduce into their Parliament a Bill making statutory the final decisions of the Free State Supreme Court, and perhaps also eliminating the proviso to Article 66 of the Constitution, and indicated the possibility that this Bill would go through the Free State Parliament without any objections being raised to its passage by the Southern Unionist deputies and senators.15. It appears to me that, if there were adequate evidence that there was no longer a general desire amongst the Southern Unionists that the right of appeal should be retained, the situation would be changed, and the way might be open for an agreed settlement of the question. With the Prime Ministers authority, therefore, I caused an intimation on these lines to be conveyed informally to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, indicating at the same time that the possibility of a settlement would be easier if it were possible at the same time to deal with the question of Lough Foyle and also with certain other outstanding administrative questions between the Free State and ourselves.Discussion with Mr. McGilligan.16. I took the opportunity of a visit paid to London by Mr. McGilligan on other matters to discuss this question with him; I attach (Appendix III) a note of my conversation with him on the 19th March.Further Discussions between Officials.17. Subsequent to that discussion, meetings between officials were resumed and considerable progress was made as to the basis of an agreement on the various outstanding administrative questions   In the course of these meetings my Legal
Adviser discussed with the Legal Adviser of the Irish Free State Department of External Affairs, upon the basis that an agreement on the subject of the Judicial Committee might be possible, the form which that agreement might take, and put forward tentatively a clause on the following lines : &quot; It is hereby agreed that articles 2 and 3 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, dated the 6th day of December, 1921, are to be construed so that, in the references therein to the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the position of the Dominion of Canada, the position of the Dominion of Canada means the position of that Dominion existing from time to time.&quot;18.   The effect of this would be that (1) The Irish Free State would acquire the moral right to abolish the appeal, since the express purpose of the Agreement would be to enable the Irish Free State to have the same right as Canada to deal with the question of appeals.(2) The constitutional right of the Irish Free State in relation to the abolition of the appeal would be the same as that of other Dominions.(3) The Irish Free State would (with Canada) acquire the legal right to abolish the appeal as soon as the Statute of Westminster came into force.19. The Irish Free State Legal Adviser demurred to this proposal upon the grounds that it did not abolish the appeal in terms, and, in any case, it would not enable the Irish Free State to secure the immediate abolition of the appeal.Correspondence with Mr. McGilligan.20. In the circumstances I thought it desirable to endeavour to clear up the position by writing to Mr. McGilligan. A copy of my letter is attached as Appendix V.21. To this letter I received a most unsatisfactory reply (Appendix VI), and I accordingly sent a further letter (Appendix VII), indicating that I was submitting the whole position to the Cabinet Mr. McGilligan replied in the telegram (which forms Appendix VIII), saying that my letter left &quot; no avenue open for successful discussion.&quot;Future Procedure.22. It seems clear that there is now no prospect of our being able to reach a satisfactory agreement on the subject, and we must, therefore, consider what our next step should be.23. I have not seen the draft of the Bill which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State propose to introduce, and the suggested course of action indicated below may, of course, require modification in the light of the terms of the Bill if published before there is time for action on our part to be taken.24. Subject to this point, it appears to me that we ought at once to define and make clear to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State our attitude in the event of their proceeding with the contemplated legislation. If the Cabinet approve, I would propose that a communication should be made to the Free State Government, through some suitable channel, on the following lines, in which, I understand, from the legal aspect the Attorney-General concurs : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State will, of course, realise that, in the event of legislation designed to effect the abolition of the appeal to the Judicial Committee being introduced into the Irish Free State Parliament, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will inevitably be called upon to define in Parliament here their attitude in the matter.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom think it right, therefore, to let His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State know
that their attitude has always been that the formal recognition in the Irish Free State Constitution that &apos; nothing therein shall impair the right of any person to petition His Majesty for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council or the right of His Majesty to grant such leave,&apos; gave effect to what was accepted on both sides as an integral part of the settlement concluded between the two countries in December 1921.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom appreciate, of course, that, since 1921, there have been considerable developments in the constitutional position of the Dominions, but throughout the course of these developments the question of appeals to the Judicial Committee from the Irish Free State has been regarded as standing on a special footing and as requiring separate consideration by the parties directly affected.&quot; Therefore, apart from any question whether legislation of the kind involved would be valid, or what would be its legal effect, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom could not regard separate action by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State designed to bring about the abolition of the appeal, if taken without their assent, as compatible with the obligations assumed by the Irish signatories to the &apos; Articles of Agreement&quot; for a Treaty &apos; of 1921.&quot;Dominions Office, May 1931.
APPENDIX I.Law Officers&apos; Opinion, December 31, 1923.Constitutional Relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State.Colonial Office to Law Officers.Gentlemen, downing  Street, November 13, 1923.I AM directed by the Duke of Devonshire to refer to the letter from this Department of the 29th June last and your Report of the 21st July last, with reference to the extra-territorial effect of certain Imperial Statutes in their present application to the Irish Free State, in paragraph 5 of which Report you expressed the view that, if the proposal to confer power on the Canadian Parlia-ment to legislate with extra-territorial effect were carried out, the Irish Free State, since its position under the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland (which may for convenience be called the Treaty) is that of the Dominion of Canada, would be entitled to claim that it had the same power.I am to say that the question which was raised by implication in paragraph 7 of the Reference from this Department of the 29th June, and which the Secretary of State would now desire to put in an express form, is whether under Article 2 of the Treaty the constitutional position of the Irish Free State is to be that of Canada at the date when the Treaty was signed (6th December, 1921) or whether the constitutional relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State are to be affected legally and constitutionally by every change taking place after that date in the constitutional relations between the United Kingdom and Canada.I am to explain that His Grace is informed that at the time when the negotiations for the Treaty were being carried on it was a fundamental part of the intended settlement that the constitutional relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State should be those actually at that time existing between the United Kingdom and Canada.It was for this reason, to give one illustration, that with the concurrence of Lord Hewart (then Attorney-General) the British delegates did not press for any provision in the Treaty as to appeals to the Privy Council, since in Lord Hewart&apos;s opinion there was no doubt that the then existing position as to appeals from Canada to the Privy Council would be maintained with regard to the Irish Free State, even if appeal to the Privy Council from Canada should at any future time be abolished.It is true that this particular point does not arise on the construction of Article 2 of the Treaty, since the prerogative of the Crown to grant special leave to appeal to the Privy Council has been expressly provided by the proviso to Article 66 of the Irish Free State Constitution, but the question of construction does arise Avith regard to the proposed extension of the power of the Canadian Parliament and may arise from time to time with other changes in the constitutional relations between the United Kingdom and Canada.It is, therefore, one of the greatest possible importance, and I am directed by the Secretary of State to request you to take the construction of the Treaty again into your consideration, and to report whether, on such further consideration, you are able to modify the opinion expressed in paragraph 5 of your Report of the 21st July.I am, &amp;c.J. E. MASTERTON SMITH.
Opinion.We have taken the matter into our consideration and in obedience to Your Grace&apos;s commands have the honour to report:  The question raised in the letter of the 13th November is one of great constitutional importance and also one of considerable difficulty.We have, however, come to the conclusion after carefully considering the problem that the view expressed by Lord Hewart is the true one and that the opinion expressed in paragraph 5 of our Report of the 21st July should be altered accordingly.The relevant words occur in Article 2 of the Treaty that &apos;&apos; the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown, or the representative of the Crown, and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.&quot; It is of the essence of the British Constitution that the practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of Great Britain to the self-governing Dominions are growing and developing from year to year; and at first sight it seems very startling to hold that in the case of Southern Ireland the practice and constitutional usage are stereotyped as if existing on a particular date, while with the rest of the Empire they are constantly altering.We think, however, that the answer to this difficulty is to be found in the reflection that, although the Treaty gives to Southern Ireland the practice and constitutional usage as existing between Great Britain and Canada at the date of the Treaty, there is nothing to prevent the development from time to time of that practice and constitutional usage in the same way as it has developed in the past, and will no doubt develop in the future, between Great Britain and the other self-governing Dominions.The contrary view as to the construction of the Article would involve the difficulty that in theory at least Canada might hereafter surrender some of her present rights of self-government, and that it is very improbable that Southern Ireland can have agreed that her rights should depend upon arrangements made in the future between Great Britain and Canada with regard to which she might not be consulted at all.We have, &amp;c.DOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG. T. W. H. INSKIP.Law Officers&apos; Department. December 31, 1923.APPENDIX II.Extract from Summary of Proceedings of Imperial Conference, 1926.(e) Appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.ANOTHER matter which we discussed, in which a general constitutional principle was raised, concerned the conditions governing appeals from judgments in the Dominions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. From these discussions it became clear that it was no part of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain that questions affecting judicial appeals should be determined&apos; otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the part of the Empire primarily affected. It was, however, generally recognised that, where changes in the existing system were proposed which, while primarily affecting one part, raised issues in which other parts were also concerned, such changes ought only to be carried out after consultation and discussion.So far as the work of the Committee was concerned, this general understand-ing expressed all that was required. The question of some immediate change in the present conditions governing appeals from the Irish Free State was not pressed in relation to the present Conference, though it was made clear that the right was reserved to bring up the matter again at the next Imperial Conference for discussion in relation to the facts of this particular case.
APPENDIX III.Note of Discussion between Mr. Thomas (Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs) and Mr. McGilligan (Minister for External Affairs, Irish Free State) on March 19, 1931.Judicial Committee.THE Secretary of State had an interview with Mr. McGilligan in his room at the House of Commons yesterday, the two Ministers alone being present, and had a long discussion with him, Mr. Thomas basing his arguments on the general lines of the memorandum attached.*Mr. McGilligan expressed himself desirous of reaching a settlement by bilateral agreement if this was in any way possible, and, if there were any prospect of this, was prepared to hold up the Bill which otherwise he proposed to submit to the Dail very shortly. He confirmed what Mr. Walshe had said as to the attitude of the Southern Unionists, and undertook to consider in what way it would be possible to produce evidence of such a change of attitude on their part. He thought that the method of proceeding by Resolution in the Dail presented political difficulties because the Free State Government were committed to introducing a Bill, and the Republican party would ask why they were now drawing back.During the discussion Mr. McGilligan again put forward the legal arguments on -account of which the Free State Government held that the abolition of the appeal would not be a breach of the Treaty, but Mr. Thomas made it clear that he was not there to discuss the legal side of the question, but to consider whether there was a practical way round the political difficulties involved.Mr. Thomas made it clear that the political difficulties in this country were great, and he wanted some evidence of a new situation in Ireland which would render it possible to make an approach to the leaders of the Opposition parties in this country with a prospect of success.Mr. McGilligan was entirely in favour of an attempt to reach a comprehensive agreement of all outstanding questions by consent and good will, and appreciated that such a general settlement would render easier the settlement of the particular question of the Judicial Committee.With regard to the various questions mentioned by Mr. Thomas : Great Seal.- The Great Seal had been happily settled that morning by Mr. McGilligan&apos;s audience of the King, at which His Majesty had approved, the proposals which the Irish Free State Government had submitted after conferring with the United Kingdom Government.Lough Foyle. Mr. McGilligan agreed that the only permanent solution would be found by means of a reference of the matter to arbitration under the machinery of the Commonwealth Tribunal, but he thought it possible that some administrative interim arrangement might be found, especially if negotiations for a general cleaning of the slate were taking place.Irish Lights. Mr. McGilligan said that he had reached an agreement satis-factory to the Free State with the then President of the Board of Trade in 1929, and he did not understand why the proposals had been withdrawn. He was anxious for a settlement of this question, and thought that it ought to be possible to find the basis for one without great difficulty.Other outstanding administrative questions. Mr. McGilligan expressed himself as ready to have an examination of such questions as Execution of Warrants, and Lunatics&apos; Estates, made at once, with a view to seeing whether a settlement of all&apos; these questions by reciprocal arrangements could not be arrived at.With regard to the effect which a non-settlement by agreement of the Judicial Committee question might have on the Statute of Westminster, Mr. McGilligan said that he had been assured by Mr. Bennett that the Free State* Appendix IV.[5443] c
would have the support of all members of the Commonwealth if the House of Lords were to attempt to tack on to the Statute of Westminster a provision saving the right of appeal in the Free State.It was left that Mr. McGilligan would report to the Executive Council in the Free State his conversation with Mr. Thomas, and that he would then communicate further with the Secretary of State as soon as the Executive Council had had time to consider the whole matter.If the Free State Government were ready to begin negotiating for a compre-hensive settlement on the lines Mr. Thomas had suggested, probably the first step would be for the Free State Government to send two or three representatives to London to begin negotiating here. Later, say in a month &apos;s time, Mr. Thomas expressed himself as ready to go to Dublin to continue the negotiations there if the prospect of reaching agreement would thereby be helped.Dominions Office, March 20, 1931.APPENDIX IV.Memorandum prepared, for Use as a Basis of Discussion with Mr. McGilligan(Irish Free State).IF the information is correct that the Southern Unionists, so far from voting against the Bill to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee when it appears in the Dail, will none of them oppose the Bill and several of them actively support it, a new situation would seem to be created.Is it not possible for evidence of such a change of attitude to be furnished before the Bill is introduced ?When once the Bill is introduced the Government here would be bound to oppose it on the ground that it amounted to a breach of the bargain between the two countries.If, however, it could be shown by means of a resolution in the Dail or otherwise that the Southern Unionists no longer desire the retention of the appeal and above all, if the Southern Unionists would take steps to make their position clear to their friends in this country, the prospects of getting a settlement by agreement through Parliament here would be greatly improved.Prospects also would no doubt be improved if the Judicial Committee settle-ment could be made part of a larger whole. And this leads ori to the question  if we have reached a settlement by goodwill of the Great Seal question and if we can see our way to a settlement of the Lough Foyle question, can we not have a general cleaning of the slate, of which a settlement of the Judicial Committee by agreement could form part?Questions which might be included in a general agreement are as follows : (1) Great Seal. Inasmuch as under the new procedure the representative of the Crown in Ireland will presumably be appointed in future in a. different manner from the Governor-General of Canada (in whose case the existing Seals have been employed) it is possible to argue that the new procedure amounts to an alteration of the Articles of Agreement which could properly be inserted in a general agreement to be afterwards ratified by legislation in both countries.(2) Lough Foyle. Provided agreement on the Judicial Committee can be reached, it is understood that the Free State Government would be prepared to agree that outstanding differences between the two Governments with regard to Lough Foyle should be referred to the Commonwealth Court.(3) Appeals to the Judicial Committee.(4) Irish Lights. At the beginning of March a proposal was made to the Irish Free State Government (following upon several years of negotiations) that the question of the administration of the Irish Lights should be settled on the basis of their division between an authority controlling the lighthouses in the Irish Free State and an authority controlling the lighthouses in Northern
APPENDIX V.Secret and Personal.My dear McGilligan, Downing Street, May 1, 1931.I AM glad to hear that considerable progress has been made by the officials on both sides during the meetings of the last few days in regard to the outstanding administrative questions, and that provisional agreement now appears in sight upon all of them including Irish Lights. There now only remains the big ; question of the Judicial Committee;1 and&apos;the smaller but difficult question of Lough Foyle.As regards the Judicial Committee, may I set out very briefly our respective points of view as they appear to me ?From your point of view, you want to be able to inform your Parliament that you are going to get rid of the appeal; while you are advised that you could in practice achieve your object by unilateral action, you would prefer to proceed by[5443] dIreland, and that, as the - allocation of the lights at the entrance to Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough had hitherto proved an obstacle to a -settlement on these lines, an allocation of these particular lights proposed by one of the professional officers of the Board of Trade should be adopted without prejudice.to; the/future settlement of the boundary question in the two Loughs.    .It would be very useful if agreement in principle could be reached on this long-outstanding matter in connexion with the proposed, general settlement,both as regards the particular question of the division of the. lights in iLough Loyle, and Carlingford Lough and the whole question of the transfer of the lighthouse service in the Irish Free State area to the Irish Free State Government (it would hot necessarily be the most convenient arrangement that the division of the lights; should follow the boundary line when determined).(5) Outstanding administrative questions with regard to such matters as execution of Warrants and lunatics&apos; estates. There are various questions of this nature which have been outstanding for a long time, and on which it might be possible to reach agreement in principle in a general atmosphere of goodwill.If we were able to get all these questions settled we should really have got rid of all outstanding questions of importance, and should have accomplished something which ought to make for better relations between the two countries for the future.All this presupposes the settlement of the Judicial Committee question by agreement, and that the Free State will abandon any idea of settling it by unilateral action such as by passing a Bill declaring that the judgments of the Supreme Court in all cases shall have the force of statutory law thereby leaving the right of appeal but rendering it nugatory. Such a Bill, even if it enabled the Free State Government to effect their purpose without infringing the Articles of Agreement, would no doubt cause as much outcry as a Bill expressly taking a,way the right of appeal, and would ruin the chance of settlement by agreement, either of this or of other outstanding matters.If it were possible for the Free State Government to agree to refer all questions with regard to the interpretation of the Articles of Agreement to arbitration under the machinery of the new Commonwealth Tribunal, it would, no doubt, be a strong argument, for Parliamentary purposes here, in favour of acquiescence in the abolition of the right of appeal. The difficulties are appreciated, but it might be possible to find some formula to which both sides could agree as part of the larger agreement contemplated above.One last consideration. It is impossible not to foresee the risk that, if the Statute of Westminster is introduced without an agreement with regard to the Judicial Committee, Parliament here may (and if a Bill has been introduced or passed in the Free State Parliament affecting such appeals probably will) insist on the insertion of a clause comparable to that already contemplated (see page 20 of Cmd. 3717) as to the Constitution of Australia and New Zealand to the effect that nothing in the Statute shall be deemed to give the Irish Free State the right to alter the Constitution in any way repugnant to the Articles of Agreement.Dominions Office, March 18, 1931.
agreement which would not only clear up the whole question, but would also avoid the possibility of any allegation being made of bad faith.My point of view is that the proper way to proceed is by agreement, and, in the interests of good relations between the two countries, I am anxious to see whether an agreement can be reached. If, as I understand, you expect to be in a position to produce satisfactory evidence of a change of attitude on the part of the Southern Unionists (and I would emphasise the immense importance of our having such evidence, without which I could not possibly go on), I feel that it ought not to be impossible to arrive at an agreement though you will appreciate that for me it is essential that it should be in a form which offered reasonable prospect of my being able to get it through Parliament.There appear to be, in principle, two possible courses : (a) An agreement scheduled to an Act of Parliament which would in termsabolish the appeal;(b) An agreement scheduled to an Act of Parliament which would placebeyond doubt the constitutional right of the Pree State, in common with the other Dominions, to deal with the question of appeals to the Judicial Committee in accordance with its desire..I ought to make it clear at once that, for political reasons here, the first course would be quite impracticable for me. It would be hopeless for me to ask Parliament to take upon itself the responsibility for the abolition of the appeal.I could not do more than ask Parliament to place the Pree State in a position which would enable it to adopt whatever course it desired; but would it not be possible to find a formula which would place the Free State in that position 1I understand that there may be a doubt as to the legal effect of action by the Free State in pursuance of such an agreement, if taken before the Statute of Westminster becomes law; and I appreciate that, if you felt that any risk would arise out of this and did not wish to take it, it would involve your waiting until December. Even so, it would have been established here and now that the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the appeal was identical with that of Canada, morally, constitutionally and legally. Believe me, it would be quite useless for me to place before Parliament an agreement which did more than this; but an agreement which did this, if we could reach it, would surely be more than worth while, for it would settle with good will a question long outstanding, and moreover, from your point of view, with the result that you wrant to achieve.I realise your political difficulties, but I do hope that you will appreciate that mine are no less.As to Lough Foyle, I am looking into the matter further in the light of the discussion which took place between the officials. This, as well as the Judicial Committee, raises political questions which must be settled between Ministers.As I explained to you when you were here, I am very ready to come to Dublin to discuss matters further with Cosgrave and you, provided I can see a fair prospect of our being able to reach a settlement; but I think that before I pay a visit to Dublin, with the inevitable publicity which would result, we ought to get the issues further defined.Would not the best plan be for us to have another private talk when you&apos; are coming through London on your way to Geneva which, I imagine, will be about the 12th May ? This would have the advantage of avoiding publicity, and would give me time to look further into the question of Lough Foyle. It would also be helpful to me if you could then let me have an indication as to the attitude of the Southern Unionists, to which I have referred above.I would only add this. As I think that you and Cosgrave know, I am genuinely anxious to reach a settlement of these questions which have been outstanding for so long. I believe that, as between two Members of the British Commonwealth, such questions ought not to be outstanding, and that their settlement by consent and goodwill is bound to have a beneficial influence on the relations between the two countries.Yours sincerely, (Signed) J. PL THOMAS.
APPENDIX VI.(Secret and Personal.) Department of External Affairs,My dear Thomas, Irish Free State, May 6, 1931.THANK you for your letter of the 1st instant. I wish I could agree that considerable progress had been made in the discussions you refer to. But the reports made to me of those discussions do not warrant that satisfying assumption. On one point only was any advance made-on the minor administrative matters-and an agreement on this never presented any serious difficulty. The introduction of a proposal concerning paupers could only constitute an element of disagree-ment. The suggested solution of the Irish Lights situation in some respects is no better than that of the autumn of 1929, in others it is actually worse..In regard to Lough Foyle, no very serious trouble has yet arisen, but the failure of the Society to get its rights recognised in our Courts indicates a feeling of doubt as to their legal basis, and if the fishermen on our side regard the attitude of the Society as giving them a presumptive right to fish, I do not see how we can act against them. The admitted fact of our ownership of at least some part of the Lough strengthens the impression that the Society has no confidence in its claims. We must become progressively less active against the so-called &quot; poachers &quot; as time goes on. I am nearly at the point of having to state in the Dail that, on the whole, the fishermen have at least as good a right as the Society or its lessees in the Lough.An agreement which was not opposed to the Constitutional position might be the most satisfactory method of dealing with the Privy Council, but on reading your letter I have been forced to the conclusion that no formula satisfactory to us can be found within the limitations which you say your Parliamentary situation imposes on you. My own method of dealing with the Privy Council still remains open to me, and I do not see that any other method is left. I had the legislation which I require in an advanced stage of preparation, and simply postponed the finishing touches because you requested consideration of an agreed solution. Time is, however, of the essence of this problem for us, as we must have the legislation on the Statute Book before we rise for the summer recess, and the fruitless search for an agreement has not merely lost us valuable weeks, but has also led to Press articles here and Parliamentary questions with you which are certainly based on the knowledge that conversations are proceeding, are well enough informed to be able to appreciate the points raised on your side and have for their object to defeat the will of the people of this country on this matter. I am, therefore, having the legislation finally decided upon, so that the first reading of it can be taken while I am away, in preparation for the second stage immediately I return.In these circumstances, I cannot see much good resulting from another meeting between us. I do cross to England on Sunday night, arriving in London on the morning of Monday, the 11th May. It had been my intention to go straight through to Paris, and, while I could delay until the afternoon train, I am so rushed and have so much preliminary work to attend to in Geneva that I would stop over until the afternoon only if I had an expression of opinion from you that you had in your mind a formula, suitable to your own State and satisfactory to us, on which an agreement could be framed so speedily that I could lay it before my Parliament in the second week of June-the date on which I now propose to take the second reading of my Bill.Yours sincerely, (Signed)        P. McGILLIGAN.The Right Honourable J. H. Thomas, P.C.
APPENDIX VII.Secret and Personal. Dominions Office, Downing Street,Dear McGilligan, May 8, 1931.I ONLY received your letter of the 6th May this mprning on my return from Bradford, and I am bound to say that I read it with much regret. You do not say why you consider that no mutually satisfactory formula in regard tp the judicial Committee can be found, or what objection you feel to the possible course of action which I outlined in my letter of the 1st May. In the absence of this information, and of any reference in your letter to evidence of a change of attitude on the part of the Southern Irish Unionists, without which, as I have always made clear, we could not go on, I am not in a position to attempt to find such a formula as you indicate at the end of your letter. I must therefore now put the whole position to the Cabinet here, and this will be done next week.I have to be in Manchester on Sunday night, so that I could not possibly see you here before the 11 o&apos;clock train for Paris leaves on Monday, but I shall be back at the Dominions Office by noon, and would make arrangements to be free between then and the time of the afternoon train to Paris. I feel, in all the circumstances, that I must leave it to you to decide whether you would like to see me then, and I shall be grateful if you will wire to me to-morrow to let me know.Yours sincerely, (Signed) J. H. THOMAS.P. McGilligan, Esq., T.D.APPENDIX VIII.Telegram from the Minister for External Affairs, Irish Free State, to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 9th May, 1931.(Received in the Dominions Office at 2-30 P.M., 9th May, 1931.)Private and Personal.FOLLOWING for Thomas from McGilliganBegins: Your letter of the 1st May leaves no avenue open for successful discussion. In the circumstances, you will agree that no useful purpose could be served by having a meeting on Monday.  Ends.
