48THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVETOTIjENT.p..P.-150i3ll.. COPY NO. . j.....SECRET. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL.BORROWING AND TRANSITIONAL BENEFIT.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.It is necessary to pass into law by 8th July a Bill extending the borrowing powers of the Unemployment Fund. I propose an extension of  25 millions, making the total  115 millions.       20 millions would be sufficient to carry us over till the beginning of November if we borrow no more than  1,000,000 a week as has been the case recently, but we cannojt be sure of this and it is necessary to have -a margin to ensure that the Fund will not be short of money before legislation can be obtained after the Recess.It is also necessary to decide whether the same Bill should deal with either or both of the following points:-(l)    extension of transitional period;(2)    any recommendations of the Royal Commission as to anomalies which are to be adopted.In the- present state of the Parliamentary time-table,  it seems clear that the Royal Commission recommendations should not be included in this Bill.      If they were Included, more time would be needed in the Commons,  and the Bill would probably not be certified to be a Money Bill.      It would be essential, however,  that in moving the financial resolution for the Bill,  I should be in a position to amoimoc- in detail^our intentions as regards the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendations.Legislation extending the transitional period must come into force by October,  that is,  it must be passed before
490the end of the present Session.The extension should presumably he for a further six months.      It would he convenient to include it in the Bill dealing with &quot;borrowing and so get it out of the way.; hut if we do this we may meet with serious objection. We could not represent that the extension of the transitional period must become law before 8th July.      I may mention also that the handling of a Bill dealing with anomalies would be easier if it included the extension of the transitional period.      On the other hand,   it has to be remembered that if we adopt this alternative,  the second Bill would have to be put through at all costs before the end of this Session.(Intd.)    M.G.B.9th June,  1931.
