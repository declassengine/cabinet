SECRET.CP.  147 (311. COPY no.    $185MEMORMDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs for THE CABINET.5?ie-.question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government, should particlpato in the proceedings &quot;before The Hague Court regarding the validity of the proposed Austro--GermanCustoms Union.In my note of the 2nd instant, which was considered at the last Cabinet, I explained the action which had been taken at recent meetings at Geneva with a view to solving the problem which the proposal for an Austro-German Customs Union has created.     It will he recollected that it was at my instance that the question of this Customs Union was originally placed on the agenda of the recent League Council, and that the League Council subsequently adopted the unanimous decision to invite the Permanent Court of International Justice to give an advisory opinion on the legal question whether the proposed Union infringed the Treaty of St. Germain and the Protocol of 1922.     In explaining my action to the Council I made the following statement:-&quot;The decision which I shall invite the Council to &quot;take seems to me all the more necessary, in view of the &quot;immediate effect created by the publication of the terms &quot;of the new Protocol.     Soon after the terms of the &quot;Protocol were publicly announced, I was in Paris attending&quot;the ..
p I0!2.&quot;the Committee appointed by the Commission of Enquiry on &quot;European Unien, and I soen found evidence ef the appre-&quot;hensiens which had &quot;been aroused.     Prom contact with some &quot;ef my colleagues, I found that there were real misgivings &quot;that this project, if realised, might be contrary to the &quot;stipulations of certain international instruments.     The &quot;compatibility of the project with international ebiiga-&quot;tions appeared to me ts involve the consideration of &quot;purely juridical problems, for the solution of which a &quot;system of procedure had &quot;been provided by the League of &quot;Natiens.&quot;I therefore deemed it my duty, not only as &quot;representative of my Government, but also jLn my capacity &quot;erf Acting President of the Council, to give notice to the &quot;Secretary-General that the Council, under whose auspicesI &quot;the Protocol ef 1922 had been negotiated, should take/ _-_____....... _-__-&quot;these juridical problems into^censideratien at the first &quot;convenient opportunity.     In my view, the issue raises &quot;important economic and even political questions;   &quot;out &quot;tho aspect of the cast; with which we as a Council are &quot;concerned this morning is essentially one ef a juridical &quot;nature, and it is therefore eminently ene on which it&quot;would be desirable for the Council to request an &quot;advisory opinion frem the Permanent Court of Inter-&apos;natitnal Justice.     To follow any other course would mean &quot;protracted discussion in this Council, and, of necessity, &quot;a careful examination ef the legal instruments bearing &quot;upen the issue which has been raised, and, in the end, a &quot;possible failure to reach a conclusion.&quot;Such ...
467Such are the circumstances in which I came to take the initiative in this matter.     The resolution of the Council having been notified to The Hague Court, the Registrar of the Court has now notified Germany and Austria and all the signatories of the Treaty of St. Germain and of the Protocol of 1S22 that they are entitled to present their observations to the Court both in writing and orally. The question therefore arises whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should participate in these proceedings.     A decision on this.point is somewhat urgent inasmuch as the Court.has fixed the 1st July as the time limit within which the written statements must be submitted.     I would have preferred that documents such as the Protocol of 1922 and the Treaty of St. Germain had been submitted to the Court without pleading   but I em informed that this is not in accordance with the established procedure of the Court,While at Geneva M. Briand asked me whether it would be possible for the British and French Governments to sub-mit a joint case.     While warning M. Briand that the opinion which I had received from the Law Officers was far from being as definite as that which had been expressed by the French legal advisers, I promised him that after con-suiting the Attorney-General further on the matter I would let him know as soon as possible the line that His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to take.     The Attorney-General has now informed me that the case which he is prepared to. put forward would be on the lines of his official ...
official opinion of the 3let March (copy attached,);-  that this case cannot be regarded as identical with the French-case, and that for this reason he does not consider it possible for us to make common cause with the French Government in these proceedings.The idea of our co-operating in the presentation of a joint case, either with the French or with any other of the interested Governments, is thus seemingly excluded, and I have already informed the French Ambassador that such presentation would therefore hardly appear feasible.There now remains the further question of whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should participate independently in the proceedings &quot;before The Hague Court.     There are strong arguments both for and against such action on our. part, and I think it would be best if I state, for the benefit ef my colleagues, the principal arguments on both sides.The arguments in favour of participation may be sum-mar i zed as follows:-1.     As I took the initiative throughout at Geneva in bringing this question before The Hague Court, it will be expected that His Majesty!s Government should state their views to the Court.     We are parties to both the international instruments which the Court has to consider (the Treaty of St. Germain and the Geneva Protocol) and cannot be disinterested in the question of the proper interpretation of these instruments;   it is, therefore, natural that we should put before the Court our views onthese . ,.
409these points, and indeed it would he unnatural if we did not do so.2.     Although there is. no danger of the case against the Union going by default by our abstaining since it will be adequately stated by the French and Czechoslovak Govern-ments, nevertheless a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a somewhat intermediate case might assist the Court in deciding between the two extreme views.3.     It is both unnecessary and undesirable to treat this matter as a dispute between Germany and France and to abstain on that account from participation.     Inasmuch as the decision to refer this question to The Hague was adopted unanimously by the Council, we are justified in treating the matter as a friendly and preliminary agreement between all. the interested parties that the legal question should be cleared out of the way before they proceed with the real task of solving the economic problems of Austria and Europe generally, by elaborating some scheme of European economic co-operation with Germany and Austria would be able to accept as an adequate substitute for the Customs Union.     Germany should not therefore take offence if we participate in the legal discussions at The Hague, any more than she should resent our participation in the economic discussions in the sub-committees which have been specially set up at Geneva by the Commission on European Union.4.     Looked at from the general political point of view, it may be argued that the establishment of the proposed Customs Union would compromise the whole future ofEuropean ...
European co-operation, and should on this ground be prevented.     I have indeed spoken in this sense to the German Ambassador.     We ought, therefore, to avail our-selves of every permissible means of preventing the realisation of this Union, and ought to have the courage to state our views at every stage, including the present legal stage.5.     If after refusing to collaborate with the French Government in putting forward a joint case we now decide to abstain altogether, the French Government will consider that we have left them in the lurch, with the result that they may be more difficult to control in subsequent stages of this dispute.     For instance, the French press will certainly attribute our abstention to the influence brought, to bear on us by the German Chancellor at Chequers. Recriminations from the French must be faced when our views have nothing in common, as will often happen.   When they do, as in the present case, coincide to some extent, such recriminations had best be avoided.     In our dealings with the French we ought always to take a long view, aiming at eventual Treaty revision.     We will never get this if we have more squabbles with the French than is absolutely necessary.6.     The fact that during the legal stage of the proceedings we have advanced certain purely legal argu-ments in opposition to the Union need not prevent us in a subsequent political stage exercising our role of impartial mediator.     In fact it might indeed strengthen our hands in certain circumstances.
4717.     After all the publicity which has been given to this question,, the British public will expect His Majesty&apos; Government to have a definite view on the legal aspect of the dispute.     There might be criticisms if we merely subscribed to the French case, but there is no question of this since the idea of a joint case with the French has been ruled out.8.     It might be open to criticism if we were to app e ar a.i one with the French at The Hague;   but this will be avoided if, as I hope, we can persuade all the signa-tories of the 1922 Protocol to appear at The Hague.     Both the Italian and Belgian Governments are signatories and have already enquired what line His Majesty&apos;s Government are going to take.     They will probably both do whatever we da.The arguments against participation can be surn-marized as follows:-1.     As I explained in my speech to the Council, I only made my proposals in order to ensure that the legal dispute which has arisen between Germany and France should be dealt with in the proper quarter, i.e., The Hague Court In fact I was taking action, not merely as British representative, but also in my capacity as Acting President of the Council.     In any case it is the League Council which has asked the Court for an opinion, and there is no necessity for every Member of the Council to adopt a definite attitude in support of one view or the other of the legal question.2.     It seems clear from the Attorney-General1sviews ...
472views that our case &quot;before the Court would be somewhat inconclusive.     As stated above, such an intermediate case might assist the Court in deciding between the two extreme views, but the result might be an opinion so in-conclusive that the Council would then have to consider the question without the legal side of it having been really decided.     If so, the situation would be very difficult, except in the improbable event of tho whole problem, having been meanwhile settled, out of Court, by the efforts of the European Commission to find an alterna-tive economic solution.     It is, of course, by no moans certain that the Court will not give an inconclusive opinion anyhow, but it would seem undesirable for us to encourage it to do so.3.     Although theoretically His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be &quot;taking sides&quot; by appearing at The Hague, nevertheless for us to argue against the Union however half heartedly will certainly be interpreted by Germany as meaning that we are definitely committed to the French thesis.     This may weaken our influence with the German Government just when we should wish it to be strong. Likewise, if the Court decides in favour of the German case, or even gives an inconclusive opinion, the French Government will expect us to support them in using political pressure to prevent the Union from taking place, and will-be correspondingly disappointed if we decline to do so.4C Even though we may be convinced of the un-desirability of the Customs Union, we should only be aggravating the situation if we were to succeed in preventing ...
4. ( 3preventing it by exercising legal and political pressure. Our whole policy is so to proceed that there are no victors nor vanquished at Geneva.     It was with this object that I urged so strongly in the recent meeting of the Commission on European Union that special sub-committees should be set up in order to devise some substitute for the Union which would enable both France and Germany to save their face.     In these circumstances, when the question has to be considered again both by the Council and the Commission on European Union next September, I should be in a stronger position for acting as honest broker between the disputants if we had not meanwhile appeared before The Hague Court in fact, as well as in theory, as parties to the legal dispute.5.     If we are in substantial agreement with the French Government in holding that the Customs Union must not materialise, it is not because we fundamentally agree with the French thesis but because, on balance, the capacity of France to make political mischief outweighs the economic advantages of what, in itself, may be represented as a wished-for development in the direction of European co-operation.     In other words, we have objected to the Austro-German move, not so much on legal grounds (as to which we have hitherto adopted an attitude of reserve) nor on economic grounds (the Board of Trade have been inclined to favour the Union from the point of view of our commercial interests), but because it was made in a clumsy way, at an inopportune moment and without previous consultation with other Governments, so that it seriously disturbed the good atmosphere which we were trying to create for next year&apos;s Disarmament Conference.Our ...
474Our most important task is to restore that atmosphere and. to devise other, and less objectionable, policies for helping Europe out of its economic difficulties.     We shall be best able to do this by keeping clear of the legal wrangles and preserving our reputation for impartiality and detachment as between the rival groups in Europe.6.     The Customs Union question has attracted com-paratively little comment in the English press.     What comment there has been, either in the press or among the general public, has been remarkably detached, if not actually favourable, to the Austro-German plan.    Nor does this feeling seem confined to any particular party or school of thought.     The form in which the Austro-German scheme presents itself to the public mind is as a laudable attempt to break down tariff barriers, to extend freedom of trade, and generally to find some remedy for the general economic depression in Europe.It is true, of course, that the more informed appreciate the dangerous political implications of the scheme, but here again this appreciation does not take the form of condemning the scheme;   but on the contrary of condemning the French for what they consider to be a narrow, selfish, and short-sighted policy of obstruction. Added to this, there is the argument that the Union is inevitable and that therefore it is not only useless but dangerous for us to resist it.&apos;No doubt public opinion realises that the question involves a purely legal dispute, and I think I can say that there has been no shadow of criticism as regards my action in proposing that this legal dispute should bereferred ...
June 8th, 1931.referred to The Hague Court.     But may not this tie because the public assume that this dispute is one definitely and solely between Prance and Czechoslovakia on one side and Germany and Austria on the other?     In that ca.se they will not understand why His Majesty&apos;s Government should appear in Court as one of the &quot;plaintiffs&quot;.     Our appearance at The Hague may therefore be misrepresented, and this mis-.representation may be difficult to combat.     His Majesty&apos;s Government will appear to the public as collaborating with Prance at The Hague for the express purpose of preventing Germany and Austria from working out their own economic salvation.If public opinion once reacts in this manner it is not likely to be satisfied with the techirj . c al ano. diplomatic reasons which may be advanced in favour of our becoming parties to the suit at The Hague.In particular, we must, count upon the probability of considerable criticism in the Labour and Liberal Parties and in certain organs even of the Conservative press.7.     We must also be prepared for the French press to exploit to the utmost the fact that we have joined with France in presenting to the Court the case against the Customs Union, and they will no doubt try to argue from this action on our part that we are definitely pledged to opposing the Union, not merely on legal, but also on political grounds.     If the French press try to make such political capital out of our action at The Hague, the effect on the press here is likely to make them still more critical of anything which has the appearance of our pre-judging the Issue in favour of France.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCENTRAL EUROPE. April 1, 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.  -[C 2170/673/3] No. 1.Laiv Officers of the Crown to Foreign Office. (Received April 1.)Sir, Royal Courts of Justice, March 31, 1931.I WAS honoured with your commands signified to me in Foreign Office letter of the 27th instant, requesting an opinion as to whether the conclusion of a treaty between Germany and Austria establishing a customs union would be contrary to the treaty obligations of Austria under article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain or under the Protocol No. 1 signed at Geneva on the 4th October, 1922.I have taken the matter into my consideration, and, in obedience to your commands, have the honour to report that: 1. Article 1 of the 3rd Protocol of the 4th October, 1922, indicates that Austria&apos;s undertaking in the 1st Protocol is a political declaration. Moreover, the 3rd Protocol contains specific provisions (e.g., in article 5) for protecting the security of the creditors and the guarantor Powers. I think that the economic provisions of the 1st Protocol have a political object which may be distinct from the protection of the security, and that those provisions should not be read as limited to what is necessary for the protection of the security.2. The independence of Austria referred to in article 88 of the Peace Treaty and in the first paragraph of Austria&apos;s undertaking in the 1st Protocol appears to be political independence.But in the second paragraph the economic independence of Austria is mentioned, and &quot; cette independence &quot; in the last line (line 2 of p. 6) according to the natural construction of the sentence, relates to this economic independence and not to the political independence previously mentioned.3. The immediate question is whether Austria has by the recently concluded agreement impaired or prejudiced (&quot; porte atteinte a&quot;) her economic independence by granting to Germany a special regime or exclusive advantages calculated to threaten the economic independence of Austria. A question which may arise in the future and cannot conveniently be entirely separated from the immediate question, is whether Austria is likely in pursuance of the agreement to make a treaty which will have that effect. There may be a doubt whether at the present stage there has been any &quot; octroi d&apos;un regime special ou d&apos;avantages exclusifs.&quot; But it is to be observed that the treaty is to be made first between Austria and Germany, and! subsequently there may be negotiations for a similar treaty with any other country that desires such a treaty. Thus Germany has already a priority which gives her a privileged position, and might, perhaps, be said to give her exclusive advantages. It seems to me fairly clear that if the treaty were made, there would then be a special regime and exclusive advantages in favour of Germany, unless and until they were generalised by the accession of other countries.4. The most difficult question is whether the special regime and exclusive advantages conferred upon Germany by this agreement, or likely to be conferred upon her by the proposed treaty, are calculated to threaten the economic independence of Austria. That is partly a question for economists, but also may depend partly upon legal considerations and I will give my opinion upon it as requested.5. This agreement carefully preserves the political sovereignty of Austria in all respects (articles 1 (1), 5 (1), 6 (1), 9 (1) (3), 11 (3), 12 (2)). If economic independence means no more than political sovereignty in regard to economic policy, I think it is and will be unimpaired by the agreement or proposed treaty. But since the protocol contemplates that economic independence may be impaired by granting to another State a special regime or exclusive advantages (which would not naturally involve any diminution of sovereignty), I think the phrase &quot; economic independence &quot; must have a wider meaning.[86 a-1]
26. I think the phrase &quot;economic independence&quot; cannot be paraphrased adequately-as meaning either &quot;non-subordination&quot; or &quot;separation&quot;: those words would be more appropriate as explanatory of political independence. It is difficult to conceive an economically subordinate country, unless it were actually tributary : and it is difficult to find much meaning in the phrase &quot; economically separate countries.&quot;I think a better paraphrase would be &quot; effective liberty of action in economic policy.&quot;I think economic independence in that sense implies a power to bind oneself by agreements, and the making of such agreements is an exercise of economic freedom. Austria&apos;s economic independence would not be impaired by making ordinary commercial or tariff treaties.But I think it not improbable that the proposed treaty between Austria and Germany might have the eventual effect of rendering Austria economically dependent upon Germany in the sense that, while Austria would remain legally free to take such action as she chose in the economic sphere, it would, for commercial and other practical reasons, become impossible for her to act otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of Germany or to sever the partnership without disastrous consequences to herself. Much would depend upon the part which customs play in the national economy and internal administration and commercial life of of Austria. The immediate effect of the treaty would be to constitute an Austro-German free trade area enclosed by a tariff wall. That position would probably continue for three years or more, and it might well be that no similar treaty would be concluded with any other country. In the meantime, Austria&apos;s external markets would be increasingly found in Germany, and her external supplies would be increasingly obtained from Germany, since the tariff arrangement would tend to deflect Austria&apos;s trade with other countries into Germany. Eventually, Austria might become a part of the economic system of Germany as fully as Florida is part of the economic system of the United States of America, or Wales is part of the economic system of Great Britain, and might find herself in a position in which she could not sever the partnership without dislocating her industrial and commercial organisation.7. These are conceivable consequences of the proposed treaty, Whether such consequences are or not likely to ensue is not a question upon which a lawyer as such can express an opinion.A lawyer can merely express his view as to the meaning of the term &quot; economic independence.&quot;It is for economists to determine what consequences would in all probability follow from the proposed treaty, and whether the economic independence of Austria, in the sense in which I have explained this phrase, would be threatened. XUpon the hypothesis that the economists would answer this question in the affirmative, I express my opinion that the proposed treaty probably would be a breach by Austria of her undertaking in the 1st Protocol of 1922.8. The attitude of the Powers to the proposed customs union between France and Belgium after the Treaty of London of 1839, appears to afford general support to my view as expressed above, but the question is narrower in this case, because the protocol expressly allows to Austria freedom in the matter of customs tariffs and commercial or financial agreements, subject only to the proviso.I have, &amp;c.WILLIAM A.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCENTRAL EUROPE. April 15, 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[C 2469/673/3] No  1.Board of Trade to Foreign Office. (Received April 15.)Sir, Board of Trade, April 14, 1931.I AM directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letter of the 9th April transmitting copy of the report of the Attorney-General on the case submitted to him with regard to the legality of the proposed Austro-German Customs Union. With reference thereto I am to state, for the information of Mr. Secretary Henderson, that the question whether the practical effect of a customs union between Germany and Austria would be to render &quot; effective liberty of action in economic policy &apos;&apos; on the part of Austria impossible would seem to them to depend to a large extent on questions which are rather political than purely economic in character. In a union of any kind between a large country and a small country, it is clearly likely that the independent action of the small country will, in the nature of things, be more likely to be compromised than the independent action of the larger country, but, whether the union be political or economic, that result is likely to follow, not so much from economic causes as from the fact that the larger country will naturally be politically the predominant partner.So far, however, as economic influences can be separated from more general political considerations there can, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, be little doubt that the ultimate result of a customs union between Germany and Austria would be to render the smaller country dependent to a greater extent upon the common market of the union than would be the case with the larger country, and, to that extent her independence of action would be likely to be more compromised, so that she might be said, in this sense, to have sacrificed in a greater degree than would Germany, her &quot; effective liberty of action in economic policy.&quot;The Board are, therefore, inclined to the view that the consequences envisaged in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 6 of the Attorney-General&apos;s Opinion would, in fact, be likely to ensue.A copy of this letter has been sent to the Dominions Office.I have, &amp;c.H.
