IbcUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,1(31)COPY No.CABINET. STATE OF TRADE - MJkmR^lj^l, Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The reports for Maroh do not bear out, generally speaking, the somewhat more hopeful tone which was apparent in February.    Although there was a net decrease in unemployment as compared with a steep increase in 1930, it was not so great as is normally expected at this time of year and the reports from all the important industries with the exception of wool textiles are disappointing.    In particular the continuance of the boycott in India has been espeoially complained of by Lancashire.   Wholesale prioes show only a slight decline in food, and remained stationary during the month for-materials fComparing March this year with March 1930, domestic exports have decreased in value by 37/? and imports by 24^2. For the first quarter of the year domestic exports show, as compared with the same period of 19 30, a decrease in volume of over 30 per cent., while imports fell in volume by about 6 per cent, only.    The general unemployment percentage increased from 15.9$* in March 1930, to 21,3$&quot; last month. The decrease in the number unemployed at the end of March compared with the end of February of this year (53,-500) was largely amongst women in the textile industries, and consisted of reduotions of 52,500 in the wholly unemployed and 1,000 in the temporarily stopped.    There was a rise in the estimated ramber of insured persons in employment from 9,224,900 on February 23rd to 9,267,200 on March 23rd.&quot;&quot;Labour Gazette figures,
Railway traffic receipts for the five weeks ended April 5th showed a decline of Q%% compared with last year, notwithstanding the inclusion of the Easter holiday in the period this year but net last year, and the consequent slight increase in Passenger traffic receipts.There was again a decline in employment in the coal mining industry and there appears to be little improvement in prospect.   Exports of coal in March were 2A% below those for March last year.    The output fixed by the Central Council for the first quarter of ^he year was approximately 10X less than the actual output for the corresponding period of 1930 and although there has been some difficulty in the Midland district it appears that this allocation has generally been sufficient to meet both home and export demand.    There are signs&apos; that the Act is spreading the available work over the country: there lias been a good demand - D.0.B&apos;e selling at 6d. above limitation prices - for steam coals on the N.E. Coast owing to the quota restriction of Midland coal supplies; and the Co-operative Wholesale Society report, that they are overcoming the difficulties arising from the quota by buying in areas away from their immediate district. In Scotland, however, it is reported that very little progress has been made up to the present with marketing and price fixing schemes and the export trade  shows no improvement owing to continued Polish competition.After the slight improvement in February, employment in the iron and steel industry last month showed a decline.   The rate of output in March was, however, about the  same as in February, and the number of furnaces in blast (Si) also remained the same.    Imports in March were less than a year ago, but exports showed a very much greater decline, and for
each month   since December imports ox iron and steel and manufactures thereof into this country have substantially exceeded exports.   The Continental ferro-manganese market hag now been practically closed to British manufacturers owing to very favourable contracts for the raw material placed by Czechoslovakia with Russia.    In the East, Japan is now competing with us in heavy steel instead of importing from us. At home there is no Improvement in the outlooks    Orders from the home railways have been on a smaller scale than usual.The position of the shipbuilding industry becomes increasingly serious.      Employment declined again last month in shipbuilding and ship-repairing,  the percentage of unemployed at March 23rd, 52.6, being the highest for any important industry.    Quarterly figures just published show that the merchant tonnage under construction at the end of torch was only 700,000 tons, which is 1,000,000 tons less than a year ago.    Moreover, nearly half of this 700,000 tons is accounted for by the Cunard and other big passenger steamers, and another 300,000 by tanker tonnage, so that there is practically no ordinary cargo tonnage going through at all. Nor does there appear to be much sign of improvement in shipping.   The freight index rose from 82.6 last month to 84.1 in Maroh (1913-100).    Outward freights, especially for ooal, are so low that in many cases owners prefer to send ships out in ballast, and this in most cases neutralises the rather better homeward freights, so that there is a loss on the whole voyage which it is reported is about equal to the cost of laying up.   The most recent figures for laid up tonnage show that 1,867,000 tons net of British vessels were laid up in United Kingdom ports on April 1st, an increase of nearly 300,Ooo tons since January 1st.
Employment again declined in the engineering industry especially in marine engineering.     There was no improvement in the motor vehicle industry and the number of not or vehicles newly registered in February was less by 42j? than in February last year.      More&quot;over the general depression is at last beginning to make itself felt in the electrical industry, although only to a small extent as yet.      It is complained that prices are very low and that the call for economy has led to a falling off in orders, both from the railways and from Government Departments, even for ordinary maintenance work.Reports from the  cotton industry are disappointing this month.      There has been a rise in employment, but the hoped for improvement in India has not materialised and the boycott from the economic point of view is stated to be as severe as ever.      In fact it is reported that  certain well-known importers of cotton goods into India, with interests in Indian mills, are abandoning their import business.The improvement in the wool textile industry continues and the more hopeful tone is maintained.      There has been some check, as was to be expected, in the rapid rise in the price of the raw material, but supplies in London are being satisfactoril absorbed and the prices of most qualities of wool have risen since the lowest point in January by from 35 to 50 per cent. They are still, however, below pre-war level.      It is reported from Australia that prices rose appreciably during March, Japan and the Continent buying freely.      The improvement in machinery activity has been mainly in the earlier processes. On the other hand, unemployment, though considerably less than in January and February, is still higher than a year ago, while exports both for the first quarter of this year, and for March compare very unfavourably with last year.
The  reports from the hosiery districts indicate that the seasonal improvement has been somewhat less than was expected for the time of year.      Imports, are, on the whole, on a smaller scale than a year ago, but the effect of the large importations during the year is still being felt.      There has been no improvement in exports, those for last month being considerably below the figures for March last year.As regards other industries, there has bson some seasonal increase In employment in the building industry, but unemployment is still high and there has been no change in the general position.      The position of the chemical industry shows very little  change though the demand from certain branches of the textile industry is somewhat better than at this time last year;    particular complaint was ma.de of the threatened importation of surplus sulphuric acid from Belgium at a price below the British cost of production.      No change is reported in the rubber industry, business being dull in every branch. The boot and shoe industry is a bright spot - normal seasonal activity is reported and in some di stricts firms are working up to full capacity.The price of imported wheat foil again in march after the rise which took place in February.      There has been a certain amount of chartering for wheat from Canada, whose holding policy is stated to have resulted in serious losses.      The Argentine and, especially, Russia are getting the trade at lower prices.      The  United States have shown a disposition to got rid of some  of their stocks, but European buyers are apparently not showing interest.      There are good supplies of wheat in Australia, which, owing to the financial position, ere having to be disposed of at low prices and there are rumours of a move in India to have a tariff imposed against it.
The Co-operative &quot;Wholesale Society reports that retail prices of foodstuffs are falling more into line with wholesale prices.     The Ministry of Labour cost of living index (food only) was 129 for April 1st   (100 * July, 1914) a fall of 5 points in the month and the corresponding change in the Board of Trade wholesale index (food) was from 67.2 to 66.8 (1924 .100).     After the successful sales in January, February was as usual quiet in the departmental stores but the quantity of goods sold was probably not less than in February last year)    the figures for this country compare favourably with the corresponding results in both the United States of America and Germany.      The Co-operative Societies again report an increase in the quantities sold compared with a year ago and an increase in the savings depositod with them.The monetary outlook has improved during March.      The Bank of England has been able to maintain the discount rate, except for a short time, at 216/&apos;&apos; with the result that the principal Foreign Exchanges and especially the French have moved in favour of   sterling so much that the Bank of England has been able, for the first time for twelve months, to buy gold in the open market and has Increased its holdings by about  6,000,000.      This remains, however, ovor  12,000,000 less than a year ago, less than a quarter of the gold held by the Federal Reserve Bank, and less than a third of that held by the Bank of France.New capital issues have not met with encouraging results; in particular, 96 per cent, of the 6%% Debentures offered by the Bankers Industrial Development Company for the Lancashire Cotton Corporation at 97-1% was left with the underwriters.Great satisfaction is expressed at the results of the Prince of Wales&apos;s tour in South America, provided of course they are followed up;    notwithstanding higher tariffs it is
believed that the general outlook for British trade in the Argentine is improving.      In South America generally the problem is to deal with excessive production e.g. in cereals and coffee.      ill are is an accompanying tendency to restrict imports;    in particular Brazil has placed an embargo on textile machinery with a view apparently to restrict production.      In -Ghile the semi-Government concern for the centralisation of the nitrate Industry (Cosach) has now come into being and it Is thought that this will improve the&apos;   . &apos; .....   ...prospect of arrangements being made to regulate the world production of nitrates.W.G.Board of Trade. 5th May, 1931.

MMEETING OF THE BO.ABD OP TRAPS ADVISORY COUNCIL. Thursday, 16th April, 1931.CHEMICALS.DR.  CLAYTON:    For fine chemicals:    the position remains substantially unchanged, with the temporary activity for medicinals, which has been noted in previous reports-      It would appear that the Indian boycott position is rather easier.For heavy chemicals - (Alkali):    on a comparative basis business in February compared rather more favourably with last year than did that in January.      Apart from some slackening in the demand for the glass trade, business in the United Kingdom remained fairly steady.      Sales in China and India were much the same as those last year, but in Japan, Russian competition has resulted in an attenrpt by local producers and dealers to clear stock at low prices.      February results compare favourably in this market with those of January,  although the cumulative results for the year are less favourable than last year5s results.      Sales in South America are still seriously affected by agricultural depression.      The sheet galvanising industry is still inactive, and acid sales are suffering in consequence.      The consumption of sulphuric acid by many consuming industries shows no signs of improving.Some improvement in certain branches of the textile industry is having the effect of somewhat increasing the demand for chemicals by that industry.      Such improvement is to be expected at this time of year, but the position compares favourably with that ruling last year, when&apos;the Rayon trade was particularly inactive,,On account of the bad weather,, the usual seasonal, demand for ammonium sulphate only commenced at the end of February and was confined, to the South of England.-      The season is undoubtedly late and the manufacturers of mixed fertilisers are finding the demand is at least a month later than is usualr Owing to the severe agricultural depression,  the total demand for fertilisers this year is likely to show a distinct falling off,      There has been a certain amount of competition from ammonium sulphate imported into both Great Britain and Ireland from Continental sources.Conditions in the dye consuming trade have shown very little,  if any, improvement during the last few weeks.      The effect of the lock-out in the cotton trade is now making itself felt in the dyeing and finishing section, and some weeks must elapse before the effect of.the settlement - which is considered to be of a temporary nature - can.be seen;    shortage of cloth rather than shortage of orders is a general complaints      It is believed that some good will come of the publicity obtained at the Artificial Silk Exhibition and the British Industries Fair and it is hoped that this activity on the part of the textile industries will be reflected in the consumption of dyestuffs. Reports from the wool industry indicate little improvement in the demand for colours,  the tweed trade finding rather more business,  although demand from the Far East for Venetians is only half normal.&apos;    The low prices for wool have resulted in a
slightly brighter -prospect in the worsted slubbing end yarn dyeing section, while foreign tariffs are having an adverse influence in the coating trade.     Piece dyers in the artificial silk trade are having fair demands, orders being refused owing to the low prices offered.      There is very little to report as to coal tar products as generally the markets are at a minimum.A letter was addressed to you, Sir, from the Chairman of the National Sulphuric Acid Association on the 10th of this month, calling attention to the threat to British sulphuric acid manufacturers from the surplus production in Belgium. There are agents at present attempting to secure orders for sulphuric acid in this country, and they are offering at a figure which is below the cost of production in this country and that is due to our higher taxation costs and higher labour costs.      v/e cannot meet them.     Now these agents are attempting to secure these orders and if they can secure sufficient orders they propose to bring the acid across in tanks.      It is a threat to the manufacturers on the East Coast especially.      I do not really see what can be dene but if they -should succeed in closing definite orders in this country it is a very serious threat to the sulphuric acid manufacturers on this side and sulphuric acid is very essential to large numbers of industries.PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE;    Is that quite a new development?ER.  CLAYTON:    Yes,  in Belgium, for certain reasons one being the reduction in the manufacture of ammonium sulphate, they have a surplus stock of sulphuric acido      There is also slackness of trade generally.      They have a surplus of sulphuric acid above their own requirements and are trying to see if they can place it in this country at a very low ;price.      It is very difficult for the manufacturers in this country to compete with that..IRON AND STEEL..MR. WALMSLEY:    I am afraid there is very little change in either direction since we met more than a month ago.      The March figures of production both for pig iron and steel are practically the same as the February figures, when you take into account the difference in the number of working days,. Imports of iron and steel were 210,500 tons in March as against 177,100 in February and 280,000 tons in March,  1930,   &apos; For the seventh month in succession imports exceeded exports, which of course is quite a reversal of what we thought v/as the normal condition.      The exports in March amounted to 170,000 tons which is only a little more than half what they were in the corresponding month of last year - 338,000 tons.      There is practically no change in the outlook.Shipbuilding is still absolutely dead.      The home railway companies have placed certain orders* for their relaying programmes which have helped to keep the rail mills going during the last few weeks, but I i.;m afraid we shall soon get to the end of those orders,      They are on a smaller scale than usual*See page   30
In Scotland the steel producing plant is supposed to be working at no more than 2&amp;j of capacity.     Scotland is perhaps getting a little help in the shape of orders for steel from the large Cunard vessels.      Apart from that there is nothing of any importance in sight.     There are certain enquiries and orders I believe for Russia which Scotland seems to think may help them indirectly - enquiries or orders for ships which will reflect on the steel trade.We are doing a really steady business in Canada.     Perhaps we are doing as well there as anywhere else in the world at the moment, but it is cnly comparatively small tonnages coming through at the present time.On the Continent the drop in prices seems to have stopped largely because two or three of the large works in Belgium withdrew from the market owing to the very low figures that have been reached, and the German steel works have now dropped out from competition partly I believe because they are rather busy on some orders they have secured from Russia, and they do not want any more cheap work at the moment.     There has been a slight hardening of the Continental prices but nothing to speak of. Japan is becoming an increasingly awkward competitor in certain markets.     We used to send a great deal of heavy steel to Japan, but we da not send any there now.      We find Japan constantly competing with us in the East for not only plain steel but constructional work and small bridge work.There is one branch of the iron and steel trade which I do not think I have referred to specifically on previous occasions, but it is rather   .an interesting one, that is the ferro manganese.      There are only I think five British makers of ferro manganese and that has been in the last few months practically the only bright spot from the manufacturing point of view.      That is now again in the same way as all the other departments of the iron and steel trade - the production has been very materially reduced and the prices have come down to an unremunerative level.      Of course the general decline in steel production accounts for the reduction in the output of ferro manganese. They go together, but the decline in the price is really due to the intervention of Russia in connection with Czechoslovakia. Russia has made some I believe extraordinarily favourable contracts with one of the firms in Czechoslovakia&quot;    to take large supplies of Russian manganese ore and they are converting that into ferro and sel.ling it very cheaply with the result that our makers have practically lost their Continental trade.     We used to do a very nice trade on the Continent but we have done nothing on the Continent during the last four or five months.      There seems to be no chance of getting that trade back.ICR, GILLETT; The steel orders you spoke of from Russia to Scotland - are those orders that are expected will be placed or are they merely vague enquiries&apos;?MR. WAIiiSLliiY:    I have no definite knowledge that they are likely to be firm orders yet.      everybody is clutching at straws and I should imagine that they are very much in the air still. There have been, I believe,  certain orders for machinery from firms but whether they will benefit Scottish iron and steel I do not knew.      They are included in the report from Scotland. There seems to be some little ray of hope of increased business through these Russian contracts.
WOOL.ALDMRMAN TITTERINGTONs      Wool values continued to show a strong upward tendency until the latter part of March when a slight easing developed.     The rise has &quot;been so rapid that it is not surprising that a halt has been called.     Since the lowest point was touched in January most qualities of wool have risen by amounts varying from 35i? to 50v!.      The full advance has not been passed on through the subsequent stages of the industry, and it looks as if a period of digestion will be required before it is assimilated.There has been some improvement in machinery activity, but it is much more marked in the early processes than it is in the later processes.     Manufacturers are only a little better employed.    There has been a spurt of activity in light weight woollens for ladies&apos; wear, but it is dying down again.     The number of unemployed in the wool textile industry in the West Siding (using the returns for the six principal centres as an illustration) was 30,700 at 25rd March as- compared with 35,000 in January and 24,800 a   year ago.      It is quite evident that the advance in values has not been forced by increased consumption! It has been due to a return of confidence in values, which has led to a wholesale replenishment of stocks of wool and a certain amount of speculative buying.      Although there is an easier tendency at the moment, many traders are confidently expecting that fine wools will reach new high levels in the Autumn,    Values of course are still well below pre-war levels.Although the recovery from the point of view of employment may be slow, there seems to be a universal belief that the wool textile industry has seen its worst.     The somewhat heavy supplies of wool in London, which have been swollen by wools bought in Australia solely for exchange remittance purposes, are being absorbed in a very satisfactory manner.Further conferences have taken place between representatives of the Trade Unions and the employers in the dyeing and finishing industry and there are efforts being made for a settlement on the basis of a reduction in wages.     This reduction is in addition to the reductions already resulting from the cost of living sliding scale, and in principle is as follows:-   for time workers the cost of living wage is in future to be exactly equivalent to the Ministry of Labour cost of living index instead of falling somewhat more slowly as at present;    for piece workers, whose cost of living wage remains equivalent to 80$ of the cost of living index, reduction is 1$ on gross piece earnings.      Some 80,000 employees, mainly in Lancashire and Yorkshire are involved. I will give in the usual figures.*There was a meeting in Manchester yesterday with &apos;a view to trying to organise a joint cotton and wool exhibition in connection with the British Industries Fair.      It was just a preliminary conference.*See page   38.
OO-OPEFATIvE TRADE.MR.  CAIRNS;    One feature of the business for the past month is that the sales of primary articles of food such as sugar-, butter and bacon again exhibit a considerable falling off expressed in money, while the quantities sold continue to be larger than they were a year ago.Another feature is that notwithstanding the abnormally large number of unemployed, the savings of the members as embodied in the funds of the Co-operative Societies keep growing, and in Scotland the Wholesale Society is receiving from the Retail Societies much more capital as shares and loans than it can profitably employ either in productive or distributive enterprises.-      While comparatively few families of the working class are not in membership with a Co-operative Society,  the bulk cf them own only a small amount of capital per head, and in general the Co-operative purchases of this body r-f members are correspondingly small,      In view of this fact, it is sometimes alleged in relation to the growth of capital under present industrial conditions that such an experience goes to prove that the therough-going supporters of the Co-operative Movement are mainly those working people who are in steady employment and in receipt of substantial wages^      There may or may not be a measure of truth in that statement, but of almost any City in Scotland it can be said that the poorest localities contain successful Co-operative shops.      These&apos; observations are made for the purpose of showing the difficulty of finding an intelligible explanation of this somewhat unexpected growth of capital under outwardly unfavourable circumstances.For the principal articles of food a steadiness of price is now experienced at the low points which have been reached. The bottom generally seems at last to have been touched, accordingly there is less pressure to sell and more inclination to hold than has been felt for many months.      It may be noted that at the moment the price of Danish butter for the period of the year is the lowest recorded since 1913.      The arrivals of Colonial butter during April will be greater than a year ago. Excellent quality continues to be a feature of New Zealand butter, and its popularity is increasing.There is a very large demand for Continental bacon, particularly Danish,  and supplies are plentiful.      Our own bacon factories at Enniskillen and Kilmamock respectively are fully employedo      The prices of Irish bacon and hams are unchanged since last report while Ayrshire bacon is a -gd. per lb. higher owing to a local scarcity of pigs.      Irish bacon is l/O-gd. per lb. Ayrshire l/O^d. Danish bacon llid,   and Dutch bacon lO^d. Scotch oats have become scarce during the last few weeks and the prices have advanced 3/- per quarter during the period. Farmers, it seems, have been induced by the low prices to use more extensively than they do in ordinary times their own oats for feeding purposes.      In seme cases farmers -are now buying foreign oats for future requirements, as the remaining stocks of their own oats will be exhausted before the next crop is available.    i Scotch oatmeal has,  in consequence experienced a sharp advance in price and is likely to go higher.During last month the prices of most grades of wheat continued to sag,  and local quotations are on the average fully 1/- a quarter lower than they were a month ago,      Australian -wheat is being largely. offered and while that from some districts!
Mis rather poor in quality, consignments from Western Australia are the finest that our mills have ever received from that quarter.      Following the course of wheat,  flour shows an average decrease in price of 9d, per sack during the month. There is an improved demand at the moment for home milled flour, the supposition being that the comparatively high price of bran is enabling the Scotch mills to compete successfully with imported flour.Throughout Easter v/hen the seasonal demand is exceptionally large,  eggs remained low in price, at 2d, per dozen below the figures for last year,  and for the first time over many years fresh and well sized eggs were retailed at l/r per dozen.      The last report showed an improved market in potatoes and since then the improvement has continued. Farmers are being paid  6.10.0 to  6.15.0 per ton for late varieties and round  6 a ton for the earlier varieties.      The demand is very strong and large quantities are being exported to England.The milk trade on which a report has been made from time to time, especially in reference to the &quot;Pool&quot;, has lapsed into an unsatisfactory position from the farmers point of view in the West and South West of Scotland.     The &quot;Pool&quot; is dragging out a functionless existence and owing to the large surplus of milk concentrating in its hands supplies in Glasgow and district have been reduced to lOd. per gallon.      This is an exceptionally low price for the month of April, which is the most expensive month for the production of milk in Scotland. It seems odd that the combination of farmers should be the means of depressing below what is fair and just to the producer and consumer, a vitally important article,   like milk.The preserve factories for the manufacture of jams and jellies have been on short time throughout the greater part cf this season.     While industrial depression does somewhat affect this trade,  it is not the principal factor in the case,  as jams and jellies form a cheap and convenient form of food.      The main causes of the reduced demand have been the combination of-cheap fruit and cheap sugar,  leading to the malting of preserves domestically,  and the increased consumption of butter induced &quot;by the relatively low price of that article.      In the various factories for the making of textile goods, boots and furniture, there has been no important change in conditions during the month.SIS HUGO HIRST:   At a recent meeting there was a report on the trade with Russia.      Has that increased?MR. CAIRNS:   No, about the same, except the tea trade. Y/e do a large tea trade with Russia.      We do that in conjunction with the CvW.S. the English Wholesale Society.   We reported before that they get from us for the tea trade a revolving credit of  300,000.     At the moment the amount of that credit is about  400,000.      Owing to the low .price of butter our margarine factory has been employed only 75^4 of its full capacity and 25% of it is going to Russia.MR. WAIMSLEY:   Can Mr. Cairns tell us whether the deplorah condition of the milk trade in Scotland is due to importations of milk either liquid or otherwise?MR. CAIRNS.   No,  there is no importation of milx into Scotland.
i 3 wMR, FOLLETT HOLT;    I will hand in a short memorandum* beyond which I have nothing special to say to-day.GOAL,  IRON AND STDML III SCOTLAND.MR. MITCHELL;    As regards the coal trade in Scotland a settlement has been arrived at on the wages agreement with the Scottish miners for the period to 30th Jane.      The arrangement involves a spread ever of hours - 8 hours per day for 11 days per fortnight,      The Miners Federation of Great Britain have not yet given consent to this arrangement.Very little progress has been made with the marketing schemes.     Great difficulty is found in fixing prices which will be in accordance with the requirements of the Act and yet be effective.      There is no improvement in local sales.      There has been a reduction in the prices of house coals.      Small coals are almost unsaleable due largely to the small consumption of the iron and steel works.      There is no improvement in export and Poland is still taking most of the &quot;business,      The outlook is bad.      Shipments for the week to 11th April were 201,384 compared with 205,981 tons for the previous week and 242,584 tons for the corresponding week of 1930.      The output remains much the same,  the figures for weeks to 21st and 28Ma March being respectively 545,300 tons and 611,164 tons.      The coke market shows no improvement, and there has &quot;been a further reduction in prices.      There was an average profit shown for February of 4a98d. per ton.As regards pig iron the production in February in Scotland was 13,400 tons compared with 15,500 tons in January and 50,400 tons in February 1930,      The imports of foreign pig iron in February were 10,670 tons as compared with 15,159 &quot;consider in January,    Of the quantity in February 2,972 were from India, 962 tons being &quot;basic.      No basic pig iron was imported from the Continent, but there were imported 7,698 tons - &quot;of foundry and forge pig iron.      Seven furnaces were in blast at the end of February.Mr, Walmsley has already referred to the question of steel.-      The production in February was 80,500 tons compared with 47,500 tons in January and 146,600 tons in February 1930, January of course was affected by the New Year holidays.      The position at the steel works is worse than it was a month ago. Practically all the works have had some weeks entirely idle and when they were working they had only about four days a week of two shifts per day.      The imports of steel into Scotland in February were 20,917 tons as compared with. 28,442 in January and 38,237 tons in December,      Scrap continues to be very plentiful without much change in price.      The imports into Scotland in February were 3,807 tons and the exports 579 tons. For the whole country the exports again largely exceeded the imports.      Poland, France, Belgium and Spain took large quantities.No improvement is shown in shipbuilding.   &quot; Orders have been placed within the last few weeks for two small steamers but the berths on the river are gradually becoming empty and some yards ha&apos;ve no work on hand.      The tube trade shews no improvement.      A few orders have been placed for large pipes.*See page   23 -7-
The export trade to Australia continues to he very small. Remittances are heing received hut with difficulty.COAL.i a? 0MR.  BENTON JONES;    The average output for the 13 weeks from December 27th to March 28th was 4,479,000 tons compared with 5,245,000 tons in the corresponding period last year, an average decrease of 766,000 tons per week.      The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ending March 21st last was 871,000 and the average for the thirteen weeks ended on tho same day was 879,000 compared with 954,900 for the corresponding period last year.      Unemployment for the month of February was 22.5$ against 19,5$ in January and an average of 20.551 in 1930.      The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in February was 3,352,000 tons as compared with 3,070,000 tons in January (an increase of 232,000 tons as compared with January) and 4,537,000 tons in February 1930.*   That is a decrease compared with February 1930 of 1,184,000 tons or 25$.      The average price f. o.b. in February was 16/Id.  as compared with 15/5d. in January, 16/ld. in Deoember,      The January price was affected by the stoppages in South Wales,  the f.o.b. price there being higher than in other districts.To Scandinavia the ex )orts in February 1931 were 209,000 tons;    the monthly average in 1913 was 825,000 tons.      For Belgium and Holland the figures are practically the same for the two periods.      In February 1931 to all destinations the figures were 3,353,000 tons compared with 6,117,000 tons in 1913. jThe Central Council under the Coal Mines Act of 193d) fixed the quantity of coal allowed to be produced by the several mining districts for the first quarter of this year at 62,256,000 tons which is approximately 10$ lower than the output actually produced in the corresponding quarter of 1930. The quarterly allocation represents maxima which the several districts may not exceed, but within these maxima the Council are required to fix the rate at which the output should be produced in each district.     Although in the Midland District, which includes Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derby,  there has been some difficulty,  it appears that the output produced generally is sufficient to meet the demand at home and abroad during the first quarter of the year.      With regard to the future,  the demands for the first quarter of the year having been met by an output which is 10&apos;&quot;&apos;* less than the corresponding quarter ef 1930 there does not appear to be any grounds for anticipating any improvement.      Should this prove to be the case and should the output for the whole of 1931 be less by 10% than it was in 1930, the output for 1931 would be only 223,000,000 tons, which would be the lowest output produced in any single year - except the years 1921 and 1926 - since 1901. The effect on other  trades of such a reduction in coal production is indicated by the following figures:    assuming the amount of direct wages paid is 10$ lower than in 1930,  this would represent  10;250.000 reduction in spending power of the wage earners in the mining industry;    if the quantity of material used is 10$ lower than in 1930,  this represents in value  1,800,000 reduction in the goods required in the mining-industry.*The figure for March was 3,613,000 tons as compared with 4,783,000 in March 1930,
the reduction in the receipts of the railways for the carriage of coal will he approximately  2,400,000 if the average  rate per ton is not less than 2/--;    there would also he a considerable reduction in the earnings of ship-ping.      I do not know what that figure would be, but a large proportion - say more than half the reductions in output would be reductions in export.I have put in a chart* which shows the output each year since 1375 and which will show what it will go down &apos;to in 1931 if the rate of reduction for the first quarter of the year continues.      I prepared some time ago a chart which shows the production of coal in ten yearly periods from 1550 to recent years,  and taking it in ten yearly periods there is no break in the upward curve of production of coal from 1660 to 1913.      That is getting on for 300 years, and yet from 1913 down to 1931 it has gone back very considerably - over 60,000,000 tons,      These it would seem are very extraordinary figures and show a very great loss in one of the staple trades of this country.COTTON,MR.  EARLO&apos;,/:    I said last month&apos;/ that there had been a considerable rise in the price of rav/ cotton since the b eginning of the year, but that it was too early to say whether this was due to &quot;bear&quot; covering or whether there had been a definite increase of buying on the part of consumers.      The latter does not seem to have taken place and there has been a considerable recession in the last few weeks.      At the moment of writing it is reported that buyers in the United States of America are being tempted by low prices to purchase, but there still exists no real confidence and the decision of the Federal Farm Board to withdraw support has accentuated the prevailing feeling of uncertainty.Bitter disappointment exists in Lancashire that the Indian situation has not,  so far as the boycott is concerned,  shown any improvement.      If it has been lifted as a political weapon it remains economically as effective as ever and there has been no increase in demand for cotton piece goods.A considerable amount of discussion is talcing place in the trade as to various plans for the rationalisation of the industry but as no decision has been arrived at by the different trade organisations it is too early to determine what form,  if any, will be adoptedoWOOL,l-nR. DOUGLAS H^IILTON:    Alderman Titterington has covered the ground fairly well with regard to the woollen textile trade and made comments on the position.     Any observations I might make would be more or less in accordance with hisc&apos;:4:!!*See Annex page   40tSee page 8 of Minutes of Larch 12th - A.C.221. **See report page 19.
ladI spent the greater part of March on the Continent, particularly Eastern Europe and I thought perhaps one or two comments on the situation there might he of Interest.      In Germany I found prevailing over the whole country a good deal of despondency and depression.     They have about 5 million unemployed I am told.     Generally speaking I think the concerns which are suffering the most are the larger units.     One which I have in mind is perhaps the largest woollen and worsted spinning concern in the world, the N(f0K, with a capital, of 75 million marks.      They are moderately well employed but they are cutting prices to such an extent that they are losing money rapidly,,     The production of worsted yarn is greater than the demand and competition in every European country is so keen that it is a very unprofitable game.     The bigger the concern the more rapidly they are losing money.     There is a general complaint that wages are too high.      In some sections of the textile industry the figure is given as 220 as against 100 pre-war and attempts are being made to get a reduction. Credit is very shaky and one has to be particularly careful in these days to whom one sells.     Generally speaking the conditions in Germany correspond to those in England,,      One notices that the people are better dressed than they were before the war, and they dress more on the English style.     There is a good demand for Scotch tweeds and British textiles in men&apos;s wear particularly, and in spite of the depression one does not notice it in the streets in the dress of the people0I then went on to Austria, that small country that is feeling very much the impossibility cf their present economic situation.     It is far too small a unit to stand on its own. I found that the British Chamber of Commerce in Vienna was in low water, in fact it was doubtful whether it would last more than a few months, and I got the impression that the Government might do well to support Chambers of Commerce in these smaller countries rather than maintain a Commercial Secretary there. The cost would he very much smaller.      I suppose the cost of maintaining a Commercial Secretary is somewhere about  3,000, while  300 would go a long way to keeping a Chamber of Commerce going.      It would be a considerable economy and just as effective.In Hungary there was a good deal of talk - this was before the recent German-Austrian.... . Zollvereins - about linking up with Austria.      There is a general demand for it, but the Austrians and Hungarians dare not take the step because of their neighbours, but they are anxious to come into it.I then went on to Jugoslavia which I found comparatively prosperous.      They are making a good deal of progress and seemed very happy and contented as compared with other countries in Europe.      There is a good deal of building going on, particularly French enterprise,,      They are throwing nev/ bridges ever the Save and the Danube, and those constructional works are mainly being done by French firms.Bulgaria is of course only a small country relatively speaking.      They seem to have turned the corner, though they would appear to have had a bad time.      That is one of the few countries where I found there was a decision to revise the tariff downwards, especially amongst bankers and civil servants there   &apos; is a demand for that *In Greece the people are very friendly disposed towards this country.      They would like to do a bigger trade with us
1 3 ! I d and it has a very much richer population than the other Balkan countries, and I feel that we are not making the most of our opportunities there.      We ought to he doing more trade than v/e are with them.      One sees a few English cars about nowadays, Morris&apos;, and one or two other cars have opened an office in Athens, and started doing trade, out there is more scope for British trade in Greece than in most of the other European countries.Generally speaking en the Continent the political situation is very unsettled and that is having its effect on business generally.SHIPPING.SIR ERNEST GLOVER:    I am afraid there is very little change to report in the general situation and there has been practically no improvement.     The freight index number for march about 84 shows a slight advance on February, 82.      That is based on 100 for the figure for 1913,  so that we are still a long way below the 1913 level in freights, whilst of course expenses and costs are 70^ more.      Coal exports in March were according to my figures,  something like 100,000 tons over February, but nearly li million less than March 1930,      The rates being paid for carriage of coal are so low that in many directions the steamers are going out in ballast rather than take coal cargo,      In homeward grain chartering only a small business has been done from Scuth Russia, but there is a very large business from the Argentine, principally in maize. The rates from the Argentine suffered a severe slump because a number of steamers went out in ballast rather than take out freights, and they arrived together, and brought down the rates very considerably,     ^hen they were cleared off the.rates improved again to some extent, but the level of rates practically means loss to 99&apos;&quot; ox the steamers employed and that loss is about equivalent to the cost of laying ships up. In the East there is little of interest to record.     A few steamers for rice from Burma have been chartered and from Australia a few steamers, but there is no very great activity. South Africa has not been interested in chartering.      There is an indication of a desire to liquidate some of the accumulated wheat of America and Canada and several steamers have been chartered, particularly from Canada, and there are some shipments of wheat from Vancouver.      There has been considerable demand for tonnage for sugar from Cuba.Shipbuilding has been referred to already.      No orders for cargo steamers are reported.      Apparently the only business placed has boen for a tank steamer and a passenger steamer,  the latter for Jugo-slav account - otherwise there is nothing.    The returns on Lloyds Register which has just been published for the quarter show a very big diminution in the cargo vessels under construction:    it is under 700,000 tons,  1,000,000 tons less than it was a year ago, and of that 700,000 tons nearly half is accounted for by the big passenger steamers like the Cunards and the &quot;Empress of Britain&apos; and some P.  and 0. boats, and one or two others, and something like 300,000 tons in tank tonnage,  so that these figures show that there is practically no ordinary cargo tonnage being built at all.      Mith regard to tonnage laid up there does not seem to be any reduction, in fact the quantity in this country has increased by 200,000 to 300,000 tens,  and the amount of world tonnage idle is round about 9,000,000 gross tons,  so that the position is very bad. I am putting in the usual figures*.*See page   17 -11-
MR. WALTER SMITH:    Have any steps been taken with regard to an increase of chartering nf tonnage by Russia?SIR ERNEST GLOVSRj    No, the Russians have got something like 60 or 70 steamers on time charter pretty well on their own terms, and for the present- they say they have all they want.      The British shippers generally have stood out against it.     Last year they had 150 or 200 steamers on time, and it is just a question whether they will have to come back for more tonnage or not.     At present there is nothing going cn there.BNG- INS. JRING.MR. ROWLAND:.    The reports for February again make very doleful reading.      The figures certainly reveal no symptom of definite or impending recovery in the basic industries, but on the other hand,  there is no feature cf marked further retrogression except in two instances which unfortunately relate intimately to our own industry.      The percentage of unemployment -amongst insured workers in all trades and industries throughout the country increased only from 21.5$ to 21.7% during the month of February, the index fer the engineering industry however rose from 24.4;/, to 25.5$.     Even allowing for the shortened duration of February that month shows the lowest tonnage exported in any month for several years past, and it is to be noted that the average value per ton at  95.9 compares unfavourably with  99.8 f*r January and with  97.5 as the average for 1930,With regard to agricultural engineering which affects my own group particularly, successive missions come back and tell us that this trade has been lost to this country.     We have sent out for years and kept: in the closest touch with the export markets of the world.     We met those demands before the war.     We brought our plants up to date arid gave very careful examination to our machinery and plant and they are not in any way inferior to others,.     We have enquired into every item*of , our cost of production and still our prices are too high.     It cannot be that the Americans are dumping their surplus production because the Argentina demands a special type of machine and I propose to send the President a memorandum dealing with the question of shipping freights,*     Some years ago with the assistance of the Department of Overseas Trade and Sir Edward Crowe we were able to have remedied a very great handicap.     We found that for a thresher, a very important product in agricultural engineering, we were being charged 40/-freight while American threshers were being carried in British bottoms at 32/-.     Now we have since found that American threshers and other machines carried in British bottoms to New Zealand are being carried at more than the reduced preference which the Dominion gives us on the goods,      I can give you the rates, and in this memorandum I will give     chapter and verse, where the Americans are having these threshers carried at 32/-and we are being charged 71/-     There are other instances.    I believe I speak for the whole industry v/hen I say that every manufacturer has examined his costs very closely but we cannot overcome handicaps cf that nature and  .if you consider that the matter is one either for independent action or for this Committee I think the facts I shall submit to you will justify their examination.*This has new been received and is under examination.
MR. WALTER SMITH J    We shall he only too willing to look into any statement you submit to us on that to see if anything can be done to remove the handicap.     The figures you give seem to be rather startling,MR. ROWLAND.    The figures are not easy to get and it is difficult to get any information.We have taken into our employ in our various overseas branches men who have been emplcyed by our competitors in America, and there can be no doubt that the rates which we shall submit are actual rates charged.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR HUGO HIRSTt    The electrical industry has withstood the general trade depression perhaps longer than any other industry, but during the last 6 months the falling off in business has made itself felt month by month to an increasing degree.     It is not a very large percentage but it is growing. The decrease In the volume of business offering is due to the stagnation in the basic industries such as iron, coal, steel, shipbuilding, cotton and textiles, coupled with a Mg reduction in exports particularly to Australia, India and China. Whilst.there has been quite recently a reduction in the volume of imports into the country, competition from this   source has been severe, as in times of bad trade there is a tendency for buyers to purchase in the cheapest possible market irrespective of quality.In an earlier report this year* I referred to the fact that the falling off in London was relatively greater than for Provincial districts and this has been maintained up to the end of the March quarter.     Conditions in London during the past month were also to some extent affected by the electricians! strike which has now been settled.     On account of the economy policy pursued by Government Departments and Railway companies, the amount of work in these directions has been less than in ordinary years, and this policy has been applied not only to newj] capital commitments but even to ordinary maintenance work which naturally affects us.ftAnother factor which has had a reflection on the electrical! industry is the decline in the building programme of the Icountry and, generally speaking, prices quoted have been on a    1 rather unremunerative basis.     The various Associations connected with the electrical industry have endeavoured to fstimulate the demand in certain specified directions and these, \ to some extent, have borne fruit.     In this connection there continues to be a1 steady and increasing demand for all kinds of I domestic electric-al appliances.The latest returns of units by authorised undertakers in 1 the United Kingdom show that in the month of March there was an I increase from * 963,000,000 units in 1930 to 1,038,000,000 unitsfe in March 1931, This represents an increase of 75,000,000 unite! or 7,56 per centw This increase is greater than for the two g preceding months,- but falls considerably below the average increase in 1929 of 14 per cent.*See page 36 of the Minutes of the 108th Meeting, Thursday, January 8th, 1931.
The work placed by the Central Electricity Board for high tension switoh gear transformers and power lines has caused oertain seotions of the industry to be busy; but the demand for eleotrioal generating plant is still practically non-existent.    The depression in the basic industries has also oaused almost a complete cessation of orders for industrial motors, controllers etc      In order to maintain the general organisation of the industry intact, most firms on the manufacturing side are keeping many departments going at a Iobs with consequent interference to the prosperity of other departments.MR. GILLETTs    Is there any reason why the export to China should have fallen off?SIR HUGO HIRST;    It took us by surprise,,     I presume the price of silver Is the cause,MR. GILLETT:   You are oomparing with a year ago?SIS HUGO HIRSTj    Yes,EMPLOYMENT.MR. HYLTONs    I have to report a slight reduction in unemployment during the month of March.     During that month on the average experience of recent years one would expeot an improvement in unemployment and the fall in the number Of unemployed during the past month was not quite so great as that average but at any rate It was a fall in the number of unemployed as compared with the very steep increase In that month In 1930.    There wore fluctuations during the month week by week, but the net decrease was 53,500.   The total at -the 2nd Maroh, was 2,634,000. and then these fluctuations, as I have said took place, and. towards the end of the month the figure was 2,581,000.     That, as I say, was a fall of 53,500 and that figure of net reduction was made up of a decrease of roc?    about .*3j?088 In the number of wholly unemployed and aBgOiaii i,pOO &apos; of those temporarily stopped.    The reduction was mainly in the number of unemployed women although there was also a substantial reduotion in the number of juveniles.    The number of men on the register decreased by 10,000 while the number of women decreased by 32,000 and the number of juveniles by 10,000,    If one looks at it by divisions there was a reduotion in London, South Eastern and South Western of 32,000, while there was an increase in the Midlands of about 20,000. The North Eastern and Scotland Divisions remained steady.    In tho North West there was a deoreass of 22,000 and in Wales there was a good steady decline in the numbers of unemployed during the month - principally in ooal mining,    that is naturally a seasonal deoline.The prinoipal induotries whore employment declined were coal mining, engineering, iron and steel manufacture, and shipbuilding and shiprepairing.    Those are the industries that suffered most.   Thero was a slight improvement in the distributive trades and a distinct decrease in tho number employed In the cotton and wool industries and in the &quot;building trade.     As a result of the growth in the number of persons who are getting into industry and oan be set off against the numbers unemployed, we estimate provisionally that thero were at the end of March about 42,000 more people in
BOOTS AHD SHOES.MR. BOS TOOK sent the following report: -There is little to say about the trade itself beyond recording the usual seasonal improvement at this time of year.    Buyers generally have been withholding their hands buc had to order to cover their Easter requirements. Complaints are rife that every year orders are placed later and manufacturers are submitted to greater strains.I quote for your information from the trade correspondents of the Shoe and Leather Record:-Leicester.&quot;Last week most shoe manufacturers here made their maximum output with their existing staffs.   Marry- y firms who were on short time a month ago were working under high pressure last week, and some admit that they will not be able to make delivery for another three or four weeks yet of goods that were wanted for the Easter trade ....It cannot be argued that the British manufacturer neglects any opportunity to get what business is going, for many of them have been getting out new spring samples every day for nearly six months past.    One firm, indeed, told me a few days ago that it was hardly an exaggeration to say that they had been producing a fresh range every day since the year came inIt may be&apos; that herein lies the  explanation of the recent shortage of business.    Buyers have, perhaps, been given such a choice in material, style and design that they have been too bewildered to come to any decision.    How deep is the sigh when the manufacturer recalls those days when it was merely a ques tion of Gibson, Oxford or bar and black or brown.    But there seems no escape for him from the present position&apos;.&quot;That business in Northampton is unequally distributed is well demonstrated by the face that while some factories closed for an unusually long period at Easter, others -. unfortunately, a minority - resumed work after an interval of only two or three &quot;days.    A number of firms were pressed for deliveries right up to the time of closing, and the slight improvement experienced during recent weeks will, it is expected, be maintained.    There are a few good orders in hand for summer shoes, and satisfactory activity is reported In regard to sports shoes and women1s high grade footwear....&quot;employment than at the beginning of the month, but that was about 713,800 less than a year ago.MR. WALTER SMITH:    Is there any significance in the fact that the numbers have decreased more in regard to women and children than in regard to men, or does that merely mean to apply to the industries that they are employed in?MR. HYLTON:    The increased   employment amongst women is due to the improvement in the textile industries.    The juveniles are of course affected very much by the end of the school term - that gives us great fluctuations in our juvenile figures.
Bristol8&quot;Easter trade is reported to have been fairly good so far as the demand for women&apos;s shoes is concerned.    In some cases work was resumed in the light shoe factories on Tuesday, and generally there are indications of continued activity in this centre.Dull calf appesrs to be one of the most favoured leathers in the orders coming to hand.    Other popular leathers are tan kid, patent and&quot;willow oalf.    There is also a steady call for reptile skin footwear.There was no improvement in the general demand for leather before the holiday,    kost merchants neve, however, orders in hand for early delivery.&quot;RETAIL TRADE .SIR FOODLAK BURBIDGE sent the following re port:-The usual table for February trade&quot;  shows that,  as compared with last year, sales declined by 6.1?! and the value of stocks  (at cost) by 8.9&quot;&quot;.    As I reported to the Council last month, the table is now becoming much more representative of retail trade as a whole, as the figures include the results of several important multiple branch org anies/tions as well as those of the departmental stores.    Unfortunately, owing to difficulty in getting comparable figures,  the table does not include the results of the co-operative societies-, but I understand that they will be incorporated in the Larch Report&apos;&quot; .    In particular, the figures are now much more representative with regard to the distribution of food, and. the fact that the value of food sales was down by 7.2?? had an appreciable influence on the final result.During the same period the cost of living., index figure for all items fell by 6.8?&apos;,  the corresponding falls for food and clothing alone being 10,if.&apos; and 6.9?-, respectively.    It may be assumed, therefore, that the aggregate quantity of goods sold was at least as much as in February last year.    At the sare time, trade in February was exceptionally quiet, and, after the good results shown in January, somewhat disappointing.I have the corresponding figures of departmental store results for the United States and Germany.    According to the preliminary report of the Federal Reserve Board,  sales in the departmental stores throughout America fell during: February by 9/-, and, in Germany,  according, to the Instut fur Konjunkturf orschung.,  sales were down by no less than 17 .1 y.. These figures compare with the results in Great Britain for departmental stores alone, which show that sales fell by no more than 5 .lf: as compared with February 19?0.    Once more, therefore, departmental store trade in this country appears to have been affected to a smaller extent than in the other countries nared.-&quot;-The tables for March have now been received but are not-reproduced as they appear in the Board of Trade Journal for April 30th, page 559.
The preliminary figures for March trade oonxirm tne anticipation that results, would he generally favourable,  and an increase in sales of possibly 5% may be looked for.      Trading conditions,  assisted by favourable weather,  certainly improved considerably, but unfortunately the results cannot be taken wholly at their face value owing to the disturbance in statistical comparisons which is again caused by the variation in the date of Easter.      This year, March had the advantage of practically the whole of tho pre-Saster trade, which last year, owing to a late Easter, fell into April.     No true&apos; comparison can be obtained,  therefore, until the April figures are available and the results for March and April looked at together, Thus, the April figures are already beginning to feel the effects of the comparison with the higher prices and the pre-Saster trade in April last year.SHIPPING.SIR ERNEST GLOVER handed in the following tables; -Index Number of Ship-ping Freights.,1920 * 100 1913 s 100Maroh 1931 ...............19.68 84,10February 1931.............. 19.33 82., 61March 1930................. 18.15. 77a56Tonnage under Construction.Quarter ended Gt.

GOGDENOUG-H sent the following reportSome improvement in the monetary outlook and foreign exchange position has taken place during the past month. The policy of making the official discount rate effective has been continued,  and the Bank of England has been able to secure gold in the open market after an interval of about twelve months.      By April 8th,  the stock of gold in the Issue Department had increased to  146 millions, as compared with  141 millions a month ago,  and with  139 millions,  the lowest point touched during the preceding twelve months. The Bank of England, however, has found it necessary, at times, to pay more than bhe statutory price to secure-gold. The depreciation of the French franc has continued and the quotation is no?/ far removed from the level at which profitable gold from London can take place.      On theother hand,  the United States dollar has shown little alteration and the possibility of shipments of open market gold to that country rzay have necessitated the payment by the Bank of England of the higher price for gold as above-mentioned.As usual at this season, the collection of taxes reduced the resources of the Money Market, the position being accentuated by the higher rates imposed in last year&apos;s Budget. The market has had recourse to the Bank of England for funds and money rates have been kept definitely firm.      The Easter Holiday period has created the usual demand for currency and this has tended to increase the shortage of market supplies. The quotation for three months&apos; fine Banic bills has been around 2f per cent,  for the past few weeks.On the Stock Exchange,  most gilt-edged securities have somewhat appreciated in price, biit business generally has been r estrie bod.SIR GUY GRANET sent the following report:-Except during the period Maroh 19th to 27th Call Money has been in short supply during the past month.      The end of March was a time of great stringency in consequence of the heavy payments for Treasury Bills to fall due at the-IS-
end of June,  and also withdrawals from the market by the big Banks who were calling funds to send to their provincial branches in connection with their Easter holiday requirements,   J and the Money Market was consequently obliged to borrow from the Bank of England for a week.     It was not able to repay 1the whole of the loans when they became due, and it was therefore necessary to renew a small proportion for another week.     At the moment the market is not indebted to the Bank and it is expected that conditions will be more comfortable for a time.     Although money has been rather scarce the Bank nss not been able to maintain the Market Discount rate at 2f%, but has, with the exception of a short period around the end of March, succeeded in establishing a minimum buying rate of 2 9/16%.     To effect this basis has been rather difficult owing to the reduced supplies of both Commercial and Treasury Bills.     This level has, however, sufficed to attract both American and Continental funds with the result that the principal Foreign Exchanges, and particularly the French Exchange, have been favourable to sterling to the extent that the Bank of England was on 17th March able to acquire gold by purchase in the open market for the first time for nearly a year, and during the past month has increased its holding by about  6,000,000, It is to be hoped that it will be able to continue increasing its holding as at present it is about  12,000,000 less than it was at this time last year.     Incidentally our gold stock is less than one quarter that of the United States Federal Reserve Banks, and less than one third of that of the Bank of France, and it is therefore desirable that the London Discount Rate should not be allowed to fall.to a level which would not be attractive to New York and Paris, as the improvement in the exchange situation is not due to the normal influence of international trade, but is based on the attraction of our rates to foreign financial interests.In the Stock Exchange business has been quiet and quotations have been rather irregular.     In the gilt edge market prices have been fairly well maintained.     Home Rails have been very dull and prices have continued to droop. Industrials have also generally speaking been a quiet market and under the influence of numerous declarations of reduced dividends.&apos; Although the amount in respect of Nevr Issues of capital for trade and industrial purposes shows a slight increase on the previous months the results have not been very encouragingP     For instance, although the offer of 6s% debentures by the Bankers Industrial Development Company on behalf of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation was made at 97? it met with practically no response on the part of the public, and 96% of the issue was left on the hands of the underwriters.WOOL.MR, HAMILTON handed in the following report:-This is usually a period of industrial activity when, in normal circumstances, increased machinery output is to be expected.     There has, this year, been a slight increase averaging 2-g-.&amp;, but this percentage is well below the normal increase.     As far as the Bradford trade is concerned, the
recent improvement in the spinning section has now extended to weaving.      Taking the Vest Riding generally trade is also rather better,  the increased activity affecting particularly the blanket and flannel trades.      In the latter article there has been a strong demand for &quot;athletic&quot; goods - white and grey flannels.With regard to the price of raw materials,  a striking feature of the past month has been the rapid increase in wool prices.     After a slump lasting nearly three years,  and reaching its lowest point towards the end of January, prices rose with rapidity and the Wool Sales which opened in London on March 10th, registered a rise varying from 2hp to 40%. This rise continued to about the middle of the month,  since which time prices have been stationary but firm.Imports of woollen and worsted goods into this country still continue on a large scale.     During March 4 million square yards were imported from the Continent,  as against 3.2 millions in February,  and 3.85 millions in March 1930. Exports for the past 3 months compare very unfavourably with those of the corresponding period of 1930, the reduction being approximately 11 million square yards.Unemployment in the Textile Industry of the West Riding was 38,000 as compared with 41,000 in February.      It is satisfactory to record that the wages dispute in the dyeing section has been peaceably settled on the basis of a reduction in wages of approximately b%,EMPLOYMENT IN MARCH,   1951. MR, HILTON handed in the following report and tables:-There was some further fluctuation during March in the numbers on the registers of Employment Exchanges which resulted in a net decrease during the month of 53,544,     At 3rd march, the total was 2,634,574.      In the following week there was a rise of about 57,000 followed by two successive falls of 52,000 and 59,500.      In the last week of the month, however,  there was a further small rise of 900 to a total of 2,531,030.The net fall of 53,544 during the month was accounted for by a decrease of^N-TV&quot;1^ in the numbers wholly unemployed, and o in the numbers temporarily stopped,\,oSU-The number of men on the Register decreased by 18,873, the number of women decreased by 31,973 and the number of juveniles decreased by 10,698,In every Division except Wales (where there was a continuous decrease)  the numbers unemployed fluctuated during the month and the net variations were as follows:-London, South Eastern and South Western  .....32,854Midlands  ......,.............................* 19,856North Eastern ................................-    1,207North Western............................... - 22, 315Scotland ....................................3,757Wales ........................................r 12,76?The total number of insured persons in employment at 23rd March,  1931,  is estimated provisionally to be about 42,300 more than at 23rd February but about 713,800 less than at R4th March, 1930.

SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR, FOLLSTT HOLT handed in the following Report dated 15th April:-H.R.H. The Prince of Wales is on the voyage home after greatly to our National advantage, visiting Peru, Bolivia, Chili, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil,      The prince interviewed all the important persons who could in any way influence trade with the Empire and particularly encouraged the members of our Chambers of Commerce to strain every nerve in favour of our trade.     The success of the British Empire Exhibition which he opened in Buenos Aires a month ago has been in a great measure due to his encouragement and presence.      It is to close on the 27th instant, and how the good work is to be followed up for the best in individual cases and by collective effort is a matter of deep concern.ARGENTINA.Business movement in general during the month of February was small and uneventful, but there is a slightly increasing tendency in exports of grain, wool and hides at the present time.      Though imports have diminished and higher Customs Duties have been imposed recently, it is believed that the general outlook as regards British exports to Argentina is gradually improving.Economical disposal of the cereal crops is the most pressing export problem, and the Provisional Government, through its representatives abroad, is exploring fresh outlets.They have also considered and practically approved of a scheme for erecting about 600 grain elevators throughout the Country - the work to be carried out by a Canadian firm.A recent Report bearing indirectly on Argentine trade was that relating to the Rome wheat Conference.    The general consensus of opinion was that it was undesirable and almost impossible to impose an artificial reduction of area under wheat cultivation.      The Russian delegate stated in respect of restricted production that Russia &quot;refused emphatically to undertake any obligations whatever in this respect&quot;.The grain market has recently been demoralised and badly broken by Russia coming out with heavy offerings and heavy consignments.The annual Report just issued by the London Central Markets regarding the London Meat Trade is of interest.      Of the total weight of meat imported,  i.e. 461,091 tons,  the South American contribution amounted to 222,604 tons, made up as follows:-Argentina............  200,735 tonsUruguay and Brazil ...    21,949     &quot;222,684 tonsChilled beef from Argentina at a price which suits the average consumer continues to form the bulk of London&apos;s beef supply.The wool, market has shown considerable improvement and prices, though still low, have advanced since the opening of the year.      Of the total of 47,112 bales shipped from Argentina
during February 17,761 bales went to Great Britain, 8,663 to France and 6*341 to the United States of America.CHILE.The  75,000,000 semi-government concern,  the Cia. Salitre de Chile (kncwn as    &quot;Cosach&quot;) has now come into being.      It is felt that the centralisation of the Chilean Hitrate industry-will improve prospects and render it less difficult to come to satisfactory arrangements with the producers of the synthetic article to regulate the world production of this type cf fertilizer.Up to the year 1913, Great Britain had done more then any other foreign Country to develop Chile&apos;s resources, and was able to supply goods to that Country on a basis of price and quality which left little room for competition.      The following comparative figures of imports to Chile, from the three leading-Countries to supply,  tell their own tale as regards the position at the present time;-Year. British Empire. U. S. A. Germany.1913........ 359. 17$ 25$1920 ........ 31$ 51$ 5$1925........ 27$ 27% 11%&apos; 1929 ......., 21% 52% 15$1930 ........ 18% 33$ 17$The figures of Exports from Chile to the same three Countries are equally significant:-Year.

The weight cf the taxes removes doubt as to their object;    the question of protection would,  in most cases, be met by smaller increases to the existing tariffs or even by retaining the status quo.URUGUAY.A Special Committee, under the Ministry of Finance, hasbeen studying the urgent problem of ^a^^^c^mgoc and nas Government expenditure in 1920-21 totalled -^,000,000 and nas been steadily increasing annually, until a figure of MWCO,WO was reached in 1929-30.      The estimates for 195G-31 amount  12,500,000During the year 1930, 981,068 head of ****** Jgf2sheep were sold in the Montevideo Cattle Market.      These figures . show an increase over the year 1929.

The Decree authorising the Brazilian Government to purchase stocks of coffee existing as at 30th June next has not met with universal approval The planters rbject to the proposed tax in kind and the tax of 3/ per bag transported as from 1st July next, contending that as the Coffee Institute was in reality a Government Department and as such accumulated huge stocks in the regulating warehouses, the Government should purchase these stocks at a price which would show no loss to the planter.An embargo has been placed on the importation.of industrial machinery or apparatus for industries suffering from over-production.     The industries which the Government has chiefly in view are the textiles.     A few years ago these were showing profits so large that many new mills were installed and existing mills largely extended.     There are now fully 350 mills,  equipped with nearly 80,000 looms and 2,500,000 spindles.     Their output is estimated at about 600,000,000 metres, of which very little is exported.     Practically all varieties of materials are made,  and from 80 to 90 per cent of the home demand is supplied.The total industrial production of Brazil is well over.  200j,000,000 annually, and embraces a large range of products. Besides textiles, which comprise cotton, linen, wool, siMc and jute goods, the footwear industry produces over 30,000,000 pairs of boots and shoes;   hats total 10,000,000;    the tobacco and match factories produce over 200,000,000 cigars,450,000,000 packets of cigarettes, and 1,000,000,000 boxes of matches. Perfumery and pharmaceutical articles each amount to 60,000,000. These represent only some of the more common industries established in all the more populous centres in Brazil.COLOMBIA.Trade is somewhat restricted,  though a spirit of some optimism prevails.      The passing of the new oil and railway Laws has laid the way open for further loan negotiations with the Banking syndicate,.which has been assisting the Government recently.The Colombian Government have signed a contract with the South American Gulf Oil Company, for the exploitation of what has been known as the &quot;Barco Concession&quot;, a vast oil-bearing region near the Venezuelan border.      The signing of this contract is regarded very favourably in the United States of America.-
The 1930 coffee crop was the largest ever produced in Colombia, and notwithstanding the serious fall in prices the value obtained was only a little less than that of the previous year, being  14,400,000 against  15,600,000.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR CYRIL HURCOHB    sent the following report:-During the five weeks ended 5th April,  1931, the railway traffic receipts of the four amalgamated companies^ were  1,395,000 less than in the corresponding period of 1930.

These shew that the number of passengers (excluding season ticket holders) conveyed over all standard gauge railways in Great Britain,  except the London Tubes and Metropolitan -District Railway, was 5,259,781, or 7.2 per cent,  less than in the corresponding period of 1930.     Passengers conveyed at standard ordinary fares decreased by 2,008,898 (11.7 per cent.; and those conveyed at workmen&apos;s fares by 2,572,553 (11.5 per cent.).The tonnage of freight traffic in January,  1931, was 5,739,376 tons lesc than in the corresponding period of 1930, a reduction of 19.4 per cent.

LENNOX LEE sent the following reportThe trend of the raw cotton markets during the month has had an adverse influence upon the remainder of the Industry. The publication of the International Cotton Federation&apos;s statistics for the first half of the season, showing a consumption of only 5,278,000 bales of American Cotton,  came as a reminder that there had been no solid grounds for the recovery in prices which commenced in January,     At the beginning of the month the spot price of Middling American at Liverpool was 6.15 but since March 16th it has remained below 6d,     The announcement on March 23rd that the Farm Board would discontinue the use of Government funds to stabilise wheat led to expectations that similar action would be taken with regard to cotton and this belief has undoubtedly had its effect in checking the return of confidence and in causing buyers of yarn and cloth to operate with great caution.     The weakness in American Cotton prices has been reflected in the markets for the Egyptian staple which, notwithstanding the bad news of the Sudan crop, have been notably devoid of support.News received during the month of additional tariffs in several important overseas markets has added to the difficulties of the industry.     Details were announced of higher tariffs on cotton goods, which came into operation in Egypt and in Argentina towards the end of February and notice was received that the Swiss Tariff would be raised as from March 10th.   - Added to these came the announcement of a 5% increase in Import Duties on cotton goods entering India.Conditions in the principal markets have not materially changed.     Picketing still continues in India and this,  together with the additional tariffs, is seriously hampering business. It is not surprising,  therefore,  to learn that certain well known importers who have Mill interests in India are giving up their import business and devoting themselves entirely to the home productions.
1 K 11)More enquiry from China was noticeahle at the beginning of the month but it did not lead to any amount of business,,     Sfgypt and the Near East,, in similar manner, seemed more promising in the first half but fell away before the close of the period0     Very little improvement has taken place in the South American markets. The rise in the value of the Argentine Peso is, however, expected to assist importers but against this the large increase in commercial failures is a serious handicap.     Conditions in Brazil have worsened in consequence of the depreciation of the Milreis.     Reports from Chili and Colombia indicate very little change although the prospects appear to be somewhat better than they were a month ago.In the Finishing Section of the trade orders for the overseas markets have been disappointing and the amount of plant employed, has been distinctly sub-normal.     The firms that have been fairly well employed are mostly engaged on speciality business and there are no signs of any improvement in the trade generally.NON-FERROUS METALS. CAPTo LYTTLETON sent the following report.-Copper.Consumers appear to be well covered and the demand is still disappointing.     We hear of a slightly better demand for Sulphate in Widnes, but little progress in the Sheet and Rod business0 Conditions have generally been quiet under the influence of the Easter holidays and the end of the financial year0Tin.Birmingham report slight improvement in demand for the Home trade but little enquiry for export,  end Swansea state that the trade is still working under 50$,  though there has been a better enquiry for Tinplates and makers seem to anticipate an improvement shortly,,.     The market here has been stimulated by lower ,/prices and a fair volume of business has resulted,,Lead.Sales and enquiries have shown a rather better tendency and demand was.perhaps 10$ better than last month.      In Liverpool we hear that all sections of the trade have bought for delivery well into May,  and one cable maker reports that several enquiries from local authorities are under discussion and that one . or two orders have actually been placed within the last few days.      In Birmingham on the other hand demand has fallen off again and enquiries are very few.Spelter.Birmingham report that a fair amount of metal is being delivered to works against previous orders and   a slight improvement is looked for in the galvanised hollow-ware trade next month, but firms generally are fairly well covered.     In Swansea several works which closed for the holidays have not re-opened, and only 200 tons were purchased in the last fortnight.      In Liverpool on the other hand there has been a big improvement in sales to galvanisers, both of Refined and G.O.B., but it is doubtful whether this reflects any genuine improvement in conditions.
OOAL.It is difficult to write anything new as to the position in the Coal Trade, which,  in common with most other&apos; Trades,  is suffering from the effect of the &quot;World slump,.      However,  so far as the North-East coast is concerned,  there are one or two points which I have referred to on -previous occasions which might very well he emphasized again.      The first is the strength of Steam CoalSo     B.C.3. Steams are now selling at sixpence above the limitation price.      The cause of this is the great demand for the Coast, and for Bunkering Trawlers..      As previously explained, this has come about through the great demand from Grimsby district,  owing to the working of the quota system in the Midlands, which has been, and is still, preventing tbe Trawlers from receiving adequate supplies of Midland Coal.With respect to Durham Steam,  this quality of Coal has received a great impetus through the placing of orders for about 100,000 tons by the Danish State Railways.The demand for Coking Coals has temporarily improved, and is enabling some of the Collieries to work full, time.In reading through the March reports which have come to me as President of the Chambers of Commerce,although the different Trades to which I shall refer will undoubtedly be reported by the accredited representatives, I think I might call your attention to one or two paragraphs:-COTTON.Bombay Millowners make no secret of their aspirations to replace Lancashire goods by their own products,  and a corporation has been formed in Bombay during the month to take over all stocks of foreign cotton goods in Bombay from the Dealers, with a view to disposal by Export.      It is hoped that the improved feeling in India might lead to some revival in demand from that country, but so far,  this has not materialised. The world wide tendency towards a narrow nationalism (of which many British interests are strong supporters) leads to outcries against the import of &quot;foreign11 material, and this is still hindering the recovery of our Indian trade.PRICES,The rise which had taken place in the Wholesale prices of provisions during February, was, generally speaking, not only-no t maintained, but showed an actual reduction in March.      To mention one commodity only - BUTTER - Danish declined about 15/-per cwt. New Zealand and Australian declined between 7/- and 8/- per cwt.      Swedish also declined 8/- per cwt.SHIPREP AIRING- both on the East and West coasts,  continues in a very serious condition.SIR WALTER RAINE sent the following reports-

MR. .VARLEY sent the following report and tables:-The Co-operative Movement South of the Tweed is still shewing decreases in cash received, but lncieases in v,eight of goods delivered.     The only considerable decreases in weights are in Tea aj*d Tobacco, which are 6 per cent and 9 per cent decrease respectively.In Sugar, Butter, Flour, Bacon, Hams and Grain considerable increases in weight are shown, although there are decreases In cash received.The comparisons between wholesale and retail prices are coming more into line with each other, for instance, the wholesale price of Sugar during the twelve months has decreased 10.58%, Butter 15.31%, Flour 38.86%, Bacon 40.29%, Lard 8.24$ and Cheese 13.65^&apos;.The retail price of Sugar has decreased 8.33%&quot;, Butter I3.6470, Flour 33.33%, Bacon 33.33%, Lard 11.11% and Cheese 11.11%.The Butter trade has ruled steady and in the North Empire Butter has increased gc? far as our sales are concerned for the month by 4,543 cwts.,-mostly New Zealand.There Is still a substantial margin In values, Danish being cheaper by 33s.6d and Australian by 23s.6d as compared with a year ago.Wheat is 3d to   6d per quarter lower on the month, and exporting countries are not finding as much demand from importer as they would like.      The law of supply and demand is in favour of the buyer.      In Canada they are fighting hard to maintain prices but are having to bear the cost of carrying Wheat in interest charges and warehouse costs.     The holding policy has resulted in serious losses.In the U.S.A. the Farm Board is now trying to sell its holdings.      The policy announced is that no further support will be given to the market for the new crop when harvesting begins    in June,     European buyers are not interested in U.S.A. Wheat.Russia is selling steadily and shipping to many European ports.     They show more readiness to meet buyers&apos; views in regard to prices as compared with North America.In Australia good supplies are available, but the financial conditions compel selling policy to meet the market.In India efforts are being made to put a tariff on to prevent Australian Wheat competing with native grown.Argentine is meeting the market and selling all the time.South America gets on with the business, while North America works hard to maintain the price.An extremely heavy crop of Maize is available in the Argentine and supplies should be cheap and plentiful in Europe during the next six months.
Barley.- Good supplies are available from many directions, Russia &quot;&quot;taking most of the trade and meeting the market at low-prices.Oats.- World supplies are heavy, the demand being small and prices low.Milling Offals are none too plentiful, due to the millers mutual policy of restricting the output of flour to the demand. The result has proved satisfactory to our Corn Mills during the last month.The Drapery, woollens, Boots and Furnishing Departments are all complaining of lack of trade.      There is no great amount of confidence.In household coal,  so far as we are concerned, the difficulties occasioned by the- operation of the Quota are being overcome by buying in areas away from our own immediate district and getting supplies for our members.Wo have exported the usual miscellaneous supplies of small values of goods to other co-operative organisations in different parts of the World, our exports to Russia amounting to  154,000.LIST OF SALES BY THE RUSSIA GRAIN EXPORT ASSOCIATION.Sales made since last Board Meeting 9ph .Mar^^l951.Wheat ..........,.............. 45,939 TonsBarley ........................ 3,100Oats.......................... 15,017Maize.......................... 934Peas .......................... 53Lentils ....................... 338Cottonseed .................... 3,000Sunflower Oil  ................. 1,000Total ....... 747471 TonsGRAND TOTAL SALES TO DATE FROM 1ST JULY 1930.CommodityContractj   ShippedContracts Unshipped,Wheat.................   11,234,322Barleyj Oats................\ Maize    ...........Peas ................i Glucose  .............&apos; Cotton Cake s ......i Linseed Cakes.......1 Sunflower Cakes.....i Lentils .............i CastorseedI Cottonseed ..........I Soya Beans ..........i Cotton Oil  ..........i Sunflower.oil .......!

COLONIAL TRADE,MR. VSRNON sent the latest available trade statistics for various Colonies of which a summary is shown below.      It will be observed that comparing last year with 1929 there has been throughout a heavy decrease in exports (by value) and a somewhat smaller decrease In imports.      In the case of Ceylon In which a comparison is made between January this year and January last year, however, imports have fallen more than exports.     There has, of course, been a large fall in values since 1929.It;ls satisfactory to note that where figures are available they show that the proportion of Colonial imports supplied from this country is well maintained.Exports...............                   i                            ! ;        1929.		1930.

Manufacturers - report some improvement in the Home trade compared with a month ago.     This is   atrributed partly to the Easter trade and partly to the advance in wool prices, which have given more confidence-.
lb 1The demand for novelties in fancy outerwear remains fairly good, although there is not the rush that might he expected at this time of the year.      In the Underwear trade there is a fair demand.There is no doubt that the adverse effect of the large importations of foreign hosiery for some time past is still being felt.Loughborough.    Trade in this district is reported to be very bad,&quot;&quot;- about the same as last month, but worse than a year ago.      Short time is still being worked.Nottingham.       The increase in Wool prices is presumably mainly responsible for tho stimulated buying by the wholesale trade, and considerable orders have been placed, particularly for the Autumn requirements.      Stocks of Underwear appear to have been low, and buying for this section has been considerable.Eagter coming early has resulted in rather less trade for that season than usual, and the volume of business passing for immediate requirements is rather restricted.      There is, however, a better feeling in the industry.The export trade Is poor at the moment.Hinckley, Mansfield,   Hawick.    Reports from these districts are thaTT^Thore is no change in the conditions of  last month.IRON AND STEEL.The following report and table was handed in by MR. WALMSLFY:-The production figures for March which have just become available  seem to confirm the suggestion that the industry is &quot;bumping along the bottom&quot; but there are few indications of a permanent upward movement.      Production of pig iron in March amounted to 357,100 tens which, although about 40,000 tons more than in February, represents approximately the same daily rate. Production in March was only 54 per cent of the output in March 1930.      The number of furnaces In blast at the end of  the month was 81, the same as at the end of February.     There is possibly a better feeling in the hematite section of tho trade and there is some talk of the possibility of re-starting two furnaces on hematite iron next month on the North East Coast.It cannot be said that there is any material change in the prospects of the industry and reports received from makers do not give hope of an early revival.      No enquiries are passing for any large tonnages and consumers do not show any inclination to enter into forward contracts.     The railway companies have placed orders which will help to keep going for some time a few of  the rail mills y/hich would otherwise have had to cease dperations.      In other branches specifications are scarce especially in shipbuilding material.     The tonnage on the order books is below that on hand at the end of the previous month.
Little signs of improvement are forthcoming from Ohina, Australia and India and it is unlikely that these countries, which are usually good buyers, will return to the market with anything like normality for some time to come.TABLE.
