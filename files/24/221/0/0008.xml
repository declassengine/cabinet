(P.) 11.)CABINET.THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff dealing with the general situation in regard to air armaments. This has been prepared in accordance with the conclusion reached at our first meeting, and in a series of appendices will be found a mass of detailed information as to first-line strengths, expenditure and similar matters which I trust will meet the Committee&apos;s requirements.I do not think I need add anything at this stage beyond inviting special attention to a most important point made by the Chief of the Air Staff, and that is that the geography of the British Commonwealth imposes on us a number of serious handicaps in the matter of air disarmament. I may perhaps illustrate my meaning by quoting from the singularly apt remarks made by the French representative at Geneva on the defects of schemes of mathematical parity, or of disarmament based on existing strengths, at the time when the Soviet proposals were under discussion in the Spring of 1929.M. Massigli said :  &apos;&apos; We do not live above the earth, and we must take the situation of countries into account. Let us suppose you have two countries with identical forces. One has extensive and open frontiers, its vital centres, its industries are all situated near the frontier. Another has strong natural defences, and its vital centres and industries are far from the frontier. It has time and consequently space in its favour. In fixing the armaments of these two States, ought we not to take these different situations into account? Have we any right to apply mathematics and mathematics alone f I cannot think so, and I venture to say that the Commission has not thought so either.&quot; [5355] &apos;.    b
That is a crucial feature of our air problem. Time and space are against us. We. are more dependent on air power than any other nation and have made and are making a far fuller use of it. Yet so earnestly have we pursued the path of disarmament and so consistently moderate has been our policy that we, who in November 1918 were fast overtaking France, and on the eve of possessing the strongest air force in the world, alike in respect of quality and quantity, actually rank to-day, in terms of first-line strength, fifth of the world&apos;s Air Powers. And it must not be forgotten that, perhaps more than with any other arm, success or defeat in air warfare is likely to depend on immediate capacity for action, i.e., on peace strengths : in the absence of fully adequate air defences there will be neither time nor opportunity to mobilise the natiohs war resources at leisure.(Initialled) A.Air Ministry, April 27, 1931.
THE GENERAL SITUATION IN RESPECT OF AIR ARMAMENTS.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.1. I HAVE not attempted in this appreciation to deal with the political factors which have affected the formation of the air forces of foreign countries.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has in D.C. (P.) 3 called attention to the major military problems of Europe, and it is generally true that in the case of most European States the considerations underlying air development are broadly similar to those affecting land armaments.Accordingly, I will confine myself mainly to a recital of facts, commenting on strategical air factors only where they appear to merit separate treatment.I include in the body of my remarks a short statement of the history of the growth of air armaments since the war and the effect of this growth upon the security of the British Commonwealth. Finally, I give a brief summary of the factors which seem to me of particular importance in relation to air disarmament.In the Appendices will be found a short note comparing fighting efficiency in the more important air forces, and statistics of personnel and material, together with some explanatory notes on organization and equipment.2. Before 1914, and during the early stages of the war, aircraft had scarcely emerged from the experimental stage and their employment for military purposes was confined almost entirely to observation and reconnaissance duties.As they increased in numbers, range and carrying power, the possibilities of the air arm as a striking force became gradually apparent. Indeed, since 1916 there has been a steady and progressive development of specialised types for attack of objectives on land and sea and for the destruction of opposing aircraft, in addition to those required for reconnaissance and observation purposes.In the earlier stages of this second phase of development, bombing aircraft were generally regarded more or less as long range artillery to be directed against the army or navy of the enemy, giving an increase of range of a few score miles, but suffering as a weapon from comparative inaccuracy and undue dependence on the vagaries of wind and weather.During the middle and concluding periods of the war, however, these handicaps were in process of being overcome and the air forces of the belligerents demonstrated in no uncertain manner, though still under limitations imposed by the embryonic state of technical development and strategical thought, the moral and material potentialities of air power as a primary instrument of war.Thus it is that we find to-day air disarmament a major problem in itself, whereas 15 years ago it would have been merely a corollary to the limitation and reduction of armies and navies.3. At the end of the last war came a period of stagnation, and even of reaction, in air development.The Peace Treaty disposed of the air forces of the Central Powers, and, in prohibiting absolutely their future maintenance, bore witness to the potentialities of the air arm even as it existed in 1919.Great Britain, which at the time of the Armistice had a first-line strength of 3,300 aeroplanes and was rapidly overtaking even the French in numbers as it had already surpassed them in technical efficiency, virtually &quot;scrapped&quot; its air force. The U.S.A. and Italy also reduced to a small fraction of their former strength. Russia was able neither to manufacture nor to purchase air material, and the newly formed European nations had not as yet turned their attention to the possibilities of the new arm.There was little to indicate to a war-weary and preoccupied world that the roots of air power were left in the soil and would presently produce the abundant growth that now calls urgently for the pruning knife.[5355] r 2
France and Air Disarmament.4. Alone among the countries that were Air Powers in 1918, France had remained relatively strong during the disarmament period immediately following the war. The strength of her air forces at home never fell below 940 first-line aircraft in addition to the units maintained in her colonies.France&apos;s action in maintaining this force (less than one-third of which was strictly ancillary to her army) has had far-reaching results for ourselves, and upon the French must rest responsibility for the situation which confronts us to-day, though other Powers have in recent years emulated her example.With the signing of the Peace Treaty, Britain had hoped for such real disarmament as would have permanently removed any serious air menace to these islands and to our sea-borne trade, and would have relieved us of the need for providing anything beyond the air forces required overseas, the army co-operation squadrons and the fleet air arm, together with a few squadrons in reserve for use in such small wars as our expeditionary force might have to undertake.This hope was never realised. France, convinced that overwhelming air superiority would enable her to smash the industrial resources of the Ruhr and hold up the German army should it ever undertake a race for the bridgeheads of the Rhine, increased her forces instead of reducing them. In consequence, by 1923 a general recrudescence of air armaments had set in the world over.The Post-War Growth of Air Armaments.5. To appreciate the extent of the growth of air armaments generally throughout the world between 1922 and the present date, it is only necessary to consider the first-line aeroplane strengths in the case of certain foreign Powers, excluding France.Between 1922 and 1930 there were the following increases :  U.S.A. Italy  ... Czecho Slovakia Roumania Japan...From 480 to 1,052 in 8 years.From 100 From 160 to From   40 toto 1,002 in 8 years. 270 in 8 years. 200 in 3 years.From 339 to   418 in 4 years.No information as to the early strengths of Poland and Jugd Slavia is available, but from the smallest beginnings these new countries have now l cached totals of 384 and 340 respectively. Russia, whose air force was negligible in 1922, now boasts a strength of 1,040 aircraft, constituting a force which not only makes the running for the minor nations of Eastern Europe, but is a potential threat to British interests from the Khyber to Mosul.The statistics for air expenditure during the last six years are also illuminating. A comparison of the total gross expenditure in 1925 with that of 1931 in the case of four major air Powers, excluding Russia, for which no data are available, gives the results shown in the table below.(The expenditure on civil aviation, which has featured largely in disarma-ment discussions at Geneva, is included, since it is impossible in most cases to disentangle it from the military budget.)-f or - of 193 L on 1925. Country. Per cent.Great Britain... ... ... ...      -   1FranceItalyU.S.A.+ 138 -f 37 + 159Nor, unfortunately, has the growth of air armaments yet run its course. Almost all Powers have expansion programmes of formidable proportions awaiting either the consolidation of the existing framework or the provision of the necessary funds for new construction. Thus Italy proposes an increase of 80 per cent, above her present strength, Jugo Slavia 55 per cent., Japan 42 per cent., U.S.A. 32 per cent, and Czechoslovakia no less than 270 per cent.It can scarcely cause surprise if Germany, with 1,000 aircraft on her Western frontier and 1,200 in the countries under French influence in Eastern Europe (to
say nothing of the prospect that these latter forces may be doubled) feels entitled to protest that the promises of disarmament have been ignored and to seek ways and means, in Eussia and elsewhere, of mitigating the dangers of her position.Even after due allowance is made for the element of bluff which undoubtedly inflates the future programmes of the smaller Powers, it is patent that the &apos;&apos; race for armaments,&quot; as far as air forces are concerned, is a menace of extreme gravity to the world&apos;s peace.The Air Problems of Great Britain.6. So much for the consideration of past expansion and the possibilities of future growth. The present position of this country in relation to world air armaments merits closer analysis, and I proceed to mention the factors which mainly affect the military as opposed to the political aspects of disarmament.For this purpose it is unnecessary to deal in detail with the air forces of minor European nations which, though they constitute serious potential problems for one another, cannot be regarded as exercising any appreciable direct influence upon British policy.The air forces which directly affect us are those of France, Italy, Russia, Japan and the U.S.A., and information as to their equipment, organization and potential fighting strength have been included in the Appendices to this paper.7. Led by the hope, already referred to, that the years succeeding the war would see real disarmament in Europe, we had by 1923 drifted into an intolerable situation vis-a-vis the French, who then had over a thousand aircraft in France while we could muster but 36 for home defence.The risks involved in exposure to air attack are such that the defence problem cannot be solved, as it may be in the case of ground forces, by the maintenance of small covering forces behind which the main body of the defence can be mobilized after the emergency has arisen. The effects of large-scale air attack are likely to be direct and instantaneous.However much we might believe that the French force was maintained for security and not aggression, we could not continue indefinitely to depend entirely on the goodwill of our neighbours.The National and Imperial Defence Committee, which reviewed the whole problem of Imperial Defence in 1923, were profoundly impressed with the gravity of the position, which they regarded as the outstanding issue of the day. Accordingly, they recommended in a special interim report, after exhaustive enquiry, and the Government approved, the formation of a Home Defence air force of 52 squadrons. The then Prime Minister announced that the provision of this force was a step to be taken &quot; in the first instance &quot; and &quot; with as little delay as possible.&quot;Only 39 of the 52 squadrons have so far been formed, and of these no less than 13 are second-line non-regular units.Our first-line regular units at home muster 400 aircraft, while the corre-sponding strength of France is 990, and this numerical inferiority is enhanced by other factors.The proximity of London to the coast, and the concentration of our national resources in and around it (an authoritative estimate puts this at one-third of our total commercial, financial and industrial wealth), make our Capital highly vulnerable to attack and peculiarly difficult to defend. Time and space at present operate strongly in favour of France as regards the air defence of Paris compared with that of London, and the advantage will lie more and more with France as aircraft develop in speed and operating height.Equality in numbers, therefore, cannot give us equality in effective strength unless we have a large margin of technical superiority.This is not the occasion to dilate upon the consequences to this country that would follow on air attack upon the scale which France could develop and maintain with her forces and ours at their present strengths. I must, however, record my view that, from the strategic as opposed to the political point of view,, the existing position is in effect one of unilateral disarmament which cannot be indefinitely tolerated.
Discussion of the air situation at home has centred so much upon the question of the defence of London and Southern England against air attack that another aspect of our air problem is often overlooked.France has always regarded the submarine as the reply of the weaker naval Powers to the Fleets of the stronger, and there can be no doubt that, if the necessary excuse for unrestricted submarine warfare were forthcoming, she could produce a situation not less serious than that which confronted us at the end of the late war.It is not generally realised that in 1918 we had several hundred aeroplanes, in addition to many light airships, employed on anti-submarine duties round our coasts. At the present time we have only 15 aircraft at home suitable for this-work.It is not claimed that the number of modern specialised aircraft necessary in the early stages of war would approach the figure maintained in 1918, but it appears necessary to draw attention to the very serious potential commitment (having no parallel elsewhere) which exists and to point out that no adequate provision has so far been possible to meet it.8. The position overseas differs radically in several respects from that at home and also from that of other Powers.The extent and scattered nature of the British Commonwealth brings us into touch with the air forces of most of the larger nations. Moreover, we are the pioneers of a system whereby air forces perform indispensable peace-time duties and are not merely superimposed upon a military garrison adequate for all purposes. Further, we are at present unable to reinforce any of our overseas possessions by air from home. But above all we have the essential task of supple-menting the efforts of the older Services to secure the world-wide communications on which we are so much more dependent than any other Power.Our total strength overseas is 249 aircraft, of which 96 are in India. As indicated above, however, air control and security duties in Iraq, Transjordan and Aden, which have, at present, no counterpart in the colonial dependencies of other Powers, limit the availability of 70 of these aircraft for general defence. For purposes of comparison, therefore, our effective strength overseas for general service may be taken as being not much in excess of 179, compared with the French total of 298.This strength must be considered in relation to three main problems :  (a) The security of our communications and bases.(&amp;) The security of our position in the Middle East and our interests in iraq and Persia, (c) The security of India.As regards communications, the position in the Mediterranean is, to say the least, disquieting.Italy could produce an overwhelming scale of air attack against Malta, and France against Gibraltar; and either Power, in addition to making one of these essential bases practically untenable, could inflict serious loss to our shipping in some part of the Mediterranean.France could concentrate large air forces to assist in denying us the use of the West African ports, whose importance would be vastly increased by any diversion of shipping from the Mediterranean to the Cape route.The air defence of the Suez Canal must take into account the existence of the French air force in Syria and that of Italy in Libya, each of which outnumbers the British air forces in Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan.In the Far East the security of Hong Kong may largely depend upon the presence of air forces adequate to counter the already large and rapidly increasing Japanese air force, while at other important Eastern bases there are considerable air defence commitments as yet unfulfilled.As regards Iraq, the Persian Gulf and the North-West Frontier of India, attention must be paid to the growing Russian air force, already over 1,000 strong, which has been sedulously cultivated by the Soviet Government and is believed to have attained considerable proficiency in the offensive role for which it is primarily equipped and trained.  In war between Russia and Great Britain,
-the difficulties of the intervening country for the operation of ground forces in the areas of probable contact would put a premium upon the early employment of -air forces in the greatest possible strength.Without going into details of the possible employment of air forces in any particular situation, it is quite clear that our present air strength overseas, so far from constituting a menace to the interests of any other Powers, is, in fact, altogether inadequate, in the present state of world armaments, for the protection of our own.Some Considerations affecting Disarmament.9. It may not be inappropriate to conclude this review by summarising some of the factors which, as it seems to me, must affect our attitude towards disarmament.In the first place, our requirements at home are largely, though not entirely, relative to the size of continental air forces, particularly that of Prance. The exceptions are the anti-submarine coastal patrol requirements and the strength of the Fleet Air Arm. The former has already been mentioned in paragraph 7-, but the latter, perhaps, requires a few words of elucidation.The Fleet Air Arm has to be included in the metropolitan total if we are to insist (as we must) that the French Army Co-operation aircraft should be included in France&apos;s total. In stating their requirements for the Fleet Air Arm, however, the Admiralty takes account not of France, but of the Naval air forces of the U.S.A., to which the French can be indifferent. Thus a situation might arise where France would be free to use the whole of her army co-operation aircraft in direct attack on this country while a substantial portion of our own &apos;&apos; metropolitan &apos;&apos; strength would be designed for, and employed upon, naval duties unconnected with &apos;&apos; air &apos;&apos; defence.In other words, we cannot be content with a fleet air arm only large enough for purposes of war with France, though to increase it beyond that strength at the expense of land based forces must result in a loss of air security.Secondly, it appears that our overseas quota for limitation must be regarded as entirely independent of the metropolitan total, and will be partly &quot; absolute &quot; and partly relative to the armaments of other powers. The &apos;&apos; absolute &apos;&apos; portion is represented by forces engaged on indispensable peace duties together with the necessary minimum of central reserve for them. The relative portion will be determined by the extent of foreign armaments, naval, military and air, and their potential effect upon the security of our vital communications and other interests.Thirdly, the influence of civil aviation upon air disarmament requires mention. Commercial aircraft of high performance capable of carrying heavy loads over long distances are being continuously developed and produced in increasing numbers. They possess considerable military value for purposes of aggression. Indeed, in the absence of strong forces of purely military types, civil aviation would be a most formidable weapon in the hands of an ill-disposed nation, to which there could be no effective counter. Moreover, a large fleet of civil aircraft results in a powerful aircraft industry able at short notice to produce military types and thus adds greatly to potential military strength. Great Britain is unfortunately situated for the development of civil aviation at home, where distances are too short to enable aircraft to compete effectively with other means of transport, and it is therefore to be expected that the civil air fleets of European Powers will always heavily outnumber our own. Reductions in the military air force available for defence must immediately enhance the potential importance of these commercial aircraft, so much so that it is possible that civil aviation will eventually determine the limits beyond which air disarmament will not be feasible. No country can remain insensible to this consideration, the importance of which in relation to disarmament has indeed already received universal recognition.Fourthly, I think&apos; it necessary to refer to India, though I assume that the Indian Government will formulate separate claims at the Disarmament Conference. India at present absorbs roughly two-fifths of the air forces stationed abroad, but even this high proportion does not suffice for her defence in war or even for dealing with major frontier troubles. The North-West frontier is a liability that may at any time impose a serious drain on our air resources, and
the limitation figures for our &apos;&apos; oversea &apos;&apos; quota must be directly affected by the-claims which India puts forward.Finally, I desire to emphasise my view that the success or failure of air limitation and disarmament mainly depends upon the attitude of France and Russia, the one preponderant in Western and the other in Eastern Europe.Russia may be the more probable enemy, but geographical factors fortunately put limits to the damage that her air forces could inflict upon us in the present state of air development, and consequently our overseas requirements will not be so closely affected by variations, upwards or downwards, in the Russian air strength as will our home requirements by the metropolitan strength of France. Our overseas air problem, as I have already stated, is affected by considerations wider than the air strength of any one Power. Unfortunately, there are no similar geographical limitations to the results which the French could achieve against us at home, even under present conditions, and my view is that the vulnerability of these islands to air attack constitutes, on purely strategical considerations, our weakest point in the whole field of Imperial Defence.His Majesty&apos;s Government, in their desire for disarmament, have in the past taken no small&quot; risk by delaying the inception of their air programme and by thereafter repeatedly slowing it down. I submit that the point at issue is not so much whether Britain can or should build up to the strength of France, but that our security demands effective parity with France. Accordingly, unless the French agree to reduce to our level we must demand limiting figures that will enable us to achieve effective parity despite the handicaps resulting from our dependence upon seaborne trade and from the concentration of our vital resources in a capital that is so highly vulnerable to air attack.(Signed1) J.

APPENDIX II.Short Summary of the Principal Factors affecting the Efficiency of the Air Forces of Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, U.S.A., and Japan.THE statistical data contained in Appendix I have shown that the predominant air power is France and that apart from France larger air services than that of Great Britain are maintained by the United States, Russia, and Italy in the order named. Many of the factors, however, which are relevant to a comparison between the air forces of these countries cannot be expressed in statistical form. The object of the present note is to bring some of these factors briefly under review.(a) Great Britain.It is probable that unit for unit the British air force attains a definitely higher standard of efficiency than the air forces of any other country. Its personnel is of exceptionally good quality- which may be attributed to voluntary enlistment on comparatively long terms of engagement and a high standard of discipline combined with good conditions of pay and maintenance. Further, an important factor is the amount of service in overseas areas, where squadrons have necessarily to be maintained on conditions approaching those of active service. This makes for professional efficiency and esprit de corps, which is more difficult to secure in air services which are more exclusively tied to their own metropolitan areas. On the other hand, the extent of our overseas and naval commitments in relation to the total size of the forces and the fact that in large areas the air force acts as the primary arm of defence without any large supporting body of land! or sea forces, implies a much larger proportionate burden of responsibility than falls to the air service of any other power. Less than 25 per cent., for example, of the first line strength of the French service is stationed abroad, or carried at sea, as compared with the 50 per cent, of our own first line strength which is absorbed by overseas commands or by the allotment to the Fleet Air Arm.(b) France.Conscription brings into the French fighting services many men of the skilled artisan type Avho rarely enlist in the British services, (Skilled tradesmen have to be obtained for the R.A.F. by the recruitment of boy apprentices who are given their technical training within the service, and this system corresponds in general with that by which the Royal Navy had for long recruited its engine room artificers and other technical ratings.) The present period of conscript service (12 months) is, however, too short to enable the French air service to make the best use of such material. It has to be supplemented by personnel who voluntarily serve longer engagements, but there is definite reason to believe that the present standard of maintenance and technical efficiency in the French air force is distinctly lower than that of the British air service. Political disputes, controversies with the Naval and Military authorities in regard to the control of the air service, and financial difficulties have militated against consistency of policy; in matters of technical equipment. Up to the present not only the technical equipment in use, but also the scale of reserves of equipment have been markedly inferior to our own. The French authorities, however, realise their -deficiencies in this respect, and the financial provision for the present year includes a substantial extra budgetary sum for making good their shortages of technical equipment.(c) Italy.Italy&apos;s position as regards reserves of personnel is much the same as obtains in France.  The number of skilled personnel in the reserve is probably inadequate.
There is no doubt that the Italian Air Force has concentrated on the success-ful performance of somewhat spectacular feats to the exclusion of the more prosaic, but none the less essential, details of training and co-operation with the other services, without which no air force can be regarded as efficient.No reserves of aircraft exist, replacements being obtained direct from aircraft factories.While, in Italy, this is a considered policy of economy in peace time, it is probable that in the event of hostilities it would be a matter of grave embarrass-ment.The maintenance organisation, on the whole, is such that it is doubtful whether it would stand the strain of war.While the Italian air force appears likely to be well led! and their conception of the employment of aircraft in war is sound, it is probable that the force as a whole will not be able to translate this correct conception into effective action, nor can the Italian air force be regarded at the moment as such an effective weapon as its numerical strength would appear to indicate.(d) Russia.Information as to the strength and state of development of the Russian air force is scanty, and consequently some of the following information must be accepted with some reserve.Considerable progress has undoubtedly been made during recent years in the standard of training and in the equipment of units.It is believed that the Red Air Force is given priority in the provision of funds, and it is certain that there is a strong propaganda in favour of a large-increase, both in numbers and in the industrial resources necessary to maintain and equip them.The force is at present regarded strictly as an adjunct to the Army, but its equipment includes a high proportion of long-range bombers, and there is no doubt that it could, and would, be used for direct attack on an enemy nation if opportunity offered.   Chemical warfare is intensively studied.The present strength is estimated at 1,040 aircraft in the first line, including 900 land planes and 140 seaplanes. It is believed that reserves amount to about 60 per cent, of first line strength, and that half these reserves are ready for use.The design and performance of Russian aircraft is fairly good, but not up to the standard of contemporary British products.Flying efficiency is believed to be good.Most landplane units and all seaplane units are located in the west, only weak air forces being stationed in Turkestan and Siberia. The areas of greatest concentration of landplane units are those opposite the frontiers of Poland and Roumania. The majority of seaplane units are located in the Black Sea. The development of air routes, together with existing railways to Turkestan and Siberia, will render air forces mobile and make possible the speedy reinforcement of those areas by units from&apos;Western Russia.Beyond the fact that the efficiency of the aircraft industry is improving, partly as a result of the Five-Year Plan, and that a good deal of attention is paid to research, there is no reliable information as to the productive capacity of Russia in air material.On completion of the 5-year development plan for civil aviation, Russia will possess a vast network composed of trunk lines and feeder lines. It is officially stated that 15,000 people are to be trained this year for work in civil aviation. It is certain that the potential military value of civil aviation plays a large part in this development plan.On the whole it appears that the general efficiency of the Soviet air force has not yet reached the standard obtaining in Great Britain, France, Italy, and the USA., but that further expansion and improvement must be expected.(e) United States.The scale of expenditure on technical equipment is high in the United States. In certain directions, notably the development of aircraft for launching from catapults, the air services of the United States are further advanced than those of any other country.  Many of the pilots also reach a high standard.  As a whole
both naval and military air services probably lack the discipline and cohesion which are attained by the R.A.F.The development of civil aviation and the aircraft industry is such that the U.S.A. must be regarded as extremely well placed so far as potential reserves ofThe importance of the Japanese air force is limited to the area within air range of Japanese territory. Its present technical efficiency does not compare favourably with that of the air services of the United States or of Great Britain. Until Japan is in a position to produce her own aircraft and maintain her air services on a higher level of efficiency she can only be considered as a second class Air Power. The average Japanese pilot has a high standard of personal courage and obedience to orders, but is lacking in initiative and mechanical sense. This difficulty also applies to the enlisted personnel who are obtained by conscription. (Military Air Service 2 years, Naval Air Service 4 years.)(f) Japan.[5355Jd

The sum taken in Army Estimates for 1914-15 was  1,000,000 for the Royal Flying Corps (personnel and equipment); and in Navy Estimates,  375,000 for aircraft equipment. The personnel figures of expenditure for the Royal Naval Air Service were not separately shown in Navy &quot;Votes.For foreign air services no reliable pre-war figures of expenditure are available.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).In order to maintain squadrons up to their establishment of aircraft (usually 12 per squadron), reserve stocks are necessary in addition to the immediate reserve held in units. These stocks are, in particular, necessary to squadrons overseas, on account of la) Their distance from sources of production and of major repair; and (&amp;) The greater immediacy of operational requirements.No steps have been taken to provide any reserves against the contingency of a major war.5. Productive Capacity of British Aircraft Industry.(i) The present annual production of the aircraft industry in types of air-craft of use for operational or military training purposes is about 1,000 aircraft. In addition, this industry has developed a considerable internal and export trade in light aeroplanes, but the manufacturing resources engaged in light aeroplane production could not be diverted to production of service aircraft without considerable delay and break in output.[5355] d 2
It is estimated that, under war conditions, the production of aircraft in the first six months of war might amount to 1,200 aircraft, taking as a basis the aircraft industry as at present constituted. A considerable production of light aeroplanes (probably as many as 30 a week) could also be achieved.(ii) After the first six months the output would rise sharply, and the rate would depend on the extent to which aircraft production can be given priority above other forms of war material.(iii) The output, even in the first six months of war, could be substantially increased if measures were taken in peace to provide stocks of jigs, gauges, master tracings and working drawings^ to enable a large amount of sub-contracting to be instituted immediately on the outbreak of war.2.

The above figures include throughout State expenditure on civil aviation (estimated at 215,034,000 francs for 1931-32).3. The figures for the years preceding 1929-30, when a unified Air Budget was first presented, contain an allowance, as estimated by the British Air Ministry, for cost of ancillary services which were not then segregable in detail from the Military and Naval Budgets.4. Some non-effective expenditure not included above is borne by Ministry of Pensions&apos; Budget.(by Pre-War.   Information not available.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).In addition to reserves of aircraft held Avith units amounting to 337 (see 1 (b) above), the French air service is estimated to possess a stored reserve of about 650 aircraft, of military types, but information on this point is kept secret. It is, however, certain that most of these are of obsolete types, and the French air service is undoubtedly at present weak both in quality and quantity of reserves of equipment. The extra budgetary provision (325,000,000 francs for 1931-32) will be largely applied to mitigating these defects.5. Productive Capacity of French Aircraft Industry.The present output is estimated at about 140 aircraft a month, or about 600 aircraft in the first three montlhs of war. If the projected &quot; law for the organisa-tion of the nation in time of war,&quot; drawn up in 1928, but not yefenacted, was put into effect, a considerable increase in this output would be secured, but not for about 3 months after the outbreak of war.The rate of subsequent output cannot be estimated with any accuracy it would depend upon the intensiveness of the national effort and in the extent to which aircraft and aero engines were given priority in labour and supplies as compared with other forms of armament.* Does not include supplementary credits.   Information not yet available.
6. Registered Civil Aircraft..The present number is about 1,100, and the aggregate horse-power of 460:-aircraft employed by air transport companies amounts to 166,000 horse-power.7. General Remarks on French Air Force.The French air service must definitely be accounted the most formidable organisation of air power possessed by any country in the world. The scale of equipment is at present inadequate in relation to its cadres. Increased budgetary allotments are now being provided towards making good that defect. There are good reserves of trained personnel to meet wastage. As regards peace time effectives, the personnel are efficient within the limits imposed by the one year conscription law. The long service voluntary personnel (who correspond more to our own personnel) are, of course, more efficient, but their numbers are inadequate in themselves to secure a high standard of maintenance throughout the service.The air strength overseas (300 aircraft) is about the same as that of the Royal Air Force overseas (320, including Fleet Air Arm on foreign stations), but the French air service has not so far undertaken responsibilities as a primary arm corresponding to those of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East.3.

No figures available.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).5. Productive Capacity of Aircraft Industry.No reserves of aircraft are at present maintained and wastage is made good by direct requisition from factories. The effective combatant strength of the Regia Aeronautica is, therefore, at present below what its nominal first line strength would suggest.The aircraft industry is, however, efficient and well-organised and its products compare favourably with those of any other continental power. The present production is estimated at about 500 aircraft yearly. It is difficult to estimate how quickly this rate could be increased in time of war or emergency, but one of her difficulties would be dependence upon external resources for some essential raw materials.General Observation.The present policy of the Italian Government in air matters is to combine outward show with inward parsimony. The strength of the Regia Aeronautica has been considerably increased in recent years and the Governments proclaimed policy is one of still further development. Budgetary provision has, however, been inadequate to provide an adequate backing in reserves of aircraft and other essential materials. Reserves of aircraft in units are practically non-existent and wastage is made good by direct supplies from factories.This policy also unfavourably affects the flying training and efficiency of the service as a whole.On the other hand there is no doubt that the potentialities of air power are highly regarded by Italy, and it is probable that the present deficiencies in organisation will be gradually reduced.6. Registered Civil Aircraft. 600 (estimated).* The years 1925 onwards include colonial air expenditure averaging about 25,000,000 lire annually: also State expenditure on civil aviation (at present about 76,500.000 lire).

No separate air expenditure figures are, however, quoted in the Naval and Military Budgets, from which the above figures have been extracted. They should be received with reserve and as not showing the true cost of the military and naval air services.No information available as to pre-war air expenditure.
4. Reserve of War Material (Air).Apart from the immediate reserve held with units (see under 1 (a) above), it is not thought that any considerable stored reserves of aircraft material exists, though about 60 aircraft are believed to be held for Fleet Air Arm expansion. Information is difficult to come by, as the Japanese are secretive in these matters, but the equipment of the Japanese air forces is probably distinctly inferior in scale and quality to that of the Chief European Powers.5. Productive Capacity of Japanese Aircraft Industry.This cannot be accurately assessed. The industry suffers from lack of indigenous designing capacity and from an indecisive policy as regards purchase of foreign aircraft. This has resulted in purchases of too many types in small numbers from different countries. These are built under licence in Japanese factories, but the information available suggests that the difficulties in increasing production on any outbreak of war would be considerable.6.

(6) Pre-War.No information available.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).Information as to stored reserves of aircraft and other air material is lacking, but it is not believed that the U.S.A. authorities have given much attention up to the present to forming stored reserves. There are estimated to be not less than 250 civil aircraft suitable for conversion to war use.5. Productive Capacity of U.S.A. Aircraft Industry.The present monthly output of aircraft is on the basis of actual production (2,684 aircraft) in 1929, 220 aircraft. The actual production in 1929 was much higher 6,034 aircraft in all these figures being derived from the annual Reports of the United States Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce. Plans are known to exist for increasing output on any outbreak of war, and there is no doubt that the productive resources of the United States of America for war (air) material substantially exceed those of any other Power. There are at present no fewer than 9,885 registered civil aircraft; this number probably contains many &quot; dead &quot; and obsolete machines, but when all allowances are made greatly exceeds the number of civil aircraft possessed by any other countiy.
6. Germany.1. Article 198 of the Treaty of Versailles prohibits Germany from main-taining any military or naval air forces. Up to the present this prohibition has been observed to the extent that Germany does not possess any striking air force nor could she successfully defend herself against air attack from the French side.2. German civil aviation is carried on under certain restrictions which were voluntarily accepted by Germany in 1926 (the Paris Air Agreement), the object of which is to control by numbers the training of military or naval personnel as air pilots and to prevent military aircraft being developed under the guise of civil aviation. .3. It could hardly be expected that Germany should yield any greater degree of assent to the provisions of Article 198 than she thinks either to be for the time being unavoidable or politically expedient; and in some directions civil aviation is being developed on lines clearly intended to provide a nucleus for a military air force. For example, it is believed that the restrictions imposed by the Paris Air Agreement on the number of members of the Army, Navy and Police services who may be allowed to fly as amateur pilots have been evaded both as to numbers and as to kind of flying practised by them. There is evidence-which goes to indicate that a number of officers of the German Army and Navy above the quota allowed have been illegally trained as pilots and some of them have been given definite military flying training at a school in Russia.. 4. On the material side, the prohibitions of the manufacture of military aircraft have not prevented manufacturers from studying military design nor from manufacturing military types. Three of the principal firms have for some years past maintained branch establishments in foreign countries where orders for military aircraft for other Powers have been carried out. A feature of this development has been the number of types capable of use for either civil or military purposes, the transformation from one to the other being but an inter-change of standardised parts requiring in some cases but a few hours&apos; work. This standardisation of parts common to both types enables their manufacture to proceed in parent factories in Germany without any formal violation of the restrictions placed on the manufacture within Germany of military aircraft. In this way military types can be constructed almost to completion within Germany and then sent abroad to branch factories for completion.5. Apart from the above features, it is inevitable that any form of civil aviation development particularly in a country of industrial aptitude and determination constitutes a nucleus round which a military and naval air force could be developed in a fairly short time.(a) The present number of amateur pilots is about 1,850, of whom 50 percent, are at present in flying practice; in addition, there are 550 pro-fessional pilots, the bulk-of whom are experienced and active men. The average net annual increase of new pilots is about 350.(b) Great interest is taken in &quot;gliding&quot; and there are estimated to be as many as 7,000 glider pilots many of whom would be excellent material for training as aeroplane pilots.(c) The number of civil aircraft registered in Germany at the end of 1929was 906, of which about 400 were commercial aircraft of this latter number about three-quarters might be fitted for military use though they would be definitely inferior in performance to military types in an up-to-date air service.(d) The German aircraft industry though small is enterprising and efficient.Its present output is 20-25 aircraft per month; under forced con-editions existing resources could probably produce, if necessary, not less than 100 aircraft per month.6. The naval and military staffs are known to be in frequent communica-tion with the Air Department of the Ministry of Communications and there is evidence that plans are matured for the establishment at some future date of small naval and military air services.[5355] f
1,030 515,00010 5,0007. Conclusion. It remains the fact that if a European war broke out Germany would at the outset be very weak in the air as compared with any probable enemies. She would require a breathing space of not less than a month to convert even her existing resources into a military air force; The enormous disparity in terms of military air power between Germany of to-day and France of to-day seems likely to be one of the most difficult of the questions which will confront the Disarmament Conference.7.

Czechoslovakia. 1. (a) Peace Strength, Regular Air Forces.
receives  1,985,000 per annum for 10 years over and above the annual budget. This credit is not liable to any official control, and no accounts are published. It is impossible, therefore, to ascertain how much of the Credit Fund is expended on air force, but it is probably sufficient to bring the total annual air expenditure up to about  1,000,000. &apos;Fveri this figure, however, does not include pay of personnel and various other expenses, which are included in the Army Vote and from which it is impossible to extract the amount allotted to the air force.4-  Reserves of War Material (Air).A stored reserve of 300 aircraft is maintained; in addition, there are some civil aircraft (estimated at 30) suitable for conversion to war use.5. Productive Capacity of Aircraft Industry.The industry is small but well organised, with a present productive capacity of about 30 aircraft a month.6. Registered Civil Aircraft. 100-200.7. General.The Air Service of Czecho-Slovakia, which is in its entirety a part of the Army, is an efficient force, and although comparatively small, is expanding on sound lines. It is supported by a well-organised aircraft industry which supplies all the needs of the country in aircraft, all of which are of Czecho-Slovakian design.   The industry is capable of considerable expansion in war.Conscription is in force, in the country, and while adequate reserves of semi and unskilled personnel exist, only a small number of pilots and skilled mechanics are available.Every effort is being made to improve the efficiency of the Air Service, and it should be capable of giving effective support to the Army in any war in which the country is likely to be engaged.There is no Naval Air Service.9.

The ascertainable air expenditure for 1929-30 appears to have been about  537,000, but, as indicated, this takes no account of many items.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).No stored reserves are at present provided and the scale of provision of equipment is quite inadequate to maintain the nominal first-line strength in the field for even a short time.5. Productive Capacity of Aircraft Industry.This is believed to be about 15 aircraft a month.6. Registered Civil Aircraft.Exact number unknown, does not exceed 25.7. General.Yugo-Slavia&apos;s air service may be regarded as being as efficient as any in the Balkans and expansion is slow but steady. She suffers, however, from lack of sufficient repair and maintenance facilities and from her dependence upon imported air material.Conscript service provides an adequate non-skilled reserve, but her skilled reserve is small.Considerable attention is now being given to the development of the Naval Air Service.10.

(The &quot; Supply Reserve &quot; vote is at present 13 per cent, of the total military budget.)Much is also paid for under supplementary estimates, in which Military Attach^, Warsaw, has been unable to trace detailed expenditure. - Local government bodies contribute unknown, sums towards air defence.Civil aviation expenditure not included in above figures amounted to  286,000 in 1929-30 and to  300,000 in 1930-31.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).Stored reserves amount possibly to 350 aircraft, but information on this, subject is scanty.5. Productive Capacity of Aircraft Industry.This amounts at present to, perhaps, 35 aircraft a month, but here, again,, information as to present or potential output is incomplete.
6. Registered Civil Aircraft. About 100.7. General.Polish air forces are thought to be well organised and moderately efficient. Considerable attention is being given to air matters and, in particular, to training facilities. Considerable progress has been made by the aircraft industry, and, for aircraft, Poland is in a fair way to becoming independent of foreign supply.11. Rotimania.1.

Expenditure.No means exist for separating air expenditure from the military budget of which it forms part and which amounted to  11,120,000 in 1931. Out of this sum  500,000 was allotted for purchase of air material.4. Reserves of War Material (Air).5. Productive Capacity of Aircraft Industry.Information is scanty, but it can be safely assumed that reserves of aircraft are small, and that the aircraft industry is small and at present not well organised.
6. Registered Civil Aircraft.No recent information, but number is inconsiderable.7. General.The Roumanian Military Air Service, as it at present exists, would be of little value in the event of war. It is equipped with obsolescent aircraft, many of which are unserviceable, very little flying is done and the standard of training, both of pilots and mechanics, is low.The aircraft industry is almost non-existent. One factory exists, which is practically controlled by French interests, but the output is very small.The main reasons for the lack of progress and development, both in the Air Service and the aircraft industry, are the shortage of funds and the fact that Roumania as a nation shows little enthusiasm in Air matters.Conscription is in force in Roumania, and her position as regards reserves is much the same as in the other small Central European Powers.o
