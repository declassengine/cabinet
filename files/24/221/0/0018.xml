DPJKTX. OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S, GOVERNMENT )CP. 118 .(51j,copy ITOcC A B I NET.FUTURE AIRSHIP POLICY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering Letter from the Chairman, of the Committee on National Expenditure.I circulate for the information of the cabinet copy of a letter which I have received from the Chairman of the Committee on National Expenditure.     It will he seen that the Committee recommend that the proposal of the Air Ministry for the expenditure of  120,000 rising to  140,000 a year on the policy of the &quot;watching &quot;brief&quot; should be rejected;    that expenditure in the current year should be restricted to the amount provided In Air Estimates, 1931  ( 50,000);    and that expenditure in future years should be kept at least within the limit of  20,000 a year mentioned in paragraph 12 (b)  (ii) of the Air Ministry paper (CP. 94  (31)), subject to examination of the details by the Treasury.      They think however that Cardington should be retained for the present, the question of disposal being reviewed/ed after say 3 years. AyI concur in these proposals, and ask my colleagues to adopt them as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government,,P.S.Treasury,  S.V/.May 8th, 1931.
8 th Mty , 1931.Dear Cliancellor of the .Sxehecuev,In our examination of Air Sstinates we have noted that provision has &quot;been made in Vote 3 in respect of Airships of  GOs000 &quot;on account&quot;, pending a decision of Ho He Government as to  their future policy,,      v.*e understand that &quot;before talcing that decision H.M. Government would &quot;be glad to have &quot;before them our views on the Question of the desirability of incurring further expenditure on this account,,     We have accordingly obtained from the Air Ministry a statement of the proposals which they intend to lay before the Cabinet, and have taken oral evidence thereon from the Secretary of the Ministry5 Mr, Bullock.The Air Ministry propose to  adopt the policy of a &quot;watching brief&quot;, including the refitting and recommissioning of R 100 and its use for short experimental flights? at a total estimated cost of  120,000, rising to  140,000 a year,      This would involve a Supplementary Estimate of  70,000 this year, and a corresponding increase of expenditure in future years, against which the Air Ministry are unable to suggest any economies under other heads.      This liability would, continue until the experiments now being made in Germany and Hie U.S.A. have readied a point when it can be definitely stated either that there is no commercial future for the airship, or that it is worth while for H.H. Government to negotiate with outside interests for the construction and operation of airships on a commercial basis, presumably with the aid of a Government subsidy0     Me understand that the present Air Council do not contemplate in any circumstances a further programme of construction by the State itself.
After due consideration, we think that this proposal should he rejected, for the following reasons -(l)      In the first place3 we consider that in the present financial stringency an exceedingly strong case would have to he made out before any new service of this magnitude could be sanctioned.      In our opinion no such case has been made out in favour of the present proposal,,(2)      On the contraryj even if the financial situation were less unfavourable, we should regard further expenditure by the State on Airship development as extremely speculative:(a) It has always been open to grave doubt whether Airships can ever be flown under the conditions of safety and regularity which are essential to a commercial service;    and this doubt has obviously been Increased - to put it no higher - by the R 101 disaster.(b) There appear to be no means of estimating the cost of operating such a service, including depreciation, or the probable receipts.,     Viewed as a business proposition;, the scheme is a pure gamble: . and while It can safely be assumed that a State subsidy would be needed for very many years to come, the amount required is quite uncertain,,(c) HUM. Government already spend  350,000 a year on subsidies to heavier-than-aircraft services, and we understand that plans for additional services are under consideration^     At the same time new fast steamship services are being promoted by several companies;    while the possibilities of new developments by wireless telegraphy and telephony are almost unlimited,.      It is at least doubtful whether the amount of fast traffic, both mail and passenger, will be great enough to support the competition of airships, which are unlikely to afford
more than a compromise &quot;between the rival, claims of speed, comfort, regularity and security, with these:, other forms of service.(3)    The Air Ministry contend that it is worth while to continue to operate the R 100 because it is only by this means that a trained crew can be retained in being and the highly skilled art of airship navigation kept alive in this country.    We do not overlook this argument, but we would observe that on the Air Ministry&apos;s own showing the importance of this object is relative not absolute;    they are prepared to spend  140,000 a year to secure it, but not  240,000  (if helium has to be provided)-     If airship development is ever revived in this country as a result of successful experiments abroad, in our opinion it is reasonable to expect that we shall be able to make a friendly&quot; arrangement with other Governments for British crews to be given the necessary training on foreign airships.-     Facilities for training in the R.I\T. and R.A.F.- are commonly provided by H.M* Government for the personnel of other countries and we do not think it necessary fo pay  120,000 a year to insure against the risk that such facilities will be denied to us, provided that we are willing to pay a reasonable price for the privilege.(4) Although the Air Ministry inform us that they are determined at all costs to restrict expenditure during the next few years to a maximum of  140,000 a year, we think that it may prove very difficult to adhere to this resolution, especially if, as seems highly probable, public opinion should insist on the substitution   of helium for hydrogen in the R 100 as a necessary measure of safety.    The present Council cannot of course bind its successors.      Generally.,
speaking, we think that the existence oi a nucleus organisation is a standing temptation to expenditure on further developments; which the State is unlikely to be able to afford.Even under favourable economic conditions, we think that the above considerations are such as would render very great caution necessary before further indefinite commitments were entered into by the State. Under existing financial conditions we regard&apos; them as conclusive against the Air Ministry proposal.We therefore recommend that R 100 should forthwith be sold or dismantled, that expenditure in 1931 be restricted    to the  50,000 provided In the Estimates,  and that expenditure In future years be kept at least within the limit of  20,000 per annum mentioned by the Air Ministry.      Whether it is really necessary to spend up to that limit we have not had time to satisfy ourselves:    the details would no doubt be carefully scrutinised by the Treasury.We think that there may be a good case for -retaining Cardington,  at any rate until a favourable opportunity occurs for disposal of the property;  the question should be brought up for review after say 3 years.Yours faithfully, (Sgd)        G - E.- MAY.The Rt0 Hon. Philip Snowden. Mcp0
