(THIS iJOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO VERNMENT)REGRET  . CP.   126  (51).COPY NO,6CABINETTICS LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL.Memorandum, by the Minister of Transport.I submit a short report on the progress of this Bill and points arising out of it.1.    The settlement with the Underground Companies is before the Committee;    certain outstanding questions remain (mainly in connection with winding up the holding companies) but will,  I hope, present no serious difficulty. 2.    Main Lines.      I have already reported orally that I have reached an agreement with the Main Lines to which the Underground Group is a consenting party.        It provides definitely for a pooling of the passenger receipts of the Board and the passenger receipts arising from the suburban traffic of the Main Lines in&apos; tho area, which under the Bill was left to be a matter of subsequent decision by the Minister of Transport in default of agreement between the Board and the Main Lines.      The pool will extend to all . passenger traffic whereas the Bill as introduced con-templated a pool of competitive traffic only.      The Main Lines will come under the same arrangements as the Board in respect of review of the facilities and develop-ments which they provide or should provide.      Amendments
to Clause 22 and also to Clauses 20 and 21 will be submitted to give effect to these arrangements. The Ivlain Linos&apos; have withdrawn their    opposition to the Bill on preamble.      Various points remain to be dealt with on clauses,- but their adjustment should cause no special difficulty.    I regard this settle-men t as an important factor in the development of London Transport, including the prospects of suburban electrificaticn ,3.      Metropolitan Railway.    I can report no definite progress in negotiation.      The Company has stated that it is an opponent of the Bill.4.   * Lond on C oun ty Co un oil.      The arguments for the basis of taking over the local Authority trams (under which the Board will pay to  the Local Authorities the amounts required to meet the charges on their outstanding debt)  have been put to the Committee and the L.G.C.  und some other authorities, have stated their objections to it.5,      Staff petitions -      (Terms of transfer, superannuation, etc.)    The Ministry is in touch with the organisations concerned and is prepared to discuss the points raised in the petitions before the clauses are reached.On the. important question  (raised by the Railway Unions) of instituting machinery for facilitating agreements as to terms and conditions of&apos; employment, my Counsel has intimated to the Committee the possibility of devising a machinery which will meet the point of the petitions by the Railway Unions and I propose to introduce clauses into the Bill,
The Transport Workers1 Union has strongly urged definite provision being made for the repros representation  of labour in the industry cn the Board, but I propose to resist the proposal;    I have the concurrence of the Railway Unions. 6.      ^fter consulting the Solicitor General,  I am proposing certain alterations in the rules for determining compensation to meet what appear to bc reasonable objections to the clauses as drafted. In particular it is proposed to recognise expressly that some allowance should be made in respect of capital which has not had time to fructify and also to recognise loss due to severance where part only of an undertaking is taken over.7.      lower of Board to manufacture.    No negotiations have been opened and I am claiming full powers.    Opposition is being manifested by the Society of Motor Manufacturers, the Railway Carriage and Wagon Builders&apos; Association and certain other bedies which have petitioned against the Board having the power to manufacture its cwn roiling stock (railway carriages,  etc., tramcars and motor vehicles).        Statutory railway companies exorcise this power as being incidental to their business and non-statutory tramway and omnibus companies possess it under their articles of association.      Arguments in favour cf the power may be based on convenience, efficiency and economy.        Important also is the need for the Board having some protection against a ring. But,   ;m the other side, we are&apos; faced with the contention that our manufacturing firms can only meet foreign competition if they have /
tire &quot;benefit of large scale production end that manufacture by the Board for its own purposes must9 if resorted to s weaken their position.      In other words 9 it will be said that we run the risk of &quot;irrationalisation&quot; end our witnesses may be asked what is the Government policy in this matter.      we cans of courses make in reply the points already indicated and point out that ninety per cent of the existing requirements of the London General Omnibus Company and its subsidiaries will be placed with one outside firm for a period of ten years under the arrangement we have made.      Y/e must not leave out of account the tactical position in regard to carrying tho Bill successfully tiirouah committee but the question involves principles of industrial policy^ At first si,..ht power to manufacture looks like clear Socialist policys but we must also ask ourselves whether it is sound industrial economics for s if not 5 it is unlikely to be sound Socialism.      The Government has   -urged the manufacturers cf private cars to get together and. consolidate the export trade and the needless lack of standardisation in the industry is one of its weak pointSo      To consolidate and nationalise commercial vehicle manufacture is one thing;    to develop    a policy of transport operators each making their own is anothers just as it would be a doubtful policy for a number of local authorities each to own its own coalmine as against the national consolidation of the whole mining industry. Nevertheless I desire protection against rings$ and I should welcome an opportunity of some further discussion with my colleagues.
80 The alteration in the character of the &quot;C&quot; stock of the Board (which will now he dependent on earnings of the year, subject to cert:..in conditions and a strictupward limit)  has raised the question whether the Board will an?-any longer &quot;be a &quot;public authority&quot; within the meaning ofvarious Acts.      It is essential that the Board should bea public authority for  the purposes of the London traffic act, 1924,  and the Bead Traffic Act,  1950, and someamendment to the Bill will be necessary.      I think theBoard should be  a Public Authority also for tho purposes ofthe Public Authorities Protection Act (under whichproceedings against any person for  .nything done in execution of any Act or of any public duty or authority donot lie unless commenced within 6 months).There remains for consideration the position Under the Trades Disputes Act,  1927,  on which I am consulting the Minister of Health.(Intld.)
