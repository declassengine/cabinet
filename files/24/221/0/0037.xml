June 1st s 1931o
On May 19th, 1931,  the Prime Minister received in his room at the house of Commons a deputation from the Joint Committee of the three Railway Trade Unions on the co-ordination and public ownership of transport.      The Prime Minister was accompanied by the Minister of Labour,.the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Trans-port.In introducing the deputation, Mr. A.G. Walkden, M.P.,General Secretary of the Railway Clerks Association, referred tothe recent decisions of the Railway National Wages Board and sub-mitted the Addendum to Findings No.119 (5th March, 1931) relatingto Claims for modifications of Rates of Pay and Conditions ofService, referred to the Board in January, 1931.&quot;Whilst concurring in the Findings which provide a measure of assistance for the purpose of enabling the companies to encounter the immediate difficulties, we desire at the same time to state that in our opinion this enquiry has clearly revealed the necessity for other action,  in order that the industry may be in a position to provide the transport facilities, desired by industry, commerce and the travelling public.&quot;In our view the continuation of four separate Groups of Railways is unsatisfactory.      Modern require-ments make further co-ordination imperative, and the present enquiry has reinforced our opinion that only along the lines of comprehensive national organisation-of all forms of transport under public ownership and control can the problems of the transport industry be overcome. &quot;(Signed) W.P. Allen.&quot; C.T.  Cramp.&quot; W.  Lobbie.&quot; S, Garrison.&quot; Thos.  H.  Gill.&quot; Geo.  Lathan.&quot; Henry J. Lay.&quot; Arthur Pugh.Mr. Walkden said that the reduction of wages was an exceedingly serious matter for the railway workers, and although certainly the case for public ownership must be decided upon the basis of national interests and national-1-
policy,  it was legitimate for the workpeople to advocate 1a method of reorganisation calculated to increase their economic security.      He pointed out that the present was a favourable time to consider nationalisation, as railway stock of a nominal value of approximately  1,100,000,000 now had a market value of round about  700,000,000, and the State should be able to acquire the railways at a reasonable figurec      Grouping under the Railways Act of 1921 had not met the problem and circuitous routing and other unsound competitive practices were still obtaining. In the view of the Unions it would be most unwise to nationalise railways alone for it wan vital that transport should be looked at as a whole if the road versus railway war, of which the workpoeple were so largely the victims, was to be stopped. The Unions therefore urged that both road and railway transport should be brought under public ownership, and that even air transport and coastwise shipping should be pojasidered.      He referred sympathetically to the method adopted in the london passenger Transport Bill,.      The problem was not without s^me significance to the mining industry,, f.?r tho practice which obtained in a limited area of the railways merchanting coal between the    colliery owners and the retailers should be extended and great economies in the handling of coal between the purchaser and the consumer effected.      The Unions did not expect the Prime Minister to he in a position to give an immediate decision? but the matter was one of urgency in view of the fact that the present wages agreement only lasted for a year,      They hoped that steps might be taken at once to appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee for the purpose of preparing a plan,Mr.  C.T.   Cramp, General Secretary of the National
n o n383Union of Railwaymen,  emphasised the seriousness of the recent wages decision and still more stressed the great danger in the further settlement which would have to  be made in March, 19 32, when the present agreement expired. Ii destructive competition within arid between the various forms of transport was to continue they would be faced with even greater difficulties next year than they were this, and there was a really grave danger of a big strike taking place which should certainly he avoided if at all possible in the interests of the country. He referred to theproceedings before the Royal Commission on Transport, particularly to the evidence  of Sir M. Hicks, who,  although not of our school of thought, nevertheless seemed to conclude that nationalisation was inevitable.        The Minority Report of the Royal Commission was an important contribution to the problem. Mr.  Cramp said that road transportcompetition was a serious matter for the railways and the railway workers, particularly as road transport labour con-ditions were below those of the railwaymen*At this point the Prime Minister had to leave for another engagement and,  expressing his regret for so doing, said that the deputation were,   of course,  talking to the converted on this subject. He would like a further opportunity to meet them for the purpose of talking over the important details    involved.      The Government found itself faced with a number of difficult industrial problems,  including mining and transport.       There was no question as to the purpose and object of the Government in these matters, but they were always faced with the problem of method, and it was to  examine this that he would like further discussions to take place.After the Prime Minister had left, the Minister of
Transport took the Chair at the prime Minister&apos;s request, and Mr, Cram;,,  continuing, reminded the Ministers of the declaration in &quot;Labour and the Nation&quot; on the subject with which they were dealing, and the popularity of the issue at the General Election.        He,desired to emphasise the point that they did not raise their representations on the wages issue alone,  but they believed that the public ownership of transport would be a sound business proposition from the point of view of the community.Mr.  John Bromley, M.P.,  General Secretary of the Associated. Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, supported what had been said,      lie referred to the needlessly heavy original cost of railway construction, to the bad management of the undertakings and lack of standardisation; yet there had been an average profit of  44,000,000 during the last three years.        He had not the least desire to make any threats for the purpose of urging a policy on the Government but they had great difficulty in holding their people in connection    with the recent reductions ana it would be quite impossible to hold them next time unless., at any rate, re-organisation of the transport system was definitely on the way.Mr. Walkden referred to the Weir Report on Railway Electrification.        He thought it would be found that the Companies had been reluctant and slow in the matter of electrification, which was shown by the Heir Report to be worth while financially. In any case, the companies were not in aposition to raise the capital and he doubted whether they had the ability effectively to see such a policy through.      In these circumstances the Railway Unions were definitely averse to any State guarantee or contribution to general railway

It was a question of how and when.      He shared entirely the feeling of the railwaymen that it vras unfair to them that their wages conditions should be imperilled as a result of the disordered organisation of transport as a whole,  for frhich they, as such, were not responsible, but he was glad they realised that there must be a national business case for the public ownership of any industry.      He entirely agreed that the transport problem must be looked at as a whole and that the success of publicly owned railways alone might be risky.      It was of great, importance that they should have regard to the transport problem generally.      They would be unwise, however, not to realise that there were some snags;    for example, the greater part of road commercial transport was not functioning as a common carrier but was transport in the separate ownership of the manufacturing and distributing firms employing transport for their own purposes;  and then there was the question of the place of the docks in a national transport system.

slovenly way if success was to be achieved.      It really was the case that achieving socialisation in practical form, was a longer and more difficult job than many had thoughts That, however, must not cause them to funk the issue.      As they had anticipated,  the Prime Minister could not commit the Government at this stage;    but he had noted with interest the important views of the Railway Unions,  and the Ministers present would report fully to the Prime Minister upon the matter.After some further discussion in which the Minister cf Labour and the Lord Privy Seal took part,  the deputation cordially thanKed the Ministers for the time they had given to the discussion and it was decided that a short agreed statement should be issued to the Press,-6-
