jflfs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. secret. ,M        i&quot; -COPY NOIC.P. 104(31).CABINET. RURAL HOUSING.Memorandum by one Minister of Health.Some members of the Literal Party have proposed that the Government should, as an emergency measure for the relief of unemployment, undertake the &quot;building of 100,000 houses for agricultural workers in rural areas and &apos;che Government have promised that a scheme which has been prepared bySir Tudor Walters, M.P., far the purpose shall be fully considered,The scheme proposes that the number of houses to be built in each parish and &quot;che sr&amp;es on which the houses are to be built shall be determined by the Ministry of Agriculture in consultation with che County Councils, that the land required shall be purchased on behalf of the Government by the Valuation Department and that the houses shall be built by the Office of works.     It is proposed that the cost of the houses shall in the first instance be met out of capital moneys te be borrowed by the Government, and that when built the houses shall be transferred to the district councils on such terms as will enable the councils to let them at 2s.6d. or 3s. a week without charge to the ratepayers.Sir Tudor Walters suggests that the houses can be-  .built at a cost of  300 inclusive of land and services. It is clear, however, that at present prices this figure is too low and that the cost might be nearer  400 than  300.     If the
cost were puc at  350,   the capital moneys required to be raised on loan would be  35,000,000-     Out of a rent of 3s. a week, at least ls.6d. a week would be   required for repairs fund and management, leaving a net rent available for interest and repayment of Is.6d. a week, equivalent to a present capital sum cf about  75 a bouse, or  7,500,000 for 100,000 bouses. The &quot;cotal loss on the scheme on the basis of these estimates would be  27,500,000.Sir Tudor Walters proposes, however, that the Councils to whom the houses are transferred should receive the ordinary annual housing subsidy from the Ministry, so that the less, to the extent of the capital value of the Exchequer subsidies payable under existing Housing Acts, would be spread over 40 years.     The annual Exchequer subsidy for houses in agricultural parishes is  11 por annum for 40 years and for houses in nen-agricultural parishes is  7.10.0 for 40 years.      If it is assumed that three-fourths of the houses would be provided in agricultural parishes, the present capital value of the cotal subsidies payable would be approximately  17,000,000-     The total loss therefore of  27,500,000 would require to be met by an immediate Exchequer charge of  10,500,000 and an annual Exchequer charge of housing subsidies ever 40 years equivalent to  17,000,000.The Government policy for dealing with rural housing was set out in certain clauses of che Housing Act of 1930 and was approved by Parliament as recently as last August.      The Act of 1930 aimed at ensuring a more active and comprehensive treatment of che rural housing problem -chan had been accorded to it in che past.     The Act sought to obtain -che advantages cf the direction and assistance of che larger local authority by putting a definite responsibility upon the County Councils for rural housing and by giving -chein entirely new powers and duties.
The County Councils are empowered to assist the rural district councils in all possible ways;    they may give help to the district councils by way of technical advice; they may undertake building work themselves on behalf of the district councils;    they may contribute to the expenses of the district council, and they are placed under a definite obligation to make a contribution of  1 a year for 40 years for every house provided for an agricultural worker..  This contribution is to be applied in aid of the rate charge which rural district councils would otherwise have to bear.    One main object of the financial provisions was to meet the case of the small and financially weak rural district council, especially one suffering from derating.It is also made the duty of the County Councils to keep themselves informed of housing conditions in the rural districts in their areas and to ascertain the extent of the needs and the adequacy of the steps taken to meet them.    Every rural district council was required to furnish to the County Council, before 31st December,  1930,   such information with regard to housing conditions in the rural district as the County Council required for purposes of their survey.    The County Councils are not required by the Act to submit the results of their survey to the Minister but they are being asked to furnish full particulars of the conclusions they have come to when they have had time to complete their enquiries.    After the rural district councils have made their reports to the County Council,   some time must be allowed for investigation by the Medical Officers of Health and consideration by the appropriate committee of the Council.    I am aware that the work is still incomplete and I understand that many County Councils
wish to convene meetings with the district councils before they reach final conclusions.    The General Inspectors of the Department are keeping in touch with the County Councils in the matter and they will,  if necessary,  attend the meetings called by the Councils,  render such assistance as they can and endeavour to secure a completion of the work by all Councils at as early a date as possible.    I am asking the County Councils to submit reports by 31st Fay.    When the results of the surveys required to be made under the Act of 1930 by County Councils are known,  there will be available for the first time in the history of housing an effective statement of the need as seen by the larger local authorities.    When the County reports have been received,  it will be necessary to consider whether what is proposed to be done by the district councils and the County Councils is or is not adequate.    If it is judged to be inadequate,  further steps must be considered for dealing with the situation, where it is clear that further action is necessitated by local inability and not by local unwillingness to shoulder the burden.    where neglect to meet the need is due to unwillingness on the part of the local authorities,,  I have ample powers in the Housing Acts to enforce compliance,  if necessary,   in the last resort, by building myself at the cost of the authorities.The question for the decision of the Cabinet is whether the arrangements embodied in the Act of 1930,   so far as the building of houses for agricultural labourers is concerned, shall be allowed to remain,  for the present, undisturbed,  or whether they shall be immediately recast and a scheme adopted for national building in rural areas at the entire expense of the Exchequer on the lines of that proposed by Sir Tudor Walters.The scheme is put forward by Sir Tudor Walters partly as a meau^re for the improvement of rural housing and partly as a means of relieving unemployment in the building trade.
It is stated, no doubt with  some truth,  that there are some Rural District Councils whose rate resources have been so restricted under the Local Government Act of 12 29 that they are unable to bear a further rate charge for housing.      It is also  said that the County Councils will be disinclined to exercise their powers under the Housing Act  of 1930 to give the necessary assistance to these financially weak Rural Districts and that, unless the Government are prepared to provide houses without charge to the ratepayers, no provision will be made.      In the main, however, the scheme is defended as an emergency measure and it is suggested that the provisions for the housing of rural workers in the Act of 1930 will remain as the permanent method of providing for rural housing, unaffected by such emergency action.This contention of course raises the  question whether there has or has not been any attempt to estimate the actual need for rural houses in taking a figure of 100,000 as the number in the scheme.      I am advised that no such estimate has been made by Sir Tudor Walters.      But it would be required as a preliminary to action on the scheme, and the extent of the final scheme and of the contribution to be made by the scheme to the relief of unemployment cannot be forecast till it  is forthcoming.but information as Is available to me does not in fact suggest that the need is anything lilco so high as it is put by Sir Tudor Walters.      If, how eve r,  In determining a need to be met at the cost of the Exchequer and not  of the rates, account Is to be taken of the views of local authorities,  it may be confidently anticipated that the need will be put high enough to obviate any necessity for
a considerable period of that action under the Housing Act of 1930 which Sir Tudor Walters views as the permanent policy unaffected by his emergency scheme.     The probable result will in fact be to maice rural housing exclusively a charge on the Exchequer.     Whether this does or does not prove to be the case, distressed urban areas, unable to take advantage of the facilities of the Acts of 1924 and 1930, will have an irresistible claim for terms as good as are given to rural areas.We shall then have to ado. to the heavy capital cost of the rural scheme a very material sum for similar building in distressed urban areas, and, before the amount of that sum can be ascertained, we shall have to decide what is to be the criterion of a distressed urban area and to negotiate on that point with the associations of local authorities,  and also as to what  is to be the total number of houses to be built under the emergency arrangements in those areas.     Hard hit districts in South Wales and Durham would in any case have to come in.     Many other districts all over the country which on any ground, might regard themselves  is necessitous would press for inclusion and,  except&apos;perhaps in some of the larger cities, work under the Housing Acts would tend to  come to a standstill. In fact the implication in such a scheme as Sir Tudor Walters proposes is to what extent the provision of houses for the working classes is to become a responsibility of the central Government.     The scheme cannot be properly considered in isolation on its own merits - it raises wide general questions of housing policy which will have to be weighed
anci decided at the outset by the  Government .In regard to the scheme itself,   I must,  I think, add that the practical difficulties of, and the time needed for, putting it into  effect arc very much underrated.      The legislation which would be required would in view   of the heavy financial commitments proposed and of the Local Government  interests involved,  necessarily be contentious and would take a considerable time.     Statutory provision would be required not only for building by the State and raising the necessary loans but also for the transfer of the houses, after they were built,  to  the local authorities.    The terms on which the houses are to be transferred to,  and vested in,  local authorities would require to be laid down in the Bill and the necessary negotiations with the authorities would have to be undertaken before the Bill was introduced.      Further, the control by a central Department of building houses  in twos and threes in thousands of widely scattered parishes all over the country,   if It  is to be effectively done, would be most cumbersome and costly.     There is also grave reason to fear that an attempt to build in the rural areas in the manner proposed would substantially increase the present cost of houses.For the above reasons I have felt the greatest difficulty in accepting the scheme.      It is, however, being strongly pressed, particularly by Ivir. Lloyd George, and I must put the issues to my colleagues.ggrd April,  1?31.( Intld .)    A.G.
