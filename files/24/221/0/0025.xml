An Aspect of International Relations in 1931.1.-INTRODUCTION.LAST year, in a paper bearing this title, I ventured, with the help of the competent Departments of the Foreign Office and our Ambassadors in Paris, Rome and Berlin, to draw attention to the period of dualism in which we are living. No events of a catastrophic nature occurred during last year to disturb or distort the tenour of Europe&apos;s political ways. This dualism, however, in international relations has become sufficiently marked to warrant a second bulletin (and this time a more thorough one), on the old Adam first identified in the memorandum of last May, for the purpose of studying the various manifestations of pre-war psychology that have lately occupied the Depart-ment and Europe. Only thus shall we be in a position to judge whether any progress has been made in curtailing the activities of this reprehensible character.In exorcising his spirit two essential points must be remembered beyond the preliminary remark that the views in this paper are only my own and those of my colleagues, notably Mr. Sargent, who have collaborated in its production. First, it is not enough to say &quot;no progress has been made, but, on the other hand, there has been no retrogression.&quot; If we are standing still, we are losing ground; it is the old story that he who is not with us is against us. Secondly, if it is now manifest that the old Adam has duration  the projection of the past into the present this is only one side of the picture; and we must be careful not to underestimate the forces arrayed against him, or the extent to which he has been blown upon in the last dozen years. But with this other and brighter side of the balance-sheet, the League and all it stands for, this paper does not profess to deal, although it includes a brief section on the subject. Its object is to chart the rocks and shoals, and it might take as its text some words spoken by the Secretary of State to the press on his return from Geneva in January. V The state of Europe is not what it might be. .... It is clear that the problems left by the war have not been so completely liquidated as some were inclined to think a year ago. I do not want to be considered an alarmist in saying this far from it.&quot; (The latter part of this statement had recently seemed likely to receive striking confirmation from an episode in which the Secretary of State himself figured largely. I refer, of course, to the Naval Agreement with France and Italy, mainly attributable to our diplomacy, an achievement which bade fair to mitigate one of the main causes of European unrest. Owing to the twelfth-hour difficulties raised by the French, this better augury for the solution of the problems now facing Europe has seemed likely to suffer a set-back. It is. still hoped that this may be avoided; but the hitch has already again tended to impair Franco-Italian relations, and should it prove intractable, those relations must inevitably drift again into their old bad habits.)In order that these problems may be thoroughly examined, it has seemed wise to study the situation from the three different angles of nationalism, economics and international co-operation. First, therefore, an endeavour will be made to give a brief picture of the Nationalist aspect of European politics; secondly, the connexion, nowadays so marked, between politics and economics will be similarly treated; and thirdly, the position as regards co-operation between the nations will be reviewed in the light of recent developments in the League of Nations.The conclusion reached in the last memorandum was that &apos;&apos; the conflict is still between the &apos; haves &apos; and the &apos; have-nots,&apos; between France and her entourage on the one hand, and on the other Germany and the ex-enemy States, with Italy tending to replace Germany as their leader. At this rate, in the future there may be three candidates for the hegemony of Europe : (1) France, who might be described as the holder of the cup; (2) Italy; and (3) G ermany, who will be strong runners-up so soon as they have trained into form at home. There will also be during this period continual play with the idea of combinations between two of[5185] &apos; -)    b 2
the three candidates, complicated by threats already uttered, and the possibility of bringing Russia in for a foursome.&quot; Thus the continent is still riddled with pre-war thought. Alongside the ideals of the League, the pacts, arbitration and disarmament, material and moral, still runs the old diplomacy, with its alliances, insurance and reinsurance treaties, balance of power, military values, and the economic theories represented by tariff walls and tariff combinations.&quot;Not merely do the tendencies of old statecraft thus described in last year&apos;s memorandum still continue to disturb international relations; it must be ruefully acknowledged that fluid circumstance conspired during 1930 to solidify these tendencies into something very like factual matter. Above all, the world-wide economic depression of last year has had all over the world its political reper-cussions, and, however different these may be in individual countries, it may be confidently asserted that everywhere they fanned the flame of nationalism, and spread a vague feeling of fear throughout Europe, which in turn extended even to South America. For the first time since the peace people talked of war, foolishly, no doubt, as of a thing no longer unbelievable and impossible. It became once again a possibility in the mind of man, and from what is possible to the next epithet is but a step for imagination. This frame of mind, in so far as it has been induced by economic causes, may pass again when those causes are removed. Meanwhile it has been doing daily mischief, undermining the hopes and ideals of the last decade, and tempting one Government after the other to turn for security to the old weapons of militarism and alliances, to tariff walls and industrial isolation; while in the work of international co-operation and mutual assistance, although all still pay lip-service to these ideals, the popular jealousies, fears and suspicions aroused by material stringencies and economic confusion tend to make it difficult for Governments to commit themselves generously to any broad-minded and far-sighted solution of Europe&apos;s political problems.Thus Hitlerism in Germany and Fascist bellicosity in Italy to take the most glaring examples are in large part symptoms of an economic disease. Public opinion in Germany and Italy, groping for a cure for these ills, has been inclining to turn from schemes of co-operation to national policies that seem to promise quicker and more showy results. Hence the cry for treaty revision, repudiation of reparations, and the formation of diplomatic blocs, all of which were outstanding features in 1930.One of the recent, and more remarkable, of the by-products of the economic depression, with a due admixture of political ingredients, is the proposal for a customs union between Germany and Austria. As a purely economic phenomenon it might, in happier circumstances, have been hailed as a fruit of economic wisdom, and men might have said that in this case at least some good had come out of the evil of the economic depression. But the elements are as a matter of fact so mixed up in the scheme Of these more later that its immediate effect has been to stir up all the qualms and jealousies between the &quot; Haves &quot; and &quot; Have nots &quot; in a degree that threatens far-reaching damage if the scheme materialises in its present form; and even if it is eliminated-or sublimated into something else  it is likely to leave behind it a deposit of wry suspicions.We cannot, then, be blind, in attempting the harvest of a quiet eye, to the other side, which is the growth of this old. Adam; for the dissipated wretch, far from being dissipated altogether, has been actually putting on weight. At his age and ours this seems a strange phenomenon to accompany symptoms like the boom in anti-war literature, striking in bulk, quality and circulation; but it is a fact, and demands &quot; selective attention.&quot; In growing he has forgotten, sometimes wilfully, a great deal and has learnt nothing, not even that in a showery-tempered world the rain of a second far outweighs the sunshine of a century. Most of his recruits never knew the war; and the fiercest rancours are usually felt by those Avho have suffered, but not much. Yet it is not enough to dismiss them as reactionary. It must also be asked against what are they reacting, for that is a sign of vitality; and there are high-minded as well as high-handed people among them.We may begin with the smallest causes of old Adam&apos;s growth. One of them is a press largely in dangerous hands, such as the quintet of puissant brayhards, Hugenberg, Hearst, Rothermere, Beaverbrook, Coty. The standards of journalistic intelligence have risen while the standards of journalism are still low. This, however, is no place for an examination in detail of the influence of the press in modern politics, nor of the question how far the application of the third degree to facts distorts the
minds to which they are in turn applied. It must be added that the influence is in any perhaps in every case easily exaggerated. Even in the spirit of old Adam there is a majority against pulping the tree of knowledge. He owes his buoyancy to many other visible causes, such as the aforesaid economic depression and the disillusionment that is almost the same as, or results directly from, devitalisation. (To this category of phenomena belong the post-war weakening of religion and growth of egotism.) He gains, moreover, from the shortness of unpleasant memory-sensations, and from those countries of the mind where the boundary between reality and filmland is ill-defined. A talkie belief in force and actual recourse to force are, however and happily, two very different things.But, quickly dropping all general considerations, I would point out that his existence is partly due to one plain, political fact -the Peace Treaties of 1919. The part is large; indeed, in politics, the part is sometimes greater than the whole. The world now begins to regret that the democrats of 1919 did not imitate the moderation of the oligarchs of 1814 and 1815. Considering the length and magnitude of the provocation and the spirit of the times, those two acts of restraint stand, as restraint always does, among the all-highest wisdom.^) Statesmen then at least saw that nothing is so intolerable as a martyr, and that whenever old Adam is wrong he will cry out that he is wronged with more than his normal hundred square yards of lung. Now the terms of 1919 went too far, not individually, perhaps, but cumulatively. In the main they were presumably intended to render Germany harmless for so long as possible. It is difficult to understand how they could have been taken for more than a tale, where everybody lived happily ever after for a quite a little while.Surely it is by now plain that the little while is running out. So relatively moderate a person as Dr. Kaas, leader of the Centre party, has stated that &quot; the idea of revision and evolution is alive and will not disappear again from the political agenda.&quot; He has also referred to the housebreaking potentialities of the &quot; German Samson,&quot; not mentioning that Samson was blind. Perhaps an ordinary life-size Gulliver, bound by the threads of Lilliput and liberating his left hand, would be a nearer simile. Germany is, indeed, bound by subscribed principles, and some Nazis have given a disclaimer of intention to violate them. But to their minds principles are not violated; they suffer, or enjoy, a lapse from virtue. As a matter of fact, Germany is already indulging in minor infractions of her disarmament obligations, and would have little difficulty in throwing off more without fear of &quot; sanctions &quot; other than the Lilliputian darts of reproach.Further, after 1918, some people expected the immoral chess of politics to die out; but they have been as wrong as Oapablanca in anticipating the end of the game. The group system, in being among the &quot; haves,&quot; in becoming among the &quot; have-nofs,&quot; gives most unpalatable food for thought. For instance, while French policy has done much to push Italy toward the latter group, France has begun to realise that her group, with the exception of Yugoslavia, is either not worth much for &quot; practical&quot; purposes, as in the cases of Roumania and Czechoslovakia, or may be more of a commitment than an asset, as in the case of Poland. Hence her nerves. And what has been the consequence1? Let me take three quotations among the many that would be possible. &quot;As a result of my recent short trip in Western Europe,&quot; wrote our Ambassador in Berlin, in the latter part of last year, &quot; during which I went both to Rome and Paris, I formed the impression that the international atmosphere is worse now than at any time since the end of the war.&quot; This on the political side. On the economic here, too, all local observers have become more pessimistic I would cite the whole of M. Colijn&apos;s speech of the 14th January, on the project for economic disarmament, with its conclusion : &quot; The picture I have painted is dark.&quot; I need hardly say that this conclusion is widespread in financial circles everywhere. On the side of spiritual apprehension, the Pope, in an address this last Christmas, pointed out that it was difficult for peace to prevail between the nations if there were to be a reign and diffusion of &quot;an egoistic and unbending nationalism,&quot; which he defined as &quot; hatred and envy in place of a mutual desire for good, suspicion in place of fraternal confidence, competition in place of co-operation, ambitions for hegemony and empire in place of respect for and protection of all rights, including those of the weak and small.&quot; One side of these balanced phrases is pure pre-war.   The nations of Europe still tend, in(&apos;) &quot; Nothing that could instigate France to another war ought, in Wellington^ view, to be imposed upon her.&quot;   British Foreign Secretaries. .
Whistler&apos;s phrase, to be overcome by an undue sense of right from which the Holy Father himself is not exempt in respect of Malta.The preceding paragraphs are plain speaking, for facts cannot be grasped without facing them. But the picture, with all deference to M. Colijn, must be a complete one. Let us, therefore, get away from any suggestion of undue alarm. There is at present no more than cause for grave preoccupation, for all that Homo Sapiens is still liable to palaeolithic homesickness. There is all the difference in the world between hostility and hostilities. The general desire to avoid war is increasingly and encouragingly strong, and common sense is not so slow a traveller as the cynics suppose. Even in Germany the Zeitgeist is dualised for our comfort, and the Socialists are still by much the largest individual party though the revisionary ferment is in the midst of them also, and the editor of the &quot; Vorwarts &apos;&apos; can talk like a Junker when heated to the requisite temperature. There are also those normal beings who are not AristotkVs &quot;political animal,&quot; and would be sufficiently interested in beer, breeding and good health to feel no draught from the Polish Corridor, unless they were constantly reminded of it. The rival Latin Eves too, for all the alarmists who may whisper that they are at the mercy of a frontier incident, will long halt between the slogans &quot; Eat More Fruit&quot; and &quot; Safety First,&quot; even though the wrath of Latins is not, as so often hoped, of the soupe au lait variety; they not only get cross quickly, they stay there. We have employed much dubiously requited endeavour in their importantly trivial naval controversy to persuade them to look at each other less like two china dogs on a mantelpiece. I am the first to admit that old Adam is no laughing matter, but he must be taken with a grain of salt, as well as with that blessed word o-rrovBaLOTrps, or &quot; appropriate-seriousness.&quot; And we must take account of, and make allowance for, the effect upon judgment of the wave of pessimism that has been sweeping the world and is still far from spent.All the same, 1930 was a disappointing year. We had hoped that evacuation, commercialisation of reparations, and the freeing of Germany from economic control, would produce a detente. The Germans, missing a great opportunity for silence, promptly opened their mouths wider than ever, a tendency that received great impetus from the elections; and as one shouts so is the echo. Italo-Yugoslav conversations were resumed at Geneva, but there is no definite change as yet to chronicle in their relations, for which the fault lies mainly with Italy; and there had been little change in Franco-Italian relations, for which the fault is less easily distributable, until escape was sought from the word &quot; parity,&quot; which acts as a red rag to a bull or a Latin tag to a backbencher. Signor Mussolini cannot escape responsibility for his year of lamentable spate. His qualities of greatness, aside from finance and foreign affairs, are incontestable, but, with an eye to France, it may indeed be said : &quot; There is so much danger in talking that a man strictly wise can hardly be called a sociable creature.&quot; Again, however, the bark is worse than the bite though much barking is a weariness of the neighbours nerves and there is, moreover, nothing new in this; Franco-Italian relations have long been a hunting-ground of old feuds, unaffected by change of personalities, where men who are equal to the same thing are unequal to one another.f) It must be added that, in Sir Ronald Graham&apos;s opinion, there was some slow progress in the right direction during 1930, though with almost equal retracing of steps. Nothing has happened to cause radical modification of last year&apos;s views; but recent months have seen an undefined, and perhaps undemonstrable, awakening to &quot; the fact that in international co-operation lies the only hope of salvation.&quot;The background thus adumbrated will be filled in by the following pages, and in the conclusion it may be possible to make some suggestions. But, before passing to the first chapter, a last word may be repeated. During the last year, on many sides, there was too much stout intellectual unwillingness, too much persistence in old mental frameworks and fireworks, above all, too loose chattering of war. The homing flocks of Americans were noticeably affected this autumn, as were also some visitors from the Dominions. This chattering our represen-tatives abroad have received instructions to combat; but, harmful as it is, we must take it less literally than the Americans, for monkeys still seek the lofty sentiment of the tree-top, which preserved and developed our species when carnivores were abroad.(-) E.g., &quot; Als Bismarck und nach ihm Caprivi-Holstein dem Wunsche Crispis, bald zu einer griindlichen Auseinandersetzung mit dem in Italien damals sehr verhassten Franlueich zu kommen, kiihl und ablehnend begegneten . . . .&quot; Billow:  &quot; Denkwvirdigkeiten,&quot; vol. I.
2.-POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE EUROPEAN  SITUATION.In the political sphere the outstanding factor during 1930 was the develop-ment of the cleavage which splits Europe into the two camps already mentioned. It will be convenient, therefore, to treat States under three headings the anti-revisionists, the revisionists and the &quot;onlookers.(A.)-ANTI-REVISIONIST COUNTRIES.It is obvious that the policy of France and her followers, who constitute the anti-revisionist camp, is of necessity less spectacular than that of their rivals. By its very nature a conservative policy is opposed to sensationalism, being based on the status quo, which it is the dream of the opposite camp to upset. For this reason the casual reader of the press and how else can it be read might Avell incline to believe that the policy of the revisionist group provides the most squinting examples of the old diplomacy, and that France and the Little Entente are no more stained with archaism than a. year ago. Only by analysing French policy during the last twelve months can it be ascertained how far this belief is warranted by the facts.(i) France.Last year in my survey I stated that France&apos;s one objective is security and ever more security, and that to achieve this end she was working on the following lines  &quot; (1) She will continue to work for the &apos; putting of teeth&apos; into the Kellogg Pact, and, more particularly, for some insurance against Italy;(2) She will try to divert Germany from a dangerous foreign policy by offering to co-operate with her in the political sphere;(3) She will try to mitigate Germany&apos;s predominance in the economic sphere by means of industrial co-operation;(4) She will advocate the &apos; f ederalisation of Europe &apos; ;But if these attempts fail, or, indeed, if they do not appear on further experience to give France the same degree of security as her present system of alliances and armaments, she will be tempted to treat them merely as passing experiments, and will rely as heretofore for her real defence on(5) Her traditional system of alliances with Poland and the Little Entente; and(6) The further development of her alliance with Yugoslavia so as to &apos; contain&apos; Italy.&quot;Of the attempt to put teeth into the Kellogg Pact little has been heard of late, which may be taken to mean that France has begun to realise that it is a policy unlikely to succeed, and therefore to be abandoned. On the other hand there is at her disposal the more promising policy of amending the League Covenant so as to bring it into harmony Avith the Kellogg Pact. By such amend-ment those wars which are at present permissible under the Covenant would be placed under its ban, and become subject to the system of League sanctions provided for in such case. The Kellogg Pact, although still without teeth of its own, would nevertheless by this method be fitted out with a serviceable set of League dentures. Would France be satisfied with this substitute? The answer is doubtful. President Doumergue&apos;s speech of the 8th April is, in fact, ominously definite on this point. So long as the League cannot wield &quot; sanctions &quot; in the form of guns and rifles, so long will France have to keep her own powder dry. If the League is disarmed then must needs France be armed. An unpromising and familiar argument! In every walk of life it is a strong French trait to run great risks by not running small ones; and the course of the last fifteen months of naval negotiation is a fair illustration of the point.As to Franco-German co-operation, it will be seen from last year&apos;s memorandum that no great hope was entertained of feelers by a precautionary suitor to a sullen dame. Any attempt to co-operate politically with Germany has been checked by the growth of the Hitler party and the subsequent and consequent
outcry in the German press for moratorium, rearmament, revision of the frontiers. As if this was not enough, Mussolini also must needs raise the revisionary cry-last autumn, although he clearly does not quite -if at all know what he means. Perhaps there was no greater desire to make new boundaries than to hit old rivals over the pavilion. In any case it aroused all France&apos;s latent suspicion of &quot; encirclement &quot; that ominous pre-war word and cast a chill over any further approaches to Berlin. It also delayed for the best or worst part of six months our endeavours to get France and Italy even talking of naval disarmament.To return to Franco-German co-operation, bad as were the prospects last year, they have now been made worse by Germany&apos;s sudden production  lamentably adamite in method of the customs union with Austria. This sudden and clumsy move by Germany has shaken France badly worse, indeed, than she has been shaken for a long time and if Poincare and other recidivistes have their way, she might in her present mood relapse into something perilously verging on her old attitude of blockading Germany. For France from M. Herriot to M. Poincare the proposed Austro-German customs union is purely, simply and entirely a political move, the first step to the Anschluss and must be fought as such. Thus the whole of Europe, against maybe its better judgment, in any case by a bitter paradox, is being forced to treat what can be represented as the first step towards European federation as an objectionable political manoeuvre destined to wreck the peace of Europe.The delicate state of French nerves was then further illustrated by the pettish reception of news that the German Chancellor and Minister for Foreign affairs had been invited to visit England before the League Council meeting at which the customs union was to be discussed. M. Briand had approved the visit, but the country denounced it as a betrayal. That public opinion should instinctively relapse over such a trifling incident into the per fide Albion mood is a state of mind that we must recognise. The same symptom immediately cropped up when Italy&apos;s first instinct on the French naval boggle was to bite us ! This may be all pretty Fanny&apos;s way, but we could wish her quit of old-world frills and vapours.After saying so much about Franco-German political co-operation, it would seem vain repetition to say much on France&apos;s third aim industrial co-operation with Germany. Long before the present situation arose progress had been stationary. German exports had increased and French exports to Germany had declined rather alarmingly from 1927 onwards; and it began to be felt that Germany, &quot;over-rationalised, over-producing, over-breeding and overdrawn,&quot; had overreached France in commercial treaty-making. The Saar mine negotiations, too, which at one time looked hopeful, had broken down, and in the purely industrial sphere the European cartel, to which both France and Germany belong, is struggling with serious difficulties. On the top of all this comes the projected Austro-German customs union almost enough to quench the last glimmerings of co-operation. But perhaps we are taking too short a view in looking only at its present havoc. It is, after all, not impossible that this ill wind may act, not as an extinguisher, but a bellows on the embers of economic co-operation I had almost said economic security not merely as between France and Germany, but for all Europe. It will depend on who gets there first the statesmen of Europe with the bellows or old Adam with the extinguisher. It will be an interesting and important race.This brings us conveniently to France&apos;s (or rather M. Briand&apos;s) fifth article of policy, the f ederalisation or union of Europe. The hopes I have indulged in as regards co-operation are, I am afraid, all that I can offer in respect of M. Briand&apos;s ambitious but intangible scheme for unifying Europe. The more&apos;s the pity. Since last year&apos;s memorandum was written various committees have been busy discussing it, but the net result has been that it was damned with faint praise by all the Powers to whom it was submitted, and the prospect of its materialising into any security system which would satisfy France is so far decidedly meagre. The cynical are, of course, now saying that the Germans  not without Schadenfreude have intentionally hoisted M. Briand with his own petard by formulating this definite unionist policy.In a word, far from helping M. Briand in his policy of appeasement and stabilisation, both Germany and Italy have, during the last year, in their various ways developed their offensive against the status quo, and there are many in France who say that had M. Briand been a less &quot;good European&quot; they would not have dared thus to threaten France&apos;s security. The fact is that, although M. Briand still holds the helm and indeed weathered last year&apos;s storm, his policy has, in the course of the voyage, received a severe buffeting.   Moreover,
the weather is still stormy. The customs union with all its implications, not to mention the Disarmament Conference and its preliminaries, are going to be productive of some stiff squalls. It is not surprising, therefore, that France should be keeping in trim that alternative policy of hers, which she is always careful to have in reserve : the policy of purely military defence and her system of alliances, especially her use of Yugoslavia to &quot;contain&quot; Italy.In addition to furbishing her alliances, France is not neglecting the purely material aspect of her defences. Although, on the one hand, she has reduced her military service to one year, on the other she has spent  30 million on the fortification of her eastern frontier, including that with Italy. Old Adam lurks not only in the shadow of economic nationalism; he is still digging himself in among concrete pill-boxes surrounded by uncompromising barbed wire.As for the system of alliances, if M. Briand&apos;s liberal policy had carried any deep conviction we should probably have seen a weakening of French interest in these pawns of the old skin-game. As it is, although there may have been no spectacular tightening of the bonds, there has also been no relaxation. France has been as active as ever in the use of propaganda to strengthen the bonds of allegiance that unite her with her allies. Loans and blue generals are constantly emitted, war memorials unveiled, banquets assimilated in defence of the status quo. Nor have the satellite States been behindhand in treading the new path? more delicately than the old.(ii) Yugoslavia.From the French point of view Yugoslavia is the most important link in the chain of alliances. Mussolini has, indeed, described the Franco-Yugoslav Treaty as a pistol pointed at the heart of Italy. This is, of course, in the tone of old-fashioned melodrama; but the existence of this treaty, and still more its implications, are on any view a considerable factor in preventing normal and neighbourly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. For -the latter there have all along been three courses open -honourable independence and reliance on the League of Nations, dependence on France, or subservience to Italy. At one time it had been hoped that she would adopt the first, but any such tendency was rudely checked during the last year by a wave of panic which hustled Yugoslavia into further reliance on France. It would not be particularly useful to analyse at length the causes of this sudden fear, among which equivocal dilatoriness on the part of Italy and suspect mating on the part of King Boris may be cited. One of its immediate results, however, was that Yugoslavia broke off loan negotiations with an international group headed by Messrs. Rothschild it must be admitted that she had the justification of some delay here and applied direct to the Paris market for the means of stabilisation and development. It is feared that in their present frame of mind the Yugoslav Government will interpret the word &apos;&apos; development&apos;&apos; in some terms of armament and munition factory.It is in Yugoslavia also that last year saw the most manifest provincialism in Time of Old Adam. The occasion was the proposed amendment of the Covenant, which was frankly opposed by M. Marinkovitch one of the best minds in the country on the ground that it would make it impossible for Yugoslavia to avail herself of article 15, paragraph 7, in order to go to war with Bulgaria over the Macedonian question.Of the Macedonian problem (as described in last year&apos;s memorandum under the heading &quot; Bulgaria&quot;) all that can be said is that the patient still remains  in liverish company to be cured by some troubling of waters, and that meanwhile he will at any rate continue to be a possible germ-carrier, not merely in the Balkans but in Europe. It is true that during the last year &quot;incidents&quot; between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have been fewer and less dangerous than in previous years, and that gratifying progress has been made toward a settlement of the vexed question of Bulgaro-Yugoslav mixed properties. Yet, though frontier conditions be more normal, we may expect, so soon as it serves the purpose of the uncontrollable Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, who secretly control the fate of the unfortunate Macedonian peasantry, to be shocked by some new outrage. So at least say the local gunmen, unless their milder members can deliver the goods quickly. The latent, or inherent, trouble is aggravated by the fact that the dearth of men in Europe is most marked in the Balkans proper, and in Bulgaria in particular. To this there may be a retort that it is the calibre of circumstances, and not of men, that has altered.[5185] c
(iii) Poland.The second pillar of France&apos;s treaty edifice is Poland. A year ago signs were not wanting that Poland was beginning to grow restive under French tutelage, and to feel herself strong enough to strike out a policy of her own; but the events of the past year, both outside and within her frontiers, have caused a return to the old position.As in the other countries ruled by dictators, the economic crisis, which affected Poland with increasing severity during the year, had the effect of discrediting the Government politically as well as economically. The opposition to Marshal Pilsudski, seemingly paralysed a year ago by the apparent material successes of his regime, raised its head again, and the Dictator soon felt that he must fight for his political life. He appealed to the country and &quot;made&quot; elections a widespread industry as ruthlessly as he dared. At this juncture the Nationalist agitation in Germany gave him the chance to beat the patriotic drum; and his agents in Upper Silesia beat it, and the local Germans  who resented it the more that they used to do the same in &quot; better &quot; days to such effect that the Polish Government had to face serious charges of man-handling the minorities treaties. A similar situation has arisen with the Ukrainian minority in Eastern Galicia and is a symptom of the same internal strain. Simultaneously, the perennial disputes between Poland and Danzig are again coming to a head, and the general discussion of the Corridor question, covert even in France, has further alarmed and irritated both Marshal Pilsudski&apos;s Govern-ment and Polish public opinion.The Poles, in fact, are now in a thoroughly nervous state. Their national character is such that this nervousness only makes them the more obstinate and uncompromising in all questions at issue with their neighbours, the less inclined to consider alternatives to reliance on armed force and French support.(iv) Roumania.There remain Czechoslovakia and Roumania. Of the latter little need be said, except that to her allies, France and Poland, she is more of a liability than an asset on account of her inefficiency and weakness, more especially since rumours of a Bolshevik invasion of Bessarabia cause recurrent staggers. This fear is more than likely to be realised in time : Soviet concentration and large orders for flying boats in the Black Sea point in this eventual direction,, apart from ordinary political antennae. Meanwhile the return of crapulous Carol has been less the auspice of a better age than was hoped at first, and comprehensible, blush. The last Roumanian loan cost him 10 per cent. Financial France one of the several Frances is not susceptible to political tenderness.(v) Czechoslovakia.As for Czechoslovakia, &quot; the arsenal of the Little Entente &quot; with a talent for making enemies as well as munitions, she still continues her quarrels with Hungary, and her coldnesses elsewhere, besides generating some anti-German heat which comes to curious detonations. The ostensible reason was the showing of German films; the underlying cause is probably fear of Germany&apos;s recrudescence. Czechoslovakia, like Poland, has an uneasy feeling that she is no longer France&apos;s pet, or even reliably her protege, and that she might one day find herself abandoned by her ally, if the latter were to continue her policy of understanding with Germany and European federalisation. This has made for disquiet which, far from conducing to restraint, takes the form of nagging at neighbours and petty outbursts of &apos;hate.&quot;An instance of this is the occasion over which the somewhat waning M. Benes waxed so hot last autumn to wit, the coming of age of the callow Archduke Otto. He was convinced that the event would bring about the restoration of the Habsburgs at Budapest, and he excitedly reminded the Great Powers that they had in 1921, in very different circumstances, extracted! from Hungary an undertaking not to do so. If a restoration were now attempted, he threatened, Czechoslovakia would at once close her frontiers and break off relations; and if the League Council failed to give her what she wanted, she would
go to war with Hungary. No restoration was, of course, attempted-whatever the future may hold and M. Benes&apos;s menaces did not materialise. There is room for reflection when the jeune premier of the League still finds it necessary to treat the internal administration of another member as a casus belli and manages partly to stampede his associates. It is to be hoped that the Powers may shortly be disengaged from such early post-diluvian entanglements, and the matter remitted where it properly belongs to the League.But what has naturally upset poor M. Benes more than anything else has been this threat of an Austro-German Customs Union. His hysterical speeches have displayed a mixture of remorse that he had not prevented! it by himself creating a Danubian union, of wounded pride that he should have been jockeyed into the undignified position which might eventually force Czechoslovakia to join the German union and, last but not least, of fear lest this should be the beginning of a new German Drang nach Osten. One may smile at his wounded pride, but his remorse and his fear are justified. Czechoslovakia^ position  geographic and economic is such that her lot would be unpleasant and perhaps untenable, if Germany and Austria were united commercially. A S.O.S. has been sent to Paris to save Czech independence and France is fully alive to the importance of responding to the call. It is the manner of her response which is going to be instructive.(vi) Belgium.Belgium is usually considered as within the French orbit, and it is certainly true to say that France regards Belgium as her first line of defence in a war with Germany. At the same time, France cannot be sure that Belgium&apos;s path in the continuum will be as regular as that of the other satellites. At the moment there is a fall in French stock in Belgium, and the present Coalition Government have made it clear that they do not intend to be dragged into conflict at France&apos;s chariot-wheels. Such a declaration of independence is the easier since there are really few charioteers in France. M. Jaspar and other Belgian politicians have informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels that Belgium&apos;s responsibilities in the international sphere are absolutely limited to those engendered by the Covenant, the Treaty of Locarno and the Pact of Paris; and that the Franco-Belgian Military Agreement can only be invoked in the case of unprovoked aggression by Germany, each party maintaining the right to decide for itself whether such a casus belli has arisen. A Socialist Government under M. Vandervelde would take a similar line. Belgium, too, is preoccupied with spending, but not heavily, on frontier defence. In general, she is showing more reliance on the League of Nations, but French influence is still strong, and it is uncertain whether Belgium, in a crisis, would be able to resist the gravitational force of France.This brief survey shows, I think, that in the anti-revisionist camp circumstances during the past year Shave, on the whole, favoured the revival of the diplomatic methods of the old Adam. We must be thankful that the policy of these Powers has not, in practice, deteriorated further; but continuance of the present pressure, unless safety-valves be found, is bound to create an atmosphere native to him. This brings us to the revisionist Powers, for it is they who are now chiefly straining the international relationships of Europe.(B.) REVISIONIST COUNTRIES.It is in the revisionist camp that during the past year the most important changes have occurred, changes exerting a profound influence on the whole of Europe. The occupants of this camp are Germany and the lesser ex-enemy Powers on the one hand, and Italy on the other.(i) Germany.In last year&apos;s memorandum I wrote that Germany was at the beginning of a new epoch. How was she going to proceed ? &quot; Is she about to concentrate her efforts deliberately and openly on the Polish question and rearmament, or is it safe to assume that, although these be her goals, she will rather, for the timef5185] c 2
being, not show her hand, but devote herself to internal consolidation, meanwhile participating in any current schemes of international co-operation without committing herself politically ? The answer probably is that it is too soon to judge, and that Germany herself does not know.&quot;The German elections have now given the answer. The rise of the National Socialists shows that, even if the Germans still do not know what they do want, they know full well what they don&apos;t want: &quot; We do not want the new Europe to be built on the foundation of Germany&apos;s greatest downfall.&quot; East year, in dealing with the National Socialists, I said that &quot; under the leadership of the ridiculously dangerous demagogue Hitler, they make the best or worst of both worlds, preach a combination of militant socialism and militant nationalism, with uncompromising hostility to the peace settlement and the policy of fulfilment. Incidentally, they are almost fanatically anti-Erench, and have strong sympathies with the Italian Fascists.&quot; Apart from other sounds of feline flirtation, it was noticeable that their Christmas messages from the housetops contained something of the same plangent ill-will towards men.Last May they were still feeble, though the results of the local elections led to the notion that they were waxing. The warrant for this belief was found by the general election of September 1930, the most significant feature of which was the Nazi avalanche. Their success at the polls may be largely attributed to economic depression and youth&apos;s light head, filled from vindictive and distorted text-books, to which 6 vddcov fxdOcov is a stranger; it need not necessarily be inter-preted to mean that so large a block of the country favours a provocative foreign policy in the immediate future, though, one way and another, there was an incontestable vote of eleven millions against constitutional government. The &quot;serious outbreaks of savagery&quot; in German internal politics vide the Government&apos;s latest proclamation are, however, already almost sufficient to confirm Treitschke. It may be admitted that the Nazi rise corresponds with the rise of emotionalism in Homo Sapiens, and that part of Nazi audiences goes to meetings as to a cinema by payment. A foreigner can, indeed, pay more than stall prices for a &quot; good &quot; meeting, that is, one where old Adam is raising Cain to some tune. But it would be difficult and idle to speculate what proportion of Nazi voter should be taken at his ugly face-value. Let it suffice for the moment that the success of the Nazis provides yet another example of the evil produced by the world-wide economic crisis on European politics. And as political Germany a country easily irrigated with mirage by an extremity of bovarysm acts up to a cultivated conviction of war-innocence, so, economically, she &quot; carries on &quot; as though she were the only pebble on the beach of adversity. She is, indeed, as &quot; difficult &apos; to satisfy as that imperious female need of sympathy when the male has been kept waiting. Yet patience is necessary in both cases if life is to be peaceful.It is obvious that the next few months will be of the greatest importance to Hitler, for on his behaviour during this period will depend his ultimate success or failure, whatever we or he may mean by those words. He has retired from the parliamentary arena, and has declined to support the Stahlhelm in their proposal for a referendum in Prussia, on the ground that it was too risky and might still further discredit his party. Everything now hangs on what line of policy he proposes to adopt. At the moment it would appear that he has not yet made up his mind.Evidence is not lacking that the Nazis are beginning to lose ground with the older people, in the districts such as Thuringia where they had had their greatest success; but they are continually opening up new and hitherto untouched areas, where the parents have not as yet taken alarm at the excesses of their offspring. As a whole their membership is still increasing.After the astounding success of the Nazis in the September elections, Germany (both Government and people) was in some sort hypnotised, and it required time for this feeling of helplessness to wear off. The Government have now realised the weakness of tlhe Nazis in the Reichstag; while the Republicans are taking a leaf from the Nazi book, and have organised a counter-movement under men who have discovered that they too can preach to crowds. All this entitles one to believe that the Nazis are slowly being forced into the defensive. They are rent internally, owing to the divergences between their tacticians and their thick-ear brigade-e.g., the quarrel between Hitler and Captain Stennes  they are in a bad way financially, and a drift is setting towards communism. (Some of their most bitter and fuddled partisans have already landed themselves there; one whole block was really never anywhere else.)   A revolution on the
defensive cannot succeed and, though the speed with which the situation changes in Germany makes prophecy not only difficult but dangerous, we may perhaps draw the not too adventurous conclusion that the tide has turned and that from now on Hitler and his followers, unless they can find some fresh appeal to German emotionalism, will slowly but surely lose ground. The Nazis would be, however, likely to decline for many months before there was any chance of their falling, and we cannot, therefore, put them out of our minds.Indeed, it would be shortsighted not to give a nuisance its due. We must admit frankly that there is an element of idealism or aspiration in the Hitler movement which can be summed up in the words so often used by his supporters, &quot; Es muss anders werden,&quot; or, in Kultur jargon, &quot; to conform to the criteria of the present is to risk racial existence.&quot; That is what the Duce also says without knowing what &quot; anders &quot; means. (It means that old Adam clamours at one and the same time for change and national immutabilities.) The movement represents an accentuation and acceleration of the movement towards freedom and equality. The aspiration to these nouns, which plainer people call a grievance, has come to stay, and is an element which every German and perhaps every other Government must take into account. It is bound, indeed has already begun, to exercise an unhealthy and contagious influence on the conduct of Germany&apos;s foreign policy.We have said above that the tide of Nazism appears to be on the turn, but Hitler&apos;s power for evil will not be exhausted for that. &quot; The evil that men do lives after them,&quot; and his propaganda is already giving a more or less permanent twist to public affairs. (It is worth while to devote five minutes to meditation upon the significance of the banning of &quot; All Quiet on the Western Front.&quot;) (s) It will probably take years to undo the effects of his influence, which may well endure long after the causes of the original warp have faded into the limbo of forgotten things. Though the causes be no longer remembered, national thought in Germany may continue to be perverted by the doctrines, until at last the doctrines themselves are distorted beyond all recognition. &quot; Men fight and lose the battle, and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat; and when it comes it turns out to be not what they meant, and other men have to fight for what they meant under another name.&quot; So it may well be with the Nazis.Discount it as we may, make every allowance for the German genius for doing the wrong thing and for making the worst of all possible worlds no wonder Voltaire ragged Leibnitz the outburst against the statics quo, coming as it did immediately after the evacuation of the Rhineland, is not reassuring. We had hoped that the evacuation would serve as a sedative : it has acted as an appetiser. Second helpings of experience are best avoided by better table-manners ; and the sudden appearance of Germany as Oliver Twist has naturally and seriously alarmed French public opinion, bringing, as has been said above, to an abrupt end most attempts at Franco-German co-operation. Even less reassuring is the whole manner, more characteristic of &quot; as far back as 1911 &quot;  an expression which I recently came across in a scientific work than of 1931, in which the scheme for the customs union with Austria was prepared in secret, and then announced with a suddenness and inopportunism which one would almost say were calculated if one did not know the Germans.There is, however, a more satisfactory side to the picture. In the previous memorandum it was stated that there was no outstanding personality in sight to educate public opinion and exercise a controlling influence over foreign policy. Since these words were written, however, Dr. Briining has risen to the occasion, and has shown himself a politician of no mean skill. Even that straightbackward Prussian Junker, Herr von Oldenburg Januschau, has described him as the first real Chancellor since Bismarck though the praise is not as high as it sounds. So long as the depression continues tub-thumpers, and all those with whom moral courage is indistinguishable from self-advertisement, will have eager audiences; but the Governments hand will be immeasurably strengthened if ,a revival of prosperity comes. Of any such revival there is as yet no sign, but there are faint encouraging symptoms of returning confidence.Meanwhile, in the political turmoil, how far have the aims of German foreign policy undergone modification during the last twelve months?   In the previous(3) &quot; The 1914 spirit (not so deeply hidden as might have been thought) was allowed to flare up for an unguarded moment. It was quickly shut away again, but the brief betrayal of this spirit in unexpected quarters was impressive and not easily to be forgotten:&quot; The Berlin correspondent of the &quot;Times.&quot;
memorandum they were set out in inverse order of importance and urgency as follows: (a) The re-establishment of Germany as a world power, i.e., acquisition of colonies and mandates.(b) The &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria.(c) Rearmament, so as to obtain at least parity with Poland.(d) Drastic modification of her Polish frontier that is, the Polish corridor.(a) The colonial question is still only a distant ideal. Indeed, there are indications that colonial propaganda is to a large extent artificial and moribund. The German colonists are not discontented with British methods of government, and the urgency and importance of the European situation have forced the colonial question, at least temporarily, into the background.(b) There is no reason to alter the opinion previously expressed that a political &quot;Anschluss&quot; has lost some of its attractiveness, or anyhow its immediacy, in German eyes, while even in Austria it is at the moment less to the fore. The German Ambassador recently informed me, with some emphasis and exaggera-tion, that 90 per cent, of political Germany was now against the &quot; Anschluss,&quot; seeing the accretion of Socialists and Catholics and nothing else that Austria would bring to the already well-stocked Reichstag.In the face of such assurances, what are we to make of the sudden policy of the customs union with Austria ? As to the motives, I believe simply perhaps very simply that Dr. Curtius was, as Lord Granville said of Lord John. Russell, &quot;dying to connect his name with something.&quot; I believe also that the plan was conceived, in some German minds at least, as a measure of economic defence against Russia &quot; before Soviet economic pressure becomes too strong.&quot; I do not believe that Austria cried &quot; Come over into Macedonia and help us&quot; though Germany may need Vienna for a bridge into the Balkans for the simple reason that all Austrian finance and a great part of Austrian industry were so unpleasantly taken aback by the news. Nor do I personally believe that this coup was conceived, or is intended, as any preface or approach to a political &quot;Anschluss.&quot; But those who anxiously contend that it would facilitate any such eventual intention have an incontrovertible case. In any event, what is most significant is that such things are still possible, are still thought clever or essential there are many who secretly agree with this last adjective and are still capable of seriously disturbing the equanimity and equipoise of Europe. The boat has already rocked enough to leave a nasty taste in the mouth of its occupants I had almost said its inmates. But the mischief does not end there. The Secretary of State&apos;s wise and reasonable proposal for fitting reference to the League Council where dispassionate discussion might have extricated both parties without loss of face or temper met, though ultimately accepted, with an early reception by the German Government, which to most people had but one implication, or at least was so interpreted : Germany has not the League spirit. Unilateral and petulant affirmation of rectitude still seemed to her sufficient on the part of a Great Power. She may get over this unaffected pre-war tone, and acquire at least the manners of the League that she growls of leaving if it does not give her all she wants.(&apos;*) (There is a touch of blackmail in this.) Meanwhile, we shall be playing ostrich if we do not heed her hints of scepticism and her symptoms of infidelity.The test of Germany&apos;s true character will come at the forthcoming discussion of the customs union in the Committee on European Union. She can use the occasion to press for an international policy of economic reform, or she can use it in order, by process of blackmail, to try and advance Germany&apos;s political aims under cover of economics. The choice she makes will be illuminating and momentous.(c) The recent meeting of the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament had interesting results as regards the last two items on the German programme, rearmament and revision of the eastern frontier. The negative attitude of certain Powers in the matter of disarmament caused a wave of indignation to pass over Germany. There is little doubt that revision of the eastern frontier has, if only temporarily, taken second place, and that rearmament is now the first aim of German policy. Rearmament is perhaps a misleading term; &quot; undisarmament &quot; would be a better way of expressing the state of mind which,(&apos;*) If the customs union meets with too strong opposition, Germany may declare that, if not allowed to help herself, others must help her; and, so saying, raise the reparations question, adding perhaps that &quot; the economic distress of Europe is due to her mutilation.&quot;
while not aiming specifically at increasing the German army or reviving conscription, does very definitely rebel against continuance of the inequality between disarmed Germany and her armed neighbours. Germany is preparing to argue that since the ex-Allies (notably France and Poland) have not carried out the general undertaking to disarm embodied in the Treaty of Versailles, she herself is no longer under obligation to continue in a disarmed state. Feeling on the subject ran high, and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Reichstag passed two motions, the first requesting the Government to urge other nations to disarm, the second asking that the German representative on the Preparatory Disarmament Commission be withdrawn, in view of the refusal of the majority of the members to fulfil their disarmament obligations. Threats irresponsible, no doubt have again been uttered that Germany will leave the League, if the coming conference does not secure a measure of general disarmament which she considers adequate.It is doubtful whether the German Government have at the moment any clear intention as usual, they are playing the game of &quot;wait and see.&quot; A definite policy of rearmament, with a new generation that knows not conscription and a social democracy on the look-out for militarism, would raise all sorts of thorny problems at home, and is not therefore to be lightly started. But public opinion is becoming increasingly embittered by delay in effecting any general measure of disarmament, and failure of the Disarmament Conference would certainly be the occasion of a diplomatic offensive by the German Government. It is not suggested that they would necessarily tear up the military clauses of the treaty and start rearming, but they certainly would try to place the ex-Allied Powers in an impossible position by demanding the revision of Part V of the treaty. In fact, not without cause, such failure would be hailed by Germany as proof positive of the resurrection of the old Adam which would justify indeed force her to cease paying even lip service to the new dispensation.(d) As for the Polish frontier, no German is supposed to forget the lost provinces; in any case he is not allowed to try. In this the Poles are unwise enough to collaborate. Apart from the grievances of the German minority, moreover, Germany is well aware that Polonisation proceeds so rapidly that unless something is done she will soon have a worse case, for she is being outbred. (To patriots, not to parents, breeding is competitive.) But to obtain her ends even by peaceful means Germany knows that she requires military strength and possibly co-operation with Russia. Of both these considerations, therefore, she will not lose sight.For these reasons it may be said with some certainty that the two main objects of German policy (undisarmament and suppression of the Danzig corridor) will be run in double harness. Since Germany is above all an opportunist, they will, however, be driven in tandem, first one and then the other being leader, as occasion warrants. It may even warrant one being put behind the cart for a while. Opportunism is no crime in itself we practise it ourselves without qualm but in the present German frame of mind it is apt to prove a pretext for considerable use of the old methods. This apprehension is bound to create a feeling of unrest and anxiety in Poland and, through Poland, in France.In addition to the four aims of German policy examined in the foregoing paragraphs, one new question of considerable importance has arisen, which has even threatened to take first place in the German programme. This is the demand for the abolition of the Young plan or at least for a moratorium. There has been considerable popular agitation in this connexion, fanned of course by the National Socialists, but it seems based rather on emotion than on understanding of the economic and financial position of the country. There is a very natural tendency to attribute the economic crisis, from which Germany is at present suffering, to the burden of the plan, and to ignore the fact that it is not confined to Germany. Dr. Curfius has on several occasions made it clear that, if the emergency programme fails to establish German finance securely, it may become necessary for Germany to claim a moratorium and even the revision of the Young plan. If the economic crisis shows no early sign of abatement it is possible that the moratorium will again loom large on the German programme, on which it occupies at the moment only a temporary place.In the light of the foregoing analysis there is no reason to modify the view previously expressed that the first criterion which Germany will apply in her foreign policy will be: &quot;How far will this assist me in getting the Polish frontier altered and in freeing myself from the disarmament clauses of the Peace Treaty?&quot;   She has in no way altered the essentials of her programme; she has
merely given proof that her patience is wearing thin, and the internal political developments in the country show that there has been a sudden growth of public opinion, which holds that it is in Germany&apos;s interests to look to the methods of the old Adam if a settlement of these major problems is much longer postponed.There are no important additions to be made to what has already been written about the lesser ex-enemy countries. Austria alone of the three has been comparatively calm until she was suddenly dragged into the limelight by Germany, who to make a shrewd guess exploited a sudden panic in Vienna in order to suggest the customs union as the only way for Austria to escape another economic collapse. Austria may have uttered the word, but it was Germany who coined it.Hungary still uncompromisingly demands back her old territories and once has murmured of leaving the League, aping perhaps some German scepticism of the League&apos;s capacity to &quot; make good &quot; (for &quot; good &quot; read &quot; restitution &quot;).Bulgaria, with equally adamite obstinacy, but with less frankness, watches for the occasion to recover those Macedonian territories which she has coveted in vain since 1878. So long as these thwarted ambitions and bitter grievances remain, both countries will fall an easy prey to attempts made by Italy to organise them into at least &quot; a diplomatic coalition &quot; she has in fact supplied them both with arms as well to counteract the weight of the Little Entente. There is no lack of evidence at the present time that Italy is seriously contemplating the execution of this typical piece of eighteenth century states-craft. Nor, incidentally, is her idea of an Italian-Greek-Turkish agreement calculated to reassure France.Though an ex-Allied Power, Italy now definitely belongs to the revisionist, group. Her position is best illustrated by a quotation from the memorandum of the 1st May last: &apos;&quot; Italy has a certain affinity with the ex-enemy countries, inasmuch as she considers herself to have been robbed of her rights by the Peace Treaties. This gives to her policy a querulous and restless character which one would expect to find among the vanquished rather than among the victors. This feeling of frustration no doubt helped to engender the Fascist regime. Although, since Mussolini&apos;s advent to power, Italy&apos;s foreign policy has acquired a decided aggressiveness, it still seems occasionally to lack coherent objectives; or, to put it in another way, the objectives of Italian policy are so frequently modified, and altered that, while the methods have a fallacious dash of Bismarck, they often have also the ajjpearance of an irresponsible troubling of the pool with no higher object than that of blackmail.&quot; And again: &quot;1. Italy has never forgiven France for forestalling her as the predominant Power in the Danube Basin; 2. She wishes to take the place of Austria-Hungary as the arbitrator of the Balkans, and 3. She asjjires to become the predominating Power in the Mediterranean.&quot;This description of Italy&apos;s feelings and ambitions still holds generally good. Indeed, at first sight there would seem to have been some intensification of the tendencies analysed in last year&apos;s memorandum, and Italy has appeared in many respects less uncertain than a year ago concerning the means to her ends. But for a time at least there appeared two signs of grace in Italy&apos;s attitude towards France and Yugoslavia the first tangible evidences, it may be said, of that hesitating and reluctant advance in the direction of international co-operation already observed by Sir R. Graham.Throughout 1930 Italy&apos;s relations with France and Yugoslavia had shown no improvement. Neighbours never love one another, and States may be maddening; but this particular group alternates heat with a polar distance. So distant were France and Italy that it required a British intermediary to carry messages between them for several months in an endeavour to get the two Governments to say that they would not embark upon a race in naval armaments which neither of them desired.As for Yugoslavia, the usual attempts have been made to induce Rome to talk with Belgrade in the hope that frank discussions might reveal the emptiness(ii) Lesser Ex-Enemy Powers.(iii) Italy.
of the quarrel.  After months of sterility there seemed at one time a faint hope that the two countries might find in the maintenance of the status quo in Albania the basis for some sort of understanding.   This at first sight sounds eminently reasonable, but the Albanian status quo conceals a multitude of old Italian sins. In fact, it consecrates Italy&apos;s most successful effort since the war in imperialistic diplomacy, whereby she has established a virtual protectorate over Albania. Thus, we find embedded in the status quo the right of Italy (under the first Treaty of Tirana) to military intervention in defence of the internal regime in Albania, and, what is almost as bad, Italy&apos;s privilege (extorted from the Ambassadors&apos; Conference in 1921) in virtue an unfitting term of which the conference Powers agree to support her claim to employment by the League for the protection   of   Albania&apos;s   independence   against   aggression,   whenever   the Council decides that such protection is needed.    Yugoslavia finds it hard to condone this state of affairs;  indeed, King Alexander recently informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Belgrade that his country would never recognise the decision of the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, and that all he wanted was a common guarantee, without diplomatic subterfuge, of Albanian territory.   The position is meanwhile rendered even more unsatisfactory by the subsidies given to Albanian emigres by Yugoslavia,  and by the many rumours of Yugoslav complicity in the attack on King Zog, rumours which, however, would seem unfounded in view of the fact that the death of the King would almost certainly lead to immediate chaos in Albania resulting in Italian intervention  the last thing Yugoslavia desires.  If any agreement should materialise, it would be indeed a notable advance not only on the part of Yugoslavia but also of Mussolini, who so far has refused to depart from the fundamental principle that if Yugoslavia wishes to be friends with Italy she must give up her friendship with France.  This announcement has, at any rate, the merit of candour, but it throws an uncomfortable light upon Italian mentality; a grosser example of the spirit and method of old Adam it would be difficult to imagine.   This pretension to treat relations as synonymous with misconduct continues to poison the various attempts at compromise made from time to time, such as the proposal to replace the present objectionable Franco-Yugoslav Treaty by a triple agreement between France, Italy and Yugoslavia.   The French have shown signs of reviving or at least of trying some artificial respiration upon this project, which the Italians have regarded as still-born.The truth is that Italy, perhaps justly, still insists upon treating Yugoslavia as a mere pawn of France, and Yugoslavia on her side has not the vitality to demonstrate that she is no such thing. Thus the vicious circle in this respect remains complete; Italy will not live on neighbourly terms with Yugoslavia so long as the latter is bound to France, Yugoslavia dares not emancipate herself from French control so long as she feels herself boycotted and threatened by Italy, and France and Italy cannot easily establish normal relations so long as the control of Yugoslavia is for each an indispensable requirement of national security.Of late Italy, like the rest of us, has been hard hit by the economic depression, and the strain is all the greater in her case because her reserve of strength is limited, and because the Fascist regime is based so largely on material prestige. To counteract the political effects of the depression Mussolini was in 1930 rather more vociferous and truculent than usual in his speeches. He conceived himself forced perhaps to keep the gallery quiet and, whether by necessity or nature, to overplay the role of protector of a defenceless people surrounded by envy, hatred and malice. Another, and somewhat ominous, method, which he has recently adopted to consolidate the regime, has been the introduction of measures destined to subject the whole youth of the country to military training and Fascist discipline before the joeriod of actual military service begins. To this spirit also presumably belong such manifestations as the banishment of foreign words and the. alien jury system.Two other events of last year have given special impetus to the trend of Italian policy the disarmament negotiations and the German elections. The long-drawn-out naval wrangle intensified Franco-Italian rivalry in 1930; parity, after a year&apos;s discussion, was transmogrified from a theoretical demand to a vital principle of Italian policy. Mussolini saw in France&apos;s resistance to this principle the acid test of her attitude towards Italian aspirations as a whole, and in the face of such &quot;evidence&quot; of danger, Italian public opinion sought counter-measures of defence rather than[5185]rj
means of appeasement. Italy has, for instance, brought in a system of military training between the ages of 55 and 8, so that it would be difficult, in French apprehension, to carry further a nation in arms, saving it should cry avanti at the breast. Incomprehensible as it may seem, Italian public opinion has been so worked up that the average Italian can be led to believe a heavy-weight France may attack a cruiser-weight but growing Italy in the near future. (A welter-weight Yugoslavia often thinks the same about Italy.) It was particularly unfortunate that in this moment of nervous irritation the German elections should have occurred. Italy hailed the Nazi success as foreshadowing the militarist renaissance of Germany, and inclined to explore the opportunity of this new force for Italian ends. As was explained in last year&apos;s memorandum, it has long been the hope of Italian foreign policy to establish some sort of contact with Germany and other ex-enemy Powers, which might have developed into an anti-French bloc. The German election shows, so argues the Italian &quot; realpolitiker,&quot; that treaty-revision is now the magic word with which to appeal to the German public. This is the cry that has contributed to sweep the Nazis over a hundred strong into the Reichstag, and that is bound to find its echo in Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. Though South Tyrol, for instance, makes treaty revision a most unsuitable &quot; release &quot; for a modern .ZEolus, Mussolini realises that future inconsistency must be risked for the sake of immediate gain. In a speech on the 27th October last, and in a Christmas inter-view published in a German Nationalist newspaper, he declared that Italy is in favour of treaty revision. By thus ranging herself definitely, if nebulously, on the side of the revisionaries, Italy has done much to consolidate the resentment of the defeated nations into a concrete policy of which she, a great Power, would be the leader and inspirer.It is not so much the revisionist policy of Italy, as the method, occasion and ulterior object of the step so abruptly taken, that I view with anxiety.It may be that we should begin to accustom our minds to the idea of revision as a long-range policy; it will indeed be found tentatively suggested in the conclusion of this memorandum. But that Italy of all countries should stimulate prematurely, and with a dubious and short-sighted aim, the hopes of those who envy France must be reckoned dangerous and retrograde.Italy&apos;s future policy is, as has been said above, now less uncertain, and it is worthy of examination. It seems probable that it will be threefold in form. First, then, it is likely that she will look northward. Germany is an opportunist; all is grist that comes to her mill, and she watched with dawning, and therefore slightly chilly, respect and interest the rise of post-war Italy. Owing to her present military weakness she feels herself in no good posture to press her aims, and would therefore be pleased to see an Italy under no such disability take the initiative in demanding revision. But in any such combination, &quot; il y a toujours un qui baise et un qui tend la joue,&quot; and we shall hear no resonant buss, for Germany, who distrusts the self-centred character of Italian policy, is unlikely to incline more than a proper cheek, unless France should push them into each other&apos;s arms. In no circumstances is she likely to make the first advances, for limber Italy has played her false in the past too often to justify flaxen trustfulness now. Partie and altar seem alike dubious. Germany still remembers the turncoat of 1914, and suspects that Italy would be an uneasy bedfellow; but she will dally with Italian advances so long as she is not too far engaged or compromised.For the moment, any such co-operation between Italy and Germany will take the form of reciprocal assistance in the Council of the League rather than of military understanding. Signs of this co-operation at Geneva were, indeed, apparent last year. Secondly, Italy has recently been trying to bind various small Powers into a group, of which the cement would be the common desire for revision, or at least sympathy with such a demand. At present it is difficult to judge what truth lies behind the rumours in circulation about the proposed pact; they are, however, of sufficient importance to create a suspicion that there is some flame behind the smoke. The bases on which Italy is working are the existing Italo-Turkish, Italo-Greek and Gra5co-Turkish treaties. These she wishes to combine in a tripartite pact, and it may be assumed that in working for such an agreement she has two objects in view one political, and the other military and economic. First she desires to strengthen her influence in South-Eastern Europe as against France by making of the pact the nucleus for a revisionist bloc; and secondly, she realises that, in the event of war with France, it would be vital to her that the Dardanelles and the .^aegean should be kept open for supplies from Russia.  The Greeks however are unlikely, at any rate so long
as M. Veniselos is in power, to be parties to any aggressive misuse of such a tri-partite agreement, although its conclusion may stimulate apprehensions in France and Yugoslavia.The third aspect of Italian policy which merits attention is the possibility of an Italo-Russian rapprochement. Here the position as regards Italo-German relations is reversed. It is rather Russia &quot; qui baise &quot; and-Italy &quot;qui tend la joue.&quot; Russian policy is of necessity to a large extent destructive, and wherever troubled waters exist she is the compleat angler. For this reason she is likely to seek improvement of her relations with one or other of the Western Powers, since she dislikes her present isolation, and hopes that such a move would enable her to carry on with greater ease a policy of embarrassment.Though the Fascist political system is in some ways poles apart from that of the Soviet, Italy is obviously the most suitable partner for Russia to choose; for there is in other respects a certain similarity between the methods of the two extreme systems. (The Nazis indeed have been trying to make the two ends meet in a rare farrago.) It has been said that &quot; a tous les pouvoirs, surtout a un pouvoir nouveau, il faut un peu de grandeur dans leurs ceuvres et sur leur drapeau.&quot; Both fascism and bolshevism are comparatively new forces, tending therefore to seek this &quot; grandeur,&quot; notably in effort to consolidate the country by harping constantly on the dangers that threaten it from without. There is thus a certain affinity to be observed between the methods of Mussolini and Stalin. Moreover, Italy and Russia incline naturally toward each other owing to the similarity in the aim of their foreign policy. Italy is discontented with the present territorial position, and is in a better position than Germany to gain their common ends. Italy, too, is seeking allies in her campaign for the revision of the Peace Treaties, and has long considered an attempt to enrol an essentially revisionary Russia as member of a troupe of quick-change artists. Let it be said again, however, that Italy does not want warfare for all such symptoms as the Hymn of the Dopolavoro, which is less the workers&apos; thanksgiving than &apos;&apos; the stuff to give the troops.&quot;As yet the whole situation is vague in the extreme, and it is therefore dangerous to indulge in prophecy, which has been defined as foretelling a morrow something like yesterday or going wrong. It is, however, probable that Italy will endeavour to improve Russo-Roumanian relations, not from altruistic motives but because she hopes that, were the attempt successful, Roumania would turn to her for support instead of to France as hitherto. The task will no doubt be difficult, but this stealing of allies and marches upon rivals is as familiar in the game of militarist politics played by old Adam as the organised barter between Italy and Soviet Russia is novel for industrial States.It is thus apparent that Italy is rapidly assuming, if indeed she has not already assumed, the role of leader in the revisionist group. It is also clear that she has chosen a line of policy which, if MussolinFs recent swerve in the direction of co-operation is not continued and intensified,.may easily lead Europe backward toAvard the position in 1914, when that ignis fatuus, the balance of power, landed us in the bog. Circumstances have, as we have seen, conspired to assist this retrograde movement and,, if the political evolution of Germany and Italy continues as at present, we can no longer assume that, the first step in the liquidation of the war having been satisfactorily completed, the second stage is necessarily going to be accomplished with equal success.(C.)-ONLOOKERS.Under this heading I would include not the whole of the rest of the world  for it would be true to say that the rest of the world looks on at Europe but only those States who, while their interests and position would entitle them to take an active part in the national rivalries of Europe, yet prefer, for their own reasons, to look on so long as circumstances permit or it serves their purpose to do so. Such onlookers fall into three classes: Soviet Russia. Greece, the United States and ourselves,(i) Soviet Russia.Russia is a hostile Power with which we wish to pursue friendly relations. It is a difficult task, and she goes out of her way to make it harder.   The remarks on Soviet Russia in the previous memorandum still hold good; and the past year has shown, if anything, an increase in that negative influence [5185] d 2
which was there noted as Russians sole contribution to the foreign politics of Europe. Actual military aggression has for the time being at any rate been rendered still more improbable by the internal difficulties, both political and economic, in which the governing clique in Moscow have involved themselves through the premature acceleration of the Five-Year Plan. These very difficulties, however, have caused an increase of hostility to the capitalist world, which the Soviet Government have deliberately encouraged in order to distract the attention of the Russian public from their failures.Countries where only the ruling element enjoys life must either be, or swear that their neighbours are, aggressive. Illustrations are too profuse for comfort. At the same time the Soviet Government, who appear genuinely hypnotised by their own propaganda into the belief that they are exposed to foreign attack at any moment, have endeavoured to forestall this attack, as well as to promote their other aims, by intensified diplomatic activity abroad, concentrating on the &apos;&apos; revisionist &apos;&apos; countries, the natural enemies of France, Poland, and their satellites. As stated in the section on Italy, the Soviet Government have made overtures, even proposing a military alliance, and, though Signor Mussolini and his Government have hitherto kept the Italo-Soviet entente on a strictly economic basis, they could apparently secure more for the asking, if they should decide, for reasons of their own, to embark upon a more aggressive policy. Similar overtures seem to have been made to the minor &quot;revisionist&quot; States, such as Hungary and Bulgaria; and every nerve has been strained to keep Germany and Turkey apart from the Western Powers.Soviet policy, in fact like the Communist creed- remains as fundamentally aggressive as ever, and though this aggressiveness is not likely, for the present at least, to take the form of military adventure, this is merely because the Soviet authorities consider that their ends may possibly be achieved with less risk by their present policy of propaganda, economic development and the utilisation of other discontented elements in Europe. At the same time Russian military development is being steadily pursued. The Soviet active army of 800,000 or 1,500,000 if G.P.U. troops and frontier and territorial militia be included is the largest of our time, and, in the eyes of its neighbours, is organised for offensive rather than defensive purposes. (5) The Russian is greater than the German difficulty in the way of disarmament. To realise this one must begin by putting oneself in the place of a border State convinced, and with some justifi-cation, that extensive military preparations lead to war whether labelled offensive or defensive, and that the next decade may witness definite old-fashioned Russian aggression (a) if all goes reasonably well with the Soviets internally, (b) if their nostrum fails to spread sufficiently by other methods. And to the minds of neighbours Soviet professions of disarmament carry no conviction.We need here pursue no further this matter of psychology, and, like a recently condemned Russian professor, we must &quot; obstinately keep biology out of politics.&quot; But, even from the more obtuse angle of this memorandum, there is a darker aspect of the feverish Russian search for insecurity, pursued with the same extravagant conviction as if an Irishman should refuse to walk the Cromwell Road. It is a primitive injectionable country, not yet irreligious but only anti-religious, being in that dangerous state where politics are religion though I suppose that most of us cannot preen ourselves on entire emergence, seeing that our economics are nearer to religion than to science. On the flank of Europe there is a crude block of 150 million people, increasing by at least %\ million a year, dragooned to the mass production of hate, trained to perpetual &quot; shadow-boxing.&quot; Into these dim minds has been dinned, with no middle-register of rudeness, that they live in a world of tooth and claw ever ready to spring upon the Soviet purities. Soon no Russian will have heard anything else. He believes in ogres, magic formulae, si vis pacem para helium, and the whole outfit of wicked-fairy stories. The consequence of perpetually howling wolf is not indifference among neighbours, but lycanthropy at home. On such a mentality pacific professions would be wasted, even if they ever got there : the Soviets never doubt what Europe says, they just don&apos;t believe a word of it. The curve of Russian military expenditure has accordingly risen higher and more sharply than that of any other country. Her military budget has grown threefold since 1924-5 alone. The Osoaviakhim a league for stimulating the martial spirit of the people, and encouraging every kind of preparation, particularly chemical and aerial, for  ^&apos;)E.g., the air force, also the largest of our time, consists mainly of long-distance bombers and observers, not of defensive chaser machines.
war is increasing its membership from 4 to 12 millions. The number of students at the Military Technical Academy has increased two and a half times during the last year. As in the case of Germany &quot; the use of poison gas is certainly intended &quot;; at least its use in all forms is actively studied and prepared.Thus, in the eyes of old Adam, a reservoir of his own spirit is filling, and in the &quot; emphasis of order at the price of freedom &quot; to be euphemistic there is little chance of recalcitrance. To his mind the question is one of efficiency, and to that there is some contribution from across the German border, for to old Adam this weight of potential ill-will and docile pugnacity is a factor to be reckoned with. This is already the case all over Europe in varying degrees of acuity and anticipation, particularly, perhaps, in Poland, Germany and Italy. In the retail of life bad-tempered people usually get their own way, and this is apt to hold good of the wholesale of politics. The fostering of nerves and temper in Russia must be plain to all but the wilfully blind, of whom, by tradition and heredity, we have long been prolific in international politics. All that can be said in the extenuation of it is that it feeds on the constant international outcry against Russia. This in turn no doubt feeds on such &quot; ruthlessness &quot; (the Russian spirit in peace has conceptions mighty like the German spirit in war) as the treatment of men as tool-fodder; but it can only be deplored from the point of view of diplomacy, which should at least be an endeavour to take a long view. Russia somehow seems to bring out the worst of everyone, particularly Russians. It must be said, in conclusion, that one of the difficulties of the Russian question  and a large question it is remains that everywhere it tends to get at once into party politics,(6) clouding or colouring a comprehensive outlook; for the purely internal politics of Russia, or any other country, &quot; have nothing to do with the case,&apos;&apos; and furnish no reason why Russian history should be written as if it were a dispute about taste.Two minor onlookers, Lithuania and Finland, perhaps deserve mention here  Lithuania, for the persistence displayed during the past year in pursuing the policy of isolation and cynical readiness to sell herself to the highest bidder, which she has adopted ever since she lost Vilna; and Finland, because the &quot; Lappo Movement&quot; threatens to throw the country back into a crude nationalism of an almost &quot; Nazi &quot; type.(ii) Greece.Although nowadays he acts on a much reduced stage, M. Veniselos&apos; performance is worthy of a passing and very honourable mention. In his small sphere he is working at the big policy of co-operation and appeasement, and his successes do him and his country credit. He has already achieved two &quot; impossi-biliti.es &quot; a complete detente and entente with Turkey, and with Italy a working agreement which does not alarm any of Greece&apos;s neighbours, and which has not drawn Greece into Italy&apos;s orbit. He is not yet satisfied nor should he be  until he has achieved yet another detente and entente with Bulgaria without alienating Yugoslavia, and with Albania without alienating Italy. When these two further &quot; impossibilities &quot; are accomplished the ground will be prepared for the construction the ultimate object of all his efforts of the edifice of Balkan federation. In admiring M. Veniselos&apos; courage and zeal, however, one cannot help knowing that in its essence the chef d&apos;ceuvre he is striving for is one which no single man can accomplish alone, and one begins to wonder where his necessary collaborators are to be found. Will they be forthcoming among the present race of Balkan politicians?   The answer is more than doubtful.One is reminded, in contemplating this fine effort, of another man for whom a similar task has been waiting for the last ten years, and who failed, not from trying, but from mistaking bluster and fine words for broad vision and hard work.   I mean M. Benes and the problem of the Danube States.(iii) United States.To complete this survey the present position of the United States must be summarised, and in this connexion it is necessary to differentiate between (1) Anglo-American relations as they stand to-day, and (2) the attitude of the United States towards Europe and the problems of the Old World.As regards the relations between the United States and this country, a&apos;very striking improvement has occurred during the last two years, attributable in part to the determination of both countries to rid themselves, in co-operation with
Japan, of the growing irritant of naval competition. It is no exaggeration to say-that Anglo-American relations have probably never before been on a sounder basis than they are at the present time.While, so far as Anglo-American relations are concerned, we may look forward with reasoned optimism to the future, it would be idle to suggest that there has been - despite spasms of common sense any change in the pained and superior convexity of America. There may be, and is, a growing-desire on the part of the &quot; Peace&quot; groups in the United States for more positive and less timorous co-operation; with other nations in the settlement of international disputes by pacific means; the severe economic depression after the bursting of the inflation bubble in 1929 has added to the number of American financial and commercial leaders who suspect that all is not right with the long-continued policy of isolation. But the politician is still firmly attached to the old parrot-cries and catchwords. Notwithstanding American participation in the Kellogg Pact, and although the maintenance of peace is the corner-stone and commonplace of United States foreign policy (since only by the maintenance of peace can the growing dependence of the United States on her foreign trade be safeguarded), there is little likelihood of the present United States Administration being willing to pay any insurance premiums. We shall doubtless continue to hear much about idealism from across the Atlantic, and to be furnished with many facile but impractical recipes for expediting the arrival of the millennium; but we must recognise that there can be no active American participation in European political problems in the near future. There will be no teething of the Kellogg Pact, or, indeed, any activity which by any stretch of the imagination could be described as the assumption of an obligation or a responsibility. This is a natural and unfortunate consequence of the United States having always been more conservative than England. It follows from this that satisfaction at recent qualified support in our endeavours to solve the Franco-Italian impasse must not blind us to the inescapable fact that there can be no United States interven-tion against expansionist aims on the part of Germany, Italy, or any other continental nation. It may not be entirely-irrelevant to note here that Mr. Hoover and Mr. Legge have recently expressed a desire to &quot; stage a fade-out &quot; in regard to the world wheat market, and then to resist behind tariff walls the depressing influence of world surplus.For our present purposes it would be a waste of Central European time to analyse in detail why the great matriarchy is not yet ready to see that to our small concerns also may be applied the maxim : &quot; So long as gravitation acts, no disturbance can be confined to any area less than the whole of space. &quot;(7) Our friends are still in the main nicely unconscious that facts become obsolete though incontestable, like the width of the Atlantic. We, however, cannot afford their warm habit of pulling the wool over their own eyes. The real reason why there are no teeth in the Kellogg Pact is not, as Americans pretend, because it is morally better so, but because they are afraid that even false teeth are a commit-ment. It is easier to disbelieve in &quot;anything tougher than suet.&quot; In the American cosmos Providence lets the theatre and we put on the play; but the United States still want none of the risks or worries of management. Moreover, they may well have their hands and minds full at home. If they be faced with any long-term crisis, there must be some question-mark against the future of this lawless and heterogeneous agglomeration. It is, indeed, the most interesting specimen of the general problem just dawning on man, whether, having come through his night, he will survive the perils of his day. Meanwhile there are signs in plenty that, absorbed in development, the United States have, as was said of them long ago, &quot; talked liberty so long they had forgotten the necessity of government.&quot; The United States are in fact a dry land submerged by seagreen corruptibles. The point that concerns us is that, while they are weathering their own storms and steadying from the coming country to the going(c) A phenomenon distinguishing the 20th century from its predecessors is the extent to which internal and external politics have become interlocked. The advantages of this increasing interest in the latter have of course to be bought, and sometimes dearly. For examples, among scores, our two most recent difficulties the Franco-Italian naval irreconcilabilities and the proposed Austro-German customs union have been greatly complicated, even caused in part, by internal politics, which in the existing state of the continent are largely either incoherent or repressive, sometimes both. It is worth wondering whether there can be &quot;security&quot; in Europe until the corruption of her motley party spirits be overhauled.(r)&quot; We expect an increase in banditry on account of the depression in the world silk market.&quot;   Extract from a letter received, while writing, from Kwantung.
concern, the future of the world will largely be settled without them. The misfortune needs no emphasis. Of the Kellogg Pact then we must make the most, but not too much, lest they lie back on imaginary laurels, or think themselves out of the wood because they never saw it for lumber. These are bleak facts, but, since there is a ray in the cloud, and since what I wrote upon it in last year&apos;s memorandum is a fact not yet obsolete, I will venture to repeat myself :  &quot; So seemingly negative a result may not, however, be entirely useless to us. If the United States can be persuaded, or, rather, can persuade themselves and to many it will be collar-work that, of all the European nations we alone are attempting to exert a sane and salutary influence towards the reduction of international friction and the maintenance of peace, Anglo-American relations should be the gainers. In a word, without any treaty or alliance, the United States could, through this country, exert an indirect but useful influence upon the European situation. This is a conceivable, if not a probable, eventuality. Franco-American relations have been much impaired, by excessive intercourse, among other things, and America&apos;s view of Germany is still affected by the war. Although so many Americans still look up to us with dislike, we may yet shine like a good deed in a naughty world, made up, in their xenophobe and heterogeneous eyes, of invalids with criminal propensities. Europe, after all, as shown in this memorandum, does sometimes go out of her way to look the part.&quot;It must be added that last year I also wrote that the American bonnet is haunted not only by the isolationist bee, but by the -Nationalist hornet, and that the old Adam is stronger in the New World than he is in this country. The last part of the sentence remains true, but the agreement of 1930 has resulted in a satisfac-tory dwindling of the hornet&apos;s drone.(iv)   Great Britain.We also may rank ourselves among the onlookers. For that very reason, and in healthy revulsion against the tendency to return to the group system, the Turkish Ambassador informed me recently, on behalf of his Government, that Turkey had decided to throAV her lot into the friendliest and closest collaboration with this country. If this declaration stood alone, one might have been tempted to mild cynicism lest it came forth from feigned lips. But, as a matter of fact, there is a good deal of this kind of feeling, current or latent, and to it we owe les beaux restes of our influence. I do not intend in this paper to outline a summary of British policy. That was contained in the paper produced for the Imperial Conference.   But I should like to make two points.One is that British influence is still sought and desired by statesmen in Europe and in America who are anxious about the next ten years. It is a commonplace that, both in economics and politics, the world is lacking in leadership and direction. M. Briand gave such a lead at the Assembly in 1929, and we know that the President of the United States is hoping for such a lead from us now in the matter of disarmament. What can be done by disinterested mediation has been shown by the results of the Secretary of State&apos;s visit to Paris and Rome. But I would venture to repeat what I emphasised last year, that influence is still proportional to weight, whether that weight be military, financial or moral. In regard to the first and third, it is at least possible that France would not have acted as she has done in the naval agreement had she attached more substance to our goodwill. In regard to the second, several of our leading financiers have informed me that they have had analogous experience at continental meetings. We must be frank with ourselves and acknowledge that our influence has been impaired by the state of our own health, and yet more by alarming, even alarmist, rumours and bulletins. If anyone doubts this he may spend a week almost any-where in Europe and keep his ears open; he will not wait long for the assumption that we are going downhill. Now and again some quite good friend of ours, like M. Andre Siegfried, will come into the open and say it with sufficient chapter and verse to convince a number of intelligent readers. For this the standards of old Adam are not alone to blame. We must indeed expect the state of our resources to be constantly appraised abroad, and such appraisement, if even approximately correct, must show that either we are ahead of, or Europe is behind, our times. For her own sake she has need of much downward parity. And, since in the course of this memorandum it has been necessary to offer much criticism of foreign spirit and mentality, it is meet also to draw attention to
3.-ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE EUROPEAN SITUATION,Before we endeavour to arrive at any final estimate of the European situation as outlined in the foregoing paragraphs, one point should be strongly emphasised. It is nowadays impossible to divorce politics from economics, and in this section an attempt will therefore be made to examine the various activities of the old Adam observable in the economic sphere, where they are no less deleterious though perhaps less obvious.We have noted the prevalence in the political domain of that complex of prejudices, ambitions and fears which is impeding the progress of the principles enshrined in the Covenant of the League and the Kellogg Pact. In turning our attention to the domain of economics we might well be tempted to hope that here at least the spirit of old Adam would find no scope for his obstructive and destructive activities. The whole process of economics, especially in its modern development, is essentially cosmopolitan in outlook and international in method; it often ignores geographical frontiers, and its best achievements are based on world-wide co-operation rather than on competition. In theoiy this is irrefutable. Nor can it be denied that economic forces are capable of contributing largely to the affirmation of political stability and the furtherance of political wisdom. But, unfortunately, in practice it is found that these consequences only ensue when the economic forces of the world are working smoothly without friction and withouttwo failings of our own from of old. One is a disinclination to face facts, of which our commitments under the Covenant and Locarno are examples; the other is the desire to have it both ways our own form of dualism  as illustrated by the comfortable exertion of &apos;&apos; influence.&quot; But it just does not happen that way, and these irritating foibles have led to the other less founded, but as already shown traditionally and instinctively bandied, charges such as &apos;&apos; hypocrisy.&apos;&apos;My second point is that we ought again and again to ask ourselves whether we need to have a &quot; concrete foreign policy.&quot; For the past year I have been endeavouring to establish closer relations between the Foreign Office and the City, so that such forces as this country possesses may at least not be counteracting in watertight ignorance of each other. At a gathering of bankers which, in this aim, I attended last autumn we were trying to promote an international as opposed to a purely French loan for Yugoslavia the incidental reproach cropped up that they were often handicapped in willingness to co-operate by the absence of &quot; a concrete foreign policy &quot; on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Governments  in the successive plural as compared with those of foreign Governments.The answer is, in part and immediately, easy. His Majesty&apos;s Government has repeatedly declared that the keystone of its foreign policy is the League, and the principles, the undertakings, for which it stands. But there is another answer. What foreign Governments ultimately, perhaps even unconsciously, mean by a &quot;concrete &quot; foreign policy pans out at something damnably like the old group system, which is, indeed, already again in some force. We have been consistently opposed to such a system, and, even if we were not, there is no group that we approve sufficiently to join. We are engaged again in assisting rash drivers to turn corners. But the profession of A.A. representatives at the crossroads is not enough for &quot; the troubles of our proud and angry dust.&quot; We did that before the war and were called insular for our pains, as if continental nations were international. Nor, seeing the resurrection of old Adam, with chapter and verse of the Acts of his Apostles, is the League alone enough. The suggestions attempted at the end of this review, unprompted by the bankers&apos; reproach, may perhaps at least provoke the timely consideration and formulation of others to ease and complement our policy of the League. For this country is still pivotal. On her &quot; internationalism &quot; the event turns. Whether &quot; concrete &quot; forethought is now called for, as opposed to our straightforward pre-war opportunism, is a matter for opinion to which this review may contribute. I believe the conclusion must be that, in spite of the living dualism of the League plus, or rather minus, old Adam, Europe is drifting, and we shall not wish to drift with her. At least we have need to ask, and not to beg, a fundamental question; and it were well to ask and answer soon for, even if we escape an international economic crisis in 1931, we are very possibly set for a considerable political crisis in 1932.
obstruction. The world and mankind being what they are, these Utopian con-ditions rarely occur. Above all they do not exist at the present time. For generations the economic processes of the world have not been impeded by greater or more numerous obtsacles. Everywhere the friction thereby generated is intense, and this friction shows no sign of diminishing. Such circumstances, far from being inimical to the old Adam, afford him unexpected opportunities for activity and mischief.But this is not all. We must not think that the economic struggle itself is merely a kind of growing pain which, though disagreeable to the body politic, will leave no unpleasant after-effects. It would be a mistake to under-estimate the effects of economic war as compared with military war merely because its processes are gradual and insidious instead of spectacular and catastrophic. Moreover, economic war is deadly because it is often the irritant productive of the political inflammation that may possibly culminate in military war. Most adamite wars have had economic origins, and the modern development of unbridled industrialisation, especially since the Great War, might well in future increase rather than decrease the strength of the economic factor as a cause of political antagonism between nations. As in the past these antagonisms may well lead to disaster, although nowadays, no doubt, the weapons of economic war are sufficiently powerful to make resort to cruder expressions unnecessary except as a last resort.No one, I think, will deny that the Great War gave an enormous and artificial impetus to industrialisation; in consequence the world is now threatened with over-production or, let us say, with the disorganisation due to unbalanced and unregulated production. To this fact may be attributed in large measure the economic strain and pressure now apparent in most parts of the globe. But my business is not so much with diagnosis as with the fact that, whatever the causes may be, a world-wide economic struggle of great intensity is developing before our eyes.On the one hand, Governments and nations, when they realise the strength of the economic forces working in spheres within their control, can rarely resist the temptation of using them in order (1) to help them to obtain an easier victory in their political fights, and (2) to supplement and reinforce their purely military measures of defence and offence. Thus the economic struggle grows increasingly nationalistic, and the more closely it is identified with the political rivalries between nations, the more embittered are those rivalries likely to become. On the other hand, these warring economic forces themselves tend to drive Governments, perhaps unconsciously but no less effectively, to mould their politics in con-formity with the dictates of the economic struggle, which they dimly apprehend but cannot control. Once the strength and extent of these inter-actions are realised, I think it becomes evident that, if we prescribe purely political remedies for the present-day problem of Europe, we run the risk of merely fumbling with superficial symptoms instead of attacking the root causes.It must not be forgotten, moreover, that in terms of the adamite mind and vocabulary war has come to-day to depend more and more on the economic factor, which, in the Middle Ages, can only be said to have come into question in isolated cases. It was not until the French wars of 1790 to 1815 that the industrial revolution had really begun, and the economic power of Great Britain was sufficiently strong to prevent Napoleon from making a success of his scheme for what may be called the &quot; federalisation of Europe.&quot; The climax was reached in the Great&quot;War, when perhaps the outstanding factor was economic, manifested on the side of the Allies by the blockade of Germany and on the side of the Central Powers by the submarine campaign.It may be asked in what consists the economic armoury available to the modern State. Apart from the traditional weapons of tariffs, bounties (both direct and indirect), and systems of licences and prohibitions, the industrialisa-tion of the present epoch has armed Governments with&apos; new and hitherto undreamed of engines of economic warfare. The chief of these is rationalisation, in which is included the cartel system. This new development is none the less dangerous because it appears at first sight to involve international co-operation. In reality, however, it lends itself so readily to abuse that its essential peaceful-ness is overlaid with a certain sinister perversion. Rationalisation can be turned into a most effective political weapon. It may assume either an intensely nationalist complexion, may be governed and controlled by State activity deliberately serving political ambitions, or it may serve purely economic needs[5185]e
and have no conscious connexion with the national policy. Germany and America are good examples of these opposite types. But whether from conscious political aim or not, these movements always produce a political effect, both in the foreign relations of States as well as in their internal affairs.It has been pointed out in a recent memorandum by Sir Victor Wellesley that, &apos;&apos; as an example of the possibilities of the cartel system, the late Hugo Stinnes may be quoted. He is said to have succeeded in controlling one-fifth of the entire production of Germany, and to have been interested in over 1,300 undertakings. Had he lived it is not improbable that he would have effected an amalgamation with the Rathenau group, thereby extending his control over a still larger proportion of the German productive machine. Small wonder that he so steadfastly maintained &apos; it is economics, not politics, that matter.&apos; Rathenau.held similar opinions, and declared that industry and commerce could no longer be regarded as a private affair, but must be co-ordinated in a great trust working under a State charter and focussing all the resources of science and production. It is true, however, that, after the stabilisation of German currency, the huge mergers brought into existence by the financial magnates of the inflation period gradually fell apart. Nevertheless the dominant feature of German development to-day is the idea of large-scale and more solid industrial combines, as, for instance, the &apos;I.G.F.&apos; and &apos; Stahlverein,&apos; and the very significant fusion of those two old rivals, the North-German Lloyd and the Hamburg-America Line. The real assets of any one of these mergers might well exceed those of the whole Stinnes group. The Stinnes combine was a rank growth of inflation, and died with the dropping of the mark; but, if it is possible for such power to be concen-trated in a single individual, it does not require much imagination to picture the entire economic activities of a nation focussed in a few hands under the supreme direction and control of the State. &apos; Three hundred men, all acquainted with each other,&apos; wrote Rathenau in 1909, &apos; control the economic destiny of the Continent.&apos; In Russia we have already in the most complete form the single and absolute State control of all national activities, though we cannot yet speak of rationalisation in that country in the modern sense.&quot;The chief political consideration to bear in mind in all this is that the more perfect the process of integration becomes, the more nearly it approaches the condition of a State trading as a single organism, and the more nearly it approaches that condition the more it lends itself as an instrument of policy to the furtherance of political ends. Under the pressure of world competition this tendency is increasing. In fact, the most ominous feature of the situation is the danger of these economic forces becoming harnessed to a narrow and militant nationalism instead of the peaceful internationalism, to which they are more naturally inclined. The tendency at present is toward the formation of barely disguised monopolies, supported by subsidies and protected by embargoes and tariffs. By such control of industry, commerce and finance, a State is in a position to wage economic warfare of the most bitter type, and, being in this position, may be tempted toward an imperialistic policy. In that case, however, the imperialism will be financial rather than political imperialism, of the type which shelters behind the white-washed word &quot;non-intervention,&quot; defined by Talleyrand as &quot; mot metaphysique et politique qui signifie a peu pres la meme chose qu&apos;intervention.&quot; A notable example of this brand of &quot; non-intervention &quot; is to be seen to-day in America&apos;s tutelage of Cuba and Nicaragua.I hope that in this brief analysis I have managed to indicate what I have in mind in regard to the strength of the economic forces operating in Europe, and the danger of their consequences when identified with national policies. It would be hard to point to a Great Power on the Continent, in this our perplexed generation, where the danger may not arise; and, whenever such methods are practised in the regulation of foreign affairs, it gives rise to an uneasy suspicion that the principles of the League and all that they stand for may be stultified, if not in the letter at least in the spirit. The framers of the Kellogg Pact were only thinking of military war when they called upon the nations of the world to repudiate war as an instrument of national policy. But it is no less anti-social for a nation to use economic war as an instrument of national policy, and so long as it may thus be used the peace of the world can never be established on a firm basis.If we look round the world to-day we, see everywhere countries busily perfecting their economic machines for the great struggle for existence that they see looming ahead.   In present circumstances we can scarcely complain that they
should thus seek to prepare themselves; but it is worth recalling that this attitude bears a remarkable resemblance to the situation in 1914, when the dangerous half-truth of preparing war if you desire peace was never out of the mouths of the statesmen of Europe. So long as this frame of mind persists, so long will Europe, and America too, be threatened with war, no less fatal to the peaceful evolution of Europe because it is economic and not military.Europe is strewn with examples. Russia is the most glaring and the most notorious; but the efforts of France, Italy, and such agrarian countries as Hungary and Poland (to take some typical cases), to industrialise themselves, are all equally the result of political and military promptings. In fact, it may be said that such promptings are impelling more or less every Government in Europe to-day to mobilise &quot; on Government service &quot; the economic potentialities of the country. When Germany dreams of another imperialism, what is in her mind is not necessarily military glory; the wiser of her leaders are thinking in terms of economic imperialism. Germany, deprived by the Peace Treaty of her military weapons, is now busy perfecting her economic arm, so that it may serve her, when the moment comes, as a spearhead of attack in the slow campaign for the peaceful domination of Europe. The French are not altogether wrong in seeing in the proposed Austro-German Customs Union the first move in a new economic hegemony. When France clings to her armaments she is perhaps not thinking only of German militarism; she may also be hoping by this means indirectly to counter-balance the economic predominance of Germany. If Germany is to dominate Europe economically, France will see to it that she herself at any rate continues to dominate the Continent militarily. Such economic argument is no less forceful for not being openly used. In such unavowed ways do economics inpinge on politics. We may observe also what political possibilities lie hidden in Germany&apos;s future economic relationship with Russia, if a time should come for German experience and German efficiency to take part in the running of that vast economic machine which the Bolsheviks are laboriously building up. That, when and if it happens, will be the supreme achievement of the old diplomacy in its cruellest and most ruthless form. The achievement will, moreover, be no less deplorable in that it might be considered in some sort inevitable. Since the days of Peter the Great, Russia has been dependent on Germany for the brains needed to direct and control, and there is insufficient reason anyhow as yet to suppose that the Russia of to-day is any more fundamentally capable of managing her own affairs without assistance.Of all the Great Powers of the world France, despite her recent progress in industrialisation, is still the least susceptible to the inter-play between economic and politics. We sometimes deem her self-centred and narrow,(s) when what we really resent is the fact that she is more materially self-supporting and self-sufficient than most great modern States. This independence enables her to practice pure politics for their own sake, while other Governments have continually to reconcile the divergent claims of national ambitions and economic forces. This gives to her political objectives an uncompromising sharpness and intensity, which is impossible to most other nations. But this self-sufficiency is by no means always a source of strength. It debars the French people from appreciating clearly the world problems of to-day. The combination of detach-ment and uncomfortable proximity to the rest of this modern world is sometimes a source of weakness in their politics. Perhaps this discomfort is at the bottom of France&apos;s continual cry for security, notwithstanding her present military and political predominance.So far we have dealt only with the case where Governments, seeing the potentiality of modern economic forces, use them for their own political and military purposes. There remains still the other form of reaction between politics and economics, where the economic forces dictate the direction of political objectives.   How far is this the case in the world to-day? -In the political section of this memorandum I have shown how the present economic depression warped last year the political development of practically(s) There is still too much xenophobia in England directed, mainly and unwisely enough, at the United States and France. For example, after the German performance at the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission I tried to get into our press some criticism of the German attitude, with an eye to preventing grievances from being all on one side in the future. But these salutary tactics proved quite unworkable; the answer was that the British public had been taught too long by British statesmen to regard France as the nigger in the woodpile. The reader may well rub his eyes.
every European country, (3) and how the international nervousness of 1930 could be traced to the tension of &quot;hard times,&quot; and the vague semi-Kruschen feeling that it is up to politicians to relieve economic strain by a forward policy. (A forward policy, of course, usually covers a multitude of sins and a few press millionaires.) But apart from this, let ^ us hope passing and reducible, phenomenon there are also more permanent elements in Europe to-day which are forcing politics along well-denned paths. Competition for raw materials on the one hand, and new markets on the other, is growing keener, while the juxtaposition of congested populations and under-peopled territories is a constant source of friction and of strain. Thus the inability of France and Italy to live on friendly terms in the political sphere is surely in large measure due to the biological fact that France, with a stationary population, is unable to develop her own territories without foreign labour, whereas her neighbour, Italy, with an increasing population, must be ever seeking new outlets for her children, of whom wisdom is not always justified. This impels the latter to roll the concupiscent eye, which keeps her retentive neighbour guessing. What is the good, the economic pessimist ma]^ say, of trying politically to reconcile France and Italy on desert frontiers and ships and sealing wax, so long as these fundamental economic antagonisms remain unsolved?Germany offers another example of a country dirigible by economic forces to a policy of expansion. Her highly developed industrial system seems to require sources of raw material, while her growing population- how far it will grow, however, is a question demands industrial outlets for those talents of perseverance and efficiency which distinguish it. When, therefore, we consider Germany&apos;s itch to re-establish her world position, it would now be a mistake to think that the sole impetus behind this policy is that of revenge, of wounded pride, or the love of military domination. The impulse is largely an economic one, which no German Government could resist if it would. Thus, to give but one instance, it will probably be the economic factor rather than political strategy which in the long run will decide Germany&apos;s attitude towards the &quot; Anschluss.&quot; What better proof of this can I give than the present attempt at an Austro-German Customs Union ? If we look at this move from the political angle, we see it, as I have already pointed out, as the utilisation of economic forces to a definite political end. If we now look at it from the economic angle, we see it as the impact of economic forces on national policy. Both pictures are true and both show the tremendous force of the reactions to-day between economics and politics.There is yet another field where economics may soon be dictating the policy of Governments. The world-wide depression of agriculture we may consider the modern history of wool and wheat, meat, coffee and cotton is encouraging a new defensive grouping in Eiu-ope of the agrarian countries and those that have failed to industrialise themselves. It is too soon to say whether this &quot; huddling &quot; will work in favour of international co-operation, or only produce another line of cleavage confusing the already existing political affinities. It is, however, a movement capable of political repercussions and to be watched.It will no doubt be argued that the danger of the national mobilisation of economic forces for political ends and its counterpart the distorting of political ends by economic needs ought to be met at once by international measures of economic disarmament, and by the creation of machinery for ensuring economic co-operation. This is true; but truth and fact sometimes swear at each other. For four years Geneva has been working on the lines laid down by the Economic Conference of 1927 to achieve at least a first step in economic disarmament and to awaken some slight demand for the outlawry of economic war. M. Colijn, who presided over these labours, has given an account of their history and their failure. As stated above, it is not cheerful reading. It shows that material results and future prospects are alike jejune. It would appear that other means will haAre to be sought for solving the problem. Let us hope that the thorough fright that this latest clash between economics and politics has produced may act as a whip to sting the jibbing nations of Europe into another, and this time more successful, attempt at laying aside their economic harness.(9) An exception might be claimed in the tacit agreement of Italy, under financial stress, to avoid mention of her claim for naval parity with France. But, equally, France was tempted to presume too far on her rivahs poverty and drive Italians, in Mussolini&apos;s phrase, &quot; to eat grass hi order to build ships.&quot;
Till then, man must, &quot;as at present advised,&quot; face the possibility of inter-national struggles developing, either through over-industrialisation, or the unequal control of raw materials, or the maldistribution of populations, to mention only the most obvious danger spots of his habitat. Ways may be found to prevent these struggles; in fact, they must be found, if the ideals of co-operation and disarmament are not to become simply political catchwords, signifying nothing of substance in this materialistic and illusory world. One thing only is certain : It will not be done by applying political cataplasms to economic complaints.4. INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION.The &apos;&apos; League of Nations &apos;&apos; if it is permissible for an observer and not an. attendant to offer any observations at all is an expression used freely and loosely by people who have not always time to think what they mean by it. This, after all, is the rule and not the exception in our habits. To some it connotes in a vague way a bureaucratic organisation, stalled in a one-horse town, encroaching on the legitimate and somewhat mysterious domain of every national Foreign Office, and thereby, in fact, a nuisance or a blessing, according to what is thought, equally vaguely, about Foreign Offices. To others it is a supernational, if not a supernatural, force of which the possibilities are as illimitable as the concept is misty. Actually, it is a quite reasonable attempt to import some kind of coherence into the muddled pattern formed of the different national policies, and a little humanity into inter-governmental dealings. Sometimes the Council or the Assembly is able to conjure up some solid exhibit, which is hailed with delight by the League enthusiasts. At other times nothing seems to come out of the hat, and then there are apt to be doubts whether the League can or will succeed in fulfilling its destiny.But lack of achievement may be due to either- one of two causes : lack of wrongs or failure to right them. There have been stagnant years at Geneva  reaction after too great an effort such as certainly followed the Geneva Protocol of 1924. Relaxation was said&apos; doubtless with some truth to be good for the organism; but that convalescence should have been complete some years ago. Things seem to have been going rather less well lately, and what has the League been doing to put &quot; things &apos;&apos; right ?There is no use in attempting to deny that, during the twelvemonth elapsed between the 1929 and 1930 Assemblies, the League had a lean period. The &quot;League &quot; itself, i.e., the delegates who attend the Assembly, were the first,- in. September last, to confess the fact.That, after all, is one of the advantages of Geneva : the participants do get a pooling of impressions, and the fact that the tone of the last Assembly was anxious shows at least I venture to think that Geneva mirrors pretty well the general state of Europe. If Geneva resounded always to speeches of optimism, it would be as useless as some people would like to believe that it is. On the whole, delegates show a commendable desire to look facts in the face. That is the first requisite for the remedy of uneasy situations, and ordinary humane intercourse between repre-sentatives of the various Governments may sometimes find a way out. In any case the &quot; League of Nations &quot; and now we get to the point-is in essence only the sum of the individual Governments that constitute it. If the Governments are in reasonable mood, the &quot; League &quot; can do something. If not, it cannot. It might be said, then, by objection, that the &quot; League &quot; is nothing, and that it has done and can do nothing to organise and direct the individual States. The first, and most obvious, answer to this objection is disappointing, if not shocking, to the idealists. It is simply that, if Monsieur A. has Fferr B. and Signor C. to dinner even a bad dinner several times a year, the tone of the diplomatic correspondence between those three statesmen (to say nothing of their conversation) undergoes a change. Before the war this curious and general trait was never properly exploited., The further reply whether those who have not attended meetings at Geneva will believe it or not is that some sort of corporate feeling does grow up at Geneva. There is a considerable degree of continuity in the membership of the Council and the Assembly. Quite above and apart from the several national prejudices and antipathies, there is a feeling common to each Council member that he is one of a body of men who have tackled problems together in the past, some-times with success and sometimes with failure. Even on the instinctive level any [5185] f
aocorporate body of men, if they have been abused and ridiculed by the press for failures and evasions in the past, will be keen to score a success. Moreover- and this is a matter of the first importance the Council have built up a regular &quot;technique&quot; for dealing with difficulties. Now technique is never impressive, and if adjournment seems to the casual observer to play an unduly important role in their procedure, it is not necessarily a contemptible or ineffective weapon. Some problems of quite respectable gravity are capable of being smothered altogether by &quot;technique,&quot; and it is not certain that some explosions of the past might not have been damped down by these means.The moral of all this if moral there is is that a &quot; bad year &quot; from the point of view of the League does not necessarily mean that the League is failing in its function. If all circumstances conspire to make things uneasy in Europe, the League cannot by a wave of the wand put them right. The League collects and concentrates opinion in the various States. If it did not reflect fairly faithfully that opinion, it would be too far out of touch with life to be able to do any real good. It can sometimes give a bold lead, but that is a risky thing to do. It can sometimes forge ahead of world opinion-as in 1924 and do great good to the world and no little harm to itself. These sudden impulses fail of their immediate realisation, of course, and the League suffers discredit for the failure. But their indirect results are greater than is usually realised. Take the Protocol, count up the number of its provisions which were regarded as impracticable, and therefore justifying its rejection, and it will be seen that in the intervening six years there are very few of them that have not been insinuated into the body of international law or at least been accepted in principle by the majority of Governments. This might have happened without the Protocol, but it is extremely doubtful, and it is certain that the process would not have been so rapid.Admittedly, however, during the past year the League has achieved nothing heroic, and even its more practical efforts have been generally nipped in the bud. The Assembly of 1929 dispersed in a noticeable state of exaltation. It had opened with mutual felicitations on The Hague settlement, rendering possible the completion of the evacuation of the Rhineland. That seemed to close the first and most depressing chapter of after-war history. The Pact of Paris had come into force. The prospects of the resumption of negotia-tions on naval armaments gave hope that the League might be able to take up again the difficult but imperative task of disarmament. Finally, the delegation of the United Kingdom Government showed that they were determined on a forward League policy, and in almost every sphere of the League&apos;s activity they submitted proposals for action. It would be foolish to pretend that all these high hopes were realised. At the risk of being wearisome, it may be worth while enumerating the principal matters with which the 1929 Assembly hoped to make progress, and noting to what extent these hopes were or were not realised.The Protocol for the accession of the United States to the Statute of the Permanent Court, and the Protocol for the Revision of the Statute, are not yet in force. The accession of the United States seems almost as remote as ever. Something was expected of the First Conference on Codification of International Law, which met in March last. Practically nothing resulted. The British delegation tabled proposals for the amendment of the Covenant, to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. Although these were examined and elaborated by a League committee in the course of the year, the Assembly last September was unable to adopt any text.The &quot;Tariff Truce Conference&quot; cannot be put on the credit side of the account. The Economic Conference of 1927 had pointed to the dangers and disadvantages of high tariffs and the menace of a tariff war. The members of the League acclaimed this finding and have done nothing except to bury the Tariff Truce in a pauper&apos;s grave. The critic of Geneva may well point to this as the classic instance of the mists of benevolent oratory melting under the hard rays of national individualistic interest. The &quot; tariff truce &quot; was a British proposal, and in lamenting its death we can at least congratulate ourselves on our courage in fathering it and all that it entailed. That was trying the League rather high. As a gesture, it may yet have some effect; as a practical proposal, who shall say that it has yielded much less than we were entitled to expect ?The British proposal for the negotiation of a &quot; Convention for Strengthening the Means of Preventing War&quot; has so far done little more than bring out rather wide divergences of opinion.    The proposals
of the British delegation for the reorganisation of the Secretariat, and for giving some better effect to the Slavery Convention, produced some results, but not what was expected of them. Something is being done as a result of the British lead in the matter of combating the drug traffic, but progress is necessarily slow and very difficult. A Conference at the end of 1929 on the Treatment of Foreigners resulted in rather spectacular failure. Almost the only success that can be recorded was the final agreement on the Treaty of Financial Assistance.Consequently, in the twelve months that elapsed between the Assemblies of 1929 and 1930, the actual balance sheet of the League showed a deal on the debit side. If only for that reason, the delegates would have assembled last September in rather a &quot;morning after the night before &quot; mood. But, of course, the general economic depression, Franco-Italian tension, and, on top of all, the results of the German elections, all combined to produce a general atmosphere of apprehension. Looking back at the hopeful features, as they seemed to be, of 1929, there were now, in September 1930, reasons for misgiving about most of them.The German elections seemed to show that the &quot; Briand &quot; policy in France had been mistaken, and the position of M. Briand himself shaken. The Assembly has failed, so far, to incorporate in its Covenant the principle of the Pact of Paris; this, without necessarily reflecting on the bona fides of the signatories of the pact, made many wonder why exactly they would not write the pact into the Covenant. The first attempt at economic disarmament has had to be abandoned. The London Treaty, great as was its achievement, was not a hundred per cent, success, and the recalcitrance of France and Italy, boded no good for future disarmament negotiations. In 1929, M. Briand had made a brief and vague insinuation about a &quot; United States of Europe.&quot; It was perhaps disconcerting in 1930 to learn, from the explanation, demanded of him, that he was none too clear as to the meaning of that phrase himself. His actual proposals were so tentative and meagre as to emphasise rather the difficulty in the way of a United Europe than the likelihood of its realisation. The high hopes of the 1929 Assembly, .which the United Kingdom delegation had done much to raise, had thus, as we have seen, been considerably dashed.-In its most important field-that of keeper of the peace the League had fortunately been unemployed. It had been enabled to get out of the famous &quot; optants &quot; question. No other dispute of any importance had been referred to it. A cynical observer might say that it was time the League was called upon to settle a really good dispute between almost first-class Powers. It was lucky in 1925 in having the Graeco-Bulgarian dispute to occupy its attention. That was a quite respectable little affray, with all the familiar concomitants of pre-war Balkan outbreaks to give it news value. It was just about adjusted to the growing strength of the League, which managed to handle the matter successfully, and thereby to gain considerable credit. Geneva orators have drawn on it so heavily that it is now practically exhausted. To an observer it seems almost a pity that something new and heavy and soluble cannot devise and present itself.Enough has been said to show why the Assembly of 1930 was necessarily rather gloomy. It is at least to its credit that it did not attempt to blink the facts. And things became uneasier still because, before the end of the year, there came the complaints from the German Government about the treatment of the German minority in Polish Upper Silesia, coupled with veiled threats that Germany, unless she obtained a solution satisfactory to her, would leave the League. This, with an awkward Danzig question being held at arm&apos;s length from the Council, produced an uneasy feeling that Locarno, in settling the western frontier of Germany, had diverted German attention towards the east.Of late an improvement has been produced by two facts, the completion of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference, and the Council action in the matter of the Upper Silesian dispute. The former will, it is being said, let us in for a deal of trouble; but we should have had the trouble ere now without it, and the fact of a more or less agreed decision having been reached shows that the matter is being taken seriously. The latter could be criticised as a typical League &quot;decision,&quot; partaking largely of the nature of a postponement. It certainly remains to be implemented, but in the meanwhile let us be grateful that the Germans are pleased and that the Poles swallowed the pill with reasonable docility. It may be hoped that the reaction will be favourable enough for the Council, in May, to be able to register an advance in the discharge of its responsibility towards the minority, without further embitterment of the relations between the two principals in this rathe sordid drama.[5185]F 2
It is quite easy to be cynical about the League; but so long as it can be gloomy, as it was last year, there is great hope for it. At least the Assembly is not attended exclusively by irresponsible dreamers. Of course they do have their dreams, and some of them will come true. Progress is seldom achieved without looking ahead, and visions of the future always seem absurd to those who have their noses to the ground. The League would be worth nothing if it did not sometimes attempt the impossible. There are always the Governments in the background to put on the brake. The ideal of to-day is very often the commonplace of to-morrow, and the opponents of the &quot; General Act &quot; are rather inclined to regret the good old days of the optional clause (which they fought tooth and nail at the time). If some people are brave and generous enough to risk ridicule by going ahead of their contemporaries, it is really very good of them, because they rarely get their due when the rest of the world eventually reaps the benefit.CONCLUSION.In 1930, then, it seems that a kind of intellectual depression was produced  and spread to other continents amounting almost to a doubt whether Erectus could really be made upright. A year before the continued existence of &quot; the forces of cultivated prejudice and inherent stupidity &quot; was fully recognised, but there was confidence that a regenerated Europe would soon be able to snap her fingers at their black sincerity. It then became clear that those forces are as yet far from dbne with, and capable of mischief to the new edifice of international peace before the roof is on. Mankind, that outcome of carbon, seems at times to the builders still highly inflammable, and his intelligence to have been developed to the extrusion of instinct, even, the instinct of self-preservation. It must be reluctantly admitted that we have not advanced so far or so rapidly as we could wish. The human train of thought is not accelerated by a train going in the opposite direction. There is much thinking and struggling ahead of us, if the old pernicious doctrine of the balance of power is not to creep back. The forces opposed to us are still strong, for it is as true as in the days of Rousseau that &quot; avec un levier suffisant d&apos;un doigt Ton peut ebranler le monde, mais pour le soutenir il faut les epaules d&apos;Hercule.&quot; In 1930 the restlessness of Italy, the determination of Germany to &apos;&apos; get back,&apos;&apos; the mischief-making of Russia, and French fear of all these elements, showed signs of becoming, quite apart from the economic forces at work, levers sufficiently powerful to shake our new world. If, however, the principles of arbitration, disarmament and co-operation are to sustain it as we wish, then &quot; those in favour &quot; will have to apply the shoulders of Hercules to their labours. Moreover, strength alone is not enough, even if we possessed it, and we are visibly emaciated. Even with recovered weight we shall need both courage and patience, especially the latter, for we are likely to do more harm than good by lecturing, particularly in the case of France, who seems to offer a constant temptation to these methods. She is in fact at once too touchy and too strong to stand them.It is becoming clear, or at any rate more highly probable, that we have another critical period ahead, perhaps the most critical we have ever traversed. It is conceivable that this century may have part in deciding whether civilisa-tion, which began as a life-saving hazard or device, will defeat its own end, or whether the species will live out its vast if limited future. Less impressively, we may hope to avoid the question asked by Mr. Weller of matrimony, &quot; whether it&apos;s worth while going through so much to learn so little.&quot; In recognising this there is no cause for panic ; it is in the nature of &quot;the present&quot; to seem uninhabitable, and we need not pay too much heed to the depressionists who pronounce Homo Sapiens at the cross-roads, and shortly to be buried there as a suicide with a stake through his body. If it is a period of transition, what period is not ? And in such periods the old invariably survives by the side of the new. At worst Europe can hate and hold together like many a menage. It is, however, unwise to live on the marches of wrath; for safety we have still to gain time in which the adamite shape of mind may become unnatural to European anatomy, and the protagonists of a living past stand a rank or two deeper among the ghosts; for a great man has hitherto often been one who does something that takes other people a long while to undo. If a crisis can be postponed by timely handling, the present phase might conceivably see the petering out of the old
mettle, since traditional attitudes retain force rather than ardour. During the next ten years or so the old man is likely to be a trial, but he need not be a sentence.Leaving aside for the moment the unexpectedly organised side-show of Herrn Curtius and Schober, the first testing time will be the Disarmament Conference, which may be said to have already begun, although the meeting is fixed for February 1932. Success would, it is believed, definitely set Europe in the right way. Failure, on the other hand, might well set her upon the other path leading back to the jungle of international rivalries and the men of prey. Europe has been asking anxiously and what is said in Europe of course goes further than what is written can success be safely counted upon, especially if Great Britain should comprehensibly feel unable to make any further practical contribution towards that feeling of security which must exist if any real limitation of armament is to be achieved.The more one sees of the psychology and politics of Europe(10) the more seems to depend on England. Mr. Keynes wrote recently on the economic side : &quot; An international cure is essential, and I see the best hope of remedying the inter-national slump in the leadership of Great Britain. But if Great Britain is to resume leadership she must be strong and must be believed to be strong.&quot; There is perhaps nothing new in this. We are all in the same boat, and part of the crew behaves as if it preferred a noyade. The fundamental question that has always confronted humanity- or with which it has confronted itself is whether it shall die serially or in blocks. Ever since we first acquired the ability to examine the conditions of our existence, our chief occupation has been the conscious search for the means of safeguarding our lives. But, with an odd lack of savoir mourir, old Adam appears to prefer the block system, in which, to do him justice, he gets himself included. In this so-called 20th century the means to put it into execution are still over-plentiful. It behoves us, then, to be on the watch and to take nothing for granted. It is at least reassuring that there is a growing confidence in the integrity and disinterestedness of the motives of this country, illustrated perhaps particularly in the Balkans. England is pleasingly less liable than before the war to be had for a mug and abused for a Machiavelli. She is now chiefly criticised for loss of tissue, an element indispensable for a hearing from old Adam. In the pursuit of our own views it is therefore necessary to remind ourselves of Sir Walter Raleigh&apos;s phrase that &quot;whosoever shall follow Truth too near the heels, it may haply strike out his teeth.&quot;How then is Great Britain to make the practical contribution that is expected of her? Here I think Great Britain can have a concrete policy. It has long been in my mind that eventually nothing short of some form of treaty revision will enable Europe permanently to settle down by consent. The pro-position is as unpalatable to me as to anyone else, but I think one. must have the courage to face one&apos;s own previous conviction. I am aware that &quot; mutations are mostly harmful,&quot; and that the most convincing reasons one can find are mostly those for doing nothing. But reason, especially perhaps in France, has always been apt to exclude common sense. Moreover, we cannot cope with dangers without taking risks; and I must risk the charge of prematurity in throwing up such an idea for discussion.For I recognise at once that the idea is premature, although I believe that many minds in France and elsewhere are beginning to work in the same way as my own. (Some are already perhaps clear that 20th-century politics will not use an 18th-century verb : s&apos;enversailler.) For example a neutral one  &quot; Without the League,&quot; said the Norwegian, Herr Mowinckel, recently, &quot; Europe would not have been able to bear the wrongs inherent in the Treaty of Versailles.&quot; We could, of course, in no circumstances consider treaty revision except within the framework of the League : and, unfortunately, it is just not practical politics to envisage any such programme in time to facilitate disarmament prospects in 1932, on which so much depends.Treaty modification let us in future avoid the word &quot;revision,&quot; for words somehow matter to us is at best but a thing that can come, or be brought about, slowly as we get into the way of peace; and peace, as someone said of happiness at the time of the French Revolution, is, after all, &quot; a new idea in Europe.&quot; But(10) &quot; From the very nature of his distinctively human attributes, man experiences a difficulty in seeing clearly the things that most clearly affect himself and his own welfare.&quot; Elliot Smith :Human History.
I believe that we should already have it in our minds as an ultimate necessity. The Disarmament Conference, if it is going to get anywhere, might conceivably have to get to modification at the first stop. We might indeed, if we were unlucky, have the problem in some form thrown upon the council table before we had expected it. It is time therefore that Europe got accustomed to the calm envisagement of the idea. One obviously cannot work towards a thing that is not in one&apos;s mind; and from ours it will with time, that doubtful neutral  make its way in more recalcitrant quarters. The only chance of getting new ideas into the head of Homo Sapiens is to let them percolate, ere it dawns upon him that he may have to act on them. It may well be that, unless we begin to convince ourselves, as prelude to the convincing of others, that the aspect of Europe is not frozen for ever in exactly its present patterns ^and geography is not everything (&quot;) we can look forward to crises as in 1930 and, again if we are unlucky, 1932-with old Adam not only in the ascendant but threatening to become a political dogstar : to one damned thing after another, in fact, though we may be moderately sure of that anyhow.This long-range policy may be wrong; but if it is right, its obvious and only chance is co-operation with France. Fortunately there are indications that she is generally anxious to co-operate with us. We shall have to get rid of much irritability this memorandum may at least have shown that it is possible to treat foreign affairs with good humour and also some of that spirit of contradiction which is so strong in man. For some years past he has inclined, in this country, toward Germany at the expense of France. It is foolish to be pro-anything especially in considerable ignorance since it always means being anti-something else; doubly foolish when that something is French and American. We have to be stone-cold in this if we are to avoid the over-secretions of adrenalin so prevalent in Europe. We can proceed only upon the bases, by no means eventually unrealisable, of the consent and self-interest of those concerned. It would be, for instance, wide of the mark to advocate as some do that the Polish Corridor should be abolished because Germans are worth more than Poles. Our data are far too short to assume that one variant of the species is necessarily better than another. It will be time enough to talk of that many centuries hence; and we have got to get there first. For the present all we can contemplate is the gradual inculcation of both anti-Revisionists and Revisionists with the long-range policy. Thus the former would have to be brought to think if not kindly at least resignedly of modification, the latter to think of it with patience and moderation. Everything will depend on how it is put; the formula would have to be something to the effect that the peace treaties are still the basis of everything, but may need eventual modification in various particulars. If Germany has another year like 1930, it may not be possible to put it at all.Besides this distant aim, we must also keep in sight in 1931 some nearer objectives, such as encouraging all forms of Franco-Italian agreement and of Balkan rapprochement, and the remission of that Habsburg question to the League. Furthermore, in 1919 Europe tried to have it both ways. So far as Germany is concerned, it was attempted at once to make the world safe and difficult for democracy. In spite of backslidings such as the manner of presenting the customs union to the other Governments of Europe, the present German Government is as good as we are likely to get. Any change would be, at present, disastrously for the worse. Fortunately it is showing marked signs of making good.  It is in our interest to support it.The issue of the Young plan has happily receded since the New Year; but it may well tend to recur, failing satisfaction elsewhere. On this issue I think we should establish, and keep, some contact with the Government of the United States. Our own informal warnings at&apos; the end of last year had a most salutary effect. They may need to be reinforced. This would in no way conflict with the description already given of American policy. It would be a question of words rather than deeds; and such words would be in consonance with the interests, real or imaginary, of the present rather shaky American Administration.&quot;1931 will be a fateful year,&quot; a German statesman has asserted. &quot;In its course Europe will have to decide whether to advance or fall back.&quot;   Few, I(n) Does anyone, even in the United States, believe, except on the principle of credo quia absurdum, that reparations and war debts will run their course?(&quot;) E.g,, Poland may in time come to realise that the corridor would be untenable in case of real trouble, and the still more, distasteful truth that France neither could nor would afford her any material assistance in such an event. France, I would suggest, is now reasonably covered at home, and has no other plans or possibilities.
think, will quarrel with this view. And, when all is said in this memorandum, there is some comfort in the original sin of the old Adam. Indeed, if the pursuit of good be better for us than its attainment, there is yet room for positive backslapping. Such doctrines are at least more comfortable than those of our latest anthropologists, who assure us with much proof that dawn-man was a pacifist full of thalamic goodness and that violence is, therefore the product of civilisation. The eventual choice is whether we are to enjoy the benefits of this civilisation, such as it is or can be, without being crushed by it. So much depends upon us, and upon our constant and wakeful realisation of the dualism of the modern world, that I make no apology for the length of this memorandum, &quot; having no time to make it shorter.&quot;ROBERT VANSITTART.
