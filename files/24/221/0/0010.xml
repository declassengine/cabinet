p 0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. CABINET, COPY NO,    SCP. 110  (31)HOURS    OF    &quot;WORK    OF    SALARIED   EMPLOYEES.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.The International Labour Conference at Geneva last June adopted a Convention and three Recommendations, of which copies arc attached.; regarding the hours of salaried employees.     We must now decide upon our action in respect of each of these.The convention a      My colleagues will remember that our attitude at the Conference was that we did not know   enough of the facts of employment in the diverse occupations covered by the term &quot;salaried employees&quot; to enable us to assist in drawing up an International Convention (C.P. 166 (30)).      Consequently cur representatives tookno active part in the debates, and they abstained from voting.    The United Kingdom Workers&apos;  representative voted against the adoption of the Convention in Committee and abstained from voting when the Convention was before the Conference.Our attitude in this matter has been justified by the event. The Convention adopted by the Conference is even wider in scope than the proposal in view of which we decided our policy.    It covers not only commercial,  trading and administrative establishments of all kinds hut also the clerical brancnes of hospitals, of hotels and restaurants and of theatres and of all similar undertakings (Article 1 of the Convention),      On the other hand the Convention permits so many exceptions that it is impossible to hope that it will lead to the adoption of anything in the nature of an international standard of hours regulation (See especially Article 7.1.(c)  of the Convention).      In these circumstances I have no hesitation in proposing that we should decide not to ratify the Convention.1. /The
The Recommendations.      These are integrally bound up with the Convention.    They provide for investigations to be made into conditions of employment in (a) hotels,  restaurants9 boarding-houses,  etc.,  (b)  theatres and other places of public amusement and (c)  establishments for the care of the side, infirm9 destitute or mentally unfit.    If this were all, we could possibly accept then hut the preamble of each of them makes it quite clear that acceptance implies accepting the provisions of the Draft Convention and deciding in advance to extend their application to the trades dealt with in the Recommendations.      This is entirely opposed to the policy we have followed hitherto, namely, that only when the facts were known could a decision properly be taken as to the best method of dealing with the conditions disclosed.Accordingly I propose that in announcing our decision we should once more restate our general attitude to the subject and add that consequently we are unable to r atify the Convention nor can we accept the Recommendations which postulate an endorsement of its provisions,.At the same time I propose that we should mention the investigations which have been end are still being made into conditions in the kinds of undertakings covered by the Convention and Recommendations.    Thus we can point to the active work of the Select Committee into Hours and Conditions of Employment in Shops and to the enquiries made in 1925 and 1929 into the wages and hours in all branches of the Catering Trade,  adding that the first steps have already been taken with a view to bringing the Catering Trade under the Trade Boards Acts.(intld.)
