THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITAMIO MAJESTYTS GOYEK3MEHT./ &quot;CRET. 5&quot;.127.  (51). COPY HO ............CAB I 3Sf E T. RURAL HOUSING. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.1. Since my memorandum on Rural Housing, CP.104(31),was circulated to the Cabinet, negotiations have taken place &quot;between the Lord Privy Seal and Sir Tudor Walters on &quot;behalf of the Liberal Party.2. As a result of these negotiations Sir Tudor Waltershas abandoned his original proposals hut is anxious that some -plan should be adopted which, while lo&amp;ving loos-l authorities responsible for the provision of houses, would enable additional assistance to be given to those authorities who are unable, by reason of their financial position, to meet the housing needs of their area.3. There is no doubt that there are some rural district-councils in most counties and several urban district councils in the coalfields and elsewhere whose rate resources are so strained that they are unable, without further assistance, to make the housing provision which is needed in their areas. While I am strenuously opposed to any departure from the policy laid down in the Housing Act of 1930 such as the original proposals of the Liberal Party for the setting up of an executive Housing Board involved, I cannot object to further provision being made for the necessitous areas,   and I have therefore drawn up the outline of a plan (appended to this memorandum) which, while leaving the principles of the Housing Act of 1930 intact, will, I understand, secure the agreement of the Liberal Party.4* As regards rural housing, however, the County./:&apos;vi;Councils were empowered by the Housing Act of 1930 to give
the necessary additional financial assistance to the v/eak rural district councils to enable them to meet their housing needs.     She County Councils have been asked to report by the 31st May on the housing conditions in their rural areas, and what, if any, financial assistance they are prepared to give to rural district councils in addition to the statutory county contribution of  1 a house for 40 years in respect of houses occupied by agricultural workers.     It is essential, therefore, if the scheme is adopted, that no formal announcement of it should he made until the returns of the County Councils have been received and examined.     In the meantime, the necessary preparations can be made for the legislation which will be required to give effect to the scheme.5. I should have no misgivings about the scheme Ihave proposed to meet the wishes of the Liberal Party if it could be restricted to the grant of further assistance in the provision of houses for agricultural workers.     I am, however, clear that it cannot be so restricted and that it must be applied to the necessitous urban areas.      It would be politically impossible to give help to rural areas and withhold it from the   distressed urban areas whose need is as great and whose financial position is even more precarious.     But Z.must warn my colleagues that the application of the scheme to urban areas is very difficult and may be prejudicial to housing generally.     However definite the conditions of the seheme may be in its application to urban areas, there will be a demand for inclusion from many authorities who cannot be regarded as necossitous and would ordinarily proceed with a substantial building programme;      and there may be a tendency on the part of these authorities to hold their hands in the hope of securing better terms.loth May, 1931. (intld.)    A.G.2.
9 Z QAPPMDIX.farther financial assistance for housing.1. A Committee (Housing Special Grants Committee) tobe appointed by the Government to consider representations by Local Authorities (primarily Rural District Councils) who are unable by reason of their financial position to make adequate provision to meet their working class housing needs without further Exchequer assistance, and to make recommendations for the giving of further assistance. 2. The chief object to be aimed at is the provision in rural districts of houses for the accommodation, of the agricultural population at suitably low rents - ordinarily not more than say 4/6d. a week inclusive of rates. 3. It would be necessary to define by a &quot;poverty&quot;formula the districts which would be eligible for consideration but the Committee would be given a wide discretion as regards the districts to be assisted, the number of houses in each district for which assistance should be given and the amount of assistance.     They would have regard to the rate resources of the district, the existing level of rates and the charge for housing already provided in the district.4. In the case of some districts it would no doubt benecessary to givo special assistance which would leave no charge at all on the rates beyond the statutory county contribution of  1 a year for 40 years in England and Wales. In tho case of other districts less necessitous, a local rate contribution of some kind would be provided and the special assistance suitably adjusted.
5. The Committee would endeavour to secure theprovision of houses of the small non-parlour, three bedroom type, at an all-in cost of not more than  350.    (They could at the outset limit their assistance to houses proposed to be provided at or under this cost).6. It would be a condition of grant that the rentsshould not be in excess of a figure to bo approved by the Committee and that any houses provided for agricultural workers should continue to be occupied by members of the agricultural population.7. The following statement shows the special assistance which would be required in respect of a house costing  350 provided in an agricultural parish for an agricultural worker;-Rate of Interest 4fg Total cost ................  350Present value of exchequer subsidy of  11 a year for40 years...............     196Present value of county contribution of  1 ayear for 40 years......       18  214Cost not covered byassistance.............  136Loan charges for 60 years........ 6.17.4.Allowance for repairs,management,  loss of rents etc.averaged over 60 years........... 5.18.0* 10.15.4.Rent at 3/- a week............. . . 7 ..I6.0 .(exclusive of rates) 2.19.4.equivalent to a present oapital value of  59.8. If no charge is to fall on the local districtrate,  special assistance equivalent to a present capital valueof  59 would be required.    If this were given by way of grant for 40 years it would amount to about  3.6.0.a year. It would be
C% I&quot; o2 d 8for the Committee to determine, after considering the representations of the authority, to what extent, if any, a charge should fall on the local district rate and in what proportions the total loss of  3.6.0. a year for 40 years should be shared between the local rate and the Exchequer. 9. It is believed that, in most cases in which theneed for houses at low agricultural rents Is not being met, it is finance which stands in the way and that, if suitable further financial assistance were given, the houses required would be provided by the local district councils (The 1930 Act relies on this necessary extra assistance being provided by the County Councils but does not put any obligation on the County Councils to provide it beyond the fixed contribution of  1 a house fur 40 years.     There is little doubt that, If further grants are made by the Exchequer, no additional financial assistance will be forthcoming from the County Councils). There may, however, be a few small Rural District Councils who have not the necessary technical equipment to undertake work of this kind efficiently and cannot make satisfactory arrangements to obtain it from the County Councils.     It is suggested that the Committee should have power to recommend that in suitable cases the Office of Works as agents for the local authority should provide the houses required in accordance with proposals approved by the Committee. 10. As it would be politically Impossible to restrictany scheme for further financial help only to houses for agricultural workers It is proposed that- the Committee should have power also to consider representations from any necessitous local authority and recommend that grants should be made in respect of houses to be provided by them for the working
^ 3 9classes generally.      It is  suggested, however, that a stricter test of poverty should he applied in the case of the urban areas. 11. The scheme of assistance should be regarded as anemergency measure and only applications made by a specified date,  in respect of a number of houses which can be completed within a period of 18 months,   should be considered.      The aggregate capital value of the grants t o be recommended by the Committee should not exceed  2,000,000 for Great Britain.    The annual charge falling on the Exchequer would be approximately  112,000 for 40 years in addition to the  charge in respect of the ordinary housing grants payable under the Acts of 1924 and 1930.      The additional Exchequer charge in the present financial year would be considerably less than one-half the full annual liability.12. The scheme outlined in this memorandum has beenprepared by reference to the conditions in England and Wales. Certain adaptations would be required to make it applicable to the local government and other conditions in Scotland.
