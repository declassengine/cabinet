THE WHEAT 3U0TA SYSTEM.By causing an increase in the price of oread to the ccn-suaer, although small, the quota scheme as outlined in the memo,  of the Minister of Agriculture admits the principle of taxing food as a necessity for rehabilitating the agricultural industry,  and for this reason is not only con-trary to our basic principle that the many should not be taxed for the benefit of the few, but would in our opinion, be politically fatal.The principle once conceded there could be no logical refusal to the demand of other sections of agriculturists i.e., barleyj oats, cheese, bacon producers,  steel and iron manufacturers and other industrialists, who complain of foreign competition depriving them of the market for their productions for similar treatment.The Tories and Empire Free Traders would assert, with justification,  that we had yielded their case to them and the Liberals would point to it as proof that we had deliberately increased the price of the -people&apos;s food for the benefit of one section of agriculture in such a manner tnat the poorest families who eat most bread would be taxed most heavily.That the amount was small would be no effective answer is evidenced by the strong protest of the German workers&apos; housewives to the imposition of  d on the loaf and the threatened split in the German Cabinet on the question -the Socialist LLP.   &apos;s contending strongly for its abolition (&quot;Hews and Chronicle April 24/51&quot;.)The alternatives seem to be (l) The thorough operation of Part I of the Agricultural Land (utilisation) Bill&apos;s large scale farming experiments on the land where it i.s stated Wheat cultivation is not at present economical - the Minister
of Agriculture stated on 2nd Reading that to be one of the main reasons for the introduction of that part of the Bill., It is claimed that  substantial economies have been effected by large scale methods over a large area and that wheat was actually grown at a profit last year by their use.(2)      Lxperiments have proved that good crops of other produce in a rotation excluding wheat have been grown on poor light land in Bast Suffolk and that cows, pigs and sheep and puultiy can be kept with profit.      Greater and more intensive efforts along these lines we believe are possible and practical and would yield satisfactory results,(o)      The establishment of an Import Board on the lines laid down in the Labour Party&apos;s policy on Agriculture (1926), the effect of which would be to guarantee a market for home grown wheat at  stabilised prices for short or long periods according to the fluctuations or stability of world price levels.vJe are deeply concerned with the threatened wage reductions but we do not see that a protected market with guaranteed prices for wheat alone,  leaving the landlords and rents uncontrolled, would secure any material improvement in the workers1  wages,.      &quot;The Land worker51 for April 1931 states tnat    &quot;The farm workers have got nothing out of the beet subsidy - thousands of acres have been grown and lifted wit la-out a penny extra coming to the workers,  and the county of Suffolk where  the farmers made very large profits on beet last season initiated the cutting down of wages,&quot;ive believe the price is too largo to pay for perpetuating and stereotyping old methods and as in other industries we urge tnat reorganisation and new methods are the remedy for depression, so we feel that to be the line of true development for agri-culture..
We are strongly-of opinion that fixing a price for home-grown wheat at a figure that involves an artificial subsidy, especially in the form of a tax on consumers, would make our position indefensible in the large industrial centres and do us irreparable political injury.(Signed)    J.H. ALPASSo FRED.  GOULD.-3-
MEtCBANDUM TO THE PRIMS MINISTER ON TJ-Tg  ;tQTJOTA,;.(l) In our view(a) cereal growing is essential to arable farming inextensive districts; (&quot;b) there is no alternative to the key crop;, wheat, inthe rotation of crops in these districts, (a) the present position which involves claims for the reduction in wages is desperate, and is rapidly worsening: (d) without legislative aid this form of agriculturewill be largely abandoned, with its obvious result to employment and waste of national resourceso 7fe understand that the Import Board included in the Party&apos;s policy is at present out of the questions    &quot;Ws therefore believe that an immediately practical step is the quota schemeo (2)        In our opinion the quota system is administratively practicableo It will give economic security to the home market and will preserve cheap imports and leave untouched feeding stuffs-. It will give a home marketing board without interfering with international marketing.The Government policy in regard to coal produced atuneconomic prices establishes a precedent.So do the fixing of Railway rates upon a basis of wagecosts, etc.,  and the Electricity Board provides anotherprecedents    The Trade Union policy is founded upon theprinciple that a living wage should be a first charge uponindustry.(3) The Government has given a pledge, ands in ouropinion, failure to r edeem that pledge will d o us more harmthat a courageous effort to carry it out, with any political risks involved.
(4) Those risks are founded on the suggestions:-(a)      That a quota vd.ll put up the price of &quot;bread.It should be noted that the average price of bread in the last ten years was 9o7d.  per quartern loaf.    The average price is now 7d. The maximum increase due to a quota premium of 15$ would be ^-/Srd. of Id. per 4 lb. loaf if all the increase were passed on.  In view, however, of the existing large margin between the price of flour and bread (vide millers&apos;  own published figure), there would be no justification for this difference;  the scheme provides for the &quot;&quot;heat Commission to deal with this position, and definite powers should be taken to reduce these high costs.(b)      That we are violating free trade principles.In our opinion many Socialists are in danger of confusing Free Trado with cut-throat competition.while we are absolutely opposed to the clumsy and proved ineffectual method of tariffs, we consider that free competition is not a part of our policy; that it was abandoned in regard to coal in favour of control, and we hope to see an early extension of that control to Cereals.(5) In our opinion there must come a definite partingof the ways between those who only think in terms of cheap prices at anybody&apos;s expense and those who wish to see price based upon wage costs*    It is impossible for a Socialist to defend prices below the economic cost of production.!    In rvuni-cipal socialism we have accepted the principle of price based upon monopoly and scientific costing, it remarkable^nis to extend that principle to the basic industries.    Are industrial wages to be &quot;brought to  the level of coolie labour?- Are English labourers to accept permanently the standard of life of food growers abroad - notoriously the lowest paid of all workers?
(6)7e therefore believe that the necessary legislation providing for the Quota scheme should be passed and that the setting up of a Central Y,rages Board with the necessary powers to ensure a reasonab living wage for agricultural workers should be an essential part of any such Quota legislations(Signed)    Mo PHILIPS PRICE,(M.P.).ETTo   (MoP.).
