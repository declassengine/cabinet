448DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.f^T .COPY NO.   5&quot; 145 (31).CABINET, RURAL HOUSING. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.In pursv.an.ee of the decision reached on Fay 20th (Cabinet 29(31) Conclusion 2) J have &quot;been considering various forms of scheme for the further assistance of housing in necessitous rural areas5 but certain difficulties have arisen from the differences&apos; in the circumstances of Scotland and of England and Wales.The scheme which I had contemplated was one which would have given assistance for the housing of the agricultural population (as defined in Section 34 of the Housing Act, 1930) in any rural district satisfying (to establish its poverty) certain conditions as to the product and the poundage level of rates.    This scheme &apos; presented the great advantage in administration of linking the responsibilities of the County Council (under the Housing Acts 1930) with those of the State and of the Rural District Councils who are in England and Wales the primary housing authority.    It would have mets so far as England and Wales are concerned., the difficulty arising frorn the limitation of the customary wage of the agrisultural worker and his consequent inability to pay the rent chargeable under the Act of 1924 as well as the difficulty of the Rural District -Councils&apos;  inability or reasonable unwillingness to undertake a furthe rate charge for housing.On discussion., however, with the Secretary of State for Scotland, it is found that a scheme on these lines would give comparatively little benefit to the rural areas of Scotland.    I am advised that the great bulk of the agricultural workers of Scotland live in tied cottages and pay no direct rent., and that it is out of the question to suppose either that local authorities will build for the agricultural workers, or that the agricultural workers will
449move into cottages for which they will have to pay a direct renteIn these circumstances it has &quot;been suggested that so far as Scotland wsb Concerned the additional Exchequer assistance should be given in respect not of the agricultural population as defined (for England and Wales) in the Act of 1930, but of agricultural workers and persons of substantially the same economic condition as agricultural workers living in the rural areas. Such a scheme would make the additional assistance available for the housing of fishermen and other occupants of the necessitous landward areas of Scotland including. I understand9 a small proportion of miners and other industrial workers who satisfy the limitation of &quot;like economic condition&quot; to that of the agricultural workercWe cannot j however  contemplate the submission to Parliament of a scheme having two so different objectives in the two countries and it would be impossible to give assistance to all necessitous Rural District Councils in respect of houses for the occupation of persons of the like economic condition to agricultural workers0   The classification and nomenclature of local government areas in this country is largely accidentals and &quot;bears but little reference to the actual characteristics of the different areasc   A large number of rural districts so called are urban in character0    Thus the Durham coalfield consists almost entirely of rural districtss the corresponding South Wales   coalfield almost entirely of urban districts9  and it is out of the question that assistance should be given in one coalfield and withheld from the other.In these circumstancess having regard to the Cabinet decision, the only possible course is to limit the definition of
450rural areas &quot;by some test (in addition to that of poverty) so as to exclude the industrial parts of rural districts..I see no insuperable difficulty in the way of a scheme drawn on these lines and satisfying the conditions of &quot;both countries; though I am hound to regret some loss of simplicity and of administrative convenience which is invoivedo    The scheme which I fyad favoured would he modified so as (a) to extend to the housing of persons of like economic condition to agricultural workers and (h) to rule out parishes which though in rural districts are not &quot;agricultural parishes&quot; within the definition given in Section 60 of the Housing Act; 1930.T must; however; point out that, while this definition is a generous one, there are agricultural workers, with a need for low rented houses5 living in parishes which are not &quot;agricultural&quot; in districts whose Councils are likely to satisfy any reasonable test of poverty,,    The Minister of Agriculture, with whom the matter has been discussed, has suggested that the scheme should be extended so as to include assistance in respect of houses for the occupation of agricultural workers in non-agricultural parishes,,    If it should be decided ,that the difficulties of this course ought to be faced, the scheme can be amended to meet it, but it seems to me to be difficult to defend an extension to non-agricultural parishes of assistance for agricultural workers; if persons of &quot;like economic condition&quot; are to remain excluded,,    It is common ground that workers of1 ike economic condition&quot; in non-agricultural parishes cannot be admitted to the benefit of the new proposals.I attach (A) a detailed scheme giving effect to my proposals and (B) a statement showing the heads of the necessary Bill.AcG,th June,  193lo i3.
451A.Scheme for asaisting necessitous Rural District Councils to provide houses for a gr ic u 11 u r g 1 ^ w or ke r a and for per sons of sub-stantially tip same economic condition as agricultural workers in agricultural parishes.1. A Committee (Housing Special Grants Committee) willbe appointed by the Minister with the approval of the Treasury.   The Committee will consist of not more than six members with a Secretary who is to be an officer of the Ministry of Health and is to be assisted by representatives (including if desirable technical officers) of the Ministry.2. The Committee will consider applications for special assistance made by rural district councils who claim to be unable, on grounds of finance, to make adequate provision for meeting in agricultural parishes as defined in Section 60 of the Housing Act, 1950, the need for houses for agricultural workers and for persons of substantially the same economic condition.3. Application for special grant may be made by councils of rural districts in which -(i) the estimated product for the year 1931/2 of a rate of one penny in the pound (estimated in accordance with the Rating and Valuation (Produce of Rates and Precepts) Rules, 1929) does not exceed fourpence per head of the population according to the 1931 Census;    and (ii) the poundage of the general rates levied in theyear 1930/1 exceeded ten shillings  or the general level of the poundage of the total rates levied in the several parishes of the district is such that
452the Council are unable to make adequate housing provision.Provided that the Committee may consider an application from a rural district council who cannot satisfy the first condition if the council can show that houses cannot be provided at rents which agricultural workers can afford to pay without imposing a rate charge on the area in excess of  3. 15/- a house for 40 years.4. Applications for special assistance are to be made ina form approved by the Minister and forwarded in duplicate to the Committee not later than 30th November, 1931.5. The special assistance which the Committee mayrecommend will be in the form of annual grants payable in addition to the Exchequer contribution payable in respect of the houses under the Housing etc. Act,  1924.    The annual grants will be fixed in amount for a period of 40 years but they will not be uniform in amount for all local authorities, or for different groups of houses for the same local authority.6. The Committee,  after considering the specialcircumstances of each local authority, the necessary cost  of the houses,  and the extent to which the rate charge payable by the lecal authority under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924.,  creates an unreasonable burden on the locality,  shall in its recommendations specify -(1) the number and type of houses  in respect of which special assistance may be given; (2) the date by which those houses are to becompleted;(3) the rent at which the houses are to be let;
453(4) the amount of the special annual grant to hefixed in respect of the houses for which assistance is recommended.Where the Committee have considered an application from a council who cannot satisfy condition (-1) of paragraph 3 the assistance will he limited to such sum as is required to reduce the rate charge to  3. 15/- a year for 40 years.7* Save in exceptional circumstances the committee shall not make recommendations in respect of houses other than non-parlour houses of an all-in estimated cost of about  550 (in Scotland  400)*8. In determining the amount of the annual grant tobe paid the Committee shall endeavour to secure that the rents, inclusive of rates, shall not exceed 4/6d. per week.9. The special grants will be payable only if thehouses are completed by the date, and let at the rents recommended by, the Committee.10. The present capital values of the grants shallnot in the aggregate exceed  1,760,000 for England and Wales and  240,000 for Scotland (Interest being reckoned at the rate of 4-ffc).11. If in any particular case the Committee considerthat a rural district council has  not the necessary technical equipment to undertake a Housing Scheme efficiently and recommend that the Office of Works should act for the Council, the Minister may.  with the consent of the Treasury.,
454make arrangements with the Office of works for the carrying out of an approved Scheme on behalf of,  and at the expense of , the . Counc 11.12. In the application of the Scheme to scotland the Department of Health for Scotland would be substituted for the Minister, County Councils would be substituted for Rural District Councils and &quot;rural areas as defined in section 16 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, as amended by section 46 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930, for agricultural parishes.    The rate limits which would be laid down as a test of necessity would be four-fifths of those suggested for England and Wales and the local authority1 normal contribution would be taken to be  4. 10/- per house for forty years.   A separate Committee would be appointed for the purposes of the Scheme in Scotland.
