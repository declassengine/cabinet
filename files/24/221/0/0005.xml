Note by the Secretary.At the 252nd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence held on March 19th, 1931,  it was recommended (Conclusion 4(b);)., at the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion, that the question of preparations for national defence being detrimentally affected owing to the financial control of important British industries falling into foreign hands, should be referred to the Cabinet.The attacned note is circulated to the Cabinet by request of the Lord Chancellor as Chairman of the Sub-Committee on War Emergency Legislation, which reported on the matter to the Committee of Imperial Defence.(Sgd.) MVP.A.  HANKEY.Secretary to the Cabinet.II Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., April 23rd, 1931,.
Foreign Financial Control of British Industries as affecting National Defence;1.      The question of American control of certain British industries was&apos;originally brought to the notice of the Economic Advisory Council in a Memorandum, the more important extracts of which are attached as an Appendix to this note.2.      The Council were of opinion that on economic grounds no action was required and that  if there did exist any need for enquiry it would be on military or other general grounds. This question was therefore brought to thenotice of the War Emergency Legislation Sub-Committee, of which the Lord Chancellor is Chairman, as the body most directly concerned with providing the necessary  safeguards in time of war. /3.      This Sub-Committee considered the question and agreed that the contingency envisaged is remote at present,and,  in the unhappy event of an emergency arising,  couldbe amply guarded against by regulations.        Such action wouldcertainly be effective on the outbreak of an emergency.The Sub-Committee,  however,  considered it conceivable that foreign controlling interests,  if evilly intentioned,might in peace time be able to affect adversely thenational resources for defence.        To take an extreme case,it is possible that foreign interests, if so disposed,could :-(a) Starve experiment and research;(b) Let machinery and plant indispensable for war production fall into disrepair;(c) Deplete stocks of essential war materials.
4.     The Sub--Committee considered it their duty to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the matter and to suggest that the Department or Departments concerned should be charged with the duty of reporting from time to time as to the extent to which foreign financial interests have control of important business industries.(Intd,) Mc P.A.H.
(Lb--fcra ct from ^memorandum on Amor loan control of British Industryx x.0*The following are instances of control or the assets of British Companies have &quot;boon purchased by American interests in recent limes.-The control of the Greater London and Counties Trust was acquired in. February 1929 by the American Utilities power and Light Corporation.An American Company has a substantial holding in the Motropolitan-vickers and British Thorns on-Houston fusion-.Whitehall Electric Investments, with a capital of million, sold its assets (situated in Chile and Mexico) to American interests in October 1928-.A partial American financial interest in Graesser and Company, an important chemical undertaking in this country, has been converted into a hundred per cent, ownership by the Monsanto Chemical Works of Sto Louis, Uo SoA.4o      So far as concerns British undertakings I n South America and elsewhere abroad there can be 1 title doubt that the advantage lies in retaining these interests if we are able to d o so-. Speaking generally,   they provide a market for exports which would otherwise be losto    There is reason to believe,   too,  that the secret wishes of the South American States generally accord with our interests-.bo      As regards purchases of businesses operating in this country it is well to remember that the American interests usua].ly pay a good price and that the large capital sums thus received by British shareholders are immediately available for investment in ether enterprises here.    There is every reason to think also that the introduction of American methods of management into Industry &apos; in this country may in seme instances be extremely salutary.The main opposing considerations are as follows:--ftExport business might be diverted to t he United States-.(b) A business here controlled by a similar business inAmerica might be starved of work in order to provide mere employment in America in the event of a serious depression there-(c) Research departments in this country might bo closed down, and this country to that extent denuded of an efficient research, service-.(d) American technicians might come to be introduced Inconsiderable numbers Into British businesses-.(e) If the concerns acquired are really important factors in national production end therefore impossible to ignore in the preparation of plans for national defence in the event of war,  the Information as to ouch plans which reaches the managements would be passed on to American principals..7o    But, while these dangers can be visualised they have not so far been expedience do
8,     Real difficulty would be much more likely to arise if American interests sought to purchase the control of&quot;some vital industryP for instance, the great Banks, the great shipping firms0 or the great armament firms. Public opinion would be likely to be stirred and some definite expression of policy from the Government would be demandeda9,     Apart from the general question of public ownership, at least six methods of preventing the foreign control of a British Company have been oanvassed;-(a) Restricting the right of persons other than British subjects to hold sharese(b) Disfranchising shareholders who are not British subjects,,(c) Giving the Directors of a Company the power to approve or disallow transfers0(d) Limiting the number of votes that may be exercised by a srrngle shareholder, including his nominees,,(e) Creating a voting trust0(f) Limiting the Board of Directors to British subjects,.There are various War precedents for the - prohibition of the acquisition of certain kinds of property, and of the conducting of certain kinds of business, by foreign controlled companiesc     These provisions were the product of War conditionso     If it were proposed that statutory restrictions should be imposed with this object in time of peace they would apparently have to be of much the same nature and it is unlikely that they would easily gain public assent,,      Whether it is necessary to have such powers in reserve and whether there are alternative means of avoiding such danger as there may be to essential British interests are matters which it is suggested require careful review,.
