The Committee met at the House of Commons on June 8th, 1931, Mr. Henderson presiding.      Mr, Henderson said he would proceed on the assumption that all the members of the Committee had read the Report.recommendations of the Majority Report set out in the Summary on pages 50 and 51 of the Report.in Paragraphs 72-91 for more closely balancing income and expenditure of the unemployment Fund with&quot; a live register of 8,500,000 unemployed, but the Committee, without it was then decided to consider forthwith theThe Committee took note of threcommendations made
482expressing any final opinion, considered that theso. recommendations could he more appropriately dealt with when legislation arising out of a final Report was under consideration.      In the opinion of the Committee this would also apply to the transitional benefit recommendations in paragraphs 92-102 of the Report, other than the extension of period mentioned in paragraph 94.5,&apos;        In this connection the Committee draw attention, to the following extract from paragraph 2 of the Minority Report on page 53 of the Report.    The Committee are in full agreement with the view expressed in this paragraph that these large issues of policy should he reserved until the receipt of the final Report :-&quot;We regret that it was considered necessary for the Commission to present an interim Report on these lines at this stage0 The Commission has under consideration proposals which involve the whole scope of an Unemployment Insurance Scheme. There has not yet been time to hear and consider the many interests concerned, or to review the evidence that has already been received,,     All proposals, therefore, which involve large issues of policy, are properly reserved for the final Report&quot;.
A 996- The Minister of Labour has pointed out the particular difficulties in the case of the cxten ion of transitional benefit.      It is recommended by the Commission that the extension of transitional benefit should be subject to special conditions, one of which is that certain classes of claimants for such benefit should be required to prove that, having regard to their circumstances,  it is expedient that benefit should be paid to them.      The classes are:-Single persons living with relatives who can keep them;    married women whose husbands are in employ-ment and can keep them (and married men whose wives can keep them); and persons in receipt of any fixed income or pension,  other than a war disability pension or income from savings. The decision whether benefit should be paid and,  if so,  at what rates,  is to be made by a statutory authority sitting locally,  with a final appeal in suitable cases to a higher authority c&quot;Ovea?ing a larger area.      The Court of Referees and the Umpire should not have  luPi-ts^lation on these points. While extended benefit existed,  similar classes T^e-eived benefit only if it were in the public interest, and the decision was taken vy the Minister.      Under the Commission&apos;proposal, new statutory machinery will be required, and, as the new statutory authorities - ill be taking decisions, instead of merely giving advice, an independent Chairman for the two local assessors will be required and appeal machinery will also have to be set up.    The MiniRter is required to prescribe general principles.    This will involve fixing general standards of income for the guidance of the tribunals and other difficult questions,  e.g. whether the same basis.
should he adopted for- rural and industrial areas, what relatives should be reasonably expected to sup-oort the claim ants,   etc., there will also be the difficulty of verifying the claimant&apos;s statement as to his resources. 7. With regard to the anomalies referred to inParagraphs 103-125,  the Committee were of the opinion that the Minister of Labour shoul   forthwith examine the various categories of anomalies dealt with in Paragraphs 109,   114,   117-120,  122-125 of the Report,  with a view to recommendations being submitted to the Cabinet as to those which could he incoroor ted in immediate legislation. The Minister of Labour&apos;s suggestions are set out in the following paragraphs, and the Committee now submit them to the Cabinet for acceptance.        The Royal Commission make four proposals with a view to dealing with anomalies.8.    (l)      The first proposal is that -workers who habitually work for only two days or less in each -week should not be rega rded as unemployed for the rest of the week, and should therefore be ineligible for benefit,  though they may claim exemption from contributions.
s 69.        The classes which the Commission had in mind are certain types of shop assistants, barmen, market porters, sandwichmen, bill distributors and certain workers in the printing and laundry trades.10.      The Committee think that this recommendation ought to be adopted.    The numbers involved may not be large, but there is no d.doubt that the drawing of benefit by persons of the classes mentioned brings the scheme into grave disrepute.      The Committee suggest therefore that the provision should be to the following effect :-11.      A person who is habitually employed In insurable emplosrraent in not more than two days of the week shall be(a) entitled to a certificate of exemption;    and(b) disqualified for the receipt of unemployment benefit.12.      Any question arising under this provision shall be decided in the first instance by an insurance officer with the same right of appeal to a Court of Referees and the Umpire,as in the case of a claim for benefit.15.(2)      The second proposal is that casual and short-time workers in receipt of high earnings should not receive more benefit for any period comprising employment and unemploy-ment than the full amount of benefit for the whole of such a period, less half the earnings for the period.
48614.In the form in which it is given,  the Commission&apos;proposal appears to he un\7orkable:.It seems imoossible tofind a definition of casual and short-time workers which could not he easily evaded, and if such a definition could he found, it is very difficult, if not impossible,  to administer a system by which the amount of benefitare t&apos;i be taken into account at all they must be the earnings for a pay period ending en an earlier date, but ascertainment and verification of earnings would be extremely difficult in any event.      An alternative which is possible, if applied to all claimants, would be to take account only of days of employment (not the amount of earnings)  and disallow benefit according to some form of sliding scale, e0g,,  each day of employment to cancel one day of unemployment for benefit purposes.15c THE COMiHTTIjU recommend that the principle shouldbe approved and that a clause should be drafted to give effect to it,  if a workable scheme can be devised.16.(5) The third proposal is that a married woman should be entitled to benefit only if she proves that she has not abandoned insurable -anployment and that she can reasonably expect to get it in the district she lives in.17. TIE CCIvlIITTES are agreed that there is a realabuse     of-unknown dimensions a rising from the receipt of benefit by certain married women,      The trouble about the Commission?s proposal is that in order to remove this  abuse     every married woman, even the large number who are bona fide workers and properly entitle d to benefit&apos;when they are unemplry-ed, must go through adepends on the earnings for the current week.If earnings
487special procedure,,      The desirable thing would he to find some means of exempting the bona fide married woman worker from this procedure while subjecting the non-bona fide one to it0     The Department and the Commission have been quite unable to devise a method of doing this extent      The Committee recommend the adoption of the proposal in principle as a purely interim measur and that careful consideration should be given to the actual wording of the proposed provision on -the draft of the Bill.18a  (4)  The fourth and last proposal is that a seasonalworker should only draw benefit in the &quot;off season&quot; if he proves that he has worked in an insurable occupation in the &quot;off season&quot; in - the past and is likely to do so in future in his home district,,19. This is a reasonable recommendation and the&apos;Committee are agreed that it  should be adopted substantially in the form given   cn page 51* ,20, The Committeefs Conclusions and recommenda-tions may be summarised as follows:-(l) As regards the recommendations summarised in paragraph 129 of the Report3  designed to secure more closely that the income and expenditure of the Unemployment Fund may be &quot;brought to balancing point with the live register of 23500s.000 and those relating to transitional &quot;benefit,, without expressing any final opinion,,  the Committee consider that these recommendations (other than the proposal for the extension of the transit-ional period mentioned in paragraph 94) could more appropriately be dealt with when legislation arising out of the final report is under examination.
488(2) The Committee draw special attention tothe considerations relating to Transitional Benefit set out in paragraph 6 of this Reporte(3) As regards the anomalies summarised on page 51 of the Report :-(i) With regard to the Royal Commission&apos;s first proposal,  the Committee recommend that a person, who is habitually employed in ins-arable employment on not more than two days of the week shall be -(a) entitled to a certificate for exemption:(b) disqualified for the receipt of unemployment benefit.Any question arising under this provision shall be decided., in the first instance, by an insurance officer with the same right of appeal to a Court of Referees and the Umpire, as in the case of a claim for benefit.(ii)The Royal Commission&apos;s second proposal relating to casual workers and short time workers in receipt of high earnings should, in the view of the Committee, be accepted in. principle, and a clause should be drafted giving effect to it, if a workable scheme can be devised,(iii)The Royal Commission&apos;s third proposal relating to married women should,  the Committee recommend., be adopted in principle as a purely interim measure.(iv) The Royal Commission&apos;s fourth proposal, relating to s easonal workers, should be adopted substantially in the form given, on page 51 of the Reports21. If the Cabinet approve the Committee&apos;s recommend-ations,  it is suggested that the Committee should remain in being for purposes such as the examination, of the draft Bill to give effect to the recommendations,,Signed cn behalf of the Committee ARTHUR HENDERSON Chairman.;,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,1. 9th Jume, 1931.
