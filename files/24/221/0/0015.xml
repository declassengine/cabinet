A serious political situation hejs been caused by the agreement arrived at between the German and Austrian Governments to negotiate a customs union.     As a purely economic proposition we would have no objection to and might indeed welcome such a customs union provided that it was complete and effective.     But in the present case the political issues involved are so seriously far-reaching that the question must be considered primarily from the political point of view.A political union between Germany and Austria is forbidden except with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations (which in the present circumstances would certainly not be given).     Any economic union between Austria and another country must be subject to the con-ditions laid down in the Protocol concluded in 1922 between Great Britain, France, Italy and Czechoslovakia on the one hand and Austria on the other when under the aegis of the League of Nations a reconstruction loan was granted to Austria.     By this Protocol Austria undertakes not to conclude any &quot;special regime or exclusive advantages calculated to threaten Austria&apos;s economic independence&quot;.1 Although there would seem to be no question of the present&quot;Austro-German agreement infringing the Treaty of Versailles, it is open to grave doubt whether this agree-mentJMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the Agreement reached &quot;by Germany and Austria to conclude a Customs Union.
agreement doss not- run counter to the obligations assumed &quot;by Austria under the Protocol of 19220Ostensibly the reason why the Gorman and Austrian Governments desire a customs union is in order to rescue Austria from imminent economic collaose.    The Gorman Government in particular, however, have been suspected in many quarters in Europe of having been inspired by the following ulterior political motives:-(a) By establishing an economic union with Austria they hope to take the first step towards a political union0(b) They hope by putting forward this highly contentious scheme to awaken the European Governments to the necessity of really confronting the problem of the economic reform and reorganisation of Europe which has been the subject of desultory and ineffective discussions at Geneva during the last three years.(c) If no alternative is offered and at the same time the ex-allied Governments prevent by legal means the Austro-German customs union from materialising, the German Government hope to use this fact as an argument to show that whenever they attempt to improve Germany&apos;s national economic position and extend her markets, they are at once thwarted, and that therefore the whole question of repara-tions must be reopened,(d) The Brunning Government hoped&quot;to strengthen their position with Germany by a forward foreign policy.Prance and Czechoslovakia are the two countries who are chiefly concerned to prevent at all costs the con-elusion of the proposed customs union.     Both of them fear it because
(I)   they see in it a first step towards a political union;(2)   the agrarian countries in Eastern Europe might he forced to accede to it and thereby prepare the way for Germany1s political domination in Central and South-Eastern Europe;   and(3)   &quot;both for geographical and economic reasons Czechoslovakia would probably be starved into acceding to the union and thereby endangering her national independence,I think it is clear from the above analysis of the political situation created by the Austro-German proposal that if it is allowed to materialise in its present form-it is capable, owing to the fears and suspicions ib has aroused, of endangering the whole policy of European co-operation and disarmament which it is the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government to promote..    For this reason means must, in my opinion, be found for removing the proposal from the domain of international politics.     But this ought to be effected, not by the imposition of a direct veto, but by some gentler method which will save the faces of these directly concerned and not perpetuate the bitter-ness already generated0As soon as I heard of the Austro-German agreement, I proposed, in order to gain time and to get the question under proper control, that the subject should be placed on the agenda of the forthcoming mooting of the League Council who could then, if necessary, consult the Hague Court as to whether the contemplated union would constitute a violation of the Protocol of 1922.     I realise, however, that a merely legal decision, even though given by the
Hague Court, is not by itself going to solve :the problem which has been created.     An inconclusive decision will settle nothing.     A decision in favour of the union would lead France and Czechoslovakia to adopt the most violent end dangerous counter-measures for tho defence of their political interests to the detriment of the whole policy of European co-operation and disarmament.     Lastly, a decision condemning the union without any substitute being offered would leave Germany and Austria with a bitter grievance which, as pointed out above, Germany would exploit on every possible occasion for political ends.     It might also lead to the fall of the German Government and a revival of Hitlerism.It would of course be possible to allow matters to run their course in the hope that when it came to the point there would be so many practical difficulties in the way that Austria and Germany would never be able to agree on a real union.     (It Is known that there is alreadv consider-able objection in certain political and industrial circles in Austria to the idea of a union.)     Also the German and Austrian Governments have said that other Governments would be free to join the Austro-German customs union.     The Germans and Austrians might be taken at their word and we might demand that the question of the entry of other States Into the union should be examined before any further progress is made with the direct negotiations between Germany and Austria.     If this course were adopted, the whole scheme of an extended customs union might break down under its own weight and after months of futile discussion this failure would give both Germany and Austria the opportunity of saving
saving their laces and abandoning the whole idea of a custom union without being accused by their public opinion of yielding to British or French pressure.But at the best this is a risky and ungrateful policy. We may eventually have to come to it but to begin with at an rate I should much prefer to adopt a more constructive cours by co-operating with the whole body of European Governments in elaborating some economic solution which both France and Germany would be able to accept as an adequate alternative to the customs union, and which would at- the same time represent some definite progress in the direction of that economic co-operation and &quot;disarmament&quot; between the various European Shates towards which we have been striving in vain for so longo     My intention, therefore^ is to start off at any rate by offering my services as honest broker between France and Germany without committing &quot;myself to either, and thereby to use the present opportunity to advance the cause of economic co-operatj.cn between nations.     With this object in view I shs.ll try at Geneva, to arrange for the question of the customs union to be dealt with primarily as an economic rather than as a juridical or even political problem, and shall advocate the creation of one or more special technical committees which shall be authorised to examine alternative schemes to take the place of the proposed union.Germany has already placed the question on the agenda of the Commission of Enquiry for European Union which meets two days before -the League Council, but I do not yet knotf what line the German representative will be instructed to take.     I have told the Gorman Ambassador that I shall be glad to bo enlightened on this point.
Meanwhile the French and Czechoslovak Governments are. going to put forward a proposal on the following lines:-(a) In order to prevent the agrarian countries of Eastern Europe from being drawn into the Austro-German orbit, the chief grain-Importing countrr s of Europe (excluding Great Britain) should (withoutv It is hoped, their asking for any quid pro quo) grant a tariff reduction on importsup to a stipulated quota to the agrarian countries (excluding Russia) such as would enable them to dispose of their present grain surplus.     In order that this preference should not encourage over production in the agrarian States, consortia should be created both in the importing end exporting States in order to regulate the production of trades in cereals.     The grain-producing countries-outside Europe should be asked not to claim a similar preference in virtue of their most-favoured--nation treatments(b) In order to assist Austria in her economic distresss which presumably had driven her into the arms of Germany, the European States generally should grant a preference to specific Austrian goods in the form both ofa quota and tariff reduction- The countries enjoying most-favour od-nat ion treatment, including Great Britain, would be asked, in view of the special circumstances, to forego their rights o(c) As regards tariff reductions the French scheme contemplates the extension of the system of international cartels as being a more promising line of approval than the proposals hitherto made for a flat reduction covering all goods.(d) The French scheme provides for the creation of an international agricultural credit organisation under the League of Nations, in which French banks would co-operate.Meanwhile other tentative schemes have already beenL suggested
suggest3d and it will be the work ox the technical committees which I have in mind to scrutinise one and all of them, with a view to elaborating a generally acceptable scheme which will serve as an alternative to the proposed customs union. The other schemes which have been suggested up to dateare: -(1)     AXLJinof f icial. Britj-Sh^suj^stijm, In order to satisfy German and Austrian demands for larger foreign markets, there should be an agreement among the protectionist countries to reduce their tariffs by 25%, Great Britain would join in this agreement by undertaking for a fixed period, say three years, not., to alter her present tariff system.     The protectionist countries which declined to enter the agreement; i,e., declined to redo.ee their tariffs. would not be entitled to enjoy the benefits of reduction by other countries notwithstanding their most-favoured-nation rights,(2)     A B,elgiari,^nn^oXThe Government concerned should take as basis the procedure laid down in the Final Act of the Economic Conference (November 1930) whereby Governments were en-couraged to negotiate bilateral agreements for the mutual reduction of tariffs.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have already taken action in this sense and negotiations areproceedingy
proceeding between Great Britain and seven other countries.     A concerted effort should now he made to extend and hasten these hilateral negotiations so as to include as many countries as possible, and especially Prance, Germany and Italy.    The resultant bilateral agreements should then be consolidated into a collective Convention.    It is hoped that world-wide economic pressure, combined with the shock caused by the proposed Austro-German union, would lead many countries to be more forthcoming than would otherwise be the case.     If the results were successful it would, like scheme No. (1), secure to both Germany and Austria that extension of their foreign markets which they require.
Against all these schemes opposition can be raised both on general grounds and from the point of view of British interests and perhaps of British tariff policy. The same, no doubt, is true of any possible combination of the above schemes or of any other alternative economic solution of the present European difficulty that may be put forward.     Without going into a detailed analysis, the Cabinet will no doubt desire to lay it down that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom could not be a party to any international agreement in which we were under any obligation to discriminate in the matter of customs duties in favour of countries who are parties to such a union and against parties who are outside it.     But starting from this basis it may be said that any such schemes as those outlined above may in one v/ay or another raise the following questions of policy:(A).     &quot;here it is proposed to apply a preferential tariff to meet the present grave politico-economic emergency, we ought, for reasons of high policy, without abandoning our adherence to the principle of most-favoured-nation treatment, to be willing to introduce a certain elasticity into our interpretation of it, thus:(i)    If in a multilateral agreement for tariff reduc-tion the continental signatories desire to adopt the   new interpretation2- of most-favoured-nation treatment giventwo/x.     This new interpretation would permit signatories of general conventions for tariff reduction or removal of other obstacles-to international trade to refuse the benefits of such, conventions to non-signatory states provided the con-ventions are open to any states which will accept its terms.f
two years ago by the Economic Committee, ought we not to agree to allow them to do sof provided the benefit of their tariff reductions is extended to Great Britain in virtue of our liberal regime?(ii)   It is conceivable that circumstances might arise in which we should be faced with the demand to give up for a specific purpose ecg0 assistance to Austria and within certain limits our most-favoured-nation treatment.(B)    If continental governments are prepared to make a multilateral agreement for tariffs reduction based on the new Interpretation of most-favoured-nation treat-ment, should His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United King-dom secure for Great Britain the advantages of the tariff reductions which that agreement might mean, although the Dominions are not also willing to adhere?   (It is of course understood that no such agreement could in any way affect the present tariff relations between Great Britain and the Dominions).(C).     If in the negotiation of.an agreement of the kind above described for the general   reduction of tariffs the continental governments request uss as our contribu-tion to -that end, to agree not to put on protective duties for a fixed period of time, shall His Majestyfs Government-in the United Kingdom agree to do so, provided the advantage to be obtained from the reduction in tariffs is substantial?It must be recognised that if we cannot give an under-taking of this kind, we shall, rightly or wrongly, be held responsible/
responsible for making a general system of tariff reduction impossible.If Great Britain is to use the present opportunity to co-operate in building up some measure of European economic union, she will be required to make certain sacrifices, otherwise she runs the risk of being held responsible for having brought to nought the joint efforts of Europe to replace the dangerous Austro-German customs union by some progressive scheme for the economic union of Europe.As the President of the Board of Trade will be unable to go to Geneva to take part in the important discussions which are impending I hope therefore that on the questions of policy enumerated above I may be given a sufficiently free hand -to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to contribute to the common work of removing the political danger which has been created by the proposal to set up an Austro-German customs union.f -r--.....
