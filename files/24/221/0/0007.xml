and in particular to the following points set out on pages 2 and 3 of the Conclusions in question:-&apos;(a) The question of price.    It was suggested that5  in so far as the Quota tended to limit the freedom of the millers to &quot;buy their wheat from any source,  the effect would be to raise somewhat the price which they would have to pay for Dominion wheat. On the other hand,  it was argued that,  since under the Quota the United Kingdom would only absorb about a quarter of the exportable wheat surplus of the Dominions, the pressure of competition In other markets, would keep the price the millers had to pay for Dominion wheat at the world price;    the Dominions had expected that they would gain no price ad-vantage but they attached importance, possibly an undue importances to having an assured market at world prices for a certain quantity of their wheat.    The suggestion was made thats  in that.case, more harm than good might be caused in the long run,  when the Dominions came to realise that the scheme had not been ac beneficial to them as they had expected,(b)  Commercial treaties with foreign countries It was pointed out that an advantage of the scheme was that it did not in any way affect our commercial treaties with foreign countries(o) The maohinerrf for administering the Quota. It was pointed out that the expense of this would fall on the United Kingdom-(rl)  The effect of adopting a Dominion Qxiotaupon the proposal for a United Kingdom Quota.(e) The question of bargaining with the Dominions.

1, With reference to . the Conclusion at their- 3rdMeeting, when the Committee agreed to defer consideration, &quot;of the proposals respecting a Dominion Quota until the Agricultural Development Committee had reported &quot;on the Home aspects of the matter, the Committee, In pursuance of Cabinet 23 (31) Conclusion 1 (e), that they should examine the proposed Dominion Wheat Quota, wlthmrt prejudice to the question of the Home Wheat Quota,  resumed their consideratic of a Dominion Wheat Quota.      In this connection the Committee had &quot;before them the fc-llr/wing documents relating to .this subject  ; -report of the. Committee on Economic Co-operation of the Tmperxal Confer en ce , -1930 &quot; &apos;&apos;(E;-E.(30)&quot; S&amp;&quot;  -    Section I)    .Memorandum, &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (0*C*(30) 7)  covering draft heads of Home and Dominion Wheat Quota Bill, and explanatory memorandum thereon (.0.C.(30)  9)   and (0.0.

(SO) 17).THE SECRETARY -OP STATS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS, opening the discussion.,.,, recalled..the circumstances in which thesuggestion of - a--quota&quot;&quot;f or- Dominion wheat had-beer, discussed at the Imperial Conference.. He said that this suggestion had been put forward for discussion by the United Kingdom delegates as an alternative to the Doininion proposal of tariffs^    The Dominion- delegates had at first been-inelineii to brush the suggestion on one side, but oh examination of the scheme they had become more and more attracted by it. In the end the position of the United Kingdom delegates, who were not in&apos;a position to acoept the scheme without further examination; had become difficultc    The Conference had finally agreed that the United, Kingdom Government
should examine the matter further with a view to the further discussion cf the scheme at the proposed Ottawa ConferenceoMra Thomas thought that the V/heat Quota was the one constructive scheme of importance which the United Kingdom could put forward afOttawa.      He was of cpinion that, unless the United Kingdom delegates to Ottawa were able to put forward the scheme as accepted in principle &quot;by the United Kingdom Government, the proposed Conference at Ottawa would do more harm than good.A general discussion followed in the course ofwhich it was agreed that the attention of the cabinet should be drawn to the following points -(a) The question of prices    It was suggested that 5 in so far as the Quota tended to limit the freedom of the millers to buy their wheat from any source, the effect would be to raise somewhat the price which they would have to pay for Dominion wheat. On the other hand it was argued that, since under the Quota the United Kingdom would only absorb about a quarter of the exportable wheat surplus of the Dominions7  the pressure cf competition in other markets would keep the price the millers had to pay for Dominion wheat at the world price;    the Dominions had expected that they would gain no price ad-vantage but they attached importance, possibly an undue importance, to having an assured market at world prices fcr a certain quantity of their v/heat.    The suggestion was made that,  in that case, mere harm than good might be caused in the long run, when the Dominions  came to realise fiat the scheme had not been asbeneficial  to them as they had expected,,(b) Commercial treaties with foreign countries. It was pointed cut that an advantage of the scheme was that it did not in any way affect our commercial treaties with foreign ccuntr&amp;e-r(c) The machinery for administering the Quota,, &apos;lt was pointed c-\it that the
expense of fhis would fall on the United Kingdom*(d) The effect of adopting a Dominion quota upon the proposal for a United Kingdom duo ta o(e) The question of&apos; bargaining Tgith- the Dom&quot;iniops0    It was tEe general view of the Committee that it was undesirable that the Quota scheme or any other proposals for the benefit of the Dominions that might be advanced, by the United Kingdom should be used as bargaining counters0      Such proposals should be put forward as the United Kingdom&apos;s contributions to  the principle of inter-Imperial Economic Co-operation in the expectation that the. Dominions would make their contributions to the common pool.The Committee? by a majority, agreed to commend the Cabinet0(l) That the United Kingdom delegates to the Ottawa Conference be empowered to put forward the proposal of a Quota for Dominion wheat milled in the United Kingdom as part of any general scheme for inter-Imperial Economic Co-operation which may emerge from the Conference0(S) That pending a decision of the Cabineton (l) above3 consultation with the millers on the method of operating the scheme should be deferredo
fiSINAEION OP     2o With reference to O.C. (30) 1st Conclusions,ADS STATISTICS. ,DOMIKEQN        Minute 3, the Committee had &quot;before then a Note &quot;by Sir RIFFS.Sydney Chapman (0.0.(30)  13)  stating that the examination into the Newf ounjlland Tariff had n*w been completed, and a list prepared 9f headings of the Newfoundland Customs Tariff in regard tn which, so far as can &quot;be judged, the grant of a preference would be most likely to help United Kingdom exports, and that it (was proposed, in accordance with the authority given at the Committee&apos;s first meeting,  shortly to consult the trade organisations concerned with regard to these suggestions.    It was anticipated that suggestions on similar lines as to the articles specified in the Customs Tariffs of other Dominions in respect of which increased -preferences would be of the greatest service to eur trade would be completed within tho next few weeks,  and that after the trade organisations had been consulted, final lists of the tariff concessions to be sought at. Ottawa... from each of the Dominions, would be available The Committee agreed :-(1) That the United Kingdom Delegates to the Ottawa Conference should endeavour to secure increased margins between the general and preferential rates of duty by reductions in the preferential rates rather than by increases in the &quot;general rates,  and that in no circumstances should the United Kingdom Delegates specifically advocate a policy of increased&apos; rates In the general duties0.(2)  That the documents referred to in *0.(50)  18 should be circulated to the Committee in due course,and noted that(3)    The Eoaro. of Trade were proceeding with the discussions with, the trade interests concerned.,
3. With reference to 0.0.(30) 1st Conclusions,MliJmrte 2(c),  the Committee had before them an Interim--&quot;Report of the Intar-d^partmcn-tal Preparatory Committee on Overseas Empire Canned Fruit and Canned Pish (O.C.(30)  20),      Reference was made to the proposals eorrtained. in the Committee * r, Interim Report (CP. 69(31)) relative to   a    special propaganda campaign in the United Kingdom for Empire butter,and  assistance in the organisation of centralised marketing of Empire butter -without further necessary cost to the Exchequer.    The recommendations ofthe Committeein regard to these matters had been approved by the Cabinet on the 13th March last (Cabinet 18 (31) Conclusion 0(a)) on the clear understanding that the Cabinet were in no way committed to acceptance in principle of any of the proposals affecting butter. The Cabinet also invited the Committee to bear carefully in mind the interests of the home consumer.The Inter-Departmental Committee now ashed&apos; for authority to consult with representatives of producers and importers of oversea   Empire canned fruit and canned fish generally on the lineo authorised in respect of butter., in regard to a propaganda campaign In the United Kingdom,  and assistance in the organisation of centralised marketing of these commodities.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointed out that while the cost of the proposed special propaganda campaigns in favour of oversea Empire products was to be borne mainly by public funds,  the arrangements under the Agricultural Marketing Bill contemplated that each trade would bear the expense of Its own propaganda for the better marketing- of the home products.      This
would inevitably be criticised as unfair to theUnited Kingdom producer.The Committee agreed:-(l) Subject to (2) below that the Inter-Departmental Committee should have authority to consult with representatives of producers and importers of overseas Empire canned fruit and canned fish, and also if they thought fit with tbe representatives of producers and importers of other oversea    Empire products,  generally on the lines authorised in respect of butter,  in . regard to (a) propaganda campaigns in the United Kingdom,  and (b)  assistance in the organisation of centralised marketing of these commodities.(2)    That action under (l) above should,however, be stayed until the Agricultural Marketing Bill had   passed through the House of Commons.for Dominion Affairs covering a brief note of an informal conversation which he had recently had with representatives of the Federation of British Industries and the Trades Union Congress on the subject oi a  joint memorandum submitted by those Bodies to the Prime Minister ini September last in regard to Inter-Imperial trade, Inter-Imperial Secretariat,  etc.      It was clear from this discussion that neither of the Bodies in question had any real idea of the political difficulties which are encountered in discussing these matters with the Dominions and with a view to enlisting the help of the Federation of British Industries and the Trades Union Congress in the development of an informed public opinion in the country on the subject the appointment had been suggested of a sign OF 4, The CommitteIMPERIAL.EEG QUESTIONS ^Memorandum (O.C,(30)Committee had under22) by the Secretary of Stconsideration a
standing Sub-Committee of the Economic Advisory Council at -which representatives of employers and employees would meet periodically with Ministers and officials to discuss the position with regard to any proposals in the sphere of Inter-Imperial economic relations whichwere under consideration by the Government here or the subject of negotiations between the Governments of the Commonwealth.      Such a Committee need not, however;, he thought, necessarily or even probably furnish any reports as to its deliberations.Doubts were expressed whether in view of the fact that the Economic Advisory Council waa established to advise the Government on economic matters, it would be an appropriate body to undertake the functions contemplated in O.C.(30) 22, and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs undertook to give further c ins id-r \t ion to thp mutter.50 The Committee had before them a Noteby the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs covering a cojjy of a letter in regard to the representation of Southern Rhodesia at the ottawa ConCorence which had been cent by SirEoJ,Harding to the High Commissioner for the United .Kingdom in ganada,  together with-a Note&apos;car . fee&quot;position of Southern Rhodesia at Imperial Cen^erpgno-as-mentioned in that letter.The Committee agreed-, -To approve the proposed arrangements for the representation etc.  of Southern Rhodesia at the Ottawa Conference set out in Sir E.J.Harding&apos;s letter of 17th April,  1931.H1SSNTATI0N OP THERN RHODESIA THE OTTAWA 3ERENCE,
