These amendmentsinvolve modifications in the instructions  to the UnitedKingdom Delegation which had been approved at an earlierMeeting (Cabinet 29  (50),  Conclusion E).2C One of the objects of the amendments approved bythe Cabinet was to ensure that Commissioners appointedby the League to verify that the Council&apos;s instructions have been Carried out as to withdrawal of forces from certain zones/should notbe admitted to a war harbour or on board ships detailedfor important naval operations, since,  if this were permitted,  there would be a great risk of leakage ofinformation as to naval dispositions and,  inferentially,plans o
3. The Admiralty, however, were not satisfied that the further discussions on the Model Treaty at Geneva in October,  1930, had resulted in adequate safeguards in this respect,  and raised the question again at the last Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,. The Committee recommended,  accordingly, that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should arrange for a jjonf er-once between the three Service Ministers, their Chiefs of Staff, and Lord Cecil, with a view to re-examining the question, and,  if necessary, putting forward definite recommendations.    The meeting was held on March 30,  1931.4. The purport of the arrangements now proposed maybe summed up as follows.;-The Admiralty, while not wishing to oppose any reasonable action which the League ma;/ recommend in order to satisfy themselves that their requests have been implemented under the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Model Treaty, were apprehensive lest any such action could be interpreted as giving liberty of inspection of Naval Ports, Dockyards or establishments .    Such a provision might, in the Admiralty&apos;s opinion, be detrimental to national security.    The Admiralty were assured at the confer-ence that their apprehensions were groundless and that no such right of inspection was either meant or intended: in order that no doubts could possibly arise, however, a proviso to Article 3, Proposal B, has been drawn up by Lord Cecil, in consultation with the Admiralty and the Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office, which Is set forth in paragraph II of the Appendix to this Note.   This proviso makes It clear that any action taken must be specifically limited, to satisfying the League that any withdrawal of instruc-tions has been carried out.50 I am directed by the Prime Minister to ask theCabinet to approve Lord Cecil1 s draft as set forth inparagraph II of the Appendix, which involves a further amendment to the instructions previously approved bythe Cabinet .
6 . A small point was raised by the Air Ministry as to whether the phrase &quot;threat to invade&quot;,  in Proposal Bo of Article 2, could be held to cover movements of aircraft.    It was pointed out, for example, that we might desire to reinforce the Worth-West Frontier of India from Iraq under certain circumstances,  and that it might be definitely prejudicial to the interests of national security if the League had authority to construe such an action as a threat to invade and to request that no movement be made.    lb was agreed, however,  that in point of fact sufficient safeguards did exist in the Treaty as now drafted,, and that, &apos;since aircraft could, in practice, invade other territory from bases so far behind their frontiers,  it would be impossible for the League, save in exceptional circumstances^ to issue any such instructionso(Signed) M.PoA.
