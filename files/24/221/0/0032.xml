8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT. llC RET CABINET.IP.132(51) . Copy No.SROAD TRAFFIC ACT. 1930. CONVEYANCE OF PASSENGERS IN LORRIES. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport.Subsection (3) of Section 61 of the Road Traffic Actreads as follows:-&quot;(3) Where a person uses or allows to be used without reward for carrying eight or more persons as passengers any motor vehicle ordinarily used for the purposes of agriculture, trade or business, then, except where the persons so carried are workpeople being carried in the course of or to or from their employment, the vehicle shall for the purposes of this Part of this Act be treated as if it was a contract carriage, and the provisions of this Part of this Act and the regulations made thereunder shall apply accordingly&quot;.The provisions of this subsection bring within the definition of &quot;contract carriage&quot; any vehicle which is used forcarrying eight or more passengers (except workpeople conveyed inthe course of, or to or from their employment) even though nocharge is made for their conveyance.     This rules out the use oflorries for such purposes as the conveyance of cricket and footballteams, school treats, work peoples&apos; outings, etc.&apos;, as it is *;impossible for vehicles of the lorry type to comply with theconstructional conditions (imposed   by regulation) which arenecessary for them to obtain licences as public service vehicles.The subsection is based on a recommendation of theDepartmental Committee on the Licensing and Regulation of PublicService Vehicles.     The Draft Road Traffic Bill, circulated by my predecessor for discussion in 1927, contained a subclause almostidentical with that which is now in the Act.     The RoyalCommission on Transport accepted the subclause without comment.No comment was made on the subclause during theproceedings on the Road Traffic Bill in the House of Lords.
In the House of Commons the subclause was debated in Standing Committee C on an amendment moved by Mr. Remer to exempt vehicles which were carrying without charge members of a football, hockey, cricket or other sports team.     The amendment was negatived by the Committee without a division and practically without discussion.     The matter was not raised again during the remaining stages of the Bill.From the number of letters which have recently been received in the Ministry it would seem that this practice has been much more common and. widespread than was thought to be the case, and pleas have been received for an amendment of the Act so as to allow lorries to be used for free conveyance in the case of Sunday school treats, employees&apos; outings, cricket, football and other sports teams, Boy Scouts&apos; and Girl Guides&apos; camps, disabled men, collectors for charitable institutions, etc.On the 12th May I received a representative deputation from the National Playing Fields Association, which included members of all three political parties.     They made a strong point of the hardships which this provision of the Act was likely to inflict, particularly in country villages, and they stated that their request was supported by a number of bodies interested in the organisation of sports, outings and camps for children and young peopleOne of the strongest points which has been made by some of those who have written to me on the subject is that many of these outings have to take place on public holidays and that oh such occasions it is impossible to obtain the use of proper vehicles (such as omnibuses and motor coaches) as
they are already hooked up or can only &quot;be hired at prohibitive prices, whereas goods vehicles are standing idle.It must be admitted that under the conditions laid down in the Act a number of outings, etc., which have taken place regularly in the past will have to cease, but on the other hand the safety of the persons carried in these vehicles must not be lost sight of.      The whole scheme of public service vehicle licences under Part IV of the Act is designed to secure the safety of passengers carried in motor vehicles and the provisions of the sub-section were framed with this end in view.      It hardly seems defensible to take elaborate precautions to ensure the safety of adults carried in motor coaches or omnibuses and then waive those precautions in the case of children (sometimes crippled and blind) whom it is proposed to carry in unsuitable vehicles, simply because no payment is made for the use of the vehicle.The use of an ordinary lorry fitted with loose chairs or forms for carrying a considerable number of passengers must involve seme element of danger, and on such grounds is undesirable.     A vehicle of this kind is not subject to the special requirements, which apply to public service vehicles, for minimising the risk of fire or for ensuring stability.      It is under no form of inspection, its brakes or steering control may be defective, and it may be dangerous in other respects owing to faulty maintenance. Further the driver of a lorry may be subject to no form of control or supervision.
- k- -The records of accidents in my Department are far from complete, hut several cases have &quot;been recorded in recent years where passengers in lorries have fallen out, or have been thrown out when the lorry swerved or overturned.     Happily, there has been no recent accident recorded in the case of children.I am not greatly impressed with the arguments which have been used with regard to cricket and football teams.     The Act would permit of seven persons being conveyed in a lorry, with the necessary equipment for the game, and the rest would usually be able to make their way to the ground by cycle or some other means.      But the case as regards&apos;children&apos;s or employees&apos;  camps, outings, etc., has a much stronger general appeal, and I feel bound to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that political pressure from members of our own party, as well as from the opposition, is being brought to bear on me in favour of the repeal or modification of the subsection.An amendment has been put down to the Finance Bill in the names of Sir Thomas Inskip and others providing that a lorry used for the conveyance of passengers without reward need not obtain a public service vehicle licence, but that when a vehicle is so used for the conveyance of children, a certificate counter-signed by a magistrate shall be required.      It may be taken for granted, I think, that this amendment will be ruled out of order.     The suggestion that a magistrate should be required to sign a certificate whenever children are to be conveyed in lorries is, difficult to accept, as it would be unreasonable to expect magistrates to assume such a responsibility in the absence of proper technical inspection and advice, and undesirable to impose such a responsibility on them.
If the subsection were repealed, it would mean that, so long as no payment was made for the use of the vehicle, any number of persons   could he carried for any purpose, such as to see a our Final or for a beanfeast in a vehicle which would not be subject to any form of control as to its condition or safety, or as to the competence of the driver.Public sentiment, so far as it is being expressed at the moment, has fastened on the hardships imposed on those who can no longer avail themselves of the facilities of free conveyance in a lorry, but it only needs one serious accident to occur in such circumstances and the Government will be blamed for allowing it to come about.I am advised that under the provisions of the Act the difficulty could not adequately be met by regulation,     Even if it were possible to relax the requirements in respect of contract carriages to such an extent as to permit of the use of lorries for the conveyance of passengers, it would still be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to obtain a certificate of fitness and a public service vehicle licence.     Apart from administrative difficulties, this course would be undesirable as it would place upon the Certifying Officers and Public Service Vehicle Examiners the responsibility of passing lorries as fit for use for the conveyance of pas serge re after possibly only a cursory examination.In these circumstances I am forced to ask my colleagues to decide whether:-(l)    to leave the position as it is under the provisions of the Actj    or(2)    to give facilities for legislation amending orrepealing subsection (3) of section 6l of the Road Traffic Act.
In the second alternative it might he possible merely to amend the subsection by raising the maximum number of persons who could be carried, without involving the necessity of licensing the vehicle as a contract carriage, from seven to (say) fourteen.      This would meet the case of cricket or football teams, but would not go far enough to meet the needs of sunday school treats, employees  outings, etc., where as many as 20 or JO persons are often carried in a single lorry.Again it might be possible to enact in an amending Bill that the driver or other responsible person conveyed on the lorry should   carry a written statement signed by or on behalf of the owner of the vehicle to the effect that the vehicle was being used on that occasion without reward, that it was in effecient working order and was reasonably safe for the conveyance of passengers.Neither of these last two suggestions is really satisfactory and if there is to be any amending legislation it can probably best take the form of a simple repeal of the subsection.Should the Cabinet decide that amending legislation is necessary I would suggest that a short Bill strictly limited to the point in question should be introduced as soon as possible in the House of Lords,  and that if passed by that House facilities should be given for consideration in the Commons on the definite understanding that the Bill could not be proceeded with if Members tried to use it as an opportunity of taking up the time of the House with amendments.On merits   the law as it stands is, in my view, rights the question is really one of political expediency.(Initialled)   H.M.28th May. 1951*
