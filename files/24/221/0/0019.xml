Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.hP. 119 SMlI have to submit to. my colleagues the necessity which has arisen of financial assistance for the Government of the Colony of Mauritius, and the proposals which I have agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer for giving that assistance.2.     Mauritius was visited on March 5th-8th by the most severe hurricane from which the island has suffered for a generation.   Widespread damage to buildings and property, and much immediate distress, was caused.   A large number of small dwellings were demolished and several thousands rendered homeless.   While damage to larger buildings was generally less severe, a hospital was badly damaged, and extensive damage was done to estate buildings and plant.   Roads and bridges also suffered severely from floods.    In addition, a substantial propor-tion, estimated at 30%,  of the growing sugar crop, was- destroyed.This document is the nrpjjertxJ^f^L^^ Government opiM-for. the Cabinet.

destroyed.   This loss was the most serious blow, as the sugar crop is the mainstay of the island,  sugar forming 98% of its exports.       Coming at the end of a long period of depression in the sugar industry, during which the producers&apos; reserves have been exhausted, and bearing in mind the shock to confidence, it was doubtful whether the community would be able to meet its hurricane losses, estimated in all at  675,000, without the help of fee Government.3.     Before the hurricane the financial position of the Colonial Government itself had been a subject of anxiety to me.   Briefly, the Government has,  as a result of the long-continued depression in the sugar industry, exhausted in the last 5 years the surplus balances built up, with commendable foresight,  in the preceding period of prosperity in the industry.    In the current financial year, ending on the 30th of June, 1931, there is a prospective deficit estimated at approximately Rs. 2, 800, 000 ( 210,. 000) to which must be added the deficit on the working of the Government Railways,, estimated at Rs.1,000, 000 ( 75,000).    It is anticipated that the whole of the available surplus balances will be needed to meet these deficits, and it is possible that they may prove insufficient.   There is a prospect of further deficits in 1931/32 and -the Governor has indicated his opinion that they cannot be avoided by any ordinary economies in expenditure, or incroases in revenue.4.     In these circumstances it appeared clear that the Colonial Government was in no position to meet thecost
cost of repairs and replacement of its property (estimated at Rs.1,000, 000 ( 75,000) or   to render assistance to the general community:   Actual immediate distress is being met from local funds (including a special relief fund to which contributions have been made by the Colonial Government and the Government of Madagascar) but for any real rehabilitation of the economic life of the Colony it appeared clear that His majesty&apos;s Government must come to the assistance of the Colonial Government.   With the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the following assistance was therefore offered to the Governor, on the &quot;conditions indicated:-1.   An immediate free gift of  5,000 in aid of the relief of actual distress to he made by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2.     His Majesty1 .b Government to guarantee the interest and. sinking fund payments of a loan to be raised by the Government of Mauritius to cover the cost of:-(a) repair and replacement of Government property damaged in the hurricane;(b) loans to private persons and companies up to the amount of the losses due to the hurricane by way of damage to property,  stock, etc. and loss of growing crops.(c) public works which cannot be financed   in any other way.The conditions were(i)   The Colonial Government to consent to an investigation of its financial position by a Financial Commission to be appointed by His Majesty1s Government with a view to devisingmeasures
measures to produce a balanced budget at the earliest possible date, (ii) As regards 2(b) above,  the loans to be for aperiod of years to be fixed in the circumstances of each case subject to a maximum;    to be constituted by law first liens on the properties involved;   and to be assessed with reference to the anraunt of hurricane damage and the borrowers own ability to bear the loss. 5.     This offer of assistance, with slight modifica-tions of the conditions proposed, has been gratefully excepted by the Colonial G-overnment, and the Governor informed me on the 23rd of April that the Council of Government had pa,ssed a Resolution agreeing to the appoint ment of the proposed Financial Commission.6.     is a result of further correspondence with the Governor it appear a&apos;that it may not be necessary to make advances to private persons up to the full amount of their hurricane losses as originally estimated and it is now considered that the sum to   be raised by loan for all three purposes need not exceed  750,000.     It is proposed to ask Parliament to authorise the Treasury to guarantee a loan of not more than this amount   to be raised by the Government of Mauritius,   subject to the usual conditions   on the lines of the Palestine and East Africa Loans Act, 1926.   As, however, there is a real danger that, even with the adoption of the most stringent economy measures,  it may not be practicable to balance the budget immediately,  it is necessary to contemplate that
that Exchequer   assistance may be required for the first few years to enable the Colony to provide for the service of the loan.    It is accordingly proposed to   provide in the Bill for this assistance for a limited period (not exceeding five years).       It is desirable that the loan should be raised before August, and, therefore, that the necessary Act should-be passed at the latest by the middle af July.    It is accordingly proposed to take the necessary Money Resolution immediately after Whitsun.7.     I have every hope that these measures of assistance will succeed in placing Mauritius once more in a sound position and that no other effective measures would be so economical for His Majesty&apos;s Government. Steps are being taken for the early appointment^of the proposed Financial Commission which is to devise measures to balance the Colony&apos;s budget.   The sugar industry of the Colony, although at present suffering from the. world depression,  is efficiently managed, as demonstrated by the Report of the late Sir F. Watts last year, and I am confident that it will survive if the effects of this natural catastrophe can be mitigated.   On theoccasion of the last comparable disaster in Mauritius, the ,even more disastrous hurricane of 1892, His Majesty&apos;s Government also lent assistance by guaranteeing a loan, a large part of which was advanced to planters.     The whole of those advances have been repaid, and His Majesty&apos; s Government have never been called upon to implement
/implement their guarantee.   Once the present difficulties are over,  I am confident that the people of Mauritius will do everything in their power to secure that the same will be the case with the present loan.8.     I request the approval of my colleagues for these proposals, which have been agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.P.COLONIAL OFFICE.11th May,  1931,
