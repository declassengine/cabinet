THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off 1MB BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SBaBBE. COPY   NO...CP, 18.1 (51)HOURS    OP    INDUSTRIAL    EMPLOYMENT    BIIiL.NOTE    BY    THE    MINISTER    OF    LABOUR.1.      Immediately on the Government taking office in June, 1929 the prime Minister sent a telegram to the International Labour Conference then sitting promising whole-hearted co-operation with the Organisation.      On instructions from the Government the following statement was made to the full conference by the Government Delegate: &quot;I am authorised to state that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Great Britain propose to take the necessary steps to ensure at the earliest possible moment the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention. That statement requires no further explanation and would only suffer at this moment by further elabora-tion.    I should, however,  add that I understand that in introducing the Hours legislation necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government will take account both of the &quot;Washington Convention and the London Agreement. 11 2,      The statement was repeated in the House of Commons on 4th July,  1929, in reply to a question.
3.      During 1929-30 a series of discussions took place with the T.U.C. and employers&apos;  organisations.    Clauses to dead with such important and controversial matters as the overtime provisions and the special circumstances arising from the railway agreements were drafted which largely disposed of the difficulties which had formerly been in the way of progress.    The Bill was introduced on 16th April, 1930,  and reintroduced on 13th November, 1930. 4.      The special railway clause did not satisfy the Transport and General workers&apos;  Union but, at a recent deputation,  a proposal to exclude road transport workers from the scope of this clause was accepted in principle by the railway.unions and this practically disposes of the one serious difficulty which remained.5.      While the employers object to any statutory regulation of hours at all they feel that their difficulties have been more fairly met in this Bill than in others which have been proposed.      The desires of the unions are in the direction of further restriction and can be dealt with in Committee.6.      Both the League of Nations Union and the Trades Union Congress General Council have recently brought deputations to press for the Bill to be passed through its further stages.      The Prime Minister authorised the following statement to be made to.the League of Nations Union:-
&quot;The Government are anxious to ratify the Convention. They have shown their good ^PrrfiXi^ &quot;by the announcement of their intention at Geneva in June 1929 and by the preparation and introduction of the necessary Bill.     The delay in passing it into law is due solely to the lack of Parliamentary time owing to the congestion of Government business and the prior claims of other measures-      There is little or no hope of time being available for the Bill this session.      I will bring their representations to the Prime minister s notice in the hope that it may be given a favourable position in the Governments programme next session&quot;.7.      The fact that although a Bill has been introduced, no time has been found for even a Second Beading has created doxibx in Geaeva as to the real intention of the Government to implement the formal announcement of policy made in 1929.      The failure to make progress may have a serious effect on the possibility of getting a Coal Mine Hou&amp; Convention which is really a special application on improved terms of the Washington Hours Convention to the coal industry.      Countries which are hostile to a special Coal Hours Convention may easily use the inaction in respect of the Washington Hours Convention as an argument against action in respect of coal,  especially as some feel that the ratification of the Hours Convention is the main necessity.      Unless,  therefore,  there is some definite further step to which our delegates can point their difficulties, already sufficiently great, will be increased.     Moreover,  it is likely that the matter will be raised on the Director1s Report and some statement will have to be made. 8,      The most helpful course would be definitely to fix a day on which a Second Reading will take place.      This is the only form of announcement which would really be of value since the House of Commons has been given no opportunity of debating the
subject since the Government came into office.      Almost equivalent to this would he an announcement that the Bill will have first place in the autumn Session,Alternatively to the above,    the statement made to the League of Nations Union seems to be the least that could be said.      Short of a statement which gave definite indication of early progress this would seem to be the most prudent course to adopt.(Intd.)    M.G.B.Kcu,12th Masses, 1951.
