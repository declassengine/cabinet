! -    457^document is the property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government.jecret. Copy No . ;- -C - A B 1 NET .,144(51)TWENTY-POUR HOUR METHOD OF EXPRESSING TIME.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary, the Minister of Transport and the Postmaster-General.We desire to obtain the views of our colleagues on the question whether the Government should take any steps to secure the adoption of the 24-hour system in this country.This matter was the subject of a debate in the House ofLords on the 6th May, on a motion moved by Lord Newton in thefollowing terms:-&quot;That in accordance with the recommendations of the Home Office Committee appointed in 191a to report upon the advisability of adopting,  for official and other purposes, the twenty-four-hour method of expressing time, the Ministry of Transport should invite the railway companies to adopt this system from a certain date,  and that it should be simultaneously introduced intc- .the Post Office.&quot;In replying to the motion, the Government Spokesman promised that the matter would receive careful and sympathetic consideration.On the 12th May, the Prime Minister,  in reply to a question by Mr, Smithers,  said that the Departments concerned would consider the matter in the light of the discussion which had taken place in the House of Lords.This matter concerns all Departments of the Government, but the General Post Office and the transport services have a special interest.The 24-hour system,  as it is popularly callsd, is merely a method of expressing time in writing,  and the advantage claimed for it is that it eliminates the necessity of using a.m. and p.m. which may be a possible source of error and confusion.   Thus 7.30 p,m. is expressed as 19,30o   The system is already in use in this country for service purposes in the/naval,
naval, military and air forces of the Crown.    It is  also used onthe Continent in railway time tables and in the Continentaltime tables  (or some of them, e.g. Bradshaw) published in thiscountry.   Where long distance journeys covering more than one day&apos;s travelling are in question, the  system is obviouslysimple and more convenient than ours.The conclusions and recommendations of the DepartmentalCommittee appointed by the Home Secretary, which considered thequestion in 1919,  are as follows&quot;Conclusions and Recommendations.- We have come to the conclusion that the adoption of the system of calculating the time in one period of 24 hours instead of two periods of 12 hours each has considerable advantages, but we do not think it necessary or desirable to suggest the introduction of legislation at present to enforce the use of the system for all public and official purposes.We recommend that the Ministry of Transport should be asked to call on the railway companies to adopt the twenty-four-hour system from a certain date.    The railway time tables are used so generally that we think the benefit of the new method would soon appeal to all concerned, and that other public bodies and large commercial interests would see the advantage of its adoption.We are satisfied that the alteration of the railway time tables could be easily effected without any great expense.    Prom the opinions we have obtained it is evident that most of the railway companies are willing to adopt it, and that those whe have much Continental passenger traffic and are therefore experienced in Continental practice are in favour of its adoption.The work of the Post Office is so intimately bound up with the railway service that we feel that the adoption of the twenty-four-hour system by the railways would in practice entail its adoption by the Post Office.   We therefore recommend that the twenty-four-hour system should be introduced into the Post Office simultaneously with its adoption by the railways .If the public take to the alterations as we expect they will, we are of opinion that the shipping lines will readily adopt it,&quot;In 1920, the General Post Office and the railway companies were prepared to adopt the system, but the Government of theday decided not to act on the Committee&apos;s recommendation onthe ground that there was no public demand for the change, andthat it would be unpopular./It
459It is for the Cabinet to decide whether, in view of the debate in the House of Lords and the support which the demand, for the change has received in the public press, it is desirable that action should be initiated by the responsible Government Departments.   As regards the General Post Office, the change could be made properly effective only by general adoption throughout the Post Office service.    This would involve the use of the 24-hour system not only in postmarks and in the timing of telegrams, but In the plates displayed on Pillar boxes, in all references in the Post Office Guide and in the notices exhibited at Post Offices.    In the case of the railway companies the change will affect only the time tables apparently,    it is understood that while they would not oppose the adoption of the 24-hour system they hold the view that it is not for them to take the initiative in the matter.As regards the attitude of the general public,  it is impossible to say that there is any general support for the change.    Distinguished persons have expressed themselves in favour of the change, and distinguished persons have expressed themselves as opposed to it.    It can confidently be said that the great body of public opinion is entirely apathetic.    In this country there are few journeys of sufficient duration to make the use of the system in time tables of outstanding advantage,  and on the other hand a large number of estimable people whose mathematics are not their strong point will be sadly worried to find an expression like 19.30 in place of the familiar 7.30 p.m.    Perhaps In time they would come to understand, but the  authors of the change will come in for many heartfelt maledictions before that happens  !.Legislation was not recommended by the 1919 Committee, nor is It necessary.    If the Government decide that the limited change asked for in Lord Newton&apos;s motion should be made it can be done by administrative action on the part of the Postmaster General, and the system could be used by Government/departments
489departments in their correspondence and in documents, public notices, etc., issued by them or on their behalf.   As regards railway companies, the Minister of Transport is not in a position to compel them to make the change, but he could of course invite them to do so.    No mention was made in the House of Lords debate of other bodies operating sea, air and road transport services, but it could be left to them to follow suit or not, as they liked.J oR . 0 .H .M.
