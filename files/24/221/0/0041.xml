This document is the property, of His Britannic Hejesty&apos;s government copy Wo . et141(31) SWEEPSTAKES AND LOTTERIES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.My colleagues will remember that in December last I circulated a memorandum (C.P.413  (30)) in regard to sweepstakes promoted in the Irish Free State, and that the Cabinet at their meeting on the 10th December last  (Cabinet Conclusions 72(30) Conclusion 10)  agreed in principle with my proposal that the existing law should be reviewed and invited me to make suggestions as to the form which that review should take.In pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision I informed the House of Commons on the 11th December last that,  if satisfied of the existence of  any general demand for the setting up of a Committee to consider the conditions which would be necessary and appropriate if lotteries were to be permitted as a method of raising money for approved public purposes,  I should be prepared to consider what would be the best method of giving effect to such a demand.I thought that this statement would have elicited some &apos; definite indication of the attitude of those responsible for the more important charities in this country, but so far the authorities of the English hospitals have not pronounced publicly any definite views on the question of legalising sweepstakes for charitable objects,  and on the 20th April last,  I informed the House that in my opinion it would be wise to defer a decision on the question of setting up &amp; Committee for some  time longer, particularly as there could be no qus stion of legislation this Session.The situation, however,  is now so unsatisfactory that I am afraid it is no longer possible to postpone taking a decision, and in my view the time has come when it is necessary for the Cebinet to determine its policy on this very controversial question.   My colleagues will remember that on the 19th May, Sir William Davison asked leave under the Ten Minutes Rule to/bring
bring&apos;in a Bill to authorise the raising of money &quot;by means of ilotteries for the support of hospitals,  and that leave was refused by 181 votes to 58, 133 Members of our Party voting against the Bill, while only 17 voted in favour.    It seems to be beyond question that if there is to be  any alteration of the law relating to lotteries,  that alteration should be effected by a Government measure, and this was probably one of the reasons which prompted the House to refuse leave to Sir William Davison to bring in his Bill.As is well known,  public lotteries of whatever form,  and whether promoted\in this country or not,  are illegal in this country,   aid so long as the lew remains unaltered the authorities have no alternative but to endeavour to carry out the 1 aw .Parliament has frequently been informed.of the position, but everyone is aware that though every attempt has been made to enforce the law, those  attempts have failed.    In addition to the practical difficulties experienced in bringing offenders against the law to account, there Is the further difficulty that some Courts have so far shown themselves reluctant to co-operate in a strict enforcement of the law on the ground that it is out of harmony with modern conditions, and have dealt with offenders brought before them by imposing only a nominal fine in a large number of cases.,    This persistent and deliberate disregard of the law - if allowed to continue - is bound to have the most unfortunate reaction.I have for  s long time been giving most anxious thought to this problem, and there seem to be only two possible courses of action open to the Government.(1)    The first Is to   ask Parliament to arm the executive with additional powers to enable the existing law to be enforced.    Such powers would have to be very drastic,  involving among other things the confiscation of prizes and the suppression of advertisements.    I need not,  for present purposes,/go
go into detail but my colleagues should know that,  In the opinion of my advisers,  it is more than doubtful whether any powers which Parliament would be likely to grant would in practice prove effective.(2)    The second alternative is to propose legislation with the object of legalising sweepstakes under proper conditions and safeguards,  if such can be devised.It is not necessary at this stage to discuss these alternatives in detail.    Both would require legislation,  and I take it that there is no prospect of legislation in the immediate future.    The only question v-hich requires an immediate decision is whether there should be some form of inquiry as a preliminary to  the consideration by the Cabinet of the problem, with a view to formulating a Government policy.    I am constantly bemng asked in the House whether the Government propose to set up a Committee of Inquiry, and further delay in announcing the Governments policy is likely to lead to criticism.As opinion on the question of lotteries is so divided and as any proposal to alter the law is bound to be controversial, my own view is that the Government should not propose legislation unless that legislation is preceded by an inquiry into the problem in all its aspects, and is based upon the recommendations of a Committee which will command public confidence and support.    In these circumstances my own inclination is in favour of an inquiry by a Select Committee, possibly a Joint Select Committee, but I should be glad if the Cabinet would consider the question and would advise me as to the policy which I should announce on behalf of the Government.J .R .C .HOME OFFICE:4th June,  1951
