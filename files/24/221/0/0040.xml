The Proposed Austro-German Customs Union,, Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign,. Affairs.1.     I arn circulating to my Colleagues a resume of the work done at the recent meetings of the Council of the League of Nations and of the Committee of Enquiry for European Union. In the meantime, however, I deem it advisable to ask for a decision on the appointment of a British representative on one of three Technical Committees which have been set up.2.     The Council of the League of Nations at its recent meeting unanimously agreed to refer to the Permanent Court of International Justice the question whether the proposed Austro-German Customs Union would or would not be consistent with the international Treaty obligations which Austria has assumed by the Peace Treaty of 1919 and the proposal No. I of 1922.     The Austrian Foreign Minister further agreed to suspend all further negotiations for the Union until the opinion of the Court should have been rendered.3.     The fact that these decisions were taken in a friendly atmosphere and as a result of harmonious debate is in itself an important result, and one which well illustrates the value of international arbitration.4.     But the discussions at Geneva, both in the Council and in the European Committee, made it plain that the opinion of the Court cannot by itself bring a solution of the problem which the Austro-German agreement has created.     When the legal issue has been disposed of, there will still remain the economic and political aspects of the matter to be considered.     I was deeply impressed by the importance which all the Governments of Central Europe attach to thematter.
matter.   They all made it plain that it is by far the most important political issue which has arisen in Europe since the war.   Indeed, I reached the definite conclusion!  that if we can find some agreed solution of the problem which will satisfy all parties on the economic and political sides of the matter, then we should be justified in looking forward to a future of peace and closer international co-operation in Europe;   but that if no such solution can be found, then we must expect international developments of a most dangerous kind.5.     For this reason, the chief significance of the reference cf the legal question to the Court seems to me to lie in the breathing-space which it gives to the Governments- to find some agreed alternative solution, which will not only bring the Austrians and Germans as much economic relief as they could get from the proposed Customs Union,, but which will also be of value to other European countries as well.    1 made every effort in Geneva to make my colleagues see that this result was both possible and practicable, if their Governments would agree to co-operate in seeking some programme of concerted economic action which would bring common relief to all.6.     I found a wide-spread measure of agreement that such a programme of co; certed action was urgently required, and I formed the clear impression that the danger of the present economic crisis had created a readiness to &quot;compromise&quot; and to make &quot;sacrifices&quot; in the general interest which did not exist a few months ago.    Indeed, there is a general realisation in Central Europe that unless existing economicconditions
conditions are rapidly improved by concerted international action, the danger of social disturbance   and even civil war in Germany and other countries may become acute,,70     Thus in the discussions of the European Committee the question of the Austro-German Union became merged with that of the economic crisis, and there was general agreement that the solution for both must be found during the next few smonths on the lines I have indicated above.8e    V/ith this in view, the European Committee set up three technical Committees:   Agricultural, Financial and EconomicsThe Agricultural Committee is to meet in a few days&apos; time, and is to seek some means of restoring the prosperity of the agricultural countries of Central and South Eastern Europe, which constitute so important a potential market for the manufactured goods of the industrial countries.The Financial Committee is to consider whether any means can be found to   overcome the existing credit difficulties which are at present accentuating the economic crisis.     I. understand that on this Committee His Majesty&apos;s Government will be represented by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.The Economic Committee is to consist of &quot;highly qualified economists of general competence&quot;, and it is desired that it should be composed of independent persons who, while in contact with their Governments, should be independent and therefore free to recommend whatever measures they may deem appropriate to deal with the present distress.     The mandate of this Committee empowers it to propose any form of concerted international economic co-operation which it-thinks desirable, and it will certainly deal, among other things,with
with the reduction of the existing European Tariff barriers. After consultation with the Treasury and with the President of the Board of Trade, I propose that I should be authorised to invite Sir Walter Layton to sit on this Committee as the nominee of His Majesty&apos;s Government.9.     The Reports of these three Technical Committees are to be sent in to a political Co-ordination Committee, which is in turn to report upon them to the European Committee at its next meeting on September 1st.I submit that the whole weight Of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s influence should be used in all these Committees and in other ways in securing during the next three months a programme of practical measures which will serve both to liquidate the question of the Austro-German Customs Union and to mitigate the economic crisis which threatens the political stability of Europe.2nd June, 1931.A.H.
