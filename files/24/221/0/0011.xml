[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1931.MOST SECRET.CP. Ill (31).CABINET.SITUATION IN INDIA.The subjoined telegrams from the Government of India on the general situation are circulated by the Secretary of State for India for the information of his colleagues. The telegram dated 27th April answers a request for information in connection with Lord PeePs question in the House of Lords to-day.India Office. 29th April 1931.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated,21th April 1931.1192 S. In regard to boycott of British goods, it may be said that open preaching of boycott of British goods as a political weapon has practically ceased since settlement, and very few instances have come to our notice in which there has been discrimination against British goods as such. We have recently seen intercepted correspondence which may indicate a movement in this direction, and are making further enquiries, but present information does not justify mention of this. The boycott of foreign (including British) goods, especially of cloth, is being advocated on ostensibly economic grounds. It is effective only in regard to cloth, in regard to-which movement in favour of Swadeshi is strong. Our general impression is that sales of foreign (including British) cloth has increased since settlement, and that existing stocks are being cleared. But a number of dealers still abstain from sale, and, although abstention of some is purely voluntary, it is also the case that some abstain becaiise of fear of Congress and uncertainty of future, and also probabby because of indirect pressure, which, however, is very difficult to prove.Picketing is much reduced, but there are signs of revival in some places-Complaints of objectionable methods are decreasing, but we are still receiving a few. AVith occasional and local exceptions, picketing is unaggressive.Unless there is a breakdown of the settlement, we believe that economic and other forces will operate in favour of the gradual revival of British trade, but there is no effective means of accelerating this,&apos; and constant ventilation of the subject, and especially of Lancashire grievances, defeats its own purpose.You no doubt realise that the following factors also militate against such rapid improvement in piece-goods trade as Lancashire expects. Five per cent, surcharge placed on imports of cotton piece-goods has placed Indian mills in better position to meet Indian demands. Protective effect of revenue tariff is now 20 per cent, ad valorem on cotton piece-goods of British manufacture. Owing to decreased purchasing power of the Indian consumer, price factor is all important, and natural demand for cheaper qualities is effective support to Swadeshi movement. Com-potition from Japan, who has been able to reduce her prices, is also very keen. At the same time, it must be recognised that uncertainty as to the duration of the settlement and possibility of renewal of political boycott make buyers. nervous. In fact, sound recovery of British trade depends not so much- on the settlement as on the early conclusion of constitutional issue for which the settlement has given opportunity.2. In regard to the political situation generally, the following aspects may bo distinguished. First, terrorist; second, communal; third, political agitation not directly connected with these.Execution of Bhagat Singh, &amp;c. was followed by. sjoate of violent speeches and writings and of sympathetic demonstrations.    Excitement subsided . more quickly than was expected, but.disturbing features are absence of public condemnation; of political murders.   Support, given at the Karachi Congress for the release of all   &apos;      n; 5392      100   4.31 ACopy No
political prisoners includes assassins. Resolution of sympathy passed at Sikh League, not only with. Bhagat Singh, but also with, the murder of Mrs. Curtis. This last resolution, and the murder of Peddie, have caused some reaction, but in Bengal, Punjab, and, to a less extent, elsewhere, cult of violence must be regarded as dangerous. Punjab have just reported that section of the Press is again very had. We can report no improvement in this direction, but it was anticipated that settlement would give impetus to violence, especially as it was followed soon after by the execution of Bhagat Singh.An estimate of communal situation was given in our telegram of 14th April.0 There has been no material change since, but feeling between Congress Muslims and other Muslims is getting more acute.In regard to general political situation there has been definite improvement in Bombay Presidency generally, and distinct signs of improvement during the past fortnight in Gujarat, where collections of land revenue are better.You have been kept informed by Foreign and Political Department of situation in North-West Frontier Province, which is at present chief cause of anxiety owing to activities of Abdul Ghafur and red shirts. The continued enlistment of. latter and Abdul GhafuPs attitude towards settlement as temporary truce, combined with attempt to spread movement across the frontier, creates position of instability which may demand early action.In United Provinces causes for anxiety are communal and agrarian. Congress have definitely attempted to exploit economic conditions and have not observed spirit of settlement. They have been active in rural areas, and situation may be regarded as definitely worse in some districts than before settlement. Hailey will probably meet Gandhi shortly with, a view to stoppage of objectionable methods. This latter fact should not be mentioned. While position is far from satisfactory, we are inclined to regard it with less concern than a few weeks ago, and see some prospect of improvement, although this is uncertain.In Punjab, there are signs of agrarian agitation and communal feeling is high. Otherwise situation is fairly satisfactory.Position has definitely improved since the settlement in Bengal, Madras, Assam and Central Provinces, and there are some indications in Bihar and Orissa of recovery from the deterioration which occurred there.3. Viewing the situation as a whole, it is premature to judge the results of the settlement. In some directions they have been definitely good, in others they have not yet reached expectations. There is widespread desire for peace and there would be general regret if there were a rapture. We believe that Gandhi is doing his best to implement the settlement. But there is far too much talk of consolidation in case of renewal of the struggle, and Congress activities in. some Provinces indicate a spirit of arrogance which is^a menace to the future, and which now embitters communal relations. There are&apos;1 obviously difficulties and clangers ahead, especially in North-West Frontier Province and United Provinces, and these might materialise at an early date. But almost equal difficulties have been surmounted during the past two months and we are not unhopeful that solution may be found of existing ones. In the meantime, we have made it clear to Local Governments that settlement does not connote abrogation of ordinary law, and that in particular action should ordinarily be taken in regard to incitement to violence.* Extract below.Extract from Government of Indians telegram of 14th April 1931.We reported two weeks ago that the communal situation was fraught with grave potentialities. The situation has worsened since then. Previous to Karachi, Gandhi had definitely indicated that he would accept all the Muslims demands, and Vallabhai Patel had made much the same promise. It appears that at Karachi Gandhi shifted his ground and made a reservation against separate&quot; electorates, a question on which majority of Muslims hold strongest opinions. During the first week of April All-India Muslim Conference was held at Delhi, and while it was sitting conversations were held between certain Muslim leaders and Gandhi. The Conference itself was remarkable for vehement speeches, hardening of Muslim opinion and bitter hostility towards Congress. It adopted a non-compromising attitude on separate electorates. Conversations with Gandhi were marked by very plain speaking and prospects of an
noearly settlement definitely disappeared. Gandhi appears to have made a bad blunder in dealing with Muslims. Congress have a certain number of Muslim adherents, but, generally speaking, they are regarded as suspects by community as a whole&apos; and command little influence. They support joint electorates. Gandhi has used them as an excuse for saying that Muslims are not united, and has delayed attempt towards a settlement until there is a unanimous demand. This device has deceived no one and has made Muslims very angry. At the same time, Congress are reported to have plan for exploiting differences between Muslims and for campaign to convert Muslims to Nationalist principles. This is certain to intensify feeling against Congress and to increase danger, already grave, of communal strife and also of trouble between Muslims themselves.One result of recent events has been to cause reaction among Muslims against responsibility at Centre. Doubts are now freely expressed as to whether they will be able effectively to protect themselves, even if fourteen points are conceded in full, against a Plindu Central Government, and movement appears to be gaining ground among Muslim community in favour of Provincial consolidation before important changes are made at Centre. On the other hand, there appears less inclination among Hindus to compromise on communal matters, and in some Congress circles there is a feeling that Congress having made sacrifices during the past year should not lose fruits of their labours through Muslim opposition.Sikhs, for their part, have just passed number of resolutions which do not facilitate a communal settlement in the Punjab. The position of minorities as a whole is thus very complex and delicate, but it has in it this element of hope, that it represents recognition of facts which there was a tendency to ignore or, at ieast, to obscure, and if a settlement is obtained it is therefore more likely to be enduring.
