secretary. COPY %Q......   ____________7pTl36(3l).CABINET. REORGANISATION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY. Memorandums^ theWe last reported to our colleagues on the subject of the reorganisation of the cotton industry on 33rd February (0.P.59/31), when we indicated that at a meeting on the 18th February with the representatives of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations (the body v/hich is representative of all sections of the industry,  employees as well as employers) we had been told that a few days previously the Executive Committee of the Joint Committee had initiated a discussion of the problem of surplus productive capacity in the industry. That discussion has been energetically pursued at a series of meetings which have been held during the past three months (meetings of the iihcecutive Committee and of the full Joint Committee itself, as well as  sectional meetings of the variousorganisations represented on the Joint Committee) and has resulted in the unanimous adoption of a series of Resolutions, of ^srhich a copy is annexed (Annex l).Resolution No.  1 reviews the main factors within the industry which affect its present position and brings out clearly th?t a root cause of the industry&apos;s difficulties is the existence of a considerable surplus of productive capacity for the use of which there is no prospective demand.This leads up to Resolution No.  3,  which proposes that an investigator should be appointed with statutory powers of enquiry and with the duty of securing information for the use of the Executive Committee in preparing a scheme for-1-HIQOCUM^ IS THS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT,36
maintaining a closer relation between capacity and demand. This Resolution has to be read in conjunction with Resolution No. 4, which was added subsequently and records the intention of the Joii^-t Committee to endeavour in the first place to collect the information necessaiy to the formulation of a scheme on a voluntary basis and without resort to statutory powers of enquiry.     As the Resolution points out, this procedure will avoid delay;    it will be equally effective for the purpose in view if the necessary measure of co-operation on the   part of those engaged in the industry can be secured.Resolution No, 3 deals with various   measures which, should accompany the adjustment of productive capacity and calls for no comment at the present stage.We have kept closely in touch with the developments of this discussion, which represents a concerted effort on the part of the cotton industry to tackle one of the root causes of its present troubles and weakness, viz:- the existence of an amount of plant considerably in excess of present or prospective needs.The meeting of the Joint Committee at which the Resolutions were adopted unanimously was   held on Friday last, the 15th instant, and on lionday we again met the Joint Committee representatives who wished to report formally to us this result of their endeavours and to obtain an assurance that they havo the support of the Government in regard to these Resolutions.We think that the Joint Committee are to be congratulated on the progress which they have made in a comparatively short time with a difficult problem and that to have secured a unanimous decision from all sections of the industry marks a definite step forward on the path of reorganisation, although there is of course a long way yet
to go.    In reply to our questions, the representatives said that they believed that they would be able to secure, on the voluntary basis proposed in Resolution No. 4, a volume of information sufficient to enable them to formulate a scheme for the regulation of productive capacity.    If this proves to be the case, time will certainly be saved and we  think that the Joint Committee^ proposal to proceed if possible without statutory powers of enquiry should be adopted.    The question of legislation will in these circumstances not arise until the scheme itself has been prepared.The representatives also told us that they propose forthwith to discuss the outlines of the scheme, the details of which they will fill in when the enquiry has produced the necessary information, and that they are aiming to be in a position to decide on the plan by the end of July.    Many difficult points remain to be settled, but on the assumption that the Joint Committee succeed in adhering to their programme, and in producing by that time an acceptable scheme having the general support of the industry,  the legislation necessary to give effect to it would require to be introduced in the early days of the new Session.Meanwhile, we promised to report the position to our colleagues and to inform the Joint Committee of the Government&apos;s views as soon as possiblo.   We suggest that the Home Secretary should send a letter to Mr. Barlow, the Chairman of tho Joint Committee, in the terms of the annexed draft (Annex Ii).J.R.C. W.G.30th nay, 1931.
ANNEX I.JOINT COMMITTEE OF COTTON TRADE ORGANISATIONS.RESOLUTION 1.The Joint Committee feels that the investigations into the problems of the industry which have been conducted both by itself and by the Government Committee of Inquiry,  should now be followed by the adoption of a definite programme of action.     Such a general plan must be based on acceptance of the industry&apos;s responsibility for dealing with those of its difficulties which concern it most directly.     The influence of various external factors,  equally material to the welfare of the industry, is fully recognised, but for the immediate future it is obviously desirable that the industry should concentrate on problems which are more or less ?/ithin its own control.The conditions which govern the present position of thecotton industry are:-(l; Costs of production in Lancashire, generally speaxing, are higher than they are in other cotton industries, ^ven when the depression in world trade lifts this disadvantage will still affect Lancashire&apos;s competitive, power in world markets.(S) The Lancashire cotton industry is mainly dependent on the export trade and its productive power is three or four times greater than any conceivable home demand.(3) There is no reason to suppose that the cotton industries of other countries will become less competitive and though there are still many markets in which the normal expansion of wealth and population should bring increased opportunities for&quot;the Lancashire industry, its progress will be made more difficult by the efforts of its present competitors to develop their own trade in neutral markets, and by the growth of new cotton industries in such markets, aided by tariffs.(4) Under present conditions, our productive capacity inthe immediate future will largely exceed the demand for our goods, as it has done during the last ten years.(5j This surplus of productive capacity has contributed toour present distress, since the internal competition of numerous individual firms has resulted in uneconomic selling, and in consequent heavy losses.      These in turn have diminished the resources which should have been available for replacement of plant,  and for
pmdevelopment of new enterprise.(6) In normal circumstances the balance between supply and demand would have been maintained by the free operation of economic forces.   &apos; Since the war, however,&apos; the financial support of banks and other outside interests has led to the continuance in the industry of many firms which could not have survived under ordinary financial conditions.Another factor which has delayed the response of the industry to the changed post-war conditions is a certain rigidity, which arises inevitably from the present structure of the industry,  and is exhibited on the one hand in the policy of price associations in some sections and on the other in the failure of employers and employed generally to reach agreement as to the desirability of modifying methods of working and of payment in accordance with technical progress.(7) The continued existence of this huge surplus of pro-ductive capacity gravely prejudices the possibility of effective steps toward reduction of costs..    The will-ingness of individual firms,  of trade associations, and of trade unions,  to consider improvements in practice or in organisation is limited by the fact that the effects of such action can only be partial.(8) Means must be found to restore harmony between productive power and prospective demand.     Instead of continuing the effort to find employment for all the firms now in existence and for all the operatives now nominally dependent upon the industry, Lancashire must consider whether it would not be wiser to concentrate production upon the best of the existing machinery and to give full and steady employment to a smaller number of people.
cr, rj r* 0 I 0RESOLUTION 2.The Joint Committee helleves that the first -step towards any form of reorganisation or towards, trade recovery is adjustment of productive capacity in the cotton industry to its present and prospective needs so that all active units should, as nearly as possible,  run full timec    Normal economic forces are not being allowed to bring about such an adjustment.    Up to the preoent, voluntary agreement for this purpose has been unattainable.   As the detailed basis of such an adjustment cannot be formulated without accurate and complete information upon the present capacity and efficiency of the industry,  the Joint Committee recommends that an Investigator or investigators should be appointed with statutory powers of inquiry, whose duty it should be to secure information for the use of the Executive in preparing a scheme for maintaining a closer relation between capacity and demand.
RESOLUTION 5,Any process of adjustment must be accompanied by further measures to strengthen Lancashire&apos;s competitive position.    Other cotton industries have developed along different lines,  which have in some countries led to remarkable aohievements.    It does not follow, however,  that the methods by which our competitors have succeeded would be equally successful in Lancashire.    It is questionable whether any generalisation on the subject is of much value, or whether indeed there is any single method of organisation which is right,  all others being wrong.There are obvious objections to the summary introduction of methods for which inadequate experience exists,    and which can be applied only against the will of large numbers of people now holding executive positions in the industry.    Our aim should be to seek competitive efficiency by any available means, but it would be foolish to cast away in the  search any advantages which we already possess.Though much has been done in ^various directions, among the subjects which could profitably be further examined are:-(l) closer and more effective co-operation between different sections of the industrye(2) further amalgamations of individual firms in some sections.(3) better contact between firms in each section.(4) methods of wage calculation and negotiation.(5) methods of distribution.(6) simplification and . standardisation of trade practices.(7) application of the results of research to actual production.(8) propaganda at home and abroad.(9) more regular and accurate information.Many of these problems now appear insoluble but the Joint Committee believes that a satisfactory solution of the capacity problem will open up methods of approach which are now lacking.    The removal of this preliminary difficulty will not only stimulate individual action but will facilitate the adoption where necessary of general measures which can only be undertaken by the industry as a whole.
Resolution 4.,The Joint Committee instructs the Executive to take the necessary steps to carry out the investigation recommended in Resolution No. 2, of April 9.     The Committee feels that with the goodwill of all sections it should he possible to obtain sufficient information without resort to statutory powers/ and in order to avoid the delay involved in seeking such powers, it appeals to the public spirit of all firms engaged in the industry, whether members of trade organisations or not, to assist by providing the requisite particulars.The Committee requests the Executive, on the basis of the information obtained, to prepare a plan for their consideration and for that of the trade generally, dealing with the adjustment of capacity and with all other measures for the reduction of costs which can be undertaken or encouraged by joint action.
ANNEX ii.Draft of letter to be sent by the Home Secretary to Mr. T.D, Barlow, Chairman, Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations, Ship Canal House, King Street Manchester.Dear Mr. Barlow,The President of the Board of Trade and I have discussed with our colleagues in the Cabinet the subject of the talk which we had with you, Mr. Grey and Mr. Hughes, at the House of Commons on the 18th May.The Government note with satisfaction the activ-: steps which are being taken by the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations in the endeavour to find a solution for the difficulties now confronting the cotton industry, and in particular those arising from the present excess of productive capacity.The Resolutions which wore unanimously passed by the representatives of all sections of the industry at the meeting of the Joint Committee on May 15th have beon carefully considered and the Government agree with the proposal that,  in order to expedite matters,  the info mation necessary to the formulation of a scheme for maintaining capacity in closer relation to demand should, if possible, be collected on a voluntary basis, without resort to the statutory powers contemplated in Resolution No.2.The Government await with interest the further results of the Joint Committee&apos;s efforts.
