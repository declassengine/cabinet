DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO._5CABINET. PROPOSED TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS. Memorandum by the President of the Board&apos; of Trade.My colleagues will be aware that in pursuance of arrangements made at Geneva last year proposals were recently put forward by His Majesty&apos;e Government to seven European countries with a view to securing a general lowering of customs tariffs.   The general form of these proposals consisted of a list of headings in the customs tariffs of each country concerned which represented a substantial volume of trade from this country, with a request that the dutiee at present applied should, where considerable, be reduced by 25 per cent and where the goods were already free of duty or subject only to a low rate, that the existing conditions should be maintained.    At the  same time as these proposale were put forward the Governments of each country were asked whether there were any proposals they would wish to make in regard to the treatment accorded in the united Kingdom, to the goods in which they were interested.Six of these countries, viz., Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland and Switzerland, whilst expressing a readiness to enter into negotiations, have now furnished an indication of the nature of the counter proposals they would wish to put forward, the Italian Government alone having failed to Bend any reply other than a statement that.the examination of our proposals, the extent of which exceeded their anticipations, would necessarily take some considerable time.     The French proposals have it is true not yet been communicated to us through the diplomatic channel, but were hand.ed to me by two French officials who happened to be visiting London recently and who took the opportunity to call at the Board of Trade for the purpose of&apos; ^&apos; i1 ^ll^rtlHmHmnifWIWUMIIWlTWIWWHWIIIHIIIIIHfl^MWWIW^IIlBlliwhipbui......iiiiniiii..........iiiiiiiiiiihiiiimmmi^^.............. i    . i1..124(51).
informal discussions.    In only one of tiie six replies, however, namely, in that from the Austrian G-overnment, has any indication been afforded of the extent to which in the most favourable circumstances it might be possible to meet our desiderata.   Prom the Austrian reply it appears that that Government are not in fact prepared to reduce the duties levied on any of the goods included In the British proposals (which suggested reductions of duty in respect of goods amounting in value to some  360,000 per annum) except on one insignificant item, viz. gramophone records of a somewhat unusual description.   The French officials above referred to also explained that the French Government would find it difficult to accord reductions to any considerable volume of Britiah goods, failing some arrangement with the traders concerned by which the exports to France would be limited in amount.The essential object of our proposals was, of course, to secure actual reductions of duties over a wide field and only incidentally to secure consolidation of existing low duties-.    It appears to me, therefore, that before any further step can usefully be taken to initiate negotiations it is essential that we should know generally so far as possible whether such negotiations are likely to serve that end, and that it would accordingly be desirable to approach each of theae Governments again (other than the Government of Austria) v/ioh a view to obtaining such more detailed information as may be necessary for the purpose.
In doing so, however,  it is necessary to take into account the counter proposals which these Governments have made to us.    Those counter proposals include requests for the maintenance of the existing free trade regime in so far as goods are at present free of inroort duty in this country, hut they also include requests for undertakings that certain goods at present dutiable,  e0g. wine,  silk and sugar, shall not be subject to higher duties than those at present in force, and in some cases they ask for actual reductions in those duties, which are, of course, essentially of a fiscal character.It is of interest to note that in the case of Switzerland the counter proposals of that country consist entirely of requests for reductions of fiscal duties which are of special interest to Switzerlands    I presume that there can be little, if any, possibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government being prepared to give any undertaking with regard to goods at present liable to customs duty, other than those which are subject to safeguarding duties, destined to expire in due course when the period for which they were originally imposed has elapsed. There are other elements in certain of the counter proposals, notably those put forward by the French Government,  on which any concessions would obviously be difficult if not impossible.Thus the French Government ask for an alteration   in the point of division of the existing United Kingdom wine scale,  an increase in the excise in British wines, and a more complete protection of French wine names,  (e.g0 Burgundy) as well as for the conclusion of arrangements which would permit of the importation of French animals and meat.In these circumstances it would seem most desirable that in asking the foreign governments concerned to give a more precise indication of the goods in regard to which substantial reductions of duty would be possible, we should at the same time indicate at least the general nature of the undertakings we
might he prepared to give if there- were a general readiness on the part of the principal countries concerned to reduce the level of their Customs tariffs to a substantial extent, over a wide field.      In the absence of some such general indication it is to be anticipated that the replies that would be received would be of little practical value for the purpose of determining whether and in what conditions the negotiations could be proceeded with.It therefore becomes important to consider what in fact we could undertake to do if the above conditions were in fact fulfilled, i.e. if the countries concerned were in fact prepared to accord such substantial reductions as would alone justify any undertaking on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government at all.     It seems to me that in such circumstances we could very well undertake that no fresh protective duty should be imposed on goods which are at present free of customs duty In the United Kingdom, though for what period such undertaking should be given would have to remain over for further consideration, and, of course, that existing temporary safeguarding duties should not be renewed when the period for which they have been imposed has expired.On the other hand we should undoubtedly hesitate before giving any pledge not to increase the duty on goods at present dutiable, and oven more before offering to reduce any such duties.If my colleagues share the above view I would propose that our representatives at Brussels,. Warsaw, Berlin and Paris should now be instructed to address a communication to the respective Governments to which they are accredited informing them that the counter proposals they have put forward have received preliminary consideration and that His Majesty&apos;s Government think it right to inform thorn that they would find it difficult to enter into any undertaking to maintain at their present level
any existing duties that way be in force in the United Kingdom, and still more difficult to reduce them.     Should, however, the principcl countries they have approached be ready to meet the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government by reducing substantially the duties now levied on goods of interest to the United Kingdom of which lists have already been furnished His Majesty&apos;s Government would for their pf\rt be prepared to contemplate the possibility of giving a pledge that for o period to be determined, no fresh protective duty should be imposed on goods which are at present free of Customs duty in the United Kingdom,  and that existing temporary &quot;safeguarding&quot; duties shall not be renewed when the period for which they have been imposed has expired.In the communication to be made to the French Government it might be added that whilst the possibility of some minor adjustments in Customs administration are, of course, not ruled out, certain of the items included in their desiderata would hardly seem to be in the region of practical politics.The four Governments in question might then be asked categorically, having regard to the above declaration,  to be good enough to explain in as full detail as possible the extent to which they would be prepared to meet the desiderate-: of His Majesty&apos;s Government, end in particular to state in regard to which particular -articles included in the lists which h?ve been already submitted to them they would be prepared, in return for such assurances as are above indicated,  to reduce the existing duties by 35 per cent, as it is only in the light of full end detailed statements on these lines that His Majesty&apos;s Government can reach a preliminary conclusion as to whether the existing negotiations can usefully be proceeded with.      If, is possible, some of theue Governments take the lino that the reductions they could offer would depend not merely on the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the United Kingdom Customs tariff, but also to some extent on the
possibility of other countries being read&apos; to accord reductions to the United Kingdom which they would enjoy by virtue of most-favoured-notion treatment,  it would be desirable that they should be invited to indicate, not in general terms but with as much precision as possible the extent to which this consideration affects their reply0Having regard to the nature of the Swiss counter proposals, which as I have mentioned,  consist solely of requests for reduction in existing duties (eD g.  on watches,  silk, motor car parts,  and chemical products) the communication to Berne would have to take a somewhat different shape, but the Swiss Government should, of course, be apprised of the communications which are being made to the other four countries and they might be asked whether in fact they regard reduction of United Kingdom duties as a necessary condition of any reduction in the Swiss duties, or whether they would be prepared to reduce any, and if so which,  in return for such an undertaking as is outlined above.The Italian Government should also, I would suggest, be informed of what is being said to the German, Belgium, French and Polish Governments in order to help them in replying to our original proposals.I should be glad to hove the authority of my colleagues for proceeding on the above lines,W,G.15th May,  19 31e Board of Trade,
