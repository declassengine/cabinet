Note by the Secretary for Mines.1, The kines Department is responsible for providing an organisation to deal with all matters relative to the conservation and distribution of fuel during an emergency of the nature contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.2. This organisation has to be built up in advance of anemergency,  so that when a state of emergency is declared it can be put into operation forthwith.3. Experience in past emergencies has shown it to heessential to operate the organisation to some extent through the coal industry, particularly with regard to the control of inland supplies.      For example,  District Coal Emergency Committees,  composed of coalowners, factors and merchants are set up in each of the coalfields.      These Committees regulate the supply and distribution of any coal at a coal mine and any other coal which I may direct to be made available to them. This coal proves a valuable reserve from which to meet demands for essential public services during the emergency, but it is essential to control it from the outset as the collieries make every endeavour to dispose of it at the beginning of a stoppage of work without regard to the purposes for which it is to be used.4. The constitution of these Committees involves negotiationswith inter, alia the various Local Coal Owners&apos; Associations, and takes tine.      Following on the experience gained during the 1926 Emergency it is proposed to make certain changes in the working of these Committes in order to bring them more directly in touch with the Department and as a result of these changes it is probable that the time taken to constitute them for any future occasion will be longer than usual.
Arrangements are already being made to overhaul the Departments Emergency Organisation in view of a possible national coal stoppage in July, and while progress has been made in so far as inter-Departmental arrangements are concerned,  the stage has beon reached when it is necessary, under the seal of secrecy,  to approach representative bodies of coalowners.    It may be argued that at a time when endeavours are being made by the Government to negotiate with the coalowners with a view to avoiding any stoppage of work in July,  it is inopportune to approach them with regard to the personnel of Committees which will only function if there is a national stoppage.    On the other hand,  it would probably be better to approach the coalowners in this matter when the negotiations on working conditions are in their early stages, rather than to defer such approach until the negotiations arc in a more delicate state.There is another consideration which,  in my view, bears on the desirability of asking the coalowners at once to furnish their nominees for the Emergency Committees.  In my negotiations with the coalowners I have found and still find a disposition on their part to regard, with some degree of equanimity,  the position that will arise in July because they think that, without any action on their part,  the Government will find itself forced by economic considerations to introduce legislation to continue the 1926 Act as amended by Part III of the 1930 Act.    I deprecate this attitude.    If the coalowners know that the Government are making active preparations to put its emergency organisation in shape so that it can function without delay,  it would tend to make them more active in trying to find a solution of the July difficulty.
37.A somewhat similar situation arises with regard to coal factors and merchants.They also are required to nominate representatives in order to complete the Emergency Organisation,  but In their case the considerationpart that the Government was preparing its Emergency Organisation would not have any direct beneficial effect upon the negotiations with the Mining Associations and the Miners&apos; Federation.      The Organisation would not be complete without consultation by the Central Associations representing this part of their trade with their local members all over the country, and knowledge would be very general as to the steps which the Governir?.:..t are taking.        While this might have an indirect bene-ficial effect on the attitude of the coal owners, it would also create some alarm and possibly be harmful in connection with foreign contracts.On the other hand, without such consultation the Emergency Organisation cannot be completed and some risk will be taken of chaotic conditions in the early stages of a coal strike if it occurs. 3. In view of the importance of the matter,  I shall beglad to receive instructions whether I am to consult under seal of secrecy (a) the coal owners,  and (b) the coal factors and coal merchants.are not quite the same.Knowledge on theirMines Department,April 28th,  1931,,
