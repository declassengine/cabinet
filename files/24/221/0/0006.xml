TRANSLATION OF A NOTE, DATED APRIL 20fctiL HANDED TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR ON APRIL 22nd.lo   In the course of the final drafting of the agreement, the oases of which had heen adopted on March ,1st last, differences of view became apparent which, if prolonged, might endanger the happy results which, after long and laborious negotiations, it war. legitimate to suppose had been achieved.   The Government of the Republic was not the last to rejoice at the entente which had teen realised, and they anticipated that it would produce in the common interest beneficial results0   This will suffice to explain why the Government of the Republic considers it desirable now to draw the attention of the British and Italian Governments to the situation which has arisen, and for which it is desirable to find a remedy without delay0 Convinced that the sentiments with which they are inspired are also shared in London and Rome, the Government of the Republic will set out with the utmost frankness the details of the problem and the solution for which it appears to call,2c   After the failure of the negotiatio?is which took place following the London Conference with the object oi arriving at a limitation of global tonnage in respect of the Italian   and French fleets, the experts directed their labours towards reaching, on a practical basis, an agreement of a more modest character which would deal simply with the new construction which the two countries would be able to complete before December 31st, 1936. that is to say, upon new construction which, to this end, they could undertake In the years 1931, 1932, 1933 and even in 1934.    Such was in any event the conviction, based on diverse documents, which the French experts had quite sincerely arrived at during their conversations with their British colleague and of which they had left their colleagues in no doubt*
30    I3c   To this end. and knowing that their governments were anxious to avoid any solution which might result in an appreciable increase in the existing tonnage of the fleets,the experts, having studied various alternativesc finally hit upon a. system &quot;based upon the replacement ot overage tonnage; hut they had quickly realised the impossibility cf solving completely the problem of replacing the whole of the overage tonnage with-out running the risk of coming up against the delicate questions which had prevented the success of the preceding negotiations,, It was therefore appreciated on all sides that it would be necessary to exclude from the current negotiations the problem cf. the replacement of tonnage which would remain overage on December 31st, 1935-   The solution of this problem was to be reserved for future negotiation, the issue of which would in no way be prejudiced by the agreement under consideration4o   On the other handi, no difficulty arose regarding an immediate decision as to the laying down of replacement units for tonnage becoming overage in 1937, 1938 and 1939, Consequently the French experts accepted without difficulty, the suggestions which were made to them in this sense.5.   With this exception the &quot;Bases of Agreement&quot; had no bearing upon the construction to be completed after January 1st, 1937,   The situation which would result from the acceptance of the &quot;Bases of Agreement&quot; would therefore be in no v/ay comparable to that resulting for the interested navies from Part III of the Treaty of London,,    Ih effect this lays down, Insofar as the three fleets to which it applies are concerned and in respect of certain classes of warships, tonnage limits covering the construction which the three navies can undertake in the said glasses of ship during the period covered by the Treaty.   The franco-Itallan arrangement was, on the contrary, to deal with he construction which in allclasses
classesof warship, the two countries could respectively complete efore a given date.   With the exception indicated below, which had o hearing on minimum tonnage, this arrangement did not touch the Question of construction which would only he completed after december 31st, 1936.6.    It was in order to emphasize this fundamental difference hat, when the British Ministers returned from Rome on March 1st, he French delegates sought from their colleagues the insertion, Jn he Bases of Agreement, of an amendment making it clear that the Contemplated, accession to the general clauses contained in Part III f the Treaty of London could not cover those provisions of Part II which would be in contradiction to the principles outlined bove, forming the basis of the contemplated agreement.     This uggestion was accepted without difficulty.     It could not, there-ore, be foreseen on the French side to what objections it would ive rise in Rome when the proposal was communicated to the tali an Government.     It is these objections which have been larified during the meetings of the Drafting Committee and which ve clearly defined the misunderstanding, which underlay the araliel conversations which took place in Rome and in Paris,, this misunderstanding is of a serious character its effect fan at least be very definitely limited.7.     Since the Drafting Committee assembled there have been ee conflicting points of view.8. On the Italian side the Bases of Agreement have been interpreted as excluding all possibility of undertaking before December 31st, 1936, any laying down other than that necessary the construction to be completed before that date, to whichwould
O (TJ0 &amp;would be added the construction authorised under Article 1 of the Treaty of London and that destined for the replacement of pannage becoming overage in 1937, 193S and 1939.9.     On the French side such an interpretation is con-sidered to run counter to the provisions of the final paragraph of the Bases of Agreement, for it implies that a question which K had been agreed to reserve is in fact disposed of, at least for a given period.     The Italian interpretation would in fact prohibit until January 1st, 1937, the laying down of units for the replacement of tonnage remaining overage on December 31st, 1936,     That is to say that this replacement could in no case be effectively begun before January 1st,. 1940, although the last paragraph expressly reserves the conditions, and consequently the date, of this replacement.     For the rest, this interpretation would result in decreasing the average of the construction to be undertaken during six years to a figure very close to that which 3 French Government have always declared would be insufficient ft^r the needs of their navy.10.    Between the two extreme theses Great Britain has finally adopted an intermediate position.     The question should be decided at latest at the Conference which, under the Treaty oil London, is to assemble in 1935. .   In the absence of an agreement at this Conference the Governments would doubtless remain tied until December 31st, 1935, and no construction for the replacement of tonnage remaining overage on that date could be undertaken before January 1st,1937, but it would be for the Confer-entje eventually to consider whether authority could be given for
9 9the laying down of&quot; a certain tonnage in the course of 1936c11a     The&apos; divergence of view Is definite, hut it is concerned with a point which is so precise that a common effort of goodwill should succeed in surmounting the obstacle.12o     The Government of the Republic appreciate the objec-tlon that if; as they believe3 the provisions of the agreement allow France to allocate to herself a supplementary quota of new construction before December 31st, 1936, the agreement would contain an element of uncertainty which would detract from part of the value which it possesses in the eyes of the Italian government     But the Government of the Republic earnestly hope that the Italian Government for their part fully appreciate that the interpretation defended in their name at the Drafting Committee pre-judges, contrary -do the French thesis3 the solution of a question which has been expressly reservedo13o     The problem which must be solved with the co-opera-tion of the British Government is at once to cause this ele-ment of uncertainty to disappear and at the same time to do nothing which would run counter to legitimate interests0     In order to dispose of it by an equitable compromise the Govern-ment of the Republic, confident that their appeal will be heard, has the hpnour to submit to the British and Italian Governments the proposal of which the text is as follows:-14.     &quot;The work of drafting the agreement will be pur-sued &quot;by the experts on the following basis:-n(a) The question of the construction of limitable vessels to be completed before December 31st 3 1936, is settled as laid down in the Bases of Agreement.&quot;(b)
16.     A solution of this kind doubtless calls for certain   concessions on the part of the three interested Governments in respect of the theses to which they have until now subscribed,17.     The Italian Government would be called upon to agree that the provisions of the agreement regulate not allconstruction&quot;(b) In so far as the construction of limitable vessels to be completed only after December 31st, .1936, is concerned, and provided a more general settle-ment is not arrived at at the Disarmament Con-. ference of 1932, there will be no laying down before July 1st, 1935, by which date It will have been possible for the Conference which, under Article 23 of the London Naval Treaty is to assemble in the beginning of that year to give its decision-&quot;On this same date the provisions of the agreement &quot;dealing with the laying down of tonnage will come to an end.&quot;In any event France and Italy will be. able to lay down &quot;as from January 1st, 1934, the replacement tonnage of ships &quot;which will become overage in 1937 and 1938, as well as the &quot;tonnage to be devoted to the completion of the 70,000 tons &quot;of capital ships whose construction is authorised under &quot;Article 1 of the London Naval Treaty,&quot;15.     In other words, the agreement on the construction to be completed before December 31st, 1936, will bear at the same time upon the total construction which can be undertaken before July 1st, 1935*
oconstruction which can he undertaken by the two Governments before December 3ist, 1936, hut only that which would be begur before July 1st, 1935.     In return for this there would be eliminated, as the Italian Government seeks, all uncertainty-as to the total construction which could be undertaken during this period.18.     The French Government, who. -hold the view that the Bases of Agreement did not preclude the laying down as from the middle of 1934 of replacements for tonnage remaining over-age on December 31st, 1935, would be called upon to admit that they could only recover their liberty of action on this point on July 1st, 1935.     They -would therefore tie themselves for a longer period than they had previously accepted.19.     As for the British Government who have never excluded the possibility of the Conference which is to assembl in 1935 taking decisions as to other construction, it is true that under the Treaty of London they are tied in every respect so far as their own construction is concerned, until the end o the year 1936, but they will retain throughout the duration of this Treaty the right of invoking its Article 21.     For the rest, is the danger of seeing Italy and France, who are both tied to the British Empire by such clear bonds of friendship, eventually recovering their liberty of action a few months before the British Government find themselves equally free9 sufficiently serious and are not alternatively the advantages which would on the other hand result from the happy conclusion of the present negotiations sufficiently great, to enable the British Commonwealth of Nations to agree to the solution now Proposed?The
The Government of the Republic are firmly, confident that their appeal will he heard and that the British and Italian Governments, recognising that the proposal made to thorp demands from each of the interested Powers an equitable concession, will allow the negotiations whose happy con-clusion would be so full of promise for the future, to be completed in a spirit of mutual conciliation and good will.
MBMQRANPIM.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have given careful consideration to the memorandum of the 20th instant setting forth the view of the French Govern-ment on the difference of view which has occurred on the naval question and making certain proposals for a settle-ment of the difficulty0His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the clear and courteous manner in which the French point of view on this question has b-een set forth.     They regret, however, that on a number of points their understanding of the position remains at variance with that contained in the memorandums and, before conmenting on the contents of the memorandum itself, they propose to explain as clearly and briefly as possible the point of view which has always been held by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the difference which has arisen^Part III of the London Naval Treaty establisheslimits, which are not to be exceeded on the 31st December1936, in the tonnage of the various categories,.     In orderto attain these levels the method of determining the amountof new construction which is permissible is based upon two main principles dealing with:      -(1) new construction of ships which maybe completed by December 31st, 1936;(2) additional construction for the years 1934. 1935 and 1936. which is to be limited (under the last sentence of Arto 19) to vessels becoming overage in 1937, 1938 and 1939 (i0e0 maximum tonnage which may be under construe-. tion. on December 31stTT?3B&quot;),     The effect of these two stipulations is to limit the amount of tonnage which a contracting party may lay down during the year 1930 to 1936 inclusive.,
Up to a relatively recent date the negotiations with France and Italy have &quot;been conducted on the assumption that these two Powers would, if the negotiations were successful, accede to Part III of the London Treaty, thus automatically limiting their new construction, during the sin years of the Treaty,&quot;   in the same way as the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, the U0S0A0 and Japan have already agreed to do0     In the later stages of the negotiations, account had to he taken of the possibility that a separate agreement might be found a mere convenient method of procedure than actual accession by France and Italy to Part III of the Treaty.     It was how ever never contended that such separate agreement should for this reason, cease to be a counterpart of Part III of the Treaty or to embody the principles mentioned in the preceding paragrapho     The Bases of Agreement accordingly provide in para C (a) (2) that France and Italy should accept those provisions of Part III of the Treaty &quot;which are of general application&apos;^ Amongst these general provisions was mentioned specifically, in the course of the negotiations, the last sentence of Article 19 which, as shown in paragraph    abovo, restrict-; automatically the amount of additional tonnage which a contracting party may have under construction in 1935, thus definitely limiting naval construction for the period ending December 31st, 1936o     Although it was recognised that the last sentence of Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty would require some drafting amendments, the limi-tation in question was clearly understood to have been accepted by the French negotiators, subject to the deci-si6ns of the Conference which, under the Treaty of London,is
is to meet in the year 1935*     So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government were aware, this French reservation in regard to the decisions of the 1935 Conference was made solely with the object of ensuring that that Conference should not he held to he incompetent to consider the replace-ment of the retained overage tonnage.     Up to the time of Mr, henderson&apos;s and Mr. Alexander&apos;s departure from Paris on March 2nd no hint had been received from the French Government that, failing an agreement by the 1935 conference they would consider themselves free to lay down any additional tonnage they thought fit during the years 1955 to 1936*On the contrary atthe discussion on March 1st the French representatives proposed that paragraph C(2) should be amended by the addition of the words underlined so as to read as follows&quot;(2) that they will accept, in so far as they &quot;are concerned, those provisions (of Part III of the &quot;London Naval Treaty) which are of general application &quot;and which do not conflict with the provisions of the &quot;present arrangement&quot;*In advancing their claims to this amendment the French negotiators   represented firstly that there were certain general provisions (such as the division of com-batent vessels into five categories) which were clearly not applicable to the case of France and Italy;    secondly that the last sentence of Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty, if incorporated as it stood into the new agreement, might be held to prejudge the method by which the question of the replacement of retained overage was ultimately to
to be settled by the 1935 Conference, v/hereas the last sentence of the &quot;Bases of Agreement&quot; laid dov/n that no precedent was being created for the final solution of this question.To obviate these two difficulties it was accordingly agreed by the British negotiators, subject to the assent of the Italian Government, to insert the words underlined above.     This addition was not however accepted by the Italian government it is furthermore necessary to bear in mind the following important sentence in paragraph C (b) of the Bases of Agreement:   &quot;No precedent is being created &quot;for the final solution of the question whether, and &quot;if so in what manner, tonnage remaining overage on the &quot;31st DecemberD 1936, may ultimately be replaced&quot;0This sentence relates to overage tonnage the re-placement of which is not provided for in the proposed agreement, and its wording, with the use of the word &quot;ultimately&quot;, creates a clear presumption that a start was not to be made with the replacement of this overage tonnage before December 31st5 1936.Apart, however, from this presumption based on the text itself, it was always clearly understood throughout the negotiations leading up to the&apos; Bases of Agreement thax the question of the replacement of retained overage tonnag was&apos; to be left   over for consideration by the 1935 Con-ference0It was only in the   discussions of the Drafting Committee that it became clear for the first time that the French Government were claiming that the agreement limited
limited only the amount of construction which France and Italy may complete before December 1936, and as leaving open the question of the amount of tonnage which those countries might have under construction on that date.From the above statement it will be seen that His Majesty &apos;s Government are unable to agree with the explanation of the French point of view contained in paragraph 2 to 6 of the French memorandum.     If necessary this will revert in a separate communication to specific statements contained in these paragraphs from which they must dissent, but it is now proposed io coal with paragraphs 14 and 15 of the memorandum.To their great regret His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom find themselves unable to accept these proposals for the following reasons:-(1)   Even as understood by His Majesty&apos;s Government the underage figures resulting from the bases of agreement.&apos; are, in some catagories, considerably in excess of those to which they would have found it possible to agree during the London Naval Conference. Acceptance of these figures in March, 1931, was given solely on account of the high political importance attached to a Franco-Italian Naval Agreement, and on the understanding that no permanent ratio was established. In addition, and in order to overcome certain -   obstacles which had hitherto stood in the way of an understanding, the right of France to retain certain overage tonnage during the period of the agreement was acceptedo     If and v/hen this tonnage were replaced, it would be necessary considerably to increase our tonnage in the cruiser and destroyer categories;accordingly
accordingly it was clearly laid down that the question whether this overage tonnage could he ultimately replaced was specifically reserved,.The French proposals now anticipate the laying down of replacement tonnage for these overage ships in 1935 and 1936c     His Majesty&apos;s Government could not approve an agreement, the obvious effect of which would be to impose upon them the necessity of invoking Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty in order largely to increase the tonnage built and building fixed until 31st December, 1936, by the London Naval treaty(2)     The fact that under an agreement on the lines proposed in the French Memorandum the size of the French building programmes of recent years would be more than maintained in the building pro-grammes of the future constitutes a serious difficulty and might in itself necessitate invocation by His Majesty&apos;s Government of Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty.The French proposal, in fact, gives France an annual construction programme of more than 41,000 tons in the years 1931-1934 inclusive,, and an unknown building programme in the years 1935 and 1936.     This is a larger programme than is being carried out at the present time by any other Power in the world.(3)     Acceptance of the French proposals would seriously prejudice the British position at the 1935 Conference, since France would have a very large tonnage actually under construction and, falling agreement at that Conference, would regain complete freedom of action in respect of new construction^His
7oHis Majesty*s government on the other hand9 would remain bound until 31st December, I938oHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom resire to make it perfectly clear that they are ready to put into the Declarations which have been under consideration by the Drafting Committee the text of the &quot;Bases of Agreement&quot; accepted by them on March 1st last and in particular they abide by the clause which lays down that &quot;no precedent is being created for the final &quot;solution of the question whether, and if so in what &quot;mannert tonnage remaining overage on 31st December, 1936, &quot;may ultimately be replaced&quot;0     In arriving at that agree-merit they went to the utmost limit in concession, and they greatly regret that they cannot now accept a proposal which would result in France attaining a position rela-tively more advantageous in regard to new construction than had been contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government at any time.They remain,, however, prepared to advocate that middle course mentioned in paragraph 10 of the French memorandum which lies betv/een the Anglo-Italian concept tion of the &quot;Bases of agreement and the interpretation which the French Government now invite them to place upon that document.    For this purpose they invite ths French and Italian governments to consider carefully whether a fair solution of the present difficulty could not be reached by incorporating in the proposed Declara-tions the provisions of the last sentence of Article 19 of the Treaty of London in accordance with the foilowing formula 6,; Subject
It&quot;Subject to any further agreement &quot;limiting naval armaments which may &quot;be reached at the General Disarmament &quot;Conference of 19329 or at the Naval &quot;Conference which will take place in &quot;1935 in accordance with Article 23 of &quot;the Treaty of London, the additional &quot;tonnage which France and Italy may lay &quot;down before December 31st, 1956, shall &quot;be the replacement tonnage of vessels &quot;which will become overage in 1937,1933 &quot;and 1939&quot;.This formula makes it clear that, in the words of paragraph 10 of the French memorandum &quot;it would be for &quot;the Conference (of 1935) to consider whether authority &quot;could not be given for the laying down of ascertain &quot;tonnage from 1936 onwards&quot;.     But it is the earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the annual construction accorded to France under the agreement as it stands, which falls short only by 5,000 tons a year of the annual construction contemplated by this country in respect of a much larger fleet, will be found in the end to be sufficient for French needs.
It is the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the French Government by accepting the compromise now proposed, may thus range themselves with the other principal naval Powers in limiting their naval construction and so paving the way for the success of the General Disarmament Conference on which so many hopes are centred,,     If the proposal now made to the French Government may involve a retardation in the rate of naval construction originally contemplated by them this sacrifice together with the similar sacrifices made by the other naval Powers, will set a most valuable example at a time when preparations for the Conference are being undertaken in every capital. They make a most earnest appeal to the Government of the Republic to consider the question in this wider political aspect and so enable the three Powers to reach that friendly settlement for which all have striven so hard.
