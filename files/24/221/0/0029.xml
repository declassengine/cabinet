-S DOOUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY Off -HIS BRITANNIC .MAJESTY&apos;S: &apos;0dvE^KMBITtI ) JDGRET.139(51) . COPY NO:        ^C A B I IT E To THE AMERICAN VISA FEE. Memorandum by the&apos; Xiord: Privy Seal.1.    As my colleagues are aware? I indicated with the assent of the Cabinet  (Cabinet 22(31) Conclusion 14)  in thecourse of the Debate on the Vote of Censure on 16th April,that among the matters which the G-overnnent were consideringas an item in its general unemployment policy was thepossibility of taking more active steps to attract visitorsfrom overseas to this country.2*    I have had a conference with Lord Derby,  Presidentof the Travel Association of Great Britain, on the subject.He and the Association are strongly of the .opinion that  themost Important single step within the sphere of possibleGovernment action in the immediate future would be theabolition or reduction of the fee of 10 dollars now charged -to Americans fer a visa to visit this country.30    This question was brought before the Cabinet earlyIn 1930 on the motion of the Home Secretary (C.P.4l(30)).    Thedecision taken at the time was that  the visa fee should beretained on revenue grounds.    I now wish to urge that thisdecision should be re-considered.4.    I need hardly stress the importance of the contribution which visitors from overseas and in particular American visitorswho spend freely can make to the propperity of a large number ofindustries and services in this country and to its general trade balance.    As an illustration of the potentialities of tourist traffic,  it is estimated that foreign visitors to France spendannually bo two-on  100 mill:,, on and  120 millions.  . The United States Department of Commerce estimates that during the year 1929
American tourists scent over 137,0009 000 dollars in Franc$62 and 403000,000 dollars in Great Britain., Tais tourist traffic isof very considerable importance to Great Britain,, and its development this summer would be of importance in reducing our unemployment figures and in strengthening our national economic position.5o It is,  of course, not possible precisely to evaluate the effect of the visa charge on American tourist traffic with this country.      The following figures suggests however,  that it is a real  deterrent.      In the tourist season April - October, 1930,  228,000 visitors Prom the United States visited Germany and in the year 1930,  300,000 persons from the American Continent visited Prance.,    Germany makes no visa charge and in the press of 1st April it Is announced that the French have abolished their visa charge (where it still operates)  upon foreigners for the forthcoming summer,    During the year 1930, 142,000 Americans from the U.so.0 visited Great Britain.     The American citizen can enter 30 countries free from a visa charge.    Included in the countries which harre abolished the visa deterrent upon tourists are Belgium, Germany, Ital;/, Japan,  Switzerland, and now France.    Even Austria, with all its financial difficulties only charges 4; dollar.    And we ourselves by reciprocal arrangements with Germany, France, Italy, Scandinavia and all tho other ccuntrie in Western hurope impose no visa charge upon their nationals. 6c The German visa fee was withdrawn in 1925.    In thatyear the number of American visitors was only just over 50,000 It rose in 1930 to 228 .,000.    It is  true that there is no proof of any necessary connection between the cancellation of the visa fee and the great increase in American visitors.    But lord Derby and his Executive have clear evidence that our visa charge is a soiirce of intense irritation among america and
causes many of them deliberately to pass our shores and visit Prance.  Germany,  Switzerland and other continental countries without visiting Britain and spending some of their money here. Critical and at times bitter references to the matter have been made in the American press and point is given to this criticism by the fact that Great Britain is the only country of any importance in Europe which maintains this high charge. An extract from an Americannewspaper cn the subject is attached.7. I have looked over the more recent reports by eurpassport control officers on the subject.       Most of these officers,  it is true, declare they have no evidence that the British visa charge of  2 on Americans is an actual deterrent upon their visiting Great Britain.       On the other hand the British Embassy in Washington reports criticism of the visa charge from several consular officers. Mr.  Rule,  (New Orleans.says:    &quot;Independent tourists visiting Europe ....... notinfrequently decide that it is not worth paying $10 to make a short stay in the United Kingdom&quot;.       Mr.  Cable  (Portland) says:    &quot;There have been instances of people saying that they would go direct to Prance avoiding the United Kingdom on account of the visa fee&quot;.      Mr. Watson (Philadelphia)  says: &quot;There can be little doubt that persons visiting Europe on an economic trip occasionally abandon the idea of going to England on account of the visa fee&quot;,8. I understand that the revenue from visa charges for american citizens is about  175,000 a year.      This is a substant-ial sum and the Chancellor has his difficulties and embarrass-ments, but other countries are at the moment making Sicilful and successful efforts to increase their tourist traffic and there
is a clanger lest in this,  as in certain of the other newer industries, we nay (in spite of the attractions of these islands, particularly for American visitors) &quot;be left behind in the race.      The removal of this particular charge would be a real earnest of our intentions to do something practical to encourage visitors from overseas and would be of enormous publicity value in the UVS.A,,      At a time when our older staple industries are faced with a prospect of permanent contraction it is vital that we should do our utmost to stimulate the employing capacity of other industries and services.      I would remind my colleagues in this connection that the hotel, restaurant and club services alone already employ some 350,000 persons - more than are employed directly by the iron and steel industry.S. Other points raised by Lord Derby related to the r&apos;t*ablations as to medical examination of visitors to Great Britain and to the use of the term &quot;alien&quot; at the ports and incertain other connections.      I have made enquiries into these points but am informed that so far as tourists entering Great Britain are concerned,  it can be stated definitely thatit is the general practice not to submit them to medical examination. As regards the use of the offensive term&quot;alien&quot;, arrangements have already been made for the substitution of the words &quot;foreign visitor&quot; in all posters and leaflets in use by the immigration staffs, and a similar change has been or is being made in all notices directing foreign visitors and British subjects to proceed to places of examination at the ports.      I propose to disouss with the Home Secretary the advisability of making these facts more widely known overseas.(Intld)   T.J.sury Chambers, 5th May,  1951.
