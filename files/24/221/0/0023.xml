(T Pf-S^ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S &amp;0V3RNMEHTWCA3IHET     -Tile Mates Cox-it bee .Draft Statement by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Members of the Cabinet are no doubt a&apos;-/are that there has been considerable pressure in the House as the result of which I  arranged,    for the setting up some time ago of an Admiralty Committee to enquire into the conditions attending promotion from the lower deck to commissioned rank.      This Committee, known as the Kates Committee, which was presided over by Vice Admiral Larkon, has now reported and I circulate,  for the information of ray colleagues, the statement which I propose to ma^e  in reply to a Parliamentary Question on the  20th instant,  and also  a more  detailed statement to be nrinted in the official report.A. V. A.So eret. C.P. 123(31)Admiralty. 14.5.31.
As a complete statement on this question would be rather long, I oropose,  with, my Hon. Friend&apos;s permission to describe in general terns the principal features of the new scheme of promotion from the Lower Dec&apos;- which, has been approved by the Board of Admiralty as the result of the Report of the Committee or. the Mate question and to circulate further details in the Official Reoort.In the first place, it has been decided to  drop the title of Mate and to vromote selected candidates from the Lower Doc^ to the rank of   Acting Sub-Lie-.itenar^t and Acting Sub-Lieutenant (E) .The main drawbacks to the existing scheme have proved to be the somewhat high age at which promotion is achieved and the disparity in the qualifications on promotion between the Mates and Officers ex-Cadet.The nev? scheme recommended by the Committee,  and approved by the Admiralty,  will, it is hops d, do a great deal to remove these disabilities for tho se who possess the qualities and application necessary to succeed.By a system of intense tuition,  both in educational and orofessional subjects, in the early years of a young man&apos;s Naval service, it vfill in future be possible for a candidate to reach Commissioned rank in the Executive Branch at about the ago of 21,  and about 22 for Engine Room Artificers and rather over 25 for Stokers.      These ages comnare favourably with the ages of officers ex-Cadet.The time now spent at Greenwich College by Mates of the Executive Branch is three months only.      In future there will be a preliminary cwurse at the College of three months, to be followed by the full Sub-Lieutenant&apos;s course of 6 months. It is hoped by this extra time to enable these Sub-Lieutenants to compete successfully with other Sub-Lieutenants, both in their examinations for Lieutenant and subsequently In selection for specialisation.     The course for the Engineering Branch will remain as at present-
-2-I must add that the Board have riot overlooked the desire of other Branches for early promotion to Commissioned rank&apos;,&apos; hut, after full consideration of their  claims, they have reluctantly come to the conclusion that such a system is not needed in the Navy and that the present scheme of promotion at a later age through the  grade of Warrant Rank sufficiently meets requirements both of the    Service   and the Branches
(To be printed in the Official Report-)The following aro the salient points in the new scheme for tho promotion of officers from the Lower; Deck.It has been decided   to   drop the title of Mate and&apos; make use of the ordinary title of Sub-Lieutenant-for officers promoted from the Lower Deck.. Sub-Lieutenants (Exe executive.)Boys In.the Training Establishments and seagoing ships who show exceptional promise, and Ordinary Seamen who pass exceptionally well through . the Ordinary Seaman training classes and are well fitted in other respects, will be given special opporttuilties of rendering themselves eligible for selection for Acting Sub-Lieutenant.They will be drafted to capital  ships and large cruisers only-, so that all may have equal opportunities of . advancing in their profession.It will &quot;be possible for the rating of&apos; Able - Seaman to be reached after a minimum of 12 months&apos; as Ordinary Seaman&apos; instead of 15 months as at present,  and thereafter every encouragement will be given&apos; for - such young Able Seamen to pass for Leading Seamen-.      Opportunities .will- be afforded to such of them as are candidates for a Commission to obtain the lattery-rate at the ag of 19s at the earliest.      On being rated. Acting Leading Seamen , they will be  sent to another ship to do Leading Seaman&apos;s dutiesAfter1&quot;not lesc than - 6 months as Acting Leading Seaman and at a minimum age of 20-g-, .a candidate for a Commission, if recommended by his Commanding Officer and provided he has passed the Qualifying professional and educational examinations will be eligible to present himself before a Fleet Selection. Bo All candidates recommended for Commissions by the- Fleet Select! Boards will subsequently be discharged to their Depots and be assembled as a class at Devonport IT aval Barracks to go through a modified Petty Officers&apos;  Course;    on joinincr this class to be rated Acting    Petty Officer.      Those not recommended for aCommission   /
Gprmul.ssi.on will, bo - confirmed as Leading Seamen if recommended by their Commanding Officer.On completion of this course candidates will appear before  a final Selection Board of Naval Officers at Bevonport Barracks.      Thos who  are   selected by this Board will be appointed Acting Sub-Lieutenants.      The minimum  age at which this rank can be obtained will be about   21.    Tboje who fail will be confirmed as Petty Officers in due course, If recommended by their Commanding Officer.Those Acting Sub-Lieutenants will then join the Royal Naval College,  Greenwich,   and for one term will form a class by themselves, receiving special tuition.      At the end of this term they will  join up with the ordinary Acting Sub-Lieutonarts for the two terms prescribed and thereafter will undergo the same courses and pass tho samo examinations for the rank of Lieutenant. iOn finishing their courses they  vd.ll be confirmed  as Sub-Lieutenant and be   sent to big ships whore,  as at present, they will join the Wardroom Mess.      Their seniority as Sub-Lioutenant will &quot;be calculated on the  same basis as applies to other Sub-Lieutenant3 .The pay of these officers from the data of being rated Acting Sub-Lieutenant will be the  same as for officers ox-Cadet, but their uniform grant of  150 will bo continued. Sub-Lieut en ants (Bngineeri ng) .In view of the age on going to sea of ratings in the Engineering    Branch, it -will be impossible to regulate tho ago on promotion to    Acting Sub-Lieutenant  (E)  so as to  be as low as in the Executive Branch.      This applies especially to the case of Stokers.      The arrangements to be made will, however, enable an Engine Room   Artificer to  reach the rank of Acting Sub-Lieutenant  (E)  at a minimum age of 22,  or about a year, later than in the Executive Branch.      In the  case of Stokers,  who haveto    /
to pass through the Mechanician grade, the minimum age will he rather over 25.Candidates for commissions In the Engineering Branch will appeal&apos; before Fleet Selection Boards and a final Selection Board as in the case of the Executive Branch.      Those that- are appointed Acting Sub-Lieutenant (E) will then take the year&apos;s course at Greenwich College as at present, receiving the same pay and counting time  for promotion in the same manner as an ordinary Acting Sub-Lieutenant (E) , but retaining, their present uniform grant.iOn completion of their ccurse they will be confirmed as Sub-Lieutenant (E) and be sent to sea, joining the Wardroom Me ss.
