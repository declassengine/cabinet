Recent Experience in Germany.Copy of Despatch. No. 323 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin.(Circtdated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the request of theLord President of the Council.)Sir, Berlin, May 1, 1931.SINCE Dr. Briining&apos;s Government assumed office repeated attempts, as you are aware from my despatches, have been made to assist German agriculture. , These efforts were made partly out of sympathy with the plight of the farmers and partly to redeem pledges given at one time&apos;by the President and at another by the Government. Agricultural interests were prodigal of promises that the imposition of duties and the adoption of such measures as the compulsory admixture of home-grown flour would not materially affect the cost of food-stuffs.2. The Government began by attempting to ensure that the farmer should receive a fair price for his rye. I do not propose to enter into the details of this experiment. It failed for a variety of reasons, after costing the Government a sum variously estimated at between 30 and 50 millions of marks and is now the subject of a Reichstag committee of enquiry. From the evidence before the committee the task of manipulating rye prices resembles a game of poker between the consumer, the baker, the miller, the middle-man, the farmer and the Government. Everybody is allowed to cheat, except the Government, and at various stages wholesale rye-dealers take a hand and usually annex the pool, whereupon the game starts again with fresh stakes provided by the Government.3. Having embarked on the problem of rye, it was only natural that wheat interests should persuade the Government that it was now the turn of wheat. The Government thereupon agreed to help the farmer to get a fair price for his wheat. Taught caution by their rye experiment, they &quot;confined themselves to raising the duty on wheat. Whenever they raised the duty the world-price promptly fell, and the whole machinery had to be set in motion again. Fresh deputations from the farmer, fresh promises by the Minister of Food, fresh Cabinet meetings and finally a further increase in the duty. Finally, at the end of March, before the Reichstag adjourned, Herr Schiele, the Minister of Agriculture, succeeded in passing an Enabling Bill entitling the Government to adjust the tariff on wheat and other food-stuffs to suit the needs of the moment.4. This would have been all very well if the Government had not again taken the agricultural interests at their word. The farmers and Herr Schiele told them that sliding duties on rye and wheat could be imposed without unduly increasing the price of bread. Not only did the Government believe that it was possible for Herr Schiele to solve the problem of having one&apos;s cake and eating it, but they embodied their conviction in the Bill. Article 1 of the Enabling Act under reference states that no increase in the price of bread over and above the average price of that commodity during the preceding six months was to result from the measures contemplated in the Bill. An awkward position has now arisen. For, in response to repeated increases in the duty, the price of flour has gone up and bread has suddenly become dearer by 2 pfennigs than it hasbeen for a year.........................................................^_________________________^[5503]
5. On returning to work a week ago the Chancellor, instead of finding himself free, as he hoped to, set to work on his big programme of permanent financial and social reform, found angry deputations on his doorstep. All those sections of the agricultural community not engaged in the cultivation of rye and wheat had come to complain that the increased cost of grain interfered- with their business, and they demanded their share, of help in the shape of Increased duties on butter, bacon, cheese, geese, beans, &amp;c. Herr Schiele, as spokesman of the agricultural interests, supported these demands, and the Government proceeded to consider them.6. At the same time powerful deputations representative of all the German trades unions came to draw Dr. Bruning&apos;s attention to the increase in the price of bread and the breach of the Government promise. The Chancellor held a Cabinet meeting and Herr Schiele was asked to explain why bread had suddenly become 2 pfennigs dearer in the middle of April and what he proposed to do about it. In such cases a Minister of Food can safely put the blame on the millers and bakers. But as ill-luck would have it the leader of that very troublesome party, the Economic party, Herr Drewitz, is a baker by trade, and moreover has the figures of baking and milling at his fingers&apos; ends. Forced to find a fresh explanation the Minister pointed to the increased charges of the public utility services in the hands of the local authorities, water, electricity, transport, &amp;c. But he was confident that he could reduce the price of bread and keep it down to the desired level in spite of his duties, if only he could be allowed to make a &quot; trifling alteration in the quality of the loaf.&quot;7. This brought the leaders of the Social Democratic party on the scene. Dr. Breitscheid, Dr. Hilferding and Dr. Herz interviewed Dr. Bruning on the 129th April and told him firmly that the working-classes were not prepared to go back to the sawdust and potato loaf of 1917, and that they were not prepared to put up with a reduction in wages, further encroachments on the social services, and an increase in the cost of bread at one and the same time. Dr. Bruning is understood to have promised to abide by the undertaking given in the law of 28th March.8 The Cabinet are now considering a drastic reduction in the duty oh cereals for some half a million or million tons in order to bring down the price of flour. But experience has shown that considerable time elapses before practice follows theory and before the effect of the duty is visible on the breakfast table. The Communist and Social Democratic parties are therefore considering the advisability of summoning the Reichstag. As the Social Democratic party convention is fixed for the first week in June, their leaders must be particularly cautious in the meantime. So, too, must Dr. Bruning, because the two parties of the Left command a majority in the Reichstag, unless Hugenberg and Hitler return to the fold and help the Government.9. The Government, it is announced to-day, have decided to raise the duties on pigs, geese, beans and a variety of other products for the next six months in order&quot; to assist the small farmer. The official communique contains the usual solemn undertakings to protect the consumer and prevent an unfair increase in the price of bread.10. Up till now the Government have fallen between two stools, or rather between several stools, in their food tariff policy. They have not gone far enough to please anybody, and so far from obtaining the political support of the agrarian interests, they have failed completely to arouse the slightest sympathy among the landowners. Throughout the winter session of the Reichstag the Minister for Agriculture sat on the Government bench while his own immediate followers, not to mention the other parties of the Right, recorded their votes time after time against the Government. The Federation of German Industries has now lodged a fresh formal protest against the new duties, while, as I pointed out above, the Communists have made common cause with the Socialists in their resistance to food tariffs.I have, &amp;c.HORACE RUMBOLD.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 27, 1931.
