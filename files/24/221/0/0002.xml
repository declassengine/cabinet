(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. ) SECRET. 0 A 3 I N E To&apos;CS._S_J.3l) .3. , s COPY NO.&quot; COAL MINES (MINIMUM WAGS) ACT,  1912.Proposals for an amending Bill put forward by the Miners&apos;  Federation and the Miners&apos; group in the House of Commons.Memorandum by the Secretary for /fines.On the 20th April,  at the invitation of the Miners&apos; Federation,  I received a deputation jointly representative of the Federation and of the Miners&apos; Members cf Parliament. Mr. Richards, on behalf of the deputation then outlined their new proposals, and during the discussion that followed I was handed a written summary of these proposals, a copy of which is attached as an appendix to this memorandum.      I should make it clear that this was the first time that these proposals were submitted to me.        In the circumstances I did not make - and, of course, could not have made - any comment upon such far-reaching proposals.      I limited myself to eliciting the facts and the intentions of the Federation and undertook to submit them to the Cabinet, and to report the request of the deputation for &quot;urgent emergency legislation&quot; on these lines.Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act,  1912. As the present proposal is an amendment of the 1912 Act, it may be of assistance if I give a brief account of that Act.It was originally passed for three years, and has since been renewed (by the Expiring laws Continuance Act)  from year to year. The original object of the agitation which led up to the passing of the Act was to secure a minimum cash wage per shift for all piece-workers,  and thus to do away with the unsatisfactory
local bargaining which had hitherto been the only method of dealing with the problem of piece workers who were prevented, because of &quot;aba-urmal&quot; conditions or other difficulties,  from earning reasonable wages at the ordinary tonnage or price list rateso    This claim, however, was later enlarged,  and became a claim for &quot;an individual district minimum wage for all men and &quot;boys &quot;working in mines .  .  .  without any reference to the working-plaec being abnornial&quot;.Section l(i) ef the Act expressly provides that &quot;it shall been implied term of every contract for the employment of a workman underground in a coal mine that the employee shall pay to that workman wages at rot less than the minimum rate settled und^r this Act&quot;.The Act therefore provided a statutory guarantee of a minimum cash wage to each individual underground workman.    But it is important to note that the Act did not specify what these minimum rates were to be, nor did it provide for the minimum rates to oe uniform all over the country.    Efforts were made by the workmen to secure provision in these directions, but the Government definitely refused.The Act provided for machinery to settle the statutory minimum rates for each district (22 districts altogether - Kent not included, as it was not wor-xing then).    / Joint District Board was to be set up for each district, with an independent Chairman, who was to give ; decisions in cases where the two sides failed to agree.    These Boards were to settle separately for each of the Districts the minimum rates of wages and the district rules for the purposes of the Act:    and in settling such rates the Board concerned was to &quot;have regard t,p the average daily rate of wages paid to the workmen of. the class for which the minimum rate is to &quot;tee settled&quot;.    It is in these two respects the proposed amending Bill differs fundamentally from the 1912 Act,
-a-The minimum rates laid down by these Boards immediately alter the passing of the Act - in every case by the independent Chairmen - were effective up to 1914 cr a little later; but with the  changed economic  conditions since the War they have been largely superseded in practice by the minimum rates fixed in the various district rage agreements.    The machinery, however, regains in existence, and has in fact been used recently in Nottinghamshi re.The District Board (or the  Chairman)  can fix the minimum rate per shift for each class of underground labour and make rules  as to the conditions Tinder which this statutory minimum should be paid.    Any minimum rate, or.the district rules5  can be varied -(a) at any tire .- by agreement between the two sides of the Board;(b) after one year from the previous settlement or variation.;  on three months&apos; notice given by either side.The Miners&apos; New proposals. These are set out in detail (in the form in which they were supplied to me) in the Appendix.    It has not been possible in the ti-ie at my disposal to examine or deal with them in detail, and at the moment I can only draw attention to some salient point.(a) The 1915 Act 9 which at present applies only ,tp. underground workmen:  is to be extended to cover all workmen.The differentiation between surfacemen and underground men (there is no statutory regulation of the hours of surfacemen either) has been aue5 broadly speaking,  to a recognition that underground men, owing to the specially arduous and unpleasant conditions under which they work, are entitled to special treatment
(b) The minimum -gages to be set tied under the amended Act are to be ;int less than the ff^es4- prevailing in July. 1914, plus 3  percentage thereon (at the moment 47:o) equivalent to the percentage increase in the cost of living; since that tine .(c) The percentage addition so fixed is to be adjusted periodically in accordance with the cost of living index figure.It will be seen that these proposals involve a fundamental departure from the principle of the 1912 Act, which provided for the fixing of minimum rates for each district )ty the district hoard (or the independent Chairman), having regard to the average daily rate of wages paid in the district to the workmen of each class.    Secondly, it introduces an entirely new criterion to the machinery of wage-determinetion, in regulating the wages of a large body of workmen without regard to the industry&apos;s capacity to pay.    It is trie that the existing &apos;subsistence tence &quot; wages do to some extent take into account factors outside the purely economic position of the industry;    but these wages like others are determined for each district separately, end vary considerably district by district.,    i-ioreover,  the governing consideration, even in the case of &quot;subsistence1&apos; wage, is the economic position in the district    as a whole.    It might, &apos; for example, be found necessary in a particular district, in order to maintain the subsistence wage at a certain level, to reduce the general district percentage on basis rates.y;: ;-l.r*   The deputation stated that by &apos;&apos;Y/ages&quot; they referred to /average wages for each class of workmen,./I ()I iii&apos;
(d) In addition to the minimum shift wage, minimum weekly earnings ( 2 in the case of datal workers, and  2.10/- in the case of pieceworkers) is to he guaranteed to every adult worker who has worked the full number of shifts available for him during: the week. A statutory minimum weekly wage would be an entirely new principle not only in mining legislation but in any legislation.      &quot;where a guaranteed weekly wage does exist,  it does so as the result of agreement between employer and employed.I questioned the deputation specifically on this proposal and they replied that it was the intention that an owner should be legally compelled to pay these weekly minima,  to whatever extent his pit was laid idle in any week, (e),  [f) and  (g)   (See Appendix)ihe three remaining proposals are of comparatively minor importance, and in the interests of brevity I propose not to deal with them in this note.I may, perhaps, add that I asked the deputation what relation their proposals bore to the question of working hours. Their reply was that it was their intention that the new minimum daily and weekly wages should apply &quot;irrespective of working hours&quot;.The deputation also asked (though the proposal is not included in their written draft) that the 1912 Act should be further amended with a view to replacing the independent Chairmen of the Minimum Wages Boards, as the court of appeal in cases where the two sides fail to agree in fixing minimum wages, by the Coal Mines National Industrial Board.x      The National Board was never, of course,  intended to perform functions of this kind.      As at present constituted,  it has no official representatives of the Coal Owners, (who declined to participate in it), and possesses no compulsory powers whatever.x Set up under Part IV. of the Coal Mines Act,  1930, for purposes connected with that Act.R.67.
