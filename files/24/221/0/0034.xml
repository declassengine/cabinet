Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieson the alterations made in the Bill by the House of Lorda.1.     As received back from tne Lords, the original part I has been removed from the Bill and a number of Important alterations have been made in Part II.    It will be convenient to consider these amendments seriatim.PART   I.Large Scale Farming and Demonstration Farms.2a     Those proposals formed the subject of the original Clauses 1 and 2 respectively.    Both these Clauses were deleted by the Lords during Committee stage without any amendments having been made.   The ultimate object of these clauses was to ascertain by actual exporintent, under the most efficient and progressive management, ?rtiat can be done to adapt farming in Great Britain to present economic conditions.   Although these proposals have met with considerable opposition they have attracted a measure of independent support.    In my opinion a vigorous effort should be made to secure the passing into law of both these clauses. Re-conditioning of Neglected Land.3.     This proposal formed the subject of Clause 3.   although the Bill has been returned to the Commons without this Clause, the Lords, after making certain amendments (to the most important of which I refer later), passed the Clause in Committee by 75 votes to 17.    It was deleted on Report stage on the motion of Lord Hailsham for tactical reasons which it is desirable to explain.   He expressed the opinion that in the Commons some of the most important of their amendments to the Clause might bo objected to as a breach of privilege, in which case the House of Lords would not be able to insist on their amendments.    On the other hand, he explained,
It would not be a breach of privilege&quot; for the House of lords to reject the Clause as a whole.   Lord H allaham - also-exp rea a edthe view that there was some doubt as to whether the House ofLords was entitled to delete, as they had, already done,Clause 1 and 2 of the Bill but that there could be no doubt-about their right to omit the whole of Part 1*   Clauses 3, 4 Iand 5 had, therefore, in his view better be deleted in orderto make quite sure that the commons could not claim that theremoval of Clauses 1 and 2 by themselves had been a breach of privilege.   Clause 3 was, therefore, removed during Report(In spite of the large vote in its favour in Committee) on grounds which were but remotely related to the merits of the Clause itself.4.     The alterations which were made in Committee in the Lords to Clause 3 varied greatly In their Importance.The Clause In its original form gave the; Minister power to acquire land by voluntary agreement if, In order to enable a pieoe of land to be satisfactorily used for agricultural purposes, the execution thereon of reclamation, drainage or other work was necessary.    The Clause also dealt with the case of land which was in a seriously neglected condition due to the failure of the owner to execute any works of maintenance necessary to enable the land to be satisfactorily used for agricultural purposes.   During Committee Stage in the House of Lords, amendments were inserted with the object of reducing the scope of both parts of this Clause but It is probable that adjustments could be effected in regard to many of the points in dispute.5.     One amendment, however, will certainly have to be resisted, as it involves the confidential report of the Ministry&apos;s officer (a privileged document) becoming the chief evidence in an arbitration and also removes from the Minister the responsibility for the work of his officers.* An appendix on the question of privilege, prepared by Parliamentary Counsel, is attached,
6*    An important alteration to Clause 3 wa^^adopted on the suggestion, of Lord Lothian, i.e., that the Minister should be empowered to enter into partnership or make advances to public authorities or private corporations or individuals for the purpose of ensuring the execution of works of reclamation. My impression is that this addition was adopted tentatively so as to give the Government an opportunity of considering it.    If the acceptance by the Government of the principle of this Amendment were likely to reconcile critics to the Clause there might be some advantage in considering whether, notwithstanding its obvious objections some concession could not be made along the lines proposed,   in my opinion, however, the proposal is not likely to meet with much support from any quarter. Remainder of Part I.7.     The remaining Clauses of Part I, namely Clauses 4 and 6, were consequential upon clauses 1 to 3.   if clauses 1, 2 or 3 are reinstated, Clauses 4 and 5 will also have to be reinstated.   These two Clauses raise no question of principle.PART II. [Small Holdings and Allotments.8.     Three changes of a vital character were made by the House of Lords in the small holdings provisions of the Bill, whloh are explained in paras. 9, 10 and 11.9.     A proviso was inserted (Page 2, Clause 1 lines 4 to 10*) which will prevent the Minister providing any holding for an unemployed person or an agricultural worker unless the Council of the County report to the Minister in writing In respect of each holding that a person possessing, in the opinion of the Minister, the necessary qualifications may reasonably be expected to earn a livelihood on that holding-   Tho proviso would made the small holdings provisions of the Bill unworkable and must be resisted at all costsa* Bill as returned to the Commons, No.84.
10.   The Bill, as originally drafted, in addition to giving the Minister power to provide small holdings for unemployed persons, enabled him by Clause 10 under certain prescribed conditions to provide small holdings for the ordinary County Council applicants, who were not unemployed persons, in those areas where the County Council are either unable or unwilling to satisfy the requirements of suitable applicants.   The   House of Lords in Committee Stage deleted the Clause altogether on the ground that if a County Council is not providing applicants with holdings, it may safely be assumed that the County Council has some very good reason for not doing so, and, therefore, there is no reason why the Minister should act In default of such Council.   This argument is, however, quite contrary to the facts of the situation.   A considerable number of counties have failod to provide any small holdings during the last four or five years in spite of the fact that the land in the county is thoroughly suitable and that there is a demand from applicants approved by the Council itself who if given the opportunity would undoubtedly prove successful.    In my view, the Bill will be both incomplete and open to serious criticism if it contains no provision for assisting the ordinary County Council applicant who is suitable in areas where, at present, he is denied access to land.11.   The House of Lords also inserted a time limit of four years so far as the provisions of the Bill relating to small holdings and allotments (as distinct from allotment gardens) are concerned (Clause 15).   Such a short time limit as four years is ridiculous. In most cases twelve months9 notice is required after land which is occupied by a tenant has been purchased before vacant possession can be obtained,    in any case, it would be impracticable to engage the professional and technical staff necessary for the work involved if
it were known at the outset that the programme was restricted by Statute to a period of four years.   A time limit of some kind is not, in itself/ unreasonable in order to give Parliament an opportunity of taking stock of the situation and deciding whether the results obtained justify further efforts and expenditure and I refer to this point in the recommendations.12.   The Lords have also Inserted a financial limit of ten million pounds as the maximum amount of capital expenditure which can be borrowed for the provision of small holdings by the Minister and a similar limit of  750,000 has been inserted so far as the Department of Agriculture for Scotland is concerned.  (Clause 18(1)). These amendments are clearly a breach of privilege of the House of Commons,  and should, I suggest, be rejected on this ground-13.   A new Clause has been inserted, the effect of whxch is to amend the law which has been in operation since 1908 with regard to the procedure under which County Councils have acquired compulsorily land required for small holdings.    (Clause 13).   The provision of the Small Holdings Act of 1908 (i.e. that a compulsory-order after confirmation by the Minister cannot be challenged in a Court of Law) which the House of Lords desire to repeal, may be open to criticism on theoretical grounds.    The fact is, however, that the provision ha3 been on the Statute Book for 23 years and has worked well,   end there is no evidence that it has caused injustice to anyone.    It is one of the cases to which attention was called by Lord Hewart in &quot;The Kew Despotism&quot; and will,  therefore, be reported upon by the Committee of which Lord Donoughmore is the Chairman.    In these circumstances, it is not unreasonable to Insist that the House of Lords should wait for the report of the Donoughmore Committee,  and not take the opportunity of this Bill to amend the law in the manner suggested.
14.    The only other amendment to the small holding provisions of the Bill to which it Is necessary to refer is one which raises the question of the privilege of the House of Commons and was carried by the House of Lords on the motion of Lord Astor.    It will be remembered that the Bill as originally Introduced into the House of Commons contemplated the provision of special financial facilities restricted to unemployed persons to enable them to cultivate small holdings.    In the House of Commons agricultural workers were put on the same footing as unemployed persons.    In the House of Lords an applicant who is or has been a member of His Majesty&apos;s Forces and has had a suitable course of training for agriculture was added to the two f oiimei* categories.    Provided that the number of men serving with the Colours isho are trained for agriculture does not become excessive, I do not see any serious objection to this addition to the Bill.    It is, however, a matter for consideration whether the House of Commons should be asked to concur in the limited number of Service applicants who have received training in agriculture being placed in this preferential position.REG OaKhiEDAT IONS. 15.    In view of the drastic treatment which the Bill has received in the House of Lords, the Government would be justified in asking the House of Commons to reject the whole of the House oX&quot; Lords amendments, send the Bill back in the form in which it was originally sent to the House of Lords and make it clear- that, failing acceptance by the Lords, it is the Governments intention to place the Bill on the Statute Book under the provisions of the Parliament Act.    The objection to this course is that, if it is followed, nothing can be done in the way of providing unemployed persons with access to land for three years.\
I do not, therefore, favour the adoption of this course. I recommend that the Government should ask the House of Commons to consider each of the Lords&apos; amendments separately, and where the alteration is not objectionable to accept it or to amend their amendments.   7/lth a view to facilate subsequent negotiations I do not suggest that the Commons be asked to reinstate Part I en bloc but that each Clause I to 5 be discussed separately, and in the case of Clause 3 some of the minor amendments made in the Lords during Committee stage might be adopted.16. The debates in the House of Lords have, on the whole,shown less opposition to the objects of the Biil than their treatment of the Bill itself might lead one to suppose.   It may, therefore, be assumed that if certain concessions are made, the bulk of the Bill would be passed by the House of Lords during this Session in a form which would not hamper its subsequent administrations    I am inclined to think, for example, that a time limit of ten or even fifteen years for the small holdings and allotments clauses of the Bill might be accepted by the House of Lords once they recognised that on no account would the Government accept a money limit. It may be that in the last resort for the purpose of saving the remainder of the Bill, we may have to consider whether we shall adhere to Clause 1 (large scale farming) in the form in which it left the House of Commons on 11th Pebruaxy (Bill Ho.43) or accept some modification, but I consider that we should make every effort to retain this Clause.17. On the whole, therefore, I recommend that -(i) the House of Commons should be asked to reinstate Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill and also Clause 3, but with certain minor amendments;
(II) the House of Commons should be asked to reject the amendments to the small holdings and allotment provisions to which I have drawn attention in paragraphs 9 to 13 of this Memorandum;    and(iii) I should make use of a suggestion of negotiations that has been privately made to explore the possibility of agreement.(Initialled) CA.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 4th June,  1931.
Agricultural Land (Utilisation)Bill.NOTE BY PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL ON THE QUESTION OF COMMONS PRIVILEGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LORDS AMENDMENTS.1. It will be convenient that I should first point Preliminary, out that the initiative in regard to Lords amendments affecting the privileges of the House of Commons rests not with the Government but with Mr. Speaker.No motion is made in the Commons either on behalf of the Government or otherwise to the effect that the House waives its privileges. The procedure is as follows : Upon a Lords amendment coming up for consideration by the Commons, if Mr. Speaker is of opinion that the amendment infringes the privileges of the Commons, he directs the attention of the House to the fact, and thereupon the Member in charge of the Bill moves (just as in other cases where no question of privilege arises) either that the House do agree with the Lords amendment or that the House do not agree, or that the House suggests an alternative or further amendment.If the House agrees to a Lords amendment with regard to which Mr. Speaker has pointed out that it infringes the privileges of the Commons, Mr. Speaker directs a &quot; special entry&quot; to be made in the Commons&apos; journals.2. Although  the  clauses  originally  contained  in r^he 4mend-Part I of the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill clearly ment to dealt with &quot; charges upon the people &quot; yet the Lords leave out amendment to leave out that Part from the Bill does not, Part I. in my opinion, infringe the privileges of the House of Commons, and, therefore though the question of course entirely depends on what view Mr. Speaker takes I should not anticipate that the question of privilege will133-2 A
be raised in the Commons in connection with this amend-ment.It appears to be unquestionable that the claim of privilege cannot be raised by the Commons regarding amendments whereby a whole clause or series of clauses concerning a subject &quot; separable from the general objects of the Bill &quot; are omitted by the Lords, and, in my opinion, this amendment is an amendment to omit three such subjects, namely : (i) the  establishment  of the Agricultural Land Corporation;(ii) the power of the Minister to establish demonstra-tion farms; and(iii) the power of the Minister to re-conditioil land;for, in my view, each of these subjects, although of course originally included in the general objects of the Bill, are separable from those objects. It might perhaps be argued that the three subjects mentioned - above formed so important a part of the objects of the Bill as it left the Commons that none of them can be regarded as &quot; separable from the general objects of the Bill,&quot; but I think such an argument would be beside the point, for, as I understand the position, it makes no difference to the question of privilege whether or not the provisions left out by the Lords amendment were important objects of the original Bill. The Lords&apos; right to omit provisions creating charges upon the people does not appear to rest upon the comparative importance of the provisions respectively omitted or retained, but the basis seems rather to be that this right of the Lords follows from their right to reject a Bill, even though it were a Bill which it would be out of their power to amend. The test seems to be, therefore, whether the subject or subjects omitted by the Lords are simply omissions leaving the remainder of the Bill complete in itself and unchanged by the omission, in so far as that remainder deals with subjects other than those omitted.The relevant passage in May&apos;s Parliamentary Practice (13th Edn., p. 575) is as follows : &quot; The right of the Lords to reject a bill for granting aids and supplies to the Crown has been held to include a right to omit provisions creating charges upon the people, when such provisions form a separate subject in a bill which the Lords are otherwise entitled to amend. The claim of privilege cannot, therefore, bo raised by the Commons regarding amendments to
such bills, whereby a whole clause, or series of clauses, lias been omitted by the Lords, which, though relating to a charge, and not admitting of amendment, yet concerned a subject separable from the general objects of the bill. On the 30th July, 1807, it was very clearly put, by Earl Grey and Viscount Eversley, that the right of the Lords to omit a clause, which they were unable to amend, relating to a separate subject, was equivalent to their right to reject a bill which they could not amend without an infraction of the privileges of the Commons.&quot;The speeches by Lord Grey and Lord Eversley referred to in the above passage were delivered in con-nection with the Representation of the People Bill, 1867, and the germane passages from those speeches are set out in the Appendix to this Note, together with a passage from the speech of Lord Harrowby. It should be noted that Lord Eversley spoke upon this subject with the authority. of one who had but recently ceased to be Speaker of the House of Commons.It may be of interest to add that research into the precedents with regard to this matter is rendered more difficult by the fact that the question being entirely one for Mr. Speaker, the matter has never been debated in the House of Commons.3. The first Lords amendment takes the form of Possibilityleaving out the whole of Part I, but this does not mean of dealingthat on the consideration of this Lords amendment the separatelywhole of that Part must be dealt with by the&quot; Commons w     ,*j several Iin the same way.   As explained in the last preceding ciausos 0f paragraph of this Note, the effect of this amendment Part I. is to omit three distinct and separable subjects, and it will be open to the House of Commons, if that House so decides, to deal differently with respect to each of these subjects.The method by which this could be done is best shown by an illustration which, of course, in no way implies any anticipation as to what decisions as to policy may ultimately be made by the Government.If, for instance, it were decided to restore clauses 1 and 2 as they originally left the Commons, but to accept some or all of the amendments to clause 3 made by the Lords at the Committee stage in that House, the pro-cedure would be to move that -&quot; The Commons disagree to the Lords amendment to leave out Part I, but propose to amend the words so restored to the Bill as follows :  [Here would follow the amendments to clause 3 made in Committee by the Lords, or such of them as it was decided to agree to.]&quot;
-    2S8As to the remainder of the Lords amend-ments.If this were the message brought from the Commons to the Lords, it would still be open to the Lords to propose further amendments, e.g., to leave out clause 1, but to agree to the restoration of the remainder of Part I as proposed to be amended by the Commons.4. I do not anticipate that the question of privilege will be raised with respect to any of the other Lords amendments except the following : (i) Page 13, line 2, at end, insert (&quot; or who being or having been a member of His Majesty&apos;s Forces, has had a suitable course of training for agri-culture &quot;) :(ii) Page 19, line 36, at end, insert new clause B :(iii) Page 20, line 33, at end, insert -(&quot; (2) No compensation shall be payable under section forty-three of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, or under the foregoing provisions of this section, to any person for whom a small holding is provided under Part III of this Act.&quot;) :(iv) Page 21, line 18, after (&quot;sums&quot;) insert (&quot;not exceeding in the aggregate ten million pounds &quot;) :(v) Page 21, line 25, after (&quot;sums&quot;) insert (&quot;not exceeding in the aggregate seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds &quot;) :(vi) Pages 23, 24, 25 and 26, certain corresponding amendments relating to Scotland.As to the Lords amendment numbered (iii) above, this was a Government amendment and is really purely drafting. Presumably, therefore, the Commons will agree and a &quot; special entry &quot; will be made to the effect that the amendment is agreed to on the ground that it carries out the intention of the Commons.It will be noted that I have not included among the amendments with regard to which questions of privilege may be expected to arise the Lords amendment to leave out clause 10 : this is upon the ground that that amendment is, in my view, an amendment to reject a &quot; separate subject&quot; and, therefore, the same considerations apply to it as have been explained with regard to the amendment to leave out Part I.Treasury Chambers.gbanville pvam.3rd June, 1931.
APPENDIX.On the Committee stage in the House of Lords of the Representation of the People Bill in 1867, Lord Grey moved the omission of clause 7 (which provided that the occupier was to be rated in boroughs and not the owner).The following passages from Hansards Parliamentary Debates, 3rd series, vol. 189, cols. 412 to 417, deal with the right of the Lords to omit provisions which they would not have power to amend : &quot; the duke of richmond : ... In Mr. May&apos;s work on Parliamentary Practice it was laid down that in Bills of this kind their Lordships could make any amendment provided that they did not alter the intentions of the other House with regard to the amount of rate or charge, the various modes of levy and assessment, or the persons who should pay, receive, manage, or control such assessment. Assuming that the doctrine was correct, their Lordships would find, on referring to the 7th clause, that where the owner was rated to the poor rate at the time of passing this Act the occupier&quot; was to be rated instead. That was to say, the House of Commons decided by this clause that the owner, who now paid, should no longer pay the rate. Now, if you altered the incidence of taxation under this clause, putting on the back of the occupier the burden now borne by the owner, their Lordships would interfere with that incidence of taxation which, according to the doctrine laid down by Mr. May, they were incompetent to deal with. In that case they could not deal with the clause in any manner whatever.the earl of haeeowby : As to the right of their Lordships to touch this clause, suppose it had formed a separate Bill, would their Lordships have been entitled to reject it ? [the lord Chancellor (Lord Chelmsfnrd) : You may reject it, but you cannot amend it.] The amend-ment of the noble Earl rejected the clause; and surely there could be no difference between rejecting it as part of a Bill and rejecting it as the whole. If you could reject the Bill you could reject the clause.earl Grey : He referred to the objection which had been made to his motion, as being an invasion of the privileges of the House of Commons, and he appealed, to the noble Lord near him (Viscount Eversley) whether he ever heard the notion vof the privilege of the House of Commons pushed to so utterly extravagant a pitch as.it133 B
had been by the noble duke (the duke of richmond) and the noble and learned lord opposite that evening. it must be remembered that he did not propose to amend the clause, to which he admitted there might have been an objection on the score of privilege, but simply to omit it. now it was perfectly certain that their lordships could have rejected this clause if it had been an independent bill; a fortiori they could reject it as part of another bill.Viscount Evbesley said in answer to the question put to him by the noble earl, that he was the last person to question the power of their lordships to make amend-ments to any bill sent up to them by the house of commons. but that house might reasonably object to amendments affecting rates or taxes as interfering with their privileges. in the present instance, however, it was not proposed to interfere with the amount of any rate or with its disposition or management, but simply to omit the clause under discussion; and, in his opinion, this omission could not be objected to by the commons on the ground of privilege, as it related to a subject separate from the main object of the bill, and it was quite as competent to their lordships to reject this clause as to reject a money bill which they could not amend without infringing the privileges of the other house of parliament.&quot;
