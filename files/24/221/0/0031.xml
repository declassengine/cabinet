Copy No.c.p.151(51)charing- cross bridge scheme.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport.i informed the Cabinet in my Memorandum C. T. 20 if ( 30) of the 12th June, l^jJO, of the proposal of the London County Council to appoint an Advisory Committee to review the whole position with regard to cross-river traffic at Charing Cross and to prepare an &quot;agreed&quot; scheme for a new road bridge and approaches.The decision to appoint this Committee was reached by the Council after the rejection by a Select Committee of the House of Commons of the Bill promoted by them in the last Session of Parliament embodying a scheme for a new bridge and approaches at Charing Cross, which had been adopted with the&apos;&apos;&apos; full approval of both the present and the late Governments.The Advisory Committee, which was presided over by The Right Hon. Sir Leslie Scott, 11.0., submitted its Report to the County Council on the Jrd March, 19^1.The Committee, though unanimous in their opinion that a now bridge at Charing Gross is essential, were not able to reach complete agreement as to the scheme to be recommended. Nine of the sixteen members constituting the Committee are agreed in recommending Scheme No.6 out of the nine schemes to which they gave detailed consideration, and state that in coming to this conclusion road traffic,  railway considerations, architectural aspects, and general amenities were taken into account.      This Scheme No.6 embodies all the essential principles of the scheme which was rejected by the Select Committee of the House of Commons though it differs from that scheme in certain respects.      The most Important difference
relates to the approach on the Lambeth side.      In the scheme submitted to Parliament in last year&apos;s Bill the Lambeth approachcame to ground level at the junction of waterloo Road, New Gut andOakley Street, whilst Scheme No.6, recommended by the majority ofthe Advisory Committee, provides for this approach road to reachground level at the junction of Vaterloo Road and York Road.      Theresult of this modification is to reduce the amount of bridging of roads very considerably with some loss from the point of viewmerely of the convenience of traffic.     Under the scheme in the Billpromoted by the London County Council, Waterloo Road was bridgedfor L20 feet and York Road for 360 feet.      In Scheme No.6 thebridging of Waterloo Road is reduced to 140 feet and a circus isproposed at the junction of York Road and Y/aterloo Road.      Theroads on the north and south sides of the island site in thiscircus would be bridged over for lengths of 260 feet and 160 feet,respectively, but owing to the open character of the space occupiedby the circus bridging over will be less objectionable.I have now received a letter dated the 29th April, 1931,from the London County Council in -which I am asked to assist themfurther in their consideration of the best means of dealing withthe Charing Cross Bridge problem by informing them -(l)    as to my general views upon the result of the Advisory Committee *s deliberations;    and(2)    eo to whether,  if the Council should decide to proceedwith a scheme based on the findings of the majority of the Advisory Committee, such a course would have my approval and support, accompanied by a definite undertaking that the Road Fund would bear 75 per cent, of the cost of the promotion and execution of the scheme .I have carefully considered the Report of the Advisory Committee, which is in considerable detail, and I find myself on merits in agreement with the recommendation made by the majority of its members in favour of Scheme No,6.
The net cost of Scheme Mo.6, after allowing for recoupment, is estimated at  12,970,000, somewhat more than the cost ( 12,500,000) of the scheme embodied in the Bill which was promoted by the Council, but I am advised that there are probable economies which should reduce the net cost by more than  500,000.No Information is available at present as to the extent to which Scheme No.6 will overcome the opposition to the London County&apos;Council (Charing Cross Bridge) Bill, of 1950.     Among the opponents to the Bill were the &quot;Westminster City Council and the- Lambeth Metropolitan Borough Council.The Southern Railway Company did not oppose the Bill as they had given their reluctant consent to the scheme embodied in it which, like Scheme No.6, involved the removal of the present Charing Cross station and the construction of a new station on the site of the Lion Brewery.Prom the minority report submitted by Brig.-Gen. Baring, and Sir Herbert Valker who represented the Southern Railway Company on the Advisory Committee, it is clear that the Company are not now prepared to agree to the removal of the station as they are of opinion that the evidence placed before the Advisory Committee has established that there are two schemes which would achieve the desired object, namely, the provision of a new road bridge over the River, without the removal of the station to the south side of the River.These two schemes are referred to in the Report of the Advisory Committee as schemes Nos. 1 and 2 respectively.Scheme No.l was supported by its authors, Mx*.V.V.Grierson, and Mr. E*F.C.Trench, who represented the Institution of Civil Sngineers on the Advisory Committee and are both Railway Engineers. The estimated net cost of this scheme, after allowing for recoupment, is  9,710,000 exclusive of the cost of any diversion
- if -of the Underground Railways or any expense incurred in connection with alterations to the existing Charing Cr ss station and its approaches.      Both Mr.Grierson and Mr. Trench indicated that they would join the majority in supporting Scheme No.6,  if their scheme proved to he impossible.      Scheme No.l was also supported by two other members who, if that scheme were impossible, expressed their preference for Scheme No.2.Scheme No.2 was supported by its author Sir Reginald Blomfield, who represented the Royal Academy.      The estimated net    cost of this scheme on the basis of the execution of the minimum works and after allowing for recoupment, but exclusive of any diversion of the Underground Railv/ays, is  8,500,000. Sir Reginald expressed his preference for Scheme No.l if the scheme suggested by him were impossible.The Advisory Committee&apos;s report contains detailed reasons for the rejection of these two schemes by the   majority of its members and, in my opinion, the reasons given are conclusive.The consent of the Southern Railway Company to the scheme embodied in the London County Council&apos;s Bill was only obtained on receipt of an assurance given by my predecessor in office on the * authority of the late Prime Minister, that the Government were aatisifed that the provision of an additional bridge over the Thames was a matter of national urgency, and, secondly, that the removal of Charing Cross Station to the south side of the River was vital to any such scheme for an additional bridge.On the merits of the  case, I consider that the Government should adhere to the opinion previously expressed that the provision of an additional bridge over the Thames at Charing Cross is a matter of urgency and that none of the schemes submitted which involve retention of Charing Cross Station on its present site present a satisfactory solution of the problem.
Ijth Lay, 1951.It is also clear that if the scheme based on the findings of the majority of the Advisory Committee is to proceed, it will he necessary to give an undertaking that a contribution of 75 ^er cent of the cost of the promotion and execution of the scheme would be made from the Road Fund. At the same time I do not think that the London County Council, should bo permitted to evade the onus of making up its mind and I therefore propose to reply to their letter to the effect that before arriving at any decision as to. renewing their offer of a 75v  grant towards a scheme such as that recommended by the Committee the Government would desirre to be informed whether upon examination by the Committee the Council approve it and would, in the event of a grant being available be prepared to proceed with it.      It might be added that the Government adheres to the view that no scheme would be satisfactory which did not provide for the removal of the existing railvay bridge.Meanwhile the Treasury will no doubt consider the grant aspect of the matter as we must obviously be in a position to give the London County Council an immediate reply should they make application/     In order to proceed with a Bill next session they would require a very early decision.(Intd.)
