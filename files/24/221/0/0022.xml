CABINET.AFGHANISTAN:   INTERNAL SITUATION.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a departmental note prepared at my request, on the position of the King of Afghanistan in the light of the present internal situation, the campaign in the Press and by the distribution of leaflets which has been started against him by the ex-King Araanullah, and the difficulties created by hostile propaganda based on the allegation that King Nadir is in our pay.W. B.India Office, 14th May 1931.SECRET.CP. 122 (31).(1) Re-establishment of Internal. Control, (a) Operations in Northern Afghanistan against Ibrahim Beg.The most serious internal problem which has faced the Afghan Government since the suppression in August 1930 of a revolt in the Koh-i-Daman area (30 miles north of Kabul) has been that of dealing with Ibrahim Beg and the Basmachis (refugees from Soviet territory, who use Afghanistan as a base for raids into the Soviet provinces north of the Oxus), of whom he is the most prominent leader. Ibrahim Beg appears also to have had the support of the remnants of the followers of Bacha-i-Saqao (with whom he had sided during the civil wars of 1929) and of the Koh-i-Damani rebels. The situation was made more difficult by the risk of serious complications with the Soviet Government consequent on the raids conducted by the Basmachis ; while the Central Government has throughout been greatly hampered in dealing with it by the unsettled state of the country generally, the absence of trained and disciplined troops, and the shortage of material and money.Up to July 1930 the Central Government, which had its hands full elsewhere, appears to have taken no very active steps against Ibrahiih Beg. The situation would seem to have been changed by a Soviet expedition in that month into Afghan territory to capture Ibrahim Beg. While the exxjedition was withdrawn in answer to Afghan protests, the Soviet are understood to have pressed strongly that effective action for his suppression should be taken by the Afghan Government; and every effort was subsequently made by the Central Government to some extent, it would appear, in collaboration with the Soviet authorities to bring about his capture. For many months, however, he carried on a more or less successful guerilla warfare against the Government forces sent against him, his successes being at times sufficiently marked to produce serious reactions on the position of the Central Government., The latest indications are, however, that operations against Ibrahim Beg under-flie conduct of the Minister of War, Shah Mahmud, a brother of King Nadir, have disposed of this menace, that his followers have been dispersed, and that he is himself a fugitive in Soviet territory.(b) Position in the Southern, Eastern and Herat Provinces.Ibrahim Beg&apos;s operations, while they lasted, wpre regarded very seriously by the-Central Government and imposed a heavy burden on them in troops and material. His elimination should ease the general situation considerably. This is important as King Nadirjs authority, while by now fairly well established in the Eastern Provinces of Afghanistan, appears still to be little more than nominal in the important province of Herat, where one Abdur Rahim, though in name an official of the Central Government, appears to enjoy a virtual independence. Nor is it yet on a sound .looting in the southern provinces (i.e. roughly speaking in the country between the 25       100   5.31[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.

Kandahar-Ghazni road and the Indian frontier, but not including Kandahar itself). In this latter area the control exercised by Nadir over the tribes of the Ivurrani border is still precarious: he cannot with certainty depend on the powerful but disunited Ghilzai tribes further south, and the possibility that these tribes may give fresh trouble, now that the winter migration season which they spent in India is over, cannot be overlooked.On the whole, however, while there is still much to be done, it may be said that the general indications are not unpromising.(2) JLmanullah&apos;s Campaign for Restoration.An intensive campaign against the present King, by propaganda in the Press and by the distribution of leaflets, has been started by the ex-king Amanullah, who alleges that Nadir is a usurper who, having returned to the Afghan political stage nominally as a supporter of Amanuilah, took advantage of the turn of events to secure the throne for himself.On legitimist grounds King Nadir, though a member of the Muhammadzai or Royal Family, has, of course, no title to the Afghan throne. His right to it is based on the will of the people expressed at a time of crisis when the throne was vacant, first by the abdication of Amanullah and then by that of his brother, Inayatullah. There is no reason to doubt that his elevation was in accordance with the real wish of the people, so far as such a thing can exist in a country of such tribal division as Afghanistan.   But the lack of legitimist title makes a good target.There is little sign of any appreciable revival of feeling in favour of Amanuilah among the tribes. Among the Pathans the ignominious circumstances of his flight would probably tell against him even more than his unpopular measures. The non-Pathans are probably indifferent to the issue between Nadir and Amanullah. The latte.r&apos;s potential supporters would be mainly among the intelligentsia and official classes of Kabul.The ex-King&apos;s recent pilgrimage to Mecca focussed attention on the possibility that he might be intending to make an immediate bid to bring about his restoration and suspicions that this might be the case were heightened hy the simultaneous departure on pilgrimage of various prominent Afghan exiles, some of whom at any rate were known to be definitely hostile to the present King. The information available goes, however, on the whole to show that while Amanullah is exploring the possibilities of, or may even be definitely preparing, an attempt to regain his throne, no immediate move on his part is to be anticipated. There is no definite evidence that the U.S.S.R. think it worth while to support him, though they would, no doubt, co-operate in his paper propaganda in order to make trouble for Nadir and for-the Government of India among the Indo-Afghan frontier tribes.The position seems in general to be that there is no serious and immediate danger to Nadir Shah, although the paper propaganda conducted against him by the ex-King is damaging to his credit; but that. Amanullah&apos;s pilgrimage to Mecca has probably gone some way to strengthen the position of the ex-King, and to make him more of a threat to Nadir, by rehabilitating him religiously, and possibly also by enabling him to make contacts which should prove of value in securing him money (he was said to be penniless on leaving Rome) and friends.(3) The Charge that Nadir is in British Pay.This charge can be worked in conjunction with Amanullah&apos;s propaganda, and the ex-King in fact appears to have made play with it in conversations at Mecca. In itself it is probably a more dangerous weapon against Nadir than Amanullah&apos;s propaganda. But much will depend on the success with which Nadir is able to rebut it.   This he at present proposes to do by publishing documents showing :  (a) That the ex-King was a pensioner of the U.S.S.K.(b) That he himself dissented from the Armistice terms accepted by Amanullahin 1919 at the close of the last Afghan war.(c) That he, Nadir, was not supported, as is often supposed, by. the BritishGovernment in 1929.On the whole Nadir can make out a good case for his being a more patriotic and -independent Afghan than Amanullah. Our financial assistance would have been ready for any Ruler who showed a capacity for consolidating Afghanistan under
himself (this being our own desideratum) and was not granted to Nadir because he was pro-British. Nevertheless, the fact that it has been given and still more his friendly attitude in regard to our frontier troubles lend a ready handle against him-.(4) Conclusions.To sum up, there are many difficulties in Nadir&apos;s position, and fresh causes of anxiety have recently been added. But there is at present little reason to suppose that he will not continue to be able to cope with them. He is assisted by the fact that his difficulties are, for the most part, separate and isolated factors. Ibrahim Beg is (or was) one problem and the Ghilzais another. The Ghilzai motive is dislike of control from Kabul; they have not at present much in common with the adherents of Amanullah (nor, indeed, have the other Pathan tribes). The chief danger (and this a remote one) to his position would probably be a movement among the Pathan tribes on the ground that his policy in regard to the Afridis and our frontier troubles, and his acceptance of assistance from us, definitely brand him as pro-British, a movement which, were it to occur, might be stimulated by propaganda conducted simultaneously by the Congress from India, by the ex-King and his adherents and by the U.S.S.R.
