With further reference to my telegram No. 77 of 22nd May and previous corres-pondence, we have now been advised by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand that it will not be possible, on account of political situation, for either Government to be represented by Ministers in August and probably not at any date later in 1931.      The Commonwealth Government states that it is most anxious to be represented, and would be grateful for postponement until early next year.      5 should like to have your view as to whether a definite statement should therefore be issued that under present circumstances it will not be possible to meet until next year.      I should also be glad of advice as to whether such postponement would be acceptable to India.     We are communicating with His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Union of South Africa and Irish Free State.
