ROYAL COMMISSION ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.FIRST REPORT.To the King&apos;s Most Excellent Majesty : May it Please Youe Majesty1. We, the undersigned Commissioners, were appointed under Your Majesty&apos;s Royal Warrant of the 9th December, 1930, to enquire into the provisions and working of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme and to make recommendations with regard to :-(i) its future scope, the provisions which it should contain and the means by which it may be made solvent and self-supporting, and(ii) the arrangements which should be made outside the scheme for the unemployed who are capable of and available for work ;and we humbly beg leave to report as follows : INTRODUCTORY.The proceedings of the Commission.2. We held our first meeting on 16th December, 1930, when we decided that the press and the public should be admitted to the meetings at which we heard oral evidence, and that the examina-tion of witnesses should be conducted by ourselves. We held our first public meeting to take evidence on 19th December, 1930, and we have held twenty-seven public meetings and examined seventy witnesses a list of whom is given in Appendix V.3. Representatives of the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Health, the Department of Health for Scotland, the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture&quot; for Scotland, and the Government Actuary have given evidence on the provisions, finance and working of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, the provision made by Local Authorities for the relief of the able-bodied unemployed and, on other matters relevant to our enquiry.4. The Unemployment Insurance Scheme is based upon contri-butions from employers and insured workpeople, as well as from the Exchequer, and we have therefore obtained evidence from re-presentatives of organisations of employers and workpeople. The Local Authorities who are now responsible for the administration of public assistance are also deeply interested in the nature of the provision to be made for the unemployed and we have obtained evidence from the Associations of Local Authorities and from representatives and officials of individual Authorities throughout the country. Evidence has also been given by persons with special knowledge and experience of the problems before us.   Verbatim
reports of the evidence given at each meeting have been published and placed on sale by Your Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office.5. To acquaint ourselves with the practical administration of un-employment insurance and the Poor Law, we have visited several industrial areas where we have obtained information from repre-sentative employers, trade union officials, Local Authorities, Chair-men of Courts of Referees, and Local Employment Committees. We have also visited many Employment Exchanges and training centres.The scope of the Report.6. It will be realised that our enquiry has raised many complex questions. Foremost among them is the question whether or not the principle of a contributory insurance scheme is applicable to the present industrial situation of Great Britain. That principle has been forcibly challenged in parts of the evidence before us. Apart from this question of principle, numerous questions of im-portance as to the provisions of a scheme immediately arise. There is, for example, the matter of the scope of an unemployment insurance scheme ; whether a scheme which includes all industries, whatever their varying risks.of unemployment, is really practicable ; whether industries or occupations at present outside the schema should be brought in, and whether some of those now in should be wholly or in part excluded. There is, again, the question of the best method of fixing rates of contribution ; and the further question whether there should be variable rates of benefit.7. The evidence already given has shown that the existing Un-employment Insurance Scheme suffers from a rigidity which makes t difficult readily to adjust its provisions to the varying needs of the unemployed workers and of industry. It is the desire of both workers and employers, as voiced by the Trades Union Congress General Council and by the National Confederation of Brn-ployers&apos; Organisations, that a much greater degree of elasticity should be introduced into the scheme. We shall have to consider, therefore, whether a method cannot be found by which, without departure from the expressed intention of Parliament, the scheme can be kept adaptable to the changing needs of the industrial situation.8. Under the second part of our terms of reference we are asked to consider the arrangement to be made outside the Scheme for able-bodied workers. However wide the limits of an unemployment insurance scheme may be, there will always be some persons who fail to satisfy the conditions for the receipt of benefit and for whom assistance must be provided in some other way. At present this provision is made by transitional benefit and by out-door relief. It is therefore our duty to review the whole question of the relief to be provided for able-bodied workers on account of unemployment. The evidence we have received shows the complexity of this aspect of the problem.   The Poor Law of Scotland differs in many respects10304 A i
from that of england and wales while in each country there is a diversity of practice in administration. during the last twenty years there has been a gradual and uncoordinated transfer from local to central government of the whole problem of the able-bodied unemployed, and of the distress due to unemployment. We regard as a most important part of our enquiry the determination of the proper sphere of the central government and of the Poor law authorities, and the best method of coordinating their activities so that the whole problem of the able-bodied unemployed may be properly covered without either gaps and hardships or duplication and waste.9. our examination of these problems is incomplete, and it will be some time before we are able to make final recommendations upon them. had it been possible we should have wished to present in a report our conclusions on the whole range of questions before us, but since we were appointed it has been pressed upon us by communications from tour majesty&apos;s government and by oon-tinuous references to the subject in your majesty&apos;s houses of Parlia-ment that there are matters raised by our enquiry of which, in the interests of the state, immediate consideration is required. In the first stage of our enquiry, therefore, we have given special attention to these matters and, in compliance with the request made to us, we present this interim report in advance of our final conclusions. we confine our recommendations to the matters which have been represented to us as urgent. they are as follows : (1) the increasing indebtedness of the unemployment pund out of which unemployment benefit under the insurance scheme is paid;(2) the increasing cost to the exchequer of transitional benefit; and(3) the suggestion that unemployment benefit is being paid to certain classes of persons in circumstances which the unem-ployment insurance scheme was never intended to cover.10. in order to make clear the essential facts of the present situation, we think it necessary to refer quite briefly to :   (1) the extent of unemployment; (2) the development of unemployment insurance; (3) the provisions now in force; and(4) the finances of the unemployment fund and the cost of unemployment benefit to the exchequer.i. the extent of unemployment.11. it is not necessary for us to enter upon an elaborate examina-tion of the causes of unemployment, the nature of post-war unem-ployment or the possible reactions of the unemployment insurance scheme on employment. these are matters on which we shall have to report in some detail in making our final proposals. ii is sufficient, therefore, if we indicate the extent to which the
present position of the unemployment fund is due (a) to an under-estimate of the average level of post-war unemployment, and (6) to the effects of the world-wide depression which began about 13 months ago.1%e average level of unemployment.12. the average percentage of the insured population recorded as unemployed at the end of each month since december, 1920, when the unemployment insurance scheme was extended to its present limits, is 12.2; representing nearly one and a half million persons. the contributions and benefits provided by the unem-ployment insurance act, 1922, and continuing to the second act of 1924, balanced at about this percentage, and the scheme may be taken to have been at this stage solvent and self-supporting. no other act since 1920 has satisfied this condition. the acts now in operation fall far short of it.13. to take the average percentage over the last ten years as a measure of the risk is, however, unsafe, since the average may conceal a marked trend. such a trend is suggested if the years 1921-24 be compared with the years 1925-28. in the earlier period of four years the average unemployment was 13.1 per cent., in the latter 10.9 per cent., these figures pointing to a progressive im-provement. this improvement is probably explained in large measure by the reduction in the number of unemployed in the engineering and metal industries which were unduly expanded by the war demand for munitions. between june 1923 and june 1928 the number of the recorded unemployed in engineering, shipbuilding, iron and steel fell by 147,500, from 308,000 to 160,500; in the same period the numbers insured in these indus-tries fell by 119,000 from 1,243,000 to 1,124,000. thus the im-provement was effected by a contraction in the numbers engaged (in other words by transfer and absorption elsewhere), rather than by an increase in employment in those industries.14. this improvement has, however, been checked. the average for the years 1927-30 was 11.6 per cent., the per-centages for these four years separately being 9.6, 10.7, 10.3 and 15.9. the same conclusion is suggested by a comparison of the effects on employment of the present world depression in trade with the effects of the similar depression of 1921-22; 1930 had a higher percentage (15.9) than 1922 (14.1) and almost as high a percentage as the year of the coal stoppage, 1921 (16.6). it would, therefore, be unsafe to assume any trend in the direction of improved average employment.Distribution of unemployment.15. in addition to a high average level, unemployment since the war has had another characteristic which must be taken into account, viz., a high minimum of unemployment. the percentage has never fallen below 8.6, and in only three months in the last
aten years has it fallen below 9. The minimum number of unera-ployed above which fluctuations in employment have taken place, is therefore about 1,100,000. This high minimum is due in part to the persistence of high unemployment in certain industries. It points to certain obstinate factors that do not respond to ordinary trade improvement.16. In the following table are listed a number of industries which, for three years now, have had at the end of each quarter (with very occasional exceptions), more than 10 per cent, of unemployment and also more unemployment than the average of all industry. The table gives for each industry the average of the percentage of unemployment at the end of each quarter in the years 1928-29, and the number of insured workers recorded as attached to the industry in July 1930 : Great Britain.

17. This group of industries, comprising about a third of the insured population, accounted in the years taken, for half the recorded unemployment. The years 1928-29 were years of good employment judged by post-war standards; the Board of Trade Index of Production was 105.5 and 111.8 for the two years respec-tively, as compared with 103.3 in 1930 and 100 in 1924. Yet the average unemployment in these industries was 16.3 per cent. ; while in the remaining two-thirds of insured industry, in years of good employment and after excluding all the &quot; depressed &quot; in-dustries; 7.1 per cent, of the insured population was unemployed.18. The causes of the depression in the industries of exceptional unemployment are easy to understand. These industries fall into three broad classes which, to some extent, overlap. There is first, the class of industry which is still suffering from a war-time expan-sion in excess of normal peace-time requirements. It must be remembered that the expansion in the industries supply-ing munitions was not confined to this country, and that the in-dustries affected by it in this country were affected by it in the world as a whole. In this class fall iron and steel, shipbuilding and certain branches of engineering, and to some extent, coal-mining. There is second, the class of industry that before the war was dependent to a great extent on exports, and that has suffered since the war a loss of a part of its overseas markets, coupled in some cases with an invasion by imports of its home market. This is the largest class, overlapping the previous class, and accounting most obviously for the exceptional unemployment in the textile and coal-mining industries. There is third, a class of industries, which has been expanding rather than contracting and enjoying in some cases, a high degree of prosperity in which, in the words of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Memorandum of Evidence,* &quot; the extent of recorded unemployment is almost as much a matter of internal organisation as of external pressure of bad trade, and &quot;  the Memorandum goes on &quot; the relation between the present &apos; organisation &apos; and the insurance scheme is, on this account, of double importance.&quot; To this class belong building and public works contracting, in which a large expenditure of public money has stimulated employment without preventing unemployment; docks ; and the expanding service of road transport.19. The significance of the high level of unemployment in the rest of industry is not so readily apparent. Some significance must attach to a proportion of one in fourteen out of work in a period of active trade and, in other countries, of abounding prosperity, in a class of industries from which have been excluded, not only the industries adversely affected by the war or by the decline in exports, but also those in which there is a special problem of unemploy-ment rising from internal organisation.   Since it persists after the* Paper No 8 &apos;&apos;Employment and Unemployment since 1920&quot;, Pago 115. Fourth Day&apos;s Minutes of Evidence.
influence of the transient effects of the war has been excluded, it must be associated with some more permanent condition of British industry, possibly in part with the existence of the Unem-ployment Insurance Scheme itself. The discernment of this con-dition is a matter of the highest practical importance but a discussion of it would take us beyond the limits of the considerations which are necessary for the purposes of an interim Eeport.20. It is clear from this brief survey that the most serious ele-ment in the situation is the average level of unemployment of 12.2 per cent. This represents a persistent and obdurate problem, and, in our view, it would be unwise to itreat this experience of the last ten years as transitory or to assume that it over-values the risk that has to be provided for in the next few years. More-over, for the purpose of immediate measures, it must be noted that the percentage of unemployment to-day is, in fact, far higher than 12.2 per cent.; since December, 1930, it has been 20 per cent, or over. This excess over the average is due to the second element to which we refer in paragraph 11 above, i.e., the effects of the world wide depression of the last 18 months. The indications are that unemployment will not fall appreciably in the next few months below the present level. What is necessary now is to adjust the finances of the Fund to present circumstances, and for the purposes of this Eeport we do not feel justified in anticipating an average Live Eegister* of less than 2,500,000.II. THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.The position before 1911.21. We do not propose to describe the history of unemployment insurance in detail. At the same time it is important to call attention to the principles on which the first Unemployment Insur-ance Scheme was based in 1911; to make plain the process by which increased provision has been made out of central funds for unemployed workers and to show how, in the course of frequent amending legislation, there has been a progressive relaxation, amounting practically to the abandonment, of the principles upon which the original Insurance Scheme was framed.22. Before 1911, except for recourse to charity and to the Poor Law, an unemployed worker was dependent upon the provision which he himself made for unemployment, either by private savings or by trade union unemployment benefit. The provision of unem-ployment benefit, along with benefits for sickness, death, accidents, etc., was a feature of many trade unions for upwards of seventy* The Live Register includes (1) insured persons in receipt of benefit, (2) insured persons in the waiting period or with claims to benefit under consideration, (3) insured persons whose benefit claims have been disallowed, (4) insured persons who have registered but have not made claims to benefit, and (5) uninsured persons.
nyears. This, however, was confined to workers in skilled occupa-tions and, in general, no such provision existed for unskilled workers. Even in such industries as cotton and coal mining, trade union benefits were little developed; these industries met depres-sion of trade by short-time working and trade unions did not supple-ment short-time earnings. The workers belonging to trade unions that provided unemployment benefit usually contributed 3d. or a smaller sum per week to the funds of the union for this kind of benefit, and seldom received as benefit when unemployed more than 10s. per week, and that only for a limited period, usually not exceeding 26 weeks in a year. If a member had exhausted his claim he could not, as a rule, claim again until he had been in work for a specified period.23. Trade union benefit was obviously designed to tide the worker over a short period of unemployment and to avoid the necessity for members, in the event of unemployment, having to accept employment at less than the trade union rate of wages or having to apply for any form of relief to the Poor Law Authorities. Outdoor relief for able-bodied workers was not given freely by Boards of Guardians in England and Wales and, where it was given, it was the subject to the performance of a task of work. In Scotland there was no provision before the Act of 1921 for granting out-door relief to able-bodied workers.The 1911 Scheme.24. The introduction of statutory Unemployment Insurance followed the extensive enquiries into unemployment of the Royal Commission of 1905-1909. So far were the Commission from being satisfied as to the practicability of a general scheme which would not have unfavourable reactions on employment, that neither the Majority nor the Minority recommended such a scheme, both preferring the method of encouraging voluntary insurance by a subsidy to voluntary schemes. But the establishment of a State system of Employment Exchanges in 1909 made it possible in 1911 to introduce, as an experiment and for a few selected trades cover-ing about 2J million workers, compulsory State Insurance against unemployment. The weekly benefit for adults was 7s. There was no additional benefit for dependants. The joint weekly contribu-tions from employers and employed was 5d., in equal proportions, to which the State added one-third. The amount of benefit payable to a claimant was limited to one week&apos;s benefit for five week&apos;s contributions, which could only be drawn for fifteen weeks in any twelve months.25. Those responsible for the Scheme believed that it was neces-sary to put limits upon exceptionally bad risks and therefore held that &quot; there must be a maximum limit to the amount of benefit which can be drawn, both absolutely and in relation to the amount
of contribution paid; or, in other words, we must in some way or other secure that the number of weeks for which a workman contributes should bear some relation to his claim upon the fund.&quot;* 26. Sir William Beveridge, who took an active pant in the pre-paration of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme of 1911, in his evidence before us, explained that the scheme was conceived only as a first line of defence against distress due to unemployment. He stated :  &quot; Compulsory Unemployment Insurance was introduced in 1911, primarily as a means of extending something like the trade union system to unskilled and unorganised workmen. It was meant to provide a benefit strictly limited in duration, to men whose eligibility for benefits could be determined by some simple automatic test, and under rules designed to interest workpeople and employers alike in reducing unem-ployment and avoiding&quot; unnecessary claims.   This last motive was, indeed, one of the main reasons for requiring contribu-tions from employers; the contributions would vary from time to time with the rate of unemployment.    The contribution from the State was justified partly as an expression of the interest of the State in reducing distress through unemploy-ment, partly as a means of equalising risks and contributions. The scheme was introduced at first experimentally for a few trades, those where systematic short time was customary (such as cotton and coal) being deliberately excluded; unemployed benefit was regarded as an alternative to organised short time, not as a subsidy in aid of it.   The trades insured at the outset included also, by design, hardly any women, so that the prob-lem of insurance of women after marriage did not arise.&quot; 27. Great emphasis was placed upon interesting employers and workers alike in saving the Unemployment Fund from avoidable claims.   It was realised that the mere provision of payments to un-employed workers might itself encourage unemployment in several ways, e.g., by relaxing the efforts of employers to maintain steady employment, by affecting the readiness of workers to move into new trades and new districts and by tending to rigidity of wage rates. Various devices were incorporated in the 1911 Scheme which were designed to reward and encourage the prevention of unemployment.28. It is clear that there has been a radical change since 1911. The relation between contributions and benefits has been severed by the change in the qualifying contribution condition; the maxi-mum limit to benefit has been abolished by the continued provision of &apos;&apos; extended &quot;or &quot; transitional &apos;&apos; benefit; the rate of benefit for a man with a family has been raised to the level of full-ftime earnings* Presidential Address by the Permanent Secretary of the Board of Trade (Sir H. Llewellyn Smith, 6.C.B.), to the Economic Section of the British Association, 1910.
in some occupations; the Scheme is no longer based on the trade group; casual engagements have been encouraged rather than discouraged; the necessity for voluntary provision has been in great part removed.The 1920 Scheme.29. It was not possible to give the 1911 Scheme a fair trial. The period immediately preceding the war was one of good em-ployment, while during the war there was very little call upon the Fund. After the war, an attempt was made to meet the economic crisis with which the country was likely to be faced by extending the contributory scheme of Unemployment Insurance to all manual workers (with certain exceptions) and to non-manual workers earning not more than  250 a year. No material changes in the classes of workers insured have been made since 1920 and there are to-day about 12,000,000 workers insured. The main classes excluded are agriculture (1,000,000); private domestic service (1,400,000); railwaymen and permanent employees of Local Authorities covered by certificates of exception issued by the Ministry of Labour (525,000); Civil Servants; and persons under 16 and over 64 years of age. About 28,000 workers hold certificates of exemption and about 137,000 workers are covered by the two Special Schemes for the banking and insurance industries.30. In the Act of 1920 the intention was to maintain some of the original principles of the 1911 Scheme. Benefit was to be payable to a claimant in the ratio of one week&apos;s benefit for six weeks&apos; con-tributions, for a maximum period of fifteen weeks in a year.Extensions of the Scheme.31. These restrictions had a short life, for in 1921 an amendment was made to the effect that benefit was to be paid in advance of contributions to unemployed persons who, it was anticipated, would ordinarily find work in insurable trades. This was the first of a succession of attempts to adapt the Scheme to carry a load which it was not designed to bear, and successive Governments, confronted by an unprecedented mass of unemployment, have failed to recog-nise the limitations of the Insurance Scheme and, finding it avail-able, have used it as a means of dealing with a situation for which it was not suited.32. The provision of &quot; uncovenanted benefit &quot; or &quot; extended benefit &quot; to provide for unemployment, which continued beyond the limits of the Insurance Scheme, was continued until April, 1928, when the Act of 1927 came into operation. Except, however, for a period in 1924, this form of benefit was not a statutory right but -was a privilege to be granted at the discretion of the Minister if he deemed it expedient in the public interest. The way in which the Minister exercised his discretion was to exclude certain classes of persons in whose case the grant of benefit beyond their insurance rights was deemed not to be necessary in view of other resources.
Dependants&apos; Benefit.33. Another important change made in 1921 was the introduction of supplementary benefit for dependants. This was originally intended as a temporary measure for six months, and was made ancillary to the main scheme but financially independent of it. Additional contributions were provided at the rate of 2d. each from employers and workers and 3d. from the Exchequer. The rates of dependants benefit were 5s. a week for an adult dependant and Is. a week for each child. In 1922 the dependants&apos; benefit scheme was merged into the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, and it has continued as part of the scheme ever since.The Scheme of the Blanesburgh Committee.34. A Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Blanesburgh was appointed in November, 1925, to consider what changes should be made in the Scheme. When the Committee was appointed, the payment of &apos;&apos; standard benefit &apos;&apos; within the strict Insurance Scheme was limited by the following rules : (I) the claimant had to show that he had paid at least 20 contributions in a recent period varying from one to two years;(2) benefit was payable in the ratio of one week&apos;s benefit . for six contributions;(3) there was a limit of 26 weeks&apos; benefit in a year. Persons who were unable to satisfy these rules were, however, still able to qualify for &quot; extended benefit &quot; under certain con-ditions.35. The Committee recommended as a permanent scheme that unemployment benefit should be paid to an unemployed worker who complied with the conditions inter alia: (1) that he had paid thirty contributions in the preceding two years.(2) that he was genuinely seeking work but unable to obtain suitable employment. The Committee placed great emphasis on the need for ensuring that benefit was paid only in genuine cases. They said that &quot; in so far as there are persons satisfying this test &quot; (i.e., the thirty con-tributions qualification), &quot; who are seeking benefit in preference to employment we rely upon their being excluded under the second condition, viz., that they are not &apos; genuinely seeking work.&apos;36. In framing their scheme the Committee, after allowing for the abnormal unemployment due to the stoppage in the coal mining industry in 1926, anticipated that their proposals would disqualify for benefit only a small minority of workers who were continuously unemployed for any length of time and were unable to obtain work in an average of 15 weeks out of 52. On this premise the Committee proposed certain transitional arrangements
to last for one year &quot;as an incidental matter consequent on the change from a temporary to a permanent scheme.&quot; The Act of 1927 which gave effect to their proposals accordingly provided that up to a date, varying according to individual circumstances between 19th April, 1929, and 18th April, 1930, a person of 18 years of age and over, who was unable to satisfy con-dition (1) above mentioned, might still qualify for &quot; transitional benefit &quot; if, in lieu thereof, he could satisfy the following three conditions : (a) that eight or more contributions have been paid during the period of two years immediately preceding the date of the application for benefit; or that thirty or more contribu-tions have been paid at any time, and(b) that he is normally employed in insurable employment and that he will normally seek to obtain his livelihood by means of insurable employment; and(c) that he has during the past two years been employed in an insurable employment to such an extent as was reason-able having regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to the opportunities for obtaining insurable em-ployment during that period.37. The level of unemployment did not fall as anticipated by the Blanesburjgh Committee and the number of persons who were admitted to transitional benefit far exceeded the number which was contemplated. On 28th January, 1929, the number in receipt of transitional benefit was about 120,000. In these circumstances an Act was passed on 27th March, 1929, extending the &quot; transitional period &quot; for another twelve months to 18th April, 1930. The 1930 Act postponed the termination of the period for another year and in 1931 it has again been extended so that it does not begin to expire until 18th October, 1931. The 1930 Act also repealed transitional condition (c).38. Following upon the report of a Committee under the Chair-manship of Sir Harold Morris, K.C., the Act of 1930 also repealed the condition requiring a claimant to prove that he was &apos;&apos; genuinely seeking work but unable to obtain suitable employment.&quot; No new condition was set up in its place but the Act introduced a new disqualification to the effect that in the event of its being proved that a claimant without good cause had refused or failed to apply for or to accept a vacant situation notified to him, or to carry out reasonable written directions given to him with a view to assisting him to find suitable employment, he should be dis-qualified for a period not exceeding six weeks. The importance of this step, both in its financial and social effects, lies in its abroga-tion of what the Blanesburgh Committee relied upon as the main defence against the exploitation of the easy qualifying contribution condition which they proposed.
iii. the provisions now in force.39. It will be advisable at this point, even at the risk of partial repetition, to make clear the provisions at present in operation &quot;ntib regard to -(1) the Insurance Scheme, (2) transitional benefit, and (3) public assistance (out-door relief).the insurance Scheme.40. The income of the Unemployment Fund is derived from contributions payable by employers, workers and the Exchequer at the following weekly rates : Class of Employed Persons.	Employees Contri-bution.	Employed Persoirs Contri-bution.	Exchequer Contri-bution.	Total Contri-bution.	d.	d.	d.	d.Men aged 21 and under 65 ...	8	7	74	221Young men aged 18 and under	7	6	64	19421.				Boys under 18 ...	4	34	3a	lliWomen aged 21 and under 65	7	6	CO	194Young   women  aged 18 and	6	5	54	164under 21.				Girls under 18...	34	3	3i	9141. Contributions are payable only in respect of insured persons who are employed. The change in the income of the Fund due to changes in the total numbers of the insured contributors is negligible in comparison with the variation in the cost of unem-ployment benefit due to fluctuations in the Live Register. On the basis of a Live Register of 2,500,000 unemployed persons the income in 1931-2 derived from contributions at the rates set out in the above table will be about  44,550,000. In other words a Id. a week contribution for a man, with appropriate contributions for other classes, produces about  2,000,000 per annum from each of the three parties (employers, employed persons and the Exchequer) or a total of  6,000,000.42. A contribution is paid for each week in which any work is done, so that a contribution does not necessarily represent a full week&apos;s work; it may have been paid in respect of work on one day only in any week.43. A person is entitled to Insurance benefit if he is able to satisfy the following conditions : (a) that he has paid at least thirty contributions in the last two years;
(b) that he applies for benefit in the prescribed manner and proves that he is continuously unemployed;(c) that he is capable of and available for work;(d) that if so required he has attended an approved course of instruction.44. As stated in para. 38 above, a claimant is disqualified for benefit (for not more than six weeks), if he refuses or fails to apply for suitable employment which is notified to him. The Acts also prescribe that the claimant shall be disqualified for benefit if he has lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute, or through misconduct or if he has left his employ-nient voluntarily without just cause. There are also certain other disqualifications of less importance.45. A worker who has paid thirty contributions in thirty succes-sive weeks and is then continuously unemployed and unable to pay further contributions, is qualified for Insurance benefit for 74 weeks. A worker who continues to satisfy the 30 contributions condition is qualified for Insurance benefit without limit.46. The present rates of benefit for adult men and women are 17s. and 15s. per week respectively. In addition there is an allowance for not more than one adult dependant of 9s. per week and for each dependent child of 2s. per week. The rates of benefit for other classes are as follows : Young men (18, 19 and 20) ... Boys (17 and under 18) Boys (16 and under 17) Young women (18, 19 and 20) Girls (17 and under 18)    ... Girls (16 and under 17)s.	d.14	0*9	06	012	0*7	65	0Transitional Benefit.47. We have described in paragraphs 36 and 37 the circum-stances in which it was decided to pay benefit to persons who fail to satisfy the Insurance test of thirty contributions in the preceding two years. The position to-day is that a claimant who has reached the age of 18 years and is unable to show that he has paid thirty contributions within the preceding two years can qualify for tran-transitional benefit if he is able to prove (a) that eight or more contributions have been paid in respect of him during the period of two years immediately pre-ceding the date of his application for benefit or that thirty con-tributions had been paid at any time;* -In these cases the rate of benefit is increased to the rate of benefit for the adult (in addition to the allowance for dependants), if the young person has&quot;dependants.
and (b) that he is normally employed in insurable employ-ment and will normally seek to obtain his livelihood by means of insurable employment. He must also show that he satisfies the other conditions for benefit and is free from disqualification.48. The numbers of persons estimated to be in receipt of transitional benefit are : January, 1929       ...............   120,000October, 1929        ...............   130,000February, 1930      ...............   140,000The Act of 1930 came into operation on 13th March, 1930, and was followed by an immediate increase in the numbers of persons in receipt of transitional benefit. In May, 1930, the number was estimated to have risen to over 300,000. Of this increase of 160,000 in a period of three months, some small part was no doubt due to the general increase of 246,000 in the &quot; Live Register &quot; between the two dates and to the termination of claims to ordinary benefit. Again, it was stated before us that 50,000 were persons transferred from the Poor Law. For the most part the others were persons who were not previously in receipt of benefit or Poor Law relief either because they were disqualified or because they had not applied for it. Out of the increase of 160,000 it is estimated that 60,000 were persons who had not previously registered themselves for employment at an Employment Exchange.49. Since May, 1930, the number of persons in receipt of tran-transitional benefit has further increased, and in May, 1931, it was 410,000. It must be anticipated that the numbers will continue to increase in view of the persistence of exceptionally heavy unemploy-ment which will cause an increase in the number of workers with less than 30 contributions to their credit in the preceding two years.50. The workers in receipt of transitional benefit are of all types. Some are persons who have been in receipt of Insurance benefit until recently but are no longer able to show that they have paid 30 contributions in the last two years. Others are workers who have had little or no insurable employment in recent yea,rs, and many of these are in areas which have suffered most severely from the continued depression in the export industries. They include older people who had been in steady employment for many years but who in recent years have paid few contributions and those irregularly, and a- number of persons who came into employment only in recent years who therefore have paid only a small number of contributions but may be expected to pay contributions again in the future. And, lastly, there are those who are no more than just within the employment field and do little work at any time, and those with physical disabilities which make it extremely
improbable that they will be able to obtain further industrial employment.51. At our request a detailed analysis of the persons applying for transitional benefit was made in &quot;February, 1931. The results are given in Appendix III together with some comparable statistics obtained from an analysis made in May, 1930. The features which this analysis reveals are (1) the disproportionate number of transitional benefit claimants in certain depressed industries, notably coal mining in the case of men, and cotton in the case of women ;(2) the comparatively small proportion of workers in receipt of transitional benefit in the southern divisions of the country, and the concentration of women transitional benefit claimants in the textile districts of Lancashire (North Western Division);(3) in February, 1931, about 37 per cent, of the men were 50 years of age or over; 68.5 per cent, of the women were married and of these, 46.3 per cent, were under 30 years of age.(4) on 31st January, 1931, nearly half of the men and more than half of the women had paid no contributions, and nearly three-quarters of both men and women had paid less than 8 contributions in the preceding twelve months.Public Assistance (Out-doob Relief).52. The Poor Law is administered by Local Authorities on principles entirely different from those of an unemployment in-surance scheme. The Poor Law deals with anyone who is destitute whether within or without the defined sphere of Unemployment Insurance. About six million workers employed under a contract of service and, in addition, a large number of persons engaged in business on their own account are not covered by the Unemploy-ment Insurance Scheme. Those who, when unemployed, are not qualified for unemployment benefit (either Insurance or transi-tional) may be relieved according to need by the Poor Law Authorities.53. It is a general Poor Law principle that in determining what relief should be afforded, income and means from every source available to the household* must be taken into account. The amount of the relief therefore varies not only from individual to individual, but also possibly from week to week in the case of the same individual. Nevertheless, many Poor Law Authorities have adopted scales of relief for the guidance of their Committees, as indicating generally the appropriate total to which income fromThis is subject in England and Wales to two statutory exceptions whereby the first 5s. of Friendly Societies sick pay and the first 7s. 6d. of National Health Insurance benefit are not taken into account in estimating the relief to be granted.   In Scotland, only the second of these exceptions applies.
relief, plus income from other sources may be brought. We are informed that those authorities who have adopted such scales have been to a greater or less degree influenced by the scale of unemplov ment benefit. In most areas the scale is below that of unom-ployment benefit. In some areas it is higher, particularly in the case of persons with a large number of dependants, and the Poor Law Authorities may then supplement the unemployment benefit paid by the Exchange. Instances have been given to us mainly from mining areas, where the amount of outdoor relief granted to unemployed persons on the basis of need is higher than the earnings of the applicant when in employment.54. Since 1921 there has been a great increase in the number of able-bodied persons applying for outdoor relief. Witnesses of experience and authority have stated before us that while an un-employed worker prefers to obtain benefit from the Employment Exchange, the stigma which was formerly attached to outdoor relief has largely disappeared. At our request the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Department of Health undertook a special analysis of the persons, ordinarily engaged in some regular occupa-tion, to whom out-door relief was given during the week ended 7th February, 1931. The results of that analysis show that the numbers relieved &quot; on account of unemployment &quot; in Great Britain at that date were 57,041 men and 4,592 women. The numbers relieved for &quot; causes other than unemployment &quot; were 42,777 men and 6,575 women. Of those relieved on account of unemployment, 39,052 men (68.4 per cent, of the men) and 1,554 women (33.8 per cent, of the women) were persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. They included persons with disallowed claims for benefit, persons serving a waiting period and a number of persons receiving concurrently out-relief (in money or kind) and unemployment benefit. The numbers in receipt of pay-ment from both sources were 13,544 men (34.7 per cent, of the insured men), and 611 women (39.3 per cent, of the insured women), or a total of 14,155 (34.9 per cent.).55. Some of these persons were receiving supplementary relief on account of the sickness of a member of the family. It is not known what proportion of transitional benefit claimants are included in these figures. But it is apparent that the number of cases in which unemployment benefit is so far insufficient to meet the needs of the worker and his family as to compel the worker to have resort to public assistance is but a small fraction (less than 1 per cent.) of the total number of workers in receipt of unemployment benefit.The Cost of Out-door Relief.56. The expenditure of Poor Law Authorities on the out-door relief of able-bodied unemployed is in no way comparable with the -cost of unemployment benefit, and unlike the latter it has fallen con-.siderably since 1927-28. In England and Wales the cost of out-door
relief, plus income from other sources may be brought. We are informed that those authorities who have adopted such scales have been to a greater or less degree influenced by the scale of unemploy ment benefit. In most areas the scale is below that of unemployment-ployment benefit. In some areas it is higher, particularly in the case of persons with a large number of dependants, and the Poor Law Authorities may then supplement the unemployment benefit paid by the Exchange. Instances have been given to us mainly from mining areas, where the amount of outdoor relief granted to unemployed persons on the basis of need is higher than the earnings of the applicant when in employment.54. Since 1921 there has been a great increase in the number of able-bodied persons applying for outdoor relief. Witnesses of experience and authority have stated before us that while an un-employed worker prefers to obtain benefit from the Employment Exchange, the stigma which was formerly attached to outdoor relief has largely disappeared. At our request the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Department of Health undertook a special analysis of the persons, ordinarily engaged in some regular occupa-tion, to whom out-door relief was given during the week ended 7th February, 1931. The results of that analysis show that the numbers relieved &quot;on account of unemployment&quot; in Great Britain at that date were 57,041 men and 4,592 women. The numbers relieved for &apos;&apos; causes other than unemployment &apos;&apos; were 42,777 men and 6,575 women. Of those relieved on account of tinemployment, 39,052 men (68.4 per cent, of the men) and 1,554 women (33.8 per cent, of the women) were persons insured under -the Unemployment Insurance Acts. They included persons with disallowed claims for benefit, persons serving a waiting period and a number of persons receiving concurrently out-relief (in money or kind) and unemployment benefit. The numbers in receipt of pay-ment from both sources were 13,544 men (34.7 per cent, of the insured men), and 611 women (39.3 per cent, of the insured women), or a total of 14,155 (34.9 per cent.).55. Some of these persons were receiving supplementary relief on account of the sickness of a member of the family. It is not known what proportion of transitional benefit claimants are included in these figures. But it is apparent that the number of cases in which unemployment benefit is so far insufficient to meet the needs of the worker and his family as to compel the worker to have resort to public assistance is but a small fraction (less than 1 per cent.) of the total number of workers in receipt of unemployment benefit.The Cost of Out-door Relief.56. The expenditure of Poor Law Authorities on the out-door relief of able-bodied unemployed is in no way comparable with the .oost of unemployment benefit, and unlike the latter it has fallen con-.siderably since 1927-28. In England and Wales the cost of out-door
relief in money and kind to the able-bodied unemployed * and their dependants in the past four years has been as follows :  Year ended 31st March, 1928       .,,      ...      5,666,481 ear ended 31st March, 1929       ......       4,088,472Year ended 31st March, 1930       ......      3,224,294Year ended 31st March, 1931       ......      1,550,033Corresponding figurest for Scotland are as follows : Total.  Year ended 15th May, 1928  .........      1,560,006Year ended 15th May, 1929 .........      1,184,376Year ended 15th May, 1930 .........      1,002,920Year ended 15th May, 1931 .........        589,00057. The amendments in the conditions for the receipt of benefit made by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1930, effected a very considerable reduction by transferring from poor relief to un-employment benefit, mainly transitional benefit, large numbers, of persons who had previously been disallowed or were not eligible for benefit. Thex-e was a decrease between March and July, 1930, of the numbers of unemployed insured persons in receipt of out-door relief from 54,228 to 23,875 in England and Wales,, and from 18,089 to 8,164 in Scotland. The decrease in this period for all unemployed persons and then dependants in receipt of out-door relief was from 233,920 to 109,226 in England and Wales,, and from 66,172 to 32,058 in Scotland. Since then, however, the: numbers of the able-bodied unemployed in receipt of out-door-relief have gradually increased. This is no doubt due in part to the large increase of unemployment during the past winter, and. in part to the subsequent disallowance of certain persons who were; admitted to unemployment benefit in March and April, 1930.58. Before the 1st April, 1930 (England and Wales), and 16th-May, 1930 (Scotland), when the Councils took over Poor Law functions from the Boards of Guardians and the Parish Councils,, the cost of poor relief was unevenly spread. In 1929, 75.5 per cent, of the total number of able-bodied persons receiving out-door relief in England and Wales were accounted for-by 34 Unions out of 631. The burden of this unemployment had; the most serious effects on those areas. The position has now been considerably eased by the Local Government Acts, 1929,. whereby the number of authorities was reduced in England and Wales from 631 to 145, and in Scotland from 870 to 55.   Although* This description comprises (i) unemployed insured persons, and (ii) unemployed uninsured persons, registered at Employment Exchanges.t The figures for Scotland relate to the cost of out-door relief to persons, ordinarily engaged in some regular occupation (and their dependants) whose, relief was due to their unemployment.

in February, 1931, approximately 75 per cent, of the able-bodied persons in receipt of out-door relief were accounted for by 23 out of 145 authorities in England and Wales, and by 8 out of 55 in Scotland, the 1929 Acts have removed, by spreading the burden, the many glaring inequalities which existed in the poor rates 1 levied within the several areas comprised in a county, and the substitution of the county as the unit of administration and charge for public assistance, has assisted to solve the difficulties of a number of small industrial areas with limited financial resources which were severely hit by heavy and long continued unemployment. There has also been an increased measure of Exchequer assistance to necessitous areas, by the intro-duction of the system of &quot; Block grants &quot; distributed according to a formula of which one factor is the amount of unemployment in the area.IV.-FINANCE.FINANCES OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT FUND, 1920-1931.59. We proceed now to outline the finances of Unemployment Insurance. Benefit is paid out of the Unemployment Fund, and . j before the Act of 1930, the cost of all benefit was charged against the ordinary revenue of the Fund. When the Act of 1920 came into operation the Fund had a credit balance of over  22,000,000. In July, 1921, this reserve was exhausted and recourse was had to borrowing. This borrowing was continued because it was considered that the heavy unemployment, though not likely to fall appreciably in the immediate future, could not be of long duration, and in March I 1923 the Fund was in debt to the amount of about  16,750,000. The debt then fell gradually and in August, 1924, it had been largely repaid and only  4,500,000 was owing. At that time (1924) j the income of the fund could finance a Live Register of a little over 1,400,000. By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act of 1924, however, the rates of benefit were increased, the waiting period was reduced to three days and &quot; extended benefit &quot; was granted as a right. As no extra income was provided to meet the cost of these changes, the balancing point of the Fund was reduced from a Live Register of 1,400,000 to 1,200,000. The Live Register rose above the new balancing point in September, 1924, and regular borrowing again became necessary.60. The rates of contribution and benefit have been repeatedly-changed, as shown by the statement in Appendix II. There was a sharp increase in contributions in July, 1921, from an aggregate of lOd. for an adult man to 18fd. This increase was to meet&apos;concessions granted by the two Acts of 1921, increasing the rates of benefit, for a short period, to 20s. in the case of men, increasing the maximum number of weeks for which benefit could be drawn from 15 to 26 weeks, and providing for &quot; uncovenanted
benefit &apos;&apos; or benefit in excess of that to which insured persons were entitled by virtue of contributions. Contributions were further increased to 25fd. in November, 1921, to meet the cost of additional benefit for dependants.61. Since 1924 the changes have been briefly as follows. The contribution revenue of the Fund was reduced by two stages. The Act of 1925 made a reduction of 4d. per week in the case of men (employers 2d., workers 2d.) to assist in floating the Contributory Pensions Scheme. The Act provided for an extra contribution from the Exchequer but, in its stead, the Economy Act of 1926 reduced the Exchequer contribution by fd. The total contribution revenue was thus reduced from 25fd., as it had existed since 1921, to 21d. per week. After allowing for the curtailments of benefits which were enacted at the same time, and by the Act of 1927, the revenue was sufficient only to cover expenditure while the live register did not exceed 1,000,000. Heavy demands were made on the Fund in 1926 and in the winter of 1928-29 and by June 1929, the Fund had borrowed  36,870,000. By the Act of 1929, the total contribution was increased to 22Jd. by increasing the Exchequer contribution to one-half of the joint contribution of employer and employed.62. The cost of transitional benefit is charged in the first instance to the Unemployment Fund but, by the 1930 Act, the Exchequer now makes a contribution to the Unemployment Fund equal to the cost of all transitional benefit paid to claimants and the cost of its administration. The effect of this has been to relieve the ordinary revenue of the Fund of about half the cost of transitional benefit in 1929-30 ( 3,985,000), and of the whole cost in 1930-31 which was estimated to amount to  22,000,000.The provision made in the estimate submitted to Parliament for the cost to the Exchequer of transitional benefit in the current financial year was  30 millions, on the present rates of benefit and conditions. This estimate is based on the assumption that transi-tional benefit will begin to expire in October, 1931.63. In addition to placing the cost of transitional benefit on the Exchequer and extending the transitional period, the Act of 1930 repealed the &quot; genuinely seeking work &quot; condition contained in the Act of 1924, and transitional condition (c).* It also increased the rates of benefit for young men and young women and raised the allowance for adult dependants from 7s. to 9s. There was no in-crease in contributions to meet the cost of these changes but, as stated above, the Fund was relieved of the cost of transitional benefit. In his evidence the Accountant General of the Ministry of Labour stated that the effect of these changes, so far as could then be ascertained, with a live register of about 2,300,000, was to increase the number of persons in receipt of benefit by about 180,000 and the annual cost by  13,000,000.* See para. 36.
64. It will be apparent from this brief summary that the out-standing debt of the Unemployment Fund is mainly due to (i) the increase in unemployment, (ii) the increase in rates of benefit with no corresponding increase in contributions, and (iii) the relaxation of the conditions for the receipt of benefit. The outstanding debt of the Fund on 23rd May, 1931, was  82,810,000. It has been borrowed at rates of interest varying between 4J and 5&amp; per cent, and the average rate for the debt outstanding is about 4f per cent. So long as the debt remains a liability of the Unemployment Fund the interest must be taken into account in assessing the balance of income and expenditure. The interest charge on so large a debt absorbs 2d. out of the total weekly contribution of 22ld.65. Under present conditions the income and expenditure of the Unemployment Fund balance when 900,000 persons^ are qualified for Insurance benefit. The decrease in contribution income is about  350,000 per annum for each 100,000 persons added to the Live Register while the increase in benefit paid is about  4,500,000. Assuming that the average Live Register is 2,500,000 the annual in-come of the Fund by contributions in respect of employed persons is as follows :  From employers ...      ...      ...      ...   15,650,000From employed persons        ...      ...      ...   13,650,000Froan the Exchequer............   14,850,000Other receipts   ...............       400,000 44,550,00066. The corresponding payments for Insurance benefit are esti-mated to amount to :  To the claimant............      ...   61,250,000Additional payment for dependants ...      ...   13,250,000Cost of administration.........       ...     5,000,000Interest on debt ...       ...      ...       ...     4,500,000 84,000,00067. The income of the Fund is thus little more than 50 per cent, of the expenditure on a Live Register of this size, the deficit being* 900,000 persons in receipt of Insurance benefit would correspond roughly with a &apos; live register&quot; of 1,275,000, of which the balance would consist of persons claiming transitional benefit, uninsured persons, and insured persons without a title to benefit.
 39,450,000. At this rate of unemployment, the beneficiaries are drawing out of the Unemployment Fund more than two and a half times the amount paid in contributions by employers and workers, without taMng into consideration the cost of transitional benefit. The additional cost of transitional benefit is estimated for a full year to amount to  35,000,000.COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT TO THE EXCHEQUER.68. Provision has been made in the 1931 Budget for the following payments by the Exchequer (apart from borrowing) :   &apos;Exchequer contribution to the Unemploy-ment Fund    ...............   15,108,000Transitional benefit     ............   30,000,000Total      ............ 45,108,000This estimate for transitional benefit is based on the assumption that such benefit will begin to expire in October, 1931. Under existing legislation the Fund may borrow up to a limit of  90,000,000.69. The Controller of Finance and Supply Services in Your Majesty&apos;s Treasury, in his evidence in January, 1931, showed that the cost of Unemployment Insurance to the Exchequer increased from  11,750,000 in .1928-29 to nearly  37,000,000 (estimated) in 1930-31. His evidence has been published separately but it is of such importance that we reproduce here an extract from it: &quot; Even in the most favourable conditions so great an in-crease, so swiftly incurred, would overtax the Budget. In present conditions it would, taken in conjunction with the other continuing liabilities of the State both for War debt and other-wise, not merely disturb, but entirely upset the equilibrium of the Budget on the basis of existing taxation. In 1931 revenue must be expected to fall; the extent of the fall cannot yet be estimated; the fall requires to be balanced, if equilibrium is to be preserved, by reduced expenditure. The large debt charge, however, representing this year 41 per cent, of the Budget, is fixed and savings in other branches of expenditure, such as would balance a great increase on any one item, can-not be obtained except by wide alterations of policies approved by Parliament.&quot; The amounts borrowed by the Fund from the Treasury in the last three years and the amount that may be similarly
borrowed in 1931 on the basis of existing conditions are follows : Year commencing 1st April.	Debt at commencement.	Net Borrowing during year.	 	 	Millions.	Millions1928    ............	24-53	11-431929    .............	35-96	2-991930..........    ...	38-95	33 to 36*1931 (conjectural amount on	72 to 75	40 to 50basis of existing situation).		The fluctuations in the extent of unemployment contrasted with the uniform rate of accrual of the income of the Fund renders it inevitable that the current revenue of the Fund will at some times be more than adequate and at other times less than adequate to meet current outgoings. It follows that according to orthodox canons the Fund should possess a reserve to meet periods of stress; for State borrowing for an unproduc-tive purpose i.e., an object not producing a monetary yield which will provide the service of the loan such as the pro-vision of money for unemployment benefit, is recognised to be unsound. In the conditions of to-day that position is un-attainable. On the other hand continued State borrowing on the present vast scale without adequate provision for re-payment by the Fund would quickly call in question the stability of the British financial system. The State has every year to borrow large sums for various productive purposes. This additional borrowing for purposes other than productive  is now on a scale which in substance obliterates the effect of the Sinking Fund. Apart from the impairment of Govern-ment credit which such operations inevitably involve these vast Treasury loans are coming to represent in effect State borrow-ing to relieve current State obligations at the expense of the future and this is the ordinary and well-recognised sign of an unbalanced Budget.&quot;70. The Controller also drew attention to the Exchequer charge for Unemployment Insurance in relation to the total expenditure from National Funds on Social Services. Excluding War Pen-sions, the contribution of the State to Social Services has increased since 1910 from  28,500,000 to  126,000,000 in 1927 and to  158,600,000 (estimated) in 1930. The increase has been rapid in the last three years and this is attributed to the effect of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1929 and 1930.* The amount borrowed in the year commencing 1st April 1930 was  36,440,000.
71. If account be taken also of loans to the Unemployment Fund the growth of the charge for Unemployment Insurance is still more pronounced. In the last financial year borrowing amounted to  36,440,000. If this sum were included, the total State contributions to Social Services for 1930-31 would be raised to about  195,000,000, and the contribution to Unemployment In-surance alone would be  73,000,000 or 37 per cent, of the whole.v-interim measures.THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SCHEME.72. We are asked under the first head of our terms of reference to make recommendations with regard to the means by which the Unemployment Insurance Scheme may be made &quot; solvent and self-supporting.&quot; In the circumstances of the present time, this appears to us to be an objective which cannot be fully realised with-out much greater changes in the provisions of the Scheme than we are prepared to recommend. Nor do we think that its attainment is the sole or even the principal consideration to which we should have regard.73. Nevertheless, we believe it to be of great importance that immediate measures should be taken to arrest the deterioration of the Scheme. The grounds for this view are partly financial. But we are concerned also with the preservation of the principles upon which, in our opinion, any insurance scheme must rest. In re-lation to unemployment, the word &quot; insurance &quot; might cover many types of scheme : and later we may have to propose considerable changes in the present system. But since the inception of Un-employment &quot; Insurance &quot; a distinction has been recognised between one form of provision that form in which payments to beneficiaries are based upon and related to their con-tributions and other forms. We think that this distinc-tion is essential to the principle of insurance against un-employment and that it is worth maintaining. Apart from all other considerations, some of them of great social importance, it has the advantage that it allows benefit to be paid on proof of unem-ployment, without enquiry into the means or needs of applicants, whereas we find it difficult to conceive that a similar freedom can attend the payment of benefits otherwise provided. Clearly the present situation imperils this basis. Hence, even to meet present conditions, we prefer to frame proposals which take account of the distinction implied in the principles on which the existing Scheme was founded, rather than to jeopardise the chances of main-taining those principles by a further departure from the original conception of Insurance.74. In our interim measures we are not attempting to meet all contingencies in such a way that, whatever changes may occur in the volume of unemployment, the Scheme on its present basis may
be self-supporting. It would be easy to suggest that the present position should be dealt with by charging upon the Exchequer the balance of the cost of benefit which cannot be covered by the con-tributions of employers and workers. It would, of course, be less easy to suggest ways in which the Exchequer could find the money out of the current Revenue of the country without seriously reducing the funds available for industry and for other social services. We shall have to consider in greater detail for our final Report the inci-dence of the cost of benefit under a permanent Unemployment In-surance Scheme. For the moment we are concerned with practical measures to meet present-day facts.75. The finances of the Unemployment Fund are at present adjusted so that income and expenditure balance when 900,000 workers are in receipt of Insurance benefit. Since the end of 1929, the number of persons unemployed has far exceeded this number and the actual income of the Fund has been only slightly more than half the actual expenditure. As we have stated in para-graph 20, there is no assurance that the volume of unemployment is likely to fall in the near future to anything approaching the 1929 level, and, bearing in mind the experience in recent years, we do not feel justified in assuming an average level of unemploy-ment for the year 1931-32 of less than 2,500,000. Assuming that the number of workers claiming Insurance benefit under the exist-ing conditions would be about 1,750,000, and that the number of workers claiming transitional benefit would be about 600,000, the cost of ordinary and transitional benefit paid to-day on figures of these dimensions would be about  119,000,000 per annum, of which approximately  84,000,000 would be in respect of Insurance benefit and interest on debt and  35,000,000 in respect of tran-transitional benefit. The annual income of the Fund with an average Live Register of 2,500,000 would be about  44,550,000, so that on this basis a debit balance of  39,450,000 has to be dealt with, apart from the cost of transitional benefit.Borrowing.76. The present position is that a large part of current expenditure is treated not as a charge on current revenue, but as a loan to be repaid out of the receipts of the Unemployment Fund. Neither the past record of the Fund, which has incurred a deficit in eight years out of the last ten, nor the future prospects of employment, afford any justification for perpetuating this dangerous fiction. Borrowing on behalf and on the security of the Fund is not, in principle, objectionable, if the purpose of the borrowing be to meet a temporary emergency, under circumstances which dis-close a reasonable promise of early liquidation of the debt. But it is quite clear that recent borrowing has not been of this character. It has been on a scale far exceeding the probable capacity of the
Fund to repay and the debt is now increasing annually at a rate which equals the annual income of the Fund.77. Pending our final Report we make no recommendation for dealing with the accumulated debt. But whatever may have been the position in the past it is plain that the Fund is in no position now to borrow on its own security on any considerable scale. It is there-fore important that borrowing on behalf of the Fund should, as nearly as possible, cease, and that the liabilities of the Fund, as such, should be restricted to those which can substantially be met from its current income. We recognise that the acceptance of this principle means that, for the time being, the Unemployment Fund will not be able to provide Insurance benefit for so large a number of unemployed workers as at present, and that there will be an in-crease in the numbers receiving transitional benefit at the direct cost of the Exchequer: We are of opinion, however, that this transfer of a larger proportion of the cost to be borne by the current year&apos;s Revenue is in accordance with the principles of sound finance and this view, we believe, accords with the state-ment of policy given by the Controller of Finance and Supply Services in Your Majesty&apos;s Treasury, which we have in part quoted in paragraph 69.We suggest, therefore, measures for dealing with the present situation which would substantially reduce the rate of borrowing. For the rest, we have thought it right to confine our interim pro-posals to those which can be put into effect without any funda-mental change in the basis or administrative structure of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.78. The difference between income and expenditure may be re-duced by the savings to be expected from the steps which we suggest should be taken to remove certain anomalies. We are not able at this stage to suggest alterations in the general con-ditions for the receipt of benefit so that, apart from savings due to the removal of anomalies, and excluding borrowing, there are only three methods by which the deficit can immediately be reduced. They are : (1) by a reduction of the period for which benefit is paid; (2) by an increase of contributions; (3) by a reduction of benefit.79. With a live register of 2,500,000 and allowing for a maxi-miim saving of 10 per cent, by the elimination of certain classes of claims, we find that the ordinary income of the Unemploy-ment Fund would meet the cost of insurance benefit : (a) If no change be made in the rates of contribution or of benefit but the maximum period for which benefit can be drawn be reduced to 10 weeks in a period of 12 months;
(b) if no change be made in the rates of benefit or in the period of benefit, but rates of contributions be increased 100 per cent.;(c) if no change be made in the period of benefit or in the rates of contribution, but rates of benefit be reduced by an average of 55 per cent.It is impracticable to employ any one of these courses to the ex-clusion of the other two, and in our view such an approach to sol-vency as is practicable at this time can best be obtained by a reasonable combination of all three methods.The Period of Benefit.80. It is inherent in any scheme of insurance that the contin-gency to be covered by the policy shall be defined as precisely as possible. In most types of insurance this may not be difficult, because the definition of the contingency acquires common form. In the case of unemployment it is by no means easy, for unemploy-ment takes many forms, from the occasional loss of a day&apos;s work to continued involuntary idleness lasting over months and years without definite signs of termination. We cannot conceive of an insurance scheme within the meaning of our terms of refer-ence, which will cover the mere fact of unemployment, without a limiting definition both of time and circumstances, if the scheme is to be fair to the general body of contributors.81. Under existing conditions it is only by the operation of the 30 contributions rule that any limit is placed upon the period during which benefit can be drawn. We have shown (para. 35) that this rule was intended to be safeguarded by other conditions which are now repealed. In the absence of such conditions and on the present financial basis, we think it impossible for the Scheme to continue to permit so unrestricted a currency of claim. Hence, given the present easy qualifying contribution condition, as to which at present we suggest no change, we think it would be reasonable to restrict the payment of Insurance benefit to 26 weeks in a period of 12 months following the application. This period of benefit will cover the ordinary short term unemployment which, even in these days, constitutes the great bulk of unemployment. About six-sevenths of those now in receipt of Insurance benefit would be un-affected by this limit; the remainder would be transferred to tran-transitional benefit and we later deal with their position.Rates of Contributions.82. The most direct method of restoring solvency to the Unem-ployment Pund would be by increasing contributions. An increase of Id.in the worker&apos;s contribution for an adult male, with proportionate increases for other classes, would increase the annual income of the Fund by  2,000,000; since the present contributions are  fixed
approximately on the basis of equal thirds for each of the contribution-in &apos; parties, this would secure a total increase in income of  6 000,000. Any substantial increase in contributions, however, would not in our view be advisable in the present circumstances of British industry.83. The employees contribution is, like wages, ah element in direct costs which have to be paid before the product has been dis-posed of and without reference to the profit or loss resulting from the employment of the insured contributor. On the other hand the difficulty of financing the relief of unemployment on its present scale is so great that it is impossible to rule out this method altogether.The level of contributions cannot be considered by itself and apart from other features of an insurance scheme. Relatively high contributions may be acceptable if the purpose of the expendi-ture and the conditions under which it is incurred command sub-stantial approval, whereas an absence of confidence in the general conditions of a scheme may cause the weight of contributions to appear oppressive. Moreover it is important to remember that alternative methods of raising additional revenue for this purpose also have their disadvantages, especially the increase of taxation on funds that might otherwise be applied to the creation of further employment.84. With regard to the worker&apos;s contribution, a substantial in-crease might be defended on the grounds that the risk of unemploy-ment has increased and that the insured contributors are the main and the only direct beneficiaries of the Insurance Scheme. We believe that such an increase would readily be accepted by those whose earnings are substantial. But we recognise that it would be a heavy burden for those who are working short time or at com-paratively low rates of wages. We therefore limit our immediate proposals to the restoration for an adult male worker of the rate of contribution in force in 1924, and we recommend that the employer&apos;s and the Exchequer contributions should be raised to the same figure.85. The rates of contributions which we recommend for all classes are set out in the following table : Class of Employed Person.	Employees Contri-bution.	Employed Person&apos;s Contri-bution.	Exchequer Contri-bution.	Total.	d.	d.	d.	d.Man (21-64)    .........	9	9	9	27Woman (21-64)          ......	8	8	8	24Young Man (18-21)   ......	8	8	8	24Young Woman (18-21)	7	7	7	21Boy (L6-18)    .........	4i	44	44	134Girl (16-18)    .........	4	4	4	12
86. These proposals will mean an additional Id. from the em-ployer, an additional 2d. from the worker and an additional lid. from the Exchequer in respect of the adult male worker, with appro-priate increases for other classes. The increased income which will result from these changes will be approximately  9,000.000 per annum.Rates of Benefit. 87. If the above changes in the duration of benefit and the rates of contribution are made, then, in our view, the most favourable rates of benefit which the income of the Eund can provide are as follows : Ordinary Rates of Benefit.Age.	Males.	Females	s.	9.Over 21        ......	...:&apos; ... : ... &apos; 15	1318-21  ...	.........   12	1017-18.........	.........     7	616-17.........	.........     5	5Dependants&apos; Benefit.Rate of additional benefit for an adult dependant, 8s. per week.Rate of additional benefit for a dependent child, 2s. per week. We accordingly recommend that these rates should be adopted.88. It is with reluctance that we have to suggest a reduction in existing rates of benefit. For every reason we desire to maintain the rates of benefit at the highest possible level. Obviously by raising contributions still further, and by further shortening the period of benefit, it would be possible to provide higher benefit rates than those which we recommend. But for reasons which we have given we believe that, in both these directions, our recommenda-tions go as far as in present circumstances they can properly be carried. We have sought to arrange the rates in such a way that in general the reduction will fall less heavily on the wage earners who have to support a home.89. Our recommendation, therefore, is directed towards providing benefits as high as, on the finances of the Scheme, they can pru-dently be put. To fix them at a higher rate would be to confuse Insurance and relief. At the same time we think it desirable to add two further observations. The first is that there is no warrant for the assumption that unemployment benefit is or ever has been intended to provide full maintenance. One of the questions we shall have to consider in a reconstructed scheme is whether or not full maintenance is a desirable objective, but it has not been a part of the present Scheme nor is it in fact the case that State unem-ployment benefit is the only resource of the unemployed worker. We have shown earlier in this Report that the rate of unemployment benefit was originally a low rate based upon trade union practice and designed merely to supplement a worker&apos;s savings during a shown -t and temporary period of unemployment.   With the introduction of
illdependants&apos; benefit in 1921, a new element was introduced into the situation, but at no time down to the present day can we find any authoritative acceptance of the view that unemployment benefit was intended to be sufficient to provide full maintenance. The Blanes-burgh Committee, in 1927, laid down that the rate of benefit must not be such as to tempt to improvidence, and that it must be definitely less in amount than the general labourer&apos;s rate of wages. On the other hand they took the view that ideal benefits &quot; should certainly be so substantial that the insured contributor can feel that, if he has the misfortune to need them, then, taken in con-junction with such resources as may reasonably, in the generality of cases, be expected to have been built up, they will be sufficient to prevent him from being haunted while at work by the fear of what must happen to him if he is unemployed &quot;. They added that, subject to these considerations, &quot; the amount of benefit must depend upon the contributions that can fairly be called for &quot;.90. Our second observation is that the present rates of benefit were fixed at a time of considerably less unemployment and of higher price levels. We attach in Appendix I a table supplied by the Ministry of Tjabour which compares past and present rates of benefit, having regard to changes in the cost-of-living. If a com-parison be made between the rates of benefit paid in August, 1924, in 1928, and now proposed by us, with adjustments corresponding to changes in the cost of living as shown by the Ministry of Labour cost-of-living index, the results are as follows : --	Single man.

91. It will Be clear that the rates which we propose are, in effect, higher than those in operation in the more prosperous years of 1924 and 1928, and it will be admitted generally that industry and the Exchequer are not now better able to support the higher rates than they then were.An estimate of the effect of our recommendations on the finances of the Unemployment Fund will be found in paragraph 127 below.TRANSITIONAL BENEFIT.92. The present transitional provisions begin to expire on 18th October, 1931. This does not mean that benefit will be dis-allowed on that date for all workers in this class. Persons now receiving transitional benefit will continue to receive it after October until the expiration of a year from the date of their claim. The termination of transitional benefit would therefore be spread over twelve months. In the absence of alternative arrange-in ents, those persons disqualified for transitional benefit, who had no other resources, would be obliged to apply to the Poor Law Authorities for relief. The cost to Poor Law Authorities would not be a sum equal to the amount of saving to the Exchequer. As we have explained in paragraph 48, of the increase of 160,000 in the recipients of transitional benefit which followed upon the 1930 Act, only 50,000 could be traced as coming from public assistance. Further, we have recently caused an enquiry to be made into the subsequent history of persons whose claims for benefit are disallowed. The enquiry shows that many of the persons disallowed benefit do not apply for out-door relief. We have no doubt, therefore, that if existing legislation were allowed to take effect and no new claims for transitional benefit were admitted after October, the increase in the number of persons applying for outdoor relief would be considerably less than the number of persons who ceased to draw transitional benefit. More-over, the scales of relief adopted by Poor Law Authorities are in the main below the scale of benefit, so that even where relief was granted the amount would in most cases be less. In the result it is clear that considerable savings could be effected in the present cost of maintaining persons outside the insurance scheme if they were to be transferred to Poor Law Authorities to be relieved on a basis of need. There are, however, other considerations to be borne in mind in that connection.93. The chief of these is that the existing burden of unemploy-ment upon Local Authorities is unevenly spread. Those districts which have been most severely hit by the loss of export trade are already committed to a serious financial burden in respect of relief granted to those able-bodied unemployed workers who are not qualified for benefit. To transfer the whole cost of relieving those now in receipt of transitional benefit to Poor Law Authorities in such
areas unaided might be to place an insupportable burden upon the ratepayers and to make it even more difficult for industry in those areas to regain lost markets and so re-employ some of the workers who are now idle. It is true that some Poor Law Authorities would be prepared to take over the responsibility of dealing with workers who fall outside the provisions of an unemployment insurance scheme, but all alike state that if extra charges are put upon them they must largely be met by increased Exchequer contributions to local funds. There would therefore be immediately involved a considerable problem of adjusting central and local finance.94. In these circumstances we are not prepared, in advance of our consideration of a permanent scheme, to suggest that transi-tional benefit should terminate in October 1931. We accordingly recommend, as an interim measure, and subject to the modified conditions which we suggest below, that the transitional period should be extended.Rates of Transitional Benefit.95. We see no reason at the present stage for proposing that workers in receipt of transitional benefit should receive less than the lower rates of benefit we have recommended for the worker in receipt of ordinary benefit. We therefore recommend that the rates of transitional benefit should be fixed at the scale we have recommended for Insurance benefit in para. 87.Conditions for the Receipt of Transitional Benefit.96. But if we make no differentiation in the rate of benefit we think it reasonable to make some further differentiation in condi-tions. Transitional benefit is paid outside the limits of the Insur-anoe Scheme proper. Even the slightly stricter contribution condition which we propose below provides little more than a formal test of the beneficiary&apos;s inclusion within the industrial field. Benefit paid on such a basis partakes more of the character of unemployment relief than of Unemployment Insurance and we see no reason why such payment should be made without some regard to means or needs. But for the moment and, prim-arily, because of the difficulty of devising suitable administrative machinery for the scrutiny of a very large number of claims, we do not propose to apply new conditions except to a limited group of specified classes.97. At present a worker who has paid eight contributions in two years or thirty contributions at any time may qualify for transitional benefit, if he satisfies the other conditions. We are of opinion that this lenient condition admits to benefit persons who have ceased to be within the industrial field and have become a
social rather than an industrial problem. We recommend there-fore that the qualifying contribution condition for transitional benefit should be as follows : that a claimant to transitional benefit shall be required to prove, at the beginning of each benefit quarter, that he has paid not less than 8 contributions during the period of two years, or not less than 30 contributions during the period of six years, immediately preceding the date of the application for benefit.98. We estimate that not more than 40,000 claimants spread all over the country will be affected by this alteration of the qualifying condition. It has been a principle from the beginning that there must be a qualifying contribution condition for the receipt of benefit, and clearly any such condition is bound to exclude some claimants. As we have shown, not all the claimants who are disallowed will have recourse to the Poor Law. But, even if our proposals should result in certain areas in an increase in the number of persons making claims for relief, we think this preferable to the continuance of the payment of benefit from the Unemployment Pund to persons who over the last six years have not succeeded in paying on an average more than five contributions a year, and who maintain their claim to benefit in virtue of a qualification acquired by reason of contributions paid more than six years ago.99. There are certain classes of workers who are prima facie not in the same need of rehef as the general body of workers. For these classes we are of opinion that transitional benefit should not be paid without some enquiry and that the amount of benefit should be related to their circumstances. The following are the classes of claimants to whom we recommend that this provision should apply : (1) Single persons (both young persons aged 18-21 and adults including widows and widowers without dependent children) who are residing with parents or relatives to whom, having regard to all the circumstances, they could reasonably look for support during unemployment.(2) Married women living with their husbands who are in employment and whose incomings are sufficient to justify the withholding of transitional benefit from the wife. A similar limitation should also be applied to married men whose wives are in employment.(3) Persons who are in receipt of Workmen&apos;s Compensation; Service pensions (other than for War disability); and other fixed income (other than income from savings).100. These classes of claimants for transitional benefit should be required to prove that, having regard to their circumstances, it is expedient that benefit should be paid to them.   The decision
whether transitional benefit should be paid to such claimants, and, if so at what rates, should be made by statutory authorities sitting locally with a final appeal in suitable cases to a higher authority covering a larger area. We do not think it necessary to indicate in detail the procedure which might be adopted, but we would suggest that, while local assessors might be used, these questions should not be referred either to the Courts of Referees or to the Umpire. We recommend that the Minister of Labour should prescribe the general principles to be followed by the local assessors in determining the amount of benefit to be paid in each case. The existing statutory authori-ties should, of course, continue to decide whether the claimant satisfies the rest of the statutory conditions and is not subject to disqualification.101. It appears to us also to be desirable to make some change in the conditions affecting the position of workers who are offered suitable employment after a long continuous period during which they have done no work in their usual occupation. It was pro-vided in the Act of 1927 (Section 5 (2) ) that, after the lapse of such an interval as is reasonable, employment should not be deemed to be unsuitable by reason only that it is employment of a kind other than employment in the claimant&apos;s usual occupation. We are not satisfied, however, that this requirement which applies equally to all claimants is, as at present interpreted, sufficiently effective in the case of workers in receipt of transitional benefit. We accordingly recommend that the form of condition which was in operation for &quot; extended benefit &quot; before the 1927 Act, should be re-introduced for transitional benefit, i.e. that transitional benefit should not. be paid to workers who refuse to accept on fair terms and conditions work other than that to which they were accustomed but which they are reasonably capable of performing.102. It has been suggested that recipients of transitional benefit are less favourably placed, as regards the offer of suitable employ -ment, than are workers in receipt of ordinary insurance benefit. We are satisfied that as regards the Employment Exchanges there is no such discrimination. The Exchange officials are equally active on their behalf as on behalf of those workers in receipt of ordinary benefit. We regard it as the most important part of the treat-ment of the recipients of transitional benefit that every effort should be made to rehabilitate them in suitable industrial employ-ment, and we have every confidence that the efforts of the Ex-changes will be continued.ANOMALIES.103. Much attention has been directed to certain provisions of the scheme which give rise to what have been commonly termed the &apos;&apos; abuses &apos;&apos; of the Acts but which may more fairly be called
&quot; anomalies.&quot; It is difficult to make provision in an Act of Par-liament for unanticipated problems, and it is not surprising that the general provisions of a scheme which is designed to deal with the normal type of unemployment should, in (their application to an infinite variety of individual circumstances, operate in some cases in a way which was not within the intention of the Legis-lature. We wish to make it clear that the classes of claims which have been criticised as not properly within an insurance scheme are permissible under existing legislation. Moreover, as we shall show later, some of them arise out of long standing provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts which have only recently been called in question.104. The seriousness of these anomalies lies in : (1) the unnecessary expenditure from public funds to which employers, workers and the State have contributed; (2) their effect on the repute of the scheme ; (3) their encouragement of methods of industrial organisa-tion which may be harmful to trade and employment in general. No comment is necessary as regards (1) and (2).     As regards (3), we  consider that  sufficient  attention has not been given in recent years to the effect of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme on industrial organisation, and the economic life of the country. One of the cardinal principles which was present in the minds of those  who framed  the original  Scheme in 1911 was that State provision for the unemployed should not be such as to create unemployment, and that it should, so far as possible, be associated with measures tending to diminish unemployment by improving the organisation of the employment market.   The prevention of unemployment is of more importance than its relief, and Unem-ployment Insurance should be subordinate to the encouragement of industry to reduce unemployment.105. The classes of claimants to which our attention has been particularly directed in this respect are as follows :  (a) intermittent, short-time, and casual workers,(b) married women,(c) seasonal workers.Intermittent, Short-time and Casual Workers.106. There is a considerable body of workers who work for one, two or three days in a week, and by virtue of contributions paid for these short spells of employment, qualify for Insurance benefit in respect of other days in the week. Some of these workers may be in receipt of high earnings for the work done; others receive only a proportion of a normal week&apos;s wages. We have pointed out that before the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1927, Insurance benefit was directly related to contributions (so (that benefit was limited to a fixed
number of days for a fixed number of contributions), and there was also a limitation upon the amount of benefit which could be drawn in a year. There is at present no such limitation upon the amount of benefit which can be drawn by a person who has paid thirty contributions in two years, and the only restriction is to be found in the continuity rule which lays down that a day of unemploy-ment shall count for benefit purposes if it is one of at least three days of unemployment occurring within a period of six consecutive days. Benefit is not paid, for example, to a worker who is un-employed regularly for one day a week only or for the same two days in each successive week.107. It has always been a deliberate part of the policy of Un-employment Insurance to permit the &quot; linking-up &quot;, into a &quot; con-tinuous period &quot;, of short periods of unemployment which would, by themselves, not constitute periods of sufficient duration to qualify for the receipt of unemployment benefit. Many of the anomalies arise out of the operation of fhe present continuity rules. The present rule has been in operation since 1923 when it was amended in order to enable casual dock workers to qualify for benefit for broken periods of employment. The practice of short-time working has also been recognised and encouraged by Government, as a means of meeting trade depression which was regarded incorrectly as we see now as temporary.108. The continuity rule has an important effect on the permanent prospects of employment, since it must either encourage or dis-courage the concentration of the available work on the smallest number of more or less fully employed workpeople. The present continuity rule appears to encourage industries to maintain reserves far in excess of their maximum requirements, at the expense of the Unemployment Fund. Thus the dock industry shows a normal un-employment percentage of over 30 ; in the building industry, while employment has expanded by 21.8 per cent, in the last seven years, unemployment also increased and averaged 16.3 per cent, in 1930. In the cotton industry and in. textile finishing the number of workers dependent on the industry shows no contraction in spite of a reduction of exports by a half, the workers being retained in the industry largely by short-time working. In coal mining the sub-sidising of short-time also favours the retention of workers in districts where the demand for their regular labour has disappeared. The obstacle to trade improvement created by these practices was clearly stated in the evidence of the Ministry of Labour. *Intermittent Workers.109. By the term &quot; intermittent workers &quot; we mean those workers who habitually find their employment in occupations which* Paper No. 8, Page 115 of the Fourth Day&apos;s Minutes of Evidence.
require their services for only one or two days in the week and often only for the week-end. As they pay contributions regularly they are able to satisfy the 30 contributions condition for Insur-ance benefit. Included in this class are, for example, some shop assistants; barmen; market porters; sandwichmen; bill distributors and certain workers in the printing and laundry-trades. An insurance scheme clearly cannot contemplate the regular payment of benefit to workers in occupations which are regularly intermittent. There are certain administra-tive difficulties in the way of excluding these employments from the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts and, in our view, it is better to proceed by examining the individual industrial records of these claimants rather than by attempting to treat them as an uninsured class. We accordingly recommend that no claimant shall be treated as unemployed within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, who habitually works for only two days or less in each week, and is unable to satisfy the, statu-tory authorities that he is normally employed in regular insurable employment for the other working days of the week. If this recommendation is adopted we think, in justice to these workers, that they should be given the right to apply for a certificate of exemption entitling them to be excused from the payment of con-tributions. In making this recommendation we are not proposing any amendment which will exclude persons following a subsidiary occupation as defined in the 1920 Act, Section 7 (2) (a).Casual Workers.110. Many workers, especially those engaged in the dock in-dustry, obtain their living by casual employment, and some of them receive high remuneration for one, two or three days&apos; work in a week, and benefit for the other days. We recognise that it may be necessary to devise special measures to deal with occu-pations characterised by a large amount of casual labour but, as an interim measure, we recommend that the casual worker should be treated in the same way as we propose for the short-time worker.Short-time Workers.111. The criticisms of the payment of benefit to short-time workers may be summarised as follows : (a) that it enables industries to maintain a reserve of labour at the cost of the contributors to the Unemployment Fund;(b) that it is equivalent to a subsidy of wages;(c) that many short-time workers receive benefit which they do not really need.With regard to (a) and (b) it must, however, be borne in mind that short-time working is a ready and convenient way of dealing with temporary unemployment, and further that the payment of benefit to two half-time workers does not immediately impose a
greater burden on the Fund than the payment of benefit to one worker who is wholly unemployed.112. Organised short-time working was the regular pre-war prac-tice of many industries, particularly coal-mining and the textile industries, but it was then an alternative to or a substitute for un-employment insurance, and was adopted only to meet temporary fluctuations in demand. No reliable statistics exist of the extent of short-time working to-day, but we are satisfied that it has been and continues to be extensively adopted. Instances have been given of the deliberate arrangement of working days and non-working days, to enable workers to take full advantage of the con-cessions contained in the continuity rules, and so to qualify for the maximum amount of benefit obtainable under the provisions of those rules. Such arrangements seem to us to be a natural consequence of the continuity rules, and one which must have been foreseen when the concessions were embodied in the Un-employment Insurance Acts. The Governmental encouragement of short-time working in the past, before unemployment had assumed its present degree of intensity and duration, does not necessarily justify the continuance of the existing continuity rules; nor does the fact that short-time working is a well-established practice necessarily justify the use of the Unemployment Fund to support that practice. One of the questions we shall have later to consider, therefore, is whether or not the continuity rules in their present form require amendment.113. The subject is one of great complexity. The experience to which we have referred above shows how difficult it is to devise a rule which will provide for the payment of benefit in cases where such payment is appropriate, i.e., in the case of unavoidable short-time working, without encouraging unnecessary resort to such a practice. At this stage, we can do no more than suggest a way of dealing with that part of the problem which arises in connection with claimants who are able to earn relatively high wages, although their work is confined to a part of the week, and to sup-complement these wages by benefit for the remaining days.114. The proposal which we make is that the present arrange-ments should be modified by the introduction of the principle of an overriding limitation. &quot;We suggest that, subject as now to the waiting period, benefit should be paid in respect of any three or more days of unemployment within a period of six consecutive days, but that the amount of benefit to be paid should be the usual amount due, subject to the following proviso : that in respect of any period comprising both days of employ-ment and days of unemployment, the amount of benefit pay-able for the days of unemployment shall be not more than the full amount of benefit which would be payable for the whole period less half the earnings received for the period. In ordinary circumstances the period of one week should be the basis of the calculation, but in the case of a short-time worker who
is employed alternate weeks, we recommend that the period to be taken for the purpose of this proviso should be a fortnight. The earnings to be taken into account should not include earnings from a subsidiary occupation as defined in Section 7 (2) (a) of the 1920 Act.The examples given in Appendix IV show how the formula will operate in the case of (a) a single man, and (b) a man, wife and two children, at the rates of benefit we have recommended.115. This rule is the only method which we can devise to effect the three results which we wish to achieve (a) to provide reasonable benefit for short time working where such working represents a loss of wages;(b) to prevent the payment of benefit in those cases of high earnings where no reasonable claim to benefit lies; and(c) to make it worth a man&apos;s while, whatever the amount of benefit to which he is entitled, to find or accept additional employment.116. We recognise that the rule introduces into the payment of Insurance benefit, a new consideration the amount of earnings. In this case, we see no objection in principle to this consideration, nor indeed do we think that the situation can be satisfactorily treated without it. A much more serious ground for hesitation is the administrative difficulties in giving effect to the formula, in-cluding the difficulty which the Exchanges are likely to find in ascertaining the earnings of claimants without incurring an undue delay in the payment of benefit. We believe that these difficulties are not insuperable. But even if they should compel some modifica-tion of the rule we propose, we think that it should be possible to-devise a procedure by which regard would be had, in determining the amount of benefit payable for the week, to the fact that earn-ings have Been received in respect of the period.Married Women.117. The position of married women workers under an unemploy-ment insurance scheme differs substantially from that of other insured contributors. It is a common, and perhaps a growing, px&apos;actice among employers to refuse to engage married women and to dismiss women from employment on marriage. It is also a common practice for women to withdraw from industry on marriage if&quot; their husbands are able to support them ; and again in many cases married women who might wish to seek employment are prevented by their domestic responsibilities from doing so. The number of women, aged 18 to 64 years, insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in July, 1930, was 2,880,000, of whom it is esti-mated that only 800,000 were married. In view of the fact that there are in G-reat Britain over 8,000,000 married women aged 18 to 64 years,  (as compared with 6,000,000 single women and
widows), it is clear that it is the exception rather than the rule for women after marriage to earn their living by insurable employment. It follows that in the case of married women as a class, industrial employment cannot be regarded as the normal condition. These facts must be re-membered in considering whether special provision should not be made for married women claimants under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.118. That is one principal consideration. A second is that, whereas the volume of unemployment among married women might have been expected to bear to the unemployment of women workers as a whole, approximately the same relation as the total number of married women workers bears to the total number - of women workers, the figures reveal a remarkable disparity. The evidence of the Ministry of Labour shows that whereas the number of insured married women is estimated to be between 25 and 30 per cent, of all insured women, the proportion of married women among the women claimants has for some time past been between 45 and 50 per cent. No explanation of this discrepancy can be found in the industrial circumstances of the areas in which the employment of married women is most common. The main increase followed the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1927, and this would seem to show that the new conditions for the receipt of benefit encouraged applications which would have been deterred by the previous restriction of benefit to one week in respect of six contributions.119. Eegard must, of course, be paid to the fact that many women work after marriage, especially in those districts and indus-tries where they are customarily employed in large numbers. But we cannot avoid the conclusion that under the present conditions, married women who have no wish to work have no difficulty in obtaining unemployment benefit, and we are satisfied on the evidence before us that there are many married women receiving benefit who have not since marriage worked in an insurable trade, and, in their existing circumstances, have no intention of doing so.120. In all the circumstances we are of opinion that, as an interim measure pending our final Report, the best method of eliminating those claims by married women which are not reasonable, is by requiring a married woman claimant, whenever the Insurance Officer thinks fit, to satisfy the Court of Referees, that she has not, as a result of marriage, withdrawn from industrial employment. We therefore recommend that a married woman shall be entitled to benefit only if she has satisfied the statutory authorities that  (1) she has not abandoned insurable employment;and (2) that having regard to her industrial experience and to the industrial circumstances of the district she can reasonably expect to obtain insurable employment in the district in which she is residing.
Expectant mothers.121. There is another aspect of the problem of dealing with claims made by married women to which in this interim Report we desire to call attention. Evidence has been put before us as to the difficulty experienced by Exchange Officers in dealing with expectant mothers. These women are often discharged by their employers some weeks before their confinement is expected&quot;, and they claim unemployment benefit. They state that they are fit for light work, and they often continue to claim until the birth of the child. It is in practice impossible for an Exchange Officer to submit a woman in this position for employment : she has given up one wage-earning occupation as being unfit to perform it, and she.is progressively unfit for any other. The question that arises is one of co-ordination between the National Health Insurance Scheme and the Unemployment Insurance Scheme. Married women contribute to both Funds, and when, owing to pregnancy, they are discharged from their employment, they expect to draw benefit from one Fund or the other. It is clear that a woman is not entitled to sickness benefit on account of pregnancy alone, hut only if the doctor is satisfied that she is &quot; incapable of work&quot;. On the other hand so long as she is capable of work she is entitled to unemployment benefit although she may not have the slightest chance of getting work. The matter was considered by the Royal Commission on National Health Insurance and certain recommendations with regard to it appear in their Report. We understand that the Ministry of Health has under consideration the general question of the provision to be made for women during pregnancy and childbirth, and we hope that, pending our final Report, it will be possible to find a solution to this problem which will be satisfactory to the women concerned and will, at the same time, relieve the Employment Exchanges and the Unemploy-ment Fund of a burden which in our view they should not be called upon to bear.Seasonal Workers.122. The position regarding seasonal workers has been defined to us by the Ministry of Labour as follows : &apos;&apos; The term &apos; seasonal workers &apos; is used to cover two different classes of case (1) where there is a busy season alternating with a slack season during which, nevertheless, some employ-ment in the trade is available, and (2) where the work is of a wholly seasonal character, beginning and ending on some more or less definite date and there is no work of the same sort available for the rest of the year.Examples of the first class are the building, clothing, and certain other trades. There are large numbers in this class, which - represents one of the main types of unemployment for which the insurance scheme was intended to provide.   On general
grounds it is clearly desirable that everything possible should be done in these trades to reduce seasonal fluctuations to the minimum. So far as the Unemployment Insurance Scheme is concerned, the main consideration is that the provisions of the scheme should be so designed that they do not unduly favour methods of engagement of labour and methods of working which are uneconomic and against the general interest.The second class of case, that is where the work is of a wholly seasonal character beginning and ending on some more or less definite date, comprises workers who, while their main occupation is the seasonal one, do seek, and in fact sometimes obtain, employment during the off-season.The problem as regards the second class is to make sure that workers who hold themselves out as seeking work during the off-season really are available to take it. The Umpire has said that, where the only work available in the district is the seasonal work, applicants must be held to be not available for work during&quot; the off-season if their domestic circumstances prevent them from taking work at a distance from home. There are a number of cases, however, where this would not provide an infallible test. The persons in respect of whom difficulty may be experienced may be considered under three main heads, namely : (a) persons employed at seaside and other holiday resorts;(b) fish curers;(c) others, such as jam workers, mineral water workers, fruit canners and persons employed in local seasonal industries such as toy making. &quot;*123. Before the Act of 1930 came into force, claimants who worked only during the seasonal periods were, as a rule, disallowed benefit during the &apos;&apos; off-season &apos;&apos; on the grounds that they were not &quot; genuinely seeking work.&quot; It was indeed so far recognised that employment of this kind by itself would not, as a rule, entitle the worker to benefit, that provision was made, in the Act of 1927, whereby a person whose occupation was seasonal and did not ordinarily extend beyond 18 weeks in the year, could voluntarily obtain a certificate exempting him from payment of his share of contributions. In exercise of this power 2,132 workers had been granted certificates up to 31st December, 1929, distributed mainly between the three classes mentioned above.124. Under the easier conditions which have prevailed since the Act of 1930 came into force, it is possible for many seasonal workers who obtain enough contributions to qualify them for Insurance benefit, to receive benefit each year during the whole period of the off-season. Many of the certificates of exemption which were obtained in 1929 have been cancelled on the application of the workers concerned.* Paper No. 6, page 96, Third day&apos;s Minutes of Evidence.
125. In our view a worker, who habitually obtains his (or her) living for the year, by work in a seasonal occupation for a part of the year, should not be deemed to be unemployed and qualified for benefit during that part of the year which is the off-season. We therefore recommend that a seasonal worker should be entitled to benefit in respect of unemployment occurring within the season subject to the general conditions applying to all claimants, but that during the off-season a claimant who, from his industrial record, appears to the Insurance Officer to be a seasonal worker, should not be entitled to benefit unless he can prove to the satisfaction of the Court of Referees (a) that he has in the past worked in the off-season for a reasonable time in some insurable occupation; and(b) that having regard to the industrial circumstances of the district, he can reasonably expect to obtain insurable work in the off-season in the district in which he is residing.FINANCIAL EFFECT OF RECOMMENDATIONS.126. As stated in paragraph 20, we are basing our estimates of the finances of Unemployment Insurance upon an assumed average live register of 2,500,000, representing 1,750,000 persons claiming Insurance benefit and 600,000 persons claiming transi-tional benefit. On this basis we now proceed to set out the finances of our proposals for a full year.127. It is difficult to estimate precisely the effect of some of the changes, but the estimates given have been made after consulta-tion with the Government Actuary and the Accountant General of the Ministry of Labour. The savings to be effected and the other changes will not be sufficient to cover the deficit on a year&apos;s operation of the scheme, even if transitional benefit be excluded. They would, however, make the scheme balance if the number of persons to be provided for were 200,000 less than we have assumed. On the basis we have taken, a Live Register of 2,500,000, a balance of income and expenditure could not be achieved without changes more drastic than we have felt justified in making as interim and therefore necessarily temporary measures. Our recommendations were indeed reached, not solely by seeking a financial saving under each head, but by an examina-tion of the circumstances under which benefit is being paid. They are directed to adjusting the scheme to changes in the general economic situation and to eliminating obvious anomalies. It should be noted that of the deficit of  7,650,000, interest on the debt accounts for  4,500,000.Much as we regret the necessity of increasing the charge upon the Exchequer, even as an interim measure, we consider that this course is inevitable within the practical limits of our task. Our recommendations substantially reduce the total cost of Insurance
and transitional benefit and they arrest the rate of increase of debt. In our view no other course is open unless there is to be a continued postponement, by the further accumulation of debt, of the necessity of facing the true facts.I-THE INSURANCE SCHEME (excluding transitional benefit).

VI.-SUMMARY.128. It will be convenient to summarise the main considerations immediately before us and the interim measures which we recom-inend.I. It has not been possible for us to make a complete study of all the questions which should be taken into account before the basis of a satisfactory permanent scheme of Unemployment Insurance can be determined. We have, however, been pressed to present an interim Report on the following questions : (1) the increasing indebtedness of the Unemployment Fund ;(2) the   increasing   cost   of   transitional   benefit   to   the Exchequer;(3) the suggestion that benefit is paid in circumstances which the scheme was not intended to cover.II. The income of the Unemployment Fund is only sufficient to meet half the charges upon it. The present debt of the Fund exceeds  80 millions and is increasing by nearly  1 million every week.III. The cost of transitional benefit, falling directly on the Exchequer, is estimated at  30 millions for the present year and may exceed that sum; in addition, the Exchequer has to find about  15 millions as the State contribution to the Unemployment Fund.IV. This situation, though aggravated by the serious rise in unemployment during the past 18 months, has been steadily developing over several years. The risk of unemployment for which the Insurance Scheme has to provide has been repeatedly undervalued, and only for short intervals has there been any proper approximation of expenditure to income. The extent of the financial liabilities being incurred has been concealed by successive&quot; borrowings on the security of a Fund that is sinking deeper and deeper into debt.V. For our interim Report we have thought it right to take the situation as we find it; to accept, at present, the existing structure of the Insurance Scheme, and to endeavour to discharge the duty placed upon us by the first part of our terms of reference. Similarly we have thought it proper for a Report dealing largely with a grave financial position, to take the present facts of the extent of unem-ployment and not to build upon some conjectural and rapid improvement of industrial prospects.VI. With regard to the anomalies or &quot; abuses,&quot; we have con-fined our recommendations mainly to those cases which have excited public misgiving and which can be corrected without serious hardship, and without serious prejudice to the principles which we may find it desirable to propose for a permanent scheme.
129. The following is a summary of the measures which we recommend to deal with the present situation pending our final Eeport.I. The Unemployment Insurance Scheme (paras. 72-91.) In order that the income and expenditure of the Unemployment Fund may be brought more closely to balancing point with a Live Eegister of 2,500&apos;,000 we recommend : (1) A limit upon the period for which benefit may be paid of 26 weeks within the period of 12 months following the date of application.(2) An increase in the weekly rates of contributions so that, in the case of the adult man, each of the three parties (the worker, the employer and the Exchequer) pays 9d., with appropriate increases in the rates of contribution for other classes.(3) An amendment of the weekly rates of unemployment benefit in accordance with the following scale :  Ordinary Rates of Benefit.Age. Males.s.Over 21 18-21  ... 17-18   ... 16-17   ... -Dependants Benefit.Eate of additional 8s. per week.Eate of additional benefit for a dependent child, 2s. per week.15 12 7 5Females.s. 13 1065benefit  for  an adult  dependant,II. Transitional Benefit (paras. 92-102). We recommend that the existing transitional provisions should be continued, subject to the following amendments : (1) The rates of transitional benefit should be fixed at the scale we have recommended for Insurance benefit.(2) A claimant for transitional benefit should be required to prove, at the beginning of each benefit quarter, that he has paid not less than 8 contributions during the preceding two years, or not less than 30 contributions during the period of six years immediately preceding the date of his application.(3) That the amount of benefit to be paid to certain classes of workers (specified in paragraph 99) should be considered in relation to certain of their other resources.(4) That a worker should not be allowed transitional benefit who refuses to accept, on fair terms and conditions an offer of work suited to his capacities.
III. Anomalies (paras. 103-125).We make the following recommendations to deal with unreason-able claims (whether for benefit under the Insurance Scheme or for transitional benefit), that are adding to expenditure and bringing the scheme into disrepute : (1) Workers who habitually work for only two days or less in each week and are unable to satisfy the statutory authorities that they are normally employed in regular insurable employ-ment for the other days of the week should not be regarded as unemployed within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Acts. This class of worker should be given the right to apply for a certificate of exemption (paragraph 109).(2) Casual workers and short-time workers in receipt of high earnings should be entitled to benefit in accordance with the formula set out in paragraph 114.(3) A married woman should be entitled to benefit only if she has satisfied the statutory authorities (a) that she has not abandoned insurable employment; and (b) that having regard to her industrial experience ani to the industrial circumstances of the district, she can reasonably expect to obtain insurable employment in the district in which she is residing (paras. 117-120).(4) A seasonal worker should be entitled to benefit in the off-season only if he can prove to the satisfaction of the Court of Referees (a) that he has in the past worked in the off-season for a reasonable time in some insurable occupation, and(b) that, having regard to the industrial circumstances of the district, he can reasonably expect to obtain insur-able work in the off-season in the district in which he is residing (paras. 122-125).VII.-GENERAL.130. In this Report we have dealt mainly with the finances of the Scheme. We have taken this course because this aspect of the problem has been most urgently brought to our attention. But we should wish to add that the finance of the Scheme is not more important or more difficult than other questions which arise in connection with it. The social and economic effects of the Scheme as a whole deserve most careful consideration and we shall have something to say on these matters in our final Report. Nevertheless in closing this part of our enquiry, we desire to say that in spite of difficulties and in spite of the criticism that may fairly be made
against the present position and against some of the features of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, it has prevented serious distress in a period of unprecedented unemployment. To put the Scheme on right lines for the future is worth some effort and sacrifice. We are convinced that the principle of insurance against industrial unemployment has an important part to play in the adaptation of our industrial structure to changing needs.All which we humbly submit foe Your Majesty&apos;s G-eaciotjs consideration.(Signed)   Holman Gregory,(Chairman).

MINORITY REPORT.May it please Youe Majesty,1. We are unable to agree with the Majority of the Commis-sion in the interim recommendations which they make in the direc-tion of placing the Unemployment Fund on a self-supporting basis, and for reducing the cost to the Exchequer of Transitional Benefit. We beg, therefore, to present our views in a separate Report.General.2. We regret that it was considered necessary for the Commis-sion to present an interim Eeport on these lines at this stage. The Commission has under consideration proposals which involve the whole scope of an Unemployment Insurance Scheme. There has not yet been time to hear and consider the many intereats concerned, or to review the evidence that has already been received. All proposals, therefore, which involve large issues of policy, are properly reserved for the final Eeport. For this reason, if for no other, we think it undesirable that, at this time, interim recom-mendations should be made which seriously disturb the existing basis of the Unemployment Fund. But we have another reason of greater importance; we are convinced that any attempt to balance the Fund under existing circumstances can only result in worsening the condition of the unemployed. We, therefore, recommend that (with the exception of some alterations referred to later under the heading of &quot; Anomalies &quot;) no changes be made in the existing Unemployment Insurance Scheme until the Corn-mission has presented its final Eeport, and we confine ourselves in this interim Eeport to those questions on which recommendations are made by the majority.3. Our colleagues have given a detailed account of the past and present finances of the Scheme, and it is not necessary for us to go over the same ground again. We may recall the fact that the Fund has been in debt since unemployment became acute in 1921. The cost of unemployment was beyond what the scheme could bear, and money had to be found to meet it. We regret that re-course was had to borrowing and that that method of balancing the Fund has continued till to-day. The hope that- trade would improve, and that it would be possible to repay the sums borrowed, was never justified by the event. Unemployment, persistent and prolonged, still continues. Its cost, in so far as it is not met by contributions to the Fund, should be met by general taxation. The nation, in this matter of the daily or weekly maintenance of those who have no earnings, should pay its way. At the same time, we realise that it is a vital concern of the taxpayer that the money raised should be spent for the purpose intended by Parlia-ment in framing the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and for none
other. We have reason to believe that to an overwhelming extent this is the case to-day. In so far as money is being spent in ways that were not foreseen at the outset of the scheme, we think that certain of the proposals for dealing with existing anomalies which are made in the Majority Report and to which we shall refer later, go as far (to meet the difficulty as is possible for a temporary expedient.4. The finance of the Scheme has become disorganised, and the insurance principle of relating benefits to contributions has broken down. But a more important consideration from the standpoint of the national welfare is that the Scheme was expanded from time to time to meet the needs of increasing numbers of unemployed, and that the alternative course of attempting to fit ithe unemployed into the strict limits of the original Scheme was avoided. Even with the expansion of the Scheme that did take place, there were at times instances in which the burdens that fell upon the Local Authorities in relieving those unemployed who were outside the scheme proved almost intolerable, but speaking generally, the Acts of Parliament expanding the Scheme have enabled it to cover the great bulk of able-bodied unemployment. It is difficult to see how, without these extensions of the Scheme, the nation could have met an unparalleled trade depression as well as it has done.5. It is obvious that with unemployment at the figure at which it stands to-day, the Unemployment Pund does not balance. The majority of the Commission have set themselves the task of achiev-ing solvency by various methods, including an increase in contri-butions and a decrease in benefits. We do not accept the position that the main object at the present time is a scheme under which income and expenditure can be made to balance. In our opinion the chief purpose to be kept in view is to maintain the unem-ployed on a level of subsistence at least no lower than that at which they are to-day. It is they who have already felt the force of economic depression with much greater severity than any other section of the community, and they Should be the last to be called upon to bear any further burden. Not only do we regard this as a matter of equity, but we also consider it an essential of national economy that nothing should be done which would tend in any degree to impair still further the physical strength and productive efficiency of those who, though unemployed to-day, may at any time be needed again to take their place as workers in the indus-trial field.6. The sum spent on the maintenance of the unemployed amounted during the year ended 31st March, 1931, to about  92J millions in benefit and about  2J millions in out-door relief. The average live register during the same period was 2,202,000 and the cost, though large, must therefore be looked at in relation to the
numbers of the unemployed. It must also be realised that this sum has to meet not only the needs of the unemployed persons themselves, but also of all those dependent on them. It is clear that an enormous gap, indicating privation of every kind, exists between the benefit that has been received and the wages that would have been earned had the unemployed been in work.7. But even if it were desirable or necessary that sacrifices should be called for in the interests of solvency, and if an equili-opprobrium in the finances of the Fund could be for the time achieved, there can be no guarantee whatever that such an equilibrium could be maintained. For just as there has been no sure financial basis for the Scheme in the past because it has proved entirely impossible for its framers to forecast correctly from time to time the amount of unemployment for which they ought to provide, so we maintain there is no sure financial basis to-day. It is possible to assume a level of unemployment based on a Live Register of 2,500,000, but at any time strikes, lock-outs or even large schemes of re-organisation at home, or boycotts, upheavals, or reversals of national policy abroad, may cause the figures to soar, and the relation between contributions and benefits may again be completely upset. No limitation of the number of weeks for which benefit can be drawn will meet this difficulty. It is as impossible to say how many persons will be unemployed for 26 weeks during next year or the year after as it is to say how many will be unem-ployed for the whole time. As long as an Insurance Scheme exists at all, the only financial basis for it (unless it is to fail completely in its task of providing for the unemployed) is to fix such contri-butions from the employers and the workers as can reasonably be borne, and for the residue required to be paid by the State.We now proceed to examine the proposals of the Majority for balancing the income and expenditure of the Unemployment Fund.Reduction op the period of Benefit.8. With regard to the proposal for limiting the period for which benefit can be drawn under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme as at present constituted, the effect would be to transfer to transi-tional benefit no less a number than about 250,000 making a total in the transitional class of 850,000 or about 34 per cent, of the total unemployed.9. Such a proposal cannot in the existing circumstances be justi-fied : in fact it appears to us to be singularly inappropriate. A feature of present day unemployment is the length of the periods during which individuals are out of work. In industrial areas heavily hit by trade depression, where persons in large numbers are unemployed for long periods, the effect will be to place in the transitional class persons who before the slump in trade had excel-lent industrial records.   They would then have to fulfil not oDly
the conditions applicable to Transitional Benefit to-day, but (if the proposals of the Majority were carried into effect) other new con-ditions also. These would place them at a still further dis-advantage as compared with the recipients of ordinary benefit.10. That provision must be made for the unemployed, whether within or without the Insurance Scheme, is universally recognised. The financial effect of the above proposal will be merely to transfer the cost of benefit from one account to another. Our view is that there is nothing to be gained by taking this step in advance of our final recommendations.Contribution s.11. We are unable to agree that the employers&apos; and the workers&apos;contribution should be increased..... ....12. As pointed out in paragraph 61 of the Majority Report, in 1925 when the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos;, and Old Age Contributory Pen-sions Scheme was launched, the contributions to the Unemploy-ment Fund were reduced. This was in fact a recognition of the very heavy burden of the cost of social insurance on industry and the worker. What was appropriate at that time applies with much greater force to-day.13. As regards the employees contribution, we consider it in every way undesirable that, when additional money is required to finance the Fund, any further burden should be placed upon industry alone, rather than upon the general taxpayer. Such a charge, instead of being shared among incomes, many of which are derived from a much steadier source than industry provides to-day, falls directly upon the costs of production at the very outset before any profits can be made, and it can only have the effect of further hampering industry in its efforts to bring down these costs to the lowest practicable level.14. An increase in the rate of the worker&apos;s contributions of 2d. a week would make the total contribution of the adult male 9d. a week or 39s. per annum. In addition to this there is the payment he already makes in respect of Health Insurance and the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos;, and .01d Age Contributory Pensions iScheme, which amounts to another 9d. a week or a further sum of 39s. per year. In the case of the low paid worker, this is equivalent to two weeks&apos; wages in the year. It should also be borne in mind that wages have recently been falling and the worker is less able to pay increased contributions at the present time.Rates of Benefit.15. We consider any proposal for the reduction of benefits at the present time as definitely harmful. It should be remembered that the rates of benefit for young persons and for the adult dependant
were increased as recently as March, 1930, and there is no justifica-tion for reducing them now.16. The intention of the original Act of 1911 was to enable the unemployed to tide over short spells of unemployment, and at that time the possibility of prolonged unemployment such as we are ex-periencing to-day was certainly not in the minds of those who framed that measure. Even assuming the&apos; conception of an Un-employment Insurance Scheme, as embodied in the 1911 Act, we do not admit that the present scale of benefit is more than sufficient for a short spell. But when considered in conjunction with &quot;the impoverishment of the unemployed which must follow long spells of unemployment, it falls much below the sum that is required to make adequate provision in order to ensure that a decent standard of physical and mental capacity is maintained.17. So long as the rate of unemployment benefit is less than a reasonable subsistence level, any variation in the rate of benefit to take account of variations of the cost of living is irrelevant. In any event, if a comparison is to be made between the cost of living at present and at any other period, it should obviously be March, 1930, when, as we have already stated, the benefits for young per-sons and adult dependants were increased. If this date is taken it will be discovered that the effect of a reduction of 3s. for the man and wife (from 26s. to 23s. as proposed by the Majority) would be to place them in a worse position than they were then. We view with alarm any reduction of benefit; it can only result in further privation. The effect of this will be seen in a substantial addition to the cost of other social services.Transitional Benefit.18. We agree with the Majority in their recommendation that the transitional period, which begins to expire in October, 1931, should be extended, but we are not in favour of the new conditions for the receipt of benefit which they propose should apply to this class of claimants. We are at a loss to understand why in an Interim Report proposals should be put forward, even as a tem-porary measure, which will have the effect of creating greater diffi-culties for those who, owing to prolonged unemployment and the poverty associated with it, are entitled to more rather than less consideration at the hands of the rest of the community. We deal with the three proposed new conditions in the following paragraphs.Thirty contributions in the past six years.19 The recommendation of the Majority Report is to require a claimant for transitional benefit to show that he has paid eight con-triButions in two years or 30 contributions in the last six years, instead of the existing conditions of eight contributions in two years or 30 contributions at any time.   We think that this proposal will
not only place those in receipt of transitional benefit in a worse position, but will also make it more difficult to deal with the whole subject at a later stage. In our view the conditions under which transitional benefit can be obtained are sufficiently strict. The onus of proof is placed upon the claimant to show that &quot;he is normally employed in insurable employment and will normally seek to obtain his livelihood by means of insurable employment.&quot; During the six months ended 31st March, 1931, no less than 84,543 persons failed to satisfy this condition, as compared with a total of 233,092 disallowances on all grounds. To add to this test a further restriction based on contributions paid in the last six years would certainly exclude a number of those who are now able to satisfy the Court of Referees that they fulfil this condition. It is estimated that the effect of this further restriction would mean the immediate disallowance of 40,000 persons who in the main will be resident in those areas where employment has been, in the circumstances of the last six years, most difficult to obtain. There is no doubt that many of them would be obliged to apply immediately for public assistance.20. It is estimated that the saving on transitional benefit at present rates, by this exclusion, in a full year would be  3,300,000. This sum borne by the nation as a whole cannot be regarded as a burden in the same sense as all or even a fair proportion of it would be to those local authorities who could least afford it, and by whom it would have to be borne. On these grounds we cannot agree with this recommendation, the effect of which will be to transfer part of the cost of relieving unemployment from the Exchequer to the local rates and we are of the opinion that the conditions of transitional benefit should remain as at present, pending our final report.Limitation of benefit to certain classes.21. A second proposal is that certain classes of claimant for transitional benefit should be required to attend before Local Assessors who would decide whether benefit was to be paid, and, if so, whether in full or in part. The persons included in the three classes are : (1) Single persons who are residing with parents or relations to whom, having regard to all the circumstances, they could reasonably look for support during unemployment.(2) Married women living with their husbands who are in employment and whose incomings are sufficient to justify the withholding of transitional benefit from the wife. A similar Limitation should also be applied to married men whose wives are in employment.(3) Persons who are in receipt of Workmen&apos;s Compensation, Service pensions (other than for War Disability), and other fixed income other than income from savings.
We have strong objections on many grounds to this proposal. Apart from questions of principle, we think there are many diffi-culties which would make any course such as is here proposed undesirable in practice.22. It is estimated that the number of persons who would be transferred to transitional benefit if ordinary benefit were restricted to 26 weeks in the year would be 250,000, making a total of 850,000&apos;. It may be presumed, therefore, that the numbers that would have to attend before the Local Assessors would be&apos;high. The question whether such bodies are suitable to be entrusted with these large powers of making decisions of vital importance to claimants for benefit is one which ought in our opinion to receive much greater consideration. This proposal bears a resemblance to the arrange-ments which were in operation between April, 1925, and April, 1928, when Extended Benefit was granted to certain classes (in-cluding (1) and (2) above but not (3) ), only at the discretion of the Minister, and the applications were considered by Rota Committees at the local Employment Exchanges. It was found that, between these dates, the total number of per-sons in classes (1) and (2) above who were disallowed benefit, only amounted to 3.4 per cent, of all the applications for extended benefit considered by the Rota Committees. It is true that there is an important difference in the new proposal from the old, in that under the old procedure benefit could only be allowed or dis-allowed, whereas in the new it could when thought advisable, be paid at a reduced rate. But even with this difference it seems as if the financial result would scarcely be such as to justify the setting up of new procedure with all the detailed organisation that would be entailed.23. But though the number disallowed might be small in com-parison with the work that would be involved, it would be large enough to inflict hardship upon many individuals and to lower the standard of life in many households. It is on the single men and women that (judging from previous experience) the disallowance would chiefly fall, as the number in this class dis-allowed between the dates given above was nearly three times as many as the number of married persons. These young people, if without earnings, should be enabled to pay their way without burdening their relatives with their support, or resorting to other less desirable methods of gaining money, or leaving home in order thus to qualify themselves for benefit.24. Our final objection to this proposal is that it is unsuited to an interim Report. Seeing that large changes will shortly be under consideration, it cannot be wise to alter the existing proce-dure by the introduction of an&apos; investigation into circumstances which would be in itself highly contentious, as well as difficult to
work out in practical administration, and requiring the establish -ment of new machinery. We urge that any small financial savings that might be effected would be of little value as compared to the anxiety caused to claimants for transitional benefit and the possible prejudice to later and permanent proposals.Refusal of work condition.25. A third recommendation is made with regard to claimants for transitional benefit. The Majority Report states that the pro-vision laid down in the Act of 1927 in connection with the offer of suitable employment is, as at present interpreted, not. suffi-ciently effective in the case of applicants for transitional benefit. It is therefore recommended that a former condition which operated before the 1927 Act in the case of applicants for extended benefit should be re-introduced. It appears that the Act of 1927 was intended to provide proper safeguards, applicable to all claimants alike, against the refusal of suitable employment. We consider that if the interpretation of the Act is at variance with that intention, an amendment should be considered. In our view that would be a better method of dealing with the difficulty than by any further discrimination between the recipients of transitional and ordinary benefit.Anomalies.Intermittent and Seasonal Workers.26. We are in agreement with our colleagues in the proposals for dealing with intermittent workers and seasonal workers.Casual Workers and Short-time Workers.27. The formula proposed in the Majority Report under this heading appears to us to make an effective contribution towards the solution of the particular difficulties associated with these classes of workers. It will reduce the amount of benefit in cases where exceptionally high earnings are received for a short spell of work, without affecting the position of the low paid worker. It intro-duces, however, an entirely new principle and it could not be brought into operation without considerable readjustment of the existing arrangements. We do not think, therefore, that it is suitable for inclusion among recommendations intended to cover only a temporary period. Moreover, the proposal would affect large numbers of those employed in the Dock Industry, and in all the circumstances our view is that it would be inadvisable to deal with the problem of casual and short-time workers until we have had an opportunity of studying the Report of the Committee on Port Labour, under the Chairmanship of the Right Hon. Sir Donald Maclean, M.P., and of hearing further evidence.
4Married Women.28. On the subject of the position of married women under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, we append two notes setting out our respective views.Other Anomalies.29. The anomalies which the Commission has been able to investigate, in the time at its disposal, have mainly been those in which benefit is being paid in circumstances which it is suggested the scheme was not intended to cover. But on the other hand, evidence has also been placed before the Commission showing that there are many instances in which the conditions for the receipt of benefit operate to exclude persons who should be entitled to benefit under a reasonable scheme. It is impossible for the Commission to examine cases of this latter kind at the present time and.to suggest remedies, but it is hoped that close consideration will be given to them and that suitable recommendations may be made in the final report.All which, with our humble duty, we submit for Your Majesty&apos;s Gracious Consideration.(Signed)   W. Asbur.y.Clara D. Baceham.1st June, 1931.NOTE NO. I TO THE MINORITY REPORT.Note by Councillor W. Asbury.With regard to the position of married women under the Unem-ployment Insurance Acts, I am in agreement with the views and recommendations contained in the Majority Beport.(Signed)   W. Asbury.NOTE NO. II TO THE MINORITY REPORT.Note by Mrs. CD. Backham.1. I am unable to agree with the Majority of the Commission in the recommendations which they make on the subject of married women claimants to benefit, and I therefore beg leave to present my views in a separate memorandum.2. It must be noted at the outset that, in proposing special con-ditions for benefit to apply to married women only, a serious departure is being made from the principles of the Unemployment Insurance Acts. There has never since 1911 been any discrimina-tion against any claimant for benefit on account of sex or marriage.
Such a departure cannot be justified on the grounds that the large majority of women cease after marriage to earn their living in insurable employment. There is a minority who remain in the industrial field and who are entitled to the benefits for which they have contributed so long as they fulfil the conditions imposed on other insured persons. It may be noted that in so far as women leave industry on marriage, the Fund must greatly benefit : such women contribute to the Fund during their period of least unem-ployment and then make no further claims upon it in later years.3. It is true that a large number of married women are claiming benefit to-day, but the figures do not support the suggestion that married women are to any extent misusing the Fund. The propor-tion of married women among women claimants increased from 26.1 per cent, in April, 1927, to 43.7 per cent, in February, 1930, but during these years there was a heavy increase in unemployment in the textile areas and in the potteries where large numbers of married women are employed : and it must also be noted that during the whole of this time the &quot; Genuinely Seeking Work &quot; condition was in operation. Since this clause was dropped in March, 1930, the increase has been only from 43.7 per cent, to 50 per cent, in October, 1930, and since that date there has been a fall to 47 per cent, in February, 1931. It must be remembered that there is always a tendency on the part of employers, when reductions in staff have to be made, to select the married women as in their opinion the least likely to suffer as a result of dismissal. This tendency operates at a time when many married women, owing to the unemployment, short time, or falling wages of their husbands, are being forced back into industry. These factors help to explain the la,rge number of married women claiming benefit at this time.4. The figures given above cover both ordinary and transitional benefit. A married woman claimant for transitional benefit in order to satisfy transitional condition (b) is required to prove to the Court of Referees that she has been making efforts to obtain work. Her financial circumstances can also be taken into consideration as giving an indication of her intention to obtain her livelihood by means of insurable employment. Bearing this in mind, it is noteworthy that the proportion of married women drawing transitional benefit as compared with those drawing ordinary benefit is increasing, and that to a greater degree than is the case with single women. The proportions in the case of married women in July, 1930, were 18.5 on transitional benefit and 81.5 on ordinary benefit, while for single women they were 7.4 and 92.6. By February, 1931, the figures were for married women 23.3 and 76.7 ; for single women 9.7 and 90.3. It is obvious that larger proportions of married women are suffering from prolonged unemployment, but it is equally clear that the proportion which passes the severer test placed upon claimants for transitional benefit is also increasing.
5. The married women claiming ordinary benefit are of course a much larger problem. The majority of the Commission propose two new conditions, the first being that a married woman should not be entitled to benefit unless she has satisfied the statutory authorities &quot; that she has not abandoned insurable employment.&quot; It might be very difficult for a married woman who had been unable to obtain employment since her marriage to satisfy this condition, and yet she might be fully entitled to benefit on grounds of equity. Such would be the position of a woman discharged on marriage and anxious to obtain other work and unable to do so, or of a woman who may have left wage earning for a short period after marriage but has been for economic reasons compelled to return to it. In each case the woman would be a genuine worker and qualified for benefit by her contributions, and yet, as has been said, she might be hard put to it to prove that she had not abandoned insurable employment. The experience of the National Health Insurance Fund in connection with married women claimants goes to show the impossibility of judging a married woman &apos;s intention to work by her ability to obtain work, especially in a time of depression such as the present.6. The second proposed condition is that a married woman must show that &quot; having regard to her industrial experience and to the industrial circumstances of the district, she can reasonably expect to obtain insurable employment in the district in which she is residing.&quot; The idea presumably is that if a woman can show by the efforts she is making that she has not abandoned insurable occupation, she is still not to be entitled to benefit unless there is a reasonable expectation that those efforts will be crowned with success. Much is said in this connection about firms refusing to employ married women, but there is no evidence as to how wide-spread this custom is, or whether it is increasing, or (what is more important) how far it is merely a feature of the present depres-sion. Firms that can only employ a small proportion of those who apply to them for work find it convenient to engage single women only, and so to simplify the situation to some extent. There is no doubt that if employment increased there would be much less dis-crimination between married and single women, and employers would be more interested in securing those workers who would best meet their needs, without regard to their status.7. It is necessary however to look more closely at the large num-bers of married women who are drawing ordinary benefit, and to consider if there are any steps which should be taken to prevent any possible abuse of the Fund. In the first place it must be noted that the proposals of the Commission regarding intermittent and seasonal workers, if carried into effect, would remove from the Fund some married women among the claimants belonging to those two classes. If expectant mothers were in all cases entitled to Sickness Benefit during the last weeks of pregnancy, this would also relieve the
Fund of a certain number of married women who claim benefit while doubtfully capable of work.8. A claimant for ordinary benefit must be available for work. The word &quot; available &quot; has caused some difficulty in the case of married women as they may have domestic duties to perform at home, and the question arises as to whether these interfere with their avail-ability for work. Married women who claim benefit should be genuinely available for an ordinary industrial occupation, and generally speaking they should not be treated differently from other claimants in the degree of availability which is required of them.9. A claimant can be disallowed benefit for six weeks for refusing suitable employment. This disallowance is much more frequent in the case of women than of men, on account of the unsatisfied demand for women in domestic service and the unpopularity of that calling. Resident domestic service is not of course suitable employ-ment for married women, but numbers of them are disallowed bene-fit for refusing daily domestic service. It must be remembered that, for various reasons whicii need not be discussed here, the Women&apos;s Departments of Exchanges have a very much larger num-ber of vacancies notified to them in proportion to the number of claimants than have the men&apos;s, and this naturally means that their opportunities of submitting candidates for vacancies are more numerous also. Of course, there are districts in which the only industries have been so severely hit by the present depression that there is very little work available for women at all. It is difficult to know in such places what reason-able expectation any claimant of either sex has of getting work, and there is no reason why married women should be specially penalised for this state of things.10. It is clear that, if we are to rely upon a fair and reasonable interpretation of the statutory conditions to exclude from benefit married women who are not really entitled to it, much depends on the regular review of claims and interviewing of claimants. The Moms Committee laid stress on the importance of interviews be-tween claimants and representatives of the statutory authorities as the most convenient way of ascertaining whether a claimant was eligible for benefit, and that in particular the question of what work outside his usual occupation was suitable for him should be a matter for frank and full discussion. It is on the lines of such individual effort combined with careful and equitable use of existing machinery that the position must be faced.11. The problem under discussion is not a new one ; it was placed before the Blanesburgh Committee with many of the same argu-ments as it has been placed before us. The Committee did not accept the suggestions made to them that married women should be treated as a special class to whom sipecial conditions should be applied.   They stated that, &quot; the evidence did not indicate that the
special problems of married women when they are included within the scheme are incapable of administrative solution.&quot; Nothing that has since occurred appears in my view to justify any departure from this principle.12. Married women differ completely one from another, not only in their domestic circumstances, but also in their value in the labour market, and in their whole outlook upon industry; any attempt to treat them as a class, to be governed by uniform rules applicable to no other section of insured persons, could only result in friction and in hardship.(Signed)   Clara D.
