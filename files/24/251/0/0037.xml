Copy No.CP. 262 (34).CABINET.OIL POSITION IN JAPAN AND MANCHURIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AN urgent question has arisen in connexion with the control of the oil industry in Japan and Manchuria on which I must ask for a decision from the Cabinet. The Japanese Government, so far as Japan is concerned, have passed a law having as its main objects the accumulation in the interests of the Japanese Government, but at the expense of the oil companies, of &apos;large&apos;vreserves of oil, obviously to meet a war emergency, and the encouragement of the refining of oil in Japan. It gives the Japanese Government extensive powers of control over the oil industry, enables them to fix sale prices, to determine the quotas of oil imports allotted annually to any given company, to force oil companies to expand their storage plant in case of necessity and to set up refineries in Japan. At the same time, officials of oil companies who fail to comply with the Governments instructions may be dismissed. The principal British oil interest involved, the Asiatic Petroleum Company (a Shell subsidiary), if it complied with the law would have to incur an expenditure of some  2,500,000 on the erection of additional storage tanks and accessory plant and on the increase of current oil stocks to about three times their present volume. At the same time, the company receives no security under the law that they wall ever recoup themselves for this large expenditure; &apos; indeed, the Japanese Government, by taking the powers allowed them by the law of arbitrarily fixing sale prices and limiting the quota of trade annually allotted to the company, may actually prevent them recouping themselves. The company may eventually find it impossible to continue business in Japan; this new capital expenditure, together with that previously incurred, would in this case become a dead loss.A similar scheme in Germany of largely increased storage at the oil companies&apos; expense was recently met by the oil companies by means of the threat of restricting supplies of oil, and the British companies are now considering the desirability, if no satisfaction is obtained, of threatening to withhold supplies as a means of pressure on Japan, should it appear necessary to do so. In this event, the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the United States Govern-ment will be essential. The threat of withholding supplies will not be effective (and if it is not effective, it had better not be used) unless the American and the Dutch East Indies Oil Companies join with the backing of their own Governments, and of this the British oil companies will have to assure themselves.. They are already in active consultation, and the American companies are&apos; understood to view the situation as seriously as the British companies do.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo is in favour of this policy, for which there are strong arguments. If Japan gets her way, she will build up large stocks at others&apos; expense, and will have scored a notable victory which will enhance her prestige, and which will encourage other countries to attempt similar action. The Chinese will not fail to draw the moral from such a victory, and our prestige and position in the Far East may suffer serious damage.Considerations that have been put forward against the proposal are the dangers which may be apprehended if an example is set of the use with76*62   [10790]
Government countenance of &quot;a powerful economic weapon against Japan, more particularly while our defensive position in the Far East is still in such a precarious condition. It has also been suggested that Japan, feeling that she is in danger of being deprived of an essential raw material, might reply with some violent action, such as a coup against the East Indies, in order to secure her own sources of supply. The result might well be a dangerous situation, in which we could scarcely fail to become involved. The latter fear is not shared by the Foreign Office, which would be prepared to give the oil companies a free hand, and to inform the United States Government with a view to their taking a similar line.I would add that a somewhat similar and perhaps even more objectionable situation has arisen in Manchuria, where the institution of a Government monopoly of sales of oil is imminent, together with the creation of a Manchurian oil company, 80 per cent, of whose capital will be Japanese, including 40 per cent, from the South Manchurian Railway Company, a semi-Governmental organisa-tion, the policy of which is controlled by the Japanese Government. In this case, the infringement of the Open Door principle and of various treaty provisions forbidding monopolies in China is involved, and, if the project is carried through, the way will be open to further monopolies already contemplated in Manchuria. The Chinese will, in all probability, attempt to follow suit with monopolies of various kinds in their own territory, and our means of resistance may be found inadequate.J. S.November 20, 1934.
