(THIOSSHIM IS ,THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .CP. 290(34). Copy No.   &amp;jCABINET.Preliminary appreciation of the reception in India of the Report of the Joint Select Committee.Jvfemorandum by the Secretary .of... State for India.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a telegram which I have recently received from the Government of India containing a preliminary appreciation of the reception in India of the Report of the Joint Select Committee.S o H.6th December 1934.Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India, dated 2nd December, 1934.All Local Governments point out that it is too early to give considered views as to the practical attitude that the main parties and committees will adopt as distinct from the preliminary attacks which were only to be expected.   This preliminary appreciation is based largely on newspaper opinion which is generally, as we had expected, distinctly hostile, and it remains to be seen how far newspapers reflect the depth of public feeling or are capable of manufacturing it.   We do not attempt to deal in this telegram with detailed points of attack and criticism, but to reproduce opinions of the Local Governments bearing on the general question whether there will be a substantial body of public opinion prepared to work the Constitution.Madras.
3782.Madras.     In moderate opinion there is an under-current of relief that the Report proposes no radical change in regard to law and order. The general feeling is that the new Constitution will be accepted for what it is worth and worked so as to obtain a further advance in self-government.   The threat of non-cooperation by a small proportion of extremists is not to be taken seriously, but clearly the Report has not satisfied even moderate public opinion.Bombay.   Amongst individual moderatess Sir G-hulam Husain Hid.ayatullahs though disappointed, has advised acceptance as an instalment.   Paranjpye denounces it as reactionary and thinks India will be better off if it remained under the old Constitution for some time.   Mrs. Naidu, Jamnadas Mchta and Nariman have all urged rejection.Bengal.     Despite disappointment at certain features, seven prominent Muslims have issued a manifesto declaring the intention of Muslims to ir!ork the Reforms.   Bengal Depressed Classes Association considers advance real and a generous gesture from British statesmen.   British India Association welcomes the Constitution proposed in the Report as a definite advance to1, ards responsible government. European opinion appears generally satisfied with the Law and Order proposals.United Provinces.   There is general satisfaction among Muslims that the Communal Award is accepted, but otherwise Muslim opinion is divided between general disapproval and luke-warm cooperation. The landlords&apos; opinion so far expressed is in favour of working the Constitution, though not altogether satisfied with special representation proposals. The general public in the districts are apathetic and show no indication of any desire to non-cooperate.   No protest meetings have been arranged.   On the whole, it seems probable that theIndependents,
2773.Independents, Liberals, Mahasabhaites, Muslims, Chambers of Commerce, Zamindars and Talukdars will work the Constitution in spite of inevitable initial criticism, but opinion has not yet cyrstallised and only a very tentative forecast is possible. Congress, though regarding the Report as in the same category of unacceptability as the White Paper, are not likely actively to non-cooperate, but this must be subject to the decision of the Parliamentary Board.Pun,iab.     The Punjab Government analyses newspaper opinion.   Papers unite in professing disappointment, but the Muslim press strongly approve the maintenance of the Cormiunal Award.   No paper has yet suggested that the Constitution should net be worked.   On the contrary a statement by the leader of the Unionist Party that the Punjab will work the Reforms has been roil advertised.Bihar.     A considerable body of moderate opinion is apparently ready to work the proposed Constitution, though regarding the Report as disappointing and more reactionary than the White Paper, but the great majority are waiting for a lead from Congress.   Euhammadans generally are satisfied with the retention of the Communal Award and the leading ruham.iaclans support the Report.    In Orissa satisfaction over the extension of the boundaries is the predominant reaction.North-West Frontier Province.     The general attitude of those interested in politics is that, though Ministers&apos; powers will be restricted more than is necessary, efforts must be made to work Constitution based on the Report. There is reason to believe that the genuine opinion of the majority-is more favourable than they like to express.   Opinion appears more in favour of indirect election than before.Assam.   It is considered that opinions so far givenare
3784.are based more on r general and abstract distrust of a scheme of Reforms evolved in England than on considered criticisms of the Report.Burma.   The Indian press adopts the Congress attitude and is very hostile- to the recommendations affecting the position of Indians in Burma. The general Indian attitude will probably accord closely to press utterances and this atmosphere of hostility may have an unfortunate effect in impedingtra.de negotiations, if it spreads to India. There are no indications that separationists will reject proposals or adopt an attitude of non-cooperation. They will probably work the Constitution under protest. Anti-scparationists will decide their attitude at a Conference on the 8th December and may follow Congress attitude.    It is, however, impossible yet to estimate the strength of the extremist anti-separationist elements or the length to which they will go in resistance to the constitutional scheme.General.   Though any appreciation must at this stage be very tentative, the opinions quoted above from Local Governments go to show that Muslim opinion is in favour of working the Constitution and is pleased at the retention of the Communal Award.   Moderate opinion will probably follow theline recently taken by Sapru and Jayakar who, while advocating that there should be a concerted demand for alterations in the desired direction, are. clear that &quot; a negative and destructive policy may seriously affect our future for a long time as, indeed, we are convinced it has affected several decisions of the Committee.;!   Mich, however, depends on the attitude adopted by the Congress Parliamentary Board at their meeting, this week, but the Congress leaders, in particular Babu Rajendra Prasacl, appear to recognise that, under present conditions, they can do little more than register a protest and that, though a concerted
concerted wordy protest may be possible, concerted action appears impossible. The difficulty of putting forward as an alternative to the Resort a Constitution agreed upon by all parties5 including Congress, is also recognised by them.    In fact, unless Congress are in a position to start yet another civil disobedience movement the term &quot;rejection&quot; means little more than strong protest.
