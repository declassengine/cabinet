.the DOOUMKNT 18 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC. W^TESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)EGRET. COPY HO. /j- d.P.  253 (34).- CABINET,COMMITTEE ON CRUISER ALLOCATION.., REPORT.1. At their Meeting on Wednesday, November 5th, 1934,(Cabinet 39 (34) Conclusion 12), the Cabinet agreed:&quot;That a Committee composed as follows:The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, The First Lord of the Admiralty, andThe Minister of Labour,should carefully consider all the relevant facts including the state of unemployment and the amount and value of Government and private orders on the Clyde, Mersey and Tyne respectively,  and recommend to the Cabinet at their next Meeting regarding the allocation of the two Cruisers to be built in private -yards&quot;.2.          The four lowest tenders for the two &quot;M&quot; Class cruisers of the 1934 programme are :-Vickers-Armstrong  1,025,400 (Barrow)Scott&apos;s (Clyde (Greenock))  1,023,250Cammell Laird  1,043,000 (Birkenhead)Hawthorn Leslie  1,049,300 (Tyne (Hebburn))It will be seen that there is a difference of  22,900 betweenhighest and lowest of these tenders and that the second lowesttender (Scott&apos;o (Greenock))  is only  1,350 above the lowesttender (Vickers-Armstrong (Barrow)).3.In ordinary circumstances the Admiralty would have given
to each of the two lowest tenderers (Vickers-Armstrong of Barrow and Scott&apos;s of Greenock) a contract to &quot;build a Cruiser.    It would be contrary to the established practice of the Admiralty to give a firm an opportunity of revising a tender, and the Admiralty would be strongly opposed to doing so on the present occasion as they attach the greatest importance to the maintenance of the principle of competitive tenders.     Any departure from this principle would immediately become known among the shipbuilding firms, would cause great dissatisfaction, and there would be seri cus danger that firms might be encouraged to rely on political pressure rather than on submitting the lowest possible tender.4. The 1954 rates of unemployment in shipbuilding inthe districts of the four tenderers are as follows :-Tyneside 70.4Clydeside 59.3Me rs eys i de 47.1Barrow 2S.as in the case of shipbuilding,so for all industries together the  rate of unemployment on Tyneside is considerably heavier than in the other three areas.5. The percentages of unoccupied berths on 30th September,1934 in the four districts wereTyneside 83.5%Clydesi de 58. 6fbBarrow 61.5%Birke ahead 57.5;eProm the points of view of unemployment and unoccupiedberths, Tyneside and the Clyde have the strongest claims force ons i de rati on.6.   &apos;     The tender of vickers-Armstrong was submitted to the Admiralty on the basis that both the hull and the machinery for the Cruiser would be built at Barrow.      The firm have, how&quot;ever, the Walker Yard on the North Bank of the Tyne where
the hull could be built, leaving the machinery to be made at Barrow.7. At the request of the Committee, the Admiralty haveascertained from Vickers-Armstrong that the firm will be prepared to build the hull of the Cruiser in their Walker Yard on the Tyne without any alteration in the amount of their original tender of  1,026,400.8. In these circumstances the Committee recommend tothe Cabinet: -That the two &quot;M&quot; Class Cruisers of the 1934 programme should be allocated to the two 1owest tenderers, viz:One Cruiser to Vickers-Armstrong; the hull to be built in the firm&apos;s Walker Yard on Tyneside, and the machinery at Barrow:    andOne Cruiser to Scott&apos;s, to be built at Greenock on the Clyde.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeN.
