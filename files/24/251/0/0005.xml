(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.CP.   250(34). COPY NO.,C A B I N E T.DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE 1952. MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE.PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS.REPORT.In accordance with Cabinet 54(54), Conclusion 6, a Meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament was held on Tuesday, 25rd October, 1954, when a preliminary discussion took place to consider what action might be recommended if, as soon as Parliament meets, the question is raised as to whether or not it is proposed to set up an inquiry similar to the Senatorial Inquiry in U.S.A. into the circumstances of the trade in arms carried on by British firms.The Committee explored generally various methods by which the Government might most satisfactorily meet a considerable volume of public opinion which was genuinely exercised on the question of private manufacture of arms as a result of the American arms inquiry, without in any way endangering the private armament industry in this country which, it was generally accepted, was vital to the maintenance of our security.It was felt that, in its most important aspect, the question of the manufacture and trade in arme was one of international concern and that the general question of trade in and manufacture of armaments by private firms must be kept entirely distinct from the methods by which contracts were obtained from foreign countries by private firms themselves.-1-
It was suggested that an extremely good case could he made out for the Government,  not only to shew the effectiveness of the control which was exercised in the export of arms from this country hut also to bring out the vital importance of the private armaments industry to our security,  and  that if,  as was anticipated,  a debate took place in the House,    this would provide one method of instructing public opinion.    It was also felt that there would be every advantage in considering whether our existing methods of controlling the  export of arms might not be made the basis of a convention drafted by us and proposed at Geneva for adoption by other States,  and that it would be very valuable to be able to announce at the same time that the Government was taking action of this kind with a view to securing international agreement.It was agreed accordingly to set up an Interdepartmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, with instructions to prepare, for the consideration of the Committee,  a Draft convention dealing with the control and supervision of the trade in, and manufacture of,   arms such as we could put forward as a self-contained proposal for international adoption.    This Committee has further &quot;been instructed to report very urgently on this question in view of the fact that it is possible that the United States of America may contemplate taking the initiative in this matter.(Intld.) J.H.M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 23rd October,  1934.
