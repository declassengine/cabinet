THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1934.SECRET. Copy No. 37CP. 245 (34).CABINET.WEST INDIES-CLOSER UNION PROPOSALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE Cabinet will recollect the conclusions reached at the meeting held on the 19th July, 1933, when Cabinet Paper 171 (33), in regard to the recommenda-tions made in the Report of the Closer Union Commission, which visited the Leeward Islands, the Windward Islands and Trinidad, wras under consideration.2. After I had fully examined the Commissioners&apos; proposals, it was apparent that their acceptability, in so far as closer union between the Windward and the Leeward Islands was concerned, would largely depend on the prospect of securing economy in the cost of administration, and that, to determine this, the financial implications of their proposals would have to be fully worked out. This was done, and I then arranged for the proposals to be debated in the Island Legislatures, having made it clear that, so far as the constitutional changes suggested by the Commissioners were concerned, I could only accept their proposals as providing a simpler method of exercising the Governor&apos;s functions without derogating in any way from his existing powers.3. The financial implications of the Report, as placed before the Legis-Legislatures, indicated the probability of increased rather than diminished expenditure, if, with the adoption of the Commissioners&apos; recommendations for closer union, efficiency in administration was to be maintained; and the results of the debates showed that there was little enthusiasm for the Commissioners&apos; proposals as they stood. I have accordingly decided that it is not practicable at present to proceed with a scheme of closer union.4. I had, however, been impressed by the view which had been emphasised in the Report that the time had come when the inhabitants of these Islands should be given a greater say in the conduct of local affairs, and I have accordingly instructed the Acting Governors of the Windward and Leeward Islands in despatches, of which copies are appended, to arrange for a vote to be taken in the Island Legislatures on the following proposals, namely, that the official majority should be abolished; that only those officials whose presence is necessary for the conduct of business should sit as members of the Legislative Council; that an unofficial majority should be created with elected as well as nominated members, on the definite understanding that (in addition to his existing power of veto) the Governor would be empowered at any stage to carry any measure which he considered necessary in the interests of public order, public faith or other essentials of good government. In view of the existing Federation of the Leeward Islands and the provisions of the constitutional instruments, special [10739] b
steps would require to be taken to give effect to the above proposals in that Colony, and a separate communication was made to the Acting Governor on these matters after the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown had been ascertained on certain points. A copy of the despatch on this subject is appended. I am advised that these changes would not require legislation here.5. I am at present awaiting the outcome of the debates in the Island Legislatures; but, as a certain amount of publicity has already been given to the proposals in the West Indian Press, I have caused copies of the despatches to be placed in the Library of the House of Commons, and it is also proposed to make the despatches available to the Press representatives here next week.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, November 7, 1934.
lit)APPENDIX 1.The Secretary of State to. the Officers Administering the Governments of the (1) Windward Islands (Grenada) (General No. 149), (2) Leeward Islands (No. 394).Sir, Downing Street, September 21, 1934.I HAVE the honour to refer to [To 1 : your despatch No. 90 of the 30th April] [To 2 : Sir Reginald St. Johnston&apos;s despatch No. 213 of the 9th April] relative to the Report of the Closer Union Commission, and to inform you that I have now concluded my examination of the results of the voting in the Legislative Councils of the Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands on the proposal to adopt the recommendations contained in the Report.2. I have read with interest the debates which took place on this subject. I observe that considerable divergence of opinion exists on the desirability of adopting the Commission^ proposals as they stand, more particularly on the ground of the additional expense as indicated in the estimates which were placed before the Legislatures. I note that doubt was thrown on these estimates; but as you are aware, the financial implications of the Commission&apos;&apos;s proposals were carefully examined before you were instructed to place the financial statement before the Legislatures, and I am unable to accept the suggestion that the estimates then worked out are inflated or excessive. It was suggested by unofficial members in certain Legislatures that revised estimates should be prepared. I do not consider, however, that any substantial economy can be secured by a revision of the estimates without a danger of serious loss of efficiency in administration, and I doubt whether, in criticising the salaries proposed, members have fully appreciated the responsibilities which would devolve on the heads of combined services and on certain other officers. I should not be prepared to invite officers to undertake these responsibilities on the reduced salaries which have in certain cases been suggested. It was further proposed by the unofficial members in St. Lucia that the inauguration of combined services should be deferred until after a Governor for the new Colony had been appointed; but this is not a suggestion which I should be disposed to adopt, as I should regard the unification of the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands under a single Governor without the simultaneous initiation of combined services as wholly unsatisfactory, and as constituting union only in name without the germ of future federation.3. In all the circumstances, I have reached the conclusion that it is not practicable now to proceed with a scheme of closer union. It follows that the two groups of islands will remain separate as at present and that the existing federation of the Leeward Islands will remain unaltered. Pending a decision on this question, the Governorship of the Windward Islands has remained unfilled; I now propose to seek His Majesty&apos;s approval for the appointment of a Governor of the Windward Islands in succession to Sir Thomas Best.4. The Report of the Commissioners was not, however, confined to proposals directly connected with the creation of a new Colony in which would be combined the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands. Inter alia, they expressed the view that the exercise of the Governors&apos; powers in these Islands to enforce the passage of Legislation by the use of an official majority in the local Legislatures was unsatisfactory, and they recommended the substitution of an unofficial majority for the existing official bloc subject to certain safeguards. The Commissioners also recommended the introduction of the elective principle into the constitutions of Antigua. St. Kitts-Nevis and Montserrat; in the constitutions of Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Dominica this already exists. I have been impressed with the recommendations made by the Commissioners on these matters, and I feel that the time has now arrived when some further measure of constitutional progress consistent with the requirements of proper administration can usefully be considered. I have decided, therefore, that public opinion in the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands should be given the opportunity of expressing its views through the Legislative Councils as to the adoption of the particular recommendations in the Commission^ Report, to which reference is [10739] B 2
made at the commencement of this paragraph, with the object of granting some greater measure of control of local affairs to the unofficial element in the Legis-Legislatures of the Windward Islands and of the several Presidencies of the Leeward Islands, except in the case of the Virgin Islands, whose constitution will remain unaltered.5. At the same time, with the making of any such constitutional change, I agree with the Commission that it is essential in the interests of good government that the Governor should retain full overriding powers to enable him to legislate on any subject if he considers it necessary to do so, in addition to his existing power of veto, which would remain unaltered. In the case of [To 1 : St. Lucia which is] [To 2: certain of the Presidencies which are] in receipt of assistance from the Imperial Exchequer, the finances of [To 1 : the Island] [To 2: those Presidencies] must continue to be subject to ultimate control by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, with the result that whatever steps are taken in the direction referred to above, the detailed control at present exercised [To 1 : in St. Lucia] [To 2 : in those Presidencies] cannot be abrogated and must be fully safeguarded.6. I feel confident that with the goodwill and the co-operation of the unofficial members of the several Legislatures, it should not prove impracticable in the case of any of the Windward and Leeward Islands in which the substitution of an unofficial majority in the Legislature is adopted, for the government to be successfully carried on on that basis, even in cases in which the continuance of special measures of control by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury is still required owing to the exigencies of the financial situation.7. If unofficial opinion in the various Legislatures expresses itself in favour of the adoption of the Commission^ recommendations for the substitution of an unofficial majority for the official majority in the Legislative Councils, subject to overriding powers of the Governor as indicated above, and, where applicable, for the adoption of the elective principle, the necessary amendments in the Constitutions of the [To 1 : Islands would be effected by Order in Council] [To 2 : Presidencies would be effected by legislation passed by the General Legislative Council of the Leeward Islands and the Presidential Legislatures].8. I should regard a provision to the following effect as adequate to secure the necessary powers to the Governor to pass legislation, should occasion arise on which in the interests of good government such a course might be necessary : &quot; If the Governor shall consider that (a) it is necessary in the interest of public faith, or good government, including the responsibilities of the [To 1 : Island] [To 2 : Presidency] as a component part of the British Empire that any Bill, motion, resolution or vote proposed for decision in the Council; or (&amp;) it is desirable that any Bill, motion, resolution, or vote so proposed relating to the appointment, salary, or conditions of service of any public officer or officers, should have effect, then if the Council fail to pass any such Bill, motion, resolution or vote within such time as he may think reasonable and expedient, the Governor at any time within his discretion may, notwithstanding any provisions of [ ] or of any standing orders of the Council, declare that any such Bill, motion, resolution or vote shall have effect, and thereupon the same shall have effect as if it had been passed by the Council, and in the case of any such Bill the Governor may assent thereto in His Majesty&apos;s name and sign the same in token of such assent.&quot;In the case of St. Lucia or Presidencies of the Leeward Islands whose finances are subject to Treasury control, further provision would be required to cover action if the Governor considers it necessary to exercise these powers in order to secure (within the scope of the bill, motion, resolution or vote concerned) detailed control of the finances during such time as, by virtue of the receipt of financial assistance by the Island or Presidencies from His Majesty&apos;s Exchequer for the purpose of balancing the annual budget or otherwise, such control rests with His Majesty&apos;s Government.9. I have decided, therefore, that the local Legislatures in the Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands (other than in the Virgin Islands) should be invited to vote on the following proposal, viz. :   &quot; That the official majority
should be abolished; that only those officials whose presence is necessary for the conduct of business should sit as Members of the Legislative Council; that an unofficial majority should be created with elected as well as nominated members, on the definite understanding that (in addition to his existing power of veto) the Governor would be empowered at any stage to carry any measure which he considered necessary in the interests of public order, public faith, or other essentials of good government.&quot;10. I do not desire that the general issue should be complicated at the present time by consideration of the precise manner in which the unofficial majorities should be constituted, or of the basis of the franchise. These matters will form the subject of separate consideration in consultation with you when unofficial opinion on the principal issue, as set out in the motion, has been ascertained. I desire, however, that when communicating the outcome of the debate in the Legislatures, you should take the opportunity to furnish me with your views as to these subsidiary matters in respect of each of the [To 1 : Islands] [To 2 : Presidencies] concerned.I may say, however, that as at present advised, I should, in general, favour the creation of unofficial majorities (consisting of both elected and nominated unofficials) by the reduction where possible of the number of official members, if this can be achieved without detriment to the proper conduct of business in the Legislature.As regards the franchise, the proposal made by the Closer Union Commis-sioners that the existing franchise in Dominica should be generally adopted, would commend itself to me; but the question of adding a literacy test to the existing Dominica qualifications for electors should be considered. In view of the recommendation put forward on page 22 of the Commissioners&apos; Report. I should also wish to be informed whether local opinion would be in favour of extending to women the right to vote where such provision does not already exist.11. I should not regard it as essential that there should be uniformity throughout the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands in regard to the form of constitution for each Island or Presidency; it may be that some Legislatures will wish to adopt the motion set out above, while others will prefer not to do so, and in that event I see no reason, subject to any views which you may have on the matter, why the wishes of each should not be met. Similarly, it may be found desirable to vary the manner in which the unofficial majority is to be constituted to suit the requirements of different Islands or Presidencies, which desire this change to be made.12. You will have observed that the Commission make certain comments upon the composition of the Executive Councils (pages 12 to 14 of Report). It appears to me that the Commissioners have somewhat misunderstood the position by importing the conception of a majority vote. The functions of an Executive Council are solely advisory to the Governor, who is not obliged to accept the advice tendered, and no question of arranging for an unofficial majority arises.13. It seems clear that little, if any, additional expenditure would be involved by the adoption of the proposals covered by this motion; but it would be convenient if, when you reply to this despatch, you will give an estimate of any additional expenditure which you think may result.14. I should be glad if you would arrange for this despatch to be placed before the various Legislatures concerned and for the motion set out above to be made the subject of debate at an early date. I may add that, as in the case of the previous debates on the Report of the Closer Union Commission, official members of Legislative Councils should be free to take part in the debate and to express their own views, but should refrain from voting on the motion.15. A despatch in similar terms has been sent to the Officer Administering the Government of the [To 1 : Leeward Islands] [To 2 : Windward Islands].I have, &amp;c.P. CUNLIFF E-LISTER.
APPENDIX 2.The Secretary of State to the Officer Administering the Government of. theLeeward Islands.(No. 395.)Sir, Downing Street, September 21, 1934.I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 394 of the 21st September in which I have indicated the extent to which I consider that it may be practicable to implement the recommendations made in the report of the Closer Union Commission, and to inform you that I have had under consideration the steps which would be necessary to give effect to the proposals made in paragraph? of that despatch, if, in the light of voting in the local Legislatures in the Leeward Islands, it is decided to proceed with them.2. It has been necessary to consider in the first instance whether, if unofficial opinion in the Presidencies of the Leeward Islands were to express itself in favour of the adoption of these recommendations subject to the retention by the Governor of full overriding powers, it is possible without recourse to an Act of Parliament(1) to alter the constitution of the Legislative Councils of the Presidencies so as to provide for the unofficial majorities therein :(2) to provide for an overriding power in the Governor to legislate when necessary for the several Presidencies.3. As regards (1), I am advised that there seems little reason to doubt that it would be competent for the Legislative Councils of the Presidencies so to amend their constitution ordinances, or where, as in the case of St. Kitts-Nevis, power has been conferred by Ordinance No. 1 of 1900 on the General Legislative Council of the Leeward Islands, for the necessary action to be taken if the proviso to section 2 of that Ordinance is first repealed by the local Legislature.4. As regards (2) the following considerations arise : Each of the constitu-tion ordinances of the Presidencies purports in one form or another to confer on, or to reserve to, the Governor and the local Council power to make laws for the Presidency in question, but it would appear that, nevertheless, the governing provision in this matter must be section 11 of the Leeward Islands Act. A clause to the effect stated in paragraph 8 of the despatch referred to above, with the object of providing the Governor with the necessary overriding powers, could be inserted into the constitution ordinances of the various Presidencies by the local Councils, but it might perhaps be regarded as open to doubt whether such a clause would not be repugnant to section 11 of the Leeward Islands Act.5. It has therefore been necessary to consider whether the clause could be inserted in the Leeward Islands Act by means of a Bill reserved under section 27 of the Act. It is obvious that such a clause would &quot;alter &quot; substantially the provisions of the Leeward Islands Act so far as the power to legislate for the Presidencies is concerned, and, indeed, it might be argued that it would amount to the creation of an entirely new legislature.Once the constitution of the various Councils is altered so as to provide for unofficial majorities, the only power to recall the grant without the consent of the various Councils would be by the use of the Governors overriding power, and therefore it will be apparent that should the provision with regard to the Governor&apos;s overriding power be held at any time to be ultra vires of the local legislatures, or, if inserted in the Act, of section 27 thereof, a serious situation would arise.6. On (2) and the cognate questions which require consideration I am advised that (i) it is not competent for the Legislative Councils of the Presidencies by local ordinance to alter the constitution of the several Councils so as to insert the proposed clause unless and until section 11 of the Lee-ward Islands Act is amended; and that&apos; while the power of legislation
conferred upon the several Legislative Councils varies, in every case the provisions of section 11 of the Leeward Islands Act must be regarded as having an overriding effect whether they are expressly mentioned, as in the case of the Virgin Islands, or not: (ii) that it is competent for the General Legislative Council by an ordinance reserved under section 27 of the Leeward Islands Act, to alter that Act by the insertion of a clause on the lines set out in paragraph 8 of my despatch under reference, so as to apply to the respective Legis-lative Councils of the Presidencies : (iii) that it is desirable that a similar provision should also be inserted in the constitution ordinances of Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis, Dominica and Montserrat, and that the proper procedure would be to make the alterations in the Presidency constitutions by local ordinances, amending section 11 of the Leeward Islands Act so as to ensure that these alterations will not be, as they are at present, repugnant to its terms.7. If, therefore, it is eventually decided to amend the constitutions of the Presidencies concerned with the objects contemplated, it will be necessary (a) for the Federal Legislature to enact legislation of the nature and withthe object referred to in paragraph 6 under (ii), subject to the enact-ment by a Presidential Legislature of repealing legislation where necessary, as in the case of St. Kitts-Nevis, with the object indicated at the conclusion of paragraph 3 :(b) for   the   Presidential  Legislatures  concerned   to   amend   the   localconstitution ordinances so as to provide for  (1) the substitution of an unofficial majority for the official &quot;bloc&quot; as contemplated at the commencement of paragraph 3; and (2) for the Governors overriding powers as indicated in paragraph 6under (iii).In addition, amendment to the constitution ordinances of Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis and Montserrat will be required to provide for the franchise, the holding of elections and other matters connected therewith. As intimated in my despatch under reference the basis of the franchise will be a matter for separate consideration.8. I trust that the foregoing observations will furnish you and your legal advisers with a clear indication of the legislative action which will be necessary to give effect to the proposals under consideration, in the event of these proving acceptable to the unofficial element in the Legislatures of the several Presidencies concerned.I have, &amp;c.P.
