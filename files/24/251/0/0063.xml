HIS J)OCuMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).m283  (34) COPY NO.CABINET. POST OFFICE (AMENDMENT) BILL. Memorandum by the Postmaster General.In the list of Bills proposed for the Parliamentary Session 1934-35 there was included a Post Office and Telegraph Act (Amendment) Bill.    As the Telegraph part of this Bill was controversial, the Bill was included by the Home Affairs Committee among the Bills consideration of which must stand over for the present.I now ask for the approval of the Cabinet in principle to the  introduction when time permits of a Bill dealing with the Post Office section of the original Bill. If approved, the Bill would be submitted to the Home Affairs Committee.The Bill is required for two purposes:-Firstly to bring the Post Office Act, 1908,  into accord with modern conditions and to remove restrictions which have been found to impede the development of new services.    It is desirable to give the Postmaster General adequate statutory authority for providing certain existing services for the public.    The Bill would also enable the Postmaster General to continue the development of the Post Office on modern business lines: for example,  it would apply the Post Office Act 190S to aircraft,  of which increased use for the transport of mails is made every year.The second purpose of the Bill is to effect certain amendments of the Post Office Act, 1908, without,   which,by
by reason of the Statute of Westminster, consolidation of existing Post Office legislation is impossible.The Post Office Act, 1908, contains numerous references to &quot;British Possessions&quot; and to &quot;His Majesty1s Dominions&quot; which are no longer permissible upon re-enactment without the consent of all the Dominions.   A number of the minor amendments are designed to repeal these expressions and replace them by others which are unobjectionable.The Bill would be entirely non-contentious.K.W.6 December, 1934.
