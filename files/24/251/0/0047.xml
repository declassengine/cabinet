THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1934.MOST SECRET. Copy No.     ^4CP. 272 (34).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.CO-ORDINATION OF TRADE POLICY.Report of Inter-Departmental Committee on Thirteenth Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council on Economic Information.(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister with reference to Cabinet 30 (34).Conclusion 6.)WE were requested by the Cabinet to consider the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council* as soon as it was ready, and present our comments thereon at the earliest date in Octobert for consideration by the Cabinet. Authority has been obtained for the addition to our membership of a representative of the Foreign Office.GENERAL.2. The Report,! taken as a whole, appears to us to be an impressive docu-ment, and to contain a vivid survey of the fundamental issues with which our economic policy is faced. It did not appear to us that any useful purpose would be served if we were to review again the issues dealt writh, and the summary of conclusions (pages 20-22 of the Report) is hardly capable of further compres-sion. We have thought, therefore, that our comments should relate to the effect of the application of the principles stated in the Report, assuming that those principles are accepted by the Cabinet.3. The Report sets out very clearly the way in which the economic structures of the United Kingdom and of primary producing countries have been built up (often through the investment in the latter of British capital) upon the basis of specialisation, the United Kingdom concentrating upon industrial production and combining a high standard of life with low costs of production by means of unrestricted duty-free imports of food and raw materials. After dealing with the various factors which have tended to upset the smooth working of this arrangement and we would add in this connection that the policies of extreme agricultural self-sufficiency adopted by most Continental countries have greatly aggravated the difficulties caused by the depression the Report reaches the conclusion that the economic relationship between the United Kingdom and the primary producing countries, on which their prosperity was originally developed, should in essentials be retained.4. In this connection the committee. state that they were specially asked to direct their attention to the restriction of imports.   But it is, as they point* For Report of the Committee see CP. 284 (34).f In the event the Report was not available until nearly the end of October, and for this and other reasons it has not been possible to adhere strictly to the time table laid down.% In all that follows, &quot;the Report&quot; means the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council, and &quot;the Committee &quot; means that Committee, the present Inter-Depart-mental Committee being referred to in the first person.
out, important not to overstress the restriction of imports as though it were tne only or even the major factor which may react unfavourably upon our over-seas trade. The Committee state that they did not deal with the effects of future foreign exchange policy, future policy in regard to foreign lending, or general recovery of world trade (including possible reductions of restrictions on imports by means of negotiations) on the volume of our exports. They express, however, the view that our exports are likely to depend to a materially greater extent upon these factors than upon any future extension of import restrictions unless the latter were pushed to extremes.APPLICATION TO INDUSTRY.5. The Committee express the conviction that the maintenance of a large scale export trade is vital to our national prosperity. Owing to the changes which have taken place in world conditions, the outlook for our old staple lines of export, whether in the immediate future or looking further ahead, cannot be regarded as bright. Every effort should continue to be made to rationalise these industries and improve their marketing methods, but we cannot hope to recover our pre-war position in these lines. If we are to hold our own in world exports, we shall require great adaptability and enterprise, and we must more than ever keep in the van of new developments. The Committee recall the report of the Economic Mission to the Argentine in 1929 on the need of developing trade in terms of motor cars, gramophones and radio sets; and they point out that in 1929 the United States of America exported such newer classes of manufacture to the value of  200 millions. The development of these and similar new industries must &quot;depend mainly on the initiative and enersjv of our manufacturers; but the need of encouraging them should be taken into account in framing our fiscal policy, and should be borne in mind in connection with proposals for the regulation of prices and production in industry under statutory powers. There is at present a considerable body of opinion (by no means confined to one political party) which holds that the Government should intervene in manufacturing industry to a much greater extent than in the past, and has proposed that legis-lation should be introduced which would enable the views of a majority in an industry in regard to organisation, selling prices and volume of production to be enforced upon a minority. While every effort should be made to encourage the voluntary reorganisation of industry, the introduction of a quasi-monopoly under statutory powers might force the Government into an undesirable degree of responsibility for prices, wages and profits. Such a development might tend to dull those qualities of individual enterprise and initiative to which so much of our industrial and commercial progress has been due in the past, and which will be of even greater importance in the export trade of the future.Level of Import Duties.6. Adaptability, however, will not suffice unless our costs of production compare favourably with those of our competitors. This involves, among other things, access to supplies of materials at prices no higher than those which prevail elsewhere. This need is universally recognised in the case of raw materials proper (such as raw cotton, wool, iron ore), but it is not always so fully appreciated in the case of those manufactured goods which are the materials of other industries. The Committee point out (paragraph 50) that the effect of the tariffs already imposed has been to cut down drastically our principal imports of manufactured goods and they express the opinion that taking account &quot;of the substantial measure of protection which our industries now enjoy, the strong subsequent presumption that the manufactured goods which we still import could not be produced easily or cheaply at home, and of the extent to which it is true that the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another, it seems improbable that any further material gain to employment, and not unlikely that serious indirect loss, would result from an extension of industrial protection. Indeed, it is not unlikely that the degree of protection which is already afforded to many industries, while stimulating in its immediate effects, and perhaps necessary during a slump, may entail counterbalancing disadvantages which
8289will prove increasingly serious as time goes on.&quot; The Committee add that it is perhaps too soon to attempt to measure how far this is SO; but they set out in Appendix I to their Report a list of statistical criteria which should be available to anyone attempting to weigh from the short period point of view the advantages or disadvantages of protection in particular instances.7. The opinion expressed by the Committee on this point, in favour of caution in further increases of industrial protection, is of interest in view of the apprehension excited in certain quarters by the increase which has taken place during the past year in the imports classified in the Trade Accounts as &quot; wholly or mainly manufactured.&quot; But an analysis of the imports in question appears to confirm the view expressed by the Committee. Of these imports over 40 per cent, are such commodities as oils, non-ferrous metal products, &amp;c, which are in the nature of materials and are for the most part non-competitive; while a further large proportion consist of machinery and other goods which are of a special character or which for various reasons cannot be produced so cheaply or in sufficient quantity at home and which are imported for equipment or further manufacture. The remaining items do not represent a large total and in many cases they have been the subject of recent increases of duties, or they are the subject of pending applications before the Import Duties Advisory Committee or they fall under the provisions of the Ottawa Agreements or Trade Agreements with foreign countries, or of special duties. In considering the level of our tariffs account has to be taken not only of our imports, but of our exports of manu-factured goods; and the statistics show that our position, on balance, in regard to such goods has been steadily improving.8. It appears that the Import Duties Advisory Committee, as might be expected, have followed closely the course of recent imports and have recommended increased duties, where such action appeared to be justified. On the other hand, they have also rejected certain applications. e.g.. in the case of cash registers and carpets. The present arrangements should, generally speaking, ensure a reasonable balance between the claims of producers and consumers. But it is undoubtedly easier to secure evidence from producers than from consumers. The Import Duties Advisory Committee have, of course, before recommending a duty, to advertise the application and to hear representations from any industry affected, and this should normally secure adequate considera-tion of the effects of any proposal on industries to which the product in question is an important factor. There may, however, be certain cases in which for various reasons (including the reluctance of manufacturers to oppose increased duties when they may themselves wish presently to apply for higher protection) it is difficult to obtain satisfactory representations from the standpoint of the consuming industries. The statistical criteria suggested by the Committee might be of special value in such cases.Interpretation of Import Duties Act.9. The observations of the Committee raise, by implication, a wider consideration bearing upon the level of import duties generally. At the time when the Import Duties Act was passed, our exchange position gave rise to grave apprehensions, and the Import Duties Advisory Committee were accordingly instructed, by Section 3 (2) of the Import Duties Act, &apos;&apos; to have regard to the advisability in the national interest of restricting imports into the United Kingdom.&quot; The Section goes on to require them to have regard also to &quot; the interests generally of trade and industry in the United Kingdom, including those of trades and industries which are consumers of goods as well as those of trades and industries which are producers of goods,&quot; but the first provision taken by itself might seem to imply not merely a restriction of imports as compared with 1931, but a progressive restriction of imports, which would not be in the national interests. The position since the Import Duties Act was passed has befm greatly modified, in that our exchange position is now stronger than that of the majority of countries from whom our principal imports are drawn. The Committee point out (paragraphs 42 and 43 of their Report) that measures adopted to reduce the value of our imports, particularly in their application to countries which are in a weaker financial and exchange position than ourselves, may have a deflationary effect upon world conditions, and so react
prejudicially upon our exports both directly and indirectly. For example, the possibility of operating successfully the new agreement with Germany, with the safeguards which it contains for our commercial and financial interests, will depend essentially on the maintenance of German exports to the United Kingdom at approximately their present level. Apart from this, in a period of expanding trade, it would be undesirable to prevent all increases in imports, even of competitive goods, as it would be unwise to embark capital upon expanding our domestic production to cover the full marginal requirements, e.g., of the present building boom. We understand that the Import Duties Advisory Committee have not interpreted Section 3 of the Import Duties Act as enjoining a progressive and continuing process of restriction, but have considered this provision as governed by the subsequent reference to the interest of trade and industry. It is always possible, however, that critics of the Import Duties Advisory Committee may fasten upon the first part of their terms of reference, and if so, it would be desirable to make clear that the view taken by the Committee (paragraph 43 of their Report) as to the bearing of the altered exchange position on the advisability of restricting imports has the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.10. The level of the import duties under the Import Duties Act is a matter, in the first instance, for the Import Duties Advisory Committee. As stated above, we believe that the Import Duties Advisory Committee have the situation constantly under review and that they have preserved a fair balance between the different interests concerned. But in view of the constant pressure upon them for increases of duties, it might be well to communicate to them, for their consideration, the suggestions made in the Report and these comments.APPLICATION TO AGRICULTURE.General Principles.11. Against the background which the Committee have drawn in para-graphs (1) to (13) of their conclusions and to which we have referred above, two main principles are suggested in paragraph (14) which should guide our agricultural policy.   These are (a) We should avoid measures calculated to raise materially the prices of essential foodstuffs to the British public above the level which would otherwise prevail, or to entail a progressive reduction in the volume of our food imports.(b) We should contrive, however, in times of severe depression of worldagricultural prices, to secure reasonable prices for our farmers, sufficient to maintain financial solvency and to avert exhaustion of capital, impairment of equipment or curtailment of production.12. It may be useful to summarise the grounds for regarding the first principle as important. It is clear that to restrict imports of agricultural produce beyond a certain point may have serious reactions upon those countries whose economy has been developed on the assumption of a growing market, particularly in the United Kingdom. Although as recovery proceeds there may be a further increase in food consumption over a short period, it Avould be unwise to rely upon this possibility and it seems certain that before long the United Kingdom market will shrink owing to the fall in numbers and change in age distribution of the population which is now inevitable. We would draw particular attention to the vital statistics set out and explained in paragraphs 11 to 20 of the Report. Similar changes are taking place in most European countries. The countries which must feel the unfavourable effect of these coming changes on the demand for their exports are the very countries on which we depend not only as markets, but also because we have invested very large sums in their development. Among the countries principally affected by our agricultural policy are Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. United Kingdom capital invested in Australia and New Zealand is estimated at over  600 million (mainly Govern-ment and municipal securities), while British investments in Argentina are estimated at  450 million, making the total invested in the three countries over  1,000 million.   Both the income derived from this capital and its market value
are, of course, liable to great variation with changes in economic conditions in these countries, and any serious doubt as to the future solvency of Australia or New Zealand would have grave effects on the whole market for gilt edged and other trustee securities.VS. If we develop our own agriculture at the expense of imports, the fall in purchasing power abroad will be offset by some compensating rise in purchasing power at home, in so far as additional employment is provided in agriculture and ancillary industries. But the change over would m any case involve an additional problem of transference (it would, for example, accentuate the difficulties of shipping), and unless it could be effected without a material increase in the general level of food prices it might substantially prejudice our industrial market. If as a result of restricting imports of foodstuffs or through any other form of Government intervention food prices are materially raised, one of two things must happen :-(1) The industial worker&apos;s money wages are left unchanged. In this case he must either (a) restrict or modify his purchases of food (involving probably a further restriction of imports if home agriculture is to be safeguarded), or (b) restrict his purchases of other goods, with a depressing effect on industry.(2) Alternatively, the industrial worker&apos;s money wages are raised. In this case the cost of production is increased, the price of manufactured goods rises, export trade is depressed and the benefit to the farmer of increased prices of agricultural produce is to some extent nullified. The dangers of the &apos;&apos; vicious spiral &apos;&apos; by which increased prices lead to increased wages and increased wages to further price increases are well known.14. Although we have thought it right to emphasise the dangers which would flow from a material increase in food prices in general or from excessive restriction of imports, we do not wish to convey the impression that the Govern-ment&apos;s agricultural policy has produced these undesirable results. The wholesale food index has fallen steadily over the last decade and reached its lowest point this year. Meanwhile, there has been a fall in the number of persons employed in home agriculture due to a variety of causes including low prices, and without any reduction of output. It is clear that, up to the present, the measures that have been adopted for the assistance of agriculture have not had the effect of raising the cost of living, nor have they been sufficient to arrest the downward trend in agricultural employment. What they have done is to limit the benefit to the consumer of the fail in world prices due to glut conditions in the last few years, and to prevent the further fall in domestic prices which would otherwise have taken place.Costs of Distribution.15. We have pointed out in the preceding paragraphs the need for maintaining low costs of production, both in industry and agriculture, and the importance of avoiding, so far as possible, a rise in the cost of living. In this connection, we would call attention to the equally great importance of maintaining low cost of distribution, not only of food-stuffs, but of manufactured goods. The cost of living is obviously dependent, to a considerable degree, on this factor. In regard to many articles of food, distribution costs are at least as great as production costs, and the case for securing that the former should not be unreasonably high is, therefore, an equally strong one. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that&apos;in recent years the spread between retail and wholesale prices of food has tended to increase. Moreover, it is not without interest to note (E.A.C. Report, Table 5) that, during the last decade, the distributive trades showed a larger increase in employment than any of the other trades listed. Whilst suggesting that these figures in themselves are no cause for misgiving, the Committee believe that &quot; there is much waste in the organisation of our distributive trades.&quot; We would suggest that the question of reducing the cost of distribution is one to which attention should also be directed.
Extent of Agricultural Protection.16. Subject to the above considerations, the case put forward in the Report for the first principle taken by itself is that the further development of farming here is harmless to industry only in so far as food prices are not thereby raised materially above the level that would otherwise prevail. We appreciate that, pushed to its logical conclusion, this argument would lead to the denial of any protection to the farming industry in this country. The Committee do not suggest such an extreme conclusion, and, indeed, it would be unthinkable. His Majesty&apos;s Government, we imagine, would fully endorse the principle set out in paragraph 14 (b) of the Report (emoted in paragraph 11 above). With the development of self-sufficiency in Europe, the United Kingdom became more than ever the principal for some commodities almost the only world market, and &quot; as the depression deepened, farm produce poured in at prices which often had no relation to the cost of production in this country or abroad. Now that we have adopted a system of industrial protection, farmers would have just ground for complaint if they wrere exposed to the full blast of the economic blizzard, particularly when agricultural wages in England and Wales are being regulated under the Act of 1924 and have been virtually maintained at their 1925 level in a period of falling prices. It is, we take it, a recognised national interest to adopt such measures as will secure the maintenance of a stable and reasonably prosperous agricultural population.17. Whatever temporary measures may be necessary to safeguard the agricultural industry against the present crisis must be framed with due regard to the interests which we have, as an industrial and exporting country, in keeping the food supplies of the people cheap and plentiful. Our long-term policy should, therefore, generally speaking, aim at supporting those branches of agriculture for which this country has natural advantages and which can be pursued without involving a serious rise in the cost of living. The Committee recommend that such efforts as we make to expand agricultural output, as distinct from securing a reasonable degree of stability of prices for our existing output, should be concentrated on those agricultural commodities which can be produced with advantage to quality in areas adjacent to large consuming centres or which we are otherwise especially well fitted to produce. The Committee go on to point out that increased consumption of such articles is desirable from the point of view of the nation&apos;s health, but that, if their consumption is to be stimulated, it is necessary that they should remain cheap. They add that the importance of keeping in the van of newr developments, already referred to in connection with manufactured exports, applies also to these articles. In general. Marketing Boards and similar organisations should have clearly before them as their objective such economies and improvements in methods as will enable home agriculture to compete with overseas agriculture.Considerations of Imperial and Foreign Policy.18. We have hitherto dealt with economic considerations, but there are also considerations of Imperial and foreign policy to which attention may be drawn. As regards the former, wre need hardly stress the effect on Imperial solidarity of any measures that might cause serious embarrassment in the Dominions, having regard to the large proportion that exports of foodstuffs bear to their total trade. At the Ottawa, Conference we established, not without difficulty, the principle that our industries should have &quot; full opportunities of reasonable competition &quot; in Dominion markets, and that tariffs imposed in favour of their industries should be limited to cases in which there was reasonable assurance Of &quot; sound opportunities for success,&quot; having regard to efficient and economical production. When the Agreements come to be reviewed, it may well be found that the Dominions will ask that the protection of agriculture in the United Kingdom should be governed by the same principles; and although at present the Empire countries have no serious ground for complaint, t there are already indications that public opinion in the Dominions is being roused on this point.f In 1928 the oversea Empire accounted for 36 per cent, of total food imports into the United Kingdom. By 1982 this proportion had risen to 41 per cent. There is reason to believe that home production was approximately constant during that period, when the Empire appears to have enjoyed an expanding share of an expanding market. In the post-Ottawa years the position has been even more favourable to oversea Empire producers, imports from Empire countries having continued to expand, notwithstanding a decline in total imports.
19. As regards foreign policy, to curtail beyond a certain point exports from countries whose economy is linked with ours cannot but react upon our general relations with those countries, as well as upon their internal stability. It is unnecessary to stress the importance of meat to the South American countries (particularly Argentina and Uruguay). Exports of bacon are of importance not only to Denmark, but also in greater or less degree to Holland, Poland, and all the Scandinavian and Baltic countries whose friendship with us is a political factor of importance, and the same countries would be among those affected if any restrictions were to be imposed upon imports of butter and eggs. The com-mercial agreements which have been negotiated during the last two years with Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania (and an agreement with Poland, now on the point of conclusion) are all so timed as to expire towards the end of 1936. Subsequent commercial negotiations with these countries will depend largely upon continuance of consideration for their exports to the United Kingdom.Methods of Assisting Agriculture.(a) Quantitative Restriction... 20. If His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the principles which it is proposed in,the Report should govern our agricultural policy, the methods by which the degree of assistance proposed would best be given require to be carefully considered. Import duties alone would not serve the purpose. Under conditions of acute depression, import duties could only be effective if raised to a prohibitive level, as they tend to be paid by the overseas producer or counterbalanced by export bounties and exchange depreciation; moreover, in the case of many important commodities, the provisions of the Ottawa Agreements and of subsequent commercial agreements with foreign countries would require to be modified before we could impose import duties. Accordingly, the system of quantitative regulation of imports has been largely relied on in the last few years. It has been applied, in various forms, to bacon, meat, fish, potatoes, eggs, oats, and milk products (see Appendix). But this method has not yet led to the adoption of international schemes for the regulation of production, as had been hoped. It has raised or maintained the prices of the imports permitted above the prices that foreign countries would otherwise have been able to realise for their produce; but, so far from gaining us their goodwill, it has complicated, and to some extent prejudiced, our commercial relations with foreign countries, and any similar measures taken in regard to imports from the Dominions would put a severe strain upon inter-Imperial goodwill.(b) Financial Assistance.21. The Committee recommend that it would be better to replace the system of quantitative restriction on imports by a system involving less cost to the consumer. In practice, this involves some form of financial assistance to the home producer, in order to ensure him against the effect of unremunerative prices, and this method of dealing with the difficulty has important advantages over quantitative restriction of imports, viz. : (a) The income of the home producer can be raised to any given level atconsiderably less cost to the consumer than by quantitative restrictions of imports, since the latter system gives to such imports as are admitted the full benefit of the higher price level required for the home producer;(b) Quantitative restriction of imports would have to be intensified if wewere to continue to rely upon this method of supporting agriculture. This would be likely to lead to serious political and economic friction with the Dominions and foreign countries. On the other hand, the abandonment or modification of quantitative restriction (for whatever reasons) might assist the efforts we are making to secure a reduction of economic barriers generally an objective which the new French Government has put in the forefront of its programme, and which appears to be receiving an increasing degree of attention in the United States.
(c) If the financial assistance to the home producer is derived in whole orin part from a levy on imports, this method should tend to reconcile the domestic producer to acceptance of such imports.(d) It would in no way preclude arrangements for the better regulation ofproduction and marketing by the overseas producers themselves.Whatever form of financial assistance is accorded, it should be devised so as to encourage the maximum efficiency in domestic production and marketing; it should contain safeguards against undesigned increases of production; and it should include provision for automatic adjustment if the level of world prices should rise adequately.22. The form which such financial assistance can best take has to be considered by reference to each particular commodity. In general the Committee point to a system of subsidy financed by a levy on imports similar to that which is embodied in the Wheat Act, as one which might be adopted with advantage, where practicable. We assume that in cases where the subsidy is financed by a levy on imports, the levy would normally be coupled with a preference to the Dominions, the levy on foreign supplies being higher than on Dominion supplies.23. The suggestion of the Committee corresponds with the line already adopted by the Government as the basis of its long-term policy in regard to meat: and negotiations have been started with a view to securing the consent of the Dominions and Argentina, which, under the provisions of the Ottawa and Anglo-Argentine Agreements, are entitled to duty-free entry for their exports to the United Kingdom. At the moment these negotiations have not proved successful, and they do not appear too hopeful (see paragraph 27 below), but the situation might possibly be improved if we were able in return to offer satisfactory assurances as to our long-term policy in regard to imports. Even, however, if such agreement were unobtainable, and financial assistance to the home producer had to be provided from the Exchequer, we would still regard this form of assistance as preferable to the quantitative restriction of imports.Application to Particular Commodities.24. The Committee state that they do not attempt to pass judgment upon the merits of the detailed measures which have been adopted in different fields, and it would not be within our competence to do so. But it appears to us that the attention of the Cabinet should be drawn particularly to the effect of the Committee&quot;s recommendations in regard to bacon and meat.25. Bacon. The bacon scheme was avowedly intended to increase the home production by means of a progressive reduction of imported supplies, and if the principles in the E.A.C. Report are adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it would be necessary to consider their effect upon the scheme. Bacon prices in 1931-32 were below the cost of production, both at home and abroad, and the rise which has since taken place would probably to some extent have occurred in any event, but the reduction in total supplies from the peak figure of 1932 to the average figures of the years 1925-30 inclusive has undoubtedly been the main factor in raising the price of bacon in this country, and it should be possible to obtain equally satisfactory results for the home producers by means involving a lesser increase of price to the consumer. We suggest that considera-tion should be given to the question whether the bacon scheme should not now be reviewed in the light of experience of its working.26.   Meat. The long-term policy of the Government is set out in a White Paper presented to Parliament on the 11th July, 1934 (Cmd. 4651).   After . examining the possibility of (a) Drastic quantitative regulation;\b) A levy on imports of meat to provide a fund from which payments couldbe made to home producers along the lines of the Wheat Act, 1932,imports being unregulated; (c) A levy on imports and payments to producers as referred to under (b),coupled with some degree of direct supply regulation in the interestsof all suppliers;
ythe White Paper continues (paragraph 7) : &quot; The Government are of opinion that a plan based on a levy which would be on all imported meat, including livestock, and a regulated market, as in (c) above, would afford the best long-term solution of this problem and one which would hold the balance evenly between producer and consumer. It is not contemplated that the levy would exceed Id. per lb. with a preference for the Dominions.&quot;27. The practical application of this policy has to be related to the provisions, taken in conjunction, of the Ottawa Agreements and the Agreements with Argentina. A levy on imports would be inconsistent with the terms of these agreements and could only be imposed with the consent of the Governments concerned. As stated above, negotiations have already been opened with them with a view to the adoption of the levy-subsidy principle coupled with a measure of quantitative restriction, but the prospects are not at present hopeful. Australia is strongly opposed to the proposal, and such Dominions as might be prepared to accept it would probablj&apos; demand, in return, drastic restriction on foreign imports; while Argentina rejected the proposal on principle, but gave ground to suppose that it might be acceptable if coupled with a definite limitation of Dominion imports.28. If agreement to the imposition of a levy on meat imports is not forth-coming, financial assistance would have to take the form of a subsidy from public funds. Such a method would have all the advantages over a system of import restriction enumerated in paragraph 21, except that the assistance given to the United Kingdom farmer would not be derived from a fund directly dependent upon the acceptance of imports. Under a direct subsidy, United Kingdom producers would be sheltered from the effects of glut prices, but oversea producers would remain exposed to them. This might lead oversea producers to regulate their production in their own interests, while they would not be able to attribute their difficulties to the policy of the United Kingdom unless the subsidy gave rise to a marked increase in meat production in this country. There is perhaps some risk that, if prices fell to a very low level, a high subsidy to United Kingdom producers would be necessary, while the burden of interest payments on external debt would press more heavily upon oversea countries. This risk, however, applies equally to a subsidy financed by levy. Our conclusion is that efforts should be renewed to secure the agreement of the countries concerned to the imposition of a levy, by offering assurances as to our long-term policy, but that assistance to the home producer should take the form of a subsidy even if agreement to a levy is unattainable.29. This subsidy would have to be one that would not lead to a marked expansion of production. While the Ottawa Agreements and the Agreements with Argentina do not preclude either an expansion of home production or quantitative regulation^ their combined effect is. in practice, to limit narrowly the scope for possible action.30. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in relation to meat production is declared in the United Kingdom-Australia Agreement to be, first, to secure development of home production, and, secondly, to give to the Dominions an expanding share of imports into the United Kingdom. The Dominions have tended to give this declaration a wider significance from their point of view than is justified by the Agreement, and have claimed that it entitles them to an expanding volume of imports into the United Kingdom. In fact, owing to the prospective decline in our population, the United Kingdom market cannot be expected to expand at least at anything like the same rate as in the past few years. If, in these &quot;circumstances, the United Kingdom were to take action to expand its production* Indeed, during the currency of the United Kingdom-Australia Agreement we are bound to limit imports of foreign meat in any quarter to the following percentages of the imports in the corresponding quarter of 1932: Frozen mutton, lamb and beef   ... ... ... ...        65Chilled beef    ... ... ... ... ... ...       100It follows that some quantitative restriction of foreign meat imports must be maintained for the present, but that we are under no specific obligation to the Dominions to impose a further reduction.
of meat, at a time when the market would be contracting, the prospects for the Dominions would be disturbing, particularly if other markets remained closed to them, and they would have a pretext for attributing their difficulties to our policy. There might, of course, be an offset in some cases in increased exports of feeding stuffs, but this offset might not have any relationship to the reduced exports of meat from particular countries.31. The difficulties which a contraction of the market in such circumstances would create for the Dominions could only be removed by limiting further the imports of foreign meat on the expiration of the Argentine Agreement in November 1936; but such a limitation is not likely to be practicable Under the Roca Agreement Argentina was guaranteed that restrictions should only be placed on imports of chilled beef &quot; to secure a remunerative level of prices in the United Kingdom market,&quot; and that such restrictions below the Ottawa level would not be maintained if excluded imports were replaced by increased imports of other kinds of meat (other than experimental shipments of Empire chilled beef). It was further agreed that if imports of Argentine chilled beef were reduced by more than 10 per cent, below the Ottawa level, imports of Empire meat would also be reduced by a percentage equal to the excess over 10 per cent, of Argentine reductions. These undertakings were indispensable to the conclusion-of the Agreement, and had their justification in the very important financial and economic interests of the United Kingdom in the Argentine, and when the present agreements expire some similar assurances will undoubtedly be asked for in respect of the future.32. Thus, in the case of meat, the political commitments entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Dominions and foreign countries tend in the same direction as the economic arguments adduced by the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council in favour of their recommendation against a policy involving a progressive reduction in the volume of our food imports, and it appears to us that account must be taken of these considerations in formulating policy for home agriculture. If imports are not to be further restricted, and as the total consumption is tending to decline, there would appear to be little possibility, without artificial aid, of securing remunerative prices for any expansion of the domestic production of meat, at any rate until there is an expansion in the consumption of meat in the rest of the world. Yet this is one of the main fields in which expansion of British agriculture is possible.CORRELATION OF INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY.33. It is clear that an agricultural policy limited as suggested by the Economic Advisory Council Report cannot provide any substantial remedy for unemployment, while, if the economic analysis in that Report is accepted, the indirect effect on unemployment of a substantially more expansive policy might well be adverse. We believe that the most hopeful prospect of absorbing the working population of the country in the comparatively near future is by the normal industrial occupations for which this country is peculiarly well fitted. The prospective fall in the population should facilitate reabsorption, but we fear that attempts to stimulate agricultural production of a non-competitive kind would retard the process. Meanwhile, the measures necessary to support agriculture should be calculated to disturb as little as possible the costs of production and the markets on which our industries depend, and so devised that they can be automatically reduced if world agricultural prices recover to an economic level. Expenditure on subsidies required for this purpose can be fully justified as the best means of reconciling our industrial and agricultural requirements.34. Finally, we would draw the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the desirability that any decision reached on long-term policy should be clearly and definitely formulated and at the proper occasion given the widest publicity, together with an indication of the measures which the Government intend to adopt during the present period of depression of agricultural prices. While the actual measures taken up to the present time in support of United Kingdom agriculture have not, we believe, materially prejudiced either the position of our industrial population or the interests of our overseas suppliers, much appre-hension exists in the Dominions and in foreign countries overseas as to their possible extension, and it would be very desirable to allay such apprehensions if
they have no foundation. If it be decided that assurances as to our long-term policy can be given, the question should be considered before any public-announcement is made, whether we could not, in return for such assurances, obtain freedom from existing engagements as to free entry for agricultural products (see paragraph 28).SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.35. The Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council seems to us to contain a clear exposition of the objectives which, in their opinion, should govern our industrial and agricultural policies in their interaction on our overseas interests, both Dominion and foreign. The Committee directed their attention specially to the question of restrictions of imports, but they point out that wider factors (e.g.. currency policy and general trade recovery) may be of even greater importance (paragraph 61 of their Report). Assuming that the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council is acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (1) It would be desirable to transmit to the Import Duties Advisory Committee for their consideration the conclusions and suggestions of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council (a) as to the bearing of the altered  exchange position on  the advisability of restricting imports (paragraph 9);(b) as  to  the  level  of  protection   to  be  accorded   to  industryparagraph 6); and(c) as to the statistical criteria to be applied to claims for protection(paragraph 8).(2) During the last decade, the distributive trades showed a larger increase in employment than any other industry in this country, and in view of the opinion expressed (E.A.C. Report, paragraph 55) that &quot; there is much waste in the organisation of our distributive trades,&quot; the possibility of reducing the cost of distribution is one to which attention should be directed (paragraph 15).(3) Our long-term policy in regard to domestic agriculture should be directed to supporting those branches of the industry for which this country has natural advantages and which can be pursued without involving a serious rise in the cost of living. Efforts to expand agricultural output should be concentrated on those commodities which can be produced in this country with advantage to quality (paragraph 17).(4) In times of severe depression of world agricultural prices, however, measures should be taken to maintain domestic production, and should be so devised as to secure the maintenance of a stable and reasonably prosperous agricultural population (paragraphs 16 and 17).(5) The measures taken in respect of any commodity should in general be such as will raise its price to the consumer as little as possible paragraph 17). They should also be devised so as to encourage the maximum efficiency in domestic production and marketing; should contain safeguards against undesigned increases of production; and should include provision for automatic adjustment if the level of world prices should rise adequately (paragraph 21).(6) The income of the home producer can be raised to any given level by a system of subsidy at less cost to the consumer than by the restriction of imports (paragraph 21). While a system of subsidy is to be preferred to the quantitative regulation of imports, even if the subsidy has to be provided from the Exchequer, it should where practicable be financed by levies on imports (paragraphs 22 and 23).(7) Where we are precluded by existing agreements from imposing levies on imports of agricultural commodities the home production of which it is desired to support, we should make every effort possible to obtain by negotiation the modification of these agreements. It will be necessary to offer the exporting countries an inducement to abandon their rights of free entry into this market. This inducement should take the form of assurances as to our long-term policy in regard to agricultural imports (paragraphs 23 and 27-8).
December 3, 1934.(8) If the above conclusions Nos. (3) to (7) meet with the approval of the Government, their application to particular commodities will need careful consideration. We have accordingly suggested that the working of the bacon scheme should be reviewed (paragraph 25), and we have dealt with the considerations arising in connection with meat (paragraphs 26-32).(9) The widest publicity should at the appropriate occasion be given to a considered statement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments long-term policy, together with an indication of the measures which the Government intend to adopt during the present period of depression of agricultural prices (paragraph 34).36. In submitting this Report we desire to remark that it covers a. wide field of Government policy in regard to which our individual knowledge necessarily relates only to particular parts; and though it can be taken as representing our general view, it contains passages which some of us might wish to qualify and others to emphasise.37. We are much indebted to our Secretary, Mr. K. Hale, of the Treasury, for the assistance which he has given us in our work..  F. W. LKITH-ROSS. F. ASHTON-GWATKIN. E. J. HARDING. CHARLES J. H. THOMAS.

APPENDIX.Summary of Arrangements for the Quantitative Regulation of Imports ofA g ricultural Products.1. Ottawa Agreements Act, 1932.Foreign Chilled Beef. The maximum quantity of foreign chilled beef per-mitted to be imported was fixed at 100 per cent, of the quantity imported in the corresponding quarter of the standard year.[By voluntary arrangement imports in the fourth quarter of 1934 are being limited to 88-1- per cent, of the quantity imported in the corresponding quarter of the standard year. Over the whole year 1934 imports will be approximately 90 per cent, of the quantity imported in the standard year.]Foreign Frozen Beef.- Permitted imports of frozen beef (carcasses and boned beef) and veal from foreign sources are at the maximum allowed under the Ottawa Agreements, namely, 65 per cent, of the quantity imported in the corresponding quarter of the standard year.[Under voluntary arrangements the importers have agreed to regulate imports of frozen beef offals in conformity with the reduction of imports of carcase beef (chilled and frozen).]Foreign Frozen Mutton and Lamb. Permitted imports from foreign countries are also at the maximum allowed under the Agreements, namely, 65 per cent, of the quantity imported in the corresponding quarter of the standard year.2. Agricultural Marketing Act, 1933.Cattle (Import Regidation) Order, 1933. The Order prohibits the impor-tation into the United Kingdom from the Irish Free State of beef and veal and beef and veal offals, and, except under licence, of fat cattle, store cattle, and dry cows and bulls showing permanent incisor teeth. Under the licensing system imports of fat cattle are being limited to 50 per cent., and of other cattle to 100 per cent, of the numbers imported in the corresponding quarter of 1933.Bacon (Import Regidation) Order, 1934. Under this Order imports of bacon and hams from foreign countries are regulated in such a manner that, together with home and Dominion supplies, total supplies of bacon and hams in the United Kingdom shall not exceed for the time being a level of about 10,670,000 cwt. per annum, this being the average of total supplies in the year 1925-1930. This has involved the reduction of foreign imports by restriction from approximately 1H million cwt. in 1931 and 1932 to less than 7 million cwt. in the present year. Allocations to foreign countries in 1935 are expected to be about 6,000,000 cwt. Imports from Empire countries have increased from 438,337 cwt. in 1931 to 2,000,000 cwt., the expected figure for 1935, but the net result has been a decline in total imports from 12 million cwt. in 1931 and 1932 to 8-^ million cwt. in 1934, and a further fall to 8 million cwt. is expected next year. United Kingdom production has increased from If million cwt. in 1930 to 2-  million cwt. in 1934.Potato (Import Regulation) Order, 1934. Under this Order, which came into operation on the 8th November, imports of main crop potatoes from the supplying countries, i.e., the Irish Free State and foreign countries, are being regulated according to market requirements, having regard to the size of the home crop. The Market Supply Committee anticipate that the current home crop will be sufficient for market requirements, but in accordance with the Committee&apos;s recom-mendation a nominal quantity of 20,000 tons will be admitted during the season. It is also intended to permit the importation of reasonable quantities of early potatoes from February or March, 1935, onwards.3. Sea Fishing Industry A ct, 1933.Under the Sea Fishing Industry (Regulation of Landing) Order, 1933, which came into operation in August 1933, landings of foreign-caught sea-fish are limited to 90 per cent, of average landings 1930 to 1932. No further limitation is contemplated.
4. Voluntary Arrangements.Processed Milks (Cream, Condensed Milk and Milk Powder). Regulation was introduced June 1933, when the main foreign exporting countries were asked to reduce supplies, June to September, by 20 per cent, compared with the corre-sponding period of 1932. These arrangements have been extended from time to time. Reductions in operation for present quarter are : cream, 35 per cent.; condensed whole milk and condensed skimmed milk, 30 per cent.; milk powder, 25 per cent.Dominions other than the Irish Free State are co-operating on the basis of standstill on the figures for twelve months June 1932 to May 1933. Irish Free State supplies are being reduced by about half the cuts applied to foreign supplies.Oats and Oat Products. When the import duties on oats and oat products from foreign sources were raised in September 1933 the Canadian Government undertook to do their best to limit exports of those products to the United Kingdom in the twelve months from August 1933 to the average of the previous two years. The Canadian Government have now been approached regarding a further arrangement of that kind for the current cereal year.Eggs in Shell. Foreign exporting countries were asked to arrange that supplies of eggs in shell arriving on the United Kingdom market in the period the 15th March to the 30th September last would not exceed the quantities in the corresponding period of 1933. Proposals have now been made for a reduction of foreign supplies by 5 per cent, in the last quarter of 1934 and 10 per cent, in the first quarter of 1935 compared with imports in the corresponding quarters of 1933-34. Smaller reductions are being applied to the Irish Free State and the other Dominions have been invited to co-operate on the basis of a standstill.Canadian Cattle. The Canadian Government anticipate that shipments of cattle to the United Kingdom during the second half of 1934 will be about 29,000 head, so that over the whole year imports will be approximately the same as in 1933.Dominion Meat. A programme for the regulation of imports of meat (chilled beef, frozen beef, including veal, frozen mutton and lamb, and frozen pork) in the six months July to December 1934 has been placed before Dominion Governments and a substantial measure of agreement has been secured. A further programme covering the three months January to March 1935 has now been communicated to the Dominions.Frozen Pork. A voluntary arrangement has been made with importers for the regulation of imports of frozen pork from U.S.A. and the Argentine in the second half of this year. Proposals for the first quarter of 1935, involving a limitation of imports to the average of the figures for the first quarter of the years 1932-3-4, have now been communicated to the importers.Canned Beef. Imports of canned beef (other than tongues) from foreign countries are being limited by voluntary arrangements to a quantity now exceeding that imported in 1933.o
