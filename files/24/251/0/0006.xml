Confidential. A.0.307.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY OOUNOIL.State of Trade; September, 1934.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Oduhoil Csupplemented in some oases with statistical information rrora other sources).Overseas Trade.    Imports in September at  57.7 million showed practically no increase over the previous September.-Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  34.0 million against  30*3 million, and re-exports  3e2 million against  ^.4 million a year ago.   The excess of imports over exports for the 9 months up to 30th September was  208*1 million? and for the corresponding period of last year  182*1 million.EMPLOYMENT *     There was a substantial improvement In employment during September.The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 24th September was 2,081,987, a decrease of 54,591 as compared with 20th August.The main variations were:-London.......... 4- 3,391South Eastern ... * 6,951South Western ... + 6,237Midlands  ........ -34,313North Eastern  ... -31,618Northwestern ... - 9,388Scotland ........ + 8,871Wales  ........... - 4,722The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 24th September was 10,233,000.    This was 63,000 more than a month before, and 352,000 more than a year before.Improvement in employment was most marked in coal mining and the boot and shoe, pottery and woollen and worsted industries.   There was also some improvement in most of the other textile industries, in dressmaking and millinery, the hat and oap, iron and steel, tinplate, leather and furniture industries, and In the manufacture of ooooa, ohooolate, etc.-1-
On the other hand employment declined in building and public works contracting, stone mining and quarrying, the distributive trades, the hotel, boarding house and shipping services, the linen industry, glass bottle making and certain food manufacturing industries .ROAD AND RAIL TRAFFIO .   During the four weeks ended 30th September, railway traffic receipts Increased by  465,000 (4$) over the corresponding period of 1935, the increase in passenger traffic being 2*3%, in oc-al, coke and patent fuel 9*4$, and in other freight traffic 3.5$o     For the 39 weeks ended 30th September the total reoeipts amounted to  112.4 ra, as against  10706 m. in the same period of 1933.Motor vehicles newly registered in August amounted to16,616, an Increase of 1,960 (13.45*) over a year ago.     Theincrease comprised 1,086 private cars and 874 other vehicles.2^07 motor cycles were newly registered, an inorease of 4.3^over the previous August.FINANOF AND BANKING.   Money was very easy in September and13 7Bill rates fell from fand fefa for one, two and three months&apos; Bills to ^g , ^g   and in the middle of the month.Subsequently the Banks raised rates but found it difficult to acquire sufficient 3ills, and, as a result no doubt of competition by the Banks for end of December Bills, Treasury Bills were allotted at 12/lld.  , 10/6d.j5 and 9/3d.$ on the 7th, 14th and 21st respectively.     There was a continued rise in gold, silver and gilt edged securities, gold and War Loan reaching record prices while silver touched its. highest point since December, 1920.     Paradoxically the rise in gold was accompanied by a rise  (probably seasonal)  in the dollar rate.   Sterling was weak throughout the month both against the frano and the dollar.OPAL. The average weekly output of ooal during the thirteen weeks ended 22nd September was 3,956,000 tons as compared with 3,671,000 tons in the same quarter of 1933, an
increase of 6 per oent.     The average number of persons employed during thiB period was 762,900 as against 756,600 a year before.The home consumption of ooal and coke in August was 15 per oent. higher than in August, 1933.     Exports in September at 3,541,000 tons were 124,000 tons more than a year earlier.     Increased tonnages were again consigned to Scandinavian oountries, Finland and Argentina, but exports to Franoe, Italy and Germany declined as compared with a year ago. There was, however, a substantial increase In the tonnage consigned to Egypt.     Imports of Polish ooal Into the Irish Free State again increased in August at the expense of imports from Great Britain and Germany.The tone of the Industry is healthier on the whole, though the rate of advanoe is slow.IRON AND STEEL.   Conditions in the iron and steel industry showed a definite improvement in practioally all departments after the seasonal recession in August.     The bulk of the business continues to be on home account, though there Is some expansion in certain sections of the export trade.     Competition from Continental producers in the domestic market, for semi-finished steel Is still a serious problem.The output of pig iron was 500,000 tons in September as compared with 50^,000 tons in August and 360,000 tons in September last year.     Steel production was 735,000 tons as oompared with 667,000 tons in August and 669,000 tons in September last year.*n Scotland production is being well maintained and orders for structural steel are easier to obtain.   There are encouraging signs of greater activity in some shipyards.     Export markets are dull.On the Worth East Ooast the outlook is encouraging, espeoially in oonstructirnalengineering.     The export trade is also shewing some expansion.m F5 -*
In Sheffield operations are still being maintained at a high level.   The demand for billets, steel strip and bright drawn bars Is aotive and good business is being done In wire rods and stainless sheets.   There has been some expansion in the export market and there are indioations of orders from Russia.In South Wales    sheet and tinplate bars are in good demand.   The tinplate trade is quiet but is settling down to the working of the new international agreement.   The galvanised sheet market remains disappointing.ENGINEERING *   Enquiries as to new business have been increasingly numerous and output has been steadily maintainedo The expansion of activity has not caused any appreciable reduotion In the unemployment figures In recent months but the general tone is one of optimism.     Export business in railway material has been quiet, but recently substantial orders for rolling stock and looomotives have been received. Textile engineering generally shows little Improvement, though manufacturers of rayon spinning machinery are obtaining a Bteady flow of orders.       Shipbuilders will be busy for some months fitting out ships that were orderefi early in the year, but unless substantial new business is forthcoming the volume of work in hand will begin to diminish.MOTOR TRADE.     Home sales for the year ended 30th September are expected to show an lnorease of at least 20?o over 1933.     The rising percentage in sales of cars over 20 h.p. is significant and the Increased import of cars during 1934 has a direct bearing on this aspeot of the position.   In the foreign trade, the tendency towards restriction oontinues and the latest blow Is the application of a quota system by Norway.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.   The usual seasonal Improvement has taken plaoe in the outlery trade and export trade is slightly better.   Manufacturers of soissors and Bafety razor
blao.es pre working at full pressure.     The small tool and needle trades are well employed, hut seasonal slackness is being felt in fishing tackle.     The foundry inuustry should experience steady business up to Christmas.     There is little change as regards the lock, enamel hollow-ware and metal small ware traues. Architectural metal work continues dull, but conditions remain good in press work.      In non-ferrous metals the mills generally are working full-time with a steady demand.      The copper market remains depressed under the influence of conditions in America and Germany.      Zinc and lead prices are low.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      During September 1,142 million units of electricity were produced as compared with 1,023 million the year before.     For the first nine   months of 1934 the increase in production over last year amounts to 16..1$.Orders for heavy plant rose sharply in the home trade and export orders continued to advance.     Home orders for light material increased appreciably in September and exports showed a considerable advance over last year.COTTON.     There was some decrease in the number of unemployed spinning operatives during the month which was reflected in the weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners, which increased from 41,000 bales in August to 44,500 bales in September.     This increased activity is probably largely seasonal.     There was little change in prices of raw cotton.Spinners generally were able to maintain their margins and it apnears likely that the new agreement in the coarse yarn section will be. extended to the Egyptian and ring spinning sections.
There v/es some increase in unemployment in the weaving section.     An agreement has been reached in this section on the new basis of wage payment.There was little improvement during the month in general business conditions.      Orders from India and the Far &quot;]ost, except Hong Kong, have been difficult to obtain.      Demand elsewhere has also been poor, except for some seasonal buying for the Dominions and a fairly steady oemanu from South America.     As compared with August exports of yarns declined., only Inaia of the five chief markets taking a larger volume.     Exports of piece goods were, however, larger both as compared with August and with September,  1933.      Exports to India were nearly 10 m, sq, yds. higher than in August and there was some improvement in South Africa, Canada, British West Africa and the British West Indies.     Most European markets and Central and South America as a whole show little change, but the position in North Africa was unsatisfactory.WOOL.    There v/as little improvement in the general activity of the industry during September,  though there was some decrease in unemployment.     Raw wool prices continue to sag and this fall v/as reflected in the prices of tops and yarns which are now 20^ and 13%, respectively, below the level of a year ago.Exports of tissues declined as compared with August (9.31 m.sq.yds; as against 11.59 m. sq. yds).     T)here v/as, however, a slight increase in the exports of tops and yarns.At the moment there is a little improvement in the woollen and worsted sections which is mainly seasonal, but business, both on home and export account, continues to be scarce and there seems little hope of any material improvement in the near future.
3C* 0SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK INDUSTRY.    The sudden reduction in the duties on silk&apos; and artificial silk in early July caused considerable capital losses to holders of stock, but the removal of the uncertainty which existed for so long will have a stabilising influence in all sections of the trade. Meanwhile opinion is divided on the question whether it is desirable to remove the remaining excise duty on artificial silk.The production of artificial silk yarn in July was high. The output in August fell off, but probably only temporarily. In real silk Japanese competition remains serious in spite of the new duty position.     The exports    of artificial Bilk tissues should be materially helped by the Colonial quotas,chemicals.     In the alkali and heavy chemical seotion trade remained at about the same level as In the preceding-month.     There was again a decrease in the sales of dyestuffs at home as compared with a year ago, but with an increase in experts, production remained at much the same level.    The prices of ooal tar products have on the whole been maintained, while the market remains good for most wood distillation products.   The pharmaceutical   market is moderately active.SOAP,  OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.      Both the soap and margarine trade showed the usual seasonal recovery but the volume of business is still less than a year ago.   Business in edible oils and fats was well maintained.   The recent improvement in raw material production has aooelerate du prices of feeding stuffs have been still further advanced.PAPER .    The seasonal decline which was more marked this year continued in September.     The demand was better sustained in the. case of fine papers and boards than in other grades, though In these definite signs of improvement were appear?ng towards the end of the month.     Imports, except of strawboards were unusually high for September.   Exports, exoept of fine papers, show a substantial reduotlon as compared with a year ago.
37 during September the Sulphite Pulp Convention abandoned fixed prices although continuing to enforce restriction on output.     So far little movement in the price of sulphite pulp has occurred.BUILDING.      Industrial and commercial building still remains affected by the general economic conditions of trade and industry.      Some expansion is taking place In building work undertaken by public authorities.      In the case of ordinary house building it appears that approach is being made to saturation point in building for sale, except in the case of the cheapest types.     This must continue unless the market is stimulated by a further decline in the rate of interest or in costs.     The slum clearance schemes of the Government and Local Authorities are not yet in full operation, and as Authorities become more and more active demand in this connection should increase.CEMSKT. For the period January - August, 1934, exports in quantity show an increase of 12 per cent, as compared with a year ago.RETAIL TRADE.     The value of retail sales in August was 4.8;- greater than in August 1933,      This increase is larger than in any month this year and indicates substantial progress. The  improvement was experienced in all areas, Scotland and Suburban London showing the largest increases in food departments, and the Jest End and Suburban London In non-food departments.    Prelhninary figures for September seem to show that the  improvement is being maintained.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE. The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks to 8th September showed an Increase of 8-,95&apos; as compared with the corresponding period last year. The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed a decrease of 2.95$ as compared with a year ago and retail prices have increased by 0.01$ on the same basis.
SHIPPING.   The alight improvement shown in rates of freight in August continued In September.   The Index number of shipping freights for September was 88638 (1913 * 100) as oompared with 86.62 in July and 70.73 in September of last year. The preliminary estimate of the amount of tonnage laid up at ports in Great Britain and Ireland on October 1st is 820,000 net tons, as compared with 1,042,000 net tons at the 1st July last.   The reduction is due partly to a further reduction In total tonnage and   -partly to Blightly increased employmentsThe amount of tonnage under construction on the 30th September was 604,000 gross tons as against 587,000 tons at the end of June and 304,000 tons a year ago.     The amount of tonnage commenced in the September quarter was 77,000 tons as against 147,000 tons in the June quarter.EMPIRE.CANADIAN TRADE.     The general economic situation improved further in AuguBt.    Owing to the gain in farm products, wholesale prioes reached their highest point sinoe May, 1931. The index of business operations rose to the second highest level for the year.    Copper, zino and nickel exports, lead production and bauxite Imports showed marked Increases , The milling and sugar industries were more active, but meat packing showed a decline.   Rubber imports fell sharply but Imports of raw materials by the textile industry were larger. The output of newsprint inoreased, but exports of wood pulp and of planks and boards declined somewhat.   The Iron and steel Industry was not so active as in July.AUSTRALIAN TRADE - Total imports during August amounted to  8.7 m.  (Australian currency), being  2.6 m. more than a year ago.    Of the 426,000 bales of wool received into store slnoe 1st July only 7,400 have been sold or shipped.   The corresponding figures a year ago were 56,600 out of 465,000.   Butter exports sinoe 1st July amount to 10,600 tons against 8,100 a year ago. Wheat and flour shipments slnoe July 1st have reaohed the equivalent of 75.9 m. Tjushels of wheat.
