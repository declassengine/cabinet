THE SAAR.QUESTION OF SENDING BRITISH TROOPS.Note, Jby the Pro me Minister.1.      In accordance with the Cabinet Conclusions recorded at a meeting of the Cabinet held on &quot;Wednesday, 28th November,  1934 , a meeting was held between the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for far at 12, Noon, on Monday? 3rd December,  in order to make recommendations to the Prime Minister,  the Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the action recommended in connection with the possibility that we might be asked to con-tribute to an international force for the purpose of keeping order in the Saar in connection with the forthcoming Plebiscite. 2*       As a result of these discussions the following conclusions were reacheds-(a) that if the Council of the League should decide,  as a result of the information laid before them,  that it was desirable for an international force to be stationed in the Saar for the purpose of maintaining order in connection with the forthcoming plebiscite, and Great Britain was invited to co-operate in this matter,  then,  provided other countries were prepared to make a contribution, v/e should also be prepared to lend assistance on the express condition that both France and Germany agreed to this arrangement?(b) that if such an offer should emanate from the League, great importance is attached to making the composition of any such force as International in     character as possible,  and that besides contingents from Italy and Great Britain, it was desirable  that contingents should &quot;be made available from Belgium and Holland,  and also from Switzerland,  if this country was prepared to make the necessary special arrangements;(c) that the actual method of handling this question at Geneva should be left to the discretion of the Lord Privy Seal,who will be in telephonic touch with the Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs.   It is under-S&apos;.;;ood that the probable procedure will be for Mr. Eden to   gi^e information to the French and Italian represent-stives at Geneva on the lines indicated in conclusions va)   and (b)  above, on Wednesday morning,  5th December, ana   r-hat he would follow this up with a statement  to tte Council on Wednesday afternoon.-^Cabinet 43(34)  Conclusion 3. -1-
(d) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should arrange to give information,on the lines of conclusions (a) and (To) above, to the German and Italian Ambassadors, the actual date of these interviews to be left to his discretion in the light of information which the Lord Privy Seal may be able to send from Geneva.(e) That the question of the most suitable time at which to inform the Dominions,  should the proposal to send a British contingent to the Saar materialise, should be agreed between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(f) That consideration will have to be given at Geneva as to the payment of the expenses of any inter-national force which it may be decided to send to the Saar.Attention is also drawn to the following points whichwere taken into consideration in arriving at the aboverecorded conclusions.(i)    If, as a result of the information laid before the Council, it is decided that it will be necessary to constitute an intemiaticnal force for the purpose of keeping law and order in the Saar, in connection with the forthcoming plebiscite,  such a force should be sent to the Saar before the plebiscite, on the grounds that prevention is better than cure and that the international force should not include troops of either of the parties concerned.(ii)    We    could not in any circumstances undertake tc send a force to the Saar single-handed, although the strength of the force which we send must be sufficient to look after itself. Further,  that in settling the composition of the international force, if it is decided that the creation of such a force is necessary, careful handling will be necessary to avoid the possibility of Russia volunteering to send a contingent.(iii)    We could not in any circumstances undertake to send a force unless both Germany and France agreed to the proposal.     The assent of Germany is essential because, technically speaking, the Saar territory is still under her sovereignty and France&apos;s assent is equally vital because, without it, we could not &quot;send or maintain any force in Saar territory.In the event of a decision being taken to send a British force to the Saar, it is understood that the
necessary troops can &quot;be made available within six days.It is pointed out, however, that certain matters willhave to be organised in advance.(i)    Proper arrangements must he made for barracks.(ii)    The Saar must be divided into districts and suitably allotted between the inter-national force.(iii)    A Commander of the international force must be appointed, which we should greatly prefer should be a British Officer.(iv)    Adequate arrangements will be required for hospital accommodation and for the evacuation of any sick.(Intld. )    J.R.M.S, Whitehall Gardens, S.V/.1. 3rd December,   1934.
