DM. to traffic    IN   ARMS.PCSSIB1 LITY^JDP FORMULATING TERIPS OF REFERENCE FOR &quot;AN ENQUIRY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I had a long talk with the Solicitor-General about this, end as a result he has written me the annexed letter which contains a. most ingenious suggestion.      The effect cf the suggestion is that the necessary limits to the enquiry, to exclude a fishing investigation into rumours and scandals in isolated cases which would have no end,  could be secured by using the form of a letter (addressed,  I suppose,  to the Chairman of the Enquiry) which, while defining the matters to be investigated, would sty that the possibility of private manufacturers of arms bringing pressure or using improper means is obvious and is indeed the basis of the proposal for the abolition of private manufacture,  and that the Committee of Enquiry would therefore take into consideration the possibility of such abuses, but that it would not be within their terms of reference to investigate the truth of allegations that such abuses have occurred or to search for evidence of them.If my colleagues think that this method of setting up en enquiry would be satisfactory,I should bo luite pre pared, in the forthcoming debate on the Address, to indicate our willingness to set it up.       I should propose to recall theCP. 263(34).COPY NO.
statement I made in the lest debate that we should have no objection to an investigation into the proposal to set up a State monopoly and into the adequacy of our existing machinery of control, if such an investigation were desired; but that we should not be prepared to facilitate a fishing investigation into particular allegations connected with the system of private manufacture, since the possibility of such abuses is obvious and the only question of real importance is whether State monopoly provides a practical solution.      I would add that in the view of the Government it does not, but that we should make available for the Committee the reasons for this view through the evidence of responsible officials, and the Committee would also be able to take advantage of proposals or comments from other responsible quarters,  so that the whole problem could be investigated and reported on.(Into . )      d .3.16th November,  1934.
ROYAL COURTS OR JUSTICE, LONDON.16 th November,  1934.Dear Simon,I am writing to-day to send you certain ideas that have occurred Co me for what they are worth, and if anytning more that I think might be of use occurs to me during the week-end I will write again.&apos;   As a matter of drafting I can see no objection to the limitation which the Cabinet desire being expressly imposed upon the Committee.    To make the point clear I set out the following form of reference.    I do not suggest that my wording on the technical side of the matter is of any particular value.      To clear my own mind I thought it better to  see how it would look as a whole.&quot;You are desired to consider the proposalto abolish the private manufacture of arms withparticular reference to the points set out below.The possibility of private manufacturers of armsbringing pressure or using improper means whichmay result in stimulating demands for armamentseither in the country in which the manufacturers are situated or abroad is obvious.    The possibility ofsuch obup.es is indeed the basis of the proposal forits abolition,  the practicability and desirabilityof which you are being asked to consider.    You will therefore take into consideration the possibilityof    abuses of this kind.    It will, however, not be within your terms of reference to investigate the truth of general or particular allegations thatsuch abuses have occurred.
You are required in particular to consider:-(l)    The effect of the abolition of the private manufacture of arms in relation to national security including the question of expansion during war,  the actual or potential industrial organisations in other countries and the relative cost and efficiency of a State monopoly as compared with the present system in this country.(2) To consider the effect of the establishment of a State monopoly for the manufacture of arms on disarmament.(3)    To consider the existing system of licensing and control in this country.(4)    To consider generally the question of thecontrol of the trade in and export of arms on an. international basis with reference (a) to the effect of the possible establishment of State monopolies in ail countries and (b)  to the effect of a  system of control as a remedy for the abuses which may arise from the continuance of the private manufactux-e. &quot;I had a word with the Attorney, and as a matter of drafting   he saw no objection to the express limitation on the Committee from investigating charges though he has not seen the above suggestion as a whole.    I feel there must be a good many cases whex^e Committees have proceeded on the basis of the possibility of abuse without having had to admit evidence which might be interminable as to individual cases one way or the other. There may however be objections to this course, and what may be desired are terms of reference which without putting on any such express limitation would make it irrelevant to the subject matter of the inquiry.    So far as this is concerned I should have thought that the special points (l) and (2) above would or might be in this category.    I had in mind under paragraph (2) the point, which is difficult to set out too plainly,  as to the political pressure that might be brought&apos; to bear on a Government not to increase unemployment by the direct
act of turning off men from State factories.      With regard, to (3), and (4)  it would I should have thought be impossible to consider these matters without considering abuses and that if nothing was said on the point the Committee would consider themselves entitled if not bound to hear evidence as to abuses.    It seems to me that the inquiry would be to a large extent unreal if the Committee -were not entitled to take the q\iestion of abuses into account.    If this is so, then unless they are expressly told that they may do so and expressly forbidden to receive evidence as to particular instances they would be entitled to take such evidence. I am very conscious that my wording of points (3) and (4) is inadequate, but I put them in so that you can see the impression I have got, rightly or wrongly, of the general scope of the inquiry that you had in mind.    It may be that you would propose asking the Committee to consider the League Committee&apos;s proposal of this year, in which case the terms cf reference would be of course different.      I had wondered whether that Committee took evidence as to actual cases of abuse.    If not, it would afford a good precedent.    I feel rather strongly myself that  if I were asked to inquire into this matter3 the possibility of abuses and their undoubted existence in certain cases is so obvious that evidence on the point which would almost certainly be unsatisfactory and incomplete would immensely delay and enlarge the scope of the inquiry without adding anything in the least useful.    One might for example get no evidence of actual bribery which has I  should think obviously occurred and the possibility of which in certain countries ought to be borne in mind.(Signed) DONALD SOMERVSLL. -5-
