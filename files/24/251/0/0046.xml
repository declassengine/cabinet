At their&apos; Meeting on the 29th October,  1954,  (Cabinet 57 (54) Conclusion 1) the Cabinet agreed-(a) That a Cabinet Committee should be appointed to examine and. report upon the Draft Regulations of the Unemployment Assistance board(b) That the composition of the Committee should be settled by the Prime Minister and should follow the lines of the composition of the Unemployment Insurance policy Committee of the Cabinet.The composition of the Committee was settled as followss-The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Minister of labour.The First Commissioner of works,The Postmaster General.The Committee have examined the Draft Regulations of theUnemployment Assistance Board.     A copy of the Regulations isattached (see Appendix).2.      The Draft Regulations   have been prepared by the Unemployment Assistance Board in accordance with Section 38(5)  of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934, and-
submitted to the Minister of Labour under Section 52(2) of the Act.      They are designed to govern the assessment of need of applicants for allowances under the Unemployment Assistance Scheme which, it is intended, to be brought initially into operation on 7th January, 1935, subject to the approval by parliament of these Regulations, to be expressed by affirmative Resolutions of both Rouses.5.      The Regulations provide for one scale of allowances for the whole country, the figures of which are subject to adjustment in individual cases to meet variations in rent and, at the discretion of the Beard, special circumstances.      The scale is set out in Regulation IV.      It is to be noted that the figures shown therein do net represent the sums allocated to particular members of the household.      They are the figures upon which the needs of the household as a whole are to be assessed according to the numbers and the ages of the various members.      These figures are subject to the deductions in the case of large households mentioned in paragraph 9 of this Report.4.      The adjustment for rent is an important feature of the Scheme.      The scale of allowances for households of two or more persons assumes a basic rent of 7/6d. per week (including rates) where the appropriate scale allowance for the whole household is from 24/- to 30/- inclusive, and a basic rent of one-quarter of such allowance where it exceeds 30/-.     Where the actual rent paid exceeds the basic rent, the allowance for the applicant and his dependants is increased by the amount of the excess, subject to a maximum increase equal to one-third of the basic rent in the particular case except where special discretion is exercised to increase it.     Where the actual rent paid by the household is loss than the basic rent, the allowance is reduced pro tanto, subject to the important qualification that, to meet special circumstances as explained in paragraph 10 of this Report, the amount of such reduction may be decreased by an amount not exceeding l/6d.
-    2775.       When the scale allowance has been adjusted according to rent,  the figure arrived, at is described as the &quot;provisional assessment.&quot;    The&quot;final assessment&quot; is arrived at after computing the available resources of the household in the manner provided in Regulation V.6.        Regulation V,  sub-paragraphs 1 and 2,  reproduce certain provisions from the Unemployment Assistance Act, whereby a pro-portion of income from sickness and maternity benefit, disability pension, workmen&apos;s compensation, and savings, must be disregarded. Further, in accordance with the requirement of the Act that due regard shall be had to the &quot;personal requirement&quot; of those members cf the household whose resources are taken Into account, Regulation V, sub-paragraph 3(1), lays down rules as to the treat-ment of earnings by members of the household according to relationship, and Regulation V, sub-para^raph 3(3), deals with the treatment cf other resources such as benefit received under contributory insurance schemes,  including unemployment insurance and contributory pensions, blind pensions, widows&apos;  pensions,  etc.7. Regulation VI(1) prevents assistance in ordinary cases inexcess of wages.      By Regulation VI(2), the Board is given an overriding discretion to adjust the final assessment, upwards or downwards, to meet special circumstances.      Regulation VI(3) will enable the Board, to meet any needs of an exceptional character which must occasionally arise in an unemployed household e.g.  lack of clothes or household equipment.8. The Committee were informed by the Minister of Labour thatthe estimates supplied by the Beard indicated that the broad effect of the Regulations would be to add a substantial sum to the total amounts now being expended by way of transitional pay-ments and out relief to the able-bodied unemployed.    The regulate-ions would, moreover,  bring to an end the present anomalies resulting from the widely differing standards adopted by local authorities in the administration of transitional
payments, and. would substitute for the present public assistance arrangements a scheme entirely free from poor law taint.9.      Our attention was specially directed to the increased children&apos;s allowances payable under the Regulations.    This feature of the Regulations will, we feel,  secure a wide measure of approval.      In this connection we have given careful consideration to the operation of the proviso requiring deductions to be made in the case of large households.      We are satisfied that this proviso is justified on the ground that the initial allowance contains provision for overheads such as fuel, lighting,  etc.,  the cost of which does not increase proportionately with the size of the family.10.    We have   also had to examine in detail the probable effect ofthe rent rule having regard to  the wide variation in rents indifferent parts of the country.      It is anticipated that the board will have to exercise  their discretion widely to deal with areasof exceptionally high rent as, for example, London.      In rural areas where rents are low the operation of the rent rale will automatically reduce the assessments to a considerable extent.This may not, however, by itself suffice to produce the correctlevel of assessment in those areas and it may be necessary forthe Board to use its discretion to effect any further reductionthat may be required.      In order to deal with transitional paymentcases in low rented industrial areas the Board will have discret-ion in such cases to decrease any reduction due to the rent rule,up to an amount of 1/6d. per week as stated in paragraph 4 above..We are satisfied that this will obviate any substantial hardship whichmight otherwise arise, and will help to guard against any abruptchange in the standard of living of recipients of transitional payments.11.      The Committee make the following recommendation to the G - b ine t: -That,  subject to the reservation set out below, the Regulations,  submitted by the Unemployment Assistance Board and annexed hereto, should be approved for presentation to Parliament under Section 52 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934.
The reservation above referred to is as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer has reserved for further examination the ouestion of the extra cost to the Exchequer resulting from the operation of the Regulations, and will report thereon to the Cabinet .Signed on behalf of the Committee,N.
