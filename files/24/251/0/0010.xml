INTER-DEPAR&apos;? &quot;E^ITAT.. COMMITTEE ON TRADING IN ARMS.REPORT.1.      The Ministerial Committee on Disarmament, at its meeting held on October 23rd,  1934,  recorded the following conclusion;-&quot;(a)   That an Inter-departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, With representatives of the Foreign Office, Dominions Office, Board of Trade, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry,  should be set up with the following terms   of referenceTo prepare, for the consideration of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament, a Draft Convention dealing with the control and supervision of the trace in and manufacture of arms such as we could put forward as a self-contained proposal for international adoption,&quot;2.      In accordance with these instructions, we have held two meetings on Thursday, October 25th, and Monday, October 29th.      In addition to those Departments mentioned in the terms of reference,  the India Office were invited and arranged to send a representative to the meetings since it was considered there were certain matters in Which that Department might have an interest.      We have also consulted Sir William Malkin,  the Foreign Office legal adviser,  in regard to particular points on which we felt his guidance was necessary.3.      The draft of a Convention which might be suitable to be put forward as a self-contained proposal for inter-national   adoption is included as Appendix I to this Report.      In framing this draft Convention we have-1-
endeavoured as far as possible to follow the lines of the draft articles put forward at Geneva by the Committee for the Reguxation of the Trade in and Private and State Manufacture of Arms and Implements of war (vide Appendix IT).      We realised that  there would oe ever,- advantage in submitting a draft which should diverge as little as possible from one which had already been the subject of discussion at Geneva and had received some measure of&apos; agreement.      Indeed, the Geneva draft gives effect to certain principles upon which Hit Majesty&apos;s Government have in the past insisted in negotiations on this subject. Thus the Geneva draft px&apos;ovides for a national (as opposed to an international)  system of licensing;    for  the establishment of a national system of export and import licences;    and for equality of treatment for State and private manufacture.    In one or two important respects, however, we have departed from the Geneva draft, and the reasons which have lead us to adopt this attitude are explained in the succeeding paragraphs.4. There is one important addition which we have madeto the Draft Convention, which has never yet been put for-ward internationally (Article G, Appendix l).    For some time we have been,-perhaps, the only country&apos;in the world having an Export Credits Scheme which did not afford help to its private armaments industry by means of this Scheme.  It is not unfair to say that our policy has handicapped our private manufacturers in. competition with private manufacturers in other countries who have been granted facilities which we have felt unable to grant to our own firms.    It is there-fore suggested that it would be to the interest, not only of
our own industry but also of the international control of the traffic in arms, if it were possible to secure the adoption by other countries of the same policy v/ith regard to export credits as we ourselves have adopted for some years past.     The practice of foreign Governments in-granting export credits to their private manufacturers enables the latter to supply armaments on a credit basis very often spread cut over a number of years.     The abolition of such a practice would serve not only to reduce unfair competition5 but to bring to an end a system which enables armaments to be supplied to countries which might in other circumstances not be in a position to purchase them. 5, Certain articles in the Geneva draft were insertedon the assumption that there would be a Disarmament Conventionj of which the group of articles dealing with the trade in and manufacture of arms would form an integral part.      Such articles are obviously inappropriate to a self-contained instrument such as we have in view, and have been omitted.      At the same time there will have to be some body at Geneva responsible for receiving and checking the information to be furnished by Governments under the provisions of the proposed Convention on the Trade in and Manufacture of Arms.     We have j, following the example of the Geneva draft, suggested sted that the Permament Disarmament Commission would he an appropriate body for this purpose5 if it should be decided to bring it into existence. Otherwise some other body would have to be -appointed or designated for this purpose.     We have omitted the Geneva proposal for a system of permanent   and automatic inspection, as His Majesty&apos;s Government only agreed to consider this as part of a Convention providing for limitation or reduction of armaments.
4 76. The Geneva draft required that licences to manufacture should give a description of the imolements of war the manufacture of which is authorised, and that the description should cover not only finished articles but also component parts.        We understand that there are some 2 - 3,000 firms manufacturing component parts, and to issue licences to ail these firms would be a formidable   task.      In addition, the detailed licensing of the products of these firms might have the effect of forcing them out of business,  since the profits which they muse are not large enough to compensate for the additional inconvenience arid labour which such a system would involve.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have already decided thatlicences  should be &quot;limited substantially to the finishedproduct&quot;.      Me have, therefore, omitted in the draft the reference to component parts in Articles E and F of the geneva draft.      We recognise, however, that this limitation opens a door to the evasion of the Convention,and that for this reason it is to be expected that therewill be strong pressure by some delegations at Geneva in favour of the extension of licensing to cover component parts.      We return to this question later in paragraph14.8. The most substantial change which we have made inthe Geneva Draft  is in Article F (Article E in Appendix l) which enumerates the various classes of information which High Contracting Parties will forward to the permanent Disarmament Commission for publication by the Commission. This is, more especially from a political point of view, an    important    Article   in    the   Geneva   Draft, &quot;in  ! that    it    embodies   the   provisions/
for the publicity to be given to the operations both of manufacture of and traffic in arras.9-       The Geneva Article provides in the first place for the communication to the permanent  Disarmament Commission of a list of all state establishments engaged in the manufacture of arms;     and for the communication to the Commission of copies of all licences to manufac-ture, within a stated number of clays of their being-issued.      We have maintained these two provisions without substantial change.10.      The Geneva Article further provides for the communication to the Permanent Disarmament Commission of (1)  a list of orders within a given number of days of their receipt whether by State or by private establish-ments;    (2)  copies of all import or export licences a given number of days before the articles covered by them enter or leave the territory concerned, and (5) an annual statement of all manufactures, imports and exports effected.11.      We have found it necessary to propose some con-siderable modification in these previsions in order to conform to the previous policy of his Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.      If lists of orders for arms are to be communicated, these lists might he expected to give either the value, or the numbers, or both the value and the numbers, of the articles to which they relate.      Manufacturing firms would have serious objections  to the disclosure of the prices charged for their products.      Moreover, the disclosure    of    the   number    of    articles   covered   by each   order   for   manufacture   would,    over    a   period of.    time,    reveal      the     extent      of     the     reserves of   material   held   by   the    armed   forces    of    the
country concerned.     His Majesty? s Government have in the past always opposed on the grounds of national security the disclosure of information as to the extent of their reserves of material.      Unless, therefore,  the policy cf His Majesty1s Government in this matter is to be reversed, it will be necessary to delete the provision in the Geneva draft relating to the communication of lists of orders.    There would not, from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment be the same objection to the communication of copies of all import and export licences, but it may be taken as certain that if there is to be no detailed publicity as regards orders and manufacture, non-manufacturing countries will object to detailed publicity as regards their imports of arms::      The omission of the provision dealing with orders will,  therefore, logically entail the deletion of the provision dealing with import and export licences.12. The solution which we have suggested is designedto avoir! the difficulties to wh1.eh we have referred above, while at the same time providing for some degree of publicity.      In place of the annual return of manufacturers, import s and exports which the Geneva Draft prescribes, we have suggested a quarterly return of arms manufactured, imported and exported.        This return will be in greater detail, than the annual state-merit    in    the   Geneva    Draft.        It    will show    separately the    total   value,    although   not   the   number,    of the    arms   manufactured    or    imported    or   exported,
under each of the categories in which arms and implements of war will be classed by later provisions of the Convention for purposes of definition.    In the case of imports and exhorts;, the return will also shew the countries of origin and destination.      The draft which we propose, which will be found in Article h (c)  of our text,  is thus of on intermediate character,  standing somewhere between the provisions of Article F (c) and (d) of the Geneva Draft on the one hand, and Article P (e) on the other.It has, however, been pointed out by the representatives of the Admiralty that the problem of financial publicity, so far as manufacture for the State is  concerned, has been carefully con-sidered at Geneva, ana that an agreed report has been adopted. The proposed new return, in so far as it concerns manufacture, could not bo collated with or related to the system of publicity already elaborated.    In some respects it could only be approxi-mate, and many countries might be unable, for technical reasons, to give it at all.13.    Pe hove net overlooked that the Leag\ie of Potions publishes a periodical statistical return, cased on information made public by various governments in respect of their exports of arms, and that these statistics disclose both the value and toe numbers of the arms exported, though this information is very much out of date.        It might be contended, therefore, that so far as exports are conceited our  proposals fall short in the matter of publicity of the already estaoiished practice..      This is so,  but His majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto declined to extend to manufactures - for themselves, such a degree of publicity as is now given to exports to other countries.
14. There has been insufficient time to draw upcategories in definite terms nor does the Geneva proposal contain any definitions for them;   it   merely states that existing categories should be reviewed.      In the circurn-stances we submit, tentatively5 a proposal for categories taken from a portion of the Report of the Sub-Committee at Geneva in 1933.      Service Departments and the Board of Trade consider that any licences to manufacture should be limited to the finished article and are therefore opposed to the inclusion of component parts in the categories (see paragraph 7).15. We have not included in our draft any separateprovisions for application in special 2ones, as was done in Chapter III of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1.925.      It was observed by the representatives of the Admiralty thai, although the 1925 Convention is not in force, yet the Articles dealing with special zones give a kind of authority for the action&apos; which the Admiralty normally take for the suppression of the illicit traffic in those sones.      They therefore suggested that the conclusion of a new convention which omitted to make provision fox1 special zones might weaken their position.      It was agreed, however, that to propose the inclusion of provisions for special zones in the new con-vention would arouse strong opposition, particularly from the Persian Government, and that there was not sufficient ground for introducing this unnecessary complication.16.&apos;        The question arises whether any special provision is required in order to exempt from the operation of the Convention, both as regards licensing and publicity -
(a) Arms, etc. , consigned for the use of the forces of a High Contracting Party wherever situated (e.g. , in the case of the United Kingdom arms for naval forces of the United Kingdom or for the use of United Kingdom forces in Egypt, Iraq, etc.).(h) Arms consigned from the territory of one Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations to the territory of another Member. A.S regards (a) provision was made in the 1925 Convention to exempt such arms by Article 52, and it has been thought desirable to include a similar article in the present draft.      It is net, however, proposed to exclude such arms, etc. , from the returns relative to manufacture.As regards (b), having regard tc the fact that the effect of the present draft convention is to provide for publicity by value for all arms, etc. , manufactured in, as well as exported from, or imported to, the territory of a High Contracting Party it would seem to be difficult to contend that the value by categories of exports from, e.g. , the United Kingdom to a Dominion should be excluded from the publicity provided for in the draft, even iu cases where the arms are supplied by the United Kingdom Government to the Dominion Government.      It would be by no means easy to draft an article which would have the effect of excluding such transactions in a form which would be acceptable to all his Majesty&apos;s Governments, and in any case it seems very doubtful whether foreign Governments would be prepared to agree to such exclusion.prom the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom there would seem to be no special reason for claiming exclusion for consignments between the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India.
3, Whitehall Gardens, S-W-l-, 29th October, 1954.If any Dominion Government should raise the question of the exclusion of such consignments, further consideration v/ould have to be given to the question in the light of the difficulties mentioned above.17. The 1925 Convention contained an article (No.  56)under which any High Contracting Party had the right to exclude all or any of his Colonies, etc., from the opera-tion of the Convention.      We do not consider that such an article could be inserted in the present Convention, since it would enable any High Contracting Party largely to defeat the purposes of the Convention by encouraging the establishment of munition factories in an excluded Colony.18. We assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldnot agree to undertake the obligations of this Conven-xion unless those obligations were also undertaken by all the important manufacturing countries.      It will be necessary to introduce a general article to this effect.(Signed)    ANTHONY EDEN,Chairman, On behalf of the Committee.
