3J*)(THIS DOCUMBI NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEPJIMLNT),SECRET. 4^ CP.  276 (54).COPY NOC A B I NET.CIVIL AIR DBFENCE SERVICES.Proposed transfer of cost from Army Votes to Civil Votes.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I have been approached by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for War with a view to the transfer from Army Votes to Civil Votes of the cost of the Civil Air Defence Services.    The expenditure in question includes the cost of certain work carried out by the Chemical Defence Research Department and, in the last two years, the salaries of the Air Raid Commandant and his Staff Officer.on -army Votes largely because it could not be transferred elsewhere without attracting public attention, which it was desired to avoid.    It has now, however, been decided that the existence of measures for the protection of the public in the event of air attack ought no longer to be kept secret, and a statement on the subject was included in the speech of the Lord President of the Council on the 30th July.    It was settled as far back as 1924 that the control of these services should be vested departmentally in the Home Office, and it is the ordinary and salutary rule that the department which has the main responsibility for controlling a particular head of expenditure shall account for that expenditure to Parliament.This expenditure has hitherto remained as. a charge
I accordingly propose to agree to the requestof my two colleagues, and to arrange that this expenditure shall, beginning with the next financial year, do borne on a special subhead or subheads of the Home Office Vote. In view, however, of the political considerations involved, I consider&apos; that Cabinet authority should be obtained.(Intld.)   N.treasury Chambers,  S-29th November, 1954.
