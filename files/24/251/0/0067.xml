December 1934.3nSECRET.Copy No.CP. 292 (34).CABINET.THE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF AND TRADING IN ARMS.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. I WAS asked to make some suggestions as to this (Cabinet 41. Conclusion 6, of the 21st November), and I will do my best, though, as I have already pointed out, I do not regard this matter as primarily a matter for the Foreign Office. It appears to me to concern the Board of Trade and the Defence Departments much more than the Foreign Office, and I made the announcement of the enquiry with great qualms as to whether a suitable formula could be devised and whether the outcome would be of public or political advantage.2. The terms of reference which I suggest for consideration are as follows : (1) To consider and report upon the practicability and desirability (both from the national and international point of view) of the adoption (a) by the United Kingdom alone, (b) by the United Kingdom in conjunction with the other countries of the world, of a prohibition of private manufacture of and trade in arms and munitions of war, and the institution of a State monopoly of such manufacture and trade.(2) To consider and report whether, assuming that private manufacture and trade continue, there are any steps which could usefully be taken to minimize the grave objections to which such manufacture is stated in Article 8 (5) of the Covenant of the League of Nations to be open; [for this purpose, the existence of possible abuses is assumed, and it will not therefore be within the terms of reference to investigate particular allegations].(3) To examine the present arrangements in force in the United Kingdom relative to the control of the export trade in arms and munitions of war, and to report (a) whether these arrangements require revision, and, if so, in what directions; (b) on the extent to which the general adoption by other countries of similar arrangements might be expected to eliminate or reduce the objections referred to in paragraph 2.3. The passage in square brackets at the end of sub-paragraph (2) would, I think, make it certain that the enquiry did not turn itself into a roving commission; it may perhaps be considered safe to leave the chairman to rule that it follows from the earlier part of sub-paragraph (2) that no such roving enquiry is within the terms of inference.   But there is a risk.4. The phrase &quot; arms and munitions of war &quot; is itself ambiguous, e.g., does it cover warships? Does it cover any aircraft? It would be possible to draw up terms of reference to make this quite clear, one way or the other, but I am inclined to think that it is better to leave the phrase vague so that the enquiry may, amongst other things, deal wuth the difficulty of drawing the line, especially in the case of aircraft.[10881]
5. As regards the kind of body which is to be entrusted with this enquiry, I see great difficulty in nominating anything less elaborate than a Royal Commission. A Tribunal under the Tribunal of Enquiry Evidence Act, 1921, would require a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. An interdepartmental committee would not satisfy the public demand and has no power to send for persons and papers. A Parliamentary committee would seem to me most unsuitable inevitably you would get members who represented different points of view and were to a large extent bound to maintain them. The warrant appointing a Royal Commission may give power to send for persons and papers. This would meet the criticism that the investigation proposed could not be -sufficiently thorough, though, as it is not desired that the body should investigate particular allegations or conduct an investigation into the private papers of armament firms, I should not have thought that any sending for persons and papers would be required. The Chairman of such a Royal Commission, if he was a good man, would begin by a private meeting in which he and his colleagues decided, in outline the course of procedure they would follow and the sort of information they would want. For example, they would want to hear evidence from the departments principally concerned. They would also at some stage be prepared to hear serious witnesses who had a scheme to propose. e.g., Colonel Carnegie, and it may be Professor Gilbert Murray. They would, I imagine, be pressed to hear Lord Cecil, and it would be an advantage to hear his view of any difficulties. A Royal Commission need not sit in public, though it usually does so except when for reasons of State a private sitting is necessary.6. As regards personnel, in view of the fact that the Lord Chancellor considers the chairmanship of a Law Lord or English Judge impossible. Lord Londonderry^ suggestion of the Right Honourable James Andrews. Lord Justice of Appeal for Northern Ireland since 1921, for Chairman seems the best. A letter sent to the press by Lord Cecil and half a dozen others strongly presses for a &quot; judicial &quot; enquiry, and this would be a good way of satisfying that demand.  I know nothing personally of the Lord Justice&apos;s qualities or personality.7. For the rest, I really cannot dp more than mention a few names which have occurred to me, for what they may be worth. The object ought to be to secure a small body of people who are really impartial and uncommitted. Lord Plender, Sir Horace Rumbold or Sir Malcolm Robertson or Sir Francis Lindley, Miss Violet Markham, Mr. J. A. Spender, Dr. Scott Lidgett, the Bishop of Pontefract. This last I can recommend strongly, not because I know his views on this subject, but because he is a man of good sense and courage who certainly will not subscribe to a view because it finds favour in any particular circle. I do not know if it will really be thought necessary to add a Trade Unionist; it would seem very desirable, if so, to find a man of independence of view who will not feel that he is only the spokesman for a larger body outside.8. It would, I suppose be enough to announce the terms of reference and the form of enquiry first, but I feel that this is a most undesirable course, if it can be avoided. For it will inevitably lead to every sort of pressure to include particular names. Could not Lord Justice Andrews be got to come over to London first in order that it might be ascertained confidentially whether he would undertake the task?J. S..
