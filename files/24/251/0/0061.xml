(P) 34.)CABINET.PROVISION FOR AIR RAIDS SERVICES.Report by the Air Raids Precautions  (Policy)  Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.1. THE Cabinet, at their meeting held on the 25th July. 1934 (Cabinet 30 (34)). gave approval for a statement to be made in the House of Commons in respect of Air Raids Services. An announcement was accordingly made by the Lord President of the Council on the 30th July. 1934, the second half of which read as follows : &quot; We feel, with regard to the protection of the civil population, that our plans have been carried as far as is possible without wider publicity than has hitherto been deemed to be in the public interest.The next stage involves communications with local authorities, with public utility companies, and so forth, and with all those on whom responsibility for action would fall in the emergency contemplated, and before long steps will be taken to communicate the necessary instructions to the general public.&quot;2. It had also been explained to the Cabinet that before long it would be necessary to consider the question of making provision for certain Air Raids Services, and that some expenditure would inevitably have to be incurred if schemes for the protection of the civil population were to be adequately completed.3. The question of the responsibility for financial provision has been the subject of careful examination, and we have come to the conclusion that, in respect of certain services, the responsibility ought to lie with the central Government. Not only do we feel that any attempt to place this responsibility on other shoulders would arouse great opposition, but it would, in our judgment, be manifestly unfair to expect certain districts which might find themselves subject to heavy air attacks to incur considerable expense, when other areas, more fortunately situated, would be put to no corresponding expense.4. The services in respect of which we think provision may have to be made, not all immediately, by the central Government, may be enumerated as follows :  (i) A dministration.The direction of Air Raids Services by the central Government will involve certain administrative expenses.(ii) Provision of Respirators.It will be necessary to build up a reserve of respirators for personnel engaged in essential Air Raids Services. If such a reserve is not built up in time of peace it will be impossible to make the necessary provision when it[10826]Copy No.
is required in time of emergency. The question of the provision of respirators for the general public does not arise at this stage, as the problem of designing a cheap respirator for this purpose has not yet been solved.(iii) Protective Clothing. .   . - .;It will be necessary to accumulate a supply of protective clothing for certain personnel engaged on essential Air Raids Services.(iv) Research.Research work in connection with Air Raids Services is carried out by the Chemical Defence Research Department. The expenses of this Department are at present borne by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry in an agreed proportion. In view of the considerable amount of work which passive air defence is placing on this Department, it is felt only equitable that a portion of its expenses should be found from any grant which may be authorised in respect of Air Raids Services.(v) Bleach Powder.It will be necessary to accumulate reserve stocks of Bleach Powder for use in decontamination services.(vi) Medical and Surgical Supplies.It will be necessary to arrange for certain essential medical and surgical supplies to be available directly the emergency occurs. Such supplies cannot be met from reserves held normally in time of peace, and it is essential, therefore, that any existing deficiencies should be made good and the necessary reserves accumulated.(vii) Training.It is contemplated that, in due course, exercises must be carried out in order to familiarise the general public in the different parts of the country with the arrangements proposed by the Government.(viii) Experiments.Certain experiments of great importance are required, in particular, experiments to determine the penetrative effect of high explosive bombs a matter on which no information at present exists and the behaviour of gas in a confined area, e.g., in a street in a city. Until information on both these points is available, it will be impossible to give the necessary advice to the general public as to their behaviour in certain circumstances, and as to the protective measures which should be taken in advance.5. We have been in consultation with the Treasury on this matter, and it is suggested that there should be a new sub-head created in the Home Office Vote, especially for Air Raids Services.*6. Although the Lord President announced in the House of Commons on the 30th July that consultations would be taking place with the local authorities, and that instructions would be issued to the general public in the near future, we have not yet felt able to make any general move in this direction, partly for the reason that the question of the incidence of financial responsibility would immediately be raised, and it therefore seemed expedient to refrain from extending our consulta-tions until a decision on this fundamental question had been reached. We are anxious in the near future to enlist the co-operation of all local authorities, and others who may be concerned, lying within the possible danger zone of hostile air attack, and, in view of the fact that estimates for the forthcoming financial year are now in active preparation, we felt the time was suitable to submit our proposals to the Cabinet.7. For the expenditure to be incurred in tire next financial year, we estimate that the sum of approximately  100,000 will be required.   Without* Vide CP. 278 (34).
3.C4* CP. C4 (34).going into very specific details, we might explain that this sum is made up very approximately as follows :- Provision for respirators, mainly for training purposes       40.000 Research, being 10 per cent, of the cost of the Chemical &apos; Defence Research Department ... ... ...       15,000Administrative Services   ... ... ... ... 7,000Experiments in connection with the penetrative effect of high explosive bombs, the behaviour of gas in confined areas, and exercises for the public ...       30,0008. It will be observed that no provision is included in this estimate for protective clothing, bleach powder and medical supplies. As regards protective clothing, we have thought it advisable to await the result of certain important experiments now in hand before starting to accumulate reserve stocks. With regard to bleach powder, one of the main difficulties is that this substance deteriorates rapidly in storage, and measures now under consideration for the removal of this difficulty are not yet sufficiently advanced to enable us to make any concrete proposals. Finally, the extent of the provision to be made for medical and surgical supplies cannot yet be estimated with any precision, and we have therefore not felt justified in making any specific provision for this purpose in next year&apos;s estimate.9. After consideration of the question of making financial provision for shelters, we are disposed, in present circumstances, to think that if any local authorities are anxious to build shelters for their public, they should themselves bear the cost. At the same time, we realise that, for one reason or another, it might in the future be decided that the provision of such shelters was essential in the interests of national security. Should such a situation arise, we think that our present recommendation might have to be reconsidered and that the central Government might feel itself obliged to assist in this matter. For the time being, however, we do not recommend that any provision should be made and we would suggest that the question should be kept under review.10. Before summarising our recommendations, we should like to draw attention to paragraph 30 of the Report^ of the Defence Requirements Committee, in which reference was made to the importance of the protection of the civil population.   This paragraph read as follows : &apos;&apos; 30. Before leaving the deficiencies to meet the German menace, we feel bound to make a brief reference to the question of Air Raids Precautions. These precautions should be developed pari passu with the anti-aircraft defences. They will require an expenditure which we are not at present able to compute, but which we believe will be very small compared with the totals contemplated in this Report. We suggest that the Home Office should be asked to draw up an estimate, in consultation, if they think fit, with the Air Raids Precautions Sub-Committee. We would observe, also, that the incentive to the German Air Force to deliver attacks will be increased if they are aware that, unlike the peoples of Continental countries, the British population has no knowledge or warning of the precautions to be observed for the purpose of reducing casualties. They will count on panic as a powerful ally. We are aware of the reasons which have deterred the . Government from full publicity in the matter of Air Raids Precautions, but we would urge that whenever a new defence programme is launched the opportunity should be taken to remove the ban against full publicity that is preventing us from obtaining full benefit from the years of effort that have been devoted to this matter.&quot;The Defence Requirements Committee recommended that the deficiencies in the Defence Services should, if possible, be made good over a period of five years. The Cabinet, on financial grounds, decided to spread out these deficiencies over a longer period although, in respect of the air, the major programme will be completed within the five-year limit.    We would suggest that it is very
important that the measures for the protection of the civil population should proceed pan passu with the active defence measures against air attack which the Government have authorised, and we recommend, therefore, that our preparations should, so far as possible, be completed within five years.11. It will be within the recollection of the Cabinet that the&apos; programme of making good deficiencies in the Defence Services is to be kept under constant review, and is to be subject to variation in either direction in the light of international circumstances. We think the same principle should apply to the arrangements for the protection of the civil population.12.   Our recommendations may be summarised as follows : (i) That a new sub-head should be created in the Home Office Vote in respect of Air Raids Precautions Services, and that a sum not exceeding  100,000 should be included in this Vote in respect of the forthcoming financial year 1935-36, the composition of this Vote to be as described in paragraphs 7 and 8. (ii) That, so far as can be foreseen, the actual Services to be financed out of the expenditure in the first year will be : (a) Central Government Administrative Services.(b) An accumulation of reserves of respirators for personnel concernedin the operation of essential Air Raids Services; the question of a decision on the wider issue of the supply of respirators to the general public to be deferred pending the results of certain experiments now being conducted.(c) A contribution, on an agreed percentage basis, to the maintenanceof the Chemical Defence Research Department.(d) Provision   for  certain  essential  experimental  work  and  fortraining.(iii) That sums in respect of the following Services may need to be providedfor in future years : (a) The provision for certain medical and surgical requirements.(b) The provision of stocks of bleach powder.(c) The provision of reserves of protective clothing for personnelengaged on essential Air Raids Services.(iv) That it is not recommended that any provision should be made in presentcircumstances for public shelters, though this is a matter which may require reconsideration in certain circumstances, (v) That the provision of Air Raids Services should proceed pari passu with the Governments programme for the expansion of the Air Force; that is to say, it should be spread out over a period of five years, and should be subject to the same conditions as are attached to the Air Force expansion programme, i.e., the situation should be kept constantly under review, and any provision suggested may be subject to variation in either direction in the light of the international situation.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :JOHN GILMOUR,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, December 3, 1934.o
