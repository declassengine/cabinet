TS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )F^8lJ.34l. G0?Y NO,   frfrC A B I NET.tim COi\HvlITTEB OP INQUIRY INT 0 THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURE 61&apos; AND&apos;TRALTNG IN ARMS. &apos;Memorg.iidu.id by the Lord Chancellor.There are two objections, either of which appears to me to he fatal, to the employment of a Judge to preside over the Committee of Inquiry into the Private Manufacture of and. Trading in Arms.1&apos;    The increased delay in the discharge of judicial business which must result from the detachment of a Judge.As what I said upon the occasion when this matter was last discussed does not appear to have convinced all my colleagues, I must recur to the matter in greater detail.The amount of injury which would be caused by the loss of a Juage, though in any case serious, differs according to the Court from which the Judge is taken.To begin with the highest Court, that is to say, the House of Lords in its judicial capacity and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which, for this purpose, may be considered together, since membership of the two Tribunals is largely common.      Two members of the Judicial Committee -Sir Lancelot Sanderson and Sir Shadi Lai - are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords.      I apprehend that, eminent as are the services which these gentlemen have rendered in the pas&quot;t in India upon the Bench and at present render at the Judicial Committee,  it -would not be suggested that either should be chosen for the peculiarly delicate matter   now in contemplation.
There then remain seven Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who, with the two already mentioned and such scanty help as can occasionally be obtained from volunteers who have held high judicial office, have to man the two Tribunals. In order that the two Tribunals should keep abreast of their work, it is desirable that,  during the greater part of the judicial year, the House of Lores should be in judicial session ana the Judicial Committee should sit in two Divisions. As it is usually necessary that the House of Lords as a judicial assembly should be composed of five peers, it is obviously impossible that this desirable end should be achieved. It is also obvious that if the number is reduced to six Lords cf Apr)eal with the two Indian members,  it is not possible to maintain both the Tribunals in full operation.      It is not a question, in the case of these Courts, cf some arrears having been accumulated so that it matters but little if there is a slight increase in them.      These Courts must be kept ab-solutely abreast of their work.      They always have been so in the past, and, if they are once suffered to fall Into arrear, no expedient could redress the balance.      It happens that the present is a peculiarly critical time in the history of the two Tribunals.      Opinion in several of the Dominions is agitated on the question whether the right of appeal to the King in Council should be retained in their case;     there happens to be an unusually long list of appeals to the House of Lords;    and some of these appeals happen to be unusually long,       Furthermore, in so small a body as one consisting of seven persons,  the dislocation which must result from the withdrawal of any one of them is great,, and it would be greater than appears at first sight,  since, though all these persons are of great legal eminence,  they are not all equally adaptable for particular types of work, ana it appears possible-o
that if the choice were made from among them, it would fall on someone whose absence would he peculiarly damaging.I turn now to the Court of Appeal.      It would technically be easier to detach a member of that Court for this pur-pose, since his place could be filled &quot;by temporarily calling up one of the Judges of the High Court. The result of doing so would be to cause delay in the work either of the King&apos;s Bench or of the Chancery Division as the case may he,      I will point out the serious consequences which will  ensue   at a later stage of this Memorandum.      For the moment it is enough to say that, even if this incon-venience be disregarded, I could not with confidence select a member of the Court of Appeal who could he spared from his duties and who unites in himself the peculiar combination of qualities which are necessary for this matter.I turn now to the three Divisions of the High Court.      In the first place I exclude the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division because, apart from any other ground, one of the three Judges of that Division is seriously ill, and the other two have the greatest difficulty in disposing of the work which they have to discharge.      Neither the Divorce work nor the Admiralty work of this Division can be allowed to fall into arrear.      Such a misfortune has hitherto been averted &quot;by very strenuous exertions..      If those exertions were to prove insufficient for the purpose, either very great hardship would be entailed on the suitors in the Divorce Court, whose cases peculiarly need prompt despatch,  or the Admiralty work, which already lias a tendency to drift elsewhere, would be lost to the Courts with very grave consequences, not only to the litigants, hut to national prestige.
As regards the Chancery Division,  there has hitherto been no arrear, hut, owing to a peculiar combina-tion of circumstances, grave fears are entertained with regard to the work there.      The organisation of the Division has recently been remodelled and the work proceeds smoothly.     But the withdrawal of any one Judge would jeopardise the situation.As to the King&apos;s bench Division, I have on frequent occasions during last year brought to the attention of my colleagues the very serious state of affairs there and the loud demand from among the public for greater expedition.        We are actually proposing to introduce a Bill to add to the judicial strength of the Divison in order to overtake arrears.      I v/ould suggest that we cannot v/ith consistency at the same time withdraw a Judge of that Division from his proper duties either to supply the place of a member of the Court of Appeal detached for non-judicial work,  or himself to undertake the Inquiry. But beyond this, I could not recommend my colleagues    to appoint any Judge of the King&apos;s Bench Division to the posi tion.2. The disastrous effects on the judicial officeof the employment of a Judge for non-judicial purposes.My second ground of objection proceeds not on expediency hut on principle.      The matters to which the Inquiry relates arouse loud controversy in the country.      It is for that reason that it is proposed to institute the Inquiry. We are all familiar with the kind of difficulty with which the president of the tribunal undertaking the Inquiry will he faced.      He will be compelled,  if he fulfils    the part
for which we destine him, ruthlessly to exclude many matters which those holding certain views will desire to elucidate.      His action in doing so will he the subject of fierce criticism.      ^t would be suggested that he is acting on the suggestion of His Majesty&apos;s Government and is being employed to cover transactions which we are unwilling to bring out in the full light of day.      Such an allegation may be entirely unfounded.      But it will none the less he made and will reflect upon him,  if he is a Judge, in his judicial capacity.      It appears to me in the present state of our history to be above all imperative that the detachment of the college of Judges and of every individual one of them from political controversy should he maintained.      There has been in late years too great a tendency to negliect this principle.      I regard it as of the highest importance that nothing should be done to trench upon it.As I am extremely anxious to assist my colleagues in this matter,  I proceed to make some constructive suggestions.      I understand that what is required in the Chairman of the Inquiry is a familiarity with legal pro-ceeding, a knowledge of the laws of evidence, and the courage to  take a firm line.      These qualities may he found united in many lawyers who do not sit upon the Judicial Bench.      I would recommend those whose names I now proceed to mention as possessing them in a high degree.Sir John Fischer Williams^ C.B.E., K.d.  after a distinguis       academic career, at the close of which he became a Fellow of New College, Oxford, acquired a substantial practice as a Junior at the Chancery Bar.      When the War began, being over age for military service, he worked in the
QOtro o j home Office until, after the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, he was appointed Legal Adviser to the British Reparations Delegation.      He is an excellent lawyer and a man of firm character, and,  since his work on the Reparations Commission came to an end, has had considerable experience in the conduct of international arbitrations between various continental nations.      He is at present Chairman of the Commission on Tithe,Among practising lawyers,  I would recommend either Mr, Wilfrid Greene,  K. C , or Mr,,  Gavin Simondg, K, C, , of the Chancery Bar,      They are probably both well known by reputation to my colleagues,      I need only say of them that I should be happy if I might induce either of them to accept a Judge ship,      Among Common lawyers,   the choice is more restricted by the fact that practically all the well known leaders of the Common Law Bar either are in Parliament or have well known political affiliations.      I would, however, suggest the name of Sir Harold Morris, K,C., who was at one time for a short period National Liberal Member for East Bristol, but who for the last eight years has occupied the position of President of the Industrial Court,(intld,)    S,House of Lords,30th November,  1934
