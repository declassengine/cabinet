Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.      I should be glad to have the authority of the cabinet for the introduction into Parliament at an early date, andsubject to time permitting, of a Bill to amend the Diseases of animals Acts for two main purposes -(l)    to mafce provision for the application of the Acts to poultry;    and(2)    to provide for the regulation of the manufacture, sale, and importation of vaccines, sera, and other therapeutic substances intended to be used for veterinary purposes.PART2.     At present there are no statutory powers whatever to enable the Ministry of Agriculture or local authorities to deal administratively with poultry diseases in this country, or to prevent the introduction of disease from abroad;    the growth of the industry, and the intensive methods of conducting it which are now common, render it desirable that the Ministry should have power e.g., to stop movement of fowls from a farm on which such a disease as Fowl Plague or Newcastle Disease has appeared, and to slaughter diseased or suspected birds where it is judged necessary.      If IS true that highly infectious and fatal diseases such as the two I have mentioned do not often appear hero;    but we have no security that there might not be a serious outbreak et any moment, and if one did occur, I feel that we should be open to serious criticism for not having applied to Parliament for the necessary powers to enable us to deal with it.
3.     Numerous representations have been made to the Ministry to the above effect by agricultural bodies and local authorities;    and the question of the Ministry obtaining the requisite powers has been discussed with the Council of A agriculutre, the Poultry Advisory Committee,  the National Farmers1 Union, and the County Councils Association.       All interests agree that the desired powers should be obtained.4.     It is not anticipated that any appreciable additional expenditure v/ould be involved in the normal administration. It is impossible to give any estimate of the expenditure which would be required by way of compensation if it became necessary to deal by slaughter with a widespread outbreak of one of the deadly virus diseases already mentioned:    it would depenl entirely on the magnitude and character of the outbreak.     But the expenditure would only be large if the outbreak were so serious as really to threaten the welfare of the industry. It is intended that compensation should be paid only where the poultry slaughtered shows no sign of the disease. PART II.5.     The other main purpose of the Bill proposed is to empower the Ministry of Agriculture to regulate the manufacture, sale, and importation of therapeutic substances intended solely for veterinary purposes.      Such substances are at present excluded from the operation of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1925, by regulations made under that Act. The Ministry of Agriculture has consulted with the Ministry of wealth, and both Departments are agreed that powers should be conferred upon the former Department to deal with biological products intended exclusively for veterinary purposes.6.     It has been increasingly ,evident for some years that the conditions under whioh substances such as tuberculin, vaccines, and sera may be sold in Great Britain for veterinary
purposes are unsatisfactory;    and representations have been made to the Ministry of Agriculture by agricultural bodies for some time, urging that steps should be taken to control the manufacture and sale of such products, and in particular tuberculin.     This last subject was considered by the Cattle Dioeasec Committee of the Economic Advisory Council, who recommended in their .:eport of last April that the Ministry should approve a standard for tuberculin of prescribed potency and purity;    and the Bill will enable the Minister to prescribe and enforce such a standard.      This measure iB highly desirable for the efficacy and reputation of the tuberculin test, on which any oampaign against tuberculosis in dairy cattle must at present depend.7.     It is proposed to deal by a system of licensing based on inspection with any substances in regard to v/hich the minister may decide to exercise the powers to be conferred by the Bill.8,      It is not expected that the administrative work under this Part oi the Bill will require any addition to the Ministry&apos;s staff.     The total cost is estimated to be in the region of  350 a year.9.     In addition to the two main purposes stated above, it is proposed to take the opportunity of the Bill to regularise the position of the Ministry in certain minor matters, namely, the maintenance of quarantine stations for the examination of animals before export, and the treatment of animals with serum or vaccine.10.     The greater part of the Bill will extend only to Great Britain;    but Nortern Ireland has asked that it may be included in the part relating to veterinary therapeutic substances.     This question is now under discussion with tho Home Office.11.      Illie proposals to be included in the Bill appear to be entirely non-contentious.\K    CP    TJ1 li .
