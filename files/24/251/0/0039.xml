COPY NO, Q   1CAP I NET,MOSSING rOLICY COMMITTEE*FINAL REPORT.In their First Report (CP. 46 (34)) the Committee submitted inter alia the following recommendations to the cabinet-(a) That;  subject as stated in (b) below, general approval in principle should, be given to the various Housing Policy proposals set out inthe Minister of Health&apos;s Memorandum (CP. IS (34)).(b) That as regards &quot;overcrowding and redevelopment&quot; the offer of financial assistance from the Exchequer should be strictly limited to cases where the rehousing is effected on or near the central site by means of blocks of flats and should not be given in cases where the rehousing is effected by means of ordinary small houses erected on undeveloped land on the outskirts of the area of the local authority,(c) That as regards Scotland it should be recognised, that some modification in the Minister of Health&apos;s proposals will be necessary to meet the special housing circumstances in that country.(f)    That after the conclusion of the discussions with the local authorities the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should prepare and circulate to the Committee (which should be kept in being for the purpose) detailed final proposals with a view to the Committee submitting a report thereon to the Cabinet,At their Meeting on the 81st February, 1934,  (Cabinet 6 (34)Conclusion 5) the Cabinet had before them the above recommendations and agreed-(a) To approve the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee as summarised above(b) That the Bill arising out of these recommendations should, not be introduced before the August Recess.(d) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be a member of the Housing Policy Committee.
At their Meeting on the 31st July, 1934,  (Cabinet 31 (34) Conclusion 4) the Cabinet approved the following modification of recommendation (b) of the First Report of the Cabinet CommitteeThat no general subsidy will be given for cottage building.That in the special cases referred to, it will be open to the authority in respect of a particular scheme, to produce evidence that, for such reasons as those stated, a subsidy is necessary *      It would then be for the Minister to decide, subject to Treasury approval as to conditions, whether trie claim had been made out or not, and to allow subsidy if necessary, subject to a reasonable maximum and to a rate contribution.On the 9th November, 1934, the Minister of Health submittedto the Committee a Memorandum covering the draft Housing Bill(lb  (34) 5) and on the 20th November a further Memorandumcovering a supplementary clause on compensation and a revisedclause relating to Loans by the Public works Loans Beard(H.  (34) 6).We have carefully considered the draft Bill In the light of the explanations given by the Minister of Health.      At our Meeting on Tuesday, 20th November, it was agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should, as a matter of urgency, make a verbal report to the Cabinet at their Meeting on the 21st November, and should propose that the Minister of Health be authorised to submit the Bill direct to the Home Affairs Committe on the 26Mi November.,      The Cabinet approved this proposal (Cabinet 41 (34)  Conclusion  8 ) and the Bill has now been submitted to that Committee under cover of a short explanatory Memorandum (IMA. 50 (34)).      The attention of the Cabinet is drawn to this Memorandum which sets out concisely the main features of the Bill.
We are satisfied from our examination of the Bill that it gives effect to the general principles already discussed and approved By the Cabinet at their meetings referred to above.      We have, however, felt it necessary to give special consideration to two- aspects of the Bill, and we desire to draw the particular attention of the Cabinet to them.The first of these is concerned with the political implications of the proposads of theMinister of Health.      Putting aside for the moment all questionsof compensation, we feel that the Bill is likely to create agood impression in the country solely in proportion to itsactualsuccess  in accelerating the/Touilding on a large scale of flatsand houses appropriate to the needs of the wage-earning classes-.The important clauses providing a standard by which to measureovercrowding, though highly valuable in themselves, are motor widespreadlikely to make a strong/public appeal, and might even bring unpopularity on the Government if it were thought that legal pro-ceedings might be taken at an early date against the tenants or the owners of dwellings where overcrowding exists.The fixing of the Appointed Day, after which over-crowding becomes    under certain conditions   an offence,  will under the Bill be entirely within the discretion of the Minister of Health, and he has explained that it is not his intention to fix the date until a period of at least twelve months after the passing of the measure,  i.e.,  not earlier than, say, June,  1936.      Even then, few prosecutions,  if any, are likely to take place in the next few months,,      We attach considerable importance to this point having regard to the political issues involved,
With regard to the acceleration of house building, asuggestion has been mace that a provision should be inserted inthe Bill, giving an assurance to local authorities that, ifthey accelerate the building of flats and houses on account ofschemes to be submitted under the Bill, they will not lose theprovided thatsubsidy in respect thereof,   Z the flats or houses comply withthe conditions prescribed in the Bill.     We understand that aprovision to give effect to this proposal is now in course of drafting, and we recommend its adoption by the Cabinet.Cabinet&apos;sThe other point to which the/attention   is particularlydirected   is that of compensation in respect of housesccmpulsorily acquired under slum clearance schemes.     Theproposals in the Bill are that the present state of the law inthis respect should be ameliorated, in favour of landlordsin three cases where at present it appears to press undulyharshly upon them. These are as follows:-    (1) theabolition of the reduction factor,  i.e. the requirement imposedupon an arbitrator to base his award of compensation on theonlyvalue of the land for housing purposes/, other possible uses ofthe land being ignored;  (2) the abolition of the rule underwhich a house fit for habitation, but condemned merely by reasonof its situation in relation to other houses not fit forthe basis ofhabitation,qualifies    for compensation cn/site value only; under the Bill market value will be applicable in such a case,? and (3) the establishment of a distinction between good, landlords who have endeavoured to keep their properties in repair, as distinct from those who have neglected to do this;    under the Bill the former would receive a payment or   solatium    in addition to compensation on the site value basis.In the view of the Minister of Health these substantial concessions should go far to meeting the agitation which now exists to ameliorate the law relating to the compensation for properties compulsorily acquired under slum
clearance schemes.     V/e fully endorse the proposals contained in the Bill on this subject5    hut the Minister has drawn our attention to the fact that pressure during the passage of the Bill through Parliament is likely to he exercised on Behalf of other categories of landlords, in particular shop keepers and owner occupiers.      Considerable pressure may also be directed towards altering the present procedure under which awards of compensation are made in the talaat instance by the Minister himself and not by an independent tribunal.     lie concur in the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health that these further claims should, be firmly resisted..     At the same time we are impressed with the fact that the agitation on these points may prove to be considerable. V/e submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet:-(a) That, subject as stated in (b) below, approval should be given to theHousing Bill submitted by the Minister of Health in the form of the draft attached to his Memorandum (K.  (34) o), together with the amendments set out in the Minister&apos;s further Memorandum (H.  (34) 6).(b) That a provision should be added to assure local authorities that, if they accelerate the building of flats and houses on account of schemes to be submitted under the Bill, they will not lose the subsidy in respect thereof, provided that the flats or houses comply with the conditions prescribed in the Bill.(c) That the attention of the Cabinet should particularly be drawn to the fact that the Minister of Health proposes to fix the Appointed Day, for the purposes of offences under the overcrowding clauses of the Bill, at least one year after the passage of the Bill into law, and that he does not anticipate that prosecutionswould ordinarily take place for a further period after the Appointed Dap&apos;.(d) That attention shouldalso     be drawn to the fact that considerable pressure may be expected during the passage of the Bill through Parliament to extend the concessions proposed in the Bill and alter the procedure in relation to compensation.     The Committee concurs, however, in the view of the Minister that such pressure should be resisted.
(e)    That the recommendations above should not prejudice the consideration of any special modifications necessary for the adaptation o f the s c he me to   S c o 11and.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeN.C,CHAIRMAN,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. November 22nd, 1934.
