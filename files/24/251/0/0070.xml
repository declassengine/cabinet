LfCOMMITTEE ON GERMAN RE-ARM AMENREPORT .1.     A further meeting of the Ministerial Committee on German Re-armament was held at 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, December 11th, in order to consider what recommendations could be made to the Cabinet as to the next step to be taken in respect of the question of German re-armament. We feel that it is of the utmost importance, now that the House of Commons Debate of Wednesday, November 28th,  is successfully over, that a decision should be taken on this fundamental question of policy and that the action which we propose to take should be announced as soon as this policy is decided.2. As a result of our discussions we put forward the following recommendations to the Cabinet:-(a)That an approach should be made to Prance at the earliest possible moment.      This approach should take the form of an invitation to M. Flandin to visit this country and to hold discussions v/ith us.(b)    That we should not, at the present stage,have any detailed discussions.with the Italians, though the Italian Government should be informed of our invitation to M. Flandin and the general tenor of the matters which it is proposed to discuss.      Great importance is, however, attached ultimately to agreement between France, Italy and the United Kingdom in dealing with this question.(cc)    That in the discussions with M. Flandin, the actual method of approach must be elastic and the sequence in which the various matters are developed, can. best be decided in the light of circumstances at the time.      The following points, however, are considered of first importance in these negotiations:-
(i)   An attempt must be made to get theFrench Government to face the actual facts and,particularly, that it would appear impracticable to expect Germany to scrap what she is in process of building up in regard to armaments, in order that a fresh start might be made in a new agreement.(ii)    It is considered that the situationvis-a-vis Germany must be taken as it is to-day, and that the principal and first objective is to persuade Germany again to return to her membership of the League of Nations.(iii)    In developing the question of Germany&apos;s return to the League, we should put forward our view that, while we do not in any way oondone Germany&apos;s action in leaving the League, v/e can conceive of no real basis for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe so long as Germany remains outside.(iv)    The point should be made that we are fully convinced of the illegality of Germany&apos;s re-armament but it is considered to have reached the stage when its recognition has become inevitable and to press strongly the point that it is far better that this re-armament should be controlled than that it should remain uncontrolled.(v)    If the French Government should raise the point that Germany has, in fast, succeeded by a policy of blackmail, v/e should, not perhaps dissent but v/e should ask France what are the alternatives.(vi)    Germany will eertainly demand equality of rights and may conceivably not be content with the idea of the status quo.     We should recognise nothing to begin with beyond what has been done, but in negotiating the Convention Germany should be in the same position as the others in upholding what figures she thinks she requires to be inserted in the Schedule.      If, for example,  it was considered that the figures inserted by Germany would be likely to menace our security or the security of France, then we should strongly challenge them, but if it should be possible to get an agreed schedule, then this schedule would, in fact, be itself a guarantee of security because the Powers concerned would be satisfied that none of the figures accepted for any other country were a menace to their security.
(vii)   A particular point to &quot;be made is that it is not proposed to legalise what Germany has done, hut rather to recognise the fact of her re-armament up to date; hut there should be no question, at present, of recognising any further developments before and until the whole matter is negotiated at Geneva.(viii)    If a Convention can be negotiated atGeneva on the lines suggested above, it is on the clear understanding that it will only replace those clauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles which are directly affected.   This would mean, for example, that the clause dealing with the Demilitarised Zones would not be matters for discussion.(.ix)      The possibility must always be faced that Germany will not be prepared to accept the suggestions put forward.     This would be serious, but not more serious than the present situation developed as Germany means to develop it0(x)       That if, during the course of the negotiations Prance should raise rights under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, it could be pointed out that while it would appear extremely unlikely that this Article would ever be enforced, it might be possibles by international agreements to arrange for a system of inspection to which Germany herself has not objected, provided it is of general application to all countries,,3,     We have outlined above, in very general terms, the method of approach to this very difficult problem which seems to us to offer the best prospects of success at the moment. We realise that there is always a risk that Germany may   free herself from the restrictions of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles and that no bargaining with her may be possible, and, in consequence, no general agreement.     Such a situation would be very-serious, but there does not appear to be any alternative.      If the situation is just left to drift, Germany
will continue to re-arm to whatever degree she may ultimately desire.     She may break   all her agreements by unilateral action? and we shall have lost in the end all chance of ever getting control of her actions? a control which? in our opinion? is essential for the security and peace of Europe.A^     There are further matters which we have still to discuss? and on which reports will be rendered to the Cabinet as necessary.      In the meantime? there is attached to this Report, for information, a copy of a Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs which has formed the basis for our present considerations.Signed, on behalf of the Committee?

(34) 3.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON GERMAN RE-ARMAMENT.Note by Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairslNOW that the House of Commons&apos; debate of Wednesday, the 28th November, is successfully over, we are left face to face with a fundamental question of policy which will compel us both to act, and to announce our action, very shortly in accordance with the way in which the question is decided. It is therefore very necessary to face the question and decide it in our own minds without delay. Temporising methods will not help us at all, and, indeed, a failure to come to grips with the problem now will very quickly lose for the Government the improved position resulting from Wednesday&apos;s debate, and will, in the end. fasten upon us a well-founded charge that the direction of our foreign policy in this respect is not clear and definite.2. The question is that which I formulated in Cabinet some weeks ago, viz. : (a) Are we prepared to contemplate the legalisation of German armaments ?and(b) If we are not prepared to do so, what is our line going to be when germany either demands their legalisation or announces that she has armed in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, and intends to continue to disregard the Treaty ?To this might be added (c) If we are prepared to legalise German re-armament, what are we to say to the French and when and how are we to say it ?3. The communication by Sir Eric Phipps to the German Government of the substance of the statements made -by us in the House of Commons about German re-armament last Wednesday and the German answer to our Ambassador have created a position in which Germany, in effect, admits our allegation. At any rate, the only figure which Herr von Neurath showed himself prepared to challenge was the figure of 1,000 aeroplanes, and in consequence of this challenge and of the advice of our Air Attache, we modified our statement so as to avoid a denial. Controversy between us and Germany as to the facts would do no good, and one of the principal merits of our recent communication and announce-ment is that it clears the air. It is possible that Germany may very shortly affirm positively that she has these arms I understand that the German military authorities had already told certain visiting British officers that they were glad that the period of concealment was nearly at an end and that everything would be laid bare in February. Now, if we may treat our public allegations of German re-armament as established or admitted facts, it follows that it is 7079   [10845]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1934.
publicly avowed that Germany has broken, and is breaking, Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. I consider that one of the advantages of having communicated at the same time with France as to what v/e were about to announce is that this fact must also now be treated as between France and ourselves as officially recognised. This may raise new difficulties with the French, but it is a definite gain to have moved away from the unreality created by pretending or imagining that the Treaty of Versailles could, in this respect, be made d restraining influence on Germany.4. We may, I think, anticipate that the first concern of the German Government will be to get the Saar question settled. They will not want to hurry a possibly acrimonious discussion about re-armament until the Saar question is over. This gives us a little time, but none too much. It will be a very grave mistake if we postpone considering the really big problem set out above on the ground that we first want to see how the Saar question works out. Far better, if we can, to get some ideas formulated and thoroughly discussed now with a view to provisional agreement as to what our policy will have to be, even though that policy must be provisional and may have to be revised later on. Once the Saar question is disposed of, the German Government will wish to discuss the terms on which the signatories of the Versailles Treaty will legalise Germany&apos;s re-armament by cancelling Part V of the Treaty, or at any rate the Disarmament Clauses thereof. No doubt the idea would be that, in order to save everybody*s face, such an arrangement should be embodied in a so-called &quot; Disarmament Convention.&quot; I submit that we should proceed amongst ourselves on the assump-tion that the German Government intend at the moment most suitable to them-selves to present a formal demand for legalisation. Since that demand, when put forward, cannot be resisted by force and will therefore be followed (either by agreement or by unilateral disregard of the Treaty) by the continuance and. it may be, the aggravation of the situation we have publicly announced, I suggest that it would be desirable that we should keep control of the initiative instead of leaving it to the Germans.5. But it is not only the Germans who will very soon demand to know our view. We have informed the French, Italians, Belgians and Americans officially of our demarche in Berlin, and some of these Powers will make an even earlier enquiry of us. The French are already enquiring. It will probably be only a matter of days before we are asked by some of them what the result of our demarche has been. I see no reason wiry we should tell them of Herr Hitler&apos;s extravagant outburst, but we ought to be quite frank with them on the main subject, and this means that we must, as speedily as possible, know our own minds.6. Are we going to tell the French that we are in favour of initiating&apos; disarmament conversations with Germany in order to find out what terms we can still obtain from Germany in return for cancelling Part V of the Treaty ? If so, we must be prepared for strong resistance from the French Government, for there is nothing to show that they are at present educated up to the idea of legalisation. Indeed, Frenchmen appear to draw from the existence of a Treaty which is not being observed an amount of comfort and sustenance which are very difficult to understand. M. Herriot once said to me at Geneva that it might be that a ruffian meeting him in the street would take his watch from him by force, but that was no reason why he should give it to him. If we cannot persuade the French that legalisation is the inevitable outcome, and therefore should be anticipated now, are we prepared to go ahead on our own account and negotiate, or proclaim our willingness to negotiate, a cancellation of Part V with. Germany? Of course, it ought not to come to this, for Anglo-French disagree-ment is not only bad in itself, but it encourages Germany. We ought, I think, to make much of the growth of British opinion in favour of this course. From this point of view, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech the other night seemed to me extremely useful. I presume that in any conversations with the French and Germans we should (at any rate in the first instance) treat the German offer of the 16th April as still expressing their maximum requirements.7. On merits, what is the argument against this course other than the very formidable argument that it may produce a severe strain in Anglo-French relations? That, of course, would be an event of capital importance, and this single objection may be found to outweigh every other argument.   But the other
arguments seem to me to be strong. If the alternative to legalising German re-armament was to prevent it, there would be everything to be said for not legalising it. But the alternative to legalising it is for German re-armament to continue just the same, with the added complication that further increases are secret and that the sense of injustice and resentment continues to be stimulated. Abraham Lincoln declared at the beginning of the American Civil War that the baited States could not remain half slave and half free. And in the same way, the fact is that Europe cannot remain half bound and half free in the matter of armaments. The party that is bound has already burst his chains and nobody is going to put the shackles on him again. It is only when that party is conceded by the others the right to equality in the sense that we are either all free or all bound by agreed limitation, that any prospect of agreed limitations can arise. It may be said that if we take the positive step of giving Germany her release under Fart V (just as we have already given her release from reparations, from the occupation of the Rhineland and from exclusion from the League), this will only hasten the day when she will bring up the next point, e.g., territorial boundaries or German colonies. All these things will come in time no doubt, but I doubt whether we should really be hastening the pace by recognising the inevitable and getting such terms as we can while we recognise it. We followed the French for twelve years in holding on to reparations and no good came out of it. It is the case of the Sibylline Books.8. Another set of considerations which calls for very prompt analysis with a view to a decision is suggested by considering the line which the French Govern-ment may now take with us. We must be prepared for the French Government to take the line that, since the scales have at last fallen from the eyes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and since we now realise the menace of German re-arma-inent, we are assumed to be ready to allow our military and aeronautical experts to co-operate with those of France in drawing up a formal indictment which both countries can then present to the League under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles. This is, in fact, the course provided by the Treaty for dealing with the situation which has now admittedly arisen. Up till now the French have not actually urged it, for the same reasons that have prompted His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to remain silent about German re-armament as long as possible. We have -come to the conclusion that there is no advantage in remaining silent any longer, and, indeed, that there is an added danger in doing so. But now that the question has been officially placed on the table, and now that Germany has officially confessed that she is re-arming in violation of the Treaty, the French may argue that the only proper and legal course to adopt is to take the matter to the Council in the manner laid down in the Treaty.9. Are we prepared to agree to this course? The objections to it are obvious. It would lead to immediate deadlock; it would reveal afresh the impotence of the League of Nations; and it would practically force Germany into open repudiation and into the rousing of German opinion in a most dangerous fashion, for it is, of course, inconceivable that Germany would submit to a League investigation &quot; such as Article 213 envisages.10. Even supposing that the French realise this as clearly as we do and do not press the matter, we must be prepared for them to insist on our discussing with them some alternative procedure in its place, and I am afraid that any such discussions would bring us back on to the old ground of French security.11. This paper does not profess either to cover the ground or to put forward a conclusion. My object is to call the immediate attention of my colleagues to the overwhelming importance of facing these questions immediately. At the risk of formulating a provisional view without adequate consideration and without the advantage of full consultation with others, I tentatively advance the following-propositions :  (i) Apart from the enormous difficulty raised by its effect on Anglo-French relations, the best course would be to recognise that Germany&apos;s re-armament in breach of the Treaty is a fact which cannot be altered and to reach the conclusion that this had better be recognised without delay in the hope that we can still get, in return for legalisation, some valuable terms from Germany. Germany would prefer, it appears, to be &quot; made an honest woman &quot;; but if she is left too long to indulge
in illegitimate practices and to find by experience that she does not suffer for it, this laudable ambition may wear off.(ii) The main condition would be that Germany would return to Genevaboth for the Disarmament Conference and for League purposes. I do not think it would be possible to get Germany to return on the basis that she was still bound by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, but that release would come as soon as a new agreement was negotiated. Germany is certain, I consider, to require the release to take place concurrently with her return. Equality of rights will then be an established and admitted fact. It may be possible for us in the course of negotiations for bringing this about to get certain under-standings with Germany, e.g., the limit she will accept for her navy, but broadly speaking she will want to be free first and to negotiate afterwards.(iii) To all this the French will reply &quot; security.&quot;   (They will also protestthat wrongdoers and blackmailers should not be given the fruit of their wrongdoing, but all this must be rejected on the two grounds that British opinion will not stand for it and that the practical results of continuing to take this line are disastrous.) As to security&apos;, is it possible to get Germany to look more favourably on the Eastern Pact ? I doubt it, for Chancellor Hitler likes bilateral agreements on the model of the German-Polish Pact, but he suspects multilateral pacts. We might perhaps do what we could in discussion with Germany to get her to make this contribution as a way of reaching equality of rights, but if it fails, it looks as though the Franco-Russian agreement (which Herr Hitler asserts and Sir Eric Phipps denies), may be the form of security&apos; wdiich France will be left with, (iyj The grouping of other European Powers, if the above line were pursued with the French, is not difficult to imagine. It must, I think, be admitted that there would be a tendency to increase the division into different camps, and the difficulties and obstacles accumulate as one reflects. But what is the alternative ? I cannot think that British public opinion will remain satisfied with the futility of ignoring the fact that German armaments are in breach of the Treaty. Once that it is avowed that they are and admitted on all hands that this cannot be prevented, there will be an increasing demand to get rid of the lumber while it may still fetch a price. And the retribution if we do not adopt a definite policy in regard to this, whatever that policy should be, will be severe.J. S.Foreign Office, November 29, 1934.
