CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.  512..BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. State of Trade. November. 1954.Summary of Reports,submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented In some cases with statistical information fromother sources).Overseas Trade.     Imports in November were  64.7m. as compared with  63,7m. in the previous November.     Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures wsre  36.1m. against  34.4m. and re-exports  4.0m. against  3,6m. a year ago.     The excess of imports over exports for the 11 months up to 30th, November was  260.Om. and for the corresponding period last year  830.8m.Employment.       The employment position in November showed little change on the whole as compared with a month earlier.     The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 26th November was 2,120,785, an increaBO of 1,150 as compared with 22nd October.The main variations were:-London.......... + 7,810South Eastern... * 8,066South Western... + 3,277Midlands........ - 10,447North Eastern... - 10,752North Western... - 6,085Scotland....... + 8,483Wales........... - 202The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 26th November was 10,212,000.     This was 6,000 more than a month before and 262,000 more than a year earlier.Employment continued to improve in the cotton, wool, hosiory, boot and shoe, and motor vehicle industries.     There was a substantial reduction in the numbers temporarily stopped in the coal mining industry, and some improvement was also shown in shipbuilding and ship-repairing, doek and harbour services, and the distributive trades.
On the other hand there was a further reduction in employment in the &quot;building and allied industries, hat and cap manufacture, and the shipping and hotel and hoarding-house services.    Employment also declined in tailoring, dressmaking, the tinplate and pottery industries, and cocoa, chocolate, etc., manufacture.Railwayso    During the five weeks ended 2nd December railway traffic receipts increased by  193,000 (1,41%) over the corresponding period of 1933, the increase in passenger traffic being 2.0%; in coal and other fuel 1.0$ and in other freight traffic LOJo.   For the 48 weeks ended 2nd December, the total receipts amounted to  137,6m. against  132.4m. in the same period of 1933.Shipping, The index number of shipping freights (1913 a 100) for November was 83.68 as compared with 83.85 in October and 80.56 a year ago.Banking.    Money remained plentiful and foreign exchange rates were very steady.   As from 8th November the Clearing Banks reduced their minimum charge for money against Treasury bills and other bills accepted for discount by the Bank of England from 1$ to The minimum rate in respect of other classes of securities continued at lf*.     The Market was, therefore, able to sell bills at rates which were now a little more appropriate to the rate which it had to pay for borrowed money.   Nevertheless there was a fall in bill rates which varied between ^ and lf/j for 1934 bills and       and       for 1935 bills.    Treasury bills were allotted on the 2nd at 6/8d* per cent., on the 16th at 4/9d. per cent, (only a fraction of a penny over the low record of 22nd September 1933) and on the 30th at 9/4d,    The latter increase was natural with the approach of the end of the year.    Foreign exchange rates moved within very narrow limits and the price of gold was stable.    Early in the month, the franc was weak but the improvement in the political situation on the Continent in the third week caused
the tide, which had been running against the franc, to turn against sterling.Coal.     The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 24th November was 4,437,000 tons as compared with 4,160,000 tons in the same quarter of 1933, an increase of 7%* The average number of persons employed during this period was 765,600 as against 761,300 the year before.The home consumption of coal and coke in October was 11$ higher than in October 1933,     Exports in November at 3,317.-900 tons were 289,000 tons loss than a year earlier.     As oompared with last year, exports to most Scandinavian countries, except Denmark, were well maintained, and there was some lnorease in exports to Spain.     On the other hand there were decreases In exports to Germany, Belgium and France.An agreement has practically been concluded between the British and the Polish coal owners for regulating the distribution of coal in competitive export markets.      This marks a notable departure in voluntary international coal agreements.Iron and steel,.      The daily output of steel Ingots was nea.r3.y as high as in October and the situation was generally satisfactory with some prospect of a better demand from constructional engineers and shipbuilders.     Pig iron production was satisfactory and in the semi-finished market the volume of business tended to increase although forward contracting diminished.     Exports continue to recover slowly.     Continental competition has been particularly severe in India although the United Kingdom consignments of galvanized sheets to India in November were higher than in any month for the past three years.In Scotland steel production was somewhat lower but the further outlook is promising owing to new shipbuilding orders and to a &quot;better demand from constructional engineers.      Tube works were quiet.     Export markets are showing promising signs.
Although North East Coast iron and steel deliveries declined, production there in recent months has been greater than at any time since 1929.    Owing to the home demand for Cleveland pig iron producers have not buen pressing for export orders.    Sales of Hematite iron to Denmark and Italy have been more regular.   The scrap markut is firm.In the Sheffield district, works continue to be employed almost up to capacity and there is a slight expansion in export business.    Large turbine forgings and hollow forged boiler drums ere in good demand for the new extensions to electrical generating stations.In South Wales there has been a slight lull in activity, but trie outlook for the early part of 1935 is encouraging. Tin plate production has fallen in recent w^eks and the industry was operating at 58$ of capacity at the end   of November, part of this production going into stock.Machine Tools.      In the home trade the position continues satisfactory.    In Novanber exports of machine tools amounted to   160,000, which is an improvement on the last two months.    Exports to Russia increased as compared with October. Imports amounted to 5108,000 and showed a considerable decline on the October figures which were abnormal owing to the annual exhibition at Olympia.Chemicals.      Deliveries of alkalies were at a lower level in the home trade during November, but exports were well maintained.    The improvement in chlorine products continued:    this was due partly to large seasonal exports of bleaching powder.    Home sales of dyestuffs declined from the high level of October, but foreign ssles were satisfactory. The market for coal tar products has been patchy, creosote and tor maintaining their -position, while business in pitch was disappointing.    There was littLe change in wood distillation products, but pharmaceutical chemicals were in bo-tt^r dimund than for some time past.
Motor Trade.     A significant feature of the home trade in the past few months is the maintenance of sales of commercial vehicles above the level reaohed in the same period of 1933.In Australia the recent revision of the definition of a &quot;motor vehicle chassis&quot;permits duty-free import of a number of British components formerly dutiable separately.     The duty on these components when imported separately has also been reduced.      The industry, however, is concerned at the delay in dealing with the larger questions of the duty on body panels and the substitution of weight for ad valorem duties,Shipments of assembled motor vehicles to New Zealand have now virtually ceased,  in view of the increased tariff to oome into force on the 1st January next.Motor vehicles newly registered in October amounted to 25,533, an increase of 7,023 (37.9$) over last year&apos;s figure. The increase comprised 5,150 private cars and 1,873 other vehicles.     2,789 motor cycles were newly registered, an increase of 15.9$ over the previous October.Light Metal Industries.     Though business In cutlery and plate has declined from its recent high level, it is still fair. All branches of the tool trade continue to be active, both for the home and export markets.       Conditions remain good in the needle industry, in the lock and allied trades and In the foundry industry.     Press work, metal smallwares and enamelled hollow-ware   remain at recent levels.     Demand in the metallic bedstead trade has fallen off, while in architectural metal work it remains poor.     There is a welcome revival in trade in the non-ferrous metals section.      Prospects for the new year are decidedly good and the export trade is tending to increase. The copper market was active and it is understood that producers are considering the restriction of output by agreement until prices improve.     Tin and lead prices have been somewhat easier and continental spelter has been freely offered.
Electrical Industry.     During November, 1,595 million units of electricity were produced as compared with 1,421 million the year before.    For the first 11 months of 1934 the increase in production over last year amounts to 15.655.    Orders received for heavy plant continued at the improved level of recent months.    Orders for light material continued to expand 7,1 La the exception of wireless goods, the importation of which has recently been heavy.    South Africa continues to be the best export market and the industry is anxious as to the effects or the Barter Agreement recently announced between Germany and South Africa by -vhich wool from the latter is to be exchanged for rolling stock and electrical naohinery.Soa-p, Oils   and Kindred Industries.      The unexpected weakness in the butter market has lod to dull conditions in the margarine trade.    The total volume of turnover for the current year to date is still more than 13^ below that of last year.   There has been a seasonal advance in the trade in all edible compounds, and prices have increased slightly.    In raw materials there was a definite recovery in trade in November accompanied by a small increase in the general price level.Building.       House building is steady at its increased level and if interest rates remain low snd the general trade recovery persists,  some further advance is probable in the Spring.    The building of houses following slum clearances should accelerate, but will be subject to seasonal influences during the next three months.    The low level of interest rates may also    induce public Authorities to execute necessary public building works.Paper. There was a revival in the demand for practically all classes of paper in October and November and seasonal buying in connection with the Christmas trade was greater than last year. The

The total volume of turnover for the current year to date is still more than l3-,a below that of last year.   There has been a seasonal advance in the trade in all edible compounds, and prices have increased slightly.

The building of houses following slum clearances should accelerate, but v/ill be subject to seasonal influences during the next three months.    The low level of interest rates may also    induce public Authorities to execute necessary public building works.Paper, There was a revival in the demand for practically all classes of paper in October and November and seasonal buying in connection with the Christmas trade was greater than last year. The
demand  or newsprint is good, &quot;but mills are still working at a narrow margin of profit and Canadian competition, both in the home market and Australia, is severe. There has been a better demand for paper boards. The recent addition of bleached straw pulp to the free list should lead to manufacturers using larger quantities of tnis material. There has been some reduction in the price of imported sulphite wood pulp.Retail Trade.    The value of retail sales in October was 3.2$ greater than in October, 1933, indicating that improve-ment is continuing slowly but steadily.    The principal increase recorded was in boots and shoes (9.2$).    The improvement was experienced in all areas, Suburban London and the North of England showing the largest increases in non-food departments and Suburban London and Scotland in food departments.    Stocks during October were 1.2$ greater than in October of last year. Preliminary figures suggest that the improvement has continued in November.Co-o-q^ratl ve Trade.    The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks ended 10th November show an increase of 14.4% as compared with the corresponding period last year. The weighted average of wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities show a decrease in price of 2.083? compared with a year ago.   Retail prices have decreased by 0.02$ on the same basis.The sales of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society ior the quarter ended 10th November were  5,021,000, an inorease of  589,000, or 13.5$, over the corresponding period of 1933.Coiton.     The improvement during October in production and employment c-ntinued in November,  though conditions remain less favourable than a year ago.
Weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were higher than in October, the American section, aocourrting for the bulk of the increase.     The course of prices was steadily upwards. Spinners in the American section were probably able to maintain their margins, but it is doubtful if this was the case with high quality Egyptian yarns.Exports of cotton yarns at 10.6m. lbs. were below those for October (10.9m. lbs).     Germany and Roumania increased their takings substantially compared with October, but shipments to Scandinavia and Argentina declined.     Exports of piece goods amounted to 172.4m.  sq. yards as against 175.6m. sq. yards in October and 170,5m.  sq. yards a year ago. Shipments to most major British markets increased and exports to India were 51.9m. sq. yards as compared with 36.4m. sq. yards a year ago.     Exports to most European countries, except Germany, Holland and Switzerland, fell off and the same is true of African markets, the Dutch East Indies and South America.Wool.      The seasonal improvement in the general activity of the industry has continued in November though it has been less apparent in the woollen sections.     There was an improvement in the employment position which, however, is not so good as a year ago.     Exports of yarns and tissues declined in November as compared with October and with November a year ago.     Prices of raw v/ool showed little change, though the tendency was downwards.Reports indicate that new orders and enquiries are rather scarce.EMPIRE TRADE.Canadian Trade.      In general there was some recession in October from the high level of the precoding month.     The index of the physical volume of business was 95.8 In October compared with 97.1 in September, and the index of commodity prices also fell slightly.     Exports of zinc and copper showed
marked improvement &quot;but the gain in nickel exports was less than normal for the season.     Imports of &quot;bauxite showed an Increase, Flour milling showed a sharp deoline hut the live stock industry recorded considerable improvement and there was a good increase in the output of newsprint and in exporte of wood pulp.     The motor car industry was quiet and tyre production showed a decrease,Australian Trade.      The number of bales of wool received into store between 1st July and 30th October was 1,660,000 against 1,680,000 a year ago.     Of these 467,000 vrere cold or exported, the figure for the corresponding period laflt year being 788,000s     Shipments of wheat and flour for the season were equivalent to 93,000,000 bushels of wheat, against 149,000,000 buchels in 1935,     Exports of butter for the same period show an increase, however, from 32,500 tons in 1933 to 37,000 tons this year.     Total imports of merchandise in October were  8,184,000 (Australian currency) against  6,167,000 a year ago.Indian,trade Imports of merchandise amounted in October to 1,247 lakhs of rupees and exports to 1,237 lakhs as against 1,062 lakhs and 1,291 lakhs respectively a year earlier. The wholesale price index number in Calcutta remained at the level of the last three months. Standing crops are again stated to be in good condition, but it is reported that rain is badly needed in the Punjab,SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.     The official trade figures for the first nine months of 1934 show an increase in value of exports of 27,5$ antf of imports of 21.3$ as compared with the same period of 1933.     The 1934 figures are inflated to the extent of about 20$ due to the depreciation of the peso.     Of the total value of imports for this period the proportion from the United Kingdom has increased from 21,5$ in 1933 to 23$ this year and from the United States from 12,1$ to 15.3$.
The Government has adequate exchange at present in hand, for disposal at official rates, to pay for current imports from Great Britain and to meet the needs of British Public Utility Companies for debenture and similar financial services.The total yield of the cereal harvest is expected to be below normal,Brazil,     The financial situation continues to chow improvement, but it seems doubtful whether British exporters will benefit appreciably,,     The exchange produced by 80$ of the coffee exports at the official rate is now allocated to meet the foreign duty service and 60$ of the cost of imports, the amount applied to meet the latter being distributed proportionately to each country according to its coffee purchases.     Since Great Britain buys little coffee, her exporters are able to obtain little official exchange and have to turn to the free market, which places them at a disadvantage of 20$.
