[This Document is tbe Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government.]Printed/for the Cabinet.   November 1934.Copy NoCABINET.Palestine Legislative Council.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.There are certain considerations which I think it right to bring to the notice of my colleagues in connection with the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, CP. 250 (34). Needless to say, I realise the great difficulty of cases such as this which involve the conflicting interests of different racial and religious comnnmities. But I feel hound to approach the matter from the point of view of possible reactions in India. For if the Arab community should feel that their legitimate interests are not adequately safeguarded, the proposals may have an unfortunate effect on the attitude of the Indian Moslems.In the first place, I am somewhat troubled as to the possibility that the proposals for the allocation of seats in the Legislative Council may have adverse reactions on Moslem opinion in India, since it seems to me that these proposals give the Jews a double advantage as against the Moslems. I understand that the estimated population of Palestine in 1933 (excluding Bedouin) was : Moslems       - - -      723,427-Tews - - -      209,207Christians    - - -        95,165If we first take the proposed numbers of elected members (eight Moslems and three Jews), these population figures give a higher ratio for Jews than for Moslems, viz. one Moslem seat to about 90,000 of population and one Jewish seat to about 70,000. But then in addition to this it is proposed that the Jews should have five nominated members as against only two for the Moslems. Thus if we add the nominated to the elected members there would be ten Moslems and eight Jews. This results in a ratio to population of one Moslem seat to 72,000 and one Jewish seat to 20,000, a ratio nearly three times as high for the Jews as for the Moslems.If the nominated Jewish members were reduced from five to two we should have a total of ten Moslems and five Jews, giving a ratio to population of one Moslem seat to 72,000 and one Jewish seat to 41,000, which would be practically identical with the ratio under the 1923 proposals, when eight Moslem and two Jewish seats were contemplated in a population of 590,890 Moslems and 83,794 Jews (census figures of 1922).While I quite agree as to the soundness of the principle of having nominated as well as elected members, I cannot help fearing that the much greater weightage which it is now proposed by this means to give to the Jews as compared with the proposals put forward in 1923 will provoke comment which may have a serious effect on the Moslems in India and possibly lead them to draw unfavourable comparisons between the weightage given to the minority community in Palestine and that which the Moslem community in India will enjoy under the Communal Award. I would therefore ask whether the Secretary of State for the Colonies could not consider some step in the direction oC reducing the Aveightage given to the Jews, for example by some readjustment of the numbers of the nominated members. I realise that it would upset the balance of the Legislative Council to give the Moslems a majority as against all other sections, but I suggest that this result might be prevented by increasing the proposed number of official members or the representation of other elements, in order to make up for some diminution of the number of nominated Jewish members.In the second place it appears to me that the functions of the Legislative Council are perhaps rather vaguely described in the draft despatch, and I am notSECRET.CP. 270 (3-1).329165   11.34
quite clear as to the extent of its proposed powers (e.g. in regard to voting supply) and those of the High Commissioner. With a little morn time it might perhaps he possible, by working the scheme out in greater detail, to go further in the direction of forestalling Moslem objections. Two particular questions which at present suggest themselves to my mind are (a) whether it would not be well to exclude the discussion of questions affecting religion, which might lead to unnecessary friction, from the purview of the Council, and (6) whether it would be possible in the Instructions to give the High Commissioner a special charge for the protection of Moslems or generally of backward communities.India Office, 24th November 1934,S.
