THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 226 (34).CABINET.STATE OF BUSINESS IN THE KING&apos;S BENCH DIVISION OF THEROYAL COURTS OF JUSTICE.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.I AM compelled to draw the attention of my colleagues to the state ofbusiness in the King&apos;s Bench Division, and to lay before them proposals for removing the congestion which now exists there and for meeting, to some extent,the demands which have found utterance both in the resolutions of the professionalsocieties and in the public press.-*The Public Demand.2. The General Council of the Bar on the 12th March, 1934 reported in favour of an increase in the number of members of the Court of Appeal, on the ground that the proposals of the Hanworth Committee, whereby appeals from County Courts go direct to the Court of Appeal, and the restriction of the right of trial by jury, would greatly increase the work of the Court of Appeal and render it impossible that that work should be discharged by two Courts, consisting as they do at present of the Master of the Rolls and five Lords Justices. For reasons hereafter to be given, I am not inclined to recommend the adoption of this particular form of remedy. I note the fact of the resolution, however, as evidence of the opinion of this branch of the profession that further judicial strength is required.3. On the 25th September, 1934, the President of the Law Society in his Address to the Annual Meeting of that Society at Newcastle, expressed his view that the &quot;best and cheapest remedy for speeding up litigation&quot; is &quot;to have more Judges.&quot; I have no doubt from such communications and conversations as I have had from and with other members of the solicitors profession that this represents the view both of the Council of the Law Society and of the profession generally.4. On the 20th July a Motion was handed in at the Table of the House of Commons in the names of 74 legal members of the House of Commons, to the same effect as the resolution of the Bar Council to which I have referred. The Motion has not come on for discussion.5. There have been numerous letters in the Times, including one from Lord Wright on the 5th October, and one from Lord Justice Greer on the 6th October, the object of both of which appears to be to point the necessity for more judicial strength. The facts stated in Lord Justice Greer&apos;s letter are not strictly accurate, as will be seen by reference to the Appendix to this Memorandum. But the argument remains unaffected.6.   I now turn to consider the position in the King&apos;s Bench Division.7. I have added to this Memorandum two Appendices one giving an historical survey showing the numbers of puisne common law judges now and in the past.
8. It will be observed from this Memorandum that what may be called the standard number of Judges of the Division is one Lord Chief Justice and 15 puisnes, to which number two more can be added upon the passing of resolutions by both Houses of Parliament. At the present moment, the number which, until.&apos; the beginning of this Term was 18, has been reduced to 16 by the promotion of Mr. Justice (now Lord Justice) Roche and by the resignation of Mr. Justice Acton. The first step, therefore, to be considered immediately is whether those vacancies should be filled and whether for that purpose the necessary resolutions should be proposed to both Houses.9. The second Appendix contains such figures relating to the work of the King&apos;s Bench Division in recent years as appear to be relevant to the consideration of the general questions dealt with in this Memorandum. The second question arising is whether upon those figures the strength of the Division, even when the resolutions have been passed and acted upon, will be sufficient to cope with the work to be done and to dispose of the arrears which have accumulated, or whether, on the other hand, statutory provision should be made for a further accession td the judicial strength.10. The general inference to be drawn from the figures appears to be that whenever the number of Judges of the Division has been allowed to fall below 18 (including the Lord Chief Justice), arrears have accumulated. Until recently, whenever the number has been maintained at 18, the judicial strength has been sufficient not only to cope with the work, but to effect a considerable reduction year by year in the amount of arrears. The alarming feature about the present situation is that, while in earlier years the full strength of 18 has, as a general rule, been able to reduce the amount of whatever arrears might be then outstanding by approximately 20 per cent., in the years 1930, 1931 and 1932 the amount of the arrears has risen, although the staff has been maintained at the higher figure.11. I should perhaps explain in what sense I use the word arrears. Where the cases pending at the end of the year exceed the number of those pending at the commencement of the year, I have regarded the year as having accumulated arrears to the extent of that excess. Where the number pending at the end of the year has fallen short of the number pending at the commencement of the year, I have regarded the arrears as reduced during that year to the extent of that deficiency.12. There are certain special features in the Tables to which I should direct attention. The intake in the Division is to be measured by the number of writs and other originating proceedings. Taking the figures from 1922 to 1933 inclusive, while there have been some peculiar fluctuations in particular years for causes which it is difficult to assess, there is, on the whole period, a remarkable stability. The average for all those years is 55,766. The year producing the highest figure was 1922, when 61,268 writs, &amp;c, were issued. The lowest year was 1928, when there were only 48,483. The year 1933 produced 53,162, which, as will be noticed, is below the average of the whole period.13. There is, therefore, no great increase of litigation in the King&apos;s Bench Division and, on the other hand, there is no great falling off.14. But the amount of work to be done by the Judges of the Division is to be measured not only by the number of writs, but by the number of cases set down for trial.15. We can, for the purpose of comparison, omit the work done on Assize, the criminal work generally (including the work of the Court of Criminal Appeal), and the lists of appeals to the Divisional Court which are set down in the Crown Paper and Civil Paper.16. On the 1st January of each of the years in question there have been a number of King&apos;s Bench actions already entei^ed for trial, but not yet tried, a number which on the average has been 1,059.17. In each of the years when there were 18 Judges, namely, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928 and 1933, not only was the current work got through, but the arrears were also reduced by a percentage which on the average was 18.
18. A somewhat similar inference seems to be deducible from the figures contained in Appendix III, in which is set out the length of time for which the oldest case in each of the five main lists in the King&apos;s Bench Division has been standing for trial in the years 1933 and 1934.19. It will be observed that 1934 shows a slight improvement in the Crown Paper and a very slight improvement in the Common Jury List a fact attributable in the case of the Common Jury List to the very large reduction in the number of cases set down for trial by a Judge and common jury. The Non-Jury List, on the other hand, shows a large deterioration; the Special Jury List a deterioration of one month, and the Civil Paper a deterioration of one month. These figures must be taken with caution, as there may be special circumstances to which the delay in hearing a particular case may be due.20. On the other hand, in the years when there were less than 18 Judges, arrears began to accumulate.21. It seems abundantly clear that the Division cannot keep abreast of its w7ork unless its members are kept steadily up to 18, so long as its work consists in part of the accumulated arrears of the previous years. On the other hand, it seems clear that, with 18, the Division, upon the average figures of the period taken, can deal with an amount of judicial work equal to the amount arising in the year and a little more. But, regard being had to the increase in the number of cases set down during the last thi*ee years and the general tendencj&apos; as shown by the Table of figures in cases for trial, the conclusion seems to be that with 18 Judges and with all arrears disposed of, there would be but little margin.22. My first conclusion, therefore, is that there is no prospect in the years to come that less than 18 Judges will be at all times required, and my first recommendation, therefore, is that the necessity for passing a resolution in order to enable the number to be kept up at 18 should be abrogated by Statute. It will, of course, immediately be necessary to pass a resolution authorising appointments to the two vacancies now existing, but I should propose that this necessity should not arise in the future.23. The argument in favour of this course, based on the figures given above,, is strengthened by the inconvenience which occurs when a vacancy which cannot be filled without recourse to Parliament occurs during the Recess. On the present occasion, for example, a whole month of the Legal Term must elapse with one vacancy unfilled, and a fortnight before means can be found to fill the second. Furthermore, though it is no doubt desirable that the state of business of the Law Courts should from time to time engage the mind of Parliament, it is highly inconvenient that opportunities for frequent debate on the subject should arise. I mean by inconvenient not that it disturbs official routine, but that it raises questions and, on occasion, tempers in a manner unbecoming to the subject under discussion.24. This, however, by itself is not enough to deal with the present situation. As already pointed out, we were faced at the end of the year 1933 with an arrear of 1,052 cases. The figures for the first nine months of 1934 show that no progress whatever is being made towards clearing off this weight.25. Indeed, at a casual glance it would appear as though a further 300 cases in arrears had been accumulated. This, however, it is to be hoped, is merely a seasonal increase. It cannot be expected that immediately after the Vacation the figures should bear the most favourable aspect.26. The complaints which are embodied or lie implicit in the resolutions and letters mentioned in the earlier part of the Memorandum, though they do not indicate this mass of arrears as the true disease, are, in truth, its outcome. It is not right that year by year an increasing number of cases should be left undisposed of. If the process is pursued long enough the result most be a denial of justice. Indeed, the mere existence of any substantial number of arrears is a great evil. It not only denies justice to the man whose case is held back, but it causes many other resulting ills. So long as delay exists, resistance to just claims by defendants who have no real defence is encouraged and multiplied.
Plaintiffs with just claims are kept out of their money or left with their characters unvindicated or are forced to improper settlements. Furthermore, the whole judicial routine is upset. Slackness follows upon the observation that no one much cares whether business is not despatched with reasonable energy. It appears to me imperative that this state of things should be brought to an end.27. My proposal in this respect is that there should be a temporary addition of 2 Judges to the King&apos;s Bench Division. I propose that the precedent of 1910 should be followed and that statutory authority should be sought at once for the immediate appointment of the two new Judges.&quot; but that, upon the occurrence of vacancies reducing the number to not more than 18, those vacancies should not be filled except upon a resolution. My colleagues will observe that I am forced to this proposal for a temporary reinforcement upon the logic of my previous argument, which leads to the conclusion that, when the number, is increased to 20, the current work of the Division will be despatched with ease and rapid progress made with the discharge of arrears.28. At the same time I make the proposal with reluctance. Difficulties of accommodation must arise and the business of organising the work of the Division must necessarily increase with every increase of the numbers of the judicial staff. Furthermore, I think it not improbable that the appointment may involve additions to the subordinate staff-possibly in the number of Taxing Masters and almost certainly in the number of clerks, but I think that these difficulties must be faced.29. Furthermore, in addition to these technical difficulties, I regard any increase in the judicial staff as only justifiable, if at all, by the extreme pressure of circumstances. Doubt must necessarily arise, when the figures are examined, whether the present judicial staff, when maintained at the figure of 18, could not, without reinforcement, deal with the current work and reduce the arrears if the work were organised efficiently and if every Judge were occupied up to his full capacity. An addition to the numbers is open to the criticism that it is more difficult to manage a staff of 20 Judges than one of 18, and it may be suggested that, in the end, disorganisation will be increased and no more work will be done with a larger staff. But beyond this there is an objection on principle. I regard the maintenance of the prestige of the Judicial Bench as vital to the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of our system of civilisation. That prestige in the past has been largely due to the small number of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the high respect in which that small college has been held. Any increase of numbers must tend somewhat to lower the quality. Again, the judicial faculty is not one which is possessed by all men and is not necessarily to be found among the more brilliant advocates at the Bar. A man who is to appointed to the Bench should not only possess it in a high degree, but should have, in addition, learning, experience and the respect of his professional brethren. He must also be between certain somewhat narrow limits of age. There cannot be expected to be found at the Bar at any given moment an unlimited supply of people of the right age, of the right experience and possessing the other qualities which I have enumerated. The position is not rendered easier by the disproportion which now exists between the salary of a Judge and the income which may be earned by.a King&apos;s Counsel in large, or even in moderately large, practice. I put these considerations on record. But, as will be seen, I am forced with regret to the conclusion that, weighty as they are, they do not outweigh the reasons for an increase in the Bench on this particular occasion.30. I should add a word at this stage on the cost of the proposals. The immediate result will be to lay a charge upon the Consolidated Fund for the salaries of two Judges (at present  9,000 per annum to be increased at an early date, I hope, to  10,000) and upon the Vote of  1,020 for the salaries of two Judges&apos; Clerks. This sum of money is not all clear loss. If the Judges appointed clear off the arrears to the extent which I anticipate, there will in each year during their tenure of office be an increase in the amount of judicial fees taken. The amount cannot be quantified. But I deprecate any attempt to estimate in money the result of a reform which I regard as imperative in the public interest, further than to see that it is not extravagant in itself and is justified by the emergency.
31. I feel bound to add a few words upon the remedies which have been proposed and which will be raised again during any discussion of the Govern-ment&apos;s proposal. The one deserving notice is that which proposes the addition of three Lords Justices to the Court of Appeal. It is supported chiefly by the two following arguments, namely : (1) The effect of the Act of last Session, which sent appeals from the County - Court direct from that Court to the Court of Appeal, must be tooverwhelm the Court of Appeal; and (2) The effect of the Act of- 1933, which altered the right of the litigant toa jury in a civil case, will result in a great increase of appeals.because it will be found that the Court of Appeal is more ready to disturb a finding of fact by a Judge sitting alone than by a jurywhere properly directed.32. On the first point, it is stated that the addition to the work of the Court of Appeal of all the County Court appeals previously heard by the Divisional Court will in all probability make the task of the Court of Appeal greater than can be performed by the Master of the Rolls and five Lords Justices. There is considerable doubt what the extent of the additional burden will be. In a normal year in the past the Court of Appeal has generally been able to get through its work and to offer some assistance wherever it was needed in the High Court. Last year they were unable to do so by reason of some peculiarly heavy appeals. There is, therefore, in a normal year a slight margin, though it is conceded that this margin will be more than absorbed by the number of County Court appeals. In an average year before the passing of the Act of 1934, which gave a direct appeal from the County Court to the Court of Appeal, a hundred appeals from the County Court were heard by the Divisional Court of the King&apos;s Bench Division. During the first eleven days of the present sittings, two Courts of the Court of Appeal have disposed of seventy appeals from the County Courts, absorbing, in fact, the work of one Court for twenty-one and a half days (the half-day is represented by the diversion of the work of the Court to another subject). It would appear, therefore, that in an ordinary year the County Court appeals can be disposed of by three Lords Justices or Judges sitting in one Court of Appeal in thirty days. In order to constitute a third Court of Appeal it was necessary to borrow two Judges from the King&apos;s Bench Division, but if matters had remained as they were before the passing of the Act of 1934 these two Judges would have been engaged during an equivalent period in doing the same work in their own division.33. We are therefore left with a deficiency of one person, equivalent to a Lord Justice, for ten days (or a little less, because the abolition of the dual appeal lessens the total burden by an amount equivalent to the time occupied in those cases in which there was in fact an appeal from the Divisional Court to the Court of Appeal). Hitherto we have had no difficulty in finding this third member of the third court from the voluntary help of other great judicial officers, and I see no reason to anticipate that we shall have any difficulty in the future. This necessity of finding an extra judicial personage for a little less than ten days is. moreover, only temporary, for, as I have already pointed out, when the arrears of the King&apos;s Bench have been wiped out, we shall have a considerable margin of strength, and we can then deal with the matter either by a reduction of the total number of Judges or by the appointment of an additional Lord Justice, or by such other means as will at the time be convenient. These few observations appear to me to show how extravagant is the proposal for the permanent constitution of a third Court of Appeal by the appointment of three new Lords Justices, so far as it is based upon the abolition of the Divisional Court in County Court cases.34. I now turn to the other branch of the argument that based on the supposed increase of the work of the Court of Appeal by reason of the decrease in jury trials. This argument can be disposed of almost in a line. There is no increase due to this change. Figures are available for the nine months which immediately succeeded the coming into operation of the Statute. During that time there were 123 appeals to the Court of Appeal in non-jury cases, as against
114 in the previous corresponding period an increase of 9. There have also been 63 appeals in jury cases, as against 72 in the corresponding period in the previous year a decrease of 9.35. In conclusion, I should not be doing my duty to my colleagues if I did not attribute the increase of arrears, particularly during the last three years, to what I believe to be its true cause. During that period various steps have been taken to expedite litigation, the proportion of cases tried before a Judge alone to those tried before a jury has been greatly increased (a measure which, according to all previous experience, ought greatly to have reduced the demands on judicial time), and the time spent on Circuit has been reduced by the abolition of the Grand Jury. Yet there has been no corresponding increase in the discharge of business. I attribute this without any hesitation to mismanagement. So long as no attempt is made to organise the work of the King&apos;s Bench Division upon a business-like basis, the only remedy which can be from time to time applied is to increase the judicial strength. The Lord Chancellor cannot, either by his own action or that of his officers, interfere in the matter except in the most distant and indirect way. Suggestions have been made for the appointment of a Business Manager at the Courts. I am satisfied that such a Manager would meet with no success. The strength of his arm would depend entirely upon the support which he would receive or the obstruction which he would encounter in higher quarters. I must also draw attention to the degree of sickness among the judicial staff, which has been a noticeable feature of the last three years, and arises in part at least from the advanced age of some of its occupants. I have omitted till now mention of the assistance which has been rendered by Commissioners on Assize. The number of days on which Commissioners sat on Assize during the first nine months of this year is 154. The number of days upon which Judges have been absent through illness is 153. My calculations set out above are based upon the possession of a full time judicial staff of 20 Judges. If their duties are interfered with by illness, an equal need for the employment of Commissioners will arise in the future as in the past.36. I attach (Appendix III) a memorandum showing the work done during the tenure of office of the National Government by way of expediting and simplifying the procedure of the Supreme Court.37.   My recommendations, therefore, are : (1) Immediately to present to Parliament resolutions under section 11 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, for the appointment of Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division in the place of Lord Justice Roche and of Mr. Justice Action.(2) That authority should be given to the Attorney-General, when moving the Resolution in the House of Commons, and to myself, when moving the Resolution in the House of Lords, to announce that it is intended to make further provision for increasing temporarily the number of Judges in the King&apos;s Bench Division.(3) To present to Parliament at the earliest opportunity a Bill providing for-(a) the raising of the normal number of King&apos;s Bench Judges fromone Lord Chief Justice and 15 puisnes to one Lord Chief Justice and 17 puisnes, so as to abrogate the necessity for passing a resolution upon the occurrence of vacancies so long as the number is not increased above 18 in all;(b) to add two additional Judges to the King&apos;s Bench Division,applying to their appointments the procedure at present applicable to the appointment of the 17th and 18th Judge under section 11 of the Act of 1925.(Initialled)      S.House of Lords, S.W. 1. October 17, 1934.
APPENDIX I.BEFORE the reign of Richard III, the numbers of the Judges of each of the three Courts of Common Law varied from time to time, and there was no attempt to maintain an equality of numbers in each Court.Under Richard III The Court of King&apos;s Bench had one Chief Justice and two puisnes. The Common Pleas had one Chief Justice and three puisnes. The Court of Exchequer had one Chief Baron and three puisnes.Henry VII added an additional Judge to the Common Pleas and Henry VIII maintained these numbers. Under Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth each Court had one President and three puisnes.James I added one puisne each to the King&apos;s Bench and the Common Pleas, but he reduced the King&apos;s Bench again to four, and Charles I made a similar reduction in the Common Pleas.Thus, in the latter reign the establishment was fixed at one President and three puisnes for each Court, and these numbers continued until 1830, when, by 11 Geo. IV and 1 Wm. IV, cap. 70 (the Law Terms Act. 1830), an additional Judge was appointed to each Court, making a total in each Court of one President and four puisnes.In 1868 the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Viet., cap. 125). transferred the trial of election petitions from the House of Commons to the Judges of the Courts of Common Law, and, by section 11 .(8) and section 55. authorised the appointment of an additional Judge to each of the three Courts.Accordingly, upon the 25th August, 1868, Hayes, Brett and Cleasby were appointed respectively to the Courts of King&apos;s Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer, making the strength of each Court one President and five puisnes.The next alteration in the number of the Judges of the Courts of Common Law followed upon the operation of the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 and of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876. The Acts of 1873 (except sections 20, 21 and 55, which relate to the Court of Appeal proposed to be constituted under the Act of 1873 and to appeals to it and to the House of Lords) and 1875 came into operation together on the 1st November, 1875. Sections 20, 21 and 55 of the Act of 1873, so far as they came into operation at all, did so together with the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, on the 1st November, 1876.As the Act of 1875 amended the Act of 1873 before the latter had come into operation, and the Act of 1876 amended both those Acts before the appeal section of the former had come into operation, it is difficult to state concisely what their effect (so far as material to the present matter) was. It may perhaps best be summarised as follows : The Act of 1873 contemplated that the permanent establishment of the High Court should be twenty-one Judges, that is to say, four Chancery Judges (one Master of the Rolls and three Vice-Chancellors), two Judges of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and fifteen Judges of the Common Law Courts (Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleaes, Lord Chief Baron and twelve puisnes four in each Division with a power by Order in Council to reduce the number of Divisions of the High Court and abolish the offices of Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Chief Baron of the Exchequer).*This involved the reduction of the Common Law Judges (Presidents and puisnes taken together) from eighteen to fifteen; and section 5 of the Act of 1873 accordingly provided again in somewhat obscure words that new appointments should not be made until the number of the Common Law puisnes had been* The words used (see section 32 of the Act of 1873) are so obscure as to be almost incomprehensible. The intention no doubt was to give power to merge the Common Law Courts all together and to have only one Chief Justice instead of two Chief Justices and one Lord Chief Baron, but not, so far as this section is concerned, to reduce the number of Judges. It may be that the extreme partisans of fusion contemplated eventually a High Court in which there would not be any Divisions at all,
reduced below twelve. Before this provision for reduction came into operation section 3 of the Act of 1875 supervened. That section, after reciting the provisions of section 5 of the Act of 1873, recited that, &quot; having regard to the state of business in the several Courts . . . ., it is expedient that the number of Judges thereof should not at present be reduced,&quot; and repealed the provision.Thus, when the Act of 1875 came into operation, there were in office eighteen Common Law Judges (i.e., two Lord Chief Justices and one Lord Chief Baron, and five puisnes in each Division), but it should be observed that those Judges sitting as the Exchequer Chamber, discharged also the functions of a common law Court of Appeal.The Act of 1875 made fundamental alterations in the arrangements for appeals from the High Court proposed by the Act of 1873. The earlier Statute (see section 6) had contemplated a Court of Appeal comprising, besides the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice of England, the Master of the Rolls, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (who were to be ex of/icios), &quot; so many ordinary Judges (not exceeding nine at any one time) as Her Majesty shall from time to time appoint.&quot; The first ordinary Judges were to be the then existing Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (James and Mellish), the then existing salaried Judges of the Judicial Committee appointed under the Judicial Committee Act, 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Viet., cap. 91), who were four in number,* and such three other persons as Her Majesty may be pleased to appoint by Letters Patent.&quot; The Court of Appeal thus constituted was to exercise, in place of the House of Lords, the jurisdiction of that House in appeals from England.The Act of 1875, on the other hand, left the jurisdiction of the House of Lords as an appellate Court, where it was before the Act of 1873 passed. It constituted the Court of Appeal as a Court intermediate between the High Court and the House of Lords. It was to consist of the five ex officios mentioned above and three ordinary Judges, who were to be the two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery and &quot; such one other person as Her Majesty may be pleased to appoint by Letters Patent.&quot; Sir Richard Baggallay, then Solicitor-General, was appointed to the Court of Appeal under this power.The Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Viet., cap. 59), authorised the appointment of three more &quot; ordinary Judges of the Court of Appeal,&quot; and it directed that the first three appointments were to be made by the transfer to the Court of Appeal of three Judges of the High Court, and that the vacancies so created in the High Court &quot; shall not be filled up except in the event and to the extent hereinafter mentioned &quot; (see section 15). The Judges so transferred were to be taken from the three Common Law Divisions, from amongst Judges who had held office for not less than two years, and the Judges so transferred were laid under an obligation to go Circuit in the same manner as if they were Judges of the High Court.In execution of this power, Bramwell B., from the Exchequer, Brett J., from the Common Pleas, and Amphlett B., from the Exchequer, were transferred to the Court of Appeal.. The condition imposed by section 15 upon the filling up of the vacancies so created is described later in this memorandum. It is enough to say heie that it was not fulfilled immediately, and accordingly the vacancies created by these appointments to the Court of Appeal were not filled up. At the same time, however, another vacancy was created in the King&apos;s Bench Division by the appointment of Mr. Justice Blackburn to be a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary under the Act of 1876. Hawkins was appointed to the King&apos;s Bench Division in Blackburn&apos;s place and immediately transferred to the Exchequer Division, his place in the King&apos;s Bench Division being left unfilled. The vacancy in the Common Pleas and the other vacancy in the Exchequer Division were left unfilled. Thus the Common Law Judges were reduced in number to fifteen (three Presidents and twelve puisnes), but three of the Lords Justices remained, liable to perform some of the duties which would naturally fall upon the Judges of the High Court. &apos;.   :. ^ -&quot;&apos;In practice it was found that the obligation to go Circuit resting upon three of the Judges of the Court of Appeal could not be fulfilled without dislocating the arrangements of that Court. The result is that the number of Judges available to perform the ordinary work of the Common Law Courts has remaineo* Sir Barnes Peacock, Sir Montague Smith, Sir Robert Collier, Sir James Oolyilic.
ever since below that contemplated as necessary in 1876. As will appear here-after, measures have from time to time been taken to increase the judicial strength, but these were rendered necessary in each case by the then state of business on the Common Law side.In the autumn of 1880, Cockburn, Lord Chief Justice of England, and Kelly C.B.. died, and advantage was taken of the vacancies thereby created to take action under section 32 of the Act of 1873. On the 16th December, 1880, by an Order in- Council which came into operation on the 26th February, 1881, the Common Pleas and Exchequer Divisions were united in the King&apos;s Bench Division, and the offices of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Chief Baron were abolished. Coleridge, then Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was appointed Lord Chief Justice of England, and two puisnes were appointed in the place of the two Presidents. The number of Common Law Judges, therefore, was still fifteen, namely, the Lord Chief Justice and fourteen puisnes.The &quot;event&apos;&apos; and &quot;extent&quot; to be &quot;hereinafter mentioned,&quot; as indicated in section 15 of the Act of 1876, are described in section 18 of that Act, which is as follows : &apos;&apos; Whenever any two of the said paid Judges of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have died or resigned, Her Majesty may, upon an address from both Houses of Parliament representing that the state of business in the High Court of Justice is such as to require the appointment of an additional Judge, fill up one of the vacancies created by the transfer hereinbefore authorised by appointing one new Judge of the said High Court in any Division thereof; and, on the death or retirement of the remaining two paid Judges of the said Judicial Committee. Her Majesty may, upon the like address fill up in like manner another of the said vacancies, and from time to time fill up any vacancies occurring in the offices of Judges so appointed.&quot;Sir James Colville died on the 6th December, 1880, and Sir Robert Collier on the 27th October, 1886, and thereby a power arose to make an appointment under section 18, if such an address as that section contemplated were passed. No such action, however, was taken. Sir Barnes Peacock died on the 3rd December, 1890, and Sir Montague Smith on the 3rd May, 1891. But it was not until 1899 that any action was taken under the section. In that year Farwell J. was appointed to the Chancery Division.

VII and 1 Geo. V) authorised the appointment of two additional Judges of the High Court. These Judges were to be attached to the King&apos;s Bench Division, but it was provided that, whenever after the 1st August, 1911, the number of puisne Judges of the Division amounted to fifteen or more, a vacancy should not be filled up except upon the presentation of an address from both Houses &quot; representing that the state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Division requires that such vacancy should be filled.&quot;.  The Act came into operation on the 26th July, 1910.Walton J. died on the 25th September, 1910, and Jelf J. resigned before the end of the Vacation.

The Memorandum does not relate to Scotland or Northern Ireland. Most of the items in the list are matters within the purview of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, but they include some for which the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health, or the Board of Trade are responsible.(A) Litigation.The procedure of the Courts has been altered in many different ways with a view (a) to reducing the cost of litigation;(b) to preventing delay in the Courts; and(c) to saving judicial time.(B) The Common Law.A Standing Committee has been set up for enquiring into defects in the common law, and as a consequence some improvements in the law have already been made by statute, and others are under consideration.(C) Consolidation.The statute law has been improved by a series of Consolidation Acts on different subjects. In each case the scattered enactments relating to one subject have been repealed and replaced by a single Act, and the law has thereby become more accessible to the public.(D) Miscellaneous Reforms.(A) Litigation.I. A ppeals.The number of successive appeals to one court after another which litigants might inflict on one another under the law as it stood till recently has probably been the cause of more expense to parties and the subject of more criticism from the public than any other feature of our procedure.
III. Procedure.6. On May 1932 a change of great importance was made in our system of procedure. Rules were passed setting up a special new procedure which saves time and expense to litigants. This procedure is not in substitution for that previously existing, but an alternative. The new rules can be applied to all King&apos;s Bench actions with a few exceptions in cases such as defamation, malicious prosecution, breach of promise of marriage.7. A reduction has been made in the fees of Counsel and the remuneration of solicitors, the reduction in the case of solicitors extending to non-contentious matters.8. The cost of appealing to the House of Lords has been reduced by greatly diminishing the number of documents which have to be printed.9. The rules governing the printing of documents have been altered. In cases where previously documents had to be printed, they may now be reproduced by type lithography or stencil duplicating.10. The precedure for settling disputes about death duties has been simplified.11. Since the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act 1933, a person who desires to appeal against a conviction by a court of summary jurisdiction, but has not sufficient means to obtain legal aid for that purpose, may in suitable cases be granted free legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his appeal. Moreover the appellant need no longer enter into a recognisance as to costs.For hearing appeals under the Act a special standing committee of the justices of the county is now appointed by quarter sessions and is known as the appeal committee.12. In the winding-up of estates, an important arrangement has been made by which photographic copies of probate can be obtained at a low rate (Is.). This enables executors to prove their title to all the assets of the testator simultaneously as soon as probate is granted, and so saves delay, and therefore expense and clanger of loss in dealing with assets.Resolution of the General Council of the Bar, dated 29th June, 1932.Rules of the Supreme Court (No. 2), 1932 (R. 5), &amp; Solicitors&apos; Remuneration Order, 1932.Regulations of the Law Lords.R.S.C.

On the application of any party the Court may now appoint a Court Expert to give independent evidence. It is hoped that this will save the time of the Court and the expense incurred by the litigants, as well as making it easier for the Court to ascertain the truth and arrive at a just decision.14. Several changes have been made with regard to payment into Court, In particular a defendant in a libel action may now pay into court with a denial of liability. If the plaintiff takes the money out, but wishes to be publicly vindicated, another new rule allows him to apply to a Judge in Chambers for leave to make in open Court a statement approved by the Judge.15. The use of specially endorsed writs and summary judgments has now been extended to all cases except those to which the new procedure rules apply.stage16. The &quot; summons for directions *&apos; has been postponed to a later in the proceedings before the trial of an ordinary action, viz., from a point before the &apos;&apos; pleadings &apos;&apos; have begun to a point after the &apos;&apos; pleadings &apos;&apos; are closed. This is expected to enable the Court to intervene in the preparation of the case for trial, and so, for example, to prevent the expense of proving facts which it is not intended seriously to dispute or to authorise a cheaper method of proving particular facts, instead of a more expensive method.Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1934, 24 &amp; 25 Geo. 5, c. 41.(B) The Common Law.17. A Committee set up under the Chairmanship of Lord Hanworth has been considering different legal maxims and, following their report, amendments have been made to the law contained in the maxim &quot; actio personalis moritur cum persona &quot; and to the law as to the awarding of interest in civil proceedings.Hitherto no attempt has been made to improve by legislation the common law as expounded by judicial decision. The setting up of this Standing Committee is an attempt to provide permanent machinery for this purpose, and a further report (on tort joint feasors) is under consideration.Solicitors&apos; Act, 1932, 22 ft 23 Geo. 5, c. 37.Children ft Young Persons Act, 1932, 22 ft 23 Geo. 5, c. 46.23 Geo. 5, c. 12.Local Govorn-ment Act, 1933, 23 ft 24 Geo. 5, c. 51.County Courts (Amendment) Act, 1934, 24 ft 25 Geo. 5, c. 17.County Courts Act, 1934, 24 ft 25 Geo. 5, c. 53.(C) Consolidation.18. The Solicitors&apos; Acts were consolidated in 1932; twenty-seven Acts, of Parliament containing 232 sections were repealed, and nearly all the law relating to solicitors is now to be found in one Act.19. A consolidation has also been effected of the law relating to children and young persons. The principal statute on this subject was the Children&apos;s Act, 1908. A great many improvements in that Act were made in 1932 directed mainly to making better provision for the protection and welfare of the young, and the treatment of young offenders. These two Acts and a good many other enactments were repealed and replaced by the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933.20. The laws relating to Local Government have, all been consolidated in the Local Government Act of 1933. Over 250 enactments are repealed in whole or in part by this great Act.21. Far reaching reforms have been made in the County Court system. The County Courts (Amendment) Act, 1934, made amendments to nine, and repealed in whole or in part, eighteen Acts of Parliament. This Act is now incorporated in the County Courts Act, 1934, which consolidates practically the whole law relating to County Courts. Eight Acts have been completely repealed and thirteen others repealed in part.This Act will come into force as soon as the necessary revision of the Pules of Procedure has been completed.
(D) Miscellaneous Reforms.22.   An international system has been established under which judgments The Fo^fn for sums of money obtained in English Courts can be enforced more easily than (Recfpnlcal before in other countries. \ct0i933eut)Conventions under the Act are being negotiated with this object with the 23Cdco. 5,&apos;c. 13. Governments of other countries, and arrangements under the Act are being made with other parts of the British Empire.23.   Another international system has been started in order to make it easier 5pQr^yidence. and cheaper for a person seeking to establish a claim in this country to prove a Domfmon, &amp; birth, marriage, or death registered in another country.   The system has been m&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;Aalv^0CU&quot; applied to one foreign country (Belgium), and arrangements are being made to 1933, 23 Geo. 5, apply it to different parts of the British Empire, and to France. c- 4-&apos;24.   Alterations have been made in the law relating to patents and designs. Patents and designs Act, 1932, 22 &amp; 23 Geo. 5, c. 32.25.   Provision has been made for the winding-up of insolvent Assurance T,ho Assuranceox CompaniesCompanies. (Winding-iip)Act, 1933, 23 Geo. 5, c. 9.26.

Certain limited amendments have been made in the law relating to the j^tionaht nationality of married women, the main result of which is to save women from and status of the position of being stateless. i^m&apos;1^^ 2429.   Various reforms of a technical nature have been carried out by which Geo.&apos;5, c. 49. provision has been made (a) for granting Probate or administration where the deceased person left -\dministra-v &apos; 0      ,   , 0 v tion of Justiceno estate.
