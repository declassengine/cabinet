THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.CP.   247  (34).COPY NOC A B I N E T.THE NAVAL CONFERENCE1935.STATEMENT OF THE BRITISH POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE JAPANESE PROPOSALS.(As approved by the Cabinet Committee at their Meeting heldon November 6th, 1954).( Circulated by the direction of the Prime Minister. )(l)     We have no intention of wounding Japanese feelings by insisting on the public expression of a fundamental  and permanent ratio nor do we think that insistence on such a course would be helpful to any of the three Powers principally concerned.(2)       On the other hands it is impossible for this country to accept in its present form the J&apos;apanese proposal for a common upper limit of total tonnage because this would involve the nation in constant uncertainty and unsettlement and would5 . in practice;, open the way for a strong militarist propaganda here which it is vital to avoid, We cannot bind ourselves to an arrangement whicha if implemented3 deprives us of securi tyn(3)      Consequentlywe must concentrate on getting an agreement on building programmes3 though v/e would be prepared to subscribe to a general declaration laying down the fundamental principle of equality of national status as between the parties to any future treaty,, if this would facilitate agreement on future building programmes.       An example of such a declaration is given in Annex I.(4)      If the Japanese Government are unwilling that an agreement in regard to future building programmes should be expressed in
1 3 9treaty form,, v/e should to e prepared to accept an arrangement whereby each party to the treaty would make a separate declaration of its intentions in the matter of naval construction over a specific period, of yeax-s3  the terms of such declarations toeing agreed between the parties beforehand.       Each Power would be at liberty to modify the figures contained in its declaration on advance notice to this effect having been given to the other parties to the treaty,       A form of draft declaration from which the element of &quot;ratio&quot; is completely eliminated is contained in Annex II.(5)     We should only be prepared to agree to the above measures of quantitative limitation if satisfactory provisions in regard, to future qualitative limitation were to be included in a future international treaty.(6)     If the Japanese Government were to accept in principle a plan on the above lines5 the next task would be to secure agreement on actual programmes.      We are still of opinion that there is no justification for any Japanese claim to a change in relative naval strengths and we snould therefore endeavour to persuade Japan to  accept a building programme which would in practice leave the present relative positions unaffected.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1. 7th November,  1934.
1 o annex I.Form of dec lai-at ion of equality of national s tat us (for use in any future naval treaty)..56(Based on tho formula contained in IT. CM. (-55)  19) ./The principle of equality of national status be-tv;een all the Powers signatories of the present treaty is mutually and unreservedly recognised.      As regards naval strengths, it is a guiding principle that they should he based on the minimum limits required for the national security of the respective powers3 and these limits necessarily vary according to circumstances/.      The voluntary acceptance by a particular&apos; contracting party of a specific quota of naval construction over a period of years is to be regarded simply as the expression of that country&apos;s naval needs of the moment and not as any derogation of the/foregoing/principle of equality of national status between tne parties.7i   Note.If a shorter and less emphatic formula is preferred, the words in brackets could be omitted.
ANNEX II.Form of draft declaration for notifying future building programmes.The .........................  Government 3 bearing inmind the provisions relating to equality of national statuscontained in article ........  of the Treaty signed thisdays have the honour to make the following declaration:-They do not anticipate that the needs of their national security will, during the periods /January 1st, 1937 - December 31st, 1941, and January 1st, 194^ -December 31st, 1940^7 impose upon them the construction or acquisition of naval tonnage beyond the figures set out, under the different categories of vessels of v,ar, in the Table&quot; attached hereto.      Accordingly it is not their intention that their construction or acquisition of naval tonnage shall exceed the said figures during the periods stated, and they do not propose to lay down or acquire, in any one year, more than a/5  of the total tonnage in any category set out in the Table for the period covering the year in question.Should, any change of circumstances so materially affect the needs of their national security as to necessitate a departure from the figures set out in the Table attached hereto, or the laying down or acquisition in any one year of more than % of the total tonnage in any category set out for the period covering the year in question, the................... Government will at once inform theother Parties to the Treaty signed this day, and will be willing to confer with them on the situation in such manner as may be deemed appropriate in the circumstances.*   Table to be agreed between all parties making the Declaration.
