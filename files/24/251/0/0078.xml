Copy No.CP. 303 (34).CABINET.[R 7278/5311/67 IRESUME OF CONVERSATION AT THE QUAI DORSAY BETWEEN M. FLANDIN (PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL), M. PIERRE LAVAL (FOREIGN MINISTER) AND M. LEGER, REPRE-SENTING THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND SIR JOHN SIMON. SIR GEORGE CLERK AND MR. CAMPBELL.Saturday, December 22, 1934. M. FLANDIN, who had been the host at lunch, expressed the pleasure which he and M. Laval felt at the opportunity of meeting the British Foreign Secretary again and of discussing with him current questions.Sir&apos; John Simon reciprocated these sentiments and said that he was charged by the British Cabinet with a message for the French Ministers to the following-effect. The Government in London had been closely considering the immediate European situation and they were convinced that it called for definite and prompt action and that things could not be allowed to drift. We had not only stated in Parliament our information as to German rearmament, but we had officially communicated this to Germany. Consequently, if matters were left alone there was a grave danger that Germany would treat our communication as amounting to acquiescence in, and authority for, German rearmament. That was not our intention at all. We, therefore, earnestly desired an early opportunity for consulting formally and officially with the French Government as to the course now to be taken, for the last thing we should wish would be any weakening in the co-operation which had recently been so fruitful in the matter of the Saar and of the Yugoslav-Hungarian dispute. It was for this reason that we had, as M. Flandin knew, recently made enquiries as to whether he and M. Laval would be prepared to pay us a visit in London. We still thought that this would be most useful and considered that official consultation between the two Governments was urgent.Sir John said that he appreciated that the view was held in some quarters that it would be better to wait until after the Saar question was settled, but he questioned whether this was a wise course. If the result of the Saar plebiscite and what followed it was a German success, Germany would be less amenable than she was now, and might soon be beyond the reach of negotiation. On the other hand, the spectacle of Anglo-French consultation before the Saar matter was settled might have a very useful moderating effect.M. Flandin interposed to refer sympathetically to our wish to receive French Ministers in London and said that he was in very general accord with the con-siderations which Sir John had put forward. He would ask the French Foreign Minister to deal with the matter more in detail.&apos;M. Laval also expressed sympathetic approval of the line indicated. He emphasised the extremely satisfactory character of recent Anglo-French co-operation at Geneva and repeated what he had said about it in his recent speech before the Senate. Our readiness to help in the matter of the Saar and in the Yugoslav dispute had made an immense impression, and he was convinced that the continuance of close Anglo-French co-operation was the most important influence for European peace. He then described the immediate objects of his own policy in the realm of foreign affairs, viz., an accord with Italy on the[10945]
subject of a multi-lateral assurance for safeguarding&apos; Austria^ frontiers and the promotion of the proposed Eastern Pact in a form which would secure the adhesion both of Poland and of Germany. This part of M. LavaFs statement held very closely to the lines of his recent speech in the Senate. M. Laval added that France had recently received assurances from Poland going to show that under certain conditions Poland gave her assent in principle to the continuance of the negotiations.Sir John Simon replied that Britain had every sympathy with those objects of French policy (as, indeed, we had already shown), but that we were seriously concerned at what might happen during the lapse of time which would be likely to take place before they were achieved. We appreciated the influence which French public opinion was bound to exert over the conduct of French foreign policy, but there was also British public opinion to be considered. The National Government ought not to be regarded as so firmly established that it could disregard British public opinion; and British Ministers were bound to point out that after their recent demarche about the figures of German rearmament, and after the important part which Britain had played in connexion with the Saar and the Yugoslav matter, the British Government would certainly be expected to exploit the opportunity and promote agreement about armaments while the conditions were good for the purpose. Looking ahead, he foresaw the possibility, if nothing effective was promptly done, of a grave reproach being-addressed to the British Government on the ground that they had failed to make use of the opportunity until Gei-many&apos;s claims had risen yet higher and agreement had become impossible. Already Germany&apos;s claims went beyond the formula of the 16th April; for example, Germany now had bombing aeroplanes, which last April she renounced. Moreover, he invited French Ministers to consider the probable action of Germany as soon as the Saar question was settled. Would not Herr Hitler then come forward himself with proposals to settle the armaments question and invite the rest of us to negotiate with him on the subject? It seemed likely that Herr Hitler Avould do so. That would give him the initiative, and it would be impossible then for the British Government to delay or hesitate, for British public opinion would insist on our own policy in the matter being promptly declared. Therefore, it was really essential that there should be a proper consultation between the British and French Governments now, for the last thing that we wanted was to take a public course which had not first been fully discussed with the French Government. Sir John emphasised that he was not suggesting that any communication should be made to Germany before the Saar question was settled, for the time-table would not admit of it. AVhat he was urging was that there should be an early meeting of French and British Ministers to consider the subject beforehand.At this point the French Ministers consulted in private, and M. Laval then said that the French Government fully appreciated and sympathised with the arguments which had been used. They admitted that the position taken up on the 17th April could no longer hold. The French Foreign Minister said that he was ready to go to Rome immediately in order to carry through the outline of an agreement about Austria, if only Sigrior Mussolini could be got to agree in principle to a suitable scheme. This Austrian question, M. Laval said, must come first, both for reasons of French domestic policy, and in view of their relations with the Little Entente, but the French Government were prepared to agree that the negotiation of the Eastern Pact and other matters should be regarded as postponed to a later date, and should be taken up in combination with, and not before, discussion with Germany of agreement about armaments. Consequently, if we could help him by using our own influence with Mussolini, which he rated very high, for promoting a Franco-Italian agreement about Austria, the French Government would agree here and now that this should be immediately followed by a visit of the two Ministers to London for the purposes of a. conference before the date of the Saar plebiscite.Sir John Simon thanked M. Laval warmly for the advance he had made, which recognised the main point which Sir John had come to emphasise, viz.. the urgency of prompt consultation between British and French Ministers. But, in view of the imminence of the Saar plebiscite, the practical question of a time table now presented itself.   How soon did M. Laval think he could go to
Rome? How long did he expect to be there? If all went well, what was the sort of date when M. Flandin and he could come to London? As for any influence which the British Government could exercise in Rome to promote an agreement about Austria, this&apos; was a thing which the Government in London would certainly be willing to do their best about, it being always understood that what was proposed did not involve any fresh commitment for the United Kingdom. (M. Flandin had to leave about this point for the debate on the wheat scheme, which was just resuming. He said that M. Laval had his full authority and support in everything that he was saying.)M. Laval repeated that he was ready to start for Rome immediately, and that, as regards time table, he would be quite ready to get back in order to accompany M. Flandin to London about the 7th or 8th January, bearing in mind that the quarterly meeting of the Council of the League would begin at Geneva about the 11th.Some discussion then ensued on two points :  (1) As to the extent of the programme at the forthcoming London meeting; and(2) As to the nature of the guarantee as regards Austria which France wished to promote, and the best line for the United Kingdom to take in endeavouring to influence Mussolini to accept it.As to (1), it was agreed that the discussions in London would not be solely about German rearmament, but that associated questions would also have to be thoroughly discussed; in fact, the object would be to survey the whole European field. As for (2). M. Laval said that Signor Mussolini had originally declared himself to the Comte Chambrun as favourable to the idea of a multilateral guarantee, including Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. But Signor Mussolini had since withdrawn from that position. M. Laval complained that Italy changed its point of view on this matter continually.M. Laval said that France was quite prepared to see Roumania left out of the original arrangement. The French plan essentially involved a guarantee by the limitrophe States, but there might be a door left open by which others, e.g., Roumania, could afterwards accede. In reply to a question from Sir John Simon, he said that by a guarantee he meant that the frontiers of Austria would be secured, if necessary by force of arms, against anyone who sought to interfere with them.Mr. Campbell, who had recently returned from Rome, pointed out that the view was strongly held there that so extensive a guarantee by the limitrophe States would only serve to reinforce Nazi influence in Austria. It was held in Italy that if Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were included as guarantors, Austria would react by becoming more German than ever.M. Laval did not seem to think that this objection was so strong, but the question of the exact form of the guarantee was not further pursued in the conversation.Finally, Sir John raised the question whether it was correct to assume that in this particular matter London could greatly influence Rome. This was not like the case of the Saar, where we could press Italy to provide a contingent because we were providing one ourselves. Here we should only be offering advice without ourselves making any contribution. M. Laval expressed with the utmost confidence the view that our own advice in this matter would be effective and practically decisive. Without necessarily accepting this view. Sir John said that we would certainly lend to France what aid we could, and added that it seemed to him that the most effective argument to address to Signor Mussolini would be on the following lines: Once the Saar question is out of the way, Germany, encouraged by success, is likely to turn elsewhere, and is it not towards Austria that she will turn? It is therefore very desirable to provide in advance against the dangerous situation that might arise. This could best be done by rapidly securing a fresh multilateral declaration in support of Austrian integrity. Moreover, it might be pointed out to Signor Mussolini that the United Kingdom Government intended to follow up its recent action in connexion with German
armaments, in consultation with France and Italy, at the earliest possible moment with the object of getting Germany back to Geneva and arriving at an agreement about disarmament before the situation hardened, as it certainly would, if things were allowed to drift. M. Laval entirely agreed that this was the most effective line to take and the interview ended with expressions of mutual satisfaction as to its usefulness, and an agreement as to the terms of a communique- of the most exiguous and unenlightening character.o
