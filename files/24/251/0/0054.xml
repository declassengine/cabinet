TRJT)f!!I^MT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC.^AJBSTY&apos;.S ^GOVERNMENT). SECRET.CP.279(34). Copy No.MamPXaadiim..fev^ke..ag^mia y of State for India.With a view to our discussions on Item 7 of the Cabinet Agenda, I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a copy of a telegram which I have received from the Government of India, dated 29th November, giving their general view of the Report of the Joint Select Committee.I have also received from each provincial Governor by telegram the views of his Government on the Report. These telegrams, however, have been devoted to raising points of detail (somewhat in the nature of Committee points on a Bill) in relation to individual recommendations and, as they are moreover of considerable length, I have not thought it necessary to trouble my colleagues with them.    I need only say that all the Provinces have (either in substance or in terms) supported the proposition that the Joint Committee&apos;? Report should be taken as the basis of the proposed Bill.3rd December 1934.S .H.
Copy of telegram from the Government of India, Reforms Department, to the Secretary of State for India, dated 29th November, 1934.XXXIMPORTANT.2353.   Reforms.   Your telegram of the 20th instant, 2758.    The report of the Joint Select Committee agrees so nearly with the White Paper that v/e do not think any useful purpose would be served by referring either to difference between the two, of which you are well aware, or to views we have expressed in correspondence.We are all of the opinion that constitutional scheme recommended in report provides a sound foundation on which to frame a Bill which we consider will he workable.   But for reasons so clearly stated in paragraph 27 of the Report, we must emphasise the part of importance v/e attach to scheme as a whole and particularly to introduction of an all-India federation brought into operation at the    earliest possible elate after establishment of provincial autonomy.We agree with paragraph 273 of the Report that provincial autonomy should not be deferred for financial reasons.    Unless there is a set-back, which v/e hope unlikely, financial conditions should be such as to permit the introduction of provincial autonomy as soon as other administrative arrangements are sufficiently advanced.   But it is unlikely that there will be surplus funds to spare and rigid economy will be necessary alike at the Centre and in the provinces.Our only other observation of a general character is to express the earnest hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will do their utmost to secure the passage of
2.the Bill as soon as possible.    It is of the greatest importance that India should be given no excuse for feeling that the measure of reform now being given is not being given sincerely.On particular matters arising out of the Report which, in our opinion, merit attention before the Bill is presented, we shall address you either in our comments on draft Bill or separately.
