COMMITTEE ON GERMAN RE-ARMAMENT t REPORT,(For previous Report see G,P;   295 (-54), )1.&apos;    The Ministerial Committee on German Re-armament has held two meetings since the Debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday,  28th November, when we made public to the world the fact (and at the same time  told Germany directly) that we were aware cf German re-armament.      These meetings were held in order to consider what our policy should now be and, also,  in order to determine the action which could best be taken now to further this policy in order not to let slip the opportunity we had created for a resumption of negotiations, having as their ultimate aim the return of Germany to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conf ere nee.2.      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs formulated in the Cabinet some weeks ago three questions, vis.  -(a) Are we prepared to contemplate the legalisation of Germany&apos;s armaments?(b) If we are not prepared to do so, what is our line going to be when Germany either demands their legalisation or announces that she has armed in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and intends to continue to disregard the Treaty?(c) If we are prepared to legalise German re-armament, what are we to say to the French, and when and how are we to say it?3.      As a result of discussions on these and other questions certain recommendations were submitted to ana approved with slight amendment, by the Cabinet&quot;, at their meeting heldSECRET. CP.   302 (34).x Cabinet 46 ( 34), Conclusion 3.. -1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT. )
on 12th December, 1954, in the following form:-&quot;(a)    That an approach should be made to France at the earliest possible moment.      This approach should take the form of an invitation to M.  Flandin to visit this country and to hold discussions with us.(b) That we should not, at the present stage, have any detailed discussions with the Italians, though the Italian Government should be informed of our invitation to M. Flandin and the general tenor of the luatters which it is proposed to discuss. Great importance is, however, attached ultimately to agreement between France, Italy and the United Kingdom in dealing with this question.(c) That in the discussions with M. Flandin the actual method of approach must be elastic and the sequence in which the various matters are developed can best . be decided in the light of circumstances at the time.      The following points, however, are considered of first importance in these negotiations:-(i)   An attempt must be made to get theFrench Government to face the actual facts and, particularly, that it would appear impracticable to expect Germany to scrap what she is in process of building up in regard to armaments, in order that a fresh start might be made in a new agreement.(ii)    It is considered that the situationvis-a-vis Germany must be taken as it is to-day, bearing in mind that the return of Germany to the League and to the Disarmament Conference is essential for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe.(iii)    In developing the question of Germany1s return to the League, we should put forward our view that, while we do not in any way condone Germany&apos;s action in leaving the League, we can conceive of no real basis for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe so long as Germany remains outside.(iv) The point should be made that we are fully convinced of the illegality of Germany&apos;s re-armament but it is considered to have reached the stage when its re-cognition has become inevitable and to press strongly the point that it is far better that this re-armament should be controlled than that it should remain uncontrolled.(v) If   the French Government should raise the point that Germany has, in fact,  succeeded by a policy of blackmail, we should not per-haps dissent but we should ask France what are the alternatives.
(vii)    A particular point to be made is that it is not proposed to legalise what Germany has done, but rather to recognise the fact of her re-armament up to date;    but there should be no question, at present,  of recognising any further developments before and until the whole matter is negotiated at Geneva.(viii) If a Convention can be negotiated at Geneva on the lines suggested above, it is on the clear understanding that it will only replace those clauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles which are directly affected. This would mean, for example, that the clause dealing with the Demilitarised Zones would not be a matter for discussion.(ix)    The possibility must always be faced that Germany will not be prepared to accept the suggestions put forward.      This would be serious, but not more serious than the present situation developed as Germany means to develop it.(x)    That if, during the course of the negotiations Prance should raise rights under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, it could be pointed out that while it would appear extremely unlikely that this Article would ever be enforced, it might be possible, by international agreement, to arrange for a system of inspection to which Germany herself has not objected, provided it is of general application to all countries.&quot;4.      Following the Cabinet meeting last Wednesday, the Committee held a further meeting to examine a more detailed paper drawn up by the Foreign Secretary analysing the probable attitude of various powers on the above subject and suggesting propositions to govern our impending discussion with France. These propositions were ultimately cast by the Committee in the following form.5.      The main objective in the discussions with France (and(vi)    Germany will certainly demand equality of rights and may conceivably not be content with the idea of the status quo.      We should recognise nothing to begin   with beyond what has been done, but in negotiating the Convention Germany should be in the same position as the others in upholding what figures she thinks she requires to be inserted in the Schedule.      If, for example? it was considered that the figures inserted by Germany would be likely to menace our security or the security of Prance, then we should strongly challenge them, but if it should be possible to get an agreed schedule, then this schedule would.,  in fact, be itself a guarantee cf security because the Powers concerned would be satisfied that none of the figures accepted for any other country were a menace to their security.
with Italy, later on) ought to he the return of Germany to the League and some limitation of Germany&apos;s armaments,  and for this the price which Germany will ask should be paid will be the immediate implementation of Germany&apos;s claim to equality of status;    she may also demand some &quot;common upper level&quot; for the armaments of all European great Powers.      In other words, we must be prepared to   face   the necessity of legalising her re-armament by cancelling the relevant parts of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles.6.      But to achieve this objective and to pay this pricewill require international agreement,  and to reach this we shallhave to face and deal with a number of demands from both sideswhich may involve Great Britain too in certain concessionsand undertakings.      First, we must settle with France theterrns on which she will concede equality of status to Germany,and then we must induce Germany to accept these terms, our ownparticular concern being Germany&apos;s return to the League andsome limitation of her armaments.7.      Thus it looks as though a v/hole series of reciprocal undertakings will have to be given concurrently by the different parties, and these will presumably have to be negotiated outside Geneva,  since Germany&apos;s return to Geneva will be precisely one of these undertakings, and it is hardly likely that she would give effect to it in advance of the undertakings to be given by the other parties^).8.      The terms which Great Britain and France (in association with Italy, as necessary) would demand would seem to be:-(a)    Germany&apos;s return to the League and to the Disarmament Conference.(*b)    Germany&apos;s accession to an Eastern Pact, or its equivalent.(1) In some cases,  such as the fixation of the limits ofGermany&apos;s future armaments and the conclusion of inter-national pacts (see below) the actual carrying out of the undertakings given could perhaps take place at a latter date and possibly at Geneva.-4-
(c) The Limitation of Germany&apos;s armaments, if still possible,  to the figures given in the German memorandum cf the 16th April, plus some under-taking regarding the German navy.(d) Germany should join with the United Kingdom, Prance and Italy in the Declaration with regard to Austrian integrity and independence of the -17th February, 1934,9.      It seems also highly probable  that prance will demand the establishment of that &quot;regime of security&quot; which is provided for in the Declaration of 1932 on Germany&apos;s equality of status,10,      Our first object should be to try to get France to regard Germany &apos;s accession to an Pastern Pact, or its equivalent, and also the return of Germany to the League and the Disarmament Conference as satisfying the conception of security above referred to,      In regard, to the latter, while each country would be free naturally to put in its own figures., we should refuse to accept figures for Germany which might be considered either a menace to the security of Prance or ourselves, cr to the peace of Europe,      The acceptance, if it should be possible, of Germany!s schedules by Prance and ourselves would,  therefore, be the proof that the scale of Germany&apos;s armaments, in proportion to those allotted to Prance ana ourselves, dees not constitute a menace to security,II,      If the French Government can be persuaded to accept such a settlement,  ice.   the grant of Germany&apos;s equality cf status in return for Germany accepting the Franco-British demands formulated in paragraph X above,  then the next tiling would be to get Italy to co-operate and, after that, a joint proposal can be made to Germany on these lines.12,      It   may.  however, prove impossible either to get france to accept these proposals or, alternatively,  that if Francedoes accept them, we may find that Germany will prove-5-
obstructive.      Should either of these situations arise, it will be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider whether they can make any contributions of their own in order to secure a settlement.13.      The sort of contributions which Great Britain might possibly make would primarily be measures which would ensure British security, but which could and would be re-presented as constituting valuable contributions to European and French security.      For instancej-(a) A British declaration, in which it would be most desirable for Italy to join, interpreting our obligations under Locarno to the effect that a flagrant invasion of, or attack upon, the territory of Belgium, would automatically be   considered by Great Britain as an unprovoked act of aggression requiring Great Britain to come immediately to the help of Belgium,  in accordance with Part 3 of Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno, and that this help should be given by all the means in her power (cf. unofficial discussions last summer with the Belgian Government on this subject).      Italy would be much more likely to be prepared to subscribe to such a declaration if it constituted only a part of a general scheme for the pacification of Europe.(b) A re-affirmation that Great Britain still considers the demilitarisation    of the Puiineland as a vital British interest, and will treat it as such in accordance with the Treaty of Locarno.      (it should be noted, however,  that consideration might have to be given to the question of allowing Germany to mount anti-aircraft guns in the de-militarised zone in the Rhineland.)(c) A declaration of what might be called &quot;the British Monroe doctrine&quot;, to the effect that Great Britain would consider any attempt to interfere with the independence or integrity of Belgium as dangerous to her peace and security.(NOTE. From our point of view the maintenance of the integrity of Holland is of equal importance to that of Belgium, for Germany could use Holland as an air base against us without touching Belgium. From this point of view, Holland is of less interest to France.      It is probably better, therefore, to leave Holland out of the considerations at this stage,  though there are certain very important points which will require careful consideration by us in due course,)
(d) A declaration to the effect that the violations of the frontiers of Belgium and Prance, as dealt with in Part 3 of Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno, are considered by Great Britain to apply equally to violations by air as well as by land.(e) As the German threat to Austria and Italian-German rivalry in the Danube Basin must be recognised as one of the main causes of insecurity in Europe to-day,  its elimination would certainly contribute to the creation of the desired &quot;regime of security&quot;. Up till now we have hoped that the problem wouldbe solved by direct agreement between Prance and Italy, but the prospects of immediate progress in this direction are not improving.        It is for consideration, therefore, whether something might not be done by a direct British initiative with the object of trying to negotiate a settlement of the Austrian problem on the basis of a joint guarantee of Austrian independence by all her neighbours.     This would not involve any direct commitment by His MajestyTs Government;    it wo uld merely be an attempt on their part, as the chief disinterested Power, to eliminate this cause of friction.14.      If, as we believe, the object at stake is nothing less than the future peace of Europe,  it will be well worth while for Eis Majesty!s Government to consider very carefully whether the time has not come to make some direct contribution on the abox^e lines to put an end to the present fatal drift towards chaos and war.      It may well be that the issue in the coning negotiations will depend on the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter^,   and if these negotiations result in a deadlock between Prance and ourselves, we must face the fact th t the situation will have been aggravated and the danger to peace increased.   ;   Hitler will,  in that case, emerge as the only beneficiary.     His policy of defiance will have justified itself, and the initiative will definitely have passed from our hands to his.      In such circuru-stances we may vet be driven, for the sake of British13security, to take the measures indicated in paragraph 13-but it will then be too late for us to get in return for them on agreed settlement of the German re-armamentproblem.na
15.     It is realised that some of these conclusions may be debatable.     For example, in paragraph 7,it may he questioned whether Germany will merely demand legalisation of her armaments up to date.     She is more likely to require to be given complete freedom to re-arm fcorresponding to the freedom of both France and ourselves) as a condition of (i) returning to Geneva; and (ii) there negotiating limits for all of us; that is to say, she will want freedom for more armaments and insist that any limit hereafter set to her re-armament is accompanied by a reduction of French armaments.16.      If it is found impossible to get any agreement with Germany, it may be necessary for us to consider the question of consultations between the French, Belgian and/^General Staffs with a view to   ensuing that the three Governments can carry out effectively their obligations under the Treaty of Locarno. Such consultations, if considered desirable, might bemust be regarded, however, as an alternative only to be taken into account if no agreement with Germany is found to be possible.17.     The main object, both for international reasons and for reasons of domestic politics in this country,  is that germany should he got back to Geneva.       The proposals set out abovesuggest a method of approach and procedure.      In handling thediscussions with the French in the first place, and later,perhaps, with the Germans,  if that stage is reached,flexibility in negotiation will be essential.     The proposals set out above are intended to form a general guide for this purpose.     They mayhot necessarily be taken in the order in which they are set out and it is conceivable that details may have to be adjusted to.Qieet situations as they may arise. The matter will requirethe most delicate handling and, although from many points ofview it is desirable that the negotiations with France should be pressed on with as quickly as possible, there are indications (2)&quot;.Hitler has&quot;invited us to make a defensive alliance with France.-8-communicated to and approved by Germany(2)This possibility
that France will take the view that no really substantial progress can be made until the Saar plebiscite is cleared out of the way.hitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 18th December,  1934.

Each committee will, in addition, include nationals of other States.While the committee is proceeding to the local inspection in the territory of a State, the representatives of such State shall cease, temporarily and until the inspection is finished, to sit on the committee.On the other hand, the State undergoing inspection shall name one or more assessors who shall accompany the committee during such inspection. These assessors shall be constantly at the disposal of the committee in order to facilitate the accomplishment of its task. The committee shall not refuse them the right to be present at its investigations.(c) The chairmanship of the committee shall be assumed by each of themembers in turn.   The rotation will be determined by drawing lots. id) The committees will draw up the program of each investigation in conformity with the instructions given them by the commission.

When help is required from these authorities it shall be requested through the intermediary of the assessors representing the State under inspection. These assessors must be provided with written instructions giving them all necessary powers for this purpose.Article 27.Any high contracting party shall be entitled to request the commission to conduct in its territory such investigation as may be necessary in order to verify the execution of its obligations under the present convention.On receipt of such a request, the commission shall meet at once in order to give effect to it and to determine the scope of any such investigation, and to lay down the conditions in which the investigation is to take place; it being under-stood that the commission may decide not to hold such investigation if the high contracting party making the request is satisfied with the results of the commission^ deliberations.Article 28.If one of the high contracting parties is of the opinion that the provisions of the present convention have been infringed, such a party may address a complaint to the commission.The commission shall meet at once to consider the matter, and will invite the high contracting party, whose attitude towards the fulfilment of its obligations has produced the complaint, to supply it with all the explanations which may be useful.Should the commission determine that the complaint is of such a nature as to warrant a special investigation, its decision to conduct the investigation on the territory of the high contracting party in question must be taken by a two-thirds majority of all members of the commission, whether present at the meeting or not.The special investigations provided for in the present article shall be carried out by a special committee created for this purpose.
