IgST, SECRET.. In.P. 238(54)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.C A B I N E T .COP^MO.     $THE NAVAL CONFERENCE n 1955.REPORT ON TILS PRELIMINARY NAVAL DISCUSSIONS ggJCCH HAVE TAKEN PLAGE WITH THE JAPANESE REPPESSPTATxVES.At the opening of the proceedings the Japanese representa-tives read a document setting forth the principles on which their plan is based.       The text of this document is as follows :-&quot;To pposoess  the measure of armaments necessary for national safety is a right to which all nations are equally entitled. In considering the questionof disarmament,  therefore, due regard must be given to that right in order that the  sense of national security of the various Powers might not be impaired; and any agreement for the limitation and reduction of armaments must be based on the fundamental principle of &quot;non-aggression and non-menace&quot;.To that end, we believe that the most appropriate method in the field of naval disarmament is for us, the leading naval powers,  to fix a common upper limit which may in no case be exceeded, but within which limit each Power would be left free to  equip itself in the manner and to the extent which it deems necessary for its defensive needs.It is desirable, that this common upper limit should be fixed in the agreement as low as possible,  and that offensive arms should be reduced to the minimum or abolished altogether in favour of essentially defensive arms so as to facilitate defence and to render attack difficul t&quot;.At a later stage of the proceedings, the Japanese represent a-tives indicated that the purpose of their formula might be briefly summarised as :(l)    to fix a common upper limit3(2)    to set up the principle of &quot;non-aggression and non-menace&quot; by the  abolition or reduction of offensive arms;    and(3)    to leave to each country the right to build within that limit in the manner which it deems most fit.In the course of the two full meetings aid of the sub-committee meeting which have taken place it was established
by a process.of questioning that the practical application of the above formula is envisaged by the Japanese as follows : -The most vital and essential point of the plan is the fixing of a common upper limit of total tonnage for all naval Powers, this limit to be determined by the Power which considers itself to be the most vulnerable and therefore to have need of the largest navy. In the -Japanese view it is unlikely,if the principle of &quot;non-aggression raid non-menace&quot; is generally accepted;, that the less vulnerable Powers would in fact build up to this common upper limit, but they are to have the right to do so should they so d osire. By v. ay of example,  it wasmade clear that Japan could not in advance limit her navy to a percentage of the total  tonnage figure of the British navy. So strongly does Japan feel on this question that she will denounce the Washington Treaty if international agreement on this basis cannot he obtained.The second vital point is the abolition of the aircraft carrier and,  if possible, also of the capital ship;    and a. drastic reduction   in numbers - even abolition - of the 8&quot; gun cruiser. These three types of vessels are considered   by japan to be essentially offensive. Should it be impossible to secure agreement for abolition, it is proposed that these three types of vessels should be drastically reduced in numbers and should he separated by categories as at present, Vessels which the Japanese plan classes as essentially defensive are; the 6&quot; gun cruiser, the destroyer and the submarine, and these should he merged into a single category with complete liberty for each Power to build as it chooses. Should it prove impossible to secure general agreement for the grouping
of these classes in a single c ategory, the Japanese Government would reluctantly agree to the retention of a separate c ategory for submarines but would hope at least to retain a single category for 6&quot; gun c misers and destroyers.As regards sises of ships and guns,  the Japanese representatives gave certain tentative indications as to their attitude, but emphasised that this information was furnished subject to  the general adoption of the proposed common upper limit and would no longer hold good if the idea of this common upper limit were to be rejected. The information thus given is to the  following effect :-Capital Ships.      Failing abolition,  8,000 to 30,000 dons displacement with a 14&quot; gun.Aircraft carrier.    Failing abolition, 20p00 tons with a 6.1&quot; gun.Cruisers.       Would wish to retain a few 8&quot; gun cruisers if capital ships are abolished or if aircraft carriers are retainedotherwise would a gree that this class of ship should be allowed to die out.6&quot; gun Cruisers.      Would agree to numerical limitation of large 6&quot; gun cruisers.     Would put maximum displacement for all other 6&quot; gun cruisers at 5,000 tons.Destroyers and Submarines.    Would agree to maintain London Naval Treaty displacements and gun calibres, if separate categories for these two classes of vessels are retained.        It was also ascertained that, if the capital ship and the aircraft carrier   are to be retained, Japan would demand 120,000 tons of submarines (as compared with 52,700 tons under the London Naval Treaty).In the course of the discussion the United Kingdom representatives drew attention to the difficulties inherent in the Japanese plan.      They pointed out that  the British Empire, with its huge areas to protect, its long lines of-3-
communication and its diverse responsibilities, was in an especially vulnerable position.      The Japanese represen-tat ives had admitted that an equality in security or risk might require some inequality in tonnage   yet the Japanese proposals apparently contemplated that a country with world-wide responsibilities would be placed at this common upper limit, whilst other countries, with less wide res-responsibilities, might build up to the same limit.      State A, with her world-wide responsibilities, would have her maximum naval strength fixed at the common upper limit, while State B with admittedly less responsibilities would have latitude of movement to build up, if she thought fit, to the same limit.      If State B in fact used her power to build up to the limit. State A, which was debarred from exceeding the limit, could not be indifferent to the action of State B.      The Japanese plan, by fixing the limit in the case of State A, fettered the liberty of action of that State while giving liberty of action, within the limitj to State B and other States which may become aggressive to A.      In other words, if the British Empire, with world-wide responsibilities, agreed to be fixed at the common upper limit while other States were free to build up their strength to that limit,  the safety of the British Empire against attack will ao longer exist.      The naval needs of any particular power were both absolute and relative so that  the size and composition of one navy must necessarily influence those of another.      In the circum-stances the United Kingdom representatives enquired whether, once agreement had been reached on general principles, the Japanese plan contemplated that programmes of future naval construction should be exchanged between the various Powers and, if possible, agreed in advance.The grounds on which the retention of the capital ship has been considered, in relation to the British-4-
strategical position, 10 uo an essentially defensive weapon were fully explained to the Japanese representatives, and it was pointed oat that the abolition or the capital ship, far from decreasing car vulnerability, would greatly increase it.The answer given by the Japanese representatives on the above points was to the following general effect:while it was recognised by Japan that the security of national defence might depend to some degree upon the armed strengths of the various lowers as well as the size of territory and length of coasts and trade routes, it appeared to the Japanese representatives that the state of international relations and such domestic factors as natural resources and industries had an important bearing on the question of security.      But these factors were so varied and complicated in the different countries that it would be impossible to convince the Powers of the propriety or advisability of employing such factors as the basis for determining the quantity of arms to be possessed by each. It was for this reason that Japan had finally developed the plan now embodied in her proposals, which contemplated that all naval powers would have to make sacrifices but naturally the stronger naval Powers (the United Kingdom and the United States of America)  would be expected to make larger sacrifices than the weaker naval powers.      In the view of the Japanese delegation the ratio of naval strength fixed by the Washington Treaty was injurious to the prestige of japan, who objected to the theory that her naval require-ments were less than those of other powers.Japan fully recognised the special position of the United Kingdom and the reasons, based on her worldwide responsibiliti es/
for the United Kingdom&apos;a naval requirements.    But Japan&apos;s position must be considered in relation to the position or the United States,  a highly concentrated, well developed country, with almost inexhaustible  resources in regard to raw materials and productive capacity.    Japan,  on the other hand, consisted of islands spread out over a large area and was dependent in the main for her raw materials on her imports from overseas.      If the two countries were compared, the vulnerability of the United States of America was insignificant  compared with the vulnerability of Japan.It was true that the United Kingdom would have little power of movement at  the common upper limit, but where that common upper limit was to be fixed was,  of course, an entirely separate question and,   so far as Japan was concerned, it might be fixed as high as the United Kingdom wished.      Japan, however,  definitely objected to the continuance of the position of inferiorit.   fixed by the Washington Treaty.    If tne provisions relating to the abolition or substantial reduction of offensive weapons could be carried, out the degree of vulnerability of particular nations would be greatly reduced.      On this basis,  even if all the more important naval Powers build up to the common upper limit, there should be no question of increasing the vulnerability of any particular power.On the question of discussion and agreement upon programmes, the Japanese representatives at one time expressed their belief that agreement on a building programme would in due course be reached in discussions with other interested nations, but at a later stage it was&apos; stated that it  would be difficult to announce these limitations in advance in every case.

Under the

On the other hand, Pear-Admiral Yamamoto mentioned that Japan would, not necessarily &quot;build up to the upper limit,  though she must retain the right to do so.(3)    It will be seen that this docs not necessarilyexclude the possibility of Japan ultimately accepting the idea of a &quot;Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement&quot; or &quot;Voluntary Declaration&quot; in relation to future naval construction once the prestige point has been disposed of to her satisfaction.(4)    Japan also makes it a major- point to secure theabolition of what are to her, though not to other differently situated Powerss offensive vessels, viz5j   capital ships, aircraft carriers and 8&quot; gun cruisers, but is evidently not very hopeful that this will be possible,      Should it prove impossible, Japan would insist strongly upon a reduction in the numbers of these vesselsu      She will adhere to the
Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. , 30th October, 1934.category system in these types if their abolition cannot he achieved, but stands for merging all 6&quot; gun cruisers and destroyers into a single category.      In the submarine category Japan proposes the figure of 120,000 tons if capital ships are  retained.(5)    Japan&apos;s proposals in regard to qualitative limitation appear to be close to our own, but it was only under some pressure that  she was induced to discuss the technical questions so long as her demand for the common upper limit was unsatisfied.      She showed a disposition not to press too strongly her wish for global tonnage limitation and accommodation seems possible on this matter,,
