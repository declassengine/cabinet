THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 234 (34).CABINET.PRESENT  POSITION OF THE  DISARMAMENT  CONFERENCE.THE memorandum annexed has been prepared in the Foreign Office to show in some detail the present state of deliberations at the Disarmament Conference. The main points for consideration by the Cabinet appear to me to be the following :  (1) The prospect of securing at the present time a Disarmament Convention, i.e., a world-wide agreement limiting and reducing by number and definition the maximum armaments of every country in the world, does not exist.(2) Although this melancholy fact is everywhere recognised, the formal admission by the Conference that it cannot attain its object might have serious additional consequences. For example, article 8 of the Covenant requires that plans should be formulated for the reduction of armaments, &amp;c. If it were conceded that no plans could be formulated, that would be a direct denial of the Covenant. Consequently, some mode of postponement in the hope of trying again later on would be of practical utility. Again, the conclusion of the Disarmament Conference without result might lead Germany to disavow Part V of the Treaty of Versailles in terms, alleging that she accepted and is bound by the limitations in her own armaments only so long as the effort to reduce the armaments of others is being carried through. Whether Germany&apos;s open avowal of her disregard of a treaty which she is not observing would make matters worse may be in question; but it would certainly create a new situation.(3) Cannot some much more limited objective be reached and something saved from the wreck ? Even if this cannot be done, I am strongly of opinion that we should attempt it. Draft conventions for publicity of national defence expenditure and for the control and regulation of the trade in and manufacture of arms may not result in actual achievement, but it would make a great difference, I think, to our own position if we prepared such drafts and pressed them forward, and showed that, just as we gave the lead at the beginning of the Conference, so we have not abandoned such practical effort as is possible at the end of it.(4) There is no time to lose, for it is probable that Mr. Henderson will ask for a Bureau meeting next month.J. S.Foreign Office, October 26, 1934.The Present Situation of the Disarmament Conference.1.   There has been no meeting of any organ of the Disarmament Conference (except the Technical Committee on National Defence Expenditure) since July last.   The last meeting of the General Commission of the Conference was held on the 11th June.   A few days earlier, on the 8th June, the General Commission &quot; 7635   [10700]
adopted a resolution which laid down a programme for the future conduct of the Conference. By this resolution, the General Commission gave instructions for the constitution of certain Committees, and laid certain tasks upon the Bureau.2. Three of the Committees referred to in the resolution duly met and drafted reports before adjourning early in July. They have not met since. The subjects studied by these Committees were : (1) The form and scope of regional security agreements; (2) guarantees for the execution of a Disax*mament Convention; (3) manufacture of and trade in arms.3. The fourth Committee mentioned in the General Commission&apos;s resolution, namely, the Air Committee, did not meet, as it was considered desirable that there should be preliminaiy consultations between some of the Powers principally concerned, chiefly on the question of the control of civil aviation. The French Government suggested in July last that conversations should be held between French and British experts to see whether it would not be possible for the two Governments to reach an agreement on some form of control which would prevent the use of civil aircraft for military purposes. There has been some discussion between the two Governments as to the basis on which these conversations should proceed, but the conversations have not yet opened.4. As regards the Bureau, the duty placed upon it by the General Commis-sion was to &quot; seek, by whatever means it deemed appropriate and with a view to the general acceptance of a Disarmament Convention, a solution of the outstanding problems, without prejudice to the private conversations upon which Governments will desire to enter in order to facilitate the attainment of final success by the return of Germany to the Conference.&quot;By these words, the General Commission recognised the fundamental divergences between the French and German standpoints revealed by the diplomatic exchanges which had taken place, with the authority of the Bureau, since November 1933, and placed upon the Bureau the responsibility for seeking their solution. The responsibility of the Bureau was a point to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attached importance at the time. The Bureau has so far taken no steps to carry out this part of its mandate. It was suggested at one time that Mr. Henderson should be authorised by the Bureau to visit the chief capitals, including Berlin, but this idea was abandoned owing to French opposition. It was decided that the best course would be to allow the negotiations for an Eastern Pact of Mutual Guarantee to proceed, in the hope, however faint, that if this Pact gave the French the security they required they might be brought to agree to concede equality of rights to the Germans in a sufficiently concrete form to bring the Germans back to the Conference.5. Mr. Henderson visited Geneva for a few days early in September during the session of the Assembly, in order to consult delegates on the disarmament situation, and, in particular, as to the date upon which the Bureau might be called. He recorded his conclusions in a letter addressed to the members of the Bureau on the 12th September, in which he said that &quot; the work entrusted to the Bureau under the resolution of the 8th June could best be undertaken following on the efforts to be made by the Governments to secure a solution of the outstanding political problems.&quot; He noted that negotiations were in progress with a view to the entry of the Soviet Union into the League and the conclusion of an Eastern Pact. He also stated that other conversations were contemplated in the near future, by which he meant the visit of King Alexander to Paris and of M. Barthou to Rome. In view of this, he thought it would be undesirable to call the Bureau while these efforts were being made. He suggested that the first week in November would be a suitable date for the Bureau to meet, but proposed to proceed to further consultations towards the end of October. Since Mr. Henderson wrote, the prospects of the conclusion of an Eastern Pact have receded, and the general situation has been disturbed by the assassinations at Marseilles.6. Meanwhile, there was a further development at the Assembly itself. M. Litvinov suggested that the Assembly should express the hope that the President of the Conference would report to the Council (which meets in January) on the work of the Conference, and that the Council would express its views as to future procedure.   The Assembly did no more than take note of this suggestion;
but M. Litvinov made it clear that he would raise the question of disarmament at the January session of the Council and revive his proposal that the Disarma-ment Conference should be transformed into a Permanent Peace Conference with the duty of establishing security and watching over the maintenance of peace. He explained that it was from the Council that the President of the Conference had received his mandate, and that it was natural that after two and a half years the Council should take stock of the results of the Conference and give such new directions as might be necessary.7. While Mr. Henderson was in Geneva in September it was suggested to him by some delegations that, in view of the impossibility of concluding a general Disarmament Convention in the near future, it might be desirable to begin modestly by concluding three protocols, one on the manufacture of and trade in arms (this would be a self-contained instrument making no provision for reduction or limitation of armaments), another on publicity of national defence expenditure (in regard to which draft articles already exist), and a third for the immediate establishment of the Permanent Disarmament Commission. The duties of the Permanent Disarmament Commission would be to supervise the execution of the other two protocols, and to supplement them by further protocols on limitation and reduction of armaments as soon as this should be possible.8. The Spanish, Scandinavian and United States delegations were under-stood to look favourably on this suggestion. The Italian delegation was strongly opposed to it, while the French and Polish delegations saw little use and some disadvantage in it. It was urged in some quarters that the Germans were no more likely to sign these protocols than a general convention, unless they were accorded equality of rights in a concrete form, and that such protocols, even though they could be drafted and signed, could not be brought into force, as some at least of the signatories would refuse to ratify them until Germany and Japan had become parties. It now appears from a conversation which the Lord Privy Seal had with M. Sandier, the Swedish Foreign Minister, in Stockholm on the 17th October, that the Scandinavian Powers are for this reason not much in favour of trying to conclude instruments of this kind. M. Sandier said that he was asking himself whether, in view of this difficulty and of the probable failure of the negotiations for an Eastern Pact, the Bureau ought not now to undertake the task placed upon it by the General Commission on the 8th June of securing by negotiation Germany&apos;s return to the Conference. He tentatively suggested that Mr. Henderson and the two officers of the Conference (M. Politis and M. Benes) should be charged with this duty. M. Sandier recognised that the French would probably be opposed to this procedure, and that the Germans did not trust MM. Politis and Benes, but he thought that an effort should be made as there were signs that Germany&apos;s attitude towards the Conference and the League was now less adamant than it was six months ago.9. Mr. Henderson&apos;s intentions are not yet known, and it is likely that he will consult us before making up his mind. His advisers in Geneva will probably suggest that the Bureau should be called during the Extraordinary Session of the Assembly which has been called for the 20th November to deal with the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. Mr. Henderson is almost certain to want to call the Bureau before the Council meets in January, and a meeting called during the Assembly would be less conspicuous than a meeting called at any other time, and would be less inconvenient to delegates.Foreign Office, October 26, 1934.
