The Cabinet, at their meeting held on November 21st,1954E, agreed:-&quot;(a)    That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows:-The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,should be appointed to consider the question of German re-armament, and in particular to bring together the available facts and figures regarding such re-armament and to make definite proposals to the Cabinet as tc our future policy concerning the legalisation of German re-armament, on the lines cf the discussion summarised in the Cabinet Conclusion on this subject (Reference Cabinet 41 (34) Conclusion 2).(b) That a Special Meeting of the Cabinet should be held on Monday, November 26th, to consider the Report of the above Cabinet Committee, and that every effort should be made to ensure that copies of the Report of the Committee are circulated to the Cabinet not later than Saturday, November 24th.(c) To take note that the Prime Minister and the Lord President of the Council would confer in regard to the Government spokesman in the forthcoming Debate in the House of Commons.&quot;2.     We met accordingly on Thursday, November 22nd, 1934, when we proceeded in the first instance to examine memoranda4&apos; prepared respectively in the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry , and by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence which deals with Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries.     These memoranda contain the very latestx Cabinet 41(34), Conclusion 8. +    CP.   868 (34).
information in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s government as to the progress of re-armament in Germany,      For themost part they are of a secret nature and the information is, therefore, not suitable for publication.      They have,however, been examined by the Departments concerned andthere is attached, as Appendix I, such details as could safely be disclosed without prejudice to the sources of information.3. \7e also include, as Appendix II,  a brief resume ofPart V of the Treaty of Versailies,  showing the naval and military forces which Germany was allowed by this treat and in Appendix III is shown a very brief comparison of what German;/ is allowed and what she is reported to have.4. From the information at our disposal it is Quite clear,in the first place,  that Germany is not complying with the terms of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles.      It is, also, apparent that she is exceeding the limits which were suggested in the Draft Disarmament Convention submitted to the Disarmament Conference on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government by the prime Minister on 16th March, 1933.      It will be recalled that, in this Convention, it was suggested that Germany should be allowed an Army of 200,000 effectives, with appropriate armaments? and as regards the air, although no figure was inserted, it was clearly contemplated that she would be allowed an Air Force, however small.5.       In the German Government&apos;s statement of views of the United Kingdom Memorandum on the 29th January, 1934 (Cmd0 4559), Germany publicly announced her claim to have an Army of 300,000 men on a conscription basis.      She also claimed a defensive Air Force, excluding bombing planes, of a numerical strength not exceeding 30$ of the combined Air Forces of Germany&apos;s
neighbours, or 50% of the military aircraft possessed by France;    (in France, itself and in the French North african territories) whichever figure was the less.....      But, inqualification of this statement, Sir Eric Phipps reported on the 29th March, 1934, as the result of an interview with Herr Ribbentrop, that &quot;Germany&apos;s offer to accept modest per-centages of her neighbours&apos; Air Forces would lapse, and she would be freed from any limitation&quot; in the absence of a Convention.6.     From the information at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government it is clear that the German Government is now in a position to come into the open at any time and confront the Powers with the fact that the German Army has been expan-ded to 3 cavalry and 21 infantry divisions, with a peace establishment of 300,000 men,      It is also understood that the present aim of the German Government is to achieve a first-line strength of 1,300 machines by the 1st October,1936.7.      As a result of the evidence of German re-armament,  two reflections occur.      The first is that, if this policy is pursued without let or hindrance, the German forces which, although now defensive are developing so rapidly that they may very shortly pass the border line and become offensive, may ultimately therefore, become a menace to the peace of Europe,      They may, in fact, tend to recreate the very conditions which troubled the world in 1914 and. which it was one of the principal objects of the allied Governments in 1918, by the creation of the League of Nations, to prevent recurring.8.      The second reflection is that such German re-armament as has already taken place has had a most unsettling effect in Europe and that, whatever the professed intentions of Germany may be, she should be made to realise that she is
&quot;becoming increasingly a disturbing factor to her neighbours and that to her activities can largely be attributed the failure of the Disarmament Conference ana the general ear of suspicion which is now unhappily such a prevalent factor in international relations.9,     There is yet another aspect of the situation in germany which has a most material bearing on the whole future ofthat country1 s actions.     V/e refer to the Youth Movementin Germany.      There is ample evidence to show that theinculcation of the Nazi spirit, which has new become toGermany&apos;s neighbours a symbol of militarism, is taking placethroughout the youth of Germany, beginning with schoolchildren.     As one report, describing a meeting of the HitlerYouth Movement, says:-&quot;The children marched in with hundreds of banners on which death1s-heads figured frequently, in addition to swastikas and the sword and the spade. Songs and poems of the fiercest forms of patriotism, duly cheered, were given by a prominent school teacher.10.    The effect of this intensive propaganda, beginning, as it does, even with, the children of Germany, must inevitably produce a war psychology.     The German nation,  in fact, almost from the cradle to the grave, is being disciplined and fed on a martial spirit and, even though the German Government may and does profess that its aims are entirely pacific, and even though,  in fact, Germany&apos;s ai;os may not at present be of an aggressive nature,  it is clea?.r theit the forces of militarism which she is taking so much pains to create and foster may one day demand an outlet and will at any rate be at trie disposal of anyone who cares to use it.11.    With all these developments and with all the evidence-4-
which is availablei we feel there are many objections to continuing to ignore events in Germany.      Sooner or later we shall be bound to face the facts and, on balance, we consider that the advantage lies in facing them at the present time.12.   We recommend, therefore,  that,  in the Debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, there should be given, on behalf of His Majesty^ Government, a clear but friendly indication that we are aware of what is happening in Germany, and that we are not indifferent to these developments.      We do not consider it is necessary or desirable to state in the House much detail as regards figures but we think that, in Appendix I, there is sufficient information available and suitable to be made public for our purpose.13.    We also feel it is very important that the issue should not be allowed to develop as one between ourselves and Germany, but that it must be raised to the plane of a European issue,  . and care is also required, to avoid, as far as possible, any reference to the Par East.     We are also of the opinion that there are advantages in being able to state that we have already been in communication with the German Ambassador and also with Prance and Italy.      To do this before the Debate will enable the Government1s statement to point to definite action which has already been taken; the fact that this action has been taken will add weight to the Government&apos;s pronouncement and to the serious view they take of the situation in Germany.14.    Before actually making any communication to the German Ambassador, we felt that it would be desirable tc consult with. Sir Eric Phipps in order to obtain his opinion as to the probable effect on Germany   of the action we contemplate,
and arrangements have accordingly been made  or him to attend urgently a meeting to be held on Sunday night,  25th November, 193415.    Since we understand that the air side of this question is likely to receive particular prominence in the Debate, we recommend that,  in the Government&apos;s statement, the fullest possible details of our air expansion programme should be disclosed, particularly in respect of the maximum programme of squadrons which can be formed during the next tv/o years.     V/e have already ashed the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Air to see what it is possible to do in this respect.      Further, we are anxious that very full information should be given in respect of civil aviation.     We should like to have been able to give some hint of the proposed new Empire Air Mail Scheme which the Cabinet has already had before them (C,P. 190 (34) ). In view of the fact that the views of the Dominion Govern-ments on this proposal are not yet available and that the first reactions in South Africa have not been particularly favourable, we fear that this may not be possible.     At the same time we recommend that the statement made by the Secretary of State for Air in the House of lords on   21st November, 1934,      should be used as a bgisis for dealing with this aspect of the question.CONCLUSIONS.16.    Our recommendations, which we submit to our colleagues,may be summarised as follows:-(a)    That the evidence of German re-armament is now so formidable that we feel it can no longer be officially ignored, and that, if the situation in Germany is allowed to develop without let or hindrance on present lines, the German forces may ultimately become a menace to the peace of Europe.
(b)    That His Majesty&apos;s Government should,therefore, announce in general but friendly terms in the House of Commons on Wednesday, November 28th, 1934, that, from information in their possession, they are convinced that Germany is accumulating military forces far in excess of those permitted by the Treaty of Versailles, and are apparently aiming at fulfilling as rapidly as possible the programme which was put forward by them early this year, (vide Cmd.  4559).(e)    That it is important,  in making this statement, to ensure that the issue is kept on a European plane and is not allowed to become purely an Anglo-German consideration;    and, further, that, so far as possible, no Ear Eastern issues should be allowed to become involved.(d) That there would be a number of advantages in being able to inform the House of Commons that the German Ambassador had already been made aware of the public action which His Majesty&apos;s Government are proposing to take in regard to German re-armament;    and, also, that the French and Italian Governments should be given preliminary information.(e) That,  in order to implement conclusion (d) recorded above, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs    should be requested tc arrange for an interview with the German Ambassador and also to make suitable communications to the French and Italian Ambassadors.(f) That particular importance is attached to making as specific and comprehensive a statement as possible on the Governments air expansion programme, particularly as to the greatest number of squadrons that it may be possible to form,in the circumstances, during the next two years; and, for this purpose, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Air have&quot; been asked to consult as to the nature of the programme that can be so announced.(Intld. ) J.R.M.bdtehall Gardens, S.W.I. 23rd November,  1934.
1 *  CtiJRM,-LA._r-R. if&apos;.-Rumours have been prevalent for some time past that Germany is engaged in a large scale re-organisation of her military forces, and these rumours have seriously alarmed public opinion in this country.We believe that these rumours are founded on fact, and that Germany is at present expanding her peace-time IOC,COO long service Army to the 300,COO short service force claimc--&apos;1 by Germany during the mden conversations early in 1934.      The 300,000 peace-time Army will, v/e understand, comprise 21 infantry divisions together with some cavalry or mechanised formations.That tie re-organised and expanded Army would not be equipped with all modern weapons is incredible; in fact, we have every reason to believe that it will be.Apart from this Regular Army, it is well known that within Germany there exist numerous organisations which have had varying degrees of military training.In case of war, we believe the German Government would be in a position to raise from these sources,  considerable numbers of irregular formations to support the mobilised regular Army.Such irregular formations could not be compared, either in armament or training, to modern divisions, but they would be of undoubted value for defensive operations in case Germany were invaded.This year&apos;s Reichsheers Budget made provision for the addition of 172 million R.M., which was defended by the German Government as being necessary in view of the preparations provided for in the fiscal year 1934/5, with regard to the transformation of the Reichsheer into a short service Army.(Su i table for pub lie at ion0)AYypTvTvrnT y t
2, GERMAN AIR FORCE.His Majesty&apos;s Government have received information which leaves little doubt that Germany is at present actively engaged in creating an Air Force of considerable size and, moreover, of a considerable offensive nature.      V/hile to-day, the total number of aircraft of Service types is believed to be about 1,000, but so far as we know no Service units have yet been formed, the secrecy and feverish haste shown in the construction of aerodromes;    the doubling of the output of her aircraft industry within the last six months, together with the extent of military flying training being given not only to the members of her Air Force, but to those of her centralised air sports association, points to the intention to have within the shortest possible time an Air Force comparable in strength or even larger than that of any of her immediate neighbours.Germany&apos;s Air Budget in 1932/3 amounted to 43,343,200 Rm. and on that budget she operated commercial air lines probably second to none in Europe.      Her budget in 1933/4 - disclosed a year late - had risen to 78,348,450 Rm., and this year, 1934/5, to the surprising figure of 210,187,650 Rm.The efficiency of her commercial aviation system was wellknown, and it was not surprising, therefore,  that the disclosure of this 1934/5 Budget was the subject of consider-able comment in the foreign Press;    so much so, that the German Government voluntarily issued a statement  that this sum was required solely for the improvement and re-equipment of her commercial air lines and for the extension of her passive air defence system.In sporting and amateur aviation, which is now centralised in one large Air Sports Society and which, according to the Paris Air Agreement, may not be subsidised, the personnel are

found wearing air uniforms, aircraft flying in formation,in fact, a movement having every appearance of heing organised on military lines.      This Air Sports Society has now amembership of something like 100,000 and has been accordedthe same legal status as the S.S. and S.A., which means that they are available for the defence of the Government.3.  GERMAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY.The number of hands employed in the German aircraft industry is nearly double the number so employed a year ago, and we believe it to be about 15,000.      The rate of output of aircraft has increased correspondingly and we have reason to believe is now at the rate of between 160 and 180 a month with engines to correspond.     We estimate the total number of aircraft in Germany now to be about 2,500, of which about 1,000 are of purely service types or capable of immediate conversion to military use.      (Note; The French Minister for Air announced this number as 1,100 in the Chamber on 21.11.34).
APPENDIX IIo PART V OP THE TREATY OP VERSAILLES. MILITARY. NAVAL AND AIR CLAUSES.Army.Article 160 of the Treaty of Versailles prescribes generally the size of the Army which Germany is entitled to maintain.      The gist of this Article is that the German Army must not comprise more than:7 divisions of Infantry;5 divisions of Cavalry;and the total number of effectives must not exceed100?000 men.  including officers and establishments of depots.The totaleffective strength of officers,  including the personnel of staffs of whatever composition, must not exceed4,000.      It is also laid down that the Army should be devotedexclusively to the maintenance of order within the territory and to the  control of frontiers.There follow   three more Articles dealing respectively with certain matters of organisation, one of the most important of which, perhaps,  is that &quot;The great German General Staff and all similar organisations shall be dlssolvecl and may not be re-constituted, in any form, and, further, that the officers or persons in the positions of officers in the Ministries of War in the different States in Germany, and the administrations attaching to them, must not exceed 500 in number&quot;.A clause is also inserted relating to employees or officials such as customs officers,  forest guards,  coast guards,  etc.Articles 164 to 172 deal with the armaments, munitions and material which Germany is allowed and which are included in a table attached.

Further-more,  she hereby agrees strictly to observe the decisions of the Council of the League on this subie ct&quot;.Article 167 deals with the question of guns in fortified works,fort res scs and land or coast forts which Germany is allowed to retain except within the neutralised zones.      The amount of ammunition to be held for these guns is also stated.Article 163 also contains an important clause, as follows c-&quot;The manufacture of arms, munitions, or any war material shall only be carried out in factories or works, the location of which shall be communicated, to and approved by the Governments of the principal allied and associated powers and the number of which they retain the right to restrict&quot;.Other articles deal with the surrender of war material,e tc.It should also be noted that in Article 170 it is laid down that &quot;Importation into Germany of arms, munitions and war material of every kind shall be strictly prohibited.&apos;&apos;&quot;The same applies to the manufacture for and export to
\foreign countries of arms, munitions and war material ofevery kind&quot; . \\Article 171 entirely prohibits the use, manufacture or importation in Germany of the asphyxiating and poisonous gases, and all analogous liquids, materials or devices.
