This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, November, 1934SECRET.Copy No.61CP. 277 (34)THE CABINETTHE SAARMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY&quot;  OF STATE FOR war at their Meeting on Wednesday last, 28th November, the attention of the Cabinet 0154 was drawn to the plebiscite in Upper Silesia in 1921/22 as an outstanding example of 7284 the success of an International Force in preserving order.In&apos; accordance with the request, of my colleagues I have investigated the facts relating to the employment of an International Force on that occasion and I think that they arc of sufficient interest and importance to bring to the notice of the Cabinet, to whom I accordingly chculate the subjoined note.H.The War Office,30th November, 1934.NOTE ON  THE  EMPLOYMENT OF AN   INTERNATIONAL FORCE  INSILESIA, 1921/22Introductory1. This German border province contained a large Polish population and, in the initial discussions at Paris, the French desired that the whole of Upper Silesia should be ceded by Germany to Poland. It was finally arranged that the fate of the province should be decided by a plebiscite and this provision was embodied in the Treaty of Versailles.In September, 1919, the Poles in Upper Silesia rose against the German authorities ; the outbreak was suppressed. In January, 1920, the territory was taken over by an Allied Commission under a French President, General le Rond, and was occupied by French and Italian troops. In August, 1920, the Poles rose again and numerous acts of terrorism were inflicted on the Germans. The French troops made no attempt to put down the rising until strong representations were made by the British Government.First introduction of British Troops2. In March, 1921, the Upper Silesian plebiscite was held without any serious trouble; four British battalions were. sent to Upper Silesia from the Rhine Army shortly before the plebiscite, to assist in ensuring a fair vote. The reason for sending British troops was tho fear expressed by the German inhabitants that the French troops would show partiality to the Poles during the plebiscite. The plebiscite resulted in a large majority for Germany, with the exception of the Souch-Eastern districts. In the industrial area, however, which was the rea! bone of contention, voting was fairly evenly divided. As the situation appeared quiet, the four British battalions were withdrawn to the Rhine in April, 1921.
Second appearance of British Troops3. Owing to the divergent policies of the Allied Powers, no decision as to the partitioning of Upper Silesia could he arrived at immediately after the plebiscite. The situation rapidly deteriorated and, encouraged by the withdrawal of the British troops, a large scale Polish rising broke out early in May, 1921. The insurgents in Upper Silesia were assisted by Polish irregulars from across the border. In face of this rebellion the French troops adopted a passive attitude towards the Polish insurgents, who made themselves masters of about two-thirds of Upper Silesia and committed many atrocities against the German inhabitants. They were finally held up by a hastily raised force of. German volunteers. In spite of strong protests b3T the British and Italian Commissioners, General le Rond took no effective steps to repress the rebellion. Finally the British Government, in response to appeals from the German Government, decided to despatch to Upper Silesia a British force under Major-General Sir W. G. Heneker, consisting of 6 Battalions of Infantry, afterwards increased to 8, 1 Squadron of Cavalry and 2 Batteries of Field Artillery.Stibsequeiit action4. On the arrival of the British force in June, 1921, a bitter war was being waged between the Polish insurgents and the German volunteers. The British force was made responsible for an area some 60 miles by 30 miles, i.e., they had to control approximately 1,800 square miles. The area included several large intensely populated mining and industrial towns and a number of smaller towns. The country was covered with thick woods and forest, which added greatly to the difficulty of control. At the outset the Polish and German irregular forces were holding a fairly continuous line, and fairly large operations were launched from time to time by considerable bodies of the opponents, who were well armed with rifles and machine guns, and had a few field guns. In addition &quot;desperadoes&quot; and &quot;gunmen&quot; from outside Upper Silesia had flocked to the area, and in small bands were raiding and looting Germans and Poles impartially. The French troops declared they were powerless to prevent this state of affairs and remained passive in the towns and villages, while the fighting between the opposing forces went on outside. The Italian troops at first endeavoured to hold back the Polish insurgents but, unsupported by the French, were forced back to the River Oder, which they held with German volunteers against a further Polish advance.The British Commander was faced with great difficulties, as neither the French nor the Italians were anxious to co-operate. It was essential to separate the combatants and make them fall back the Germans to the West and the Poles to the East and force them either to vacate the province completely or to disband their forces and surrender their arms. Great firmness and tact had to be displayed by the British force combined with very careful military dispositions, as the British force was liable to be attacked by either side.Eventually a scheme for successive withdrawals was arranged with the Polish and German leaders, but it was only the discretion and tact displayed by the British troops actually in contact with the combatants, that made it possible to carry out this scheme successfully. The Germans would neither speak to nor take instructions from the French, while the Poles and Italians were equally unfriendly, and thus the British soldier became the final intermediary. The power of the British uniform to quell disorder was never more effectively witnessed. On the orders of a British lance-corporal or sentry the German or Polish outposts usually withdrew without further trouble. The Germans would stop their fire in order to allow a Bxdtish officer to ride or motor through the lines, while the Polish machine gunners would cease fire and stand up to salute on the approach of a khaki uniform or at the sight of the Union Jack. In the end the German and Polish forces were withdrawn or disbanded and order was gradually restored.Second British Withdrawal- 5. The British force was not withdrawn until June, 1922, and during the long&apos; negotiations and the handing over of parts of Upper Silesia to Poland, the presence ot British troops was the main factor in preventing fresh outbreaks. Small parties of British troops were frequently sent to assist the French troops in any operations, as detachments of British troops were never molested.The position won for themselves by the British troops was well exemplified during the last few days of the evacuation of the Allied troops, when British units were employed to protect the entraining and departure of French units.(b31/8)   70   12/34   w.o.P.   s237
