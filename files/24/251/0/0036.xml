this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government1 Q printed for the Cabinet.   November 1934. x 0 secret. Copy No.  41CP. 261 (34).CABINET.THE SAAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may like to have before them, for reference, the following note on a number of pending questions and difficulties relating to the Saar. I do not ask for any Cabinet decisions at the moment, but the situation is so difficult and anxious that it is well for us to be prepared with an outline of the facts in case sudden and special Cabinet consideration is needed, as it may be : 1. The Saar plebiscite is fixed to take place on the 13th January. By the terms of the Annex to the Treaty of Versailles, the voters have to indicate their preference between (a) Union with France;(b) Union with Germany;(c) Maintenance of the present international regime.The voting is to be taken separately in each Commune, but, apart from one or two Communes on the west, it is quite certain that the vote for uniting with France will be infinitesimal. It has always been expected that there will be a majority for union with Germany, for the Saar is German. But whereas the vote for Germany might have been 90 to 95 per cent, some time ago, it is quite possible to-day that there may be a quite substantial minority in favour of maintenance of the status quo. The most recent estimate from the German side is 30 per cent. This, of course, is due to fear of the Hitlerite regime, which is all the greater because the Saar population is Catholic, and to the influence of refugees.2. The French have no hope that the Saar will opt for France, but there has been a great deal of propaganda to induce people to vote for the continuance of the status quo. This, I consider, is a very foolish objective, for the best thing that could happen would be for the Saar to vote itself into Germany without dissent. The proof that there is a large protesting minority will only lead to trouble. The French objective of a large vote for the status quo is being pressed by two suggestions, both of which appear to be illegitimate : (a) It is being urged that before the plebiscite is taken the Council of the League should decide and announce in more detail what will be the future constitutional government of the Saar if the Saarlanders vote for the status quo. This proposal is said to be justified because it is desirable that voters should &quot; know what they are voting for &quot;; but the real purpose of it would be to try to make out that there is a bright future for the Saarlander if only he votes for the international regime. It is therefore propaganda in favour of one of the three courses. The objection to this is that the League of Nations is conducting the plebiscite and should therefore remain neutral. - (b) It is also suggested that the Council should make plain, before the vote is taken, that, if the decision is in favour of the stattis quo, this decision will not commit the Saar to the international regime for ever and that another plebiscite might take place later on. This is open to the same objection as (a), and to the further objection that the Annex to the Treaty does not contemplate a series of plebiscites, but only one, after which the future of the Saar will be definitely determined.[10782]
Both the above matters may be discussed in the coming week at Geneva, and 1 think our attitude should be to oppose both suggestions and to insist that the duty of the Council is to act with the impartiality of a Returning Officer.3. The result of the plebiscite does not automatically determine the fate of the Saar. That is decided afterwards by the Council, in the light of the voting. There may, therefore, be a very difficult and anxious period between the 13th January and the decision, especially as Germany is no longer sitting at the Council.   The main points of difficulty are two: (1) Proposals may be made to introduce into the Council&apos;s award a clause for securing the protection of minorities in the Saar if the Saar is returned to Germany. This is a very natural object, and, if it could be secured, a very necessary one. But can it be secured ? All the clauses for minority protection hitherto put in operation have been operative only because the State exercising sovereignty has accepted them and agreed to be bound by them. If Germany can be induced to agree to such clauses, so much the better. But I am advised that under the terms of the Treaty if the Council decided that the Saar should go to Germany, there is no right to impose this condition, and in any case, as I have said above, it is likely to be ineffective unless Germany consents. The result, I fear, will be either more persecution of the sort of people the Nazis do not like or an aggravation of the refugee problem elsewhere.(2) The Annex to the Treaty provides that if the Council award the Saar to Germany, thereupon Germany must pay France in gold for the mines in that area. The amount to be paid is to be settled by arbitration. If the amount so awarded is not paid by Germany within one year of the transfer, then it is to be added to reparations, and collected by the Reparations Commission! Such were the provisions ingeniously devised by the authors of the Treaty of Versailles, and the machinery is now not available. The suggestion may be made that the Council should not award the Saar to Germany until the purcnase price has been paid. But this is not what the Treaty says, and would in any case produce a political situation of extreme tension. The best hope is that by negotiation Prance and Germany will dispose of this difficulty before it becomes acute.4. There remains the matter about which I feel the greatest possible anxiety, and that is the safety of Mr. Knox, and the maintenance of order not only during the plebiscite but in the succeeding interval. Mr. Knox is exceedingly unpopular with the Nazis and with the &apos;&apos; German Front&apos;&apos; in the Saar. He is the target of constant abuse, and in that sense is a threatened man. We have sent two C.I.D. men from Scotland Yard as his personal guard, but it is very doubtful whether this is enough to secure his safety. In any case the protection which he and his house need is not easily discharged by policemen. There is, of course, no army in the Saar at all, but only a local gendarmerie which is not reliable. As regards the maintenance of law and order over the plebiscite period, Mr. Knox has therefore been driven to recruit a small force of police, some few of whom have been recruited outside the territory. It is very doubtful whether the force is enough to deal with a well organised and sudden outbreak. Hitherto, we have taken the line that there is no question of any British troops being provided; and that the ultimate sanction for the maintenance of order is the right of the Commission (noted by the Council of the League in 1926) to call in French troops should the need arise. The German Government have strongly protested, both in Paris and London, against such use being made of the troops of one of the countries directly interested in the result of the plebiscite. Germany has given assurances that no &apos;1 Putsch &apos;&apos; would be attempted from that side. The latest telegrams from Paris indicate that France is most unwilling that her troops should be the only ones involved if troops are needed, and it is quite likely that M. Laval may decline to allow French troops to be used unless the international character of the force is shown by at least a &quot;token&quot; British contribution.We shall hear more about this when Mr. Eden gets to Geneva. I wish only to emphasise (a) that as Mr. Knox is an English official we have, whether we like
it or not, very special reasons for wishing to prevent the possibility of an outbreak; if anything happened to him, our responsibility would be grave, if we had not previously done all we could; (b) that it is very questionable if the exercise of the Commission&apos;s right to appeal to French troops might not precipitate the very crisis it is meant to avert, nor have we any certainty that the French General Staff who realise this, will, in the case of an emergency, send them in time to restore the situation; and (c) that the consequences of a break up in the Saar are so serious, and the ultimate results so menacing, that it would be far better to make sure, if we could, that nothing untoward happened now, than, by shutting our eyes to possible consequences, to give the opportunity for a calamity that might be avoided.J. S.Foreign Office, November 16, 1934.
