A.C.51Q.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.State of Trade, October. 1934.Summary of Reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.      Imports in October were  69.0iru as oompared with  61.8m. in the previous October.     Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  36.7m. against  34.1m. and re-exports of  4.0m.  against  4.6m. a year ago. The excess of imports over exports of merchandise for the 10 months ended October was  236.0m. and for the corresponding period last year,  205.1m.EMPLOYMENT.     There was a slight decline in employment during October.     The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 22nd October was 2,119,635, an increase of 37,648 as compared with 24th September.The main variations were:-The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 22nd October was 10,206,000.     This was 37,000 less than a month before, but 279,000 more than a year before.There was a seasonal decline in employment in the building and allied industries, the transport and distributive trades, and hotel and boarding house service.     There was also an increase in the numbers temporarily stopped in theLondon* 7,132 + 6,849 + 7,072 - 7,105 + 6,691 4- 503 4- 886 +15.620South Eastern South &quot;Western Midlands ....North Eastern North Western Scotland ....Wales
coal mining industry, principally in South Wales and South Yorkshire, and some decline in employment in ship-building and ship repairing, and in the hat and cap industry.On the other hand employment snowed an improvement in all the textile industries except carpet manufacture, in most of the clothing trades, in the boot and shoe, vehicle building, iron and steel, pottery and glass industries, in general engineering and in certain food manufacturing industries.ROAD AND RAIL TRAFFIC        During the 4 weeks ended 28th October railway traffic receipts increased by  253,000 (2.3$) over the corresponding period of 1933, the increase in passenger traffic being 1,9$, in coal coke and patent fuel 1.1$, and in other freight traffic 3.3$.     For the 43 weeks ended 28th October the total receipts amounted to  123,.7m.  as against  118,7m.  in the same period of 1933.MOTOR TRAFFIC,      Motor vehicles newly registered in September amounted to 18,801, an increase of 4,067 (27.6$) over a year ago.      The increase comprised 12,789 private cars and 6,012 other vehicles.      2,223 motor cycles were newly registered, an increase of 5.8$ over the previous October,.Sir-&apos;0:0ING,    The index number of shipping freights (1913 s 100)  for October was 83.85 as compared with 88.38 in September and 76.71 a year ago.      This relapse, however, does not appear to have affected the number of ships in employment.BANKING.      Money was frequently unlendable even at 5$ although the Clearing Banks adhered to their minimum of 1$. As the Treasury Bills issued so far this year are  2 0(5,000,000 less than in the same period of 1933 it is not surprising that the effort to support, discount rates has failed.      On 19th October the Banks decided not to continue
their collaboration and buying rates fell to under remaining at about ff3 for the shorter maturities for the rest of the month.     The average rates at which Treasury Bills were iss-ued in successive weeks were 15/lOd. , 14/6d, , 14/3d. and 9/7d.On the foreign exchange market sterling was weak at first against the franc and dollar, being quoted at $4.90 and F.73  but later, as a result of rumours of further devaluation in the U.S.A. and political uneasiness on the Continent it recovered and at the end of the month wasrecord figure on the llth of 143/3d. per fine ounce.      Imports of gold so far this year have exceeded exports by  116,000,000 of which the Bank of England has acquired only  1,271,000.COAL.      The average weekly output of coal during the 13 7/eeks ended 20th October was 4,171,000 tons as compared with 3,831,000 tons in the same quarter of 1933, an increase of 955.     The average number of persons- employed during this period was 762,900 as against 753,300 a year before.The home consumption of coal and coke in September was 10$ higher than a year agoc     Exports o f coal in October were 3,630,000 tons as compared with 3,555,000 tons in the corresponding month last year.     As compared with a year ago increased tonnages were again consigned to Scandinavian countries, Finland and Argentina, while exports to Italy, Egypt and Algeria also showed an improvement.     On the other hand the quantities sent to Canada, Germany and Prance showed a decline.I^Q1!^^?.^&apos;!:&apos;-3!^^     The iron and steel industry is consolidating the higher levels of activity which have ruled during the current year, although there have recently been indications of a more sluggish demand in certain districts.The price of gold reached the
The output of pig iron was 527,000 tons in Ootober as compared with 500,000 tons in September and 373,000 tons in October last year.   Business is well maintained, although it is largely confined to tonnages for near delivery.     Export trade Is unsatisfactory.Steel production was 812,000 tons against 735,000 tons in the preceding month, and 668,000 tonB in October of last year,     There is a brisk demand in the home market for semi-finished material and the demand from oertain overseas markets for finished steel has shown some expansion during recent weeks.In Scotland production has been somewhat lower than in the first half of the year, but it is anticipated that present levels will continue for the time being.     Export markets are dull.On the North East Ooast the underlying tone of the market Is confident.     More speoifications hare been reoeived for structural steel and there is a good demand from the motor-oar industry.   The export trade has shown some expansion, especially to South Amerloa.In Sheffield operations are still being maintained at a high level, and there Is a good demand from the motor and airortift industries.    The output of stainless sheets, wire rods and strip is exoeptionally large and there is an active demand for the higher quality tool steels.In South Wales there Is a more oonfident tone and output is being well maintained.   Heavy steel products are in better demand, both on home and export account.     Better conditions are reported In the tinplate market and there has been a slight improvement as regards galvanised sheets.MOTOR INDUSTPY.     Sales of private oars on the home market in September were 33$ greater than in September,  1933, the new models being favourably reoeived.Sales of commercial vehicles also showed an inorease and reflect improved Industrial conditions generally.
MAOniKE TOOLS *   The position In the home trade is still satisfactory and demand continues active.   Exports in October amounted to  128,000 as against  137,000 in September and  183,000 In August.     Exports to Russia were  32,000 in October as against  58,000 in September and  06,000 in August.   This falling off is somewhat disappointing.   Imports of machine tools amounted in October to  181,000 as against  106,000 in September.The Machine Tool and Engineering Exhibition recently held after an interval of six years was highly satisfactory and a big volume of business was transacted.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.     Business in cutlery, silver and plate is better than a year ago, the solssor and razor blade trades being particularly active.   Business In the small tool trades Is excellent.   The needle, foundry and press-work industries report good conditions, but there Is still a shortage of orders for architectural work.       Little change is reported in the look, hollow-ware and metallio bedstead trades. Most non-ferrous metal mills are working full time, but the price of copper has again fallen by a further  1 per ton owing to the increase In stocks resulting from the restriction of Imports into Germany.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.   During October 1,434 million units of electricity were produced, as oompared with 1,245 million units a year before.   For the first ten months of 1954 the increase in production over last year amounts to 16$.Orderg for heavy plant in the home trade have again shown an Increase and export orders have been maintained.   Exports of electrical machinery In October were  285,700 as oompared with  235,100 in October, 1033.     Exports of other electrical goods and apparatus in October amounted to  874,000 as against  615,000 a year ago.
OOTTON.   There was a seasonal improvement in production in Ootober.   The weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were higher than in September and there was some decrease in unemployment both in the spinning and weaving sections.     Cotton prices changed very little during the month.Spinners of medium and fine yarns had some difficulty in maintaining their margins.   Discussions are proceeding as to the adoption of price agreements in the medium Amerioan and fine American sections similar to those already in foroe in other seotions.     Plans for reorganisation were submitted to the spinning section during the month.     These are for the formation of a Ootton Spinners&apos; Association with oertain compulsory powers and for the adjustment of productive capacity to demand by the purchase and breaking up of spindles.In the weaving seotion progress has been made towards a new Btandard wage list.The export trade in yarn and cloth was not very satisfactory.   Exports of yarns were 10.8 m. lbs. as against 9.5 m. lbs, in September and 12.3 m. lbs. in October, 1933.     Exports of yarn to Germany improved ae compared with September but are well below the level of previous years.   The Argentine market shows a sharp expansion.Exports of piece goods at 176 m. square yards were 2 m. square yards less than in September, but 20 m. square yards more than in October, 1933.   As compared- with the previous month exports to India deollned, but on the other hand there was an improvement in Malaya, Oeylon and the British West Indies, while the african markets generally were also satisfactory.    Exports to Scandinavia were substantially higher, but shipments to Oentral and South Amerioa showed a decline,
WOOL.   The general aotivity of the Industry showed a further seasonal improvement during October.   The Improvement is not so great as Is normally anticipated at this time of year but it seems probable that the present rate of aotivity will be maintained for the remainder of the year.   The employment position in October   was substantially better than in September, though it is not so good as a year ago.     Raw wool prices showed very little change during the month.     Exports of wool tissues showed a decline in October as oompared with the previous month, but exports of tops and yarns Increased.chemicals.     In the alkali and heavy chemical seotlon there was a satisfactory Inorease both In the home and export trades over previous months.   Sales of dyestuffs were also well maintained.   The prioes of coal tar products have been maintained generally, but business has been rather slack especially on the export side.     The market in wood distillation products have been on the whole good, and the demand for pharmaceutical chemicals has oontinued steady.SOAP, OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.      The usual slight seasonal increase occurred in the October turnover of the margarine trade and the improvement in the butter market is giving some encouragement.   The trade In edible oils and fats was well maintained.    In raw materials there was a considerable reaction from the improved August and September conditions, but a better tone was apparent at the olose of the month.RETAIL TRADE,     The value of retail sales in September was 4.1$ greater than in September, 1933.     The principal inoreases occurred in boots and shoes (8*0%), furnishing (8.0$), miscellaneous goods (6.3$), men&apos;s and
boys1 wear (5.7$) and women1 s wear (5.4$), while pieoe goods declined by 4.9$.   In non-food departments the greatest increases occurred in Sootland and the North, while in food departments London suburbs and Scotland fared best.     Stocks showed an increase of 2.2$ over last year.   Preliminary figures for October suggest that the improvement is continuing except in the London suburbs, though there are some signs of a slowing up of business during the latter half of the month.QO-OPBRATIVE TRADE.      The Oo-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the five weeks ending 13th October shows an Increase of 8.9$ as compared with the corresponding period last year.     The weighted average of wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed a decrease of 2.64$ as compared with a year ago. Retail prices have Increased by 0.11$ on the same basis.EMPIRE TRADE.ffAWADlAfl TRADE.   The average of whole sale prices in September was slightly lower than in August.   The index of the physical volume of business showed only a slight deoline from the high August level.   After allowance for seasonal adjustments, the exports of copper and the output of lead showed improvement, while exports of niokel declined. Gold shipments fell off, but silrer showed an increase. The milling and sugar Industries were more active.   There was a deoline in the output of automobiles and the gain in wood pulp exports was less than normal for the season. After seasonal adjustment imports showed an increase of 5$ and exports an increase of 7$ over August.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     The number of bales of wool received into store between 1st July and 30th September was 958,000 against 1,036,000 a year ago.    Of these
164,000 had been sold or exported, the corresponding figure a year ago being 368,000.     Shipments of wheat and flour for the season were equivalent at 24th October to 84,000,000 bushels of wheat, against 143,000 bushels in 1933.     Exports of butter for the same period show an increase, however, from 16,000 tons in 1933 to 21,000 tons this year.      Total imports of merchandise in September were  7,860,000 (Australian currency) against  6,120,000 a year ago.SOUTH AFRICA.      Business conditions continue to be fairly satisfactory and on the whole activity remains at a high level.Exports in September amounted to  7.5m. (of which  5m, was represented by gold) as compared with  9.6 m. ( 7.4m.. go].d) in September, 1933.     Gold production in September remains at about much the same level as a month earlier, but exports of diamonds increased.     With the coming of rain in October the outlook for crops and stocks has improved materially.    Shearing is now in fall swing and a large wheat crop is anticipated. Locusts continue to cause trouble in certain areas.INDIAN TRADE.    Imports of merchandise amounted in September to 1,054 lakhs of rupees and exports to 1,207 lakhs as against 875 lakhs and 1,161 lakhs respectively, a year earlier.     The wholesale price index number in Calcutta remained at the July and August level.     Standing crops are generally in fair to good condition, but insects have done some damage in the Punjab.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.ARGENTINA.      The official trade figures for the first eight months of 1934 show an increase in value of exports of 24,5$ and of imports of 20,6$ as compared with the same period in 1933.     The 1934 figures are inflated to the extent of 20$, due to the depreciation of the peso.     Of the total value of imports for this period, the proportion from the United Kingdom has increased from 21,4$ to 23$ and from the U.S.A.  from 11.9$
to 15.1$.     During the period 29th November, 1933, to 30th April, 1934,  the total exchange created by exports v/as 537m. paper pesos, of which 39$5 has been allocated to the United Kingdom and 15$ to the United States.The general business situation is quiet.    Crop prospects continue to be favourable.     There are some 1.17m. tons of wheat available for export, but it is not thought that the carry-over will be burdensome.BRAZIL?      The business situation continues to show improvement.      Imports for the first seven months of 1934 were below those of 1933, and stocks of imported goods have fallen to a very low level.      In September the Bank of Brazil announced that all exchange arising from exports of commodities, other than coffee, could be transacted in the free market.     It also declared that 60$ of the value of drafts on all imports would be paid at official exchange and 4:0% must be acquired in the free market.CHILE.    The improvement in general conditions in the Republic continues.PERU.      Business has shown a slight decline due in part to seasonal factors and in part to labour troubles.     Exchange has remained fairly steady.ECUADOR.      Business generally is waiting the outcome of the proposals to stabilise exchange rates.BOLIVIA.      Business conditions remain unsatisfactory.
