-    250TEGUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.BBE. COPY NO, _.26&amp;(34).C A B I N E T. THE BRITISH MERCANTILE MARINE, DRAFT BRITISH SHIPPING (ASSISTANCE) BILL,Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Tradee10 The Cabinet at their meeting of the 27th June last (26 (34) 9) approved the following proposals laid before it in my Memorandum of 25th June, 1934 (CP, 161(34)):-(i) That a defensive subsidy,  to cost not more than  2 millions and aimed at bringing about the discontinuance of foreign subsidies,  should be granted for a year to British ships carrying tramp cargoes, provided that a satisfactory scheme for applying the subsidy is produced by the shipowners incorporating the conditions laid down in the memorandum,, (ii) That consideration should be given to the grant of subsidies in special cases to British liners prejudiced by subsidised foreign competition in particular trades if-the grant of financial assistance appears to be the best method of assistance, (iii) That financial assistance on lines contemplated by the Cabinet Committee should be made available by the Government for a scrapping and building scheme if and when it appears that such a scheme would be used by the shipping industry, (iv) The preparation in due course of legislation to sanction the grant of a fighting subsidy, the grant of subsidies to liners in special cases,  the grant of financial assistance for building and modernising on condition of scrapping (should this be found desirable) and the concession as to fees referred to In the memorandum, and to deal with any other relevant matters.
Subsidy in respect of the carriage of tramp cargoes under tramp conditions.2. In pursuance of these decisions, the shipping. industry has prepared e scheme for applying a defensive subsidy of  2 millions on the conditions laid down in my &quot;Memorandum referred to.      The scheme will he found in section of the attached White Paper which it is proposed to lay before the House at the same time as the&apos; Financial Resolution which v/ill be necessary before legislation can be introduced.3. The scheme is the result of several months&apos; effort on the part of the shipowners, in close consultation with my Department, to satisfy the Government&apos;s requirements.     The scheme represents the greatest measure of compliance with the Government&apos;s conditions for a subsidy which can be looked for in the conditions under which tramp shipping at present works. The proposals contain provisions for the better organisation of the industry, which were entirely absent from the original proposals for a subsidy put fory/ard last year by the tramp shipowners;    and the proposal for payment of the subsidy at a flat rate per ton,  to which general objection was taken, has now disappeared.4. Having secured the concurrence of the Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the acceptance of the Shipowners&apos; Scheme, I have caused a draft Bill to be prepared giving legislative sanction to the payment of a subsidy for the year 1st January to 31st December, 193T, in resuect of the carriage of tramp cargoes under tramp conditions in ships registered in the United Kingdom.     A copy of the Bill, which is drafted on the simplest lines,  is attached,  (see Clauses 1 *nd 2) .5.. Cargo Liner owners will come under the scheme so far as they carry tramp cargoes under tramp conditions, but so far as they carry parcels of tramp cargoes in their ordinary liner business they fear that the scheme will prejudice them.
The Liverpool group of Cargo Liner owners may oppose the scheme - they would probably oppose any scheme of subsidy -and the London group have asked for a further subsidy of  500,000 to &quot;equalise the position&quot; between them and the tramp owners.   Apart from the desirability of ascertaining how in fact the scheme will effect the liners it is clear that the grant of such a subsidy to them at the present time v/ould tend to remove their incentive to co-operate in the organisation of the tramp trade.     I am meeting on Tuesday, 27th November, representatives of the two groups of Cargo Liner Owners to explain the position. Scrapping and Building Scheme.6. So far as shipowners are concerned the position has not altered since my Memorandum of June 25 last. There is still little evidence of a favourable reception of such ascheme by shipowners, whose attitude may be strengthened by the reduction which has taken place this year in the quantity of British tonnage laid up.7.    On the other hand it is possible that the attitude of shipowners may change when they know definitely that a tramp subsidy is being paid and that some of them may then be prepared to consider the construction of new tcnnage.8.    In these circumstances, and bearing in mind the importance of providing every possible opportunity for the creation of employment,  it is for consideration whether provision for a scrapping and building scheme should be included in the present Bill, to be brought into force by an Order of the Board of Trade with the concurrence of the Treasury if and when there is a reasonable prospect of a substantial use of the facilities.9*     A copy of the White Paper issued in July 1934, which sets out the main lines of the proposed scheme, is attached
for information, and the draft Bill contains appropriate clauses. (See Clauses 3 to 6).     But, to make the scheme more attractive, I submit for approval the following alterations:-(a) That owners he required to scrap only two tons for every ton of new shipping built, and one ton for every ton of existing shipping modernised, instead of three tons in each casd as the scheme stands at present.(b) That owners be allowed to buy ships for scrapping from foreign owners as well as to scrap British ships.Financial Assistance to Liners in particular trades.10. I do not propose to suggest at present any legislative provision in respect of a grant of financial assistance in special cases to British liners (vide (ii) of paragraph 1 of this note).     No claims are before me in this respect. Concession in respect of fees paid by the shipping industry.11. A clause appears in the draft Bill to give effect to the concession approved by the Cabinet (vide (iv) of paragraph l) in respect of fees paid by the shipping industry (See Clause 8) .12. The points on which a decision is required may be summarised as follows:-(i) The introduction of the attached draft Bill to grant a subsidy of not more than  2 millions for one year to ships carrying tramp cargoes in accordance with the scheme submitted by the shipowners and to give legislative sanction to the concession as to Fees.     (Minor alterations in the draft Bill may be necessary).(ii) Whether a scrapping and building scheme&apos; on the principles indicated in the draft Bill (with the modifications shown in paragraph 9 above) and in the White Paper of July last, should be included in the Bill.W. R.H of Trade, I 26th November, 1934.
DRAFT WHITE PAPER, BOARD OF TRADEoSection 1,I4EII0RANDUH ON THE FINANCIAL RESOLUTION. Tramp Shin-ping,1. The Financial Resolution provides the necessary authority for carrying into effect the proposals with regard to tramp shipping outlined In the statement on the shipping position made by the President of the Board of Trade in the House of Commons on the 3rd July,  1934! 020 The amount of the subsidy would not exceed  2,000,000, and would be reduced below this figure if the average level of freight rates during the subsidy year rose above 92 per cent, of the average level in the year 1929 (see paragraph 14 of Subsidy Scheme in Part I of Section 2 of this Paper),3, The subsidy will be payable for a period of one year and Mill be subject to withdrawal within that period if the circumstances which led to its introduction were altered.     The period proposed is 1st January to 31st December, 1935,4B It is proposed to appoint a statutory Committee under the name of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee to advise the Board of Trade as to the administration of the subsidy, and in particular to examine claims and to make recommendations to the Board of Trade regarding them,5, The expenses incurred in the administration of the subsidy scheme by T,he Board of Trade and the Tramp Shipping subsidy Committee will be defrayed by the Tramp Subsidy Fund,      It is estimated that the total cost of administration will not exceed  10, 000.6, The President of che Board of Trade, in his statement of the 3rd July, announced that before the Government were prepared to introduce legislation in regard to a subsidy it would be
necessary for the shipowners to formulate a scheme satisfactory to the Government which would.-(i) prevent so far as possible the subsidy from being dissipated by the domestic competition of British ships carrying- tramp cargoes, and(ii) ensure that it is effectively directed to securing the greater employment of British tramp shipping at the expense of foreign subsidised shipping.7. The shipowners have accordingly submitted .a scheme to the Government containing proposals for the distribution of the subsidy,  and describing the arrangements which they intend to make with a view to promoting the better organisation of the industry and to achieving the objects of the subsidy.      The scheme is contained in Section 2 of this Paper.      The Government have accepted the scheme as fulfilling the conditions set out in the preceding paragraph.8. The President of the Board of Trade, in his statement of the 3rd July, 1934,  also laid down that the shipowners,  through their international organisations, and in any other ways open to them should press upon the shipowners in other maritime countries the framing of proposals tending to adjust the supply of tonnage in the world to the demand &amp;nd thus to raise freight, rates once more to a remunerative level.     In order to meet this condition the shipowners are taking steps to secure a meeting of the International Shipping Conference to discuss proposals tending to adjust the supply of world tonnage to the demand. ScraTping and Rebuilding.9. The Financial Resolution also provides the necessary authority for carrying into effect the proposals for the scrapping and rebuilding or modernising of British cargo vessels which were outlined in the white Paper issued in July 1934 (Cmd. 4647).      It is proposed that the scheme should be brought into operation at a date to be fixed by the Board of Trade after the necessary legislation has been passed.10. Advances made and loans guaranteed for the purpose of building  or modernising cargo vessels under the above scheme
would not exceed in the aggregate  10 million (approximately the cost of building 1,000,000&apos; dead weight tons of modern cargo ships), and no advance would he made or guarantee given after the expiration of two years from the date on which the scheme is brought into operation.11. The estimated cost of administering this scheme is  3,000. Fees charged under the Merchant Shipping Acts.120 It is proposed that the Bill shall contain provision for the repeal of Section 18 of the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926.     The result of this repeal will be that the Board of Trade will not be required to fix the fees charged for the survey of ships and other services in connection with the shipping and shipbuilding industries so that the receipts from such fees up to any date from 1st April, 1923 shall be approximately equal to one-half of the aggregate cost of administering the services in respect of which the fees are paid.13. The maximum limits of the fees fixed in earlier Acts will be restored by the repeal of this Section of the Act of 1926.Section 2. SHIPOY/ITEPS1 SUBSIDY SCHEME.
Sootlon 2.SHIPOWNERS&apos; SUBSIDY SCrTKME. Part I. Payment of Subsidy.DEFINITIONS. ETC.( l) Bllgible Ships.The subsidy -will be payable only in respect of vessels registered at a port in the United Kingdom which have been British ships since the 1st January, 1934, and new vessels built in the United Kingdom which are completed and registered after that date.Ships specially constructed for the carriage of oil in bulk, ships with accommodation for more than 12 passengers, and ships with a substantial amount of refrigerated cargo space are not within the scope qf the subsidy. (2) Eligible Voyages.(a) Character of voyage.Vessels falling within the provisions of (l) will qualify for subsidy only in respect of a voyage in the course of which all the cargo carried is carried under charter party.(b) Voyages excluded.Voyages wholly between ports in the United Kingdom, Irish Free State, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are excluded.(c) Duration of voyages.There may be included in an eligible voyage(i) time occupied In loading, carrying or discharging cargo.
(ii) time oooupied in ballast voyages -(a) to fetoh cargo booked;(b) to seek oargo in accordance with thenormal oustom of the tramp trade; (e) to pay off crew after discharging oargo; (iii) time oooupied in bunkering for (1) or (ii);    and (Iv)    time not exceeding 3 days in the voyage exclusively spent in repairing.(d) In the event of any dispute arising as to whether a voyage or any part thereof is an eligible voyage for the purposes of this scheme, the opinion of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee shall prevail.(3) Period in respect of which subsidy is payable.Payments will only be made in respect of voyages (or parts of voyages) taking place during a period of one year oommencing 1st January, 19 35.METHOD OF APPLICATION FOR SUBSIDY.(4)     Every shipowner desiring to participate in the subsidy shall register with the Committee his name and a list(including such particulars as the Committee may require) of the tramp ships owned by him In respect of whioh claims for subsidy may In his opinion arise.   Any modifications In the list must forthwith be notified by him to the Oommittee.   If the Committee are of opinion that any of the ships inoluded in suoh list are not ships In respect of whioh claims for subsidy may arise, the list shall be amended accordingly,(5)      Every owner of an eligible-ship which during any quarter of the subsidy year has oompleted an eligible voyage must, If he wishes to olaim subsidy In respect of that voyage, make application to the Committee in the manner required by paragraph (6) within a period of 21 days after the completion of the voyage .
(6) Every such application shall &quot;be in such form and Includesueh particulars and he supported by such evidence as the Committee may direct.(7)       The Committee will consider every application received from an owner in accordance with the preceding provisions and will, having regard to the provisions of the Statute and of this scheme, make such recommendation thereon to the Board of Trade   as they may deem proper.    The recommendation will be made in such form as the Board may prescribe, and will be accom-panied by such vouchers or other evidence as the Board may require.METHOD OF CALCULATING- AND PAYING- THE SUBSIDY c (8) The amount of the subsidy available for distributionamong owners will be such sum not exceeding  2 million as may be provided by the Government after the deduction of the expenses incurred in administration.    The total sum so avail-able will be distributed in accordance with the following paragraphs (9) to (13) among all owners whose claims are accepted by the Board of Trade on the recommendation of the Committee.(9) Interim payments will be made in respect of eachquarter of the subsidy year, these payments being subject to such adjustment after the end of the year as may be required under paragraph (12) below.    The total amount of the quarterly interim payments will be fixed by the Board of Trade after consultation with the Committee.(10)       The subsidy will be calculated on a basis of &quot;ton-days&quot;. (11)       For each quarter of the year, the number of &quot;ton-days&quot; to be credited to each owner whose applications have been accepted during the quarter will be ascertained.   For this purpose the number of gross register tons Included in eaoh of the accepted claims will be multiplied by the number of days included in that claim, and the sum of these products will be
taken.    The total amount fixed for distribution in the quarter will then he divided among owners in proportion to the number of ton-days credited to each, subject to any adjustments, if necessary, in accordance with paragraph (13). (12)       After the end of the fourth quarter the proportion of the total subsidy for the whole year which is payable to each owner will be calculated by ascertaining the proportion between the total number of ton-days credited to him for the year and the aggregate number of ton-days credited to all owners for the whole year.    The necessary adjustments will then be made to ensure that when the total of the Interim payments already made is taken into account, the amount received by each owner represents his due proportion.* (13)       If during any quarter of the subsidy year it should appear to the Committee that an undue number of eligible ships which had been laid up are being used for trading and that prejudice is thereby being caused to British shipping, the Committee may recommend that the amounts payable at the end of the quarter should be so adjusted that owners should not receive more in respect of that quarter than they would have received had there been trading in that quarter only such proportion of eligible tonnage as the Committee may recommend.(14)       If in the opinion of the Board of Trade at the end of the subsidy year the average level of freight rates for the year (expressed as an index number representing a percentage) was less than the average for 1929 (represented by 100 per cento) then the total sum payable by the Treasury for the year will be a sum not exceeding a quarter of a*/jNote. In order to meet the eventuality of a refund having to be made by owners as the result of the final adjustments, the forms of claim and payment used for the quarterly interim payments will establish the liability of owners to refund later if so required^

PART II.  ORGANISATION OF THE INDUSTRY.      &quot;        262Memorandum explaining the 0on3tItutIon and Funotions of the Tramp Shlpplng Administrative Con^flittee and Sub-Committees to be set Jf^hy jtlie^ Shipowners .1.   The Government, laying.down certain conditions for the subsidy offered to Tramp Shipping, stated that these Involved &quot;a real measure of organisation&quot; of the Tramp Shipping Industry.2.    Such words are necessarily relative and must be interpreted in relation to such an industry as Tramp Shipping. That Industry, as is fully appreciated by the Government Is international, competitive, and exceptionally fluid In character. Consequently it has hitherto been comparatively unorganised in the sense that, since its development a century ago, it has been marked by a very high degree of individualism among its members. This individualism belongs both to its nature and to its methods. To introduce the principle of organisation and co-operation into such an industry involves a revolutionary change and must necessarily be somewhat experimental in its early stages. Nevertheless the Tramp Shipowners&apos; Committee are convinced that the measure of organisation desired by the Government is not only a prooer condition to their offer of assistance but, if successful, will be of real value to the Industry.     They have therefore submitted that, for the reasons given, His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept a system of co-operation which will be elastic and allow it to grow naturally by trial and error until its more permanent form can be determined by experience, rather than to Insist upon an immediate cast iron system which, by being premature, would be imperfect.General nature of proposals.3. The main features of the organisation proposed by the Tramp Shipowners&apos; Committee are shown below. It will be seen that they contemplate the establishment by the Industry itself of
a &quot;Tramp Shipping Administrative Committee&quot; which might set up sub-committees for particular trade8 or for special purposes. The Committda would, as its main functions, actively promote co-operation among shipowners in(a) minimising domestic competition(b) improving freight rates and conditions;   and(c) promoting as against foreign subsidised competitionthe fullest possible employment of British tramp shipping.It is contemplated that the Committee would make Recommendations as to the steps to be adopted by shipowners for achieving these objects.Constitution of Committee, 4. The Committee would be an elected body composed of twelve members, ten elected by the Tramp ship owners Committee of the Chamber of Shipping and two by the Joint Liner Committee of the Chamber of Shipping and Liverpool Steam Ship Owners&apos; Association, who will also have power to withdraw members appointed by them and to fill vacancies if such arise.     The Chamber of Shipping will provide the necessary staff and accommodation for the work of the Committee.Functions and methods. 5, It is proposed that the functions of the Tramp Shipping Administrative Committee should include the following -(a) to promote organised co-operation among owners tomaintain and improve freights and by such organised co-operation to promote their interests generally.(b) to recommend such conditions of charter as In their discretion they think fit;(c) to confer with Charterers in an effort to increase theemployment of British ships.
operation ,qng Tramp &apos; ers^-operation beenc.sp owners1 cargoner owners.-operation th foreign ipowners sanisations.tion through o-commi committees^6. For the purpose of promoting organised co-operation among owners, as provided above, the Administrative Committee would seek to collect and circulate such information concerning world freight markets as would be likely to be of assistance to shipowners.7. The functions of the Administrative Committee in promoting co-operation among owners would include action -(i) to co-ordinate the operations of Tramp shipowners by influencing them to maintain an united front against any possible combined operation of shippers to depress freights below an economic levelj (ii) to promote co-operation between tramp and cargo liner owners by mutual consultation, direct representation, or liaison with Liner Conferences with a view to mutual action to maintain and improve ratesj(iii) to co-operate where possible with foreign Shipowners&apos; Organisations, such as the International Shipping Conference and the Baltic and International Maritime Conference. 8, The Administrative Committee would appoint sub-committees or co-ordinating committees for the principal trades such a&apos;s the Plate and Australian tramp trades and, if necessary, committees at outportsj    and it might delegate any of its functions to such bodies.     The activities mentioned above would be undertaken either by the Administrative Committee itself or through appropriate Sub-Committees as might be most effective.     In particular the Administrative Committee would probably delegate to Committees with special knowledge of particular trades the carrying out of the objects described above relating
to co-operation between tramp and liner owners and among tramv owners themselves.9.    Normally, the Committees would he left free to arrange co-operation etc. on the lines suited to each trade (since the conditions vary considerably from trade to trade) but would keep in close touch with and be under the control of the Administrative Committee on matters of general policy.Co-operation with Tramp Subsidy Advisory Comm.1ttee.,10.    The Tramp ship owners  Committee understand that a Tramp Subsidy Advisory Committee is to be appointed by the Board of Trade under the provisions of the Tramp Subsidy Act to make recommendations to the Board of Trade regarding the payment of the subsidy.      The Tramp Shipping Administrative Committee will co-operate with the Statutory Committee to secure the objects of the subsidy.Consultation with the shlupinp; inaustry.11.    The Administrative Committee will throughout have the advantage of the experience of the Industry through consultation, when necessary, with -(a) the Tramp Shipowners&apos; Committee of the Chamber ofShipping;(b) the Liner Committee of the Chamber of Shipping;(c) the Council of the Chamber of Shipping.12.    As, moreover, both the Administrative Committee and the Sub-Committees will be composed of practical shipowners in daily contact with the freight markets and with the general conditions and particular needs of all sections of the industry concerned, these bodies will be thorough3.y practical in character and should be able to carry out their functions with the maximum efficiency at the minimum cost of administration.
REPORTS OF WORKING;.13.   a report to the President of the Board of Trade on the working of these Committees and on the progress of organization and co-operation in the industry will be made the end of the first six months of the subsidy year and a further report at the end of the year.November,  19 34.

MERCHANT SHIPPING.Outline of a Scrapping and Rebuilding or Modernising Scheme for British Cargo Vessels discussed between the Presi-dent of the board of trade and representatives of suil&apos;-owners and presented in accordance with the presidents statement to the house of commons on 3rd july, 1934.1. The scheme contemplates that financial assistance would be granted to British owners to enable them to build new United Kingdom tonnage or to modernise existing United Kingdom tou-nage on condition that they scrapped not less than three times as much United Kingdom tonnage of the same general character. The modernising of an existing United Kingdom ship would entitle the owner to the same benefits on the same conditions as would apply to the building of a new ship. The scheme would be ad-ministered by an expert Advisory Committee.2. The scheme would not apply, either in respect of the ships to be built or to be modernised or to he scrapped, to ships carrying more than twelve passengers, ships with a substantial amount of refrigerated cargo space, tankers, ships solely engaged in the coast-wdse trade and cargo liners engaged in the short sea trades. The scheme would apply to the classes of tonnage known as the United Kingdom tramp ships and the United Kingdom general cargo liners with the exceptions indicated above. Applicants would have to show that more than half the property in the vessels to be scrapped was in British ownership on 31st March, 1934.3. A shipowner would be free, within the limits indicated in para-graph 2, to settle the specifications for the work of building or modernising, to select the firm to cany out the work and to make any other necessary arrangements as if the work was being carried out entirely for his own account, subject only to the work being carried out in yards in Great Britain. The scheme would not apply to ships to be built or modernised in shipyards in Northern Ireland, since Government assistance is available there under the Loans Guarantee (Northern Ireland) Act.4. Financial assistance would be given in the form of loans advanced or guaranteed by the Treasury. The rate of interest would not exceed 3 per cent. The loans would be repayable within a period of 12 years by equal annual instalments covering capital and interest but the borrower would be entitled to defer the instalments due in either or both of the first two years and to spread their repayment, with interest, over the remainder of the period of 12 years. The borrower would be responsible for all expenses involved.
o. A shipowner desiring to avail himself of the scheme would apply to the Committee for a loan, the amount of which would not exceed the amount of the accepted tender for building or modernis-ing the ship, together with the expenses of the loan. In considering its amount, the Committee would have regard to the money avail-uble to the owner from the proceeds of the sale of the tonnage to l^e scrapped, so far as such money was not subject to prior charges. The loan would be secured b3&apos; a first mortgage on the ship to be built or modernised.6. Scrapping would be carried out in the United Kingdom except in cases in which the Committee approved other arrangements. Shipowners would be required to give satisfactory guarantees that ships to be sold to foreign jjurchasers for scrapping abroad would not be used by the purchasers for trading before they were scrapped. Ships earmarked for scrapping in this country could only be used lor trading with the approval of the Committee, the intention being that such ships should cease trading before the new or modernised ship was operating.7. Shipowners would be required to give satisfactory guarantees not to sell to foreign purchasers ships which had received assistance, until the mortgage had been paid off. The sale of such ships to British owners would be subject to the prior consent of the Committee.(21IJ74)  Wt    :-2C00 7/31  p. St.  G.S71
