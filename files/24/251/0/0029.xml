ts documentTHE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJ3sty1 sGOVERNMENT)3 C RET.P^J354 (54) . COPY NO.  [j^ia .CAB I N E T.COMMITTEE ON THE REPORTS OP THE INVESTTGATORS INTO THE EE PRESSED AREAS.THIRD REPORT,1.      In their Second Report (CP. 246 (34)) the Committee submitted to the Cabinet certain recommendations regarding inter alia the powers, duties and functions to be assigned to the proposed Commissioner for the Depressed Areas.     A number of questions however, were reserved for further consideration and discussion between the Ministers principally concerned.      These matters are as follows;(a) The question of the responsibility for the scheme in Scotland.(b) The question of the relations between the Minister of Labour and the Commissioner and between the Unemployment Assistance Board and the Commissionero(c) The sum of money to be voted for the use of the Commissioner.2.      The Committee understand that at their Meeting on the 7th November (Cabinet 39 (34) Conclusion 6) the Cabinet agreed that the areas to be covered by the scheme should be the areas surveyed by the four Investigators, and that power should not be taken in the legislation to extend these areas.3.     Following the discussions which have taken place between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of
Labour, the Committee have again considered the reserved matters referred to in paragraph 1, and have reached the following conclusions.4.       The Committee are of the opinion that there should be a separate Commissioner in Scotland who should be responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the same way as the Commissioner in England and Wales will be responsible to the Minister of Labour.5.       The relations between the Minister of Labour and the Commissioner in England and Wales, between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Commissioner in Scotland and between the Unemployment Assistance Board and both Com-missioners should be broadly as followsj-,!The Commissioners will have wide discretion. While their general policy will be subject in England and Wales to the general control of the Minister of Labour, ana in Scotland to the general control of the Secretary of State for Scotland, they will work in close association with the Unemployment Assistance Board in all their experimental work which affects the welfare of the unemployed themselves.      The Board will, however, have no particular concern in the Commissioners1 activities in facilitating the economic development of the areas.      In these activities the Commissioners will work in close acsociation with the other Departments, if any, concerned.&quot;6.       The Committee were informed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he has it in mind to provide an initial fund of  2,000,000 for the purposes of the-2-
proposed, scheme.      They understand that he is considering further whether this sum should cover the activities of both Commissioners, or whether an additional amount should be added in respect of Scotland,      They understand further that he has not yet decided whether a separate. Fund should be set up for the Depressed Areas in Scotland.      The Committee accordingly have not inserted in the Appendix any specific figure of the sum to be voted for the use of the Commissioners,,7.        In the light of their recommendation regarding the relations of the Commissioners to the Minister of Labour, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Unemployment Assistance Board, the Committee have considered further the period for which the Commissioners should be appointed and the question who should ultimately be responsible for the powers proposed to be assigned to the Commissioners.      The Committee recommend that the Commissioners should be appointed for a period of two years, but that power should be taken to extend this period year by year in respect of any or all of the pov/ers.      Such of their powers, duties and respon-sibilities as shall prove to be of continuing value, might, unless Parliament should otherwise determine, be transferred in due course to the Unemployment Assistance Board.8.        The Committee have revised their proposals regarding the suggested powers, duties and responsibilities of the Commissioners in order to incorporate the recommendations made above, and the decision of the Cabinet regarding the areas to be included in the Commissioners&apos; operations (see paragraph 2 ab ove).      The revised proposals are attached to this Report as an Appendix.9.       A number of other recommendations put forward by the Committee in their Second Report have not yet been considered&apos;-5-
by the Cabinet. For the sake of convenience these recommendations are again set out in full below.10.       The Committee accordingly submit to the Cabinet thefollowing recommendations(l)    That   approval in principle should be given to the revised proposals set out in the Appendix to this Report relative to the powers,  duties and functions to be assigned to the proposed Commissioners for the Depressed Areas.(2)    That the proposals in the form approved by the Cabinet should form the basis of the requisite legislation, and that a draft Bill should now be prepared for consideration by the Committee and subsequent Cabinet approval.(3)    That Contractors obtaining Government contracts should be urged to engage their labour through the Employment Exchanges, and that Local Authorities should be invited to make a similar appeal to their own Contractors;    that as regards employers generally local appeals should be made on the same lines to employers in particular areas.(4)    That no change should be made in the 1930/31 settlement under which grants towards land drainage schemes are only made through properly constituted Catchment Boards.(5)    That the suggested provision for ArterialDrainage in Scotland falls outside the scope of proposals for dealing with the Depressed Areas.(6)    That a grant should not be made from public funds towards the Jarrow Slake scheme.(7)    That a grant should not be made from public funds in aid of the proposed Senghenydd to Nelson Road.(8)    That an examination should be made withoutdelay into the Local Government arrangements on Tyneside and at Merthyr Tydfil respectively.(9)    That favourable consideration should be given to the question of according special priority for any Public Works schemes of economic value which would be undertaken in the normal course in the Depressed Areas.The Committee further call the attention of the Cabinet to the following matters(10)    The Committee have invited the Minister of Transport to proceed as rapidly as possible with an enquiry into the proposal for im-proving Whitehaven Harbour.
(11)    The Committee have asked the Minister of Transport for his opinion on the proposed road tunnel under the Tyne, and in particular whether local support is likely to be forth-coming for the scheme if the grant from the Road Fund does not exceed 60$,(12)    In the opinion of the Committee, pending the appointment of the Commissioners and consider-ation by the Government of housing policy generally,  the question of a special con-tribution in aid of housing in the Depressed Areas should be deferred.Signed on behalf of the Committee N.

APPENDIX.TJfK SUGGESTED POWERS,, DUTIES, AND FUNCTIONS OE THE PR OP 0 SEP COIMISSIC NKR 3 FOR THE DSPRE5CEPAREAS.1.     There shall be two Commissioners, one for the depressed areas in England and Wales and one for the depressed areas in Scotland.2.     The areas to be covered by the operations of the Commissioners shall be the areas surveyed by the Investigators, and power should not be taken in the proposed legislation to extend those areas.3.      The general functions of the Commissioners are defined as follows :-&quot;to be responsible for the initiation, organisation and prosecution of schemes designed to facilitate the economic development and social improvement of the four Areas surveyed by the Investigators&quot;.The above general definition is subject to two limitations, (i)    Ordinarily they are to devote themselves to work which cannot be done under existing powers, (ii)   They will not have power to subsidise industrial undertakings trading for profit.4.      The first of these limitations means that they will not be able to undertake schemes of a kind which are already being done ox&apos; can be done by Government Departments or Local Authorities, and that any assistance they might give towards such schemes would have to bo of a different nature from that available from the appropriate Department.    Outside this field a number of proposals have been made of which the most important are the following :-
(a) Improving the amenities of the depressed areas - e.g. by the removal of slagheaps,  the clearance of derelict factory sites etc.(b) Provision of occupational centres for the unemployed, including agricultural subsistence holdings and other centres where the products of the members are retained by or are exchanged among themselves,(c) Experiments in agricultural holdings in the depressed areas, including co-operative holdings.    (Under experiments of this kind farming operations involving the employment of workpeople might be undertaken by a Corporation, with the assistance of the Commissioners.)The Commissioners should have power to assist schemes of the above types;    but in the case of occupational centres their power to assist should be limited to centres not carried on for profit.5.      The Commissioners should also have power to consider for assistance other schemes which satisfy the conditions of paragraph (5) above.6.      The Commissioners should not be precluded from assisting schemes outside the depressed areas which would employ work-people from those areas.7.      While as already stated the Commissioners should not be empowered to undertake works falling within the existing powers or duties of Government Departments or Local Authorities they should be at liberty to bring to the notice of the appropriate Government Department or Local Authority schemes which in their view satisfy the main condition in paragraph 5 and ought to be carried out.      The Commissioners could also bring to the notice of the appropriate Department any suitable schemes which were not being carried out owing to the inability of Local Authorities to finance them or to some other difficulty.      The case of land drainage in England and
Wales provides an example of the way in which the Commissioners might work under this procedure.    There are land drainage works which could profitably be undertaken and which would provide a good deal of employment in Durham,  South Wales and west Cumberland.      The Ministry of Agriculture consider it undesirable to make grants in aid of land drainage except  through Catchment Boards.      Difficulty arises in setting up Catchment Boards owing to the objections of County Boroughs which would oe involved in increased rates disproportionate to the advantages they would obtain. If, however,  it could be announced that, provided the Commissioners recommended it, a grant would be made from the Exchequer sufficient to allay the fears of the local authorities concerned it is probable that the objections to setting up Catchment Boards would disappear.3.      It seems undesirable that the Commissioners themselves should carry out schemes, as this would involve them in., a mass of detail.    They should be empowered to enter into arrangements with other persons or bodies for the carrying out of such schemes as fall within their province, e,g0  the cleaning up of the depressed areas might be carried out through an Amenities Trust, the co-operative agricultural holdings through an Agricultural Corporation,  the provision of occupational centres or other welfare work through some voluntary organisation.9.     Existing Exchequer grants made in respect of welfare work in or on behalf of the depressed areas e,g. grants to the National Council for Social Service, and any additional grants to be made for similar purposes should in future be made through the Commissioners.10.    In order that they may be able to carry out their functions it will be necessary to give the Commissioners power to ac-quire land exp.edit-iou.sly and compulsorily, to hold land, to sell it and to transfer it to Local Authorities or public bodies,-3.-:   ^
11. Questions may arise whether the Commissioners can accept contributions from non-Government sources.     Provided, there are not attached to these contributions conditions which would embarrass the Commissioners in their freedom of action or render them accountable to outside bodies, it is thought that they should have such powers.12. The Commissioners will have wide discretion.     while their general polio:/ will be subject to the general controlof the Minister of Labour in England and Wales, and to theSecretary of State for Sec bland in Scotland, the Commissionerswill work in close association with the Unemployment AssistanceBeard in all their experimental work which a ffeeto the welfare of the unemployed themselves.      The Board will, however, haveno particular concern in the Commissioners&apos;  activities in facilitating the economic development of the areas.      In these activities the Commissioners will work in close association with the other Departments,  if any,  concerned.13. For the purpose of meeting the expenditure of theCommissioners, it is proposed that a sum of  X should be votedto a separate Fund or Punas under the control of the Treasury,to be expended by them in such annual issues to the Commission-ers as Parliament may from time to time determine.      some additional sum would presumably have to be voted to theCommissioners direct for their needs in the current year.This procedure appears to permit provision of funds out ofthis year&apos;s Budget and at the same time to allow parliamentary control over the issues from year to year.14. It is suggested that the Commissioners should beappointed for two years, but that power should be taken tocontinue the appointments from year to year in respect of anyor all of their powers, duties,and responsibilities.    It is contemplated, that in due course such of their powers, duties,and responsibilities as shall have been proved to be of continuing value might, unless Parliament should otherwisedetermine, be transferred to the Unemployment Assistance Board.-4-
