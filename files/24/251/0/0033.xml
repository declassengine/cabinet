(THIS DOCUMENT IS TILE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITTANNIC MAJESTY1 S C-0VEBNx 31^T) .SECRET COPY No. 3&amp;CP.   58(54)CABINET.india appreciation oftho Political Situation By the Government of India, dated 14th November,  1934,Circulated for the  information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 14th November, 1934,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.The most important event of the last month has been the session of Congress in Bombay.      In recent appreciations,  stress has been laid on the divisions in the Congress camp and it might have been anticipated that these divisions would be accentuated rather than diminished at the full session.     Actually, the session has resulted in yet another personal triumph for Mr. Gandhi, whose physical and mental vigour is reported to be unabated and &quot;who has succeeded in keeping these divergent elements, if not in one organisation, at least under one leadership, his own.The two moot significant features of the Bombay-session are  (a) reorganisation of Congress Executive; (b/ Mr. Gandhi&apos;s resignation from Congress and the proposed formation of the All-India Village Industries Association.In regard to  (a),  it might appear at first sight that the reorganisation proposals,  carried largely as a result of Gandhi&apos;s personal influence, were designed merely to make Congress less unwieldy and more business like.      Thus, the number of delegates to a plenary session has been reduced from 6,000 to  ,000, while the All-India Congress Committee is to consist of only 166 members, about half the present number. More important than the reduction of the members is the decision that in future 75 per cent, of the delegates will be from rural areas, a change made in recognition of the fact that Congress, as at present constituted, consists largely of urban classes and that it is necessary
that it should become representative of the rural masses.     Elections &quot;both to the central and provincial committees have been arranged so as to secure that the candidates are genuine representatives of their constituencies, and this again will bring the central body in close touch with the rural areas, in which the village industries board will be working. The President, who will be elected by the delegates, has full power to nominate members of the working committee.Rajendra Prasad, who added considerably to his prestige by the able way in which he presided over the Bombay session, will continue as President, and it Is significant that he is a very loyal henchman of Mr. Gandhi.      The latter has made It clear that he will give counsel to those who seek it and he will undoubtedly continue to exercise from the background a controlling influence over the decisions of Congress. It is to be noted that Mr. Gandhi&apos;s speech in support of the reformed organisation conveyed the impression that he was paving the way for the gradual development of Congress into a &quot;constituent assembly&quot;.The Parliamentary Board will continue as at present constituted for some time longer.Mr. Gandhi in a published statement has observed that he is convinced that,  in the present circumstances of the country and in the absence of any general scheme of civil resistance, a parliamentary party within Congress is the necessary part of any programme.     The reference to civil resistance shows that the leader has not given up the idea of using this weapon if and when opportunity offers.
As regards the policy to he followed by Congress candidates in the Legislature, Rajendra Prasacl&apos;s presidential address contained an attack on stereotyped lines on the White Paper proposals which, ho contended, would result in a federation in which the &quot;unabashed autocracy would sit entrenched in one-third of India and peep in every now and then to strangle the popular ,vili in the remaining two-thirds&quot;. He also referred at length to the &quot;ruthless&quot; rule by ordinances.Mr. Gandhi&apos;s retirement from Congress is justified in his published statement by reference to the vital difference in outlook which has grown up between many Congress workers and himself.     He over-emphasises this point,  for experiences of the Bombay session and of meetings at Patna and Wardha earlier in the year show that these differences recede into the background as soon as he steps on to the platform. The more genuine reason appears to be that &quot;he needs for experiment to which his life is dedicated complete detachment and absolute freedom&quot;.     His retirement is also to enable him to organise a village industries association,  one of the stated objects of which is to secure the aim, which Congress has had from its inception,  of progressive identification with the masses.      The idea of senii-autonomous boards on these lines has undoubtedly been at the back of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s mind for some time past and has the two-fold object of establishing contact with the masses and providing work for those Congress followers who are against Parliamentary works) .The new movement is said to bo non-political,
4.but there is very little doubt that Mr. Gandhi has in no way given up his ultimate objective;    he has dropped the more direct method advocated by the Lahore Congress of 1929,  of a no rent campaign, and has adopted a more subtle but no less dangerous method of influencing the cultivating classes.During the Bombay Congress, Socialists who were in a minority and without their leader, Jawahar Lai Nehru, met with little success, especially when Mr. Gandhi himself took part in the proceedings.     Do Congress Socialist has been nominated to the working-committee, except Nehru, and it appears probable that the Socialist resolutions which were referred to the working committee for disposal will not for the present be accepted.Mr. Gandhi has himself stated that he has fundamental differences with those who support the Socialist programme, but he &quot;welcomes the formation of this group which contains very respected and self-sacrificing workers11 .The results of contested elections so far reported.,   show that Congress, with its superior organisation,  is in a strong position.      Two Congress candidates have been returned from Assam by large majorities, while in Madras a leading Congressman, Mr. Satyamurti has defeated the sitting member of the Justice tarty, Mr. Mudaliar, by a large majority.      The President of the Legislative Assembly, also a member of the Justice forty, has also been defeated.      These first results will no doubt encourage the Congress supporters in other constituencies.
