IS J2QPUM5NT IS THE PROPERTY CF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).CRF.T. GCPY NO.     c27  CABINET. /P.S4C(34).ELECTRICITY (SUPPLY) BILL. 1934o Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport,,In Memorandum CP.45(34) my predecessor sought the authority of the Cabinet to the introduction of a Bill amending, in certain particulars, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926.The Bill as introduced v/as confined to four clauses, and after amendment passed through all its stages in the House of Lords last May.jf the four clauses, Clause 3 is mainly of a technical character and is substantially agreed with the electrical industry.Clause 4 gives effect to the recommendation of Lord v/eir&apos;s Committee on Railway Electrification and enables the Central Electricity Board to supply railway companies direct,, It provides that supplies shall not be so given within the area of supply of any authorised undertakings who own a Selected station without their consent, but provides further that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.      This clause is strongly supported by the railway companies..      It is, in my opinion, fully justified, and though it is exciting a certain amount of opposition, I have little doubt that it would commend itself to the House of Commons.      I therefore propose to retain the clause, although it could be dropped without affecting the remainder of the Bill,,Of the remaining two olauses, Olause 1 empowers the Central Electricity Board to enter Into agreements with non-selected stations in the circumstances explained in paragraph (2) of my predecessor&apos;s Memorandum.      It also validates agreements already entered into.    By amendments made in the House of Lords new
agreements are to be subject to the consent of the Electricity Commissioners who are directed as to the points on which they are to satisfy themselves before consenting.Clause 2 authorises the Board to quote special prices to enable authorised electricity undertakings to negotiate prices with consumers for exceptional supplies where special circumstances exist.These provisions are not opposed by the bulk of the electricity supply industry.     The municipal interests which guarantee about two-thirds of the total supply have raised no objections in principle.     The Power Companies&apos; Association has declined to petition against the Bill, but the Bill has excited the violent opposition of two groups which work for this purpose in alliance, and one of which happens to be represented in the House 9f Commons.I need not enter into a detailed description of the effect of Clause l.     I am assured, as wa my predecessor, by the Electricity Commissioners and by the Central Electricity Board, that it is essential to the success of the Grid and the realisation of the objects of the 1926 Act within a reasonable time that, in the circumstances which have developed, the Board should have power to enter into such agreements and that they are necessary to deal with generating stations which, for technical and other grounds, the Board would not be justified in making Selected stations, and which, on the other hand, ought not to be left to maintain and perhaps enlarge their separate existence indefinitely outside the nexus of the Grid system.In respect of future agreements the Electricity Commissioners are already required by the terms of the Bill to satisfy themselves that these arrangements, (which are not compulsory and require the agreement of the undertaking with which they are made), will not result in a financial loss to the Board, or In any substantial prejudice to any authorised
electricity undertaking which is under contract to supply electricity to, or take electricity from, the owners of the generating station in question.      This, I think, is a reasonable and sufficient protection and I should be willing by further amendments to bring under the same review the agreements (about twenty in number) which have already been made.      There will thus be an opportunity given to private interests, having existing contractual arrangements, of making representations with respect to the matter before any agreement becomes finally valid. Indeed, if it could be shown to me, as has not yet been done, that any other interests might be specially and adversely touched, I would consider enlarging the rights of representation conferred by the clause as it stands at present.The Central Electricity Board, who met specially yesterday, have conveyed to me their feeling of consternation at the prospect of delay in the passage of this Bill.     They have already issued stock on their own credit to the amount of  50 nn without asking for recourse to the Treasury Guarantee (up to  33^- m. ) which the Act of 1926 made possible.      There is another  10 m. of capital to be raised over the next few years and it must be remembered that the finances and tariffs of the Board have been arranged on the basis that they would be able to secure for the Grid the greatest possible load at the earliest possible date, as was the underlying object of the Act.I recognise, of course, the difficulties of the Government time-table.     The Cabinet, in approving the introduction of the Bill, stipulated that arrangements should be made with the Whips on this point.     The Bill was consequently introduced in the House of Lords and passed rapidly through all Its stages in that House.     Shortly afterwards it became necessary to take In the House of Commons a Private Bill containing among other matters a clause to authorise the Corporation concerned to enter one of these agreements.     My
npredecessor again saw the Chief Whip and, after receiving an assurance, which was conveyed to the Board, that the Government&apos;s Bill would he given very high priority as soon as the House met in October, made the following statement on the 20th Junes-&quot;It may well be that the House will think that a question of such importance and such general application as this should be settled once and for all by a general decision of the House as a whole upon the principle that is raised in a public Bill and not on this Bill. I quite understand the difficulty of the promoters of this Bill and their desire that in one way or another the principle shall be settled, either on this Bill or on the Government Bill, in plenty of time for them to make whatever arrangements they have to make as a consequence of the decision that the House takes-      The public Bill has already passed through all its stages in another place.      It is the intention of the Government to pass it into law.     While the date on which the Bill can be taken must depend upon other business, the Government fully recognises the importance of the time factor, and there will be no avoidable delay.      I can give the promoters of the Bill that assurance, but, in so far as it falls to me as a Member of the House to advise them at all, I could not advise them to raise In this Measure, and through this medium, and in a limited form, the very principle which the Government are going to call upon them to discuss and decide In the widest possible ferm and by a procedure which is the appropriate one for the occasion&quot;,,The House accepted the advice and it will be observed that stress was laid both upon the appropriateness of proceeding by public bill and upon the Government&apos;s appreciation of the importance of the time factor and of passing its Bill into
law without -avoidable delay.It is suggested in some-quarters that the Bill should now he treated as a Private Bill and referred to a Select Committee,,      I have also asked the Board whether they would he prepared to promote a Private Bill and they say that they would not.      They point out, with unanswerable force, that the object of this request is to wreck the Bill by delay or otherwise, that the object of the present Bill, which I understand the Speaker is prepared to rule should properly be treated (as it was treated by the Upper House) as a Public Bill, is to amend, as a matter of public policy, certain of the provisions of the 1926 Act, and that any reference to a Select Committee, apart from the expense in fees and the delay which it would involve, might he made-the opportunity for a general roving inquiry inte* the principles and operation of the Grid.I am aware of no reason whatever why this great constructive Measure passed in 1926 should he brought under any such kind of criticism or review, at the instance of those who obstructed its passage and have been hostile to it ever since.It is no doubt unfortunate that a number of agreements which were made by the Board in good faith and on the advice of their own legal advisers, are found, in the Opinion of the Law Officers, in fact to be ultra vires, but, as a body of experienced business men, they have done their best to bring to successful fruition the scheme of 1926, which they were appointed to administer, and they are entitled to the active support of the Government in the present matter.      At the same time, I have been made aware by the Chief \7hip of his difficulties with regard, to the time-table.     Formidable as they are, I am convinced that if the Bill has to be passed into law, of which they can be no doubt-, we shall add enormously to our Parliamentary difficulties by delay.     Had it been possible to proceed with the Second Reading shortly after the Bill came down from the House of Lords,
a great deal of the opposition which has gathered strength would not have been encountered.      If we now postpone the Bill, even to next Session, the objectors will claim this as a triumph and lose no time in putting every pressure upon those who have hitherto declined to declare themselves against the billo      If it becomes impossible to secure the passage of the Bill before the House Is prorogued, I submit that it is essential that    it should be re-introduced immediately upon Parliament re-assembling, and given a Second Reading before Christmas, that the demand for reference to a Select Committee should be rejected and that the Committee Stage should be taken on the Floor of the House.      To send the Bill upstairs may involve protracted delays during which time useful and necessary development will be hindered and grave inconvenience caused to those undertakings which are anxious to enter into agreements with the Board.     As I have already indicated, important amendments could be proposed at the appropriate stage which would meet any legitimate apprehensions of private interests, apart from those v/ho are actuated by dislike and hostility to the Measure of 1926 itself.I hope therefore that the Cabinet will see its way to assist the work of the Board by a firm declaration of its decision to place the Bill on the Statute Book at a very early date and authorise the arrangements necessary to give effect to that declaration,(Initialled)   L. H-B.1st November. 1934.
