THIS DOCUMENT IS Pj^PgnTx OF HIS BRFMJCTIC MAJESTY&apos;S ^dOVllRNMENT.C RET Copy No.   w cabinet.Memor&amp;j^im, by the^ Minister ofa decision is required whether a population Census should be taken in 1936.     The Census Act, 1920,  enabled a Census to be /taken every five years.      The prevailing opinion was that for scientific and administrative purposes a ten years&apos;   interval was too long.      In 1926 the need for economy prevailed,  and no Census was taken.      If one is to be taken in 1936,  preparations must be set on foot more than twelve months in advance of the actual date.      The matter is  me of sufficient importance to call for settlement by the Cabinet.The statistical material obtained from a Census in 1936 would be of much general advantage to scientific enquiries and general administration.Representations in favour of it have been received from the Royal Statistical Society,  and economists of eminence have published letters in the same sense.      I understand that the Minister of Labour strongly supports the same view.      The Ministry of Labour has to mane frequent use especially of the, industry and occupation tables and fears that its work will be seriously handicapped if it has to rely on the 1931 Census till the results of the 194-1 Census become available.So far as the Ministry of Health is concerned,  the following consideration is very relevant: -The adoption in the Local Government Act,  1929,  of&apos; an Exchequer Grant formula based mainly upon population figures strengthened the case for a more frequent Census.      To satisfy local authorities as t) the reliability of the calculations
determining their grants, a statement was made on behalf of the then Minister of Health in Committee on the Bill in the House of Commons that he had in contemplation a five year Census instead of a ten year Census;    and in a White Paper issued in the following month of &quot;amendments to Part VI of the Bill proposed by the Minister of Health after discussion with local authorities&quot; it was stated that &quot;it is proposed that after 1931 the Census should be taken at quinquennial intervals,   so that the distribution of the grant would be based on Census figures of population instead of estimates.&quot;It should, however,  be noted that under another provision in the Local Government Act, 1929,  it will be necessary,  in consultation with local authorities to investigate the working of the &quot;needs&quot; formula for the general Exchequer grant before the 1st April, 1957,  and to embody any resulting changes in legislation having effect from that date.      This investigation will have to be made on the basis of the Registrar General&apos;s estimates of population and in advance of the results of a 1936 Census.        So far local authorities generally have been content to accept those estimates and have shown no disposition to press for the 1936 Census.The reasons against taking a Census in 1936  are first, that it will cost about  350,000 for England and W&amp;lec and Scotland combined (almost entirely payable in 1936-7 and later), second,  that a Census means some public inconvenience  in a year in which there may be a general election (the date of the Census, if taken, would probably be in April,  or early May).On balanoe,  I should recommend that a Census should be made in 1936, because of its utility as a basis for national planning in such matters as housing,  but I do not feel that I can press the case for it strongly,  if it is thought the consideration of economy and public convenience should prevail.The Secretary of State for Scotland concurs  in this memorandum.(Intld.)       E. H. Y.o        3.1st December, 1934.
