;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.393Copy No.6   (34) c A B I N E TDEFIES SEP AREAS:___TYNESIDE AND MERTHYR TYDFTL .MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HALTH .In their recent reports, Mr. E;ian Wallace suggested an investigation into the amalgamation of Tyneside Authorities, and Sir Wyndham Portal suggested an investigation into the present status of Merthyr Tydfil as a county borough.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Plouse of Commons on the 14th November that the Government had decided that inquiries shall be made in both cases by competent bodies.The Tyneside suggestion raises large and highly controversial issues.      It is desirable that the investigation should be held by a body with power to call for evidence, if need be,  not merely able to invite evidence.      For that reason, I propose that the investigation be held by a Royal Commission of three persons,  consisting of an independent chairman, preferably a former holder of high judicial office,  a member with experience of county government and a third member with experience of urban government.      An alternative to a Royal Commission would be to appoint a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, but this procedure would require a resolution of both Houses,  and the Act was not drawn v/ith this kind of inquiry in mind.The Merthyr Tydfil case is simpler,  and I propose to arrange that the inquiry shall be held by two persons of suitable  status and experience.I shall be glad of the authority of the Cabinet for these proposals.      I propose to see representatives of the Authorities concerned before any public announcement is made and. to explain the proposals and the reasons for them.(Intld.)    E.H..Y.12th December, 1934.
