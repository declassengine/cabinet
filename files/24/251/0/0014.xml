DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY ON HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. ); copy NO.cabinet.disar: lament coherence, i952,MINISTERIAL coi.committee. PEEVATE MAT-iUPActure of ARMS. report.With reference to  the Report of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament to  the Cabinet (CP. 250(54)), a further meeting of the Committee was held on Tuesday, 50th October, 1934, in order to discuss the Draft Convention which had been prepared by the Interdepartmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal.2.     After a very full discussion during which the position both at Geneva and in the House of Commons was examined, the following conclusions were recorded :-(a) that the Committee were not prepared to recommend at the present moment that we should take the initiative at Geneva by putting-forward the Interdepartmental Committee&apos;s Draft Convention;(b) that this recommendation might require re-consideration as a result of the&apos;forthcoming Debate in the House of Commons;(c) that as regards the line to be taken by the Government spokesman at the forthcoming Debate in the House of Commons,  the following points might   be developed(i)     that the abolition of private manufacture of arms and the substitution of State manufacture is, for reasons which must be fully developed, impracticable and would produce consequences on our security, finance and industrial organisation which cannot be contemplated?
(v)  that unfortunately the prospects of achieving any such general agreement on disarmament were not very hopeful, but nevertheless we still held the conviction that it might be possible to achieve some more limited objective;(vi)  that the mere examination of manufacture in a country itself would appear to have no particular point without a general disarmament convention, but the export trade of the country w as an entirely different matter and that it might be valuable to put forward an appropriate proposal in this connection for the control of the export trade of all countries on the lines at present practised by us, and also to make provision for any embargo which   it might be desired to impose internationally;(vii) that it would be desirable, in general, torefer to future action at Geneva in order to meet the requirements of expectations which have been raised, such reference to be kept, however s in very general terms and the Government not to be committed to any details;(viii) that there might be advantage in challenging the Opposition, if tney pressed for the abolition of private manufacture, as to where such a step might ultimately lead;(ix) fiat our condemnation of illicit transaction-tioas should be plain and definite, and it could be stated that the Government would be prepared to examine any definite allegations within our jurisdiction;(x)  that in illustration of the futility of action alone, our experiences with japan and China might be referred to.(Intld.)      J.R.M.2, Whitehall Gardens, s* V*. 1. , -31st October, 1934.(ii)  that consequently the practical line is to regulate and control export with a view to preventing ill effects and to framing a machinery which v/ould enable an embargo to be applied.(iii)  that for this purpose international action is needed.(iv)  that the Geneva Draft Convention was drawn up to form an integral part of the Disarmament Convention and that so much importance was attached by the United Kingdom Government to arriving at a general agreement on disarmament that if such an agreement was reached we should be prepared to accept the Geneva Draft;
