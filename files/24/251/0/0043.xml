I. Introductory.1. The latest summary of progress in German military rearmament was described in C.I.D. Paper No. 1148-B, pp. 29-32.The following memorandum deals with the main points of German rearrna-ment progress in the past three months.(Note. The question of air armaments in Germany is not dealt with in this paper.)The Reichswehrministerium (the German Ministry of Defence) are now actively engaged in the expansion of the 100,000 long-service army to the 300,000 short-service army claimed by the German Government. Details of German rearmament, and the conclusions of the General Staff on the progress achieved, are discussed in the following sections.II. Preparations for the expansion of the peace-time regular army.The creation of new formations and military areas.2. There are numerous reports that new military areas and formations are being created, but as yet there is no definite evidence. &apos; Reports state that cavalry divisions are being reorganised, and it is known that the Headquarters, 1st Cavalry Division, have moved from Frankfurt-on-the-Oder to Potsdam. Headquarters for cavalry brigades are reported to have been formed.  There arepArt i.(Secret.)GERMAN NAVAL FORCES.
indications that one or more mechanized formations, possibly composed of armoured fighting vehicles and infantry in mechanical transport vehicles, are in process of being constituted.The creation of new units.3. (i) General. Numerous changes of garrisons of Reichsheer (Regular Army) units are taking place, which point to a large scale reorganisation. It is believed that new &quot;shadow&quot; units have been formed with surplus personnel, and that these units exist side by side with the Reichsheer units of the authorised establishment.(ii) Units equipped ivith Armoured Fighting Vehicles. Tank training centres are reported at Zossen, Doberitz and Wunsdorf. Mechanical transport training centres are known to be located at the fust two camps. Cavalry personnel in large numbers are apparently being transferred to mechanical transport units; our Military Attache, Berlin, has seen a number of cavalry personnel still in breeches and boots, but wearing the piping of mechanical transport troops. Two cavalry regiments are reported to be completely mechanised, but no details are available.(iii) Artillery. A number of reports show that medium batteries (armed with 15 cm. howitzers and 10 cm. guns) are being constituted. Certain horse transport units are also being converted into artillery units. New anti-aircraft artillery batteries are apparently being formed within existing artillery regiments.The increase in personnel.4. Accurate estimates of strength are very difficult to obtain, but it can be accepted that the Reichsheer is now at least 100,000 over strength and possibly more. General von Reichenau, in fact, recently admitted to the Belgian Military Attache in Berlin that the Reichsheer strength was now probably double the: authorised establishment, but he added that &quot; the increase in numbers represented no additional military strength, as the whole army was now a training school.&quot; Reports state that the total with the colours will be raised to 300,000 in the course of the next few months.It is established from reports that large numbers of short-service regular personnel were enlisted for eighteen months&apos; colour service in April 1934, and there are indications that men have also been enlisted for one year&apos;s colour service. Long-service non-commissioned officers, who have completed their engagements,, are being permitted to remain with the colours.One of the main difficulties in obtaining accurate reports of existing strengths lies in the fact that large numbers of the short-service personnel are concentrated in training camps (probably in the &quot;shadow&quot;&apos; units mentioned above).The provision of additional officers.5. Reports continue to show very large numbers of officer candidates serving with units, and the time spent by officer candidates in the ranks, prior to attending the officers&apos; school, appears to have been considerably reduced. All officer candidates who have joined since April 1934 are apparently to join the officers&apos; school in January 1935. They will only spend six months at the school before becoming officers. Two courses will be held at the school in 1935. Serving non-commissioned officers have been promoted to officer rank. Numerous reports confirm that retired officers and senior non-commissioned officers are being put through training courses with a view to their re-employment in the ex panded army.A secret staff college has been in existence for some years according to a recent French report; the annual output is between 50 and 60 staff officers.The provision of barracks and permanent training camps.6. Reports from numerous sources show great activity in the construction of new barracks; the building programme will, it is believed, not be completed until the spring of 1935. There is also considerable building activity in the various training camps.[10690] b 2
Civilian tenants of former army barracks and police and administrative personnel accommodated in former army buildings are being turned out to free the accommodation for the military authorities.Everything points to the necessity of the army being able to accommodate far larger numbers by the spring of 1935.Purchase of remounts.7. Remouzits for the army are being bought in considerable numbers in Germany, and also in Denmark (4,800), Hungary (2,350 in the first quarter of 1934) and Belgium (1,450).III. Preparations for expansion of the army on mobilization.Training and organisation of the Police.8. A reorganisation of the regular armed police (Landespolizei or Schutz-polizei) is in progress, and control of the police is being centralised. Units of the armed police are being grouped in formations corresponding to regiments. Although the primary role of the Landespolizei is considered to be internal security, it is believed that under present conditions police regiments would be employed on mobilization to stiffen the secret frontier defence force (the Grenzschutz).The armed police in the demilitarised Rhineland receive frequent training in delaying action, demolitions and withdrawals, indicating that police units will be used as a covering force to delay a French advance into the Rhineland.Training of Reserve Officers.9. Reports mention the training of reserve officers; students are being taken as &quot;one-year volunteers,&quot; as in the pre-war army, for training as reserve officers. A reserve officers&apos; school is reported to be located at the Dresden Infantry School. Landespolizei officers have been seen taking part in Reichsheer exercises. A report states that the number of officers with the secret frontier defence force is to be largely increased.Training of Nazi Sturmabteilungen (S.A.) personnel with the Reichsheer.10. A proportion of S.A. personnel is still being attached to the Reichsheer for 3 months&apos; training courses. It is stated that the personnel sign an engagement to come up wdien required.Training in S.A. tmits.11. Military Attache, Berlin, considers, and this is borne out by other reports, that the purely military training of the S.A. units under the auspices of their own leaders has very much decreased since the 30th June. Reports state that arms have been withdrawn from S.A. units, and that some of the special S.A. training camps and courses have been closed down. The S.A., however, still do drill and physical training, and are given lectures on military subjects. The S.A. are apparently being reduced in numbers, but no definite figures are available. The Schutzsteaffel (S.S.), the pick of the Nazi forces, on the other hand, appear to be increasing in strength.Pre-military Training.12. According to reports, pre-military training appears now to be universal in labour service camps, although actual training with weapons is not believed to be general.   Recruits for the army are being selected from the labour camps.Students at universities are stated to be compelled to attend special military courses of instruction.Pre-military training is also given to the Hitlerjugend (the Hitler youth movement).Amalgamation of Nazi mechanical transport organisations.13. All mechanical transport units of the S.A. have now been amalgamated in the National-Sozialistiches Kraftfahr-Korps (N.S.K.K.), which is con-sidered by our Military Attache, Berlin, to be the first reserve of mechanical transport units for the army. N.S.K.K. units took part in the only large road transport exercise held by the Reichsheer this autumn.
Mobilization Machinery.14. We have no definite information as to the future mobilization and recruiting organization which will be formed for the future German Army; it is clear that a start has been made with the registration of reserve officers. According to reports, retired officers are being attached to the civil administration in towns and country districts to act as recruiting and presumably mobilization officers.IY. The provision of War Material.15. Reports from many sources show intense activity in the German armament industry. It may be noted that, whereas under the rulings of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in Germany under 40 specified factories were authorized to manufacture definite quantities of war material, at least 300 factories, controlled by over 150 firms, are credibly reported recently to have been engaged in such manufacture, and to be prepared for intensive output in case of emergency.16. The question of German armament reserves is discussed in C.I.D. Paper No. 1152-B, dated the 5th November, 1934, which has been submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, and detailed information regarding German munition manufacture is therefore not included in this paper.C.I.D. Paper No. 1152-B shows that the supply of 15-cm. howitzers is one of the main deficiencies in the equipment of the German Army. Very recent reports indicate that steps are being taken to meet this deficiency and that the manufacture of medium artillery equipment has begun. One report states that the Germany Army now has about 200 15-cm. howitzers. A further report mentions castings for a hundred 15-cm. guns or howitzers at one factory.A report states that one million pairs of ankle-boots are stored at the Army Clothing Depot in Berlin.Y. Conclusions.(a) Man-Power.(i) Strength of Regular Army.As regards man-power, the German Government is now in a position to come into the open at any time, and confront the Powers with the fact that the German Army has been expanded to three cavalry and twenty-one infantry divisions, with a peace establishment of 300,000.There would be no difficulty in re-introducing conscription at the same time.(ii) Provision of trained reserves.Parallel with the expansion of the regular army, the German Govern-ment are continuing to build up a war-time reserve, by giving military training to personnel of the unauthorised forces, the labour service and the police, to make up for Germany&apos;s lack of trained reserves in case of mobilization.(iii) Deductions.The time when the German Government decide to come into the open will presumably depend on what they consider the most favourable moment as regards the foreign political situation.Our Military Attache, Berlin, and other foreign observers in Berlin, believe that, although the Reichswehrministerium are working systematically to achieve the 300,000 army, the German military authorities wish at present to avoid the necessity of making any declaration as to Germany&apos;s intentions, and are particularly anxious not to arouse French susceptibilities. Our Military Attache, Berlin, therefore believes that the Reichswehrministerium will do all they can to continue to conceal the unauthorised arms and forma-tions as long as they possibly can. The general regime of secrecy in Germany may enable them to do so for some time.This may well be so. In addition, the German Government may well desire to delay the period of acute tension with other countries, which is bound to follow Germany&apos;s repudiation of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, until after the Saar Plebiscite. But the accomplished fact of German rearmament cannot be indefinitely concealed, and sooner or later Germany :must come into the open.
(b) Material.(i) Equipment.The expanded peace-time army may at the outset have a comparatively low scale of equipment in tanks and medium artillery, but this can be made good in a relatively short time.(ii) Reserves.The Germans are, however, working at high pressure to equip their increased peace-time army, and to provide adequate mobilization and war reserves. At the same time, it is not considered that the present scale of munition production would suffice for a war of aggression. This opinion is confirmed by General Gamelin, the Chief of the French General Staff, who recently told our Military Attache, Paris, that, according to the latest French information, the German armament industry was at present working at a rate which was only slightly above their normal rate of production.(c) Defensive nature of German preparations.All indications point to Germany&apos;s present preparations being entirely defensive. Reports shown that extensive preparations have been made to evacuate officials and men of military age from the Rhineland in case of a French attack. The armed police in the Rhineland are being trained in demolitions, delaying actions, and the evacuation of material.According to our reports, the anti-aircraft defences in Western Germany are still in a rudimentary stage. This is a strong argument that Germany has at present no aggressive intentions in the West. Without adequate air defences, the vital Ruhr industrial area and the large centres of population in the Rhine Valley, such as Cologne and the Mayence-Frankfurt-Mannheim area, would be at the mercy of French bombing-attacks.Similarly, in the East, there are at present no signs of an aggressive military policy.(d) Forces Germany can place and maintain in the field.The General Staff consider that Germany could at present only mobilize the forces described in Paper No. D.C. (M) (32) 128* of the 27th July, 1934, namely :-&quot; (i) Three or four cavalry divisions and twenty-one infantry divisions, with a normal scale of field artillery, but weak in medium howitzers. Sufficient light tanks and improvised infantry support tanks -would be available to arm a considerable number of tank battalions to be raised on mobilization, (ii) A large frontier defence force, with a sufficient scale of machine guns, but weak in artillery.&quot;Germany might also mobilize one or two mechanized formations, but at present wre have only reports of the intention to constitute such formations.Mobilization reserves for the above forces might now be sufficient, but it is improbable that a further expansion could be effected until some months after mobilization.The views of the General Staff agree in the main with those expressed in a secret report, which gives the opinion of the Belgian General Staff regarding the forces which Germany could mobilize at the present time.The British and Belgian estimates tally very closely, and confirm the view that the French General Staff estimates! of the number of divisions which German)&apos;- would put into the field at the present time are greatly exaggerated.* Reproduced in C.I.D. Paper No. 1148-B, Enclosure No. 2, page 32.f Footnote. In June 1934 General Gamelin informed the British Military Attache, Paris, that, in the opinion of the French General Staff, Germany would be able to mobilize by 1935 an army of 100 divisions, composed as under: Forty-two Keichsheer divisions formed by duplicating the &quot;existing&quot; divisions on mobilization;The equivalent of seven or eight divisions formed mainly from the Police, with the addition of a number of picked S.A. and S.S. personnel; and fifty Grenzechutz (Frontier Defence) divisions (thirty-five on the Eastern and fifteen on the Western frontier).By April 1935 Germany would have the &quot;military instrument&quot; necessary to enable her-to wage war.
&quot;(e) Time Factor.Our Military Attache, Berlin, considers that by April 1935 the German air force and army will have reached a stage of development which the German military authorities hope will prove a serious deterrent to France, should a crisis over the Saar Plebiscite incline the French Government to seek a solution by the invasion of Germany.PART III.POSITION AS REGARDS GERMAN AIR REARMAMENT ONOCTOBER 1, 1934.Memorandum prepared in the Air Ministry.The following information has been received since OP. 205 (34)* was issued on the 31st July, 1934, in connection with German Air Rearmament: 2. Construction and Occuvation of Aerodromes. (Paragraph 8, Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)! &apos; Nineteen of forty-four aerodromes or seaplane stations, reported as being built or altered for service use, are already occupied by the German Air Force. Sixty-four Civil Air Ports have been earmarked for service use in time of emergency.The construction of forty-five new aerodromes has been reported during the last twelve months. As far as can be ascertained, only two are to be used for commercial purposes.3. Development of the German Air Force up to October 1934.   (Paragraph 35, Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)jFrom the many reports subsequently received there can be little doubt that the general scheme of organisation of the German Air Force, already outlined, is developing according to plan.One indication of this development is shown by the following extract from the report of a conversation held recently between the Military Attache, Berlin, and a senior German Army officer whose views may be taken as representing the general opinion of the Ministiy of Defence: &apos;&apos; He and all the Reichswehrministerium (Ministry of Defence) realised that Great Britain disliked and was Avorried by the pace at which theGerman Air Force was being developed.....they  in the Reichswehr-ministerium felt that it had been a mistake on Hitler&apos;s part originally to have allowed Goring such a free hand in the formation of a German x\ir Force, and that Hitler would be well advised to slip in now and order Goring to slow his programme down considerably, and, in addition, to decrease its offensive nature by reducing the number of bombing squadrons and substituting more fighters.&quot;4. The German Air Ministry.   (Paragraph 36, Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)!The Air Ministry has absorbed all Reichswehr departments which dealt with military aeronautics and now controls every aspect of aviation, to a degree unknown in other countries. Its very thorough organisation may be ganged from die chart showing one Department, the Air Staff (attached as Appendix &quot; A &quot;). Many Staff Officers openly wear air force uniform.5. Formation of Service Units.   (Paragraph 37, sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) (iii) and (v), Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers:)!No definite information has yet been received as to the formation of actual service squadrons. It is known, however, that six air stations, other than those believed to be schools, are now occupied by air force personnel, and it is reasonable to assume that these are combatant air force units.* Reproduced as Enclosure No. *j to 0.1.d; Paper No. 114s-b.f Reproduced on page 27 of Enclosure Xo. 2 to 0.1.1).

Thirteen schools are now believed to be in operation.7. Naval Command. (Paragraph 37, sub-paragraph (v). Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)*The Headquarters of Naval Training, three training schools, and one unit are now believed to be in existence.8. Construction of Service Aircraft. (Paragraph 37 Estimated total strength of the German Air Force by the 1st October, 1935 Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)*Day and Night Bombers, Fighters and Reconnaissance aircraft are being constructed in series under what can only be described as emergency conditions. (See Aircraft Industry Paragraph.)9. Personnel. (Paragraph 37 Estimated total strength of the German Air Force by the 1st October, 1935-Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)^The ever-increasing numbers of air force personnel are thinly camouflaged as members of the D.V.S. (Professional Pilots&apos; Schools) and wear a blue uniform somewhat similar to our own. At one aerodrome alone, a Technical Training School, the Military Attache, Berlin, recently observed between 750 and 800 of these airmen.10. Training.(i) Flying. It is estimated that 950 pupils (what proportion of Air Force personnel is unknown) were trained as pilots during 1933. While this is a 100 per cent, increase over the figures for 1932, the number trained this year is expected to show yet a further large increase.(ii) Night Flying. The amount of training in night flying that is being carried out in Germany to-day is out of all proportion to the normal requirements of her commercial aviation.11. Expansion of the German Air Force subsequent to October 1935. (Para-graphs 38 and 39, Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refer.)*Reports indicate that once the first stage of development has been reached (October 1935) the establishment of additional squadrons will begin at once. The formation of three Air Divisions, believed to be their ultimate aim, would give Germany a total first-line strength of approximately 1,500 aircraft.12. The Aircraft Industry.In paragraph 43 of Appendix II to CP. 205 (34) t it was estimated that the output of the industry was, on the 31st July, approximately : 100 aircraft per month.In view of reports of further extension to existing firms, new companies opening up and the almost general working of three shifts a day, it is now estimated that the present production has reached approximately : 140 aircraft per month.13. Bombs and Ammunition. (Paragraph 52, Appendix II of CP. 205 (34) refers.)tA report was received during August 1934 that the Air Ministry had placed -an order for 2,500 small bombs; this was stated to be part of a total order for 200,000.Air Intelligence, Air Ministry, October 9, 1934.

Copy No.1151-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.GERMAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B, Enclosure No. 2.)Note by the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligencein Foreign Countries.THE Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries has had under consideration the accompanying memorandum on the German aircraft industry, based on information received up to the 1st October, 1934.2. This memorandum brings up to date the information given in Enclosure No. 2 to C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B.3. In view of the fact that the rate of production and the number of purely military aircraft in Germany has doubled since C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B was issued in March last, the Sub-Committee are of the opinion that the Committee of Imperial Defence should be informed of the recent developments.(Signed) E. F.

this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1934.SECRET.F.C.T. 67.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries.GERMAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY. (Previous Reference: Paper No. F.C.I. 61.)Memorandum prepared by the Industrial Intelligence Centre in collaboration with the Air Staff.Estimated Activity in January 1934.1. ACCORDING to information available in February of this year, it was estimated that in December 1933 The number of hands employed in Germany on theconstruction of airframes was about ...          ... 5,000The number of hands employed in Germany on theconstruction of aero-engines was about          ... 3,000Total hands employed in the aircraft industry, about ... ...      8,000The January rate of production of the Industry was estimated at Airframes : about 60-70 per month. Aero-engines: about 90-100 per month.Recent Information.2. Recent information has been conflicting in detail, but leaves no doubt that considerable expansion of output and capacity has taken place since the beginning of the year and is still continuing.Tables are attached summarising certain aspects of reports received.Present Estimates.3.- (a) Labour Employed. Apart from hands employed in a few factories of which no reliable figures are available, the number of hands engaged on air-frame and aero-engine manufacture is estimated, on 1.10.34, to be . Airframes, about       ... ... ... ...      10,600Aero-engines, about    ... ... ... ...        4,70015,300
This represents an increase of 90 per cent, over the labour estimated and reported to be employed in December 1933.(b) Output. Estimates of the present rate of output (October 1934) vary considerably. Based on individual reports of factory activity, they are, for air-frames and aero-engines of all types, between 140-175 airframes per month. 210-250 aero-engines per month.It is interesting to compare these figures with the recently published output of the United States aircraft industry, which shows that in 1930, when employing about the same number of hands as the German industry is now believed to employ (U.S.A., 15,500; Germany, 15,300), the average monthly rate of output was 223 airframes and 313 engines.However, even if the lower estimates of Gei&apos;man output be accepted, it is seen that the monthly rate of output of airframes and aero-engines has doubled itself since the beginning of the year.Total Serviceable Aircraft.4. Prior to 1.1.34 Germany published monthly lists of newly registered civil aircraft.  Since that date these lists are so far in arrears as to be valueless.However, it may be accepted that on 1.1.34 the number of aircraft in Germany was Civil aircraft below 400 h.p., about        ...         ... 1.127Types capable of conversion to Service uses, about ... 260Total civil aircra ft      ...         ...         ...         ... 1.387Purely Service types    ...         ...         ...         ... 276Total aircraft    ...         ...         ...         ... 1,663Estimates of the total number of aircraft in existence on 1.10.34 depend on the rate of output in the past nine months, estimates of which, as already shown, vary considerably. Assuming, however, a reasonable rate of monthly rise in output from 60-70 aircraft in January to an October output of 140-175 aircraft, the total number of aircraft constructed between 1.1.34 and 1.10.34 would, it is estimated, amount to about 850 of all types.Thus, the estimated number of aircraft of all types in Germany on 1.10.34. allowing for a recognised wastage, should be about 2,300.Of this number, the Air Ministry estimate that the number of purely Service aircraft is about 550, with an additional 250 civil aircraft suitable for conversion to Service use.Capacity of Existing Plant.5. Two factors at present render it extremely difficult to assess the maximum capacity of existing plant. Fh*stly, extensions now being carried out are altering the situation rapidly; secondly, the uncertain effect of plans drawn up by the organisation Fertigung G.m.b.H. for the mass production in emergency of aircraft components by many firms other than those normally engaged upon such work.1 It seems clear, however, that the industry is now capable of immediate expansion to a capacity of 500 airframes per month, as suggested in February of this year (para. 12 of Paper No. F.C.I. 61, also C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B, Enclosure No. 2), but that the output of aero-engines still limits production of finished aircraft failing import.In addition to the above, over 250 firms are known to be engaged wholly or partially on the production of aircraft materials, components, accessories, instruments, &amp;c.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, October 25, 1934.Conclusions.6.   From the above it may be concluded (a) That the number of hands employed in the aircraft industry has nearly doubled itself as against December 1933.. and is now reported to exceed 15,000 men.(&amp;) That the rate of output has increased correspondingly, being now between 140 and 175 airframes and between 210 and 250 aero-engines per month.(c) That the number of aircraft in Germany to-day should be at least 2,300, of which about 550 are believed to be of purely Service types with about another 250 of commercial types capable of rapid conversion for Service use.

F.C.I. 65.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign  Countries.GERMANY-ARMAMENT RESERVES (excluding Warships and Aircraft).[Previous reference Paper No. F.C.I. 61.)Memorandum prepared by the Industrial Intelligence Centre in collaboration with the General Staff, War Office.1. Object of the Paper.THE size of the Force which a country can maintain in modern war is conditioned by the supply of armaments.In this paper, the information received regarding the manufacture in Germany of certain categories of armament stores has been set out, with the object of examining the size of the army which Germany might be able to put into the Field and maintain there in the near future, considering only the provision of materiel, and omitting any question of trained reserves.This examination appears the more desirable in view of an estimate communicated by the French General Staff in June of this year, which envisages much larger forces than have hitherto been considered possible (see footnote *).As a standard of comparison, the General Staff (War Office) have worked out the initial requirements of a modern army of three cavalry divisions and twenty-one divisions in certain armament stores, which are attached as an Appendix.The armament stores and materiel considered below are :  Guns,Gun ammunition, air bombs,Small arms and S.A.A.,War chemicals and explosives,Mechanised transport and Armoured Fighting Vehicles, to which is added a note on liquid fuel supply.*In June 1934 General Gamelin informed the British M.A., Paris, that, in the opinion of the French General Staff, Germany would be able to mobilize by 1935 an Army of a hundred Divisions, composed as under:  Forty-two Reichsheer Divisions formed by duplicating the &quot;existing&quot; Divisions on mobilization;The equivalent of seven or eight Divisions formed mainly from the Police, with th addition of a number of picked S.A. and S.S. personnel, and fifty Grenzsehutz (Frontier Defence) Divisions (thirty-five on the Eastern and fifteen on the Western frontier).By April 1935, Germany would have the &quot; Military instrument &quot; necessary to enable her to wage war. For this Germany would admittedly require about 15,000 pieces of artillery. According to-French information, Germanv has been turning out guns at the rate of 500 to 600 a month since the last few months of 1933/[10611] B
The important and closely related question of air armaments and the limiting factors in connection with the expansion of air armaments in Germany, are not discussed in this paper, as they have been recently considered in C.I.D. Paper No. 1134-B of the 22nd March, 1934.2. Guns.Reports received of guns held in reserve by Army artillery units leave no doubt that the number of guns in German possession in February 1933 (see footnote *) was greater than that allowed by the Treaty of Versailles. But although we have little information upon which to base a more exact estimate, we equally have no evidence at all that the Germans possessed at that date sufficient guns to equip a large army on a modern scale. It would be very surprising if, from the information in our possession, more than 1,500 guns of all calibres could then have been made available for the German army.(a) Naval and Coastal Defence.Guns held on charge by the Naval Authorities must be taken into account, not only in connection with the Fleet and Coast Defences, but since certain types, if provided with land carriages, might be transferred to the Army at need.Although the number of guns mounted in the Fleet and Coast Defences has not been materially increased since 1922, a considerable additional reserve has been formed. For instance, in November 1933 about 250 15-cm., 10-5-em. and 8-8-cm. A.A. guns were reported to be stored at the Deutsche Werke, Kiel. Moreover, there has been a steady output of guns on Naval account since then.The heavy guns concerned will probably be absorbed in proposed minor additions to the Coast Defences, and in arming the two capital ships of the Deutschland Class now under construction. There is reason to believe, however, that no great additions to the Coast Defences are contemplated, so that the greater part of this reserve may be intended for eventual use in Area Defences or for the Field Army if required. Perhaps 150-200 10 - 5-cm. guns, and 200-250 8-8-cm. A.A. guns might be provided for the Army in this way.(b) Field Guns and Field Howitzers.Considerable numbers of Field guns have been turned out in the last year or more; deliveries amounting on two occasions to about 40 per month. Recent reports indicate a continued manufacture both of field guns and field howitzers, and it would be unwise to place the number at the disposal of the German Army on the 1st April. 1935. if the present apparent rate of manufacture continues, at much below 2,000.(c) 8-8-cm. A .A. Guns.Although this gun was not manufactured in series before 1932, reports show that considerable numbers were already being turned out in the early part of 1933. In October of that year, Rheinmetall had received an order for 80 of these guns, and in July 1934 had received a running order to deliver 15 guns a month till further orders, the carriages apparently being produced by the Bochumer Verein. Thus, it is considered that by the 1st April, 1935, Germany may possess upwards of 600, if those held on Naval charge be included.(d) 7-5-6&apos;to. Close Support Howitzers.Manufacture began in 1930, but was successfully concealed for some time by the gun being described in all references to it as a trench mortar. By 1933 it was being manufactured in series. Judging by reports received, it seems probable that by the 1st April, 1935, the Germans should be able to provide all the 7-5-cm. close support howitzers required for an Army of three cavalry divisions and* Whereas preparations for intensive manufacture of armaments were undoubtedly mad6 before the entry of the Nazi party into power in February 1933, orders to commence such manu-facture do not antedate this event. Delivery of these orders appears to have begun, as regards artillery, in about September-October 1933 at the earliest; but as regards shell and certain other -armament stores, from about May-June 1933.
twenty-one Divisions, with a surplus allowing frontier defence formations to be equipped with a certain number of these weapons.(e) Medium and Heavy Guns and Howitzers.There should be no difficulty in supplying from stock the relatively few 15-cm. guns required for a large Army. Manufacture of land carriages for the 10-5-cm. gun has been reported, and a considerable stock may already exist. Although recent reports indicate no extensive manufacture of the 10-5-cm. gun itself, it may yet be possible for the Army, by the 1st April, 1935, to dispose of some 300-350, if the 150-200 guns of this type are taken into account, which, as stated above, might be replaced in the Coastal Defences by other calibres, and if a further 50-100 guns, believed to be held in reserve on Naval charge, be handed over.On the other hand, there is no good evidence of delivery of the 15-cm. howitzer in any numbers. An up-to-date pattern has been produced, and Rheinmetall is ready to manufacture. In September 1933, the management of Krupp was reported to be calculating upon reaching a monthly output of 64 pieces before the end of the 1st year of mobilisation. Special plant used for the manufacture of these howitzers in the Great War, and stored in Holland, has now been returned to dusseldorf.Remarkable as it may appear in view of other German rearmament steps known to have been taken, it seems impossible from our present information for more than a very inadequate proportion of the 15-cm. howitzers, normally required for an Army of three cavalry divisions and twenty-one divisions, to be available by the 1st April, 1935. It is interesting to note that the French IPmo Bureau have no information in refutation of this opinion.At the same time, on the basis of German schemes and exercises, it appears certain that the Germans intend to employ 15-cm. howitzers with the field army.(f) Small Calibre Guns.There have been very lai-ge deliveries of components for the 3-7-cm. and 2-cm. A.A. and A.T. guns. In the three months ending the 1st April, 1934, the factories controlled by Rheinmetall are reported to have completed 1,050 barrels for 2-cm. guns, and 563 for 3-7-cm. guns; nor is it suggested that this was the first large delivery. A later report states that Rheinmetall has received further orders for 2,000 barrels for 2-cm. guns.Bearing in mind the fact that certain types of these guns are equipped with two or more barrels, it seems possible that by the 1st April, 1935, a large number, perhaps exceeding 4,000 guns of 2-cm. and 3-7-cm. calibres, may be available.(g) If the French assumption, referred to in the Footnote to paragraph 1 of this paper, to the effect that German factories have been turning out guns at the rate of 500-600 per month since the last few months of 1933, is examined, it would appear on our information that some 80 per cent, of this output must consist of A.T. and A.A. guns of small calibre, and cannot be justified in regard to a balanced output of the various calibres required to equip an army on a modern scale.3. Gun Ammunition and Air Bombs.The Germans have no illusions as to the quantity of gun ammunition used in-modern war if, as is reported, the German General Staff estimate requirements of 8-8-cm. ammunition alone to be 800,000 rounds per month. It is also the reported intention to create a reserve of 8,000 rounds per gun for the 2-cm. A.A. gun.Though there is little or no information from which to estimate the quantity of gun ammunition available in February 1933, there may even then have been notable stocks. A recent order published by a German unit reveals that ammunition manufactured during the war is still available. This indicates that considerable quantities must have been smuggled past the Control Commission, and thereafter used for practice purposes, the greater part of the output since 1919 being put to reserve.In the summer of 1933, the reserve of heavy and medium gun ammunition for the Fleet and Coastal Defences was reported to be just under half a million [10611] B 2
rounds. There has been further manufacture of gun ammunition of these types since that date.In most cases isolated reports of orders placed can only be regarded as indicative and not as covering the whole ground. Generally speaking, these orders and the number of firms believed to have received educational orders for gun ammunition, clearly indicate that a large reserve is in process of manufacture. It is, however, significant that only restricted orders for 15-cm. howitzer ammunition have been reported.In one instance we have a report that during the whole of 1933 special explosive &quot;filling&quot; for the 3-7-cm. shell, sufficing for 674,000 rounds, was delivered by Industry to &quot;filling&quot; factories; while in the first quarter of 1934 sufficient &quot; filling &quot; for a further 855,000 rounds was delivered.In fact, if reported figures can be accepted, and output continues at the present apparent rate, there would seem to be no reason why the reserve of gun ammunition in Germany on the 1st April, 1935, should not have risen to something like 10 million rounds.There is evidence in addition that correspondingly large orders for air bombs have been placed. In the second quarter of 1934, the Bochumer Verein was reported to be working on an order for 150,000 bomb cases of magnesium alloy, of a size judged suitable for a &quot; filling &quot; of about 25 lbs. weight of explosives each. Later reports record the placing of an order for 200,000 air bombs of smaller dimensions.4. Small A rms and S.A .A.No figures of orders placed for rifle or S.A.A. components have been received. Nevertheless, a number of factories are known to have been manufacturing these stores for some considerable time past. There has been a very large demand for rifles and S.A.A. from the unauthorised forces (S.A., S.S., &amp;c), and the numerous bodies taking part in &quot;defence sport.&quot; Consequently there is little doubt that reserves of both rifles and S.A.A. are available to arm a Force considerably larger than could be equipped proportionately with artillery, not forgetting Air Force requirements in S.A.A.; while a large output could be obtained at short notice.Light automatics are now being manufactured by a number of factories, and it is not considered that the provision of light automatics will be a limiting factor in the arming of the German Forces.As regards machine guns : it was reported at the end of April 1934 that the Dusseldorf Factory of Rheinmetall alone was turning out machine guns at the average rate of 30-32 per week. Later it was reported that a firm at Spandau had delivered between January and June 1934, 5,000 sighting apparatus and breech mechanisms for machine guns. Several other factories are known to be manufacturing machine gun components, and at the apparent rate of output, taking into account previous stocks, it is considered that Germany may easily be able to dispose of 15,000 machine guns or more by the 1st April, 1935. Anyhow, there is no doubt that the provision of machine guns will not prove a limiting factor to the equipping of a considerably larger force than three cavalry divisions and twenty-one divisions, in addition to Grenzschutz and air force requirements.5. War Chemicals, Eaylosives and &quot;Filling.&quot;The strength of Germany&apos;s Chemical Industry is well known, and there is no doubt that, if assured an adequate supply of raw materials and sufficient special purpose plant where necessary, very large quantities of war chemicals and explosives could be produced at short notice.Though there is little detailed information available regarding the location and capacity of plant for producing either war gases or explosives, it is known that in 1931 the I.G.F.I., which had recently effected an amalgamation and acquired control of the German Explosive Industry, accepted responsibility for meeting specific war requirements. Further, it is reported that in 1933, the [.G.F.1. informed the Military Authorities that, if guaranteed a supply of raw materials, they were then in a position to do this.Raw materials necessary to manufacture toxic substances are obtainable within the country; while a very large output of Ammonium Nitrate is available
at any time from the German Nitrogen Industry. To meet a sudden demand for Toluol, the Government has created a reserve of 4,000 tons, which is the sort of emergency reserve which might be expected in connection with an Army of about twenty-five to thirty Divisions. It is also noteworthy that in June 1934, the Government issued a permit for the importation of 10,000 tons of cotton &quot;Linters,&quot; privately admitted to be for the manufacture of propellant.Apart from the above, the quantity of gun ammunition and S.A.A. known to have been delivered in the past year or so postulates a corresponding manu-facture of explosives, and, in general, it may be accepted that Germany should now experience no difficulty in providing explosives and war chemicals up to and beyond the present apparent rate of supply of empty shell, &amp;c.Several firms regularly manufacturing shell possess their own &apos;&apos; filling&apos;&apos; factories. Other &quot;filling&quot; facilities are reported in connection with explosive works. &quot;Filling &quot; gas shell and containers is undertaken as a rule by the I.G.F.I. manufacturing the toxic substances concerned. There is no reason to anticipate a shortage of &quot;filling &quot; capacity relative to the present rate of output of shell. There is, in addition, some indication that emergency &quot;filling&quot; factories are being organised.6. Mechanised Transport and Armoured Fighting Vehicles.Although the German Motor Vehicle Industry, lacking the export trade enjoyed by certain other countries and with a relatively low internal demand per head of the population, has a smaller annual output than, say, the United Kingdom or France, its emergency capacity is considerable. The present Government plans to &apos;&apos; mechanise &apos;&apos; the country in the interests of National Defence. This has resulted in an output of over 100,000 motor cars and 13,000 heavy buses and lorries in 1933, as against 52,000 cars and 8,000 lorries in 1932. The number of lorries produced in 1933, suitable for military purposes, was double that produced in 1932; while in June 1934, the output was greater than at any post-war period.The German Government owns a large number of motor vehicles, in addition to those on charge of the Reichsheer and the Police. According to official figures, the German Railway Company has ordered 200 six-wheel and 940 four-wheel lorries; while a further order for 720 lorries has been given in 1934. The German Postal Service has over 13,500 motor vehicles (including motor cycles); already in 1929, the Reichpost owned 3,595 motor omnibuses out of a total of 10,593 in Germany. A large number of motor vehicles is also owned by municipalities. It has been possible to standardise the types employed to a greater extent than in other countries; for example, the motor omnibuses are powerful six-wheelers of a standard type. According to a recent report, all the standardised four-wheelers can be transformed into cross-country&apos; vehicles, by replacing the two rear wheels by four cross-country wheels.The German Motor Vehicle Industry has military significance, over and above its capacity to supply mechanised transport, in view of its development of creeper track vehicles. In 1933 there were 27,500 agricultural tractors in Germany, mostly of German make, against 3,000 in the United Kingdom, mostly of American make.Germany has used this capacity as a basis on which to develop and expand the manufacture of military creeper track machines. It is significant that the Russian &quot; Kommunar &quot; Infantry Support Tank is evolved from the German Hanomag &apos;&apos; tractor. In Germany, types of civil vehicles capable of being converted rapidly into cross-country armoured fighting vehicles on mobilization are now being manufactured in quantity. Corresponding manufacture of components for conversion is also reported to be in progress at several factories, so that several hundred Infantry Close Support Tanks may be made available by this means, with the possibility of a considerable output commencing soon after mobilization has been ordered.Apart from these &quot; emergency &quot; tanks and &quot; dragons,&quot; it now seems certain that the Reichswehrministerium has adopted a 6-1-ton light tank manufactured as such, and that since the beginning of 1934 components of this tank have been turned out in series by Krupp and other firms. The total quantity on order is not known, but in January 1934 Messrs. Krupp was reported to have completed 30 of these tanks, being part of a first order for 130.   The presence of service
Gtanks with military units has now been reported, and it would be unwise to place the number of light tanks actually available at less than 250; while double that number may well be in stock in a year&apos;s time.Although there is no evidence that Reichsheer units are already equipped with modern armoured cars in any number, there is a considerable output of 6-wheeled lorry chassis, capable of conversion into armoured cars at short notice. Reports state that the Reichswehrministerium has recently placed orders for such chassis with various firms.7. Supply of Liquid Fuel.The use of mechanised transport and armoured fighting vehicles is governed by the supply of liquid fuel. Germany can produce at present some 750,000 tons per annum of petroleum products derived from the treatment of indigenous raw materials, which is, however, only 25 per cent, of peace time requirements.Foreign suppliers maintain by arrangement reserve stocks in Germany of about another 750,000 tons of petroleum products which, with the supply of petroleum, benzol, alcohol, &amp;c, available from indigenous sources, should enable the Germans to carry on without further imports for at least the first six months of war.It is worth noting that by far the greater proportion of imports of petroleum is seaborne, and that German refining capacity is little greater than that required to treat the present domestic output of crude petroleum. Imports would therefore have to be confined practically entirely to refined products.Realising their dependence upon import, the Government has recently endeavoured to persuade foreign suppliers to increase their stocks in Germany. If successful in this, the stocks available when brought up to the new standard, taken together with the possible output from domestic sources, would constitute a reserve which might suffice to meet requirements in the first year of war for Industry, for the existing Fleet, for an army of about three cavalry divisions and twenty-one divisions, and a corresponding air force.If, however, foreign suppliers of petroleum products do not fall in with the present German demands, the size of the Forces which can be maintained afloat, in the air and in the field will be severely limited failing a continuation of imports from abroad, or a greatly increased domestic supply and refining capacity.In the event of sea routes being closed, petroleum products might be obtained from Roumania and Russia by river and land transport, if the political and strategic situation allowed it.8. Conclusion.The views expressed in the foregoing paragraphs are based upon information received regarding orders and deliveries of materiel concerned. It is, therefore, of considerable interest to record, in addition, that in the Summer of 1933 very reliable information was received that Germany intended, by the end of the Financial Year 1934-35, to be in a position to equip and munition an Army of three Cavalry Divisions and twenty-one Divisions. It was stated at the time that the chief difficulty would be the inadequacy of the funds then allotted for the purpose. Since that date, considerable additional funds are reported to have been set aside for the provision of armament stores.This information lends weight to the conclusions arrived at in this paper, which are : -(a) By the 1st April, 1935, Germany may well be able to put into the fieldan Army of three Cavalry Divisions and twenty-one Divisions, armed and equipped in the most modern fashion, save in respect of medium artillery and tanks.(b) In addition, a sufficient supply of Small Arms and Field Artillery maybe available to equip a number of Frontier Defence formations which, however, will probably lack other armament and be definitely short of artillery.** The General Staff do not accept the French thesis that irregular frontier defence formations, mainly infantry, with a very low allotment of artillery, can be considered the equivalent of modern divisions of all arms&quot;.
The War Office. S.W. 1. October 11, 1934.(c) At the same time, Germany should be able to maintain the Fleet and Coastal Defences at their present strength in materiel, and may have a certain surplus of A.A. guns available for Area A.A. Defences. On our present information, it would appear that there will have to be a very considerable expansion in output of A.A. guns before all the vulnerable areas in Western Germany can be supplied with A.A. gun defences on the scale adequate to meet the danger of attack by a major air power.id) Apart from the above, there should be a sufficient supply of air bombs, machine-guns and S.A.A., &amp;c, for a first-line Air strength of at least 500 aircraft.(e) Domestic resources for the supply of liquid fuel, together with existing reserve stocks, are estimated to be sufficient to meet the requirements of Industry, the fleet, an army of about three cavalry divisions and twenty-one divisions, and a corresponding air force, for the first six months of war, without further imports. This period might be doubled, if efforts now being made to persuade foreign importers to increase the stocks they hold in Germany, prove successful.Reviewing the evidence in our possession regarding German Armament resources, it is concluded that although these resources deserve serious con-sideration, and by 1935 should suffice to mobilize and maintain the forces outlined above, it would not seem possible for the German General Staff to contemplate at that date an aggressive war of national effort with such limited forces, which would be greatly inferior to the mobilized forces of her probable enemies.Moreover, disregarding the question of trained man-power, Germany will, in our opinion, require several years of progressive expansion in armament manufacture before she could adequately equip an army of the size stated in the footnote to paragraph 1, which the French General Staff estimate might be put into the Field in 1935.

It is now expected that few, if any, super heavy guns or heavy guns and heavy (21-em.) howitzers will be included in the Field Army formations. This opinion is based on the reported views of the Reichswehr Minister (General von Blomberg).Rates of ammunition expenditure are on the low side particularly for an army which will have to make up for smallness in numbers by rapid rates of fire. The period four months for the calculation of reserves pre-supposes, moreover, an armaments industry of high initial capacity and even a modified industrial mobilization before the declaration of war.Anti-aircraft artillery makes no allowance for area anti-aircraft defences, which would be additional to the above, nor for 3-7-cm. or 2-cm. A.A. guns employed with the Field Army.Guns required for frontier defence formations are not included in the above table.The number of guns shown in column 6 is the number required to fill establishments. In addition, wastage due to wear and enemy action in the first four months of war will have to be made good. This will vary from approximately 20 per cent, of the total in the case of close support artillery (7-5-cm. guns), to 50 per cent, in the case of field artillery (10-5-cm. howitzers and 7-7-cm. guns), and as much as 180 per cent, in the case of A.A. artillery (7-5 or 8-8-cm. A.A. guns).

Ilote by the Seeretary of State for Air.I circulate for tho information of the Committee on Gorman Rearmament the accompanying Memorandum which has been prepared by the Air Staff.(Intld) L.wydyr House.Jlst November,  1934.
1. In Appendix II of C.I.JJ.  Paper 1148-B the AirStaff gave the. details of the composition and strength of the Air Force German./ had planned to have by 1st October, 1935.      It stated there that the first line strength would then be in the neighbourhood of 500 aircraft and that this figure sbouid be considered as being but one stage towards the development of an Air Force having an ultimate strength of 3 or even 4 times this total.2. The feverish haste, and the extent of the preparations, being made towards the establishment of this Air   Force are well illustrated from the two following examples of the many similar reports received lately(i) Extract from H.BtM.  Consul Leipzig1s report dated 21st Septemcer,  19345&quot;On entering Dessau by road late on the afternoon of the 13th September I was struck by the evident signs of business activity everywhere.      The main street was far more congested with pedestrians and motor-cars than one is accustomed to see in German towns of this size.      Dessau has 85,000 inhabitants.      Its main in-dustries are a sugar refinery, a railway wagon works and last hut by no means least the Junkers Y/erk A.G. ,  one of the largest aircraft factories in Europe, employing thousands of work people.      The abnormal traffic in the town was explained to menext day by the municipal architect......He told me that the housing problem inDessau was very acute.....i.that aloneduring August the population had increased by 700....  He ascribed this increase to workmen and their families who had been engaged by the Junkers Werk.      He added that practically the entire present business boom in Dessau was due to the aircraft factory which was working at high pressure in three shifts and was continually having to expand&apos;.&apos;
(ii) Extract of a report from the Consul-General, Munich, dated 23rd October,  1934.aerodrome at Neuendettelsau.11..... work is being carried on night andday and the whole forest is lit by electricity,     j\ branch railway has been built from the main line to convey the building material right up to the site. ..... New barracks are also being con-s trueted at Ansbach and here too the work is being carried on throughout the night&quot;.In connection with the latter it is of interest to note that German service aerodromes, whenever practicable,appear to be sited within woods with the object of ensuring secrecy from air or ground observation.    Further,that while formerly the construction of aerodromes was more or less confined to those required for service training schools in central Germany, recent reports showthat work is now being concentrated on aerodrome sites tothe EAST of the demilitarised zone- from the Belgian to the swiss Frontiers.3. In Part III of C.I.D. Paper 1150-B November 1934the Air Staff stated that the programme of the 1st stage of development was being carried out according to plan, that there were indications that once this had been completed the creation of additional squadrons would begin at once with the ultimate aim of reaching a strength of approximately 1,500 first line aircraft.4. Information has now been received which makes it possible to indicate the strength and details of the second stage of development towards the ultimate strength envisaged by the Air Staff last June,      This second programme is a continuation of the first and aims at giving Germany by 1.10.36 a total strength of approximately
1290   First Lino Aircraft.____7j2    Auxiliary Aircraft.TOTAL   1566   with Immediate Reserves.    Training Aircraft etc irrespective of a number of convertible civil aircraft in use on commercial air lines to the number of about 130.(It may be ncted. that the German figure of 1,296 first-line service aircraft is slightly in excess of the present first-line strength of the French Metropolitan air forces which now number 1,206 aircraft.)The 2nd Stare or (1936 Plan) of the German Air Force.5.

It appears that area commands will &quot;be responsible forthe aerodromes, depots, auxiliary services and possiblyanti-aircraft defences situated within their area.     At thepresent date (November 1954) the following number ofmaintenance units have been reported;-5 Air Ordnance Depots 1 Stores Depot 9 Aircraft Parks.This list must, however, be considered as incomplete, (iii) Schools Command.All schools, as shown below, will be administered bya schools command coming directly under the Air Ministry.9 Plying Training Schools2 Fighter Schools4 Bomber Schools (one naval)5 Machine-gun Schools (one naval)4 Observer Schools (one naval)1 Technical Training School.The Arm:/ Co-operation and Coastal or Naval Cc-operation Commands.6.      It is not yet clear which service will exercise operational control of these commands. (i) Army Co-operation Command.This command will consist of army co-operation formations and units and by the 1st October,  19 36, will consist of:-4 Army Co-operation Wing Headquarters 10     &quot; ,!
