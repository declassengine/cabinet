THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT.1.    The drought since the Spring of 1933 has been the most severe test of our water administration since accurate records have been kept.     Water undertakers,  aided by the special powers of the Water Supplies (Emergency Shortage Orders) Act, 1934, have withstood the test well, and in only a few urban areas has there been any hardship.     Rural districts have suffered more, the drought having emphasised, the need for better permanent supplies .      These rural needs are now-being met by the Government&apos;s  1,000,000 grant.      /pGrant has been promised for schemes estimated to cost  1,725,000, and schemes to a further estimated cost of  750,000 are being-considered;    in addition during the last 7 months  350,000 has been sanctioned for loans for rural schemes without grants2.    The experience of the drought has emphasized the need, which has long; been felt, of better organisation of water resources, by *,nc rationalisation of administrative areas so as to bring them into closer correspondence with natural areas, and by better control of access to sources of supply;    of more effective planning of future schemes of water supply between undertakers with common interests in sources of supply;    of the more ocpaitable distribution of water in streams and rivers -between water undertakers and riparian interests;    and of the modernisation of the Waterworks Clauses Act .3.    There is a basis for some of the provisions needed in a report of the Ministry1s Advisory Committee on Water, issued in 1925,  in which they recommended that in areas to be scheduled after public inquiry wells and borings  (including97CRET .F.242(34) ..A B I N E T .C o py No.Water services .Memorandum by the Minister of Health.
mines) should he prohibited without the MinistryTs approval:    and in a report of the Committee issued in 1930 on Compensation Water, in which the conclusion was that the present method of assessment, first adopted 70 years ago, operates unfairly on water undertakers in many instances and results in effect in a waste of water resources,  and an alternative method was proposed.      We have also a report issued by the Commit tee in 1929 which reviews the existing law relating to water supply, and in particular,  the Waterworks Clauses Act, which dates from 1847, and is now out of date.      The Committee recommended that a consolidated code should he included in a new Waterworks Clauses Act.4.        Legislation on these subjects is overdue and is highly desirable.      Some of the measures needed, especially those relating to the rationalisation of administrative areas, to the control of access to sources,  and to compensation water, raise major issues of policy, and are very controversial.      Pressure of business no doubt renders such legislation in the coming session impracticable.      In the circumstances, I should propose, with the approval of the Cabinet,   to prepare a white Paper  (which would of course be submitted to the Cabinet for approval) summarising the measures contemplated by the Government;, and then to present it and move for its consideration by a Joint Select Committee of both Houses, in the light of whose report a bill would be prepared.      The procedure would provide an appropriate means of ventilating the case of the interests involved in the major issues raised, before the final formulation of our proposals;    and it would be particularly appropriate as to the minor proposalso(L *
(Intld.) E.H.Y.2nd November,  1934.of the Advisory Committee, which for the most part relateto matters commonly brought before Parliament in private bills .At present what is needed,  if my colleagues agree, is preliminary approval for the suggested procedure.      If it be decided that the procedure is appropriate, the next step would be the preparation of a White Paper setting out the actual proposals, and its submission to the Cabinet for approval.
