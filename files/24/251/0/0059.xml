THIRTEENTH REPORT.The co-ordination of trade policy.IN June last, the Prime Minister asked us to undertake an inquiry into the co-ordination of different industrial and agricultural considerations in formu-lating trade policy; and in accordance with these instructions we now submit a report on this subject.2. Our present report is therefore of a different character from the surveys of the economic situation which we submit periodically. It represents an attempt to formulate, in response to the Prime Minister&apos;s request, certain broad principles which should govern our commercial and agricultural policy; and it is confined to the consideration of these questions in their broadest and most general character. We do not attempt to pass judgment upon the merits of the detailed measures which have been adopted in different fields; and we have therefore obtained no information from those responsible for the conduct of such measures.3. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.4. In sections 1 and 2 of the present Report we refer to certain introductory considerations and describe briefly the changing international background. In section 3 we discuss the export trade, and in section 4 the relation between exports and imports. In section 5 we discuss employment and agriculture. A brief summary of our principal conclusions is given in section 6.(Signed on behalf of the committee) :J. C. STAMP, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, October 23, 1934.[10642]
THE CO-ORDINATION OF  TRADE POLICY.1. Introductory.THE economic development of Great Britain in the Victorian age was based in a peculiar degree on overseas trade and overseas investment. The heavy-industries, coal, iron and steel, engineering and ship building, textile industries, such as cotton and wool, and such services as shipping and finance, all depended largely, and some preponderantly, on export and international trade; and these were the activities which expanded most rapidly, and which came to be regarded as the characteristic expressions of our economic life. So much was this so, that the growth of industries catering primarily for the home market bore the appearance of being a mere by-product of the growth of our overseas trade. Although in the last few decades before the war the competition of other industrial countries was becoming a subject of increasing concern, the volume of our overseas trade continued to expand right up to the war.2. The development of our export trade was closely associated with overseas investment and emigration. A substantial part of the annual savings of the British public was invested in the development of the productive resources of remote continents, especially of the countries of the new world; and the flow of capital to the new world went hand in hand with migration on a large scale from Great Britain and other European countries. The economic intercourse which was thus developed wa&apos;s&apos;mutually advantageous in a high degree. It enabled the new countries to obtain both the capital equipment which was essential to the development of their resources, and the industrial products which were essential for maintaining their people in civilised conditions, neither of which they could have supplied for themselves economically or on a sufficient scale. Equally, it enabled Great Britain to obtain abundant supplies of food for her growing population and abundant supplies of raw materials for her growing manufactures, which she could not have produced at home at any reasonable cost. Again, in the nineteenth century, the migration of capital and population was advantageous to everyone concerned. The migrants who settled overseas and the savings that were invested in the development of new countries both earned, as a rule, a higher reward than they could have obtained if they had stayed at home, and their movement enabled the labour and capital which did remain at home to earn a higher reward also.3. The process of developing the new world with the capital, population and industrial products of the old was indeed one of the outstanding features of the economic life of the Victorian age. In this process, Great Britain played, on the side of the old wrorld, the leading part, having for a considerable period no serious competition, and it was to this fact that the rapidity of her economic progress was largely attributable. The growth of British export trade was not, of course, confined to the new world, but extended to every market. It was, however, in the trade with young and rapidly growing countries that the advantages of an international division of labour were most conspicuous.4. The rapid growth of overseas trade was associated with the pursuit by Great Britain of a free trade policy. For a considerable period after the repeal of the corn laws, the wisdom of this policy was not seriously questioned; for, owing to our industrial pre-eminence, practically no British industry, as distinct from agriculture, suffered seriously from foreign competition in the home market. As other countries became formidable industrial competitors, while showing no disposition to imitate our free trade example, the wisdom of this policy came to be the subject of acute internal controversy. But the vital importance to Great Britain of a large and developing overseas trade was not called in question. Pre-war fiscal controversy was concerned largely with the best means of promoting this objective in a world of growing tariffs.
5. The position which our overseas trade had reached before the war was as follows : Our imports, for the average of the four pre-war years 1910-13, amounted, after deducting re-exports, to  611 millions per annum. Our exports of commodities for the same period amounted to  474 millions per annum, leaving a visible import surplus of  137 millions. But our exports of services (i.e., the net receipts due to us in respect of shipping freights, financial commissions, &amp;c.) had reached an annual figure of appreciably over  100 millions. Thus our exports of goods and services together nearly sufficed to pay for our imports. In addition, we received a large annual income, as interest, dividends, &amp;c, upon our overseas investments, amounting to about  200 millions. This gave us a large credit balance of not much short of  200 millions, available and used for fresh overseas investment. These figures relate, of course, to a period of active world trade. In the difficult years of the nineties, the average margin available for fresh overseas investment was for a long time less than  30 millions, and our foreign lending was upon a very reduced scale. In effect, the variations in our volume of overseas lending served as an adjusting factor in our balance of payments. In a period of world depression, the consequential decline in our exports and shipping receipts went hand in hand with a diminished flow of fresh overseas investment, so that our imports of food-stuffs were maintained without disturbance. Conversely, in times of good world trade, the favourable balance of payments accruing from a rapid expansion of our exports was adjusted without disturbance by an increase in overseas lending.6. In the post-war decade our exports were seriously curtailed. Although, owing to the rise in prices, their value was larger than before the war, their volume, according to the Board of Trade estimate, never reached more than about S3 per cent, (in the best year, 1929) of the pre-war volume. Moreover, although in the last half of the decade, international trade was growing fairly rapidly in the %world as a whole, the degree of resilience displayed by British exports was comparatively disappointing. The unemployment of the post-war period was mainly attributable to the loss of export trade which was concentrated on the old-established industries such as coal and cotton. Meanwhile, the volume of our imports rose to a higher level than before the war and continued to grow steadily. Accordingly, our balance of trade became more adverse, despite the fact that the &quot; terms of trade&quot; moved in our favour, i.e., that the prices of the goods we exported rose more than the price of our imports.   The following wasthe position for the average of the years 1925-29 :   millions.Retained imports ... ... ... ...      1,124Exports ... ... ... ... ... 727Visible adverse balance ... ... ... ... 397Net receipts from services (shipping, finance, Govern-ment receipts, &amp;c.) ... ... ...        213Net income from overseas investments    ... ...        250This left a credit balance available for fresh overseas investment of well under  100 millions on the average, as compared with nearly  200 millions before the war, despite the fall which had taken place in the value of money. This might have been an adequate margin if the period had been one of stagnant world trade with comparatively small demands from overseas upon the British capital market. In fact, however, world trade expanded during these years, and international lending assumed abnormally large dimensions. In these circumstances, with the machinery of the City of London equipped for lending on the larger pre-war scale, there was a prevailing tendency for our overseas loans to exceed the credit margin available for the purpose, the balance being rectified for the time being by what was in effect short-term borrowing, represented by the accumulation of foreign short-term balances in London. This caused a latent weakness in our exchange position which assumed serious importance in the ensuing slump.7. The slump led quickly to a further serious fall in the volume of British exports, and also in our receipts from services such as shipping and finance. Our imports though they declined largely in value owing to the fall in prices fell comparatively little in volume; and before long our adverse balance of trade
grew to such dimensions that a serious debit balance on international account was substituted for the credit balance which we had hitherto enjoyed. The following figures give the picture for the years of the depression : Table 1. The balance of payments.(  millions)	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.Retained imports Exports	966 579	806 397	658 371	637 372Visible adverse balance Net receipts from services, &amp;c____ Net income from overseas investments ...	386 194 220	408 134 170	287 86 145	264 105 155Credit (4-) or debit (-) balance (apart from gold movements)	4-   28	- 104	-   56	-     48. The adverse balance of payments was an important factor in the circum-stances which led to the fall of the pound in 1931; and to rectify it became for a considerable period the leading preoccupation of our economic policy. This preoccupation&apos; supplied the final impulse to the abandonment of the policy of Free Trade, which had already been qualified in the post-war decade, for example, by the McKenna and Safeguarding duties, and by small concessions of imperial preference. Various other considerations, however, contributed to the same result. The difficulties experienced in balancing the Budget despite very high rates of direct taxation, strengthened the argument against neglecting the revenue to be obtained from the extended system of import duties. Foreign competition was making serious inroads into the home markets of a growing range of British industries, giving rise to much unemployment which could be prevented by the adoption of protection. The difficulties experienced by British industries in holding their own in world markets strengthened the attraction of the idea of securing our position in Empire markets by developing the system of imperial preference. The growing complexity and subdivision of the tariff schedules of the other countries strengthened the possibility that we might be able to secure more favourable tariff treatment for our exports, if we had tariffs of our own to bargain with, than by relying solely on the most-favoured-nation clause. Finally, the tremendous fall in the world prices of many commodities made it evident that important sections of our economic life might be threatened with ruin if they were left entire by at the mercy of abnormal and unregulated competition from abroad. This consideration applied especially to agriculture: and its importance grew in the period following the abandonment of the Free Trade system. This gave rise to the idea of controlling imports in the interests of order and stability, an idea which derived support from the growing popularity of the slogan of &quot; planning.&quot;9. Thus the commercial policy which has been evolved in the last three years has been directed to the promotion of the following distinct objectives : (1) The improvement of our balance of trade. (2) Revenue.(3) The increase of employment by securing the home production of goodspreviously imported. (4) Economic co-operation within the Empire.(5) The strengthening of our position for bargaining with other countries for the reduction of their tariffs and other restrictions upon British goods.(6) Safeguarding the stability of British industry and agriculture against the vicissitudes of world fluctuations.
10. Starting as we did from an essentially free trade position, there was for a time no serious conflict between these various objectives. But there are obvious possibilities of conflict when the measures adopted for one or other of these purposes are pushed beyond a certain point. The object of this report is to consider these possible conflicts, and to suggest the principles which should govern policy in reconciling them. In attempting this task, we think it desirable to confine ourselves, so far as possible, to considerations of the broadest and most general character. We do not attempt to pass judgment upon the merits of the detailed measures which have been adopted in different fields; and we have therefore obtained no information from those responsible for the conduct of such measures. We regard it as our function to formulate as clearly as possible certain broad principles which, in our judgment, have a vital bearing upon the problems of commercial policy, and to indicate the criteria which should be used in applying them to particular cases, leaving it to others to work out their application.2. The changing international background.11. In order to view the problems that arise in their true perspective, it is desirable in the first place to appreciate certain fundamentally important changes which are taking place in the conditions which constitute the background of international trade. Everyone is aware that the forces of economic nationalism are in the ascendant throughout the world; and that a tendency prevails, seriously intensified for the time being by the circumstances of the depression, towards the heightening of tariff barriers and the creation of fresh obstacles to international trade. Equally familiar is the fact that the position of semi-monopoly as an exporter of industrial goods which Great Britain enjoyed in the early Victorian period has disappeared, and also the likelihood that the competition to which our industries are exposed in world markets is likely to become increasingly severe as the process of industrialization spreads throughout the world. But, to appreciate the full significance of these tendencies, it is necessary to take account of another change, more fundamental in character and of the broadest secular significance.12. This is the fall in birth-rates which has occurred in the past two generations in Great Britain and other western countries, and is spreading rapidly throughout the western world. Already this has served to reduce the annual growth of population in Great Britain to a low figure. The flow of migration from Great Britain to the countries of the new world had also largely declined even before the world slump began. The check to emigration up to the present is mainly attributable to other causes than the decline in the British birth-rate. But the trend of our population figures makes it difficult to suppose that the pre-war process of large-scale migration would revive, even if the other obstacles were overcome.13. For the fact that the aggregate population of Great Britain is still upon the increase obscures recognition of the virtually inevitable prospect that it will decline before long with considerable rapidity. This statement, it should be observed, does not rest upon any assumption that the average size of families will be still further restricted, though it seems possible that this may occur. The factor of age composition interposes a long time-lag between the establishment of fertility rates, incapable of maintaining the population, and the actual decline of aggregate numbers. The number of children born in Great Britain still slightly exceeds the number of persons who die, because the aged persons, of whom the latter is largely composed, were born in days when our births were still .far below their maximum annual total, which was reached about the turn of the century. But the number of babies born each year is already less than the number of persons of, say, between thirty and thirty-one years of age; so that even if none of the former were to die in the meantime, there will necessarily be fewer persons of the latter age in thirty years&apos; time than there arc to-day. In other and technical language, the gross reproduction rate of Great Britain is actually below unity. Still more so the net reproduction rate, which takes account of the probable mortality. The position may be expressed by saying that, for every four adults now alive in a particular age-group, we can only expect three a generation hence from the children now being born.
14. It may be useful to indicate the striking nature of the impending decline of our population, by reproducing part of a calculation in a recent number of the Sociological Revieiv.*   This calculation yields the following result:  Table 2.Estimated future population of Great Britain.(In hundreds.)Ages.	1931.	1936.	1941.	1946.	1951.	1956.	1966.	1976.0-15	10,840,6	10,067,1	8,791,3	7,610,7	6,621,2	5,917,9	5,048,2	4,106,115-45	21,05-2,6	21,356,5	21,633,0	21,221,4	20,219,4	18,693,8	15,261,4	11,962,245-65	9,730,0	10,080,7	10,288,9	10,550,4	11,061,3	11,688,0	11,953,0	10,914,765 4-	3,210,3	3,639,8	4,128,6	4,507,6	4,770,0	4,893,9	5,259,1	5,728.9Total .	. 44,833,5	45,144,1	44,839,8	43,890,1	42,671,9	41,193,6	37,521,7	32,711,9Thus, according to this calculation, our population is likely to fall by more than a quarter in little more than forty years from now, and, indeed, the population under 45 by more than a half. Indeed, only a decided and early reversal of the present trend towards smaller families can prevent a very substantial decline.15. This phenomenon is by no means peculiar to Great Britain. While the fall of the birth-rate has gone somewhat further in Great Britain and the net reproduction rate has sunk somewhat lower than perhaps in any other country, the position is broadly the same throughout practically the whole of western civilisation. The following table is taken from Kuczynski&apos;s The Balance of Births and Deaths.Table 3.Net reproduction rate in western and northern Europe.Country.	1925.	1926.	1927Denmark   ...	1 19	1-10	1 03England and Wales	1 05	0-88	0-82Finland	115	1 09	France	0-94	0-94	0-91Germany   ...	0-94	0-89	0-83Sweden		0-95	. . .Thus the reproduction rates of Germany, France, and Sweden, like our own, had fallen, by 1927 or earlier, below unity, i.e., below the level that would suffice to reproduce the existing population. Since the fall of birth-rates has continued steadily since 1927, it is probable that the same is now true of Denmark and Finland. The position in the United States and throughout the British Dominions (apart from the French-speaking section of Canada) is not materially different. Even in countries like Italy, where the net reproduction rate still remains well above unity, it is falling with a rapidity which suggests that this condition may prove short-lived. In contrast, there is no clear sign that any similar tendencies have begun as yet to affect the East; while in Japan the population is increasing at a rate comparable with that of Great Britain in the Victorian age, and is certain to continue to increase rapidly for a considerable period to come.16. We are thus faced, in the fall of the birth-rate in western countries, with a phenomenon of secular importance and of international scope, the consequences of which are as yet only in an early stage of their development. In connection with almost every branch of policy, it is important to adjust our minds to the repercussions which this fundamental change is certain to exert.   It may* See Leybourne, G. C, April 1934, the Sociological Review 26 (2): 130-138. The estimates of population in this paper are made on the assumptions that: (a) fertility rates will continue to decline till 1944 and then stabilise; (b) mortality rates will remain as at present; (c) there is no migration.
serve in many ways to increase the possibilities of a higher standard of living. But in this report, we are concerned only with the bearing of the decline of population upon the future of international trade and international economic life.17. In the first place, we must expect that the further extension of the international division of labour between the old world and the new, along the lines of exchanging the industrial products of the former for the primary products of the latter, which played, as was indicated in paragraphs 1-3, a central part in our development in the Victorian era, will in future be greatly retarded. With our population already virtually stationary and destined shortly to decline, the market which Great Britain provides for primary products from overseas cannot continue to show that capacity for steady and rapid expansion which the newer countries, and in particular the Dominions, have hitherto taken for granted as the basis of all their projects for development. It is true that the consumptive power per head of the British people may be expected to grow, with the improvement in the standard of living which will come from further technological progress. But as people become better-oft&apos;, they usually spend only a small part of their additional incomes upon artices of food, while the increase in their consumption of commodities of any kind is usually less in proportion than the increase in their consumption of services, which create a relatively small demand for raw materials. Until our population begins actually to decline, the growth in incomes per head may be expected, of course, to keep our aggregate consumption of primary products upon the increase; and this increase may well be considerable in the years that lie immediately ahead as we recover from the world depression.18. Apart, however, from the ups and downs associated with trade fluctuations, the rate of increase in the British consumption of primary products will almost certainly prove from now on, far smaller than it used to be, and may disappear altogether a couple of decades hence. Much the same may be expected to hold true of the consumption of western industrial countries as a whole. It is, of course, possible that a largely increased consumption of primary products might come from the populations of the Far East, particularly if conditions were established which permitted the development of a higher and more varied standard of life among eastern peoples. Subject, however, to this possibility, the outlook which confronts the newer countries as regard the markets for their primary products is unpromising. Meanwhile, the progress of agricultural technique is steadily reducing the number of persons required to produce a given volume of primary products; so that the newer countries are likely to find it increasingly difficult to maintain the numbers of their people engaged in primary production. Furthermore, the trend of population in Western Europe makes it extremely unlikely that large-scale emigration to the new world will revive. Moreover, with low birth-rates of their own in many cases, with immigration curtailed, and with difficult problems of economic adjustment to face, the new countries are unlikely to provide attractive outlets for the investment of capital from overseas on anything approaching the pre-war scale.19. Secondly, the revolutionary change in the population outlook, however advantageous it may prove in other ways, gives reason to fear that disturbances of world prices may in future be more serious and more prolonged than they used to be. A temporary condition of over-production of certain commodities occurred often enough in the last century, and might give rise to serious setback, trouble and loss. But when the trend of population was strongly upwards and when accordingly the number of persons throughout the world, who constituted the effective market for each particular commodity, was increasing rapidly from year to year, the condition of over-production was necessarily transient. Demand was soon raised by its strong secular growth until it caught up with productive capacity, and this helped to set limits to the fall in prices which the temporary state of over-production entailed. But there is no similar inevitable relief from the side of demand when the number of consumers is stationary or declining. The demand for a particular commodity may or may not possess a secular growth, according as it is a commodity upon which people, as they become better-off, spend a large or a small portion of the increase in their incomes. If there is no con-siderable upward trend of demand, equilibrium can only be restored, once a [10612] c
condition of over-production has been reached, by the permanent curtailment of productive capacity. But this is always an extremely difficult process, and in manv cases, notably in that of primary products, an extremely slow one. For, as the present depression has illustrated, the producers of primary commodities are apt, when their selling prices have fallen disastrously, to endeavour desperately to increase their incomes by increasing the volume of their production.20. This consideration serves to emphasise the sixth of the objectives which we enumerated in paragraph 9, that, namely, of securing a measure of stability to established economic interests in face of the vicissitudes of world markets. At first sight this has the appearance of an exceptional and short-period necessity, attributable to a quite abnormal economic crisis. But it may well prove that crises of comparable severity will recur frequently in future; so that it may be desirable that we should evolve permanent arrangements for dealing with such emergencies as they occur.3. The export trade.21. It follows from the analysis of the preceding section that the future outlook for our export trade is far from promising. For the time being, it is faced with all the difficulties resulting from the multiplication of trade obstacles throughout the world, with the result that the volume of our exports in 1933 was only 64 per cent, of the volume of 1929, and only 53 per cent, of the volume of 1913. While there has been a slight recovery in our export volume in the past year, it has been very slight, in marked contrast with the substantial degree of recovery that has been effected in our domestic trade.22. Nor perhaps is the outlook very much brighter when we look somewhat further ahead. Owing to the depression, the volume of world trade has sunk well below the level which may be anticipated in a period of greater activity; and even if, as seems probable, there is no very speedy or substantial relaxation of the trade obstacles which have been set up in the last few years, the volume of world trade will expand as activity revives. British exporters, however, may not share in this increase to its full extent. For our competitive position, vis-a-vis other industrial countries, has been perhaps exceptionally favourable in recent years, owing to the fact that sterling has fallen while many of our principal competitors in Europe have remained on gold. It is possible that these countries may in the comparatively near future decide on devaluation, with the result that another obstacle would be thrown in the way of our exports to them, while competition in neutral markets would be intensified. Thus against the recovery in the volume of international trade which may be expected to ensue from an improvement in the world situation, we have to set a disappearance of the comparatively favourable competitive position which we enjoy at present.23. Most of the difficulties which hampered our staple export trades in the last decade still remain. The demand for British coal has been permanently reduced by the development of competing coal fields and competing sources of power. Many textile industries are already suffering from the competition of Asiatic producers, and this is likely to be soon extended into fields which have hitherto escaped. Moreover, behind these detailed facts there lie the broad considerations which were dealt with in the preceding section, namely, that we have lost the position of quasi-monopoly as an industrial exporter which we enjoyed in the nineteenth century, and that the process of extending the division of labour between the new world and the old is approaching a phase of exhaustion. These considerations cloud especially the outlook for the old-established exporting industries.24. British economic life has adapted itself to the heavy loss of export trade with a degree of success that would have been deemed incredible before the loss occurred. In pre-war days, it would have been regarded as out of the question that Great Britain, with her dependence on imported food, with the pride of place in her industrial life attaching to such industries as coal and cotton, with her pre-eminence in shipping, with the City of London largely concerned with the finance of international trade, could lose not far short of one-half of her
export trade and remain a prosperous country. Yet, in fact, since 1913 we have succeeded in maintaining a standard of life, which is probably to-day, upon the whole, about as high as it has ever been, and, in absorbing in employment the greater part of the annual increase, which up to date has been substantial, in the population of working age. Indeed, heavy as our unemploy-ment is, we stand out once more to-day, despite our loss of export markets, as clearly the most prosperous of the principal countries of the world.25. This experience has given rise not unnaturally to a disposition to question whether the development of exports is so important or even so desirable as used to be assumed. We think it well, therefore, to consider objectively how far the interests of Britain are really dependent on international trade, taking account first of the reasons that can be urged on the side of scepticism.26. The progress of science, it is sometimes argued, and the spreading of industrial methods and aptitudes throughout the world, are tending more and more to reduce the advantages of international specialisation. Increasingly, international trade, if unimpeded by tariff or other obstacles, takes the form of the importation by one country of goods which it could produce at home almost as efficiently, and perhaps, after a brief interval, quite as efficiently as the country from which it obtains them, in exchange for goods for the production of which it has again no very marked or inherent superiority. The mutual benefit derived from such exchanges is inconsiderable; the curtailment of international trade of this character need entail, therefore, no very serious loss.27. On the other hand, the argument proceeds, it may entail a substantial gain under the heading of stability. For the conduct of international trade is exposed to the perpetual menace of disturbance. In proportion as a country engages in foreign trade, it hazards the fortunes of its industries, the employment of its workpeople, the general stability of its economic life, on the conditions and the policies pursued in other countries. It may be seriously injured, for example, by the sudden raising of tariffs or by an exchange crisis in some country abroad. The more extended is its international trade, the more vulnerable does it become to vicissitudes over which it can have no control.28. Again, it is argued that, in so far as the export trade of a country is attributable to the making of foreign loans or investments, the trade may prove to be bad business for the country as a whole, if the borrowers subsequently default or the investments prove unprofitable. Upon this point, it should be observed that, contrary perhaps to the prevailing impression, the experience of the present slump affords little ground for anticipating such a result. Hitherto defaults on foreign loans have reached only small proportions, and the investors who placed their money abroad have probably on the average suffered no greater diminution of income than they would have done had they invested it at home.29. There is in our judgement a considerable measure of force in these arguments. It would, we believe, be bad policy to subordinate every other consideration to the pursuit of the goal of the maximum possible volume of export trade. Our essential interests can probably be adequately secured by a volume of exports materially smaller in relation to our total production than we were accustomed to maintain in pre-war days.30. But there are various reasons why we are convinced that the maintenance of a large-scale export trade is vital to our national prosperity. In the first place, large imports of food-stuffs and raw materials are essential to us, unless we are ready to accept a much lower standard of living. Nor can we expect to continue to obtain these food-stuffs and raw materials indefinitely at the low-prices- which have prevailed in recent years. In paragraph 7 above, there are set out the Board of Trade figures of the balance of payments for the years of the depression. These figures show that even in 1933 we had a small debit balance on international income account despite the facts that the prices of the goods we import have fallen much more than those of the goods we export and that our imports of such manufactured goods as we could easily produce at home have- been drastically curtailed by protective measures. Moreover, it remains true that many countries need the assistance of foreign capital for their[10642] &apos; c 2
development, and that Great Britain has a large annual volume of savings from which this need could be satisfied with advantage to this country. For this and other reasons, it is desirable to contemplate a resumption of overseas investment as more normal conditions return, though doubtless on a much smaller scale than formerly. For this purpose, we shall need to maintain a credit margin on the balance of payments. Accordingly, a substantial recovery in the volume of British exports is likely to prove essential in the long run, if we are to avoid exchange difficulties.31. Secondly, as the result of our development in the nineteenth century, our economic life is still specialised in a large degree in occupations connected with export. Many of the industries which are most dependent on export are highly localised in character, so that to transfer their workpeople to other occupations represents a task of peculiar difficulty. Considerable progress was in fact made in the twenties in developing compensatory avenues of employment, as is indicated by the figures in table 5 below. But the obstinate continuance of large-scale unemployment during this period, and the emergence of the phenomenon of the distressed areas, show how formidable will be our problems of adjustment, if the exports of the staple exporting industries should fail to display any resilience as the depression passes away.32. Moreover, for many of the occupations which are associated with export and international trade, we are peculiarly well-fitted by reason partly of long-established organisation and partly of inherent advantage. Our geographical position as an island at the door of Europe, with excellent harbours, and with abundant coal-supplies located near the coast, remains an asset of substantial value for international trade in general, and makes natural and appropriate our long-established pre-eminence in shipping and shipbuilding. The prestige of London as an international financial centre represents the result of the evolution of centuries, in which our assured political stability and the advantages of our national character&apos;have plaj^ed an essential part. Our political position as the centre of a world-wide Empire supplies us in important markets with a valuable -measure of good-will. These are all advantages which we should endeavour to utilise and exploit. Great Britain is the last country which could wisely pursue a policy looking in the direction of self-sufficiency or autarky.33. For these various reasons we conclude that a revival of British exports is, subject to the qualifications of paragraph 29, of vital importance to British economic life. We turn to consider what conditions may be necessary, as regards our commercial and agricultural policy, to secure this object against the back-ground of the unfavourable circumstances indicated in paragraphs 21-23. We do not discuss the influence which policy in other fields, such as monetary and financial affairs, might exert upon exports.34. In the first place, important though their interests are, it would be a mistake to envisage the problem exclusively in terms of the older staple types of exports. In these cases, the higher standard of life which the British people enjoy, as compared with most of their industrial rivals, serves necessarily as a competitive handicap, which is especially serious in industries in which we have no very decided technical superiority.- The longer that an industry has been estab-lislied the more apt is its technique to become stabilised and capable of effective imitation by countries at an early stage of industrial development where labour costs rule low. It is essential, therefore, if we are to maintain the vitality of our export trade, that we should keep in the van of new developments, so as to obtain compensation in fresh lines of trade for the old lines that we lose to lower-wage competitors. For this purpose, the higher standard of living which we enjoy is an advantage. The larger purchasing-power of our population supplies a more promising market for the development of new varieties of goods; and the country which first produces a commodity on a considerable scale for its home population, acquires for subsequent export purposes the advantage of the first start over its competitors.35. It should be our aim to utilise this potential advantage in the develop-ment of our export trade.    Our progress in this respect in the twenties was
perhaps somewhat disappointing. We may recall the words of the Economic Mission to the Argentine in 1929 : &apos;&apos; The decrease in the British percentage and increase in the American has been caused not so much by the displacement of old trades as by the development of new trades, in which we have taken an insignificant share.&quot;&quot;x&quot; TP %r -h-&apos;&apos; The large Argentine demand is for the new commodities of commerce and we do not supply them. Either we do not make them or we do not market them; at least not on the scale worthy of our position as an industrial and exporting nation. Yet this demand absorbs the fresh purchasing power and diverts a large portion of the old. The average Argentine household thinks more now in terms of motor cars, gramophones and radio sets than of Irish linen, Sheffield cutlery and English china and glass. The expenditure on new luxuries has diverted money which would otherwise have gone to the staple trades. The rapid increase in United States trade in the Argentine market is particularly marked in the new industries motor cars and accessories, films and cinematograph goods, electrical appliances, radio apparatus, type-writers, cash registers and office appliances, sewing machines, domestic refrigerators, gramophones, new types of agricultural and road-making machinery, oil-well plant and supplies.&quot;American exports to all countries of goods mentioned in the last sentence of the above quotation accounted in 1929 for nearly 40 per cent, of their exports of finished manufactures or for nearly  200 millions, of which motor cars and accessories amounted to  124 millions.36. In the case of many of these commodities, American costs of production are far lower than our own. The predominance of American exporters in these fields was due to causes which contributed greatly to English industrial pre-dominance in the nineteenth century. America has been, as England was then, the most prosperous nation in the world. Commodities, the demand for which in other countries is confined to the more well-to-do classes, are there in use among a very much larger section of the community, and are more cheaply produced upon a much larger scale than is possible elsewhere. If the people of Great Britain are permanently to enjoy a standard of comfort not greatly below that prevailing in the United States, it must be by taking every opportunity to obtain a fuller share of foreign markets in these new luxuries, so soon as demand in this country has developed sufficiently to support a reasonably efficient industry. For in a large measure the remuneration of British labour, in terms of the goods which must necessarily be imported from abroad, will depend on its power to produce at prices competitive with those of other advanced countries, commodities which the industrially less advanced nations are unable to produce cheaply. This consideration supplies an argument in favour of a commercial policj^ which would secure the development of the home manufacture of new varieties of goods which we are naturally well-fitted to produce.37. Secondly, the events of recent years suggest that it may be desirable to concentrate mainly on the promotion of our export trade in markets which are not likely to subject it at any time to sudden and harassing disturbance. These are likely to be countries, our trade with which has a strongly complementary character. This supplies an argument in favour of cultivating friendly economic relations alike with the Dominions and with the Scandinavian and South American countries.38. There remains a condition which is essential to the maintenance of an adequate export trade, namely, that our costs must be such as to enable our industries to hold their own against the competition of other countries. This brings us to the heart of the problem before us. We cannot and should not attempt to improve our general competitive position by lowering our standard of living. But we must endeavour to offset our comparatively high level of labour-costs by superior efficiency in production, in our selling organisations, and in our distributive system generally. It is important, therefore, that the protective policy of this country should not be used to shield home producers from the necessity of emulating more efficient foreign producers and that continuing efforts should be made to increase the efficiency of our staple exporting industries by
adequate organisation, both in production and marketing. Again, it is important that no expedient should be adopted for the support of agriculture which would cause a serious increase in the cost of living. With these considerations in mind, we turn to consider the general bearing of our policy in regard to imports upon our exporting prospects.4. The relation between imports and exports.39. The relationship between a country&apos;s imports and its exports is not of so precise or rigid a kind that a given reduction in its imports must entail a precisely corresponding reduction in its exports, whether reckoned in volume or in value. There is. indeed, a precise quantitative relationship between the aggregate of the payments which a country makes abroad and the aggregate of the payments which it receives from abroad. But these payments include items arising from the movements of capital, and capital movements, both long-term and short-term, may undergo large variations. The account which we have given in section I of the changes which have occurred in the balance of payments is sufficient to show how widely the relation between imports and exports may vary. In the first post-war decade, our exports declined in volume by a large percentage, while our imports increased in volume, and increased in value much more than did our exports. During the first years of the depression, our exports underwent a further sharp decline, while our imports diminished in a much smaller proportion. Since our departure from gold, our exports have been nearly maintained, while our imports have been largely curtailed. These changes have played a large part in the story of the fall of sterling from gold parity, and its subsequent recovery of underlying strength.40. Nor is it only as a temporary matter that the relation between imports and exports may vary. In the short run a fall in imports, unaccompanied by a corresponding fall in exports, will serve to strengthen a country&apos;s exchange position. In the long run. it will serve to increase its margin for investment abroad, or to diminish its necessity to borrow abroad. It is, of course, essential that this increased margin should in fact be utilised for investment, and not allowed to accumulate in the form of gold or liquid balances abroad. Otherwise the maintenance of the level of exports would necessarily in time be endangered. In Great Britain we have seen the net annual rate of overseas investment vary within a generation from a figure of nearly  200 millions to a minus quantity. The range within which the relation between imports and exports can be altered is correspondingly large. We must, at the same time, also bear in mind that to an important extent overseas lending directly stimulates the demand for our exports41. It follows that, in such circumstances as existed in Great Britain in 1931, when the balance of payments was adverse, and when there was a large volume of unemployment both of labour and capital equipment, there is no necessary reason why the increased employment obtained by absorbing unemployed resources in producing at home goods previously imported should be balanced by a corresponding loss of employment in the exporting industries. There is, we think, no doubt that the increase in employment in Great Britain since 1932 is largely attributable to the reduction of imports of manufactured goods, unaccom-panied by a corresponding reduction of exports, which is attributable in turn partly to the fall of the pound and partly to protective measures. It should be added that the possibility of achieving this result rested largely on the fact that we had previously been a free trade country, importing a large quantity of goods which we could make almost equally cheaply at home. When a country excludes such goods in normal times by means of tariffs, its ability to obtain relief in times of depression is greatly diminished, as protectionist countries have had reason to learn.42. Because, however, the relationship between imports and exports is not precise and rigid, it does not follow that measures taken to diminish imports are unlikely to affect exports at all. On the contrary, there are various ways in which protective measures tend to react adversely on exports; and the question whether this adverse effect is negligible, or important, depends on the circumstances of the particular case.43. In so far as the measures adopted reduce the value of our imports, the reduced international purchasing-power of the countries whose goods are excluded
is likely to react prejudicially on our exports in general. If the countries which are adversely affected are in a weaker financial and exchange position than ourselves, the broad effect upon world conditions will be deflationary, and the reaction on exports may be correspondingly severe. Accordingly, greater weight attaches to this consideration now than it did in 1931, when we ourselves were in an especially weak exchange position. Again, the adverse reaction on exports will be increased if the adoption by us of protective measures causes other countries to raise tariffs or impose other obstacles upon the entry of our goods. It will also be increased in so far as the countries whose goods are excluded are good customers for British exports. Serious account must be taken of the latter considerations, in particular, in the case of our imports of primary products from the British Dominions and South American states.44. We have indicated, in paragraphs 17 and 18 above, the serious difficulties which the revolutionary change in the population outlook creates for the countries, both within the Empire and outside, from whom our overseas supplies of food are mainly drawn. In most of these, the production of primary products, largely for export to the British market, is the dominating feature of their economic life. Most of them are new countries, with sparse populations, which have been accustomed to look forward to a rapid rate of development, and have equipped themselves with capital facilities and incurred financial obliga-tions, on a scale which only the expectation of a rapid rate of development could justify. They had tacitly assumed that this development would be based largely, as it has been hitherto, on a steady increase in the export of primary products to the British market; and the mere prospect that the British demand for primary products may cease to expand, let alone decline, which has been raised by the recent discussions of quantitative restrictions, has come to them accordingly as a disagreeable shock. To a large extent, of course, and as a long period matter, they have got to face this prospect as inevitable; for it has its roots not in British agricultural policy, but in our vital statistics. The role of supplier of food-stuffs to the industrial population of Great Britain no longer offers scope for unlimited expansion. The countries of the new world must adjust themselves to this inexorable fact, and they must pursue the development of new markets or seek another and more diversified basis for the continued development of their economic life.45. If, however, we were to pursue in Great Britain a long-term policy of deliberately reducing imports of food-stuffs in order to develop agriculture at home, this problem of adjustment would be seriously aggravated. In these circumstances there would be a natural disposition in the food-producing countries to attribute to British policy a larger share of responsibility for their difficulties than would properly attach to it. Many of the countries in question are British Dominions, which, as such, have a special claim on Great Britain for a reasonable degree of considerateness for their vital interests. They are most of them countries which have been developed largely with the aid of British capital, and which normally purchase from Great Britain a large proportion of their imports. And they are precisely the countries with which in recent years we have seen the best hope of developing our export trade by commercial negotiations.46. This consideration is reinforced when we pass to consider another way in which the reduction of imports may prejudice our export trade. The restrictions may serve to raise prices at home sufficiently to entail an increase in our costs of production, unless there is an off-setting reduction in the standard of living. So far as we can judge, the protection accorded to our manufacturing industries has not this effect in any material degree. But this danger is obviously greater if we endeavour by protective means to expand our home output of food-stuffs which enter largely into the cost of living, and which we are naturally less well fitted to produce.47. The praises of the system of an international division of labour may have been sung too loudly and too indiscriminately in the nineteenth century. But the development of our trade with the New World on the principle of obtaining our necessary food-stuffs and raw materials partly as interest on the investment of our surplus capital resources and partly in exchange for our industrial products constitutes the classic example of the mutual advantages of international speciali-
sation. To turn round now upon this whole development, and gratuitously to render functionless much of the organisation, equipment and personnel which is specialised overseas in primary production, with the corollary of rendering correspondingly functionless much of our industrial life which is specialised for export, to create or to aggravate a large-scale transfer problem for the new countries at the expense of creating or aggravating a similar transfer problem for ourselves, would run counter to the whole idea of a rational development of the world&apos;s economy. The process of accomplishing this switch over would entail, both overseas and at home, a prolonged period of economic malaise, for every transfer problem of this sort operates as a generally depressing influence. It would, moreover, operate powerfully to destroy the intimacy and harmony of our relations with the overseas countries, and would be fraught with potentialities of the utmost gravity to the solidarity of the British Empire.48. For these reasons, we conclude that a long-term policy designed to effect a progressive reduction of important food imports in the interests of British agriculture would be likely to cause a more than commensurate injury through its adverse reaction on other branches of British industry and on the standard of life.5. Employment and   agriculture.49. We are now in a position to come more closely to grips with the chief issues of commercial and agricultural policy. We have already indicated our view that in the particular circumstances of recent years the protection accorded to British manufactures has served, in conjunction with the fall of the pound, to increase the volume of employment at home. But the possibilities of increasing employment by this means are now, in our judgment, speaking broadly, exhausted. We append to this report a table (appendix 2) which shows how drastically our principal imports of mainly manufactured goods have already been cut down. The following table represents an attempt to calculate for recent years the volume of employment (in terms of the number of workpeople) represented by our total home production and our production for export, and also the additional volume of employment which might be secured if the mainly manufactured goods at present imported could be manufactured at home without adverse repercussions : Table 4.Employment in manufacture and mining in the United Kingdom.*Year.	Estimated number of workpeople employed  In production   I   In production as a whole.           for export.		Potential volume of employment repre-sented by imports.1929   ...	5,871,000	1,659,000	573,0001930   ...	5,408,000	1,325,000	550,0001931   ...	4,825,000	1,001,000	550,0001982   ...	4,7S8,000	1,028,000	312,0001933    .......	5,050,000	1,040,000	315,00050. This calculation is necessarily subject to a large margin of error; but it represents, we believe, the correct order of magnitude. On this basis the direct increase in the volume of employment that would result if we could secure that all the mainly manufactured goods which we still import were produced at home, without any adverse repercussion upon other interests, could not amount to more than about 300,000 workers. When we take account of the substantial measure of protection which our industries now enjoy, the strong consequent presumption* Persons employed in the manufacture of food, drink and tobacco are excluded from the table. The goods included for the purpose of calculating employment in foreign trade are those covered by the following classes in the Board of Trade classification: For exports, Group II (classes A to D) and the whole of Group III; for imports, Group II (classes B and C) and the whole of Group III.
that the manufactured goods which we still import could not be produced easily or cheaply at home, and of the extent to which it is true that the finished product of one industry is the raw material of another, it seems improbable that any further material gain to employment, and not unlikely that serious indirect loss, would result from an extension of industrial protection. Indeed, it is not unlikely that the degree of protection which is already afforded to many industries, while stimulating in its immediate effects, and perhaps necessary during a slump, may entail counterbalancing disadvantages which will prove increasingly serious as time goes on. It is perhaps too soon to attempt to measure how far this is so; and we therefore do not enumerate them in detail, though some of them are touched upon above and in paragraph 38. But we set out in appendix 1 a list of some of the statistical criteria which should be available to anyone attempting to weigh from the short period point of view the advantages or disadvantages of protection in particular instances.51. There remains the question of agriculture. The argument of the preceding sections will have made sufficiently clear the reasons which lead us to formulate the following as the main principles which should guide our agricultural policy : (1) we should avoid measures calculated to raise materially the prices of essential foodstuffs to the British public above the level which would otherwise prevail or to entail a progressive reduction in the volume of our food imports;(2) we should contrive, however, in times of severe depression of world agricultural prices, to secure reasonable prices for our farmers, sufficient to maintain financial solvency and to avert exhaustion of capital, impairment of equipment or curtailment of production.52. The first of these principles, taken in conjunction with the impending decline in our population, obviously sets narrow limits to the extent to which we can hope to expand most forms of our home agricultural output. Indeed, in the case of many of the commodities which bulk most largely in our food imports, it would be, in our judgment, a mistaken policy to aim at an enlarged home production. For producing additional quantities of wheat Great Britain is at a natural disadvantage compared with the countries of the new world. For producing beet-sugar, again, Great Britain is at a disadvantage as compared with many continental countries, while beet-sugar is probably an uneconomic proposition relatively to cane. As regards both wheat and sugar, moreover, there is no tendency for imported supplies to deteriorate owing to transit and storage, and accordingly no advantage in respect of quality attaches to the home product.53. In our judgment, such efforts as we make to expand agricultural output, as distinct from securing a reasonable degree of stability of prices for our existing output, should be concentrated on those agricultural commodities which can be produced with advantage to quality in areas adjacent to large consuming-centres, or which we are otherwise especially well fitted to produce. These considerations apply to such commodities as fruit, milk, eggs, poultry and vegetables. These are also commodities of wdiich an enlarged consumption would be especially desirable, from the standpoint of improving the dietary, and. consequently, the physique of the population; it is largely to the stimulus of&quot; consumption that we must look to make a large output possible. But if the consumption of these commodities is to be stimulated, it is necessary that they should remain cheap. Again we should not lose sight in the case of agriculture of a general consideration which we stressed in connection with the exporting industries, namely, the importance of keeping in the van of new developments. Canning supplies an instance of a new development which is of great importance to agriculture for some products in some areas.54. But when allowance has been made for such possibilities, the enlarge-ment of agricultural output at which we can prudently aim remains very limited. It is, therefore, we fear, wholly illusory to suppose that agriculture can play the part which many would desire of supplying an opening for increased employment to compensate for the decline in the older exporting industries. Our experience in the last decade is pertinent in this connection. During this period, the numbers [10642] d
IS&apos; engaged in agriculture steadily declined,* although the volume of our agricultural output as a whole was fully maintained. Meanwhile, on the other hand, various other occupations showed a huge increase in the numbers of persons they employed; and the persistence of heavy unemployment in the chief exporting centres has perhaps served to blind us to the remarkable contribution which ordinary economic forces in fact made towards the solution of the transfer problem. The following table indicates what was accomplished between 1923 and 1933 :-Table 5.Estimated members of insured persons employed, in the United Kingdom.^(a) The principal industries which have expanded.Industry.

The figures for 1923 represents an estimate for these age groups, based upon the actual number of persons of 16 and over in that year, and the proportion which employed persons between 16 and 64 bore to employed persons of 16 and over in each industry in 1927.55. It will be observed that a large part of the increased employment of the past decade has been provided by the distributive trades, hotels and restaurants, and other services. It is natural that such a trend should arouse misgivings, since it is difficult to disabuse the mind of the instinctive impression that the more directly productive occupations have a superior dignity and usefulness, and even that a growth in the proportion of &apos; - non-producers &apos;&apos; betokens something parasitic and unsound.  As regards services generally, such apprehensions are, however, in* The number of persons recorded in the census as being engaged in agricultural occupations in Great Britain declined from 1,448,654 in 1921 to 1,352,967 in&apos;1931.

our judgment unfounded, though there are grounds for believing that there is much waste in the organisation of our distributive trades. Just as it is an inevitable feature of economic progress that a steadily diminishing proportion of the community should be engaged in the production of primary necessities like food, so, at the other end of the scale, it is inevitable that the proportion engaged in distribution, transport, and services should grow. Both tendencies represent the natural outcome of technical progress and a rising standard of life. It is to the further expansion of these occupations, together with the development of new and miscellaneous industrial occupations that we must continue to look for the solution of the transfer problem.56. We turn to consider the second main principle formulated in paragraph 51, that, namely, of securing a reasonable minimum of prices for our farmers amid the vicissitudes of world fluctuation. This is an object which we think it is vital to secure. If no special steps had been taken for the assistance of agriculture during the present crisis, the collapse of world prices would have entailed widespread bankruptcy among large sections of British farmers, which would have left behind it a lasting detrimental effect upon the efficiency and prosperity of our domestic agriculture. It is an object, moreover, which, for reasons developed earlier, we think may prove of recurring importance; it is one which our position as a large importer of foodstuffs should make it comparatively easy for us to secure; but the task of securing it in detail bristles with difficulties, and it is desirable that careful thought should be given to the question of the methods which it is best to employ.57. In the present crisis we have used, for a considerable number of commodities, the expedient of the quantitative limitation of imports. This expedient has been invoked partly to maintain prices, and partly to increase domestic production. From the standpoint of the British public, quantitative limitation is obviously an expensive method of securing the former purpose. For by this method the British consumers are required to pay higher prices not only for that part of the supply which is produced at home, but also for the part which is imported from abroad, although the public revenue derives no benefit as it does in the case of duties. In some degree, indeed, this has been the deliberate object of the use of the quota method. For it has been argued that it is in our interest, and in the interest of world recovery generally, to endeavour to maintain the purchasing power of primary producers overseas.58. The measure of force which can be attributed to this argument in the peculiar circumstances of the crisis of recent years is reduced in so far as the benefit of the higher prices has not accrued to producers overseas, but has been intercepted by intermediate trading interests. In any case, it is impossible, we think, to justify on such grounds the continued adoption of a method which is so paradoxical anl quixotic from the standpoint of British interests. The fact that we insist, as in effect we do under the quota system, on paying higher prices for foodstuffs we import than the producers overseas would be willing to accept is only of limited efficacy for raising the general world prices of these commodities. For part of the supply which would normally come to Great Britain may be diverted to other markets, including the home markets of the supplying countries. Thus the foodstuffs affected may become materially dearer for the British consumer, while they are becoming cheaper for consumers overseas. The continuance of such a policy would be in glaring conflict with the principles on which our position as a large exporting country with a high standard of life has been built up. Doubtless this policy has helped to mitigate the unpleasant consequences, to the countries which supply us with food-stuffs, of a curtailment in the volume of their trade. In general, however, it would be wiser, in our judgment, to pursue a policy which would reassure these countries against the progressive diminution in the volume of trade, and to pay more regard to our own national interests so far as prices are concerned.59. The possibility of assuring a reasonable price to the British farmer by methods which would be less burdensome to the British consumer is illustrated by the scheme that has been adopted in the case of wheat. By means of a com-paratively small levy upon imports, British farmers have been able to secure for their wheat a reasonable price, far in excess of the ruling world price. The [10642&quot;! d 2
burden on the consumers has been negligible and has served merely to withhold from them part of the windfall benefit which they would otheiwvise have derived from abnormally low prices. The burden on the overseas exporters has been comparatively small, because our imports of wheat bear such a high relation to our home production, and the policy has proved comparatively unobjectionable to them because it is not associated with the prospect of a rigid limitation on, still less a progressive curtailment of, the volume of their exports.60. The method of the wheat scheme would not, of course, be applicable to other commodities without considerable variations. Moreover, the method is open to the objection that it may lead to an undesired expansion of domestic output. The expansion in the production of wheat which has occun-ed is no doubt largely attributable to the substitution of wheat for other cereal crops which do not benefit from the subsidy. But there is obviously some danger that if the minimum price is originally fixed at too high a level having regard to the prices prevailing for other agricultural commodities, even a limitation of the maximum volume of production on which the subsidy is to be paid, such as is included in the wheat scheme, may not prevent a considerable increase in the production of the subsidised commodity. When an undesigned expansion of domestic output is thus brought about, the danger arises that the additional output will come to be regarded as part of our normal domestic production, with a claim to be preserved against overseas competition at the expense of the taxpayer and the consuming public. The admission of such a claim would be incompatible with the first of the two governing principles which we have formulated in paragraph 51. It is, therefore, important, in connection with any measures that may be taken to maintain prices for the British farmer, to devise suitable safeguards against an undesired increase in supply, but care must equally be taken to avoid conferring a monopoly on existing producers.61. The preceding paragraphs from paragraph 39 onwards have been primarily concerned with the effects of possible inci&apos;eases of restrictions of imports on the volume of our exports, since we understand that this is the question to which we were asked to direct our attention. We have not pursued in the same Avay the question of the effect on exports (a) of our future foreign exchange policy as affecting the future level of our domestic costs compared with costs abroad when expressed in a common unit, (b) of our future policy and inclinations towards foreign lending, (c) of the measure of recovery of world trade as a whole, and (d) of possible reductions of existing restrictions on imports both at home and abroad by means of negotiations. Lest, however, the particular aspect of the problem to which we have devoted our main attention should be seen out of its true perspective, we desire to add that the volume of our exports is likely to depend to a materially greater extent on the four other factors which we have mentioned than upon any future extension of restrictions on our imports, unless the latter were pushed to extremes.6. Summary of principal conclusions.62.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows : (1) The economic development of Great Britain in the Victorian age was based in a peculiar degree on overseas trade, the expansion of which was closely associated with overseas investment and emigration. The rapidity of her economic progress was largely attributable to the leading part which she played in the process of developing the new world with the capital, population and industrial products of the old (paragraphs 1-3).(2) The fall in birth rates which has gone so far as to render almost inevitable a substantial decline in the population of Great Britain and other Western countries, is likely in future to change fundamentally the conditions which constitute the background of international trade. The market which Great Britain provides for primary products from overseas cannot continue to expand steadily and rapidly as it used to do. Disturbances in world prices may be more serious and prolonged than they used to be, particularly in the case of primary commodities, when the strong upward trend of demand, arising from growing numbers, can no longer be relied upon to afford relief to a condition of overproduction (paragraphs 4-20).
(3) The outlook for British export trade is far from promising. It appears doubtful whether there will be any very speedy and substantial relaxation of the trade obstacles which have been set up during the present crisis, while the comparatively favourable competitive position which we enjoy at present in world markets may disappear (paragraphs 21-23).(4) The comparative success with which British economic life has adapted itself to the heavy loss of export trade which has occurred has given rise to a disposition to question whether the development of exports is so important or even so desirable as used to be assumed (paragraphs 24, 25).(5) It would, we believe, be bad policy to subordinate every other consideration to the pursuit of the goal of the maximum possible volume of export. Our essential interests can probably be adequately secured by a volume of exports materially smaller in relation to total production than we were accustomed to maintain in pre-war days (paragraphs 26-29).(6) But there are various reasons why we are convinced that the maintenance of a large-scale export trade is vital to our national prosperity. Large imports of food-stuffs and raw materials are essential to us, and we shall require in normal times a more favourable balance of payments than we have at present. Our economic life is still specialised in a large degree in occupations connected with export, for many of which we are peculiarly well fitted. Moreover, many of the industries which are most dependent on export are highly localised in character, so that to transfer their workpeople to other occupations represents a task of peculiar difficulty (paragraphs 30-33).(7) It would be a mistake to envisage the problem of the export trade exclusively in terms of the older staple types of exports. In all industries we should endeavour to keep in the van of new developments so as to obtain compen-*ation in fresh lines of trade for the old lines that we lose to low-wage competitors. Our progress in this respect in the twenties was perhaps somewhat disappointing (paragraphs 34-36).(8) It may be desirable to concentrate mainly on the promotion of our export trade in markets which are not likely to subject it to sudden and harassing disturbances. This supplies an argument in favour of cultivating friendly economic relations alike with the Dominions and with the Scandinavian and South American countries (paragraph 37).(9) It is essential to the maintenance of an adequate export trade that our costs should be such as to enable our industries to hold their own against the competition of other countries, though we cannot and should not attempt to improve our competitive position by lowering our standard of living (paragraph 38).(10) The relationship between a country&apos;s imports and its exports is not of so precise or rigid a kind that a given reduction in its imports must entail a precisely corresponding reduction in its exports, whether reckoned in volume or in value. But there are various ways in which protective measures tend to react adversely on exports; and the question whether this adverse effect is negligible or important depends on the circumstances of the particular case (paragraphs 39, 40).(11) The countries, both within the Empire and outside, from whom our overseas supplies of food are mainly drawn, are already faced with a serious problem of adjustment as the result of the impending decline in the British population. If we were to pursue a long-term policy of reducing imports of food-stuffs in order to develop home agriculture, this problem of adjustment would be seriously aggravated; and there would be a disposition in the food-producing countries to attribute to British policy a larger share of responsibility for their difficulties than would properly attach to it. Moreover, restrictions on food imports might serve to raise prices at home sufficiently to entail a rise in the cost of production through a rise in the cost of living (paragraphs 41-47).(12) Eor these reasons, we conclude that a long-term policy designed to effect a progressive reduction of important food imports in the interests of British &quot;agriculture would be likely to cause a more than commensurate injury through its adverse reaction on other branches of British industry and on the standard of life (paragraph 48).(13) We are of opinion that in the particular circumstances of recent years the protection accorded to British manufacturers has served, in conjunction with the fall of the pound, to increase the volume of employment at
home. But the possibilities of increasing employment by this means are now. in our judgment, speaking broadly, exhausted. Indeed, it is not unlikely that the degree of protection which is already afforded to many industries, while stimulating in its immediate effects, may entail counterbalancing disadvantages which will prove increasingly serious as time goes on. It is perhaps too soon to attempt to measure how far this is so (paragraphs 49, 50).(14) We suggest the following as the main principles which should guide our agricultural policy : (a) we should avoid measm*es calculated to raise materially the prices of essential foodstuffs to the British public above the level which would otherwise prevail, or to entail a progressive reduction in the volume of our food imports;(b) we should contrive, however, in times of severe depression of worldagricultural prices, to secure reasonable prices for our farmers, sufficient to maintain financial solvency and to avert exhaustion of capital, impairment of equipment or curtailment of production (paragraph 51).(15) The first of these principles, taken in conjunction with the impending decline in our population, obviously sets narrow limits to the extent to which we , can hope to expand most forms of our home agricultural output. In our judgment, such efforts as we make to expand agricultural output, as distinct from securing a reasonable degree of stability of prices for our existing output, should be concentrated on such commodities as fruit, milk, eggs, poultry and vegetables, which can be produced with advantage to quality in areas adjacent to large consuming centres, or which we are otherwise especially well-fitted to produce (paragraphs 52-55).(16) As regards the second principle, we have relied largely during the present crisis on the expedient of the quantitative limitation of imports. This is an expensive method from the standpoint of the public. The possibility of a less expensive method is indicated by the wheat scheme, though the method there employed would not be applicable to other commodities without considerable variations (paragraphs 56-59).(17) It is desirable that careful thought should be given to the question how the principle of maintaining a reasonable minimum of prices for British farmers can best be applied. In connection with any measures taken for the purpose, it will be important to devise suitable safeguards against an undesirable increase in supply, but care must equally be taken to avoid conferring a monopoly on existing producers (paragraph 60).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.

APPENDIX 1.Statistical criteria of the short period advantages of protection for particular industries.In the event of an inquiry being undertaken into the desirability of affording any particular industry increased pi-otection against the competition of foreign imports, the desirability of such protection may be gauged to some extent by the examination of certain statistical criteria. These criteria are necessarily only valid in determining the short period advantages of the proposed protection. The long period considerations are not susceptible of statistical determination. We assume, however, that due regard will be paid to them when short period remedies are under discussion. The following list indicates the field in which statistical investigation may be usefully pursued :  (A) Productive capacity of the industry.(I) The extent to which plant of good technical quality is at the moment out of use, and the level of unemployment compared with what has been, and may be expected to be again, the normal in that industry and the general level throughout industry clS ct whole.(2) Changes in the above factors compared with changes in the average level of unused capacity and unemployment in industry as a whole measured against an appropriate base or normal year.(3) The influence which existing restrictions have exercised (a) in increasing production at home, and (b) in diminishing total supplies abroad.(B) Prices.(4) The price of the product to the home consumer compared with the price of the same product to the consumer abroad.(5) Changes in the relation of these prices since a given date.(6) Changes in the price of the commodity at home compared with changes in the general price level at home since a given date.(7) Changes in the price of the commodity abroad compared with changes in the general price level abroad since a given date.(8) The effect on the cost of living index of changes in the cost of the commodity.(C) Profits, wages and output.(9) The rate of profit earned in the industry compared with that earned in industry as a whole.(10) The level of wages in the industry compared with the general level of wages.(II) Changes in the level of wages in the industry compared with changes in the general level of wages since a given date.(12) The net output per head in the industry compared with that in industry as a whole.(D) Effects of restrictions imposed by the United Kingdom on other countries and other trades.(13) The effect of existing or proposed restrictions on the part of the United Kingdom on the total output and exports of the countries from which supplies are imported.(14) The extent to which the market for British exports is likely to be curtailed by the factors enumerated in (13) above, and the type of British exports likely to be most affected.(15) An examination of the particular industries most affected under (14) above along the lines indicated in Sections (A), (B) and (C) above.
