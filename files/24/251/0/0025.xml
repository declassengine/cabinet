tS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).-jVR E T. p. 250 (54).C A B I n   jr.CIVIL SERVICE STTPERA.NNUATION BILL. Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Among the Bills which have been placed in the category of important Bills to be introduced next Session if time permits is one relating to Civil Service Superaimuation.      I now ask for the approval of the Cabinet in principle to the preparation of the Bill with a view to its consideration by the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet and to its introduction as and when circumstances may permit.     My hope is that the Bill will be non-contentious.It is unnecessary to trouble my colleagues with a detailed account of the proposed measure at the present stage, and I therefore limit myself to a brief outline of its ambit.The Royal Commission on the Civil Service male one primary recommendation on the subject of Superannuation, suggesting that for all new entrants to the Civil Service the system should be made contributory.      This suggestion, however, has been found upon examination to be neither reasonably practicable nor advantageous to the State nor acceptable to the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council.,      I do not propose to take any steps in that matter.The Bill will provide for a number of amendments, of varying individual importance, to the existing law governing superannuation, these amendments being &quot;based, broadly speaking on particular recommendations of the Royal Commission and. agreed., with minor exceptions, by the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council.    An amendmentCOPY NO.3t,
of general interest is that providing for the voluntary allocation, on an actuarial basis, by a retiring Civil Servant of part of his pension for the benefit of a dependant.The Ball will also ratify certain interpretations of existing law which have been followed in the award of pensions granted since the time of the emergency abatements of salary introduced in October 1931.      The proper interpretation of the law in its relation to those exceptional abatements is a matter of much difficulty, and the Public Accounts Committee have for some time past pressed very strongly, and with justice, for further legislation to place the legal position beyond doubt.Effect will also be given to the arrangements for the consolidation of existing Civil Service pensions announced in Cmd. 4665 of 1934.The proposals of the Bill will not involve any material increase in the existing expenditure on Civil Service Superannuation.(Intld.)    JT.O.reasury Chambers.8th November, 1934.
