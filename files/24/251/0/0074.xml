SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, DECEMBER  1934.Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.1. SINCE the date of our last report sterling has shown a depreciation in relation both to gold currencies and the dollar. The average rate of the dollar for the month of October fell to 4-940, the lowest monthly average since October of 1933. Although the general trend of sterling appears to be steadily downward, there have, in recent weeks, been considerable fluctuations in its value, depending on the changes in speculative sentiment. The following table (table 1) gives the average monthly rates of exchange since the beginning of the year 1933.Table 1.Average of mean daily rates of exchange in 1933 and 1934.New York.

It will be observed that at the beginning of October there was a fairly sharp decline in the value of sterling in relation both to the franc and to the dollar, a decline which was reversed from the middle of October onwards. When sterling was comparatively low, the dollar exchange roughly coincided with the parity indicated by the London and New York gold prices, but before the decline the London price of gold was above the price based on the New York parity.
Since the middle of October the London gold price has been below the price based on the New York parity, though it has recently been slightly above the price based on the Paris parity. A contributory factor in the weakness of sterling may have been the absence of large shipments of gold from India and South Africa; for although since the beginning of September there has been a continuous surplus of imports of gold over their exports, the imports from South Africa and India, as is shown in table 3, have been very irregular.Table 3.Gold imports into, and exports from, the United Kingdom since thebeginning of September 1934._______( 000&apos;s omitted.)_______Week ended 	Imports.

A factor which may prove to be of increasing importance in the exchange market has been the development of what is in effect a forward market in gold. Not only is the forward price of gold now being regularly quoted by certain London brokers, but in France a market in what are called gold options has sprung up. The main significance of this development is that it facilitates very greatly speculation for a rise in the price of gold by persons who have neither the funds nor the facilities for buying and hoarding gold themselves. It will thus increase the influence of changes in popular sentiment on the rates of exchange.4. The gold holding of the Bank of France continued to increase steadily up to the end of October, though more recently the bank has been in danger of losing gold in spite of supporting purchases of francs by the American exchange account. The Bank of Italy&apos;s gold holdings continue to decrease steadily and the margin between the minimum holding required by law having regard to the existing note circulation and the actual holding has been reduced to uncomfortably small proportions. The Reichsbank holding of gold has shown a small increase, but still remains negligible. The following table gives the gold holding of these three banks at the end of each month since June of this year : Table 4.Gold holdings of certain central banks. (000,000&apos;s omitted.)Date.

5. An event of great significance in the London money market has been the collapse, as a consequence of the growing difficulties which the banks have experienced in securing adequate quantities of bills, of the agreement hitherto existing between four of the principal clearing banks to maintain their rates for the discounting of bills at a minimum figure. As a result, the discount rate has fallen appreciably, Treasury bills having been placed at one time at less than 5s. per cent., though the rate last week rose to 6s. 4:d. per cent. The discount houses have been able to secure from the clearing banks a reduction in the rate charged on short-term loans secured on bills from 1 per cent, to ^ per cent.; but the rate charged on short-term loans secured on government stocks remains at 1 per cent. The consequence of this large reduction in short-term interest rates has been the diversion of funds on a large scale into the longer termed issues, with the result that the prices of government securities have advanced considerably. For example, the price of 2-g- per cent. Consols, which averaged 81 in September, rose to over 90 in November. This rise in the values of government stocks has affected the prices of ordinary shares. The London and Cambridge Economic Service index of security prices has shown the following changes since the end of June : Table 5.London prices of stocks and shares from the end of June 1934.

The price of silver has risen substantially since the beginning of July as a consequence of purchases by the United States Treasury in accordance with the terms of the Silver Act. Up to the middle of October, the rise in the price of silver was reflected in the rise of the value of the Chinese dollar, but on the 15th October, the Chinese Government announced an export duty on silver amounting to 10 per cent, plus a percentage sufficient to equalise the discount at which the Chinese dollar may stand from time to time in relation to silver. The price of silver and the price of the Chinese dollar are given in the following table : Table 6.The price of silver and the price of the Chinese dollar from June 1934.Date.

Employment among insured workers in Great Britain has, on the whole, followed the normal seasonal trend at this time of the year.7.   Commodity prices in the principal countries have shown the following movements since the beginning of 1933 :

The numbers recorded as unemployed were 2,056,000 in October this year as compared with 2,271,000 for October in 1933. The year 1934 has seen a slight increase in the number of juveniles seeking employment. This increase will be much more marked in the next three years, when the full effect will be felt of the high birth rates immediately after the war.9. The Board of Trade index of the volume of industrial production stands at 105-3 for the third quarter for the year compared with 109-7 for the second quarter and 109-5 in the first quarter. Compared, however, with the corre-sponding quarter of 1933 the index shows an advance of 8-8 per cent, in the third compared with 13-4 per cent, in the second quarter. This index normally shows a seasonal decline between the second and third quarters of the year.10. Building plans approved by local authorities for October 1934 showed an increase of 20-7 per cent, in comparison with October 1933. Building plans approved had shown in September a decline over 1933 of 5-3 per cent., in August an increase of 9-9 per cent, and in July an increase of 13-6 per cent. In the third quarter of the year there was an increase of 5-7 per cent, over 1933, in the first and second quarters of the year increases of 20 per cent. Plans passed for buildings for industrial purposes showed a considerable expansion in the third quarter in comparison with the previous year; but there was a slight decline in the plans passed for residential buildings. The recession in September appears to have been of no permanent significance.11. The output of steel in Great Britain amounted to 812-0 thousand tons in October, and to 734-7 thousand tons in September of this year compared with 668 - 3 thousand tons in October and 669 - 0 thousand tons in September of last year. &apos; The October output is the highest total since March of this year, when the output was 834-5 thousand tons. The output in the third quarter of the year, however, averaged 713-3 thousand tons compared with 751-4 thousand tons in the second quarter of this year and 595-9 thousand tons in the third quarter of 1933.
12. Retail trade has been, on the whole, very satisfactory in recent months, the increase in comparison with the corresponding months in 1933 being 3-1 per cent, in July, 4-8 per cent, in August and 4-1 per cent, in September. The following table (table 10) gives the average daily value of retail sales for each month since the beginning of 1932.Table 10.Yalue of average daily retail sales in Great Britain reported to the Bank of England since 1932.(Average for the year 1933=100.)Month.	1932.	1933.	1934.January	104	97	101February	91	88	91March	97	94	99April	104	104	101May ...	105	100	108June ...	100	101	103July ...	100	99	102August	86	86	90September	94	93	97October	101	102	105November	101	104	December	126	131	Year	101	100	13. Business activity in America showed a substantial decline between May of this year and September, a decline which was in part attributable to the rather heavy accumulation of stocks which took place during the revival last spring, in part to a falling off in the rate of government expenditure. The Federal Reserve Board index of industrial production has shown the following movements since the beginning of 1933.Table 11.Industrial production in the United States.

14. Although the level of production appears to have shown a substantial decline this has not been fully reflected in the reports of retail trade. The Federal Reserve Board index of department store sales (adjusted for seasonal movements) has been as follows : April.........      77 August ......      79May    .........      77 September      ...       ...      75June    .........      74 October ......      75July    .........      7215. A factor which is held to have considerable influence over the level of American business activity is the rate of emergency expenditure undertaken by the United States Treasury. In the following table we attempt to estimate the rate of this expenditure since July 1933. These figures do not include receipts and expenditure of the Treasury on account of the normal budget. For the purposes of this calculation, the emergency expenditure is defined as follows : (i) direct expenditure by government agencies;(ii) one-half of the refinancing expenditure by government agencies;(iii) subsidies paid to farmers by the Agricultural Adjustment Administra-tion less the receipts by that body on account of processing taxes.Half only of the refinancing expenditure is taken, as this expenditure cannot be expected to have such a direct influence on expenditure by the public as other forms of government expenditure.Table 13.Emergency expenditure in the United- States since July 1933.1933-J ulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberDate.Total monthly disbursementsThree months&apos; moving average.(Million dollars.)92 105&apos; 107 155 212325-9101-8 123-0 158-5 231-31934-JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovember568-7 372-8 363 0 309-7 259 - 9 335-5 314-0 285-0 308-0 327-0 371-0368-9 422-4 434-8 348-5 310-9 302 0 309-0 311 0 302-0 307-0 335 - 016. The upward movement of prices in America appears to have received some check. In the following table (table 14) we give indices of wage rates, of wholesale and retail prices and of the value of the pound sterling recalculated with March 1933 as base. It will be observed that, though there has been some further narrowing of the gap between the value of the pound sterling and that of the other indices, this margin still remains substantial and accounts for the comparatively disadvantageous position in which British industries have been placed by the depreciation of the dollar since March 1933.

Though the adverse balance of British trade continued to increase in the third quarter of 1934 in comparison with 1933, the increase was considerably less than in the earlier quarters. So far as the balance of payments is concerned, there may be some compensation in an improvement of our invisible receipts. By the end of the second quarter of 1934 the adverse balance of trade was 145 million pounds, an increase of 24 million pounds over the corresponding figure for 1933. By the end of the third quarter the adverse balance had increased to 210 million pounds, an increase of 28 millions in comparison with 1933. The percentage increases in the exports of British produce in comparison with the corresponding month of 1933 have been as follows : January ....... 8-2 June ...... 12-8February ...... 6-6 July ...... 10-9March ...... 1-5 August ...... 3-5April ...      ... 14 0 September ...      ... 5-2May ...... 6-5 October ...... 7-7The countries responsible for the principal increases and decreases in British exports in the second and third quarters of 1934 in comparison with the corresponding quarters of 1933 were as follows : Table 22.Countries to which exports of United Kingdom goods have shown substantial-changes bettveen 1933 and 1934.(In  000&apos;s.)Second	quarter.

Part II. The present economic situation.26. The central question suggested by the progress of economic events in this country is still how far can British recovery be expected to continue in the face of an international entanglement of growing complexity. It cannot yet be said that the momentum acquired since the beginning of 1933 has been entirely lost. The reports of trade activity still continue to show an encouraging propor-tion of favourable features, though it is no longer true, as it was when the upward movement was at its strongest, that almost every phase of economic life is making sustained and unmistakable progress. On the other hand, the serious consequences of the anomalous exchange rates brought about by the American devaluation are day by clay becoming more apparent. Nor has anything occurred which can be expected to modify substantially the sense of strain which has followed that event. In addition to these external obstacles to further improve-ment, the outlook at home is less promising than formerly, merely because the expansion of economic activity in certain branches has already been carried so far that in them there is little scope for further advance.27. The fluctuations which have occurred in the value of sterling in relation to the gold bloc currencies are symptomatic of the prevailing uncertainty. For they have arisen not so much from any alteration in the underlying economic realities though the weakness of the commercial demand for sterling has certainly been a factor of some importance as from rapid oscillations in the degree to which certain political decisions were held to be imminent. At one time it was believed that President Roosevelt would again attempt to stimulate American economic activity by a further devaluation of the dollar, and as it was expected that in this event sterling would follow the dollar, there occurred a considerable speculative movement against sterling and in favour of the gold bloc currencies. Subsequently, attention was focussed on the precarious nature of the political truce in France, and the probability that the gold bloc countries might, after all, be forced to suspend the gold standard seemed great enough to bring about a reversal of this movement. Thus for the present the exchange values of the principal currencies are supported in a position of unstable equilibrium by the adherence of governments to policies which may at any moment be reversed, and which therefore forms a matter for speculation.28. As we have already observed, the instability of the present exchange position arises from the undervaluation of the dollar in terms of the franc. The pound is, indeed, incorrectly valued in relation to both these currencies. It is too dear in dollars and too cheap in francs. But the divergence of sterling from its natural level compared with these two currencies is entirely the consequence of the inappropriate relation existing between them. In certain markets our trade is prevented from expanding by the competition of American exporters who enjoy the advantages of an undervalued currency, though the trade agreements we have made with countries in the sterling area have done something to soften the impact of American competition. In other markets we are receiving a compensating advantage at the expense of exporters in the gold bloc countries. In this way the commercial demand for sterling is mainained at a level which enables us to meet the cost of our increasing imports. But no action on our part can resolve the conflict of interest between the gold bloc countries on the one hand, and the United States on the other. Ultimately there are only two roads of escape from the existing impasse: either the relative level of costs in the United States and the gold bloc countries must be altered to the advantage of the latter, which in practice is equivalent to a further rise in American costs; or the present exchange levels must be abandoned, which in practice is equivalent to a devaluation of the gold currencies. But though a stable equilibrium may be reached along either of these routes, the immediate prospects of international trade are by no means the same in both cases. If American prices show a definite tendency to rise, we may expect a concurrent gradual improvement in the position of the gold bloc countries. In default of this, we must anticipate a continuation of the present deflationary conditions in those countries, until the pressure of&quot; circumstances makes a sudden change of policy inevitable, with reactions which, &quot;however favourable they may be in the countries concerned, will not be without their dangers for the rest of the world.
IS29. The course of recovery in America and the difficulties of the gold bloc countries, though no doubt the most important, are not the only factors which are exercising an influence on the course of world trade. Events in Germany, however closely related to those in other European countries, require separate discussion. And it will also be necessary to consider the prospects of revival in the volume of trade among the countries within the sterling area, independently of any marked improvement in the rest of the world.(a) Prospects in the United States.30. Our last survey of the economic situation-was written as the improve-ment in the American situation, which first became noticeable at the end of last year, had just given way to the reaction which seems to have reached its deepest point this September, at the time of the textile strike. As we anticipated, the present indications are that there will now be some recovery, which may be expected to persist at least till the end of the year. It is, perhaps, possible to attribute too great significance to these comparatively short fluctuations in the level of American business activity. During the three years which succeeded the collapse of the speculative boom of 1929 the trend of business was consistently downwards, but this decline was several times interrupted by short-lived and premature revivals. The alternations of recovery and reaction which have so far marked President E-oosevelfs period of office have, indeed, been of far greater violence, but there is little reason to place them in an altogether different category. These fluctuations seem to arise, first, from variations in government expenditure upon relief and upon public works and in government policy generally; secondly, from the almost unanimous reversals of speculative sentiment that occur in a business community which is subject in an exceptional degree to waves of mass emotion and attaches undue importance to a few over-simplified &apos;&apos; business indicators &apos;&apos;; and, finally, from the ease with which a temporarily favourable set of circumstances may, when productive capacity is greatly in excess of demand, be exploited to anticipate future demand. We may therefore address ourselves to a rather longer view of American events.31. From this aspect American industry generally appears to have consolidated a large part of the gains made in the summer of 1933; but different groups of occupations have not experienced the same fortune. The position of the industries which cater for consumers&apos; demand is relatively satisfactory, as they have benefited considerably from the huge expenditure of government funds. Agricultural output has been reduced, both by the policy of the administration and by this years drought. But the incomes of agriculturists have been consider-ably increased. On the other hand, the production of plant and machinery and the construction of new buildings, both residential and commercial, are on a very much diminished scale in comparison with the prosperous years preceding the slump. There has, indeed, been a substantial improvement in these industries, if comparison is made with the trough of the depression. But their surpluses of labour and plant are still enormous and form in America a &quot;hard core of unemployment&apos;&apos; similar to that which in this country we have come to associate with the industries dependent on foreign trade.32. In some respects the comparative depression of the mechanical and constructional industries is a phenomenon peculiar to the deflationary phase through which American industry has passed. But in spite of the considerably improved outlook, American business enterprises still show no willingness to undertake programmes of plant renewal on the lavish scale which characterised the period of prosperity. The reasons for their reluctance are complicated. Many of the larger concerns appear to have achieved a position of great liquidity; for throughout the depression they abstained from investing in new plant the large allocations which they normally make to depreciation. To some extent, indeed, the liquid resources, which this policy should have secured, were dissipated as a result of the huge losses incurred in the depression; but these concerns have emerged from this with reserves much more than adequate for their normal needs. The uncertainty of the general outlook, however, and the comparatively unsatisfactory return which can be earned by new plant still deter them from investing these resources in productive equipment.  On the other hand,
the small businesses which in the aggregate account for a substantial part of American production, are probably not nearly so well placed. In their case it is not unlikely that an actual shortage of liquid assets is a real deterrent from entering on a programme of plant renewals. And the weak selling of these comparatively illiquid concerns may even account, in part at least, for the unwillingness of larger businesses to adopt a more expansive policy.33. But an even greater obstacle in the way of absorbing the surplus plant and labour force attached to the constructional industries, lies in the fact that the distribution of resources between these industries on the one hand and occupations directly dependent on the demand for consumable goods and services on the other, was seriously out of balance in the years preceding the slump. Construction and new investment were then taking place on a scale which there was no reasonable prospect of maintaining, and the proportion of current income which was devoted to current consumption was correspondingly curtailed. Thus even if consumption should again reach its pre-depression levels there would still remain a large section of American industry which would be unable to find profitable employment; and this level of consumption will hardly be reached so long as a large section of the population remains unemployed.34. The natural remedy, both for the immediate problem of the lack of enterprise on the part of industrial concerns, and for the more enduring difficulties arising from the mal-distribution of resources between investment uses and consumption uses, is a substantial fall in the long-term rate of interest, with its corollary of a substantial rise in the valuation placed upon existing industrial assets. On the one hand, this should encourage business men to take a more optimistic view of their immediate prospects; on the other hand, it might be expected to act as a direct stimulus to expenditure and a deterrent to saving on the part of the public. Hitherto, however, the progress which has been made in this respect has been very disappointing. It has, indeed, been possible by the lavish creation of bank credit to reduce short-term rates of interest to very low levels : but long-term rates remain obstinately unaffected. It is impossible not to attribute this result to the financial heterodoxy which was for a long time a feature of the administration&apos;s policy. Financial sentiment was disturbed by the cumulative effect of the depreciation of the dollar, by the gold-buying policy of last autumn, by the immense budget deficits (both real and apparent), and above all by the apparent hostility to established business interest which the administration has displayed from time to time. One of the most encouraging developments of recent weeks has been the better understanding which has been reached between the administration and the bankers since the Presidents address to the bankers&apos; convention. It remains to be seen whether, in the event, this under-standing will bear substantial fruit in the financial field.35. For from the point of view of the average American investor the administration^ present policy may appear to have introduced a grave element of uncertainty into the sphere of investment. Consumers&apos; demand is being-supported by large scale expenditure on relief and public works, and by main-taining general confidence in the structure of internal indebtedness through the extension of the government&apos;s guarantee to the obligations of individuals. As a consequence, profits are now being made by a number of industries which were previously being operated at a loss. But at the same time fears have arisen lest the constant requirements of government borrowing may not in time react prejudicially on the bond market. Thus the owner of bonds to-day feels himself exposed to danger on both flanks; if the government emergency expenditure is curtailed, industrial profits will suffer and the danger of default may again become serious; if the government expenditure is continued the prospects of the bond market are not looked upon with favour. It is, of course, highly probable that the administration will succeed both in main-taining industrial profits and in securing some fall in the rates of interest. But at present the ordinary investor is showing a disposition to await events, and in the meantime to hold his resources in a comparatively liquid form. Thus the increase in liquid funds which the administration^ monetary policy has made available is prevented from exerting its normal influence upon the prices of securities.
36. In these circumstances great importance attaches to the development of the internal situation. President Roosevelt has shown recently a much greater willingness to conciliate financial opinion, and he may be expected to persevere in this course. Emergency expenditure will, indeed, continue even the more con-servative elements recognise that it is idle to look for a balanced budget in the immediate future but it is likely to be confined within limits which will not excite apprehension. Moreover, this expenditure is likely to be increasingly devoted to the promotion of an extended programme of house building which will meet a real economic need, and is therefore likely to put less strain upon public finances than expenditure upon the less immediately remunerative public works. On the other hand, there is small probability of any radical development in the field of monetary policy. The President seems to have no desire to renew the experiments in monetary manipulation which marked the first year of his term of office. Thus there are some grounds for hoping that the improvement which we anticipate in the American scene as a reaction from the recession which characterised the summer months will be, if not spectacular, at any rate based upon a more solid foundation of financial confidence, and more likely to accumulate momentum as it progresses. These expectations would be disappointed, however, if President Roosevelt were to succumb to the pressure of the left wing of the overwhelming majority recently secured by the Democratic Party at the congressional elections. Should events pursue a comparatively favourable course, this pressure is likely to be held in check by the Presidents personal authority; but if recovery is delayed, the demand for a return to the policy of experiment may prove to be irresistible.37. An improvement in the level of American business, however well sustained, is unlikely to afford sufficient relief to the international situation unless it is accompanied by a substantial rise in American prices. Rut we have no great confidence that this will occur. The history of recovery in this country is sufficient indication that a substantial increase can take place in the volume of production without a corresponding rise in the level of prices, as long as a large section of the productive resources of the country remains unemployed. The substantial rise in American prices and costs which has taken place since the abandonment of the old gold parity must very largely be attributed to special features of American policy such as the depreciation of the dollar, the wage and price raising provisions of the National Recovery Act, the agricultural policy of limitation of output and bounties to farmers, and the improved bargaining position of trade unions as long as they seemed to enjoy the favour of the administration. But these factors are no longer exerting the same - pressure towards a further rise of prices; the National Recovery Act in particular is now to be administered with rather different objectives from those with which it was originally framed. Thus, the change which we anticipate in the direction of government policy holds out the prospect of a period of comparatively stable prices, provided that the President is able to control the left wing&apos; of his supporters.(b) The gold bloc and Germany.38. The prospects of the gold bloc countries would be very different if they had not publicly attached such importance to the maintenance of a common front. For as things now stand, the franc, which is by far the strongest of the associated currencies, is exposed to all the risk of a speculative attack that would follow from the defection of any single member of the group. We have called attention in the first part of this report to the gradual development of a speculative market in gold. In-more normal circumstances this is a development which might assist the smooth working of a system of variable international gold parities. At the present moment, however, it increases the influence of changes in popular sentiment upon the fortune of the gold currencies and may work as a further unstabilising factor in a situation which is already sufficiently disturbed. In particular, it is likely to increase the probability that the defection of one member of the gold group will involve the defection of the remainder.39. Each member of the gold bloc is to-day experiencing the unpleasant consequences of an overvalued currency; but this fundamental disadvantage is
bearing with different weight upon the various elements of the economic life in each country, and the reactions of popular opinion are correspondingly diverse. Belgium, which because of its comparatively small size and its high degree of industrial and commercial development is peculiarly dependent on export markets, is very sensitive to the competition of countries which have the advantage of a depreciated currency. The first and obvious effect of overvaluation, the depression of the exporting industries, is in its case sufficiently important to create a profound dislocation of its economic system, and to provoke demands from industrial circles for devaluation as a remedy. Up to the present, however, the rentier element, which has already suffered the effects of a devaluation by six-sevenths, has been strong enough to prevent these demands being accepted by the government. In the case of Holland and Switzerland there are similar demands from industrial circles, and Holland has been affected by the export difficulties of the Netherlands East Indies, but the main difficulty is the burden of internal indebtedness. On the other hand, the rentier element is even stronger in those countries than in Belgium, and supports deflation as against devaluation. In Italy, on the other hand, the most significant result of the overvaluation of the lira has been serious pressure on the exchange. The Italian balance of trade, unlike that of other members of the gold bloc, is becoming steadily more adverse, and the resulting financial stringency is already threatening the policy of public works and assisted house building by which the government has attempted to mitigate the full effects of the depression. In these circumstances the authorities have had recourse to further measures of exchange control, to the restriction of imports by quotas, and to the possibilities of securing further foreign exchange by the negotiation of bilateral trading agreements. In France, finally, the effects of the overvaluation of the currency have become merged in a general deflationary process which is affecting internal demand simultaneously with the decline in foreign trade. Foreign exchange difficulties have played a small part in this movement. Thanks to the strict system of limitation of imports, the balance of trade is satisfactory; and the existing reserves of gold are more than adequate to meet any probable call upon them, short of a widespread internal distrust of the currency. But the financial difficulties of the government which are the immediate cause of the deflationary situation are themselves largely clue to the shrinkage in the volume of foreign trade, though they are now accentuated by the increasing depression to which they have given rise. In France, therefore, devaluation has a smaller measure of support than in the rest of the gold bloc; although, in view of the enormous gold holdings of the Bank of France, and the absence of other suitable assets in which it may invest, the process of devaluation would operate more effectively than any other remedy to reverse the present deflationary trend.40. Thus, the gravest threat to the maintenance of the gold standard in the gold bloc countries, arises from the growing demand for devaluation among important sections of the industrial community, particularly in Belgium and Holland. In neither of these countries is the maintenance of the gold standard the matter of national, as distinct from governmental, prestige which it is in France and Italy. In neither country are any palliative measures such, for example, as an agreement on the part of the French to support the belga or the florin, or an attempt to improve the balance of payments by the exclusion of imports likely to be effective in promoting any measure of internal recovery. As far as they are concerned, the choice lies between a whole-hearted reduction of internal costs, devaluation, or, in default of one of these remedies, a determination to endure a depression of their economic activity until world prices and trade improve enough to set them again on their feet.41. The defection of Belgium or Holland or of both might not necessarily entail a departure from the gold standard on the part of France. But the stability of the franc itself is precariously based on the maintenance of the present political regime in France. A serious political crisis may at any time be the signal for further intensive hoarding of gold; and a substantial drain of gold from the Bank of France for this purpose would create a general malaise, which only devaluation could remedy. In France, however, in contrast with the other gold countries, a substantial degree of internal recovery might be possible within
the limits set by the existing gold parties, if only some relief could be found from the existing financial tension. The very high rates of interest which rule to-day are said to be having a restrictive effect on new investment, which is certainly reflected in the depression of the building and engineering industries. But, failing a distinct improvement in public confidence, an improvement in the investment market is hardly to be looked for.42. Though the maintenance of the gold bloc is obviously dependent on political circumstance, and though the adherence of some members, at least, to its code of self-denial can hardly be prolonged indefinitely, it would be rash to assume that its general disintegration is necessarily imminent. It may be remembered that public opinion in this country, even at a time when world trade was depressed, endured the consequences of an overvalued currency without too great complaint; it was only when an enormous external drain of funds from London made the maintenance of the old gold standard impracticable that the pound fell. In the case of the gold bloc, the degree of overvaluation is greater; but there is not to-day any external threat to the stability of the group as a whole, though the position of Italy, if she stood by herself, would be somewhat precarious. A decision to devalue may. indeed be accelerated by external events, if these are of a kind to influence internal public opinion in that direction. In particular, a decision by the United States Government still further to devalue the dollar would exert an important influence; but in France at any rate the abandonment of the existing parity will not be forced upon a reluctant govern-ment by a drain of gold originating from abroad.43. The development of German policy has also reached a very critical phase. In 1933, when a halt was called to the process of internal deflation, the new government made the extension of employment the main objective of its economic policy, and its internal prestige depends to a very great extent on its success in this field. It was always obvious that one of the main obstacles in Germany&apos;s path would be an increasing shortage of foreign exchange; but, as the year 1932 had disclosed a substantial favourable balance of trade, and as the new government was prepared if necessary to consider a default in the payment of interest on external loans, it was not unreasonable to hope that this shortage would not impede the process of internal recovery. But this expectation has been falsified, largely as a consequence of the failure of German prices to conform to the movement of gold prices in the rest of the world. During the last eighteen months German prices have followed a very similar course to that of prices in America, where the rise in internal prices has been accompanied by a more than equivalent fall in the external value of the currency. Thus there has been a serious divergence between the internal and the external value of the German currency, and, in consequence an intensification of pressure on the exchange resources, which would in any event have been severe. German reserves of foreign exchange ai-e now for all practical purposes exhausted, and it has become necessary to limit the volume of imports to the amount which can be bought with the exchange currently available. In the face of these difficulties the German Government, though principally for reasons of internal policy, have embarked upon a programme of internal price control.44. The most noticeable feature of the German recovery over the last year has been a substantial rise in the level of domestic investment. We have already in the first part of this report (see paragraph 22 above) given statistics bearing upon this point. These statistics indeed indicate that the increase in investment which has taken place is in some degree dependent on direct government expenditure. Employment in road building, for example, has greatly expanded. But the Government is probably responsible for a much larger share &quot;of the total increase than these figures alone would suggest. Iron and steel consumption and the output of motor cars have no doubt been enhanced by purchases for military purposes. But, making all allowance for the expansion directly due to these factors, there has evidently also been a substantial revival of commercial demand for new plant and machinery. As in the other countries which have experienced the same improvement, the putting in hand of replacements neglected in the worst period of the depression appears to have contributed largely to this result.   The importance of this potential market for investment goods is well
illustrated by the following table, which we quote from the weekly report of the Institut fur Konjunkturforschung: Table 24.Sums set aside for depreciation and expended on replacements by industrial companies in Germany tcith over 1,000.000 R.M. of capital stock.(1,000 R.M.)Business year.	- Value of plant. i	Depreciation of plant.

At the same time expenditure on durable consumption goods, such as motor cars and furniture, was encouraged either by loan or by lighter taxation. Thus the government was able to bring about a very considerable expansion of investment by inducing businesses and individuals to undertake expenditure which they had been forced to postpone at the time when the depression was at its height. The improvement in the investment industries was accompanied, at any rate in its first stages, by considerably increased consumption, and a substantial replacement of depleted stocks of half-finished goods, though the latter tendency now appears to have been reversed.45. From the spring of this year increasingly severe restrictions have had to be applied to restrain imports within the limits set by the available foreign exchange. Among other measures which were found necessary was an organised system of short-time working in the textile industries; and other consumption industries appear also to have been affected. So far these measures have not brought about a substantial decline in the level of production; but they have contributed to raise internal prices, and they contain an implied threat to the measure of recovery in the investment industries on which German recovery has so far been based. For if production is checked by the shortage of raw materials, investment in productive machinery is also likely to decline. The maintenance of activity in the investment industries, therefore, is likely to become more difficult, and to call for increasing government assistance; though the projects which are now under consideration with the object of rendering German industry less dependent on imported raw materials will require heavy capital outlays. There are, however, some indications that the Government realises that may be necessary to resume the importation of such raw materials as, for example, wool.46. German recovery is thus intimately bound up with the possibility of maintaining a sufficient supply of raw materials by means of the intricate system of exchange and import control which has now been brought into existence. It is, indeed, arguable that the elaborate regulations which this system imposes upon the conduct of foreign trade, and the increasing interference with the conduct of private industry which follows in their train, receive inadequate compensation in the alleged advantages of maintaining the mark at its present gold parity. Furthermore, if greater employment is the principal objective of German policy it seems very perverse to neglect the opportunities of greater employment in the export trades which a devaluation of the mark would provide.
O -iThe German authorities, however, remain extremely apprehensive of the shock to internal confidence of any action which might seem, however remotely, to foreshadow a second collapse of the mark, and they also appear to be influenced by the advantage which as a debtor country they derive from maintaining the price of their exports in terms of the currencies in which their foreign obligations are expressed.47. The measures which have been adopted to secure adequate supplies of raw material can, in spite of their administrative complexity, be classed under five main headings. First, the available exchange is distributed among importers so as to secure the classes of imports most essential to German industry as a whole. Every import transaction receives the authorisation of one of the control offices, which must satisfy themselves that goods to be imported cannot be obtained in the home market, and must prevent the building up of unnecessary stocks of materials. Secondly, exports which would not otherwise take place are assisted by allowing the exporter to take part of the payment for his goods in one of the categories of blocked marks or scrip which stand at a considerable discount in terms of other currencies. By this device free exchange becomes available for imports to the extent to which the goods may not be paid for in scrip or blocked marks; and, to the extent to which payment is made in the latter forms, the foreign obligations which would otherwise be accumulating as a result of current defaults are disposed of at comparatively little cost. Thirdly, special barter transactions under which German goods are directly exchanged for foreign goods abroad are being actively encouraged. This class of transaction is obviously capable of considerable extension, as goods may be exchanged in this way which could never be exported with profit for cash in view of the over-valuation of the mark. Fourthly, the German Government is developing a system of bilateral trading agreements with a number of foreign countries with the object of bringing about a balanced trade between the two parties to the agreement. Till recently these agreements have been concluded only with countries with which Germany had a favourable balance of trade; but lately an attempt has been made to extend the principle to countries such as the Union of South Africa, and the Argentine, from which German)&apos; buys more than she sells. Finally, Germany is attempting to lessen her dependence on foreign imports by the extension of the use of home-produced raw materials. The most practical projects which have so far emerged are extensions of the use of artificial silk, of motor fuel produced from coal and lignite, and of home reserves of low-grade ores of minerals now imported.48. These measures will all no doubt prove effective up to a point either in extending the field of German exports or in reducing the volume of imports. But when we consider the grave disequilibrium between prices in Germany and the prices of her principal competitors, the rising tendency of raw material prices, and the largely increased volume of home consumption which it is hoped to support, it seems doubtful to us whether it would be possible entirely to safeguard German industry against the effects of a shortage of foreign exchange. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of the measures taken should prevent a setback in production in Germany degenerating into an industrial collapse.(c) Great Britain and the prospects of international trade.49. We next address ourselves to the possibilities of a revival of demand within the boundaries of the sterling area. The majority of countries which, form this group are specialised in the production of food stuffs and raw materials. Great Britain is the principal exception to this rule; and our peculiar duality of position as, on the one hand, an industrial and European nation, and, on the other, the financial capital of a numerous group of agricultural and mining communities, has been responsible for many of the outstanding events since the war. The two factors which are pre-eminently responsible for the prosperity of the sterling area are thus the demand for raw materials on the part of industrial countries on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the financial policy, which is pursued in London.
50. We have already discussed the probable course of demand in two of the main markets for primary products, the United States, and continental Europe. As far as the United States is concerned, there is some prospect of an improving level of industrial activity which should entail correspondingly greater imports of primary products. In continental Europe, however, there is small hope for a substantial improvement in the demand as long as the present gold parities are maintained. Nor is there any prospect that a revival in demand in Great Britain alone could compensate for the loss of markets on the continent, which the deflationary conditions there prevailing and the policy of extreme agrarian protection have already entailed. Thus, though the demand for primary products on the part of industrial countries is likely to expand rather than to contract in the next few months, it will hardly approach the level achieved before the depression until some solution has been found for the troubles of Europe.51. On the other hand, the expansive monetary conditions which have existed in Great Britain since 1932, have already had substantial and beneficial repercussions in other countries of the sterling area. In Australia, in South Africa, and in Sweden there has been an immense improvement in underlying financial conditions, which has already given rise to a large expansion of building activity, and is no doubt also reflected in other phases of economic life. Such developments as these not only add directly to the consuming power of the sterling area, but by affording alternative opportunities of employment in the countries exporting primary products, do something to relieve that pressure to export which in the earlier stages of the depression had such unfavourable reactions on the prices of these commodities. Although this movement has already made considerable headway, we do not believe that it has by any means reached its limits. There are considerable areas in which comparatively stringent financial conditions still prevail; and later in this report (paragraph 65 below) we revert to the steps which may be taken in this country to remedy this defect.52. Having regard to all these circumstances, in what light should the possibility of a devaluation of the gold currencies be looked upon in this country ? On the one hand, the competitive advantage enjoyed by a number of our exporting industries at the present time is a consideration which must necessarily incline us to view with concern a considerable cheapening in the costs of production of European industry. We must attach all the greater weight to this point of view because the industries which are benefiting from the overvaluation of the gold currencies are precisely those in which a surplus of capacity and personnel would be peculiarly difficult to absorb in other directions. On the other hand, the pound is being maintained at an artificially high level in terms of the dollar by the maintenance of the present franc dollar exchange rate, and this is having a repressive effect upon the industries subject to American competition, though for other reasons they are enjoying comparatively prosperous conditions. Finally, the deflationary conditions prevailing in Europe are prejudicing the prospects of recovery in the agricultural and raw material producing countries, a recovery which would be of great advantage to British exporters of industrial products and to British producers of agricultural goods. These opposing considerations are nicely balanced.53. If we could count on the devaluation of the gold currencies being kept within moderate dimensions, such as would be justified by the actual differences of price levels, and if, after devaluation, a radical change could be expected in the economic policies of the countries concerned, the ultimate advantages which would result from the greater freedom of exchanges and the greater demand from those countries, particularly for raw materials, would outweigh the temporary disadvantages which would be caused by the increased competitive power of the continental industries. But it would appear doubtful whether either of the above conditions, would be fulfilled and highly improbable that they would both be fulfilled. - The main safeguards against an excessive devaluation of the gold currencies are the apprehensions of a financial panic felt by the governments concerned, and the strongly expressed view of the rentier class, for example, in France, that, having lost four fingers in the previous devaluation of the franc, they should not now be asked to sacrifice their thumb in a further devaluation.   If,
however, the governments overcome their apprehensions sufficiently to devalue at all, they would almost certainly devalue sufficiently to give their countries some competitive advantage in international trade. It is conceivable, indeed, that the devaluation might be carried beyond the limits which we could afford to regard as reasonable.54. At the same time, the real apprehensions felt as to the risk of popular panic would probably lead them to maintain, and possibly even to intensify, controls of exchange and restrictions on imports. These latter restrictions have created powerful vested interests which would demand their retention. It would be argued that this was necessary in order to prevent a collapse of the exchange and the measures taken in this country to restrict imports in 1931 would be quoted as a precedent. There seems, therefore, no very good prospect of any considerable movement towards a more liberal economic policy resulting immediately from devaluation, though it would doubtless make for this in time.55. Meanwhile, we should, of course, not be idle spectators of events, and we might meet an excessive devaluation of the gold currencies by some further depreciation of sterling. But this might not be easy. The abandonment of gold by the continental countries might be the signal for a fresh influx of money to London and to New York for safety, which would tend to force sterling up as against the gold bloc currencies. Moreover, there are limits to what we could contemplate in the way of deliberate depreciation of sterling, as it would not be in our interests to provoke fresh demands in the United States for a further devaluation of the dollar. And if one or more of the gold bloc countries, instead of devaluing in terms of gold, were to link their currencies with sterling at what we regard as an inappropriate- level, it is difficult to see how we could effectively protect ourselves.56. Apart from currency measures, we might be driven to consider imposing exchange dumping duties to counteract the competition in our domestic market of the continental industries. This would no doubt be somewhat inconsistent with the strenuous and successful efforts which we have made to secure the abolition of similar duties imposed upon our goods since we went off gold on the ground that they constituted an infringement of the most favoured nation clause. But even if general anti-dumping duties could be avoided, our industries would have the right to put claims for increased protection before the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and in such cases as iron and steel, the pressure might be difficult to resist. Any such additional protection, however, would not help our exports to compete in neutral markets and would probably handicap them by increasing their costs. On the other hand, in so far as they were effective in protecting our market, they might force the continental currencies lower than would otherwise be necessary. .57. The United States would be faced with much the same problems as this country; and in addition they might find themselves called upon to absorb an immense influx of gold.  Much would depend on the action that they took.58. It would thus be an illusion to think that the devaluation of these currencies would at a stroke relieve the present difficulties of world trade. It seems far more likely that it would set in motion a fresh series of disturbances, and that a long period might elapse before equilibrium could be restored. Undoubtedly the best thing would be for the United States prices of commodities entering into international trade to rise sufficiently and quickly enough to enable the gold currencies to regain equilibrium before the strain becomes unbearable. But if this does not prove to be the case (and there seems little likelihood of Germany at any rate getting through), all we can do is to watch events and to use all our influence to keep devaluation, if and when it is decided upon, within reasonable limits and to secure that it is followed as soon as possible by more liberal policies both as regards exchange controls and trade barriers. In the conditions under which devaluation is likely to take place, it would be optimistic to expect that it could be based on international agreements; we have steadily refused to allow our sterling policy to be determined by the needs of other countries, and it is not likely that the more important continental countries
would allow their policy to be decided by reference to our requirements. But it is not impossible that we might be in a position to influence the policy of such countries as Germany and Belgium, which are by far the most important to us from the point of view of industrial competition. Before these countries take the plunge, they may well appeal to us for credits to strengthen their position in case of a domestic panic. Should this happen in the case of Germany, political as well as economic factors would doubtless have to be taken into account in view of the character of the present regime in that country, but from the purely economic standpoint it would be a matter for consideration whether or not we should help them, in collaboration with the United States. Apart from this, it would be wise for us to circumscribe the difficulties of international trade by not being in too great a hurry to counteract devaluation by additional protective duties. The economic fortunes of the world during the next few years will largely depend on the extent to which all the governments concerned can be induced to adopt moderate policies in their respective spheres.59. There is one further factor which inclines us to look with some anxiety on the continuance for any length of time of the existing exchange stringency in Europe. Hitherto the sterling group of countries have remained comparatively free from those artificial regulations of foreign trade which have played such an important and such a disastrous part in the commercial history of Europe since the exchange crisis in 1931. But as the difficulties of certain European countries in financing their imports of raw materials increase, they may attempt to extend the sphere of such negotiations to include primary products. Both in Italy and in Germany there is noticeable a disposition to make the purchase of raw materials contingent on the purchase of industrial goods from the importing countries. Should these efforts succeed, and should the gold currencies neverthe-less ultimately be devalued, the resulting improvement in the demand for primary products might not have any of the beneficial reactions on British exports which we should ordinarily anticipate. For the increased purchasing power that this would put in the hands of primary producers would already be earmarked for purchases from the devaluing countries and no share of it would accrue to Great Britain. It is therefore obviously to the interest of this country to preserve the sterling area from entanglements of this kind, a task which will become progressively more difficult if the present condition of stringency is prolonged.60. These considerations are of more than academic interest when related to the rather critical point which British recovery has now reached. The course of the depression which began in 1930 and of the subsequent recovery may be divided into three phases, the nature of which it is the object of table 25 to illustrate. The figures which follow are necessarily extremely conjectural and can only be expected to reflect the broad general tendencies of the forces at work. It is the purpose of the table to show how the demand for labour at different stages of the depression arose from different quarters. In the case of any single industry the demand for labour is the resultant of three different factors, the demand for the product of the industry in the home market, the extent to which this demand is satisfied by imports, and the demand for the export of the product from abroad. The table is concerned only with employment in the occupations covered by the unemployment insurance scheme. The analysis gives the total demand for labour (whether satisfied from home sources or by imported goods) arising from expenditure in the United Kingdom (column (d)), and this total home demand is further divided between demand arising from current consump-tion, whether of goods or services, on the one hand (column (c)), and demand for labour to maintain or add to the country&apos;s equipment of capital goods on the other hand (column (b)). The table then gives the extent to which the labour required to produce goods and services consumed in the United Kingdom was reduced as a result of imports from abroad (column (e)), and the labour directly employed in the production of goods exported from the United Kingdom (column (f)). Finally, in column (g), we give the difference between these two-quantities, namely, the demand for labour to produce exports, and the extent to which the home demand for labour is diminished by reason of imports. This difference represents the net effect of overseas trade on the demand for labour in the occupations considered; and we have called it, for want of a better name,, the &quot; net external demand for industrial labour.&quot;

The first phase of the depression lasted from the beginning of 1930 till the end of 1931. Though employment &quot;as a whole was declining rapidly, the net external demand for labour declined very much more than proportionately. The proportion of employment afforded by expenditure on investment goods at home was, however, maintained; a decline in the engineering group being offset by an increase in building, thanks to the expenditure on public works which was then taking place. During this period the numbers employed in supplying goods and services for the home market were comparatively well maintained, and the percentage of the whole engaged in these occupations consequently increased. The second phase, which began with the crisis of 1931, showed a complete reversal of these trends. Employment in investment declined, as the public works programme came to an end; but the net external demand for labour increased substantially, largely as the result of the exclusion of goods previously imported. In this phase there also occurred a small but significant decline in the numbers employed for home consumption.   In the final phase, the phase of recovery which
may be held to have begun with the definite establishment at the end of 1932 of a period of cheap long-term rates of interest, there was a marked revival in employment both in investment, particularly in the engineering branch, and in home consumption. These three phases thus coincide with the three distinct phases of government policy, first the attempt to find compensation for the decline in foreign trade by an expansionist policy at home; secondly, the period of internal economy and of pre-occupation with the difficulties of an enormous adverse balance of payments; and lastly, the period of restoration of financial confidence and of a vigorous policy of cheap money. Employment has now nearly regained the level of 1929, but the events of the past five years have substantially modified its distribution among different uses. Home investment accounts for practically the same percentage of total employment as before the slump; but of this percentage a rather greater share is now accounted for by building. Net employment in foreign trade has shown a very considerable decline. On the other hand, employment in occupations supplying goods and services for the home market lias shown an impressive expansion, particularly the occupations which afford direct services to the public. In other words, the absence of new foreign investment, and the more favourable terms on which we can now secure our essential imports of foodstuffs and raw materials have resulted in the unem-ployment of a large number of workers previously engaged in production for export. Employment has now been found for an equivalent number of workers in home trade; but whereas home investment has barely reached the level of 1929, home consumption has shown a large increase. The people of this country are to-day spending a larger proportion of their current income on current con-sumption, and are devoting a smaller proportion to new investment, whether at home or abroad.62. In circumstances of exceptional depression, such as we experienced in the years 1931 and 1932, it is not unnatural that people should expend on current consumption a greater share of the income which is currently produced. The emergency is recognised as being temporary, and people are unwilling to reduce their standard of living proportionately to the fall in their income. Moreover, businesses tend in such circumstances to neglect the replacement of obsolete plant and to pay out to their shareholders and employees a larger sum than they actually earn, or at least a larger proportion of their earnings than they distribute in normal times. But now that the worst point of the depression is past, these factors exert little influence. A substantial fall in the rates of interest, on the other hand, is likely to have a more permanent effect in causing the community as a whole to spend a larger proportion of its income on current consumption. But a permanent tendency to spend more freely in circumstances of comparative prosperity can only be maintained if there is a fundamental change in the rates of interest. The conversion operation of 1932, and the gradual appreciation of government securities which subsequently took place, more than any other single event, have made possible the improvement in employment since the beginning of 1933.63. The gradual slowing down of the rate of improvement suggests, however, that the beneficial effects of that change are gradually working themselves out. The output of producers&apos; goods has now regained a level at which it probably fully supplies the current requirements of industry; the activity in building is probably at least as great as can be sustained over a long-period, indeed an active government programme may be required to maintain this activity at or near its present level. The expansion of home demand for consumers&apos; goods can only proceed slowly; and further substantial improvement is becoming increasingly dependent on employment in the sphere of foreign trade. But, although employment has now reached once more the level of 1929, the increase of at least a million persons has occurred since that date in the numbers of the employable population; and a further very considerable advance is necessary before we can be held to have achieved a tolerable degree of activity.64. The rise which has recently taken place in the prices of government securities is already affecting the level of industrial securities generally : and this will, no doubt, give rise to some further improvement in the industrial position; but it must be borne in mind that in part this improvement in the prices of home securities is the reflection of the difficulties which still stand in
the way of would-be foreign borrowers in the English market. Foreign issues are now permitted in the case of countries who wish to increase their sterling assets, or who are prepared to expend the whole of the proceeds of the loan on the produce of British industry. These exceptions, however, do not remove the embargo on loans of the kind which were most familiar in the London market before the slump, and the number of issues which have taken place since the relaxation of the embargo has been insignificant. We have already suggested that a further improvement in the financial status of the governments of countries within the sterling group is one of the conditions of any substantial revival of trade within that group. It is our view, therefore, that the embargo, at any rate in so far as it affects the sterling area., should be relaxed sooner rather than later. This would help to ensure that any further advance in the price of government securities would be soundly based.65. We do not anticipate that, even if there were no embargo, there would be a flood of new issues by foreign borrowers on a scale which would prevent any further rise in the prices of gilt-edged stocks. The effect of opening the London market to foreign borrowers to the full extent which their commercial credit permitted would be increased by the psychological reactions. With this resource behind them, governments would be able to pursue a more liberal policy both in the field of foreign exchange and in that of internal development. The right to float loans at their own convenience would be of as great importance to them as the actual loans which they might think it was wise to raise. We have already referred to the benefits which an improvement in the financial position of these governments would entail. It would probably lead to a higher level of consumption in the countries concerned, which would directly benefit our export industries; and to a relaxation of the pressure to exjDort, which has had such disastrous effects on those branches of our economy with which these exports compete. We are aware that there is some possibility that the removal of the embargo would for a time depress sterling relatively to the franc and dollar; there is sufficient force in this contention to persuade us that the embargo should still apply to issues for the purpose of repaying loans contracted in dollars, or in one of the gold currencies.66. Nor do we hold that the embargo should be lifted unconditionally. Power might well be retained to refuse permission for loans to countries which pursued economic or financial policies adverse to British interests. Further, measures should be taken to ensure some general supervision with a view to preventing such a flow of new issues as would embarrass the market or prejudice gravely the exchanges. Subject to these qualifications, Ave suggest that any country within the sterling area should be permitted to raise loans in the London market so far as its commercial credit permits.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 11, 1934.o
