This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet December, 1934SECRETCopy No. 39CP. 282 (34)THE CABINETREGIMENTAL CHARITABLE FUNDS bill memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARAmong the important Bills (in category C, i.e., for introduction only if time permits) approved for introduction during the current Session at the Cabinet meeting on 24th October, 1934 (Cabinet Conclusions 36 (34)), was a small War Office Bill described as the Military Savings Banks Act (Amendment) Bill. Its object is to release certain Regimental Charitable Funds from the Military Savings Banks, to which they were compulsorily transferred in 1849, and to transfer them to the United Services Trustee, with whom funds of this description are now ordinarily deposited. In their present position they are subject to unnecessary regulation and supervision, and this Bill puts an end to a form of special control which has become an anomaly, and gives the particular regiments the same degree of freedom as that already enjoyed by others. It is important to introduce it at the earliest possible moment in order to take advantage of the high price of the securities and enable the transfer to be carried out without loss to the public. The Bill (now the Regimental Charitable Funds Bill) has been drafted, and I ask formal authority to submit it to the Home Affairs Committee at their next meeting.H.The War Office,3rd December, 1934.(b34/8)   70   12/34   w.o.p.   s241
