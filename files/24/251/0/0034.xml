-    184THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITaNNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV1SRNMENT.CABINETSecret.tCP.259(34) Copy Ho    ^ X-RIBBON DEVELOPMENT;Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Ministerof Transport.The Cabinet have decided that the King-r8 Speech is to contain a promise that, if time permits, legislation will be introduced for controlling building development along the ma in thorough!ares.Within the last three years, Surrey, Middlesex and E  ox County Councils have each obtained from parliament private Acts, which give some powers to check the abuse of ribbon development.     These Acts give the Councils power,  subject to possible liability for compensation,  to acquire or to sterilise land to substantial depths on either side of specified &quot;main thoroughfares&quot; and to restrict access to those thoroughfares. Strong demands are being made by the County Councils&apos; Association,  the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, the Oxford and Cambridge Preservation Societies and other bodies to the effect that other County Councils should be granted like power, without each one of them being put to the expense attendant upon private Bill legislation.The situation has been closely examined by our respective Departments in consultation with the Treasury,  and the conclusion reached that a Bill conferring on County Councils generally powers similar to those granted by the Private Acts referred to would be a relatively short and simple matter and should not meet with strong opposition in Parliament.      On the other hand, examination of the problem suggests strongly that a
Bill on those linos will fall short of a complete remedy even in the more wealthy ana advanced Counties and would he little more than a deed letter in many carte of the country.      Our Departments have elaborated proposals for more comprehensive and drastic measures,  the object of which would be to enable County Councils, without liability to pay compensation,  to impose on frontagers on the principal roads a degree of control which though less severe than that secured by the Private Acts, would, mitigate the worst evils of ribbon development.These proposals would undoubtedly excite opposition from some quarters and the passage of the Pill through a Standing Committee might well be a difficult one.The prospects of a Bill containing both the Private Act previsions and the wider proposals must largely depend on the exigencies of the parliamentary time-table and the position in this respect will be clearer towards the end of the Christmas recess.      We therefore ask the Cabinet to authorise the preparation of a Bill on the wider lines on the understanding that the question whether the -wider or narrower Bill should be introduced will be referred to them again.A further reason for adopting this course lies in the fact that the position may be altered if approval is given to proposals at present under discussion between the Treasury,  the Minister of Health, trie Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State for Scotland,  for the transfer to the Minister of Transport of direct responsibility for a substantial number of the more important roads in the country.      If it should prove possible to introduce a Bill on this subject in the course of the present Session, there may well be advantages in combining both the proposals which are not unconnected in a single measure.(Intld.)
