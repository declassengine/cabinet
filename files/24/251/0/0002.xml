4.3 DOCUMENT IS THE PkOPJSBTY OF HI3 IRITA^NIC MAJESTY1S (TOVKRNMT) .c r b t.P. 227 (34).COPY MO.       /0 a BIN E T,COaOITTEE on the reports op tj-ie investigators into the depressed areas.INTERIM REPORT.1. At their Meeting on 10th October, 1934, (Cabinet 34 (34)Conclusion 9)  the Cabinet agreed :-That a Cabinet Committee composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair), The Secretary of State for scotland or rerjresentative, The Minister of Health, The President of the Board of trade or representative, The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesor representative, The Minister of Labour, The First Commissioner of Works, withThe Chief Industrial Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government,should examine the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee (Paper CP. 2S0 (34)) on the Reports of the Investigators into the Depressed Areas (Paper CP. 8-17 (34)), and should report to the Cabinet as soon as practicable on the various recommendations of the Investigators and also on the question whether the Reports of the Investigators should be published, and,  if so, in what form.The Committee submit the following Interim Report. 2.       The briefest consideration of the Reports of the Investigators suggests that a policy which is confined to those proposals in the Reports which it is possible to accept and to carry out through the machinery of Govern-in en t Departments is unlikely to satisfy the expectations that have been created in all quarters by the appointment of the Investigators.      It seems necessary therefore to consider additional measures.
5.     A number of proposals have been made, both in the Reports and elsewhere, and doubtless there are others which will be brought forward which, owing to their nature, are not appropriate for Government Departments to undertake or assist,      So..e of these, however, might well be tried as experiments;    both because they are valuable in themselves,  and, because the fact of their being tried would have an important psychological effect in persuading the persons in the Depressed Areas that the Government had their plight very much at heart. Schemes for improving the amenities of the areas in order to make them more attractice for industrial undertakings (e.g. by levelling slag heaps or clearing up derelict industrial sites)  or schemes for setting up co-operative colonies are examples of schemes which could not appropriately be undertaken by Government Departments but which for the reasons given above would yet be worth trying.4. At the same time the Reports raise a number of questions which require detailed and continuous examination.5. The considerations discussed above suggest thatin order to make further progress some special machinery should be established having a large measure of-2-
flexibility ana. considerable freedom of action. Only in this way will it be possible to obtain that willingness to try experiments with the risk of failure, and of their having to be subsequently abandoned, which is necessary if experiments outside the limits of normal Departmental action are to be tried.6. These desiderata could be met,  it appears tothe Committee, by the appointment of a Commissioner to take charge of all special measures in the Depressed Areas.      The duties and functions of the Commissioner will need very careful definition, and before proceeding to work out a detailed scheme the Committee desire to submit the proposal for the approval of the Cabinet in principle.    There are, however,  certain aspects of the suggestion which need to be referred to at this stage.7. Broadly the Commissioner would &quot;be responsiblefor the initiation,  organisation and prosecution of schemes designed to facilitate the economic develop-ment and social improvement of the four Areas surveyed by the Investigators,    primarily he should devote himself to work which could not be done under existing powers.    He w:?uld not he empowered to subsidise ordinary industrial undertakings.,
8.,      Per obese pur-poses the necessary financial resources would be placed, at his disposal, in the expenditure of which he should have wide discretion. As he will not bo subject to detailed control the Commissioner should be able, with the minimum of delay, to finance or to a ssist to finance schemes which&apos; a Government Department could undertake,if at all, only after considerable delay.9,      The Commissioner should be subject to the general control of the Minister of Labour.    But the relations between the Minister and the Commissioner will need to be carefully laid down;    it is undesirable that the Minister should be held responsible by the House of Commons for the day to day actions of the Commissioner since this would both be embarrassing to the Government and would also tend to destroy his freedom of action which is one of the principal objects of the scheme.10,    It is important to emphasize the experimental nature of the proposals;   for, unless the works to be undertaken in connection with the scheme can be differentiated on this ground from similar works in other parts of the country the Government will be embarrassed by demands for financial assistance from other areas which regard themselves as depressed.    Moreover, if from the beginning each individual scheme is regarded as an experiment, its abandonment later,  should this become necessary, will not be so embarrassing either to the Government or to the Commissioner.11.    The Commissioner should have an agent resident in each of the 4 areas who will be responsible for the work to be carried out in that area.    The Commissioner and the four Agents will be px^provided with adequate staffs,
-    2(112.    The Commissioner&apos;s relations with Local Authorities will also need very careful definition.      He should not intervene in such a way as to relieve the Local Authority of any of the duties laid upon the Authority by Statute,      At the same time it seems likely that many of the most valuable of the activities of the Commissioner will be in connection with matters falling within the territory of Local Authorities and for which it will be essential -co obtain their co-operation.    In such matters it is contemplated that the Commissioner will carry out experi-mental sohemveu for the welfare of the area in partnership with the Local Authorities.13.    In this connection the question-of Housing schemes raises special difficulties.    It is not contemplated that the Commissioner should make contributions towards the cost of housing schemes, as such; as this would tend to cut across the general housing policy.      There would not, however, be the same objection    to the Commissioner entering into an agreement with, a Local Authority whereby as part of a Town planning scheme he would undertake to clear a site on which perhaps houses might afterwards be erected by the Local Authority.14.    Legislation will be required to confer the necessary powers on the Commissioner e.g. powers for the compulsory acquisition of land,,15.    It will be seen that a, great deal remains to be considered in connection with this proposal, but the matters mentioned above will perhaps serve to show the Cabinet the sort of machinery which the Committee have in mind.16.    The Secretary of State for Scotland desires to reserve for the moment questions such as his relations with the Commissioner and possibly whether the appointment of a separate Commissioner for Scotland should not be contemplated.

rjisfer and 17.    All the Investigators agree that industrialaining.transference must continue to be a major part of the policy for dealing with the younger and more mobile sections of the workers in the Depressed Areas.      In Fart II of the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee, a number of proposals are submitted designed to increase the volume of industrial transference from the depressed to more prosperous areas and dealing also with the connected policy of training.In regard to one of these proposals - in certain circumstances that Government contractors and Local Authorities should be required to engage their labour through the Employment Exchanges - the Committee have invited the Ministry of Labour to define this suggestion more exactly.Another proposal - for the grant of additional money for welfare work to the National Council of Social Service and the Scottish Council - must wait for a decision on proposals which are put forward above regarding the machinery of assistance.Subject to these observations the Committee are in general agreement with the  suggestions made in Part II of the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Transference,    training and cognate subjects.      They understand that the Treasury has not yet had time to consider all these proposals in detail, and the Committee&apos;s recommendation that the Cabinet should approve the proposals in principle is subject to Treasury approval of the financial aspects and to the settlement of details between the Treasury, the Ministry of Labour, and any other Departments, or bodies concerned.
13.      The Committee have considered the question of the publication of the Investigators&apos; Reports. Despite repeated assertions on behalf of the Government that the Reports would not be published, the general consensus of opinion on the Committee is that it would oe less embarrassing for the Government if they are now published.It will be necessary to obtain the consent of the Investigators to this course as the latter were assured that the Reports would be treated as confidential it is not anticipated that any of them will object to publications indeed there is reason to believe that some of them would welcome publication.There are, however, certain passages in the Reports which it would be undesirable to publish. Accordingly when the permission of the Investigators is being sought for publication they should be invited to examine the Reports again with a view to making any alterations which they think necessary having regard to the decision to publish.Subject to this the Committee recommend to the Cabinet that the Reports of the Investigators should be published.
19.       The Committee submit the following interimrecommendations to the Cabinet  :-(l) That approval in principle should be given to the proposal that the four Depressed Areas should be treated as special fields for experiment and research, with a view to the initiation, organisation, and prosecution of schemes designed to facilitate the economic development and social improvement of the areas.(S) That for the purposes of (l)  above,a Commissioner responsible to the minister of Labour should be appointed with Agents resident in each of the four areas respectively.    The Commissioner to be entrusted with the powers necessary to enable him to carry out the duties and functions briefly outlined in this Report.(3) That on the reassembling of parliamentan announcement should be made of the above proposals, emphasis &quot;being laid on their novel and experimental character.    At the same time it should be intimated in general terms that effect will be given to certain of the recommendations contained in the Reports of the Investigators in the Depressed Areas, but, as it is desirable that attention should not be diverted from the new scheme, references to detailed recommendations in the Reports should, so far as possible, be avoided.(4)  That,  subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to finance, the proposals contained in Part II of the Keoort of the Inter-Departmental Committee (CP.  2SO (34)) on transference and training should be appiroved in principle.(5) That, subject to the consent and approval of the Investigators,  the four Reports should be published, but that before publication the Investigators themselves should delete from the Reports all inform-atiori and other matters given to them in confidence in the course of their enquiries.(6) That prior to publication of the Reports, it should be announced that the Government had consulted the Investigators and had obtained their consent and approval to publication.-S-
(7) To take note that the Committee are carefully examining the various -points for decision set out in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee1s Deport (0.?.  220 (34)). and that the Committee propose to submit a further Deport to theCabinet v/hen this examination is completed.Signed on behalf of the CommiuteeNEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN c CHAIRMAN.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 22nd October, 1934.
