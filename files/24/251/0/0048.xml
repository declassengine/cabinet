THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No.   36CP. 273 (34).CABINET.THE IRISH FREE STATE SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY colleagues may like to have the following brief statement of the principal developments in the Irish Free State situation since the date of my memorandum OP. 122 (34) :-Political.Suggestions for Settlement of Dispute.2. In August Lord Granard informed me of talks which he had recently had with Mr. de Valera, as a result of which he had received a written statement of Mr. de Valera&apos;s views in the following terms: &quot; The linking up of the political with the financial and trade dispute was done by the British, not by the Saorstat Government.&quot; The Saorstat Government is and has all along been willing to discuss the financial and trade issues apart from political questions. The British Government was informed of that attitude in 1932.&quot;3. I informed Lord Granard that I had not been able to consult my colleagues but that, for my own part, I saw great difficulties over anjr discussions limited to the financial and trade issues, leaving outstanding the political questions. I thought, therefore, that the only answer which Lord Granard could convey to Mr. de Valera would be on the following lines : &quot; The United Kingdom Government have made it clear on several occasions that, if a satisfactory basis for discussion can be found, they are ready at any time to enter into negotiations with the Irish Free State Government for the settlement of all outstanding questions.&quot; They would welcome any suggestions which might be put forward as likely to afford such a basis.&quot;4. Lord Granard has since communicated to me a fuller memorandum which, though prepared by him, may, I gather from him, be taken to have Mr. de Valera&apos;s endorsement; I have already circulated to the Irish Situation Committee the complete text of this memorandum and of the correspondence referred to in the two preceding paragraphs. The substance of the memorandum is that the only hope of success lies in attacking the problem piecemeal and that, having regard to the effect of the dispute on United Kingdom export trade, and in particular the coal trade, it would be in the interests of the United Kingdom as well as of the Irish Free State, to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the trade and financial issues (without prejudice to the political issues) which Mr. de Valera is quite ready to do.Irish Free State Citizenship Bill.5.   The Irish Free State Government have introduced a Bill to define Irish Free State citizenship which, inter alia, repeals the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts in their application to the Irish Free State and, in certain-respects, provides qualifications for Irish Free State citizenship differing from the [10814]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1934.
qualifications at present, by agreement between the Members of the British Commonwealth, prescribed by law for the possession of British nationality. As a result of consideration by the Irish Situation Committee a despatch was sent to the Irish Free State Government in July stating that it did not appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that the proposed legislation could be regarded as making provision for the maintenance of the &quot; common status &quot; as contemplated in the conclusions of the Imperial Conference of 1930 relating to nationality. The Irish Free State Government have replied that the view of the common status referred to in that despatch &apos;&apos; is not one in which representatives of this State at any time concurred.&quot; The Second Reading debate in the Dail opened recently and was adjourned until the 28th November.Statements by Mr. J. H. Morgan, K.C.6. At a recent meeting of the Irish Loyalist Imperial Federation (of which Lord Carson is President) a resolution was passed calling upon the Government &quot; to declare its intentions in regard to the repeated violations of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.&quot; In speaking to the resolution, Mr. J. H. Morgan, K.C., stated that &quot; Mr. de Valera both could and would declare a Republic,&quot; and that all that was necessary for Mr. de Valera&apos;s purpose was to obtain recognition of Irish independence by one foreign power, e.g., Germany.7. Mr. Morgan further asserted that German vessels were, in secrecy, unloading cargoes of arms in Irish ports. On this point, there is no information available which supports this assertion. Our sources of information have, from time to time, sent in reports of secret shipments of arms from continental ports to the Irish Frep. State. But the destination in the Fr.ee State of these arms is quite uncertain, and it is thought not improbable that they were intended for the Opposition-either Blue Shirts or the Irish Republican Army extremists  rather than for the Government.General Position in the Irish Free State.8. It seems the general view that Mr. de Valera&apos;s own position has become, if anything, stronger during recent months. His hold on his supporters has in no way lessened; his opponents have been seriously weakened by the recent dispute between General 0&apos;Duffy and Mr. Cosgrave, resulting in General 0&apos;Duffy&apos;s retirement from the party leadership, and the splitting into two of the Blue Shirt organisation.9. Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude was defined in his speech at the recent annual meeting of his party as follows : &quot; Their purpose was to achieve their age-long ambition of making the country a nation amongst the nations. They in the Fianna Fail would not regard the country as being a nation among the nations until a completely united Ireland had taken its place as an independent Republic.&quot;-v  ; Economic and Financial.Trade between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State.10. As regards total trade between the two countries, the total imports into the Irish Free State from the United Kingdom for the first eight months of 1934 amounted to  17-1 million out Of a total import of  26 million, or 67 per cent.; in the corresponding period of 1932,  24^ million out of  31 million, or 78,per cent. Thus, in two years, the total Irish Free State import trade from this.&apos;, country has decreased by  6f million, or 28 per cent., and&apos; the proportion held by this country has fallen by 11 per cent..:&apos;,The principal losses, so far as exports from the United Kingdom to the Irish Free State are concerned, have occurred in respect of coal and cement. Thus coal exports have declined from  1,392,000 in the first eight months of 1932 to  617,000 in the first eight months of 1934-a decrease of 55 per cent.; cement has fallen from  188,000 to  40,000 in the same period a decrease of 78 per cent.11. Irish Free State exports to the United Kingdom for the same periods were, in 1934,  10f million out of  11^ million (94 per cent.); and in 1932,  17*; million out of  I7f million (97 per cent).   The Irish Free State export
trade to the United Kingdom has thus decreased in the two years by  6^ million, or 38 per cent.12. Whilst, however, the trade with the Irish Free State, though important, is only a small part of the total external trade of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom still forms practically the only market for Irish Free State exports. Though the total external trade of the Irish Free State has suffered a serious decline during the last two years, the total external trade of the United Kingdom has increased.   The figures are as follows : Exports  Million  .First eight months of 1934 ... ... 255First eight months of 1932 ... ... 245Imports First eight months of 1934 ... ... 479First eight months of 1932 ... ... 466Economic Measures in the Irish Free State.13. Mr. de Valera has continued unabated his policy of attempting, on the one hand, to establish secondary industiies in the Irish Free State and, on the other, to diminish the volume of surplus agricultural produce (which formerly was exported). Under the first head, use has been made of the Control of Imports Act passed earlier this year to prohibit the import, except under licence, of such goods as boots and shoes, rubber tyres, and completed motor cars, in order to assist the factories which have been, or are being, set up to manufacture boots and shoes, tyres (a subsidiary of the Dunlop Company) and the assembly of motor cars. On the other side, constant pressure has been employed to increase the turnover from pasture to arable land; and measures have recently been adopted to secure the slaughter of surplus cattle, including the distribution of free supplies of meat to the poor at Government expense.Unemployment.14. Notwithstanding the efforts made to develop industries in the Irish Free State, the unemployment returns show a continued increase in the number of unemployed. The latest return, for the 5th November, gives the total live register as 119,423, of which 108,742 were men. Similar figures for the 17th September were 107,411, of which 97,338 were men the increase between the two dates has been at a steady rate of about 3,000 a week.Irish Free State Defaults and the Receipts from Special Duties.15. The total Irish Free State default up to the 31st March, 1934, was  9,673,995, and the estimated default for the current year is  4,839,000. (The actual cost falling on United Kingdom votes, which is less by the omission of certain sinking fund and other payments, was, up to the 31st March, 1934,  6,948,200, and the estimate for the current year is  3,519,724.) Receipts of duty on Irish Free State goods under the Irish Free State (Special Duties) Act, 1932, amounted to  6,490,900 up to the 31st March, 1934; the estimated receipts for the current year amount to  3,560,000 (of which a little more than a half was collected in the first six months).Conclusion.16. My own feeling is that, for the moment, there is not sufficient justifica-tion for any change in our general policy, which may be summarised as a policy of making any approach to a settlement of the financial dispute conditional on a recognition by the Free State of its position as a member of the British Common-wealth. At the same time, we ought to be ready to take advantage of any opening for improving relations, and especially commercial relations, between the two countries and, in particular, we must be constantly on the watch for any opportunity for negotiations which may seem to offer a real prospect of a satisfactory settlement.(Initialled) J. H. T.Dominions Office, November 1934.
