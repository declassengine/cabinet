^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPISRTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT. ET*.COPY NO._,356(34).CABINET. GERMAN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade. At the meeting of the Cabinet last Wednesday (94th October) it was agreed that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should be authorised to proceed with his negotiations at Berlin for a Clearing Agreement based on the &quot;Single Account system&quot;.    On the same day the German representatives, acting under instructions from Dr. Schacht, put forward an alternative proposal which was designed to avoid the necessity of imposing any Clearing at all in connection with Anglo-German trade.Briefly this alternative proposal amounts to a definite undertaking by the German Government that the Reichsbank should set aside 55)o of the value of German exports to the United Kingdom for the payment of United Kingdom exports to Germany.    In order that, under these arrangements a new block of frozen debts shall not be allowed to pile up, the German Government would only issue import certificates for the quantity of imports which they can reasonably expect to pay for. They would undertake to consult with us in exercising this control, and particularly to give special consideration to exports which are important to us from the point of view of employment, viz: coal, herrings and certain textiles.A further 10% of the value of German exports to the United Kingdom would be set aside for the liquidation of the outstanding commercial debts and furthermore the German Government would undertake to arrange a credit (based on a mobilisation of outstanding German commercial claims on the United Kingdom) with the object of paying off the whole, or as large as possible a part, of the outstanding debts in cash.By arrangement with the Governor of the Bank of England the German Government would make an immediate advance payment
of  400,000 on account of this credit operation which could be allocated at once towards the outstanding.commercial debts0   At the same time the Clearing Agreement, on the basis agreed by the Cabinet last Wednesday, would be finally settled and initialled and would be annexed to this alternative agreement which should provide that the Clearing Arrangement would be brought into force in the event of the alternative scheme proving unworkable,.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I considered these proposals and agreed that in the circumstances it was a proposal we should do well to accept.   We are both impressed with the desirability of avoiding a Clearing if satisfaction could be obtained by other means, and indeed we only proposed a Clearing because we understood that the German Government could not meet our wishes in any other way.   As the present Anglo-German Exchange Agreement comes to an end on Wednesday, October 31st it was necessary to decide our attitude at once, and there was no opportunity to consult the Cabinet.    v,&apos;e accordingly instructed Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to proceed on these lines, and on October 27th he addressed a letter to Dr. Schacht setting out the conditions under which we were ready to accept this arrangement (see Annex l).   Dr. Schacht accepted the conditions laid down in Sir Frederick Leith-Ross&apos;s letter on the same day, subject to agreement being reached on certain outstanding technical questions (see Annex 2).   A copy of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross&apos;s acknowledgment is attached (see Annex 3).The technical points referred to are now in course ofdiscussion and it is hoped that final agreement will be reached in the course of Wednesday or by Thursday norning at thelatest.    As soon as final agreement is thus reached thenecessary announcement can be nade in the House of Commons andthe Agreement can be simultaneously published here   and inBerlin.Board of Trade,30th October, 1934.
ANNEX I.October 27th, 1934.Dear Dr. Schacht,As I have told you, my Government has had no desire to make a Clearing arrangement, believing that it would be injurious to the trade of both countries, and the object of my visit last month was to explore every possibility of meeting our requirements without a Clearing, Unfortunately at that time I found that on every point the German representatives were unable to give me any proposal to meet our requirements except within the framework of a. Clearing.     My Government accordingly sent me here to negotiate a Clearing arrangement, and It is very late for them now to reverse their decision.I have, however, been in communication with my Ministers, and I am authorised to state that they would be prepared to contemplate an alternative arrangement subject to the following conditions.(a) My Government does not desire to press Germany to Import more from the United Kingdom than she can pay for, but in recent months German exports to the United Kingdom have been maintained or increased so that the Reichsbank should have received   ample sterling resources to cover the normal imports from the United Kingdom,      In fact, however, the United Kingdom exports to Germany have not only increased but they have not been paid for.     If a Clearing is not to be adopted, my Government must have an assurance that not less than
55;c of the value of German., exports to the United Kingdom as shown in the Bri tish statistics will he allocated for the payment of United Kingdom exports to Germany,,     Apart from this, my   Government would, require the same assurances as the,7 have ashed for in the Clearing negotiations in regard bo the maintenance of specific classes of United Kingdom exports,  the re-export trade, Colonial trade, and payment of freights, insurances, etc.(h) The possibility of abandoning a Clearing is entirely conditional on definite and satisfactory assurances for the liquidation of the frozen trade debts due to the United Kingdom.     My Government understand that you propose to negotiate a credit with the object of paying off the whole, or as large as possible a part of these debts in cash and that you will use your best endeavour to conclude these negotiations as rapidly as possible.      buch an arrangement would be satisfactory to my Government, but the negotiations will inevitably take a certain time and my Government must stipulate that an advance payment of not less than  4 00,000 should be made by the Reichsbank forthwith on account of the credit operation.     Further,  as from the date of the agreement,  a percentage allocation must be set aside out of the proceeds of German exports to the United Kingdom sufficient to liquidate by instalments within a period of tvrelve months any balance that cannot be discharged by means of the credit operation.(o) The special question of the arrears under the
Sonderaam Agreement also hae to be provided for. The Bank of England must, of course, continue to sell Sonderuiarks until the balances in the account and in the waiting list have been disposed of, and the Reichsbank should undertake to afford any reasonable facilities asKed for by the Bank of England with a view to expediting the disposal of these balances.    But there is only a limited naricet in London for these Sondermarics and in the absence of any other possibilities, their liquidation will have to be provided out of the 55 per cent, allocation for United Kingdom exports, either as a first charge or by three monthly instalments.    Either of these alternatives will of course affect payment of current trade and my Government would be glad to know if you see any other solution.(d) My Government, as you know, cannot contemplate any suspension in the full transfer of the Dawes and Young Loans.    This question was settled until the 51st December next by the Transfer Agreement concluded last July.    If we are to avoid a Clearing, my Government will require to be assured that the full payment of all coupons of the Dawes and Young Loans belonging to British holders will be continued.     As regards the non-Reich Loans, the bondholders last July agreed to a funding scheme in accordance with the ReichsbanK proposal of last May, provider&quot; that there was no discrimination against  them.    They have since notified us. that they regard the Swiss and Dutch arrangements as constituting such discrimination and that they reserve the right to basic for similar treatment.    I cannot at
the a on exit say what attitude the bondholders of the non-Reich Loans would take, but if it would help you, ay Government would be prepared to use its influence with them to get them to accept a definite funding scheme for all coupons of the non-Reich Loans for a period of, say, 2 years as from 1st July 1934, without any provision as&quot;to non-discrimination, provided that the interest rate on these funding bonds was raised to 4L, the other conditions remaining ss /before.If you are in a position to inform me that the above conditions are acceptable to the German Government, my Government would authorise me to draw up an agreement with you on this basis which would be signed and brought into force as from 1st November next. Their hope is that such an agreement, if once adopted, would work to the satisfaction of both countries:   but the usual provision would have to be inserted enabling eitner party to denounce it after,  say, one month1s notice.     In that event, It would be in the interest of both countries that we should obviate the- necessity of further protracted negotiations by putting into force the Clearing arrangement which we have been negotiating.     Accordingly, my Government consider that the Clearing arrangement should be initialled and that it should be part of our agreement that it should be brought into force if the alternative now proposed proves unworkable.1 trust that these proposals will be acceptable to the German Government.     I have had
great trouble in persuading my Government to authorise them as it will he difficult, both from the political and from the administrative standpoint, not to cancel the arrangements made for a Clearing:     and it can only be done if a favourable reply to this letter can be received not later than tomorrow. I hope that youwill be in a position to give me such a reply.Yours sincerely,(Sd) P.W.  LUITH R03S.S.H.Herrn Reichsbankprasident Dr Schacht.
