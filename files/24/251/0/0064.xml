*        -programme o  pev/ construction for JI935. Memo ^&quot;by the plrst Lord of the ..dmiralty^The following is the hew construction programme which I ask the cabinet to approve for inclusion in the Navy estimates for 1935,-3 Cruisers (MINOTAUR type).1 Leader and 8 Destroyers.3 submarines (One Minelayer submarine ore &quot;p&quot; or general service type5 one &quot;s&quot; or patrol type)o1 submarine Depot ship.4 sloops (three Kinesweeping sloops and one convey slocp) 1 surveying ship.7 Small vessels  (namely two coastal Sloops9 one smallMinelayers two Gate vessels and two Trawlers)o2o      This is a normal replacement programmes  and is the same as that which was included in the provisional forecast given to the Defence Requirements Committees  except that it is now considered necessary to provide 2 Coastal Sloops instea of 1.CRUISERSa3o      under Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty, we may lay down before the 31st December 1936 replacement tonnage for cruisers already over-age on that date9 and cruisers becoming over-age in 1937s 1938 and 1939.    on this basis? in 1934s 1935 and 1936 a total not exceeding 86s55o tons of 6&quot; cruisers may be laid down..    The 1934 programme accounted for 32sQ5o tons a leaving 54s300 tons available for the 1935 and 1936 Programmes.THIS DOCUMENT 12 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY TSGOVERNMENT-
-   o   -4.      in 1934-9 for reason a with which my colleagues are familiar? we found it necessary to provide for 4 new cruisers-    The question of the replacement of H.m.a*3.brisbane has now been settled by the transfer to the commonwealth Government of one of the three cruisers of the modified L3AEDEII type &quot;belonging to the 1932 programme and due to complete in 1935.    por 1955, therefore, we rovert to our normal quota of s.5.      as the Cabinet is aware, we have been conrpelled to produce a new type of cruiser, the &quot;m&quot; Class, in reply to the large 6&quot; gun cruisers now being built by the U&quot;oa* and japan. The TjoSoA&quot; has laid down 4 and ordered 3 more of these vessels, and japan has 4 laid down and 2 more projected. \7e, for our part? included 2 such ships in the 1933 programme and 3 in the programme for 1934, a total of 5.   we hope that it may be possible to isolate this class by international agreement, as was done with 8&quot; gun cruisersj but our probable ultimate requirement is 10 such ships, and we accordingly propose to include 3 in  the 1935 programme.    These will absorb about 27,000 tons, leaving some 27,300 tons for the 1936 programme, if it is still restricted by the terms of Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty.DS^TJROYLPSo.6.      under ;.rticle 19 of the London Naval Treaty, we may lay down before the 31st December 1936 replacement tonnage for Destroyers already over-age on that date, and Destroyers bocoming over-age in 1937 and 1938.    on this basis, in 1934, 1935 and 1936 a total not exceeding 63,471 tons may be laid down. The 1954 programme accounts for about 12s5oo tons, leaving about 51,000 tons available for the 1935 and 1936 programmes,    ye propose to continue our steady replacement programme by providing one new flotilla in 1935, which will absorb only
about 12,500 tons of the total.7.      under Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty, we may lay down before the 31st December 1936 replacement tonnage for submarines already over-age on the date,  and submarines becoming over-age in 1937, 1938 and 1939.    on this basis, we have lo,486 tons available for the three programmes, of which 2,900 tons have already been taken for the programme for 1934.8.      our policy, failing international agreement for the abolition of submarines, is an ultimate reduction of submarine tonnage to 40a000 tons, but even should this figure be generally accepted, which is doubtful, it could not be achieved for a long time,    wo must therefore, if we are in the meantime to maintain our position in relation to foreign powers, continue to pursue a steady programme for replacing our over-age vessels, and we accordingly propose to include in the present programme, as in previous programmes since the Treaty, 3 new submarines.    These will absorb about 3,250 tons,leaving 4,336 tons available for the 1936 programme if it is still restricted as at present.OTHER VESSELS,:9. The submarine Depot Ship is required to replace the CYCLOPS, which was completed in 19o7 and whose hull life will expire in 1937-8.10-    The three Sloop Minesweepers and the surveying ship are also required to replace existing vessels which will soon become unfit for further service.    It is proposed that the Surveying Ship shall be so designed as to &quot;be capable of employment as a sloop Minesweeper in the event of war.    The Convoy sloops, as I explained when the first vessel of this type was included in the 1933 programme, are intended for anti-submarineescort ..o o o
escort duties in war and are of a simple design admitting of rapid construction in an emergency-        certain number of Convoy sloops? however? can be economically employed in peace on duties now carried out by sloops? and two are included in the programme for this reason..llo    Of the smaller vessels? the coastal sloops are required in replacement of patrol Boats and Fishery protection O-unboats v/hose hull lives will shortly expire.    The small Minelayer is required to replace one of four small ex-Monitors which in -peace are used on mining instructional work and in war would be required for laying defensive minefields in home waters.    The Gate vessels are required in connection with 30om Defence.    Trawlers are employed in peace on minesv/eeping and submarine training? fishery protection and other duties. Tho hull lives of the 19 vessels which we have will expire between 1957 and 1943.    It is therefore necessary to start a steady replacement programme which should be not less than two vessels a year.12.    A financial statement? showing the total estimated cost of the programme and the probable spread of the expenditure over the financial years affected? is  appended.13.    ft will be seen that the amount to be included in the 1935 estimates for commencing the new programme is slightly larger1 than the sum which has been provided for the purpose in recent years ( 75,000 as against  50,000)-    The additional provision is required for steam and motor boats? and does not indicate any earlier placing of the orders for ships.(intlld.)
