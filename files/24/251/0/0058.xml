(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s government) .SECRETCP.285(54) Copy No,CAB I N E TINDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 14th December, 1954,Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated 14th Deoemoer, 1934, issued on the authority of the Secretary of Statefor L-idia.The general election to the Legislative Assembly and the publication of the Joint Parliamentary Committee&apos;s Heport are events of outstanding, not to say historical, interest.The result of the elections may be tabulated roughly as follows:-   Congress 42, Nationalist (Congress followers of Malaviya) 9, Muslim Unity Board (Muslim Nationalists) 3, Sikhs 2, Burmese (separationists) 5, others 45.      To form a correct appreciation of these results there are certain points which it is necessary to emphasise.(a) The general public in the Provinces, especially in the rural areas, take little interest in the workof the Assembly;    in so far as they take interest in political questions, they are more interested in questions dealt with by Provincial Councils, e.g. administration of transferred subjects, lav/ and order questions in Provinces or legislation dealing with local problems, such as tenancies, rural indebtedness, etc.(b) In consequence of this, persons of local influence are reluctant to seek election for the Assembly for (1) owing to the unwieldy size of all constituencies and the absence of any organised party to support them, very heavy personal expenditure is involved.      The vast areas coveredby existing constituencies is perhaps not fully realised generally, though description is given in Vol.I of the Simon Report, and the point has been fully appreciated by the Joint Select Committee;    (2) work as members of the   Assembly necessitates long absence from their home districts
2.and does not add materially to their local prestige or their influence with their Local Governments.(c) Congress is the only organised All-India political party ana is able to carry on an intensive political campaign owing to its funds, its influence over a large section of the press and the large number available to carry out canvassing.    All Local Governments stress the point that the success of Congress candidates is largely cue to superior organisation.(d) At the last general election Congress boycotted, the election entirely.    There was a very small percentage of contested elections (39 out of 104).    Successful candidates represented no political party, -were in many cases men of small local influence and have not increased that influence by work in the Assembly, whether in opposition or support of Government.    During the lifetime of the Assembly they have lost touch with their constituencies and no party organisation is available to nurse their constituencies in their absence.    Congress candidates, on the other hand, by their civil disobedience activities or otherwise, have kept themselves in the public eye and some are probably, apart from these activities, men of considerable local influence.    Thus, North-West Frontier province regard the election of Dr. Khan Sahib as partly due to his personal popularity,  especially in Peshawar,  and the success of a Congress candidate in Assam was also attributed partly to the fact that the sitting member was of a lower caste.(e) It is, of course,  contended that the electionwas fought on the straight issue of the reforms proposals even though Congress put forward no alternative proposals, but it would be more correct to say that Congress candidates
o.merely indulged in destructive criticism end abuse of the Government.    The converse of the. Congress-picture was never put before the electorates, end,  indeed,  this cannot he done under present conditions, 10 r the Government and its officers are bound to adopt an attitude of strict neutrality end cannot take any pert in the -elections-    The sitting member, undo.- the ^handicaps already mentioned,  cannot show that he has done anything substantial for his constituents, end the fate of those who have habitually opposed the Government and who differ out little from their Congress successors has been  the same as of those who have supported the Government.    The ordinary elector, knowing little of ,-.11-India political questions,  is influenced by sentimental considerations, sympathises with a candidate who is &quot;agin the Government&quot; and who has perhaps suffered for his opinions,  and hopes, in a vague sort of way,  that  support of a Congress candidate or a change of his presents candidate may do-him some good and,  in any case,  can do him no harm.    Those with any steice iii the country arc apathetic,  as they fool  that in present conditions,  if their vested, interests are attacked,  they will be protected by the Government. This accounts for tho apathy of the landholdera in the United Provinces ana for their fdhure   to organise. The Chief Secretary &quot;to  the Government of tho United-Provinces reports that owing to apathy and private quarrels landholders started their campaign too late, that  several candidates had inadequate financial resources and got little or no support fro... their friends or party organisation; owing to private quarrels, landholders in  53 me
4.cases worked against candidates standing in their own interest.      That landholders are beginning to have some glimmering of responsibility is shown by the successof anti-Congress candidates in landholders&apos; specialconstituencies in the United Provinces, Madras, Bihar,and Bengal.      The inference from this is that it is impossibleto have real elections that will genuinely reflect opinion inthe country till the electorate realises that the resultsmay clearly affect their personal interests or, in other words,till a system of a more responsible Government is set up.As regards the reception of the Joint Select Committee&apos;s Report, preliminary appreciations have been received from Local Governments, but it must be noted that these appreciations were received before the Congress Parliamentary Board had declared its policy.All Local Governments point out that it is too early to give considered views as to the practical attitude that the main parties and committees will adopt as distinct from preliminary attacks which were only to be expected.     Preliminary appreciation is based largely on newspaper opinion which is generally, as we had expected, distinctly hostile, and it remains to be seen how far newspapers reflect depth of public feeling or are capable of manufac*uring it.      The opinions of the Local Governments quoted below do not refer to detailed points of attack and criticism but merely to the o general question whether there will be a substantial body of public opinion prepared to work the constitution,Madras.    In moderate opinion there is an undercurrent of relief that the Report proposes no radical
5.change in regard to law and order.    The general feeling is that the new constitution will be accepted for what it is worth and worked so as to obtain farther advance in self government.    Threat of non-co-operation b,y  a small proportion of extremists is not to be taken  seriously, but clear&apos;ly the Report has not satisfied even moderate public opinion.Bombay.    Individual moderates, though disappointed, have advised acceptance of the scheme as an instalment. Congress leaders have all urged rejection.Bengal.    Despite disappointment at certain features, seven prominent Muslims have issued a manifesto declaring the intention of Muslims to work the reforms. Bengal Depressed Classes Association consiaers the advance real and a generous gesture from British statesmen. British India Association welcomes the constitution proposed in the Report as a definite advance towards responsible government.    European opinion appears generally satisfied with the Law and Order proposals.United Provinces.      General satisfaction among Muslims that communal award is accepted, but otherwise Muslim opinion divided between general disapproval and lukewarm co-operation.    Landlords&apos;  opinion,  so far expressed, is in favour of wonting the constitution, though not altogether satisfied with the special representation proposals.    The general public in the district are apathetic and show no indication of desire to non-co-operate no protest meetings have been arranged.    On the whole,  it seems probable that the Independents,    Liberals,
6 .Mahasabhaites, Muslims, Chambers of Commerce, Zamindars arid Talukdars will work the constitution in spite of the inevitable initial criticism, but opinion is not yet crystallised and only a very tentative forecast is possible. Congress,  though regarding the Report as in the same category of unacceptability as the ..hite Paper,  are not likely actively to non-co-operate, but this must be subject to the decision of the parliamentary Board.Punjab.    The Punjab Government analyses newspaper opinion.      Papers unite in professing disappointment but Muslim press strongly approve tne maintenance cf the communal award.    No paper has yet suggested that the constitution should not be worked.    On the contrary, a statement by tne leader of the Unionist Party that the Punjab will -work the reforms has been well advertised.Bihar.    a considerable body of moderate opinion is apparently ready to work the proposed constitution, though regarding the Report as disappointing ana more reactionary than the White paper, but the great majority are waiting for a lead from Congress.    Muhammadans generally are satisfied with the retention of the communal award and the leading Muhammadans support the Report.    In Orissa satisfaction over the extension of the boundaries is the predominant react!on.North-West Frontier province.  Say general attitude of those interested in politics is that though Ministers&apos;  powers will be restricted more than is necessary efforts must be made to work the constitution based on the Report.    There is reason -co believe that the genuine opinion of the majority is more favourable than they like to express.    Opinion appears
7 .more in favour of indirect election then before.Assam.     They consider opinions so far given are based more on a general and abstract distrust of a schema of reforms evolved in England than on considered criticisms of the hepert.Burn:a.      The Indian press adopts the Congress attitude and is very hostile to the recommendations affecting the position of Indians in Burma.     General Indian attitude will probably accord closely to press utterances and this atmosphere of hostility may have the unfortunate effect in impeding trace negotiations if it spreads to Indie. There are no indications that separationists will reject the proposals or adopt an attitude of non-co-operation.     They will probably work the constitution under protest.     Anti-separationists will decide their attitude at the Conference on 3th Lecember and may follow the Congress attitude.      It is, however,  impossible yet to estimate the strength of the extremist anti-separationist elements or the length to which they will go in resistance to the constitutional scheme.The Congress Porliamentary Board and Congress Working Committee have passed a unanimous resolution that &quot;the Joint Select Committee scheme,  designed as it &quot;is to facilitate and perpetuate domination and &quot;exploitation of this country by alien people under a &quot;costly mask,  is frought with greater mischief and &quot;danger than even the present constitution and this &quot;Committee is of opinion that every scheme should be &quot;rejected, well knowing that rejection must involve &quot;necessity of struggling under the present constitution, &quot;humiliating and intolerable as it is, until it is &quot;replaced by one framed by a Constituent Assembly in
&quot;accordance with Congress resolutions on the subject&quot;.It appears doubtful whether such a negative resolution will obtain support from moderate opinion, which will more probably follow the line already taken by Sapru and Jryakar, who, while advocating a concerted demand for alterations, are clear that i;a negative and destructive &quot;policjr may seriously affect our futtire for a long time, as &quot;indeed we are convinced that it has affected many &quot;decisions of the Committee&quot;.       Other moderates have criticised and ridiculed the suggested Constituent Assembly as a wholly impracticable proposal.      Muslim opinion is generally in favour of working the proposed constitution and. is gratified at the retention of the safeguards for their community and, in particular, of the communal decision.      To this vexing question it is to be noted that the Congress resolution makes no reference. Thus, on the issue of &quot;rejection&quot; or &quot;modification&quot;, it appears unlikely that the moderates will support the Congress policy of remaining under the present constitution.Another event of some interest has been the publication of the correspondence which has passed between Mr. Gandhi and His Excellency on the question of his visit to the Frontier.    The object of the visit  is &quot;to be with &quot;the jbeople of the province, knowing them at first hand,  and &quot;to understand how far the teaching of non-violence by Khan &quot;Sahib Abdul Ghaffar Khan has permeated his followers.&quot;    In reply Mr. Gandhi has been informed that His Excellency con-siders such a visit undesirable and that this  decision is based on a consideration of the evexits of recent years and present conditions.    Whatever maybe Mr. Gandhi&apos;s motives, a visit to this inflammable area might have very serious
results, even though the movement is quiescent inconsequence of the action taken against Red-Shirts and the banwhich is imposed on this organisation.      An enquiry onthe lines proposed would also be interpreted as an enquiry into the policy adopted by Government in dealing withthe movement.
