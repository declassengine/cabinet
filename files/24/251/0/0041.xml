SjjOjTUMjjNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAIN IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-J2 R E T. M copy NO..  256 (54).CABINET.THE SPEAKER&apos;S SEAT.MemorandAvm by the Prime Minister.1. The Cabinet ie fully aware of the relation of whoeverhollo the office of Speaker and the political Parties. Hitherto Parties, by the exercise of self restraint, have left the Speaker in possession of his seat without a contest at elections - the only exception being when Mr. Gully was appointed Speaker at the very end of a Parliament, when party feeling ran high and when the Opposition felt that the Government nominee was purely partisan and that it itself nominated one who was most clearly marked out to fill the position.2. Por some time the Labour Party has been threatening to oppose the present Speaker when an election comes.      That decision has now been sanctioned by the Labour Party National caucus, and the Leader of the Party in the House of Commons has intimated to the Speaker that he is unable to take any action since the caucus has come to its decision.      The Labour candidature is being pursued in the constituency, and the Speaker cannot assume that when the election comes his opponent will be withdrawn and he will retain his seat without entering the Party fight.3. The Cabinet must consider this situation:(a) Are we to allow the understanding so essential to keeping the Speaker of the House of Commons out of politics to be departed from without any attempt to secure its beneficial results?     OR(b) pare we prepared to take some step which will have the effect of maintaining the independence
of the Speaker so soon as he is elected to his office and so long as it is the wish of the House of Commons to retain him in that office?4. I would urge the Cabinet to take steps in the matter.I should propose that legislation be prepared providing that:(a) The Speaker of the House of Commons shall occupy a position all by himself and be simply the Speaker of the House whilst retaining the status and privileges now enjoyed by him as Speaker;(b) He will vacate his seat on election to the Speakership and a by-election will in consequence follow to fill the vacancy;(c) On dissolution of a Parliament he will continue to fulfil the duties which the Speaker now performs on that event.5. If on dissolution he chooses to return to party politics and fight a seat, he shall not be eligible for re-election as Speaker;    if he chooses to remain as Speaker, he will be eligible as though he were an elected Member of the House to be chosen as Speaker by the new Parliament.6. If during the life of a Parliament he resigns his office or were to die, the election of his successor as Speaker would proceed as provided for above.7. A suggestion has been made that a special constituencyperhaps named St. Stephens, should be created which would be used to allow a procedure something as above to be adopted.I do not like this;    it is cumbersome;    it strikes me as being &quot;strained&quot;;    the plan I propose is simple,
straightforward, and gives the Speai-cership a place and a dignity specially marked out in the Constitution of Parliament to which it is fully entitled -- not a fraudulent constituency hut a status for the office itself,8. I would, therefore, recommend the Cabinet to accept this proposal and to allow me to put this memorandum in the hands of draftsmen who will prepare the necessary Bill.(Intd.) J. R. M.10, Downing Street, S. W.; 1, 22nd November,  1954.Hi..........-
