(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT),Sjji C R S T. n.P.  291 (54)aCABINET.NAVY ESTIMATES 19.35.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.-  The Cabinet decided on 31st July, 1934,  that both the Naval Construction Programme and the Naval Deficiency Programme should be considered by the Pirst Lord and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the early Autumn and the results reported to the Cabinet,2. This paper deals with the Navy Estimates,  1935,which include the provision for making good naval deficiencies in 1935.      A separate paper is being circulated by the Pirst Lord dealing with the Naval Construction Programme,  1935.      As will be seen from that paper,  this programme does not materially affect  the 1935 . Estimates since the greater part of the cost falls to be met in 1936 and 1937.3. At the request of the Chancellor,  the Pirst Lordhas agreed to reduce by  750,000 the total Estimate which he originally proposed for 1935.4. In effecting this reduction,  it has been necessary to cut by over  350,000 the provision included for making   good deficiencies, and this cut will of course either retard the rate at which deficiencies can be made good,  or have to be retrieved in 1936 and following years by increasing the provision which would otherwise have been proposed. 5. A further reduction of  250,000 has been   effected by increasing from  1,000,000 to  1,250,000 the overheadCOPY NO.
cut applied to allow for anticipated underspending on contract work, etc.      This reduction has &quot;been effected on the understanding, proposed by the Chancellor,  that if during the course of the financial year it becomes evident that the increase in the overhead cut has not been justifi by the progress of work on the approved programme the Chancellor will agree to a Supplementary Ss legitimate being presented to make good the difference, 6.      -  The revised total Estimate agreed between the First Lord and the Chancellor is  60,050,000.,(Intldo )      N.C.
