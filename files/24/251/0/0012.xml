JS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .E COT. Copy No........ &quot; CABINET..P.237(34)STABILISATION OP EASTER. Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary .1. I desire to call the attention of my colleagues tothe position which has arisen under the Easter Act,   1928.2. Under this Act it is provided that Easter Day isto he the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April. The Act, however,  is not to come into operation until a date to he fixed \)y Order-in-Council, and a draft of the Order-in-Council must first he laid before and approved by both Houses of Parliament.      The Act further provides that before making any such draft Order, regard shall be had to any opinion officially expressed by any Church or other Christian body.3. The passing of the Act was the culmination of a movement which began about 1910 for the stabilising of Easter Day,  for the convenience mainly of the  commercial community. The Bill was introduced by a Private Member and was left by the Government of the day to a free vote of the House on Second Reading.      It is clear from the debate, not only from the speech of the then Home Secretary but also from the speeches of the supporters of the Bill,   that it was not seriously contemplated by anyone that the Act would be brought into operation unless and until the general agreement of,  at any rate,  all the Christian Churches of Western Europe had been obtained.4. After the passing of the Act steps were taken toobtain the views of all the Churches in the United Kingdom,
and the Holy See was also approached through the diplomatic channel.      The Church of England favoured the stabilisation of Easter provided there is general ecclesiastical agreement -especially agreement of the Roman Church.     The other Protestant Churches in England, Wales and Northern Ireland expressed themselves in favour of the change,  and the Churches of Scotland either supported the proposal or were indifferent to it.     The Holy See, however, was opposed to the proposal and stated that &quot;should the law mentioned in His Majesty&apos;s Minister&apos;s note be promulgated,  the Holy Rather would be bound to enter a solemn protest and declare the decision of Parliament outside of and contrary to Catholic tradition.      The said law could only have the effect of establishing a new Easter,  the Anglican Easter, differing as much from the Easter of the dissident Orientals as from the Catholic Easter&quot; .5.      The next step taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government was to ascertain the views of the European Governments  (other than Turkey and the U.S.S.R.)  partly because it was obviously desirable,  though by no means essential, that any change should be made uniform,  at any rate over Western Europe,  but mainly because it was hoped that,  if general agreement could be obtained among secular authorities as to the desirability of stabilisation,  the Vatican might  change its mind.      The replies of the Governments were, however,  not helpful, being for the most part either non-committal or to the effect that they would be guided in a matter of this kind by the opinion of the religious authorities.6 .      This was the position in 1930 when the question, together with other cognate questions, was placed on the Agenda of the Fourth General Transit and Communications Conference of the League of Nations  fixed for 1931, and it
was decided to await the results of this Conference before considering any further action.7 .      The Conference in due course adopted a declaration in favour of the stabilisation of Easter and expressed the hope that the religious authorities would consider in the most favourable spirit what action they might take.     This was brought to the notice of the religious bodies by the Council of the League and the result has now been communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government.      There is no substantial change in the position.     The general attitude of the Protestant Churches appears to be to assent to the proposed change provided it meets with general approval, but the Holy See remains adamant, maintaining the point of view that the stabilisation of Easter is a pre-eminently religious question, which falls within the competence of the Holy See, and that for reasons of higher spiritual concern the Holy See cannot contemplate a change in this matter.8.      The matter is from time to time raised in Parliament, both in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons,  and recent Questions have been answered by referring to the enquiries which were being made under the auspices of the League of Nations, but it will now be necessary for the Government to decide whether or not it is intended to take any further action with a view to bringing the Act of 1928 into operation.      The position,  as it appears to me,  is that the conditions which Parliament  contemplated should exist before the bringing of the Act into operation do not in fact yet exist, although successive Governments have done all that could be reasonably expected to create such conditions.      It is true that non-religious opinion in the country is probably unanimously in favour of the stabilisation
of Easter in so far as it is not indifferent, but it does not appear to me that there is sufficient advantage to be gained by the change to outweigh the disadvantage of flouting the opinion not only of the Vatican but also of the Church of England.9.     In these circumstances I have no hesitation in asking the Cabinet to agree that no further action shall be taken at the present time to bring into operation the Easter Act, 1928, and that I should be authorised to announce that the Government have so decided,  if and when the matter is raised again in Parliament.J .
