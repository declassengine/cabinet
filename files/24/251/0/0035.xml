Suggested lines for House of Commons. Introducti on.1. The greatest need of the world is peace.Time opportune for general review of where we stand. We have worked steadfastly for Disarmament as the surest guarantee of peace.A sketch of the Disarmament Conference, the ideals that inspired ic, the practical proposals we made, the difficulties it has encountered.But the ideals stand.And the principal purpose of us all must always and constantly be peace.      The world to-day stands uneasy and disturbed.    While peace is the desire,  passionately held, of all that is best iii ail countries,  it is impossible not to recognise that there are forces at work, which whether they intend it or&quot; not are leading the world into paths full of peril to the world&apos;s security and well being.Therefore forces of peace must not be divided.S. Limited objectives which do not secure disarmamentare no substitute for it, and we must be careful that we do nothing to prejudice tho attainment of the main object or to minimise its importance.3. Consistently with this we are anxious to work for specific objects which are more capable of early attainment, &quot;bringing each is sue and every proposal to the single and crucial teat of whether it can be made to subserve the cause of peace.      Much useful work may be done by such a method of approach and the aggregate results should bring
&apos;   188us nearer to our main objective.     The Washington Treaty, the most valuable limitation of armaments   hitherto attained, was itself the result of a series of separate agreements.What are the objects on which we can now profitably concentrat e.4. First and foremost there is effective control ofthe trade in arms.      We already exercise a thorough control in this country.    We think it is vital that we should obtain an international convention by which all countries which export arms should exercise an agreed and common system of control.      Such a convention should include the following provisions :-(l) ho trade in arms should be permitted except by a Government licence.(2) No sales of arms should be made except to a Government or its authorised agent.(3) No Government should. givS, either directly or indirectly,  any subsidy or financial assistance by way of export credit or otherwise for any contract for the supply of arms to a foreign country.All these represent the existing practice of the United Kingdom.5. We further regard it as essential that theConvention should provide the speedy means of securing international agreement by which an effective embargo could be placed by all countries on the export of arms at times and in circumstances where the peace of the world requires that such an embargo should be imposed.-a-
Here again the British practice enables us to give Immediate effect to any such decision.    (Give the    account of our initiative to secure an embargo in the case of Bolivia and Paraguay and point out delays caused due to inability of other countries to use prompt action.)We shall do our best to secure sn international convention containing all these essential provisions. This goes in some respects further than the Geneva articles;    but a Convention to be  effective must deal with all these points.6. In the second place we consider that there shouldbe effective national control of trie manufacture of t rms by all countries on agreed lines;    such control should provide that no private manufacture of arms should be undertaken by firms which are not in receipt of a Government licence.    The Geneva articles deal with this.7.      Thirdly9  there should be reasonable publicity with regard  to both the manufacture and export of arms. The world is afraid or suspicious of the unknown.    fe, in this country,  have always made a complete disclosure in our Parliamentary estimates of our expenditure on our Defence Cervices.    No one will suggest that any country should be forced to give away secrets of design or manufactures    nor would anyone suggest that vast detailed returns should be made which are not really useful for the purpose.    What is required and what we shall strive to obtain is fair and reasonable publicity of programmes and manufacture and export.
(8. If the Draft Geneva Articles are examined, it will he realised that they would require to he put into a different form if a self-contained protocol is to be drawn up in place cf draft articles which are designed only to form part of a General Convention dealing with every aspect of disarmament. We are prepared to co-cperate in this necessary reformation cf the articles, it being clearly understood, that we do so in accordance with the president&apos;s suggestion, and bearing always in mind that specific protocols on limited subjects are no substitute for the Disarmament Convention which we all desire to secure.9. As regards export, we already have a system of licensing in this country which^enables us/to make regular returns of all material exported.10.       As regards manufacturethe proposal of the Geneva Articles that returns should be made of each order within so many days of its receipt would, impose an intolerable burden both upon manufacturing firms and not less upon the Secretariat of Geneva without mailing any useful contribution to the purpose we have, in view.      Y,e should be prepared to make regular and periodical returns of manufactures in whatever form might secure the maximum publicity that was consistent with the indispensable needs of national security. The precise form that might on this principle be adopted would seem a proper matter for detailed examination at Geneva.The words in brackets have been suggested as an alternative to the words in the margin.ffers the dlest lblicity id we are :us in a mition
In this connection we shall also have to settle in a practical way what types of manufacture we want to cover.      Clearly we want to cover all munitions of war.      Equally clearly no useful purpose would, he served by attempting to take account of every variety of article normally used for peaceful purposes but which might conceivably find its way into some implement of war.11. Lastly,  if a Convention covering all these questionscan be obtained, the peoples of the world will wish to be sure that the agreement is being kept.        The particular articles which were drafted at Geneva were designed as an essential part of a Disarmament Convention which would limit both the number and the types of armaments.      For such a Convention it was felt that an adequate system of supervision would be required and we have already stated that If a Disarmament Convention can be obtained we would accept such supervision. But,  if all that we can obtain at present is a limited Convention on the lines I have indicated,  the raison d&apos;&quot;etre of such supervision seems to us to disappear.      -t is not then a question of seeing that a country has not produced numbers or types of weapons contrary to the Convention:    it is a question of whether the country has made true returns as a record of the facts.      Moreover, an attempt to erect a system of automatic supervision for the purpose of ascertaining whether in fact the returns of manufactures produced by many thousands of industrial firms were accurate would not be practicable or useful.      In our view the security that returns of manufactures were accurately made must be the good faith as it must be the responsibility of national governments..      We assume however,  that consequent upon the Convention some
international body would be established to receive,  collate and publish returns end to supervise the working of the Convention.      If it were alleged on responsible authority that any country was falling to carry out the Convention we conceive that it would be for that international tribunal to consider the charge;    and for our part,  if the tribunal considered that there was a rrlma facie case of breach to be answered, we should welcome the.opportunity of proving on the spot the truth or falsity of that charge.12, It stands to reason that if we are  to achieveeither the wider purpose of disarmament or more limited agreements of the kind we are now contemple ting,  the adherence of all the principal manufacturing countries of the world is essential.
