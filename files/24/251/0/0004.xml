THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1934.SECEET. Copy bo.CP. 229 (34).CABINET.EGYPT.1. TELEGRAMS Nos. 272, 273 and 275 just received from Mr. Peterson at Cairo raise an urgent point of major policy on which I must consult the Cabinet.2. It will be remembered that on the 25th September the Cabinet had before them my memorandum CP. 215 (34), which discussed the situation which would arise if King Fuad died. The general lines of policy indicated in my paper were approved.3. These lines of policy, however, assumed that upon King Fuad&apos;s death it would be possible for us, by the exercise of suitable influence, to &apos;&apos; secure a Regency and/or Cabinet acceptable both to Egypt and to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment,&quot; and that in order to do so it might be necessary to secure the immediate adjournment of the Egyptian Parliament after the reading of the King&apos;s nominees for the Regency.&quot; Mr. Peterson has now expressed considerable doubt whether these desiderata could be secured after the King&apos;s death by action on our part, and this has led him more and to favour the exercise of our influence to secure corresponding ends before the King actually dies.4. The next thing that happened appeared to offer precisely the opportunity that was needed. The present Prime Minister, Abdul Fettah Yehia, on his own initiative, raised with Mr. Peterson questions arising out of the possible death of King Fuad, and insisted that the impending situation was one which would involve the joint responsibility of Britain and Egypt. In effect, therefore, the Egyptian Prime Minister was asking for our advice, and Mr. Peterson, in response to this request for co-operation, urged that what was most needed was to remove from their present position of influence the men who are chiefly responsible for the discredit into which the Egyptian Government has fallen, of whom the chief are Ibrashi, who holds the position of &quot; Controller &quot; at the Palace, and contractor politicians, like Abboud. This would involve also the removal of two members from the present Ministry, the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Communications, who are mere creatures of Ibrashi. There can be no question that this was good advice, and if it could be followed during the King&apos;s lifetime would improve the chances of a decent Government after his death.5. The Egyptian Prime Minister has rejected Mr. Peterson&apos;s advice and betrayed his confidence. Not only has he failed to take the action recommended, but he has told Ibrashi and Co., and is endeavouring to create the impression that an attempt is being made to tamper with Egyptian rights of self-government. This, of course, is quite untrue, as Mr. Petersoifs recommendations were made in response to a request for his advice.   I think it would be well to make this known.6. Mr&apos;. Peterson, however, in the telegrams above quoted, wishes to go further and to take advantage of the somewhat improved health of King Fuad to seek a personal interview with the King and there and then to recommend to him the course which he previously unsuccessfully recommended to his Prime Minister. Mr. Peterson feels, with good reason, that King Fuad is not likely to have received a correct impression through the channels hitherto available for informing&apos; him,   viz.,   Ibrashi  and  the  Prime  Minister  himself.    Indeed,[10680]
Foreign Office, October 22, 1934.Mr. Peterson has information that the King is being told that we are seeking to secure the immediate nomination of Prince Mohammed Ali, the King&apos;s nephew, as sole Regent, which is not true. Accordingly, Mr. Peterson, in his telegram No. 275, wishes to go to the length of asking King Fuad, on the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to summon a new Ministry and to make Tewfik Nessim Pasha (a former Prime Minister and one of the elder statesmen) head of the Government.7. I entertain the gravest doubt whether the course recommended to us by the Acting High Commissioner should be followed in the present circumstances, but as I shall be departing from his advice if I give him different instructions, I feel that I must consult my Cabinet colleagues. The difficulties which I feel in the course proposed may be summarised as follows : In the first place, King Fuad is ill. He is understood to be suffering from a complication of diseases, and to be alternately in a melancholy and an excitable condition. What would happen if, after tendering this advice to King Fuad, he refused to take it ? It seems to me that we might find that we had fomented an anti-British outcry in Egypt at a most unfortunate moment. We may assume that Ibrashi will fight for his own hand, and the cry that we are insisting upon imposing on Egypt a ministry of our choice (which we last did in the time of Lord Lloyd) will be very easy to raise. There is a danger that the policy which the Cabinet approved on the 25th September would be so unduly rushed that when the proper time comes to take up a strong position, we shall have exhausted our credit and consolidated opposition against us. I am not sorry that it is known in Egypt that we advised Ibrashi&apos;s suppression, though I think it would be just as well if it was publicly known that we offered such advice in reply to the Prime Ministers request for it. But tendering advice to the King to get rid of his present Ministry without any certainty that the advice would be accepted seems to me a very dangerous course. I have provisionally telegraphed urgently to Mr. Peterson asking what assurance he could offer that such advice would be accepted and carried through without serious trouble.8. My advice therefore is that we should let it be known that Mr. Peterson&apos;s recent advice was tendered in response to the Prime Ministers request, but that when Mr. Peterson gets his audience with the King he should not press for changes which he is not certain to get. The medical estimate is, I understand, that King Fuad is not likely to live for more than a couple of months. When he dies it is more than probable that the Regency which he will be found to have nominated will be wholly unsatisfactory. If, as a result, there is grave dissatisfaction in Egypt and every indication that confusion and disorder will result, then we may be able to intervene with effect and more general acceptance. But, however wise our own judgment may be and however shrewd our recommendations, if we try to force them on Egypt at the present moment it seems to me that the result will be to make the effectiveness of our own action hereafter much less certain.J.
