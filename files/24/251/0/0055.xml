^pnrxtint is tim! property o&apos;f-his britannic majesty1 s government).E C BJ8L2- l/^A ---- Copy No.__f i-p. 280(34).cae i n e t. afghanistan.Memorandum fey , the, Secretary ,of.,State for .India.In connection with the conclusions reached on 14th March 1934, in regard to Afghanistan (Cabinet 9 (34)), I circulate for the information of my colleague? the following brief summary of recent developments, bearing on the policy of the Afghan C-overnment towards this country and towards Russia, in case it may be of interest.2. It will be remembered that the Afghan Government had made a reeuest for consultation with the British General Staff in connection with the defence of the new road from Kabul tc northern Afghanistan.   His Majesty&apos;s Minister was instructed to have a friendly talk with the Afghan Prime Minister, in-order to ascertain whether this request appeared to indicate dissatisfaction with our previous declarations of policy and to be designed to draw us into a specifid military commitment. On 21st April Sir r. Maconachie had a most satisfactory interview with Muhammad Hashim. This interview wade it clear that in suggesting military consultation the Afghan Government had in mind only the defence of the Northern road with their own resources^ that they are satisfied with our past assurances, and that there is no danger of their adopting a pro-Russian policy or entering into any unwise commitment to Russia.   Muhammad Hashim stated that his policy, which would be adhered to so long as he was alive, is the same as that of the late King Nadir, namely, sincere friendship and co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, although the fact should never be advertised, and might sometimes have to be camouflaged/
3. From statements made by the Afghan Foreign Minister and Prime Minister at later interviews on %th and 6th September, it appears that for some time past the Soviet legation has given up its hectoring attitude.   It no longer presses unacceptable demands and proposals. The suggestion that the northern road might be joined up with the Russian railway system (out of which the Afghan request for consultation with our General Staff arose) has not been repeated, and the Afghan Minister has stated that it may now be regarded as having been abandoned.4. On 21st April Sir R. Maconachie made the offer of military consultation on the defence of the northern road. But, as a result, no doubt, partly of the change in the Soviet attitude, the Afghan Government appear to be in no hurry for this to take place. A suggestion was made that British advisers might visit the road when a new alignment, now under construction, has been completed, Subsequently a programme was tentatively agreed upon by the Government of India and Sir R. Maconachie for such a visit and for subse uent technical discussions in India between the Indian General Staff and Afghan officers deputed for the purpose. The Afghan Government, however, have not reverted to the matter. The position therefore is that we have offered to comply with their request for military consultation regarding the defence of the  road, &amp;nd in doing so have reassured thorn of the friendly and sympathetic attitude of His Majesty!s Government, while the Afghan Government, on their side, are satisfied with our assurances.    In these circumstances, the Government of India and Sir R. Maconachie agreed thai it would be a mistake to do more than we have done bo press our offer on the Afghan Govern-Hient, and it v/as decided, on their recommendation, to leave thematter
32B3.matter in abeyance until the Afghan Government bring it forward again.    I should, however, add that Colonel Grasett who has just relinquished the appointment of Deputy Director of Intelligence on the Indian General Staff was enabled to visit the northern road during a recent stay at the Kabul Legation.   He has written a most interesting and valuable report on this and also on the roads from India to Kabul and Kandahar.5. The important Question of the improvement of theroads into Afghanistan from the Indian frontier has been taken up in the course of the conversations which have already takenplace. At the interview on 21st April, Sir R. Maconachiereminded the Afghan Prime Minister of the assurances previouslygiven to the Afghan Government, and pointed out to him that military assistance could not, even if other conditions were favourable, be given on an adequate scale or with the speedwhich might be desirable, unless the road between Torkhamand. Kabul were improved.   Muhammad Has him replied that the roadwas being improved as rapidly as the Afghan Government could afford, and enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared to grant financial assistance,   at the same time he made it clear that such assistance, however welcome itwould be, could only be accepted if it were kept absolutelysecret.    On receiving this report, I urged the   Government ofIndia to consider a contribution in money or kind towards theimprovement of the roads in south-eastern Afghanistan, subject toits being possible (as desired by the Afghan. Prime Minister) toavoid publicity in regard to any expenditure of this nature.The Government of India have this question under consideration.f contribution to the Afghan Government for this purpose hasmuch to recommend it, but the condition of secrecy imposed bythe Afghan Prime Minister obviously creates a great difficulty.6. With reference to the Afghan Government&apos;request
4.request for purchase of munitions, Muhammad Hashim was asked t- specify their requirements and the terms of payment proposed.   He promised to discuss this matter further, but tho Afghan Government are still not ready for such discussion, because throughout this year they have been considering, but have not yet decided, the method of re-arming their forces (e.g. whether, and to what extent, with &quot;303 rifles) and the s urces of supply. Sir R. Maconachie has pointed out to them the a &quot;vantage of maintaining the *303 standard, in case of an emergency (i.e. a war with Russia), and has informed them that wc have large stocks in this country which could be sold at a reasonable price.   He considers, and the Government of India agree, that until they have reached a decision on the general question of the re-armament of their forces (as to which he thinks their acute financial stringency may be a delaying factor), it would be a mistake to press them further.7. The important results of the conversations which have taken place this year are that, by our readiness to comply with the Afghan Government&apos;s requests for munitions and military consultation, we have shown our sympathy with them in their difficulties;   we have reassured them as to our friendly attitude by reminding them of the declarations of policy already made;    it has been made clear that they are satisfied&quot;with these declarations, and do not expect or require s specific promise of military support;   we have received, an assurance that the policy of the Afghan Government continues to be one of sincere friendship and co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it is clear that there is no present danger of their adopting a pro-Russian policy or entering into any unwise commitment to Russia as a result either of Soviet threats or cajolery.8. In accordance with paragraph (el) of the cabinet conclusions of 14th March last, I took up with the Departmentsconcerned the form of a statement to be made to the Afahan-Govcrnmoi
government if, contrary to present indications, a further statement of our intentions should become necessary. Agreement has been reached on the form of statement attached, in which the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul have also demi-officially signified their concurrence.9, A recent event of some interest has been the entry of Afghanistan into the League of Nations, The Afghan Government had been considering this step for some years past, and had asked our advice. We had let them know that we favoured Afghanistan&apos;s entry into the League, as we considered that her position would be strengthened thereby.    We know that the Afghan decision was taken after consultation with Turkey, and it is clear that it was not the outcome of any suggestion by the Soviet Government.       In a sense it was occasioned by thc entry of the Soviet Union, because, so long as Russia remained outside the League while Great Britain was within it, the Afghan Government feared that accession by Afghanistan would be regarded as evidence that she was unduly under our influence and opposed to Russia.    In this way therefore the adhesion of Russia to the League removed the last obstacle to Afghanisfan&apos;s own entry.S.H.30th November 1934.
Suggestgd-fprm of statement to be made to. the Afghan (joyernment ifj contrary to present indications,,.a further: statement &quot;of our intentions slioulo. oecomo necessary.&quot;We presume that an open treaty or engagement, hov/ever much we might desire it, is out of the question because of the ill effect that this would have in Afghanistan itself.&quot;   On the other hand, we cannot enter into a secret engagement, because of Article IB of the Covenant.   But we are prepared to make the following confidential statement of our present policy, recognising, as we do, that the preservation of a strong and independent Afghanistan - so long as it is friendly - is essential to British no less than to Afghan interests.    If you should be the victim of serious and unprovoked aggression by Russia, and should, ask us to help, wo should, if other means failed, give you military support.    The exact form which sush assistance would take must depend on the cifcumstances that existed at the time, and must in any case be a matter for discussion between us.   But it is certain that we could not come to your assistance as quickly or as effectively as the eventuality would undoubtedly demand unless the communications between India and Afghanistan were radically improved.&quot;A caveat would be added against the adoption of an aggressive, provocative or incautious attitude towards Russia.
