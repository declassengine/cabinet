^DOCUME^.P.274(34)rnncTCOPY MO.   cabinet.INDIA.Position resulting from the, Publication of the Reoort of the Joint Select Committee.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India,I circulate for the information of my colleagues tv/o telegrams which I have just received from the Viceroy. These telegrams are relevant to the considerations which I wish to bring before the Cabinet at our meeting on Wednesday, Item 8 on the Aerenda.S.H.26th.No november 1934.Telegram from Viceroy. 2^rd November 19VkFinal results of Legislative Assembly elections are not yet available, but of 94 reported results, Congress have won 41 seats;   Nationalists 6;   Muslim Nationalists 3;   Sikhs 2; and others 42.   But there are certain points which will, I hope, prove helpful to you in combating Die-hards&apos; views. These views are supported by such reports as I have received from Local Governments.(a) General public in the Provinces, especially in the rural areas, take little interest in the work of the Assemblyj    in so far as they take interest in political questions, they are more interested in questions dealt with by-Provincial Councils, e.g. administration of transferred subjects, law and order, questions in Provinces or legislation dealing with local problems, such as tenancies, rural indebtedness, etc.(b)
(b) In consequence of this, persons of local influence ?.re reluctant to seek election for the Assembly for (1) owing to unwieldy size of all constituencies and absence of any organised party to support them, very heavy personal expenditure is involved. The vast areas covered by existing constituencies is perhaps not fully realised generally, though description is given in Volume I of Simon Report, and point has been fully appreciated by Joint parliamentary Committee;    (2) work as a member of the Assembly nedessitates long absence from his home district and does not add materially to his local prestige or his influence with his Loc a1 Go v e rnment.(c) Congress is the only organised all-India political party and is able to carry on an intensive political campaign owing to its funds, its influence over a large section ofthe press and the large number available to carry out canvassing. All Local Governments stress point that success of Congtess candidates is largely due to superior organisation.(4)   At last general election Congress boycotted election entirely. There was a very small percentage of contested elections (39 out of 104-) . Successful candidates represented no political party, were in many cases men of small local influence and have not increased that influence by work in the Assembly, whether in opposition or support of Government. During lifetime of the Assembly they have lost touch with their constituencies and no party organisation is available to nurse their constituencies in their absence. Congress candidates, on the other hand, by their civil disobedience activities or otherwise, have kept themselves in the public eye and some are probably, apart from these activities, men of considerable local influence. Thus, North-West Frontier regard election of Dr. Khan Sahib as partly due to his personal popularity, especially in Peshawar,and
and success of a Congress candidate in As is ait! was also attributed partly to fact that sitting member was of lower caste.(e) It is, cf course, contended that election was fought on straight issue of reforms proposals, even though Congress put forward no alternative proposals, but it would be more correct to say that Congress candidates merely indulged in destructive criticism and abuse of the Government. The converse of Congress picture was never put before the electorates and, indeed, this cannot be done under present conditions, for the Government and its officers are bound to adopt an attitude of strict neutrality and cannot take any part in the elections. The sitting member, under handicaps which I have already mentioned, cannot show that he has done anything   substantial for his constituents, and the fate of those who have habitually opposed the Government and who differ but little from their Congress successors, has been the same as of those who have supported the Government. The ordinary elector, knowing little of all-India political questions, is influenced by sentimental considerations, sympathises with a candidate who is &quot;Agin the Government&quot; and who has perhaps suffered for his opinions, and hopes, ill a vague sort of way, that support of a Congress candidate or a change of his (^representative) may do him some good and, in any case, can do him no harm. Those with any stake in the country are apathetic, as they feel that in present conditions, if&apos;their vested interests are attacked, they will be protected by the Government. This accounts, I think, for the apathy of the landholders in the United Provinces and for their failure to organise.   The Chief Secretary to the Government of the United Provinces reports that owing to apathy and private quarrels landholders started their campaign too late, that several candidates   had inadequate financial resources
resources and gotlittle or no support from their friends or party organisation j owiny to private quarrels , landholders in some cases worked ageinst candidates standing in their own interest. That landholders are beginning to have some glimmering of responsibility is shown by the success of anti-Congress candidates in landholders&apos; special constituencies in the United Provinces, Madras, Bihar and Bengal.   My inference from this is that we cannot have real elections that will genuinely reflect opinion in the country till the electorate realises that results may clearly affect their personal interests, or, in other words, till we get responsibility.(f) The attitude which Congress members will adopt in the Assembly is uncertain. I trust that association with the Government will tone them down as has happened, in the past and that they will not adopt policy of pure obstruction. Adoption of constitutional methods is greatly preferable to boycotting and civil disobedience even though it may have embarrassing results on Government legislation and financial measures.(g) The defeat of the Justice Party in Madras is, I admit, disappointing and unexpected. The early announcement of the defeat of Mudaliyar and Chetty probably affected results both in other constituencies in Madras and elsewhere in India.    Local Government attributes success of Congress to superior organisation, division in the Justice Party ranks, weakness of some candidates and indifference of electors. Patro, I see in recent speech, attributes failure of the Justice Party to its lethargy and over-confidence and to growing indifference and discontent in the rank and file which were unheeded by the leaders.   He added &quot;country was politically apathetic and voters wished to give new-comers a chance&quot;. There is probably a good deal in this.   Justice Party is also more concerned with local.problems and politics than questions dealt with by the Assembly.telegram
5-   301Telegram from Viceroy, 25th November 19VkRecent developments have not, in my opinion, made any material change in the situation, and are not such as to justify any reconsideration of our general policy. They emphasise the necessity of carrying out that policy to its conclusion without any avoidable delay.2. I have already communicated my opinion on the elections. They were, and they must be, under present conditions, unreal. Though it is not desirable to under-estimate the influence of Congress, I do not think that Congress would have achieved this success in a provincial election.A recent report from Madras says that &quot;the swing of electors to Congress Party in Assembly elections is not necessarily an index of what will hapoen in the next provincial elections.    It is sgnificant^recent Local Board and Municipal elections, Justice Party candidates have definitely fared better than Congress candidates&quot;.    I hope too that the result of these elections may have brought home to our supporters the need for organisation.3. The success of the Congress Party is I admit greater than I at one time anticipated and we shall no doubt be confronted with a strong and well organised opposition in the next Assembly which may prove embarrassing.We shall have the support of the European members and I trust also of a very large percentage of Muslims which, with the nominated members, may help us to carry out crucial divisions, but even if it does not, there is no ground for dismay for   his reason.   In the first session there will be little, if any, controversial legislation or legislation involving new taxation.   Though possibly some parts of the Budget may be rejected, we have constitutional remedy and I shall not hesitate to employ it when necessary.    If this situation arises and if the Assembly becomes as suggestedby
by the Committee in paragraph 41 of their Report &quot;a debating society adhereing to an executive&quot;, it will add force to the criticism of the Committee and provide a strong argument for expediting introduction of the reforms.4. As regards reception of the Report it is, of course,true that all shades of opinion have expressed disappointment in various degrees but this is just what happened on publication of other similar reports in tho past. The extreme Nationalist papers have counselled &quot;rejection&quot;, but I doubt whether they mean by this, as suggested in the &apos;Statesman1 recently, anything more than a resolution stigmatising the reforms as unworthy and unacceptable. Sapru has also pointed out that though Congress with its renewed strength in the Assembly may move for rejection, yet rejection would not necessarily imply boycott as Congress now profess constitutional methods.Practically no responsible opinion from any quarter appears to be in favour of refusing to work the reforms. Congress have, it is true, not yet announced their viows, but the Working Committee and the Parliamentary Board, will meet early in December. There is also a move by the leaders of more moderate and liberal views tc call an All-Parties Conference after the Congress meeting, and there are signs that Congress will be asked to participate.    If this plan matures, it may mean a combination of the parties seeking modification of the Committee&apos;s proposals but, even if Congress decide on refusal to co-operate, I doubt whether it will affect the other shades of opinion. Congress will be up against the di difficulties of communal decision.p. is regards European opinion, we have reason to believe that this will not be unfavourable and will not lend support to Die-hard views.   You possibly saw a. Router&apos; s telegram from Calcutta stating that publication of summaries caused rise in Indian Government securities in Calcutta market.6.
3037.6.. wre have informed you of our views of Gandhi&apos;s new programme. The danger is potential but not yet real and the best means of countering it will be to push on the reforms before he has time to create a new organisation.7&quot; My considered opinion is the t there is not the least cause for alarm or pessimism. Everyone here is &quot;reforms weary&quot; and I feel sure that a healthier atmosphere-will be created once these discussions are completed.   If there arc any indications of hesitation or delay on tho pert of His Majesty&apos;s Government;, that might make position far more embarrassing, but present developments, as far as they are apparent to us, do not cause us at this end any dismay.
