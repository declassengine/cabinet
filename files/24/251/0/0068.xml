This dooument is toe property of His Britannic- Majesty&apos;s government copy No.   ...CABINET.Abolition of Land Purchase Commission, Northern Ireland.Memorandum by the Home secretary the process of transferring tenanted land in Northern Ireland from landlord to tenant, under a series of Acts extending from 1870 to 1929, is now almost completed and tne time is rapidly approaching when it wilL be no longer necessary, or indeed justifiable, to retain any special machinery; and provision ought accordingly to be made as soon as possible for enabling the Land Purchase Commission to be abolished.   Certain detailed work will remain to be done for a considerable time, but this can be done equally efficiently and more economically by the ordinary administrative and judicial departments In the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.     Moreover until legislation is passed it is impossible to prevent applications being made in respect of cases which ought to have been brought to notice long ago, involving the continuance of the Commission for on indefinite period.For the abolition of the Land Purchase Commission and the transfer of its functions to otner Departments an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament will be necessary, and a Bill for this purpose was included by tho Cabinet, in framing the legislative programme for the 1934-35 Session, among the important Bills to be introduced only if time permits Cabinet 36 (34) Conclusion 12).SECRET. CP. 293(34)
7th December,  1934.an unnecessary Department to bo abolished and an appreciable saving,  that will accrue to Northern Ireland,  to be effected. It therefore seems desirable to have a Bill ready in order that it may be introduced as soon as opportunity offers.A Bill has been prepared, in consultation with the Treasury and the Government of Northern Ireland, and is ready, if the Cabinet agree,  for submission to the Home Affairs Committee.      The Bill is,  owing to its subject matter,  somewhat complicated, but it raises no controversial questions and is indeed: almost wholly concerned v/ith administrative details.        I am advised that it could not properly be introduced in the House of Lords.I ask for authority to submit the draft Bill to the Home Affairs Committee.J .G.
