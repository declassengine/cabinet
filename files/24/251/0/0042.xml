Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1934.SECRET. Copy No.   42CP. 267 (34)CABINET.HERRING INDUSTRY.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and.the Home Secretary.OUR colleagues are already aware of the serious plight of the herring industry. They will recall that, as a measure of temporary relief, certain Exchequer assistance was made available earlier in the year, and that the Sea-fish Commission were specially asked to enquire into the conditions of the industry and to report upon it as a matter of urgency.2. The Commission^ Report was published about the middle of August and has aroused widespread interest. Its outstanding recommendation is the establishment of a Herring Board, nominated by the Government, with wide powers of control and regulation of the industry, including the power to license the boats and the curers, fishsalesmen and others engaged in the industry. In the exercise of these powers it is contemplated, inter alia, that there should be a compulsory cutting down of the herring fleet, and possibly some amalgamation of cuiers. Furthermore, the Report made recommendations on finance which have been discussed with the Chancellor, with the results set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 of this memorandum.3. We had a meeting on the 25th October with representatives of the fisher-men and all the other interests (26 in number) engaged in the industry. There was a unanimous feeling (with the exception of a slight reservation on behalf of the Clyde fishermen) in favour of the establishment of the proposed Board endowed specifically with the powers of compulsion aforesaid, and of immediate steps being taken with a view to its establishment as soon as possible. The meeting accepted the following resolution as a statement of their views on the subject : &apos;&apos; The meeting request the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to report to the Government that the industry is favourable to the Commission^ Report, and to emphasise the need for taking action upon the recommendations of the Commission at the earliest possible date.&quot;The meeting was also asked whether they thought it advisable or desirable that a poll of persons concerned should be taken before the scheme was put into operation, but the representatives were unanimously against it. They thought that it was unnecessary and would merely lead to undesirable delay.4. We, therefore, ask our colleagues to give general assent to the drafting of a Bill on the lines generally set out in paragraph 2 above. We think it desirable also to include in the Bill some provision for the development of line and seine fishing, which might provide alternative forms of livelihood for displaced herring fishermen, but we are in agreement with the Chancellor that this should not be brought forward pending a Report from the Sea-fish Commission, to whom the question has been referred.

5. The Report recommends that the Herring Board should be provided with certain Exchequer assistance and facilities for borrowing. We have discussed this matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who informs us that if the Cabinet give their assent to the principle of setting up a Herring Board on the lines recommended by the Sea-fish Commission he is prepared to agree to the inclusion in the necessary legislation of provision for financial assistance to the Board to meet their initial requirements.6. Subject to his being satisfied at the proper time on certain points relating to the Board&apos;s powers, the Chancellor is prepared, we understand, to agree to the following, viz. : (1) A grant of  125,000, spread over three years, partly as an annual grant towards the Board&apos;s expenses (say,  25,000 per annum), and partly as a lump sum to be drawn on for publicity, marketing, research, &amp;c.(2) Advances up to  600,000 on loan for the purposes of scrapping of old boats, renewal of nets, building of new boats and re-conditioning, financing of contracts (so far as necessary), working capital and contingencies.Schemes to be assisted from the loan money to be put forward within a time limit of (say) five years.7. Authority is accordingly desired for the preparation of a Bill, subject to adjustment with the Treasury, with a view to its early passage into law.8. The time table of the proposed legislation is very important, both in order that the Herring Board may be in operation at the earliest possible date and for financial reasons. The Treasury have pointed out that the  600,000 will require to be voted, and, as it is essential that the Vote should be taken in the current financial year, a Supplementary Estimate will require to be introduced in February, and it will be necessary that the Bill should be passed by the 31st March, 1935, in order to secure the inclusion of the money in the Appropriation Act.(Initialled)      G.
