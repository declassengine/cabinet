At their Meeting on the 24th October, 1934,(Cabinet 36 (34) Conclusion 11 (a)) the Cabinet approved in principle the recommendations contained in the Committee&apos;s Interim Report (paper CP. 82? (54)). The Committee have examined the proposals relative to the powers, duties and functions to be assigned to the proposed Commissioner for the Depressed Areas set out in the Appendix to this Report.      Subject to the following reservations the Committee recommend the Cabinet to approve these proposals as a basis for the necessary legislation.Responsibility for the scheme in Scotland,.(a)   As requested by the Cabinet the Committee have carefully considered the question whether there should be a separate Commissioner for Scotland, The matter Is not free from difficulty since while there are certain political and other advantages attaching to the proposal, it is&quot; open to objections of an administrative and financial character.      The question is to be further discussed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Labour, and pending such discussion the Committee make no recommendation on the point.Delimitation of Areas.(b)    The question of the delimitation of the Areas tobe covered by the Commissioner1s operations (seeparagraph 1 of Appendix) has also been considered bythe Committee.     Having regard to the fact that the&apos;limits were determined by the Investigators quitearbitrarily, it is certain that the strongest pos1.
pressure will be exerted in favour of&quot; extending the areas to cover other depressed districts. The Committee are of opinion that it is imperative to confine the areas to the limits prescribed &quot;by the Investigators defending this decision by emphasising that the particular areas have been selected as fields for experiment and research and that their boundaries could not be enlarged without grave danger of having to extend the scheme throughoutthe country.      For these reasons the Committeeasrecommend that the areas/surveyed by the Investigators should be adopted, and that power should not be taken to extend them.meral Control        (c)    The Chancellor of the Exchequer has intimated to &apos; the Minister:&apos;Labour,  etc. the Committee that paragraph 10 of the Appendix which deals with the relations between the Minister of Labour and the Commissioner, and between the Unemploy-ment Assistance Board and the Commissioner needs further consideration.      The Committee understand that this matter is to be discussed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour.      The proposals in paragraph IS of the Appendix relating to the period of appointment of the Commissioner and the question of the future responsibility for the functions now to be undertaken by the Commissioner must await the result of the discussion just referred to.is Financial (d)    The question of the sum to be voted into the Fund?provision.   &apos;referred to in paragraph 11 of the Appendix is under consideration &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.o
EMPLOYMENT H STANCE RELATION TO it NATIONAL [KMES.2.        There is one further point in connection with the Commissioner&apos; s activities to which attention should &quot;be drawn.     The position as regards unemployment assistance of men who take part in occupational schemes, such as for example, men who cultivate hare land holdings, will arise at an early stage of the Commissioner^ activities. Any man taking part in such schemes will wish to he assured that he will continue to receive assistance, otherwise there will be grave danger that the Commissioner will be handicapped in his experiments by the unwilling-ness of men to take part in them.      Care should, therefore, be taken to ensure that the Unemployment Assistance Board is consulted without delay as to the attitude that they would adopt with regard to the payment of unemploy-ment assistance to men taking part in occupational schemes.PORT OF THE IIJTERDEPART -MTAL )committee.3.       The Committee have also completed their examination of the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee (Paper CP.  220 (34-)) which contains a summary of the recommend-ations made by the Investigators and of the observations of the Government Departments thereon.    It will be recalled that the proposals regarding training,  transfer and cognate matters which were set out in Section II of this Report have, with the exception of two matters, been approved in principle by the Cabinet subject to the dis-cussion of details between the Treasury, Ministry of Labour and other Departments concerned.4. One of the two matters in question, namely, theproposal for a grant of additional money for welfare work to the National Council of Social Service and the Scottish Council will fall to be considered in connection with the appointment of the Commissioner for the Depressed Areas.SHIPMENT MUNICIPAL TcACTOES -AGEMB.1HT OP I.5. The other matter related to a suggestion thatOovernment and Municipal Contractors should be required to
engage their labour through the Employment Exchanges. This proposal has sinoe been investigated in consultation with the principal Contracting departments.     It is understood that the latter see certain difficulties in applying compulsion to Government Contractors in this respect, but it has been agreed that an appeal should be issued to such Contractors urging them to employ their labour through the Employment Exchanges.6.        The Committee accordingly recommend that Contract-ors obtaining Government contracts should be urged to engage their labour through the Employment Exchanges, and that Local Authorities should be invited to make a similar appeal to their own Contractors. 7. The Committee have further considered whether anappeal on similar lines should be issued to employers generally and it appears to them that this could best be done on local lines in the form of appeals to employers in particular areas, rather than by means of a general appeal.IPTERDEPART -       8. Of the other matters raised in the Report of SirMENTALCOMMITTEE&apos;S Horace Wilson1 s Committee, a number will now fall to beREPORT SECTIONS III - X.considered by the proposed Commissioner for the Depressed Areas.      To others, active consideration is still being given by the Departments or Bodies concerned.     It does not appear necessary under either of these heads to trouble the Cabinet at this stage with the various suggestions in detail.0&quot;        In certain cases, however, the Committee have been able to arrive at definite conclusions and their observations and recommendations are set out below. Grants in respect of Land Drainage,10,        The question has been raised whether, in order to expedite certain schemes of Land Drainage in the depressed areas, grants should be made to Drainage Author-(ities other than Catchment Boards,    The Committee have4..   1
considered this matter carefully and recommend thatno change should be made in the 1930/31 settlement underwhich assistance is granted only through properly con-stituted Catchment Boards.Arterial Drainage in Scotland.11.       The Committee are of the opinion that the suggested provision for Arterial Drainage in Scotland falls outside the scope of the scheme for dealing with the depressed areas, V/hitehaven Harbour.12.        The Committee have invited the Minister of Transport to proceed as rapidly as possible with an enquiry into the proposal for improving Whitehaven Harbour. Jarrow Slake.13.        The Committee understand that any increase of traffic that resulted from the execution of this scheme would almost certainly be at the expense of other East Coast Ports.      They accordingly do not feel able to recommend, that any grant should be made from the Exchequer in aid of this scheme. Road Tunnel under the Tyne.14.        The Committee have asked the Minister of Transport for his opinion on this proposal, and in particular whether local support is likely to be forthcoming for the scheme if the grant from the Road Fund does not exceed 60%.Senghenydd to Nelson Road.15.        The Committee are unable to recommend a grant in respect of this road, and suggest that no further action should be taken. Housing.16.        The Committee have considered the question of making a special contribution in aid of housing in the
depressed areas.      They think, however, that pending the appointment of the Commissioner and consideration by the Cabinet of housing policy generally, further examination of the question should be deferred. Local Government.17.    The Committee agree with the Minister of Health and recommend to the Cabinet that an examination should be made -without delay into the Local Government arrangements on Tyneside and at Merthyr Tydfil respectively.experiments to be undertaken by the Commissioner will necessarily take some time to develop.     They recommend accordingly that favourable consideration should be given to the question whether special priority should be allowed in the case of any Public Works Schemes of an economic value which would be undertaken in the normal course in the depressed areas.19o    THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER was prevented by indisposition from attending the Meeting of the Committee at which the form of this Report was settled. It is, however, understood that he is in general agreement with the Conclusions reached by the Committee.SO. The Committee submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet;-ELIC WORKS THE DEPRESSED18.It seems clear to the Committee that the

APPENDIX. A    1THE SUGGESTED power,   DUTIES,  AFP FUNCTIONS OF THE PROPOSED COMMISSIONER &apos; FOR THE DEPRESSED AREAS,1.     The general functions of the Commissioner are defined as follows%-&quot;to be responsible for the initiation, organisation and prosecution of schemes designed tc facilitate the economic development and social improvement of the four Areas surveyed by the Investigators&quot;.(N.B. The exact delimitation of the Areas to be covered and the question whether power should be taken to extend them will need careful consideration).The above general definition is subject to two limitations, (i) Ordinarily he is to devote himself to work which cannot be done under existing powers, (ii) He will not have power to subsidise industrial undertakings trading for profit. 2.      The first of these limitations means that he will not be able to undertake schemes of a kind which are already being done or can be done by Government Departments or Local Authorities, and that any assistance he might give towards such schemes would have to be of a different nature from that available from the appropriate Department.      Outside this field a number of proposals have been made of which the most  important are the following:-(a) Improving the amenities of the depressed areas - e,g. by the removal of slagheaps,  the clearance of derelict factory sites etc.(b) Provision of occupational centres for the unemployed, including agricultural subsistence holdings and other centres where the products of the members are retained by or are exchanged among themselves.(c) Experiments in agricultural holdings in the depressed areas,  including co-operative holdings.      (Under experiments of this kind farming operations involving the employment of workpeople might be undertaken by a Corporation, with the assistance of the Commissioner).
The Commissioner should have peer to assist schemes of the above types;   but in the case of occupational centres his power to assist should be limited to centres not carried on for profit.3.       The Commissioner should also have power to consider for assistance other schemes which satisfy the conditions of paragraph (l) above.4.        The Commissioner should not be precluded from assisting schemes outside the depressed areas which would employ work-people from those areas.5.       While as already stated the Commissioner should not be empowered to undertake works falling within the existing powers or duties of Government Departments or Local Authorities he should be at liberty to bring to the notice of the appropriate Government Department or Local Authority schemes which in his view satisfy the main condition in paragraph 1 and ought to be carried!, out.      The Commissioner could also bring to the notice of the appropriate Department any suitable schemes which were not being carried out owing to the inability of Local Authorities to finance them or to some other difficulty.      The case of land drainage provides an example of the way in which the Commissioner might work under this procedure.    There are land drainage works which could profitably be undertaken and which would provide a good deal of employment in Durham, South Wales and West Cumberland. The Ministry of Agriculture consider it undesirable to make grants in aid of land drainage except to Catchment Boards. Difficulty arises in setting up Catchment Boards owing to the objections of Count:/ Boroughs which would be involved in increased rates disproportionate to the advantages they would obtain.      If, however,  it could, be announced that, provided, the Commissioner recommended it, a grant would be made from the Exchequer sufficient to allay the fears of the local authorities concerned it is probable that the objections to setting up Catchment Boards would disappear.
6. It seems undesirable that the Commissioner himselfshould carry out scheyr.es,  as this would involve him in a mass of detail.      He should be empowered to enter into arrangements with other persons or bodies for the carrying out of such schemes as fall within his province, e.g.  the cleaning up of the depressed areas might be carried out through an Amenities Trust, the co-operative agricultural holdings through an Agricultural Corporation,   the provision of occupational centres or other welfare work  through come vo1untary organieat ion.7. Existing Exchequer grants made in respect of welfarework in or on behalf of the depressed areas e.g.   grants to.the National Council for Social Service,  and any additional grants to be made for similar purposes should in future be made through the Commissioner. 3. In order that he may be able to carry out his functions it will be necessary to give the Commissioner power to acquire land, expeditiously and. compulsorily, to hold, land,  to sell it and to transfer it   to Local Authorities or public bodies,9. Questions may arise whether the Commissioner can accept contributions from non-Government sources. Provided there are not attached to these contributions conditions which would embarrass the Commissioner in his freedom of action or render him accountable to  outside&apos; bodies, it is thought that he should have such powers. /DO.        The Commissioner will have wide discretion but will be subject to the general control of the Minister of Labour. Arrangements will be made for all necessary consultations with the Departments and bodies concerned including the Unemployment Assistance Board.7
11. For the purpose of meeting the expenditure of theCommissioner,  it is proposed that a sum of  X should he voted to a separate Fund under the control of the Treasury, to he expended by them in such annual issues to the Commissioner as parliament may from time to time determine.      Some additional sum would presumably have to be voted to the Commissioner direct for his needs in the current year.      This procedure appears to permit provision of funds out of this year*s Budget and at the Game time to allow Parliamentary control over the issues from year to year. /I2. It is suggested that the Commissioner should beappointed for three years, after which, unless Parliament should determine otherwise, such of his powers, duties and responsibilities as have been proved to be of continuing value might be transferred to the Unemployment Assistance 3obv6J7
