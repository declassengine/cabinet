Copy No^QCP. 297 (34).CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON  THE  TWENTY-FIFTH  ANNIVERSARY   OF  THEKINCS ACCESSION.Second- Report.1. AT their Meeting on the 4th July. 1934 (Cabinet 27 (34), Conclusion 8). the Cabinet had before them the First Report (CP. 168 (34)) of the Cabinet Committee set up on the 30th May, 1934, to formulate, for consideration by the Cabinet, a scheme for the Celebration of the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the King&apos;s Accession. The Draft Sketch Programme for the Celebrations in London and for the Reviews was annexed as an Appendix to that Report and received the general approval in principle of the Cabinet. On the 30th July the Lord President of the Council announced in the House of Commons His Majesty&apos;s approval in principle of certain proposals relating to the Celebrations, including inter alia the Thanksgiving Service at St. PauPs Cathedral, and stated that details of the contemplated Programme would be published later.2. Since the consideration in July last of the Draft Sketch Programme by the Cabinet, a number of further suggestions have been made involving modification of certain items of the original Programme, and alterations of dates in the light of information now available as to His Majesty The King&apos;s wishes. A further Meeting of the Cabinet Committee was accordingly held on the 14th December, and a revised Sketch Programme for the Celebrations in London. The King&apos;s Visit to Edinburgh and the Reviews has been drawn up.3. The revised Sketch Programme is shown as an Appendix to this Report and is recommended to the Cabinet for approval, on the understanding that modifications may prove to be necessary as a result of further consideration by His Majesty.4. In submitting the revised Sketch Programme to the Cabinet, the Committee wish to draAv attention to certain matters relating thereto, and also to certain questions which have arisen in connection with the Silver Jubilee Celebrations.   These ar^e dealt with in the following paragraphs.Thanksgiving Service at St. PauVs Cathedral.5. The Committee consider that the congregation to be provided for at the Thanksgiving Service should, in the first instance at any rate, not exceed 4,500. It is understood that the Lord Chamberlain, in whose name the invitations to the Service will be issued, proposes to set up a small representative Committee with the object of allocating the available seating accommodation.6.&apos; It is suggested that representatives of Religious Bodies other than the Established Church should be invited to be present at the Service. The representation of these Bodies should be based on the denominational representa tion at the Service at the Cenotaph on Armistice Day. The representatives of &quot; Religious Bodies other than the Established Church will not take part in the conduct of the actual Service, but it is contemplated that they will join in the ecclesiastical Procession in the Cathedral.[10913] B
7. As already announced, there will be a State Drive to and from St. Pauls Cathedral. The Committee think that, having regard to the general public interest likely to be aroused, this function should be as imposing and impressive as practicable. It is thought, therefore, that as many State carriages as possible should take part, that the various Members of the Royal Family should proceed along the route to the Cathedral in separate processions, and that other important personages, including the Dominion Prime Ministers and The King&apos;s Indian A.D.C.&apos;s, should take part.Illuminations.S. The First Commissioner of Works has informed the Committee that considerable progress has been made with the scheme for the flood lighting of public buildings during the week commencing Monday, 6th May. The King-has sanctioned the proposal that Buckingham Palace should be floodlit on 6th May. Arrangements for the floodlighting of St. James&apos;s Palace. St. James&apos;s Park, and a number of public buildings in different parts of London have also been made.9. The First Commissioner of Works has reported that the necessary installations for the floodlighting will probably be carried out by the interests concerned without cost to the Exchequer. He anticipates that if a public announcement could be made at an early date as to the Governments decision that public buildings should be floodlit during the Celebrations, a number of further offers would be received. It is. therefore, recommended that such an announce-ment should be made as early as possible.Presentation of Addresses by both Hotises of Parliament.10. The King is not yet in a position to signify his wishes with regard to the proposal that the Presentation of Addresses by both Houses of Parliament should take place in Westminster Hall. Should His Majesty approve this pro-posal, the Committee think that arrangements should be made to ensure the Ceremony being as impressive as circumstances will permit.Processional Drives.11. It was originally proposed that there should be two Drives, to be linked up with a Children&apos;s Fete at Wembley Stadium and a River Progress. These two items have had. however to be abandoned, and it is now proposed that there should be four Processional Drives through the North, South, East and West of London respectively, and that in addition there should be a State Drive to the City for the Presentation of an Address from the City of London at Guildhall, followed by a State Luncheon. In the case of each Processional Drive the schoolchildren from the area will be assembled along the route of the Drive and in the case of the Drive through North London it is proposed that representative bodies of the British Legion, Boy Scouts, and other similar organisations should be drawn up in Hvde Park. In this way it is hoped that as many schoolchildren and members of these bodies as possible will be able to greet Their Majesties without the necessity for any formal review. It is suggested that in no case should the actual Drive in an open carriage exceed three-quarters of an hour.Presentation of Addresses from Privileged Bodies.12. The Lord Chamberlain, has informed the Committee that additions to the list of Privileged Bodies cannot be entertained and that he proposes to confer with the Home Office as to the possibility of reducing the number of Addresses actually to be presented in person during the Silver Jubilee Celebrations.13. It is understood that the Address from the City of London will he presented at Guildhall on the occasion of the proposed State Luncheon there on Wednesday, the 22nd May.Reviews.14. (a) The date of the Naval Review has already been announced for the 16th July. It has been pointed out to us on behalf of the Admiralty, that the estimates of expenditure given in our First Report preclude elaborate arrange-ments for the entertainment of Members of both Houses of Parliament and other distinguished visitors, such as the hire of special liners, a course which was
adopted on a former occasion. The Admiralty have proposed that Members of both Houses of Parliament and other official guests should be accommodated in the Ships being reviewed. In this way the necessary accommodation and enter-tainment would be provided for satisfactorily at comparatively slight cost. The Committee, after examining this proposal, recommended its adoption by the Cabinet.(b) It has been necessary to reconsider the dates of the Army and Air Force Reviews to suit His Majesty&apos;s arrangements. At present the proposal, which is receiving further examination, is that the Air Force Review should take place on Saturday, the 6th July, and the Army Review on Saturday, the 13th July.His Majesty The King&apos;&apos;s Visit to Edinburgh.15. The proposal has been made that The King should make a halt in Edinburgh on his journey to Balmoral late in August, and should receive in the Hall of the Parliament House at Edinburgh the Addresses from the Scottish Privileged Bodies. The King would drive through the streets which would be lined by representative detachments of the Services (drawn from Edinburgh and its neighbourhood) including Scottish Territorials, and also by Boy Scouts. It may also be possible on this occasion for His Majesty to lay the Foundation Stone of the new Government Buildings in Edinburgh, but a final decision on this point must be reserved for the present.Celebrations in Wales.16. It is hoped that the Prince of Wales may be able to take part in a ceremony either at Cardiff, where Cathay&apos;s Park would be suitable, or at Carnarvon Castle. From the point of view of convenience of access, &amp;c, Cardiff would be the more suitable centre for such a ceremony.Payment of Wages on Bank Holiday, May 6.17. This question raises considerable difficulties and complexities. The Committee have invited the Departments chiefly concerned, i.e., the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour, to confer on the matter with a view to a further report hem&quot;- made to the Cabinet at a later date.Representation of Empire Youth Organisations.18. The Committee have been informed of a proposal that representatives of Empire Youth Organisations, e.g., Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, from different parts of the Empire, should be present during the Silver Jubilee Celebrations in London. They are proposing to give further consideration to this question, but here point out that these Organisations themselves are apparently not in a position to meet more than a part of the cost of transportation to and of main-ten ance in this country. In the event of the Government approving the proposal, a not inconsiderable charge on the Exchequer may be involved.Publicity.19. It has been reported to the Committee that requests for a more detailed public statement regarding the Silver Jubilee Celebrations are being received from many quarters. The Committee felt, however, that at the present stage any further announcement should only be in quite general terms. The desirability of such an announcement was, however, recognised, and a draft statement is accordingly annexed to this report as Appendix II, which, if approved by His Majesty Tire King, might form the basis of a published statement.20. As announced in the House of Commons on the 30th July last, His Majesty desires that the Celebrations should be on a local basis, and that His Majesty&apos;s Subjects should, wherever practicable, have the opportunity of observing the occasion near their homes. The Committee strongly recommend that this conclusion should be strictly observed and maintained.21.   The Committee recommend to the Cabinet :  (l)That subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval, the revised Sketch Programme for the Silver Jubilee Celebrations, and the various suggestions and recommendations contained in this Report relating thereto, should be adopted.
(2) That subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval, a further announcement an general terms of the arrangements for the Celebrations should be published.(3) That an announcement should be made as early as possible of the decision that public buildings will be floodlit during the Celebrations.(4) That Members of Parliament and other official visitors to the Naval Review at Spithead should be accommodated in His Majesty&apos;s Ships, thus obviating any necessity for incurring heavy expense on matters such as the hiring of Liners for the occasion.(5) To take note that a further Report on the question of the payment of wages on Bank Holiday (the 6th May) will be submitted in due course.Signed on behalf of the Committee :JOHN GILMOUR, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, December 17, 1934.
