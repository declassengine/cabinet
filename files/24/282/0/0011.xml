    THIS DOCUMENT IS TFE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;5  GOVERNMENT.EGRET.                                                    COPY NO.  Q2____.P.11(39).                            CABINET.                 Deer and Ground Game (Scotland),  Bill.          Memorandum by the Secretary of  State  for  Scotland.       1.    On the 26th January 1958 the  Cabinet  agreed  (Cabinet 2(38)  Conclusion 8)  to authorise my predecessor  to  prepare a  Bill for the  prevention, of damage by deer  in Scotland on the lines set out  in a  memorandum submitted by him in CP.9(38),       2.    It was deemed advisable  before completing  the details of  a  Bill to  have further consultations with  accredited representatives  of the landowning and farming interests in order  to  secure  the  widest possible measure of acceptance of  the  proposals.  As a result  a  few minor modifications have been made,  the most important of  which is provision for the appointment  of  an Advisory Committee  whose functions would be to advise the  Department on proposals made  by local  Deer Regulation Committees and on other questions arising  in the administration of the  measure.       3.    While I am now in a position  to  submit  a Bill dealing with  the deer problem to the Home  Affairs Committee, I have  delayed  taking this step because I consider that  it would be of advantage if  the same measure included legislation for  Scotland on  the&apos; subject of  rabbits and ground game.   The Bill would  be  named the  &quot;Deer and  Ground Game (Scotland) Bill&quot;.       4.    On 9th November 1938 (CP,251(38))  the  Minister of  Agriculture and Fisheries submitted to  the Cabinet proposals for a  Bill  dealing with damage by rabbits (Crops (Prevention  of Damage)  Bill).  At my desire the Bill was so drawn as  not to apply to  Scotland.    The Cabinet agreed to  the Minister&apos;s  proposals  to                                                             make/
make arrangements, if opportunity offered, for entrusting thisEill to a Private Member (Cabinet 54(38) Conclusion 16).  The Bill,now known as the Prevention of Damage by Rabbits Bill, was introduced in. the House&apos;of Lords on 24th November, and passed the committee stage on 20th December,     5.   The Scheme of Part I of the Prevention, of Damage by RabbitsBill is to empower local authorities to enforce provisions for theprevention of damage by rabbits.   I am satisfied, after consultationwith the associations x^epresentative of County Councils, landownersand tenant farmers in Scotland, that those proposals would not bepopular1 in Scotland, fox1 various reasons, and that, if applied,little or no use would be made of them.   In the case of eachassociation it was repx*esented that the administering authority should be the Department of Agriculture fox- Scotland.   Part II ofthe Deer and Ground Game (Scotland) Bill contains px^proposals on theselines.     6.   Part III of the Bill provides for the amendment of theGround Game Acts 1830-1906 and of Section 7 of the protection of animals (Scotland) Act 1912 in oro.er to x^educe to a reasonable extent the number of statutory restrictions that are at present imposed onan occupier of agricultural land in. the exercise of his rights tokeep down ground game.   These proposals axe believed to have the&apos;suppoxi of the interests concerned and particularly of occupying .farrniexe in Scotland.   The principal amendments proposed are -          (l) In tex^ms of the Acts, only the occupier&apos; and one other     person authorised by him may use fireaxmis for the destruction     of ground game on his holding.    &quot;this restriction applies to     all holdings without regard to their* -nature or area.   It is     proposed to enable? the Depar-tment on application being made  and     after prescribed procedure,- to increase the number of persons wire     may be authorised to use fireaxras for the purpose.   Provision     would be made for the recall or variation of this sanction     should circumstances render such a  step just or reasonable.
              (2)  On moorlands and unenclosed lands,  which constitute         the bulk  of the area of sheep farms, the occupier is         forbidden, by the Acts to  kill rabbits and hares during         the breeding period from 1st April to 31st August.   He         may kill  otherwise than with firearms from 1st September         to 31st March:   he may use firearms only from 11th December         to  31st  March.   It is proposed to allow the farmer to         kill rabbits and hares on. unenclosed lands throughout the         year but  to restrict his use of firearms to the period         between 1st November&apos; and 31st March.         7.   The  Treasury have been consulted and have no objections    to the proposals in. the Bill, and I desire the authority of my    colleagues for the submission of the Bill as prepared to the    Committee of Home Affairs.   I think that it would be advantageous    to introduce it in. the House of Lords.                                               J.C.Scottish Office    19th January,  1939.
