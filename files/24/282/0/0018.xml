THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the  Cabinet.  January 1939.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 18(39).CABINET.PALESTINE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I HAD  intended  to circulate to my colleagues,  before the opening of  thediscussions on Palestine policy  with the Arab and  Jewish delegates who  are about to assemble in London, a memorandum setting  forth how the problemsat issue are regarded from the point of view of our general foreign relations.    2.  I have now, however, bad the opportunity of reading the memorandum(Cabinet Paper No. 4&apos;(39)) circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,and I feel that his paper gives  all the material necessary for our deliberationsin Cabinet and  the Cabinet Committee on Palestine.    3.  It is perhaps inevitable that  I  should look at  the Palestine problem from a slightly different angle from that in which it presents itself to the colonial secretary.  And  I  should not wish  my colleagues  to assume that I  am in  full agreement with the memorandum on every point, or that  I endorse all the opinions expressed therein, although I gratefully acknowledge the place that the colonial secretary, in the  preparation of  his paper, has given to the considerations whichit has been my duty to bring to his notice.  I am moreover very glad to  see,from  paragraph  53 of the  Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum,  that  on the  onequestion of substantial importance  regarding which he and I are  at  presentinclined to take different  views,  namely, the question how far in  the last resortwe should go to meet the Arab delegates in the matter of future Jewish immigration into Palestine, he is prepared for the present not to press for a final decision.    4.  In these  circumstances,  I do not propose,  unless my colleagues instructme to do so, to  circulate  a paper regarding  Palestine policy in  its  relation toforeign affairs and our foreign  policy as  a whole.                                                                       H.    January 23,  1939.10230  [18540]
