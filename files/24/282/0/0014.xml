COPY NO.CP. 14(39)              NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME 1959.       MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE -.ADMIRALTY *          The proposed new construction programme for 1939 isas follows:-                 2 Capital Ships.                 1 Aircraft Carrier.                 4 Cruisers.                16 Destroyers.                 4 Submarines.                20 Past Escort Vessels.                 3 Escort Vessels (Normal type).                10 Minesweepers.                 1 Fast Minelayer.                 1 Motor Torpedo Boat Depot Ship.                 2 River Gunboats.                 1 Hospital Ship.                12 Motor Torpedo Boats.                 2 Boom Defence Vessels.                 1 Fleet Target Service Tug.                   and miscellaneous  small craft.          A table is attached to show the financial effect ofthese proposals.     2.   Tv/o capital ships represent the largest programme  it  ispossible for us to undertake in  1939, having regard to the numbersof these ships now under construction,  and the  limitations of our                                             productive......                                                             *7*
productive capacity for heavy guns,  gun mountings and armour.It will he seen that little money will he spent on them during next financial year and it is not intended to order the secondship until March, 1940.   It is intended that &quot;both shall be  16&quot;gun ships of 40,000 tons.     3.   By March, 1944,  by which date these two ships shouldcomplete, and assuming that our capital ship strength remains at19 ships (i.e. the figure  recently given, with Cabinet authority,to the Germans) the fleet  will consist of nine new ships, twoNELSONS designed in 1922,  HOOD designed in 1916, four fullymodernised old ships, and three old ships which have been extensivelyrefitted but only partially modernised.   Of this total, at least one ship will be in hand for Large Repair.   By the same date,  itis estimated that the combined German and Japanese Fleets v/illcontain 20 or 21 capital ships, in addition to the three german armoured ships of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; class of 10,000 tons with11&quot; guns.   Of these 20 or 21 ships, 10 or 11 (6 German and 4 or 5Japanese) will be new ships as compared with the British 9, andall the remainder will be fully modernised.   The above takes no account of the Italian Fleet, which by March, 1944, v/ill probablycontain 4 new and 4 modernised capital ships.     4.   The aircraft carrier is in replacement of one of theold carriers now in service.     5.   The four cruisers, like the battleships, representthe practical limit of our present productive capacity underpeace  conditions.   The .pro jected vessels v/ill all be large ships of approximately 8,000 tons, capable of use on the trade routes for trade  protection purposes.   When these ships complete by about theend of 1942, the Navy (including Dominion ships) v/ill possess 65cruisers, 14 of v/hich v/ill be small ships intended for servicev/ith the Battlef leets, and the remainder vessels of the 8-inch  gun
type or 6--inch gun ships comparable, with the shipsprojected for this year.  In addition, sixteen of the oldestsmall cruisers instead of being scrapped will have been-armed as A/A ships, for use-with convoys and for protectionof trade on routes most liable to air attach.   I need notremind my colleagues that the Admiralty have always held theview that seventy cruisers represents the minimum number required for safety, even when the only attack envisaged was from the Japanese Fleet as it was before the present phase of re-armament.  6.     As regards the proposal to include two destroyerflotillas, my colleagues will remember that the Admiraltyagreed to drop the flotilla originally proposed for last year,but only with great reluctance, and on the understanding thatit was deferred and not abandoned.   The result of the crisisover Czechoslovakia and of consultations with the principalCommanders-in-Chief since, has been to emphasise the existingserious shortage of modern vessels of this class capable ofworking with the Fleet and comparable in strength and speedto the newer ships in other Navies.    More recently, there hasbeen the German notification of the intention to build up tolOCfo of our submarine tonnage.    The additional submarines (forwhich it is possible that advance preparations may already havebeen made) can be built more rapidly than destroyers.   TheGermans already possess 69 submarines and the Italians 104.If the Germans continue to build their present  types  they  maypossess well over 100 in a few years&apos; time.  7.     The proposal to build 20 fast escort vessels of a new type,  which was  approved by the Cabinet on 7th November last,does  not obviate the necessity for building more destroyers,since the escort vessels are smaller ships of under 1000 tons                                           and.....
                                                           4 * Z                          - 4 -                            JL j. vand of limited endurance, unsuitable for working with theFleet or for employment under conditions where they might berequired to engage surface craft carrying an armamentcomparable to that of a modern destroyer.  Their primaryduty is to provide A/A and A/S escorts for merchant ships,transports, liners, etc.  8.    I should like to emphasise that the Admiralty attach the greatest importance to increasing our strength in types of vessels which are most suited for coping with the submarine.A shortage of such vessels would not only affect the operations of the Fleet but the movements of every ship within thepossible danger areas.   The Board consider it to be vital that,should we be once again faced with unlimited submarine warfare,we should be in a reasonably favourable&apos; position to counter it from the beginning.   If we are not, it may be most difficultto overtake our initial shortage, even if every possible effort is made to do so.  9.    The hospital ship is required to replace the  MAINE,now 37 years old.   This ship has been put off year after year.The MAINE is almost completely worn out and her accommodation is no longer up to modern requirements.  10.    The crisis over Czechoslovakia also drew pointedattention to the shortage of minesweepers and this programmeincludes the shallow draught minesweepers (now 10 in number)approved by the Cabinet on the 7th November (Cabinet 53 (38) ).  11.    The 20 fast escort vessels and the fast minelayerincluded in the programme are the vessels which were approvedby the Cabinet on the 7th November (Cabinet 53 (38) ).  12.    I should perhaps add that, with Treasury sanction,we are purchasing ten commercial  trawlers for conversion  tominesweeping.   These vessels, like the trawlers (now 5 in number) which are being purchased as a result of the cabinet conclusion quoted above, and which are intended for anti-submarinepurposes, are being treated as part of the 1938 programme.
