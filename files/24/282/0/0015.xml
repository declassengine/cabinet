THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTYY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;.SECRET.COPY NO.CP. 15 (59).                CABINET.            SAFETY IN COAL MINES.       Report of the Royal Commission.Note hy the President of the Board of Trade.     I am circulating for the consideration of mycolleagues a memorandum hy the Secretary for Mines onthe action to be taken on the Report of the RoyalCommissioner on Safety in Coal Mines.     I agree with the Secretary for Mines&apos;  proposalsfor dealing with the Report and its financial implications, and I recommend that he be authorised tomake the statement, in reply to a question in the Housenext week, which is set out in paragraph 9 of his memorandum.   That statement would commit us to theintroduction of two Bills:  first a short Bill this session to remove the statutory limitation imposed onthe Mines Department&apos;s annual expenditure by the MiningIndustry Act, 1920;  and secondly a Safety in Coal mines bill which would be introduced at some future date, butnot this Session.0.F.G.S.Board of Trade.   26th January, 1939-.
* Circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 160(35), which was  considered 15th October, 1935 2CaDinet 46(55),  conclusion (S^/7.               Action on Report of the Royal Commission                        on Safety in Coal Mines,                  Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.   1.  The appointment of the Royal Commission on Safety in CoalMines was one of the principal features of the announcement,madeby the Government in the autumn of 1935, regarding their generalpolicy for the coal mining industry.  It was explained in theCabinet Committee Memorandum^ (CM.I. (35) 2), recommending this announcement, that extensive changes in the industry necessitateda new Act of Parliament amending and consolidating the exisitngsafety lav/ (now nearly 30 years old); and that, before this could be undertaken, important questions relating especially tothe general principles and organization of safety and health inmines required exhaustive inquiry by an authoritative body0Notes on some of these matters, namely, the principle ofmanagerial responsibility, the duties of the subordinate safetyofficials (deputies), inspections on behalf of the workmen, theprinciples of Government inspection, and the &quot;human&quot; or &quot;personal&quot;factor in safety, were appended to the Memorandum.   2.  After an inquiry lasting for nearly three years, theCommission, which sat under the Chairmanship of Lord Rockley,has submitted a comprehensive Report which (subject to very fewreservations, and these mostly on points of relatively minor importance) is unanimous.  The unanimous recomnendations dealwith all the general questions of principle referred to above,and they also cover a wide field on the technical aspects of  safety and health in relation to the different methods of work, and  insome of these matters the treatment extends into considerable detail,  y unanimous Report from this Commission carries great weight, having regard to the experience, ability and technical knowledge of the members, six of whom directly  represented  theowners, officials and workers in the industry.  It amounts  in
effect to the agreed view of eminent representatives of all sections of the industry, supported hy the Chief Inspector of mines, who only retired during the course of the inquiry, aneminent Civil Servant, who was head of the health and safetyadministration at the Home Office, and an authoritative outsideelement.  In these circumstances, and in the absence, so far,of any public criticism of the Report,- there are very stronggrounds for accepting the Commission&apos;^ findings in general, andno grounds for rejecting them.   3. But acceptance in general should not be allowed to implyacceptance in detail, for there has not been time yet for eithermy Department or the representative bodies of the industryto examine all the implications of a very long Report orto define their attitudes towards particular recommendations..The Government could, however, properly accept the Report asa whole, while reserving for further consideration their decisionon individual recommendations, many of which will in any casearise for discussion by Parliament on the legislation,   4.  In the main, as was fully  recognized before the commission was set up, that acceptance involves important legislation.  TheCoal Mines Act, 1911, comprises 127 sections, and its modernrepresentative is likely to be considerably bigger,notwithstanding the Commissions recommendation that it  should be confined,  sofar as possible, to principles, leaving  the.details  to be dealtwith by  subsequent  regulation.   In addition to  the matters  ofprinciple referred  to,  it must, for instance,  include  fundamentalprovisions on which the  detailed  safety  regulations  will bebased,  in particular  as  regards  such  important  matters  asventilation, support  of  workings, haulage and  travelling belowground, the prevention of explosions and  the like.   The  preparationof a  Bill of this  size  will obviously  take  time  and  cannot  becompleted soon  enough for   introduction  this  Session,   The  HomeAffairs  Committee  have,  in  fact,  already noted such  a  Bill  as
suitable for inclusion in the programme for next Session.   5. The question therefore arises - &quot;What can be done in themeantime1? &quot;     (l) There is a substantial part of the Commission&apos; srecommendations, particularly those which deal with the strengthening and reorganization of the Mines Inspectorate andof the administrative services, on which administrative action can be commenced forthwith.   The scope and details of therecommendations have still to be examined by the Mines department and the Treasury, but it is clear that a reorganization on thegeneral lines recommended cannot be achieved immediately but  only by stages extending over several years and that it will cost  agood deal of money.     (3) There are certain matters which involve further detailedinquiry by technical committees, and these inquiries can be putin hand.     (3) There are some groups of recommendations on the technicalaspect of safety and health which can be implemented, withoutprejudice to the ensuing legislation, by the powers of regulationwhich are already available under the existing law, and it isproposed to explore these with a view to taking such action as  isconsidered practicable during the period which must necessarilyelapse before any new legislation can become effective.     (4) Some of the recommendations are in the nature ofexhortations to the industry and do not require legislation orany specific administrative action.    I shall take every opportunity of pressing home this advice.   6. The position as regards finance is as follows.   Theexpenditure of the Mines Department is limited by Section 5(2)  ofthe Mining Industry Act, 1920, to  250,000, including the cost  ofAllied Services.   The duties of the Department have been increased considerably in the last few years, notably by the  CoalMines Act, 1930, the Petroleum (Production) Act, and the
1(0 1Goal Act, 1938, and it would not have &quot;been possible to providefor them in the Estimates for next year but for Section 17 ofthe Goal Mines Act, 1930, by which expenditure under that Act isnot taken into account for the purpose of the  250,000 limit.  Asimilar provision was included in the Goal (Registration of ownership) Act, 1937,   7. The position when framing Estimates which, after deductingthe excepted expenditure referred to above, approach the limit of  250,000 is a difficult one, since the amount required inrespect of Allied Services is estimated by other Departments,   8. The expenditure necessitated by the acceptance in generalof the main recommendations of-the Report of the Royal Commissionin particular the strengthening and reorganization of the inspector and administrative services, would mean that theexpenditure of the Department would immediately exceed the 250,000,   In the circumstances I suggest that a short Billshould be introduced at an early date to remove the statutory limit;  the Treasury .agree with this proposal,   9, The authority of the Cabinet is sought for dealing withthe Report and its financial implications in the mannerindicated, and for making the following reply to a Question asto the Government1s intentions which Mr, James Griffiths has putdown for answer on 31st January and which he has been asked to postpone for a day or two:-          &quot;The Government have given careful consideration during     the Recess to this comprehensive and valuable Report,     Further time is required for the consideration in detail of     each of the very numerous recommendations, but the     Government accept the Report in its general sense and     purport and will commence immediately to take the necessary     steps towards implementing it.          In so far as this decision involves legislation the     necessary preparations for a Bill are being put in hand                               -4-
immediately, but such a measure will necessarily be longand complicated and I am afraid it is not possible to have it ready for introduction this Session.     Action will, however, be taken in the meantime with aview to a substantial strengthening and. reorganization of the mines Inspectorate and the administrative services.  I amalso closely examining certain other of the Commission&apos;srecommendations to see how far they can be dealt with by wayof Regulation, or otherwise, under the existing powers whereit is found practicable to do this without prejudice to, orconfusion with, the impending legislation.     These reforms will involve expenditure that cannot bemet within the statutory limitation imposed on the MinesDepartment Vote by the Mining Industry Act, 1920, and as a necessary preliminary step the Government propose tointroduce shortly a Bill to remove that limit.     I may perhaps be allowed to add that the Report callsattention to a number of improvements which it is possiblefor the industry to make on its own initiative and I would,  .therefore, invite all concerned to see how far such recommendations can be implemented in advance of any legislation.&quot;                                  11.0.Mines Department.      24th January, 1939.
