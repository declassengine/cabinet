On the  main issue? namely,  our  attitude in the event              of a German invasion  of Holland, we have had the benefit              of a report from the Chiefs of Staff&apos; dated the 25th  January              which is appended to  this report (CO.S0  830) 0.  It will bex  Already circulated to  the  Foreign Policy Committee as     Paper No. F.P*  (36)  77 0
seen that this report is in continuation of the first report by the Chiefs of Staff on this matter dated the24th january . which was before the Cabinet on Wednesdaylast (C.Po 20(39)),30     The Chiefs of Staff are of opinion that there isno hope of preventing Holland being overrun, and that therestoration of her territory would depend on the latercourse of the war (paragraph 19) 0  They do not recommend thedespatch by uhis country of a Field Force to Holland,whether France or Belgium are our allies or ore neutral(paragraphs 10 and 14)04.     The main conclusion of the Chiefs of Staff is summarised in the final paragraph of their Report of the25th January which reads as follows :--            &quot;If we were compelled to enter such a war       in the near future we should be confronted with       a position more serious than the Empire has ever       faced beforeo  The ultimate outcome of the       conflict might well depend upon the intervention       of other Powers, in particular of the United       States of American            Nevertheless, as we have pointed out in our       first Report (paragraph 12), failure to intervene       would have su.ch moral and other repercussions as       would seriously undermine our position in the       eyes of the Dominions and the world in general,       We might thus be deprived of support in a       subsequent struggle between Germany.and the       British Empirec  In our view it is hardly an       exaggeration to say that failure to take up such       a challenge would place Germany in a predominant       position in Europe and correspondingly lower our       prestige throughout the worldo  Therefore we       have, as we see it, no choice but to regard a       German invasion of Holland as a direct challenge       to -our security&quot; 0       We endorse these views, and we are of opinion that if germany should invade Holland, this country would haveto regard her action as a ^asus^J^elli, assuming that Hollandresists invasion,.
 5.      There is,  of course,  always  the  possibility  that Holland would not resist  invasion.  We  regard  this  as unlikely;   and we do not  think it profitable to speculate  on what action  should be  taken  if this contingency should arise0 6..     before^e Staff Conversations can be  undertaken to meet  the contingency of a German invasion of Holland, it                          - is  necessary for  a diplomatic  approach  to be made to the French Government*  To avoid delay, we  authorised the Secretary  of  State for Foreign Affairs, without waiting for the conclusion set out in  paragraph 4 to be submitted for the approval  of the Cabinet, to initiate a discussion of  the -matter&apos; with the French  Government0  The Secretary of  State for  Foreign Affairs is accordingly communicating to  the French Government  the disturbing information recently received as  to German preparations for an invasion of Holland,  indicating that on a provisional view,H.M. Government are disposed to take the  view  outlined in paragraph  4, and. that  the whole  question is being-further examined  by PldvL, Government who would  be glad to learn  the views of  the French  Government  on the matters7,      After  discussion of the various  possibilities,we reached the conclusion that  the best course would, bethat the Foreign  Secretary should make  a  simultaneousapproach in the same  general sense to the BelgianGovernment, and we  authorised him to proceed accordingly.
8.     We considered whether any formal approach shouldalso &quot;be made to the Dutch Government at this stage.   Forthe reasons indicated by the Foreign Secretary at the last meeting of the Cabinet (Cabinet 2^39) p.9) we decided thatno formal approach should be made at this stage.   our minister at The Hague hass howevers been instructed todiscuss the position informally with Dr. Colijn on thelines of the suggestion made at the last meeting of theCabinet by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andfor the Colonies (Cabinet 2(39) p.10).9.     In discussion with the French Governments the lattermay suggest that account should be taken, not merely ofa possible German invasion of Hollands but also of apossible German invasion of Switzerland.   The FrenchGovernment may take the view that an invasion by Germany of either of these countries stands on the same footing,, andthat we should undertake &quot;that- if -Germany-invades Swit^ej^Xaxul,,and France thereupon declares war on Germany, we would come to the assistance of France.   We think that, if thisquestion is put, we should be prepared to give anaf firmative-. .ans-wej^jproirided. ^jalways that F-r-suooe undertakes to declare war on Germany in the event of Germanyinvading Holland.Staff Conversations.10.    If the diplomatic approaches to the French and belgian Governments proceed as we anticipate, the nextstep.will be for further Staff Conversations to take place with the French and Belgian Staffs which will result in the
formulation of joint plans to meet the contingency of a German invasion of Holland.   We take this opportunityof pointing out that in our view the joint plans should cover* not merely military operations, hut also the sphere of supplies, in regard to which conversations have heenproceeding on a hypothetical and non-committal basis&apos;.&quot;It must6 of coursec be recognised that the preparation ofsuch joint plans will in fact constitute a far morebinding obligation than has hitherto been contemplated;since the countries with whom these joint plans are.concerted will inevitably place reliance upon our co-operation and will make their own dispositions andarrangements accordingly,11.    We have also taken the opportunity to considercertain outstanding matters in regard to Staff Conversat-ions which were raised in a Report by the Chiefs of Staffdated 18th November last (C.I.D. Paper No, 1486-B) andwhich were discussed by the Committee of Imperial defence at their 340th Meeting held on 1st December., 1938j(Conclusion 3) and at their 343rd Meeting held on 22ndDecembers 1938 (Conclusion 7).12,    Hitherto Staff Conversations with Prance have proceeded on the  basis  of  a  war  against Germanyalone:   .and  our Staffs  have not  been  authorised     M  A case in point is the supply of coal to        Prance.    It has been ascertained that French        requirements in war amount to 20 million tens,        A stage in the discussions with French        representatives has now been reached at which        it is dirTi-oult to carry the discussions further        without entering into any commitments at any rate        by implication,.&quot;^? to the extent to which we        can undertake to meet French requirements in war.

to proceed on. the basis of war against Germanyand Italy in combination.    We recommend thatthe latter basis should be adoptedG    The riskof leakage to Italy cannot be excluded, butwe do not think that the fact that staff conversations were being conducted on this basis would be likely to embarrass ourrelations with italy    In any event, staff conversations on any other basis v/ould losea great part of their value,130   We also recommend that the scope of staff conversations should be extended to include alllikely fields of operations, especially theMediterranean and Middle Bast.14.   As regards the Far East, we think that,while the probability of Japanese interventionagainst us should not be ignored, it should beassumed that Japan would be likely to be influenced by her existing commitments in China,and by fear of Soviet Russia and the United.States of America, and would therefore be likelyto adopt a somewhat cautious attitude, at anyrate at the outset of any emergency in the nearfuture.15,   On the occasion of the visit&apos; paid by thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to Paris in November last, theFrench Prime Minister urged that arrangements should be made by which it might be possible forGreat Britain to despatch two divisions to france at least as early as the eighth day after the outbreak of hostilities  (CP. 269 (38) p.8.),We have invited the Secretary of State for War                -6-

On the occasion of the visit paid by thePrime Minister and. the Secretary of. State forForeign Affairs to Paris in November last, theFrench Prime Minister urged that arrangements should be made by which it might be possible forGreat Britain to despatch two divisions to france at least as early as the eighth day after the out&apos;break of hostilities  (O.P. 269 (38)  p.8.).We have invited the Secretary of State for War                -6-
   to examine further  what  is the  shortest  time   within which our Field Force  contingent   could arrive in France.   16.    Finally,  if as  suggested  in paragraph 10,   joint plans are to  he elaborated with  the French   (and  Belgian) Staffs,  it follows that  it will   be necessary to establish  periodic liaisoni   of a  regular character with the French (and   Belgian) Staffs.   Hitherto we have resisted the   attempts of the French Air Staff to develop such   a  system,  but the steps now proposed necessitate   a  change in our attitude on these matters.   Measures of Acceleration.   17*    We were also authorised to decide, without further   reference  to the Cabinet,  on  any measures necessary  to   put the Defence Services into a state  of readiness to   meet  a possible emergency  in  the near  future.   Our   colleagues  may  wish to know that we authorised the First &apos;  Lord  of the Admiralxcy  to seek The King&apos;s approval to a   change of  plan  v/hereby a liner would be chartered to take   Their Majesties to Canada  and H.M.

We have  heen ashed, by the  Minister for             Co-ordination of  Defence  to report in             accordance with the following terms of  reference:-                    &quot;(l) Whether  the  integrity  of Holland                         constitutes  so  vital  a  strategic                         .jjxi u?j^si--to--this-country that we                         should  intervene  in  the event of                         aggression by Germany agaijast- Holland,                     (2)  If  the answer to (l)  is  in the affirm-                         ative,  what  military action could this                         country take in defence of Holland&apos;s                         integrity:-                            (a) if France and Belgium remain neutraJL;                            (b) if France and Belgium are our allies.&quot;              2.        In Paper No.  CCS. 829  which was circulated              on Tuesday,  the 24th January, 1939, to the Cabinet as              a matter of urgency, we gave our views on Question (l)              above.OK
Li vJ                         In our conclusions to that Paper, we              stated:-                     &quot;We do not feel in a position to submit                         a definite recommendation in favour                         of intervention until we have considered                         what action we could take in present                         circumstances.  This matter will be                         dealt with in our  Second Report, in                         accordance with Question (2) of our                         terms of reference, which will be                         submitt-edjto^                  the                        25th January&quot;.:-W:/ - .i-W:V-V.1                                   1 &quot;V              3.         In this Report, we deal with  our second              terms  of  reference.The Dutch     4.         Navy.   The Dutch  maintain no naval forcesForces.              in Europe capable of offensive operations.   A certain              number of coast ^ef^nce^unxts are-availab-le-for--th-er   &apos;          local  defence-of ports.                         Army.   The Dutch  Army consists  of thirteen              divisions.  It is ill-equipped and inadequately  trained.                         Air Force.  The present strength of the              Dutch  Air Force is such that  she would not  have  aircraft              available for anything more than close co-operation  with              her land  forces.                         General.    Although Holland has begun to              set her forces and defences in order, her traditional role              of neutrality  has impaired  her military  efficiency.
97fj 6The Dutch could at the most,  therefore,.  impose only asmall--measure of delay on a German advance into Holland.Dutch Action  5.in tne eventof a Germanthreat.The DutchPlan.       It must he realised that if Germany determined to overrun Holland, the Dutch would he faced by anirresistible weight of attack.   They might think]therefore, that as resistance would, in the final eventsfail to save them, it would be a wiser course to bowto force ma,jeuret and to avoid warlike action whichcould only lead to widespread destruction in theircountry and great loss of life.   Further, it is possiblethat Nazi propaganda might undermine the Dutch will to re o left *resist.   \ve are unable to estimate the chances of Hollandadopting this course which would presumably mean the endof her existence as an independent power.   If, Hollandwere to acquiesce, even unwillingly6 in German domination,the question of our intervention assumes an entirely different aspect, which is outside the scope of this paper.       In this report we proceed on the assumption thatthe Dutch would offer such resistance to German aggressionas lay within their power.6.     We believe that the present Dutch plan aims atholding the western edge of the Peel in North Brabant,and the line of the River Ijssel, and subsequentlywithdrawing to successive positions while inundations arebeing made to defend &quot;Portress Holland&quot; covering
The GermanPlan.The Actionwhich \?ecould take in defenceof Holland&apos;sintegrity.Amsterdam and Rotterdam,  where the final stand would he made.  The speed with which the inundations can he effect-ed depends upon local conditions of weather, tide, etc.7.         We are unable to forecast with any certaintyGermany&apos;s probable line of action if she intended to-overrun. Holland.  The preponderance of her military strength w.ould enable her to advance into Holland over a wide front with as many divisions as she wished to dispose,supported by overwhelming air action.8.         We turn now to the consideration of the action at sea, on land, and in the air, which we could table  in defence of Holland&apos;s integrity, if we were to intervene,on the assumption:        (a) if Prance and Belgium remain neutralj         (b) if France and Belgium are our allies.(a) France and Belgium neutral.9.         At sea. The Navy could give no direct assist-ance in the defence of Holland  itself.   The fact thatHolland and her territorial waters would no longer beneutral would enable us to apply a greater degree ofeconomic pressure  on Germany.10.On land. A British Field Force of &apos;two divisions would be available, but their passage by sea and their disembarkation in Hollandin face of heavy air and submarine attack by germany would be a most hazardous operation.  Moreover, reinfor^e-ment by a field force of this size  is not likely materiallyto increase the length of time for which the Butch could hold out.  It would probably be only a short time before                     -4--
we should he faced with the problem of withdrawing theforce in still more difficult circumstances.   We donot, therefore, recommend the despatch of the field force to Holland.11.  In the Air.   In the opening stage we could employour bombers from bases in this&quot;country against the german armies invading Holland, and. could, hope to impose some delay on them by attacking their communications andcolumns on the roads.   The effect of this might be enhanced if the German advance can be canalized: by inundationsand demolitions.   The German air forces, however, wouldbe greatly superior in strength to our own;  and. theextent to which we could, continue to employ our bombersin this way must be determined by considerations connectedwith the defence of this country.   The fact of Holland.being in the war would mean that British and Germanbombers were able to fly direct to the attack of objectives in each other&apos;s country.   This, while itconfers certain advantages on both sides, would not affect the immediate issue., the defence of Dutch territory.Conclusions as tonithe , effect of qur^ action  if Franceand Belgium remain neutral.12.   From the above, it will be  seen that nothing wecould do at sea, on land,  or- in the air, could, save Hollandfrom being ultimately or even rapidly overrun by Germany.Nor could any action on our part, materially delay the German  advance.
(b) France and Belgium our allies.13s        At Sea.  Our general naval position would be impro%4but this would not enable any direct naval action to betaken in defence of Holland nor would it accelerate theimmediate effect of the pressure  that the allied naviescould bring to bear on Germany,14.        On Land. We understand that the French and belgians do not envisage, in any  circumstances, thedespatch of troops to Holland,,  Even if they considereddoing so-their forces could not arrive in sufficient timeto secure anything except possibly  &quot;FortressHolland&quot;;.  Moreover-  the German air forces couldsubject the confined area of &quot;Fortress Holland&quot;to such a heavy scale of air attack as mighty inconjunction with other means of pressure,  render ituntenable0  In such circumstances the most effective cours-e^,so far as the British Field Force is concerned,would be  to despatch It to France in accordance with existing plans.Although this would have no effect  in delaying the  Germana&amp;v-ance-oj^Hol^ajacL^^        - ejasnx^.J?-rench^.a.s^i-siance  toBelgium15.        In the Air.  The addition of the French  Air -Force would reduce Germany&quot;s great  relative  superiority in air strength, and might impose some further delay  on  theGerman advance in Holland, The  simultaneous  intervention of England, France and  Belgium  would have the  effect  of drawing  off the German  air attack from Holland to amarked extent.           Our own capacity  to  fly  over Belgium  would increase the scale of attack we could bring  to bear onvital objectives  in Germany, at least  unless the whole
The effect onthe situationif France JLsallied to usbut Belgiumremainsneutral.Conclusion as to the effect of our action with Franceand Belgium as allies.16.        There would still be no hope of  preventing the Germans from overrunning Holland.  Holland&apos;s ultimatefate-would depend upon the later-course of  the war.17.        Although we have not been ashed  to considerthe implications which would arise if Belgium remainedneutral and France intervened on our side, we have thoughtit right, in view of the recent trend of Belgium policy,to make a brief reference to this point.           In our view the action which we  could take andits immediate effect on the defence of Holland remain fuuida-mentally the same&quot; as when both France and Belgium are our allies, put clearly our general position, without the aid of Belgium, would be worse.GENERAL CONCLUSION.18.        In our previous report, (Paper No. CO.S.829)we stated:-       &quot;On purely strategical grounds therefore we         have reached the conclusion that if our prep-         arations were reasonably complete  we should have         no doubt in advising that the  integrity of         Holland constitutes so vital a strategical         interest to this country that we should inter-         vene in the  event of aggression by Germany         against Holland.  The only doubt in our mind         arises from  the present  strength of our         defensive preparations&quot;.19.        Our examination in this Paper of the military action which could be taken  shows that  there is no hopeof preventing Holland being  overrun, and that therestoration of her territory would depend upon the  later
9 920.   Nevertheless, the strategical importance to theBritish Empire of Holland and her colonies is so great that a German attach on Holland must, in our opinion, he regarded as an attack on our own interests.   In Europe,the domination  of Holland would he a first step to givingGermany a great initial advantage in a sub sequent attackon this country.   Overseas the destruction of Dutchauthority in the East Indies would weaken our positionthroughout the Ear East.21.   In our view, our intervention would almost inevitably bring in Italy, and possibly Japan against us.We could not, at the outset, rely on the assistance ofany major Power except possibly Prance.   Even with france as our ally, a war against Germany, Italy and japan would under any conditions impose a very severe strain upon the Empire.22.   If we were compelled to enter such a war in thenear future we should be confronted with a positionmore serious than the Empire has ever faced before.The ultimate outcome of the conflict might well depend upon the intervention of other Powers, in particular of the United States of America.      Nevertheless, as we have pointed out in our first report (paragraph 12), failure to  intervene would have such moral and other repercussions as would seriouslyundermine our position in the eyes of the Dominionsand the world in general.   We might thus be deprived of support in a subsequent  struggle between Germanyand the British Empire,   In our view it is hardly an
