CABINET.                           INDIA.     Appreciation of the Political  Situation,  bythe Government of India, dated  21st December,  1938.     Circulated for the  information of the  Cabinetby the Secretary of State.for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situationin India,  dated the 21st December,  19 38,  issued on   the authority of the Secretary of State for India.     &apos; Payingj,al^Airbonoay  -  At the close of the year 1938it may be of use to summarise the political history of the eleven Provinces under the new constitution.   The electionsheld early in 1937 gave Congress a clear majority over allother parties in the Assemblies of six Provinces.   In twoof the others (Punjab and Sind) the Congress party was negligible in numbers.   In Bengal and Assam it formed thelargest single party, and in the Frontier Province a formidable opposition.   In all five non-Congress ProvincesMinistries were formed at the beginning of April andentered on their duties.   In the six Congress Provincesthe majority party did not assume office, as the demandpresented to each Governor by the party leader for adefinite assurance that he would make no use of the special powers entrusted to him in the Constitution Act was refused;  Ministries were then formed from the minoritygroups.   Early in July, the Congress Working Committee,professing to be convinced that it would not be easy forGovernors to use their special powers, resolved that theparty, might accept office - strictly on the understandingthat it-should combat the Constitution Act on the one handand prosecute the constructive Congress programme on theother.    Within a few days the minority Ministries (whichin the  meanwhile had not faced the legislatures) hadresigned,  and Congress Ministries were in office.   2.     The only item of the Congress programme which has
brought Governors into acute conflict with theirMinistries has been the release of &quot;&quot;political*&apos; prisoners.This was interpreted as requiring the indiscriminate and unconditional release, regardless of consequences, even ofprisoners convicted of serious violence.   In February-last the position was that the Ministries of the united provinces and Bihar were pressing the demand:  the Governor-General on the ground of the grave menace to the peace ofthe country that would be caused if the demand wereconceded, particularly in Bengal where nearly 40C terroristconvicts were still in jail, instructed the Governors to stand firm.   In consequence the two Ministries tenderedtheir resignations.   These were not in fact accepted:  theHigh Command of the Congress, and the other Ministries under its control, had no desire for the demission of office inall the Congress Provinces on this issue:  the Governor-General published a statement explaining the necessity for examination of individual cases before release, whileassuring the Ministries of the Governors&apos; co-operation inthis respect as in others:  and in a few days the Ministersreturned to work.    Though most of the prisoners in thesetwo Provinces were released soon after, the Ministersclaimed to be assured that they had abjured violence.     On a later occasion the Working Committee took strongexception to the designation as officiating Governor ofOrissa of an official serving in that Province, andstatements issued by Mr. Gandhi and the Congress.Presidentthreatened repercussions throughout India if the appointmentwere not revoked.    The Governor then announced that in theinterests of the Province owing to the instability of the
political situation he had teen permitted to withdraw his application for leave.     Apart from these critical occasions the congress ministries have shown a general and growing tendency to proceed with the constructive tasks of administration and legislation, and to leave to others the duty of combatwith the constitution.   3.     The political stability of all the six originalCongress Ministries is firmly established.   Even in bombay, where the majority in the Assembly was narrow,  anfiin the Upper House still narrower, the Government have  hadno difficulty in pushing through their legislation or inobtaining support for their executive policy.   Of theUpper Houses that exist in these Provinces (Bihar, Bombay,Madras and the United Provinces), only that in the united provinces has shewn serious opposition to Ministerialpolicy - and there a joint session of the two Chambersended the conflict in favour of the Ministry.   Though  inthe Central Provinces the original Ministry, after variousadventures, fell to pieces in August 1938. itsdisintegration was caused by ineptitude and internaldissension:  and its successor is equally Congress incomplexion.   Outside these six Provinces, Congress hasextended its influence.   The Frontier Province ministry was the first to fall, in September 1937:  and the Ministrywhich took its place owes allegiance in all essentials  to congress.   In Sind the Ministry resigned in March last:private jealousies among Muslims have enabled the smallCongress party, while not receiving any representation  inthe new Ministry, to impart a Congress tinge to theadministration:  and the Muslim League has failed to assert
its authority in a Province where it might he expected uo  succeed.   In Assam, the Ministry was never happy; in  February  last it resigned and was at once re-constitutedl;hut its  supporters still proved fickle - and in the middleof  September the Chief Minister confessed his inability tocarry  on, and gave up the attempt.   In his place the Hinduleader of the opposition, having obtained permission of theCongress Command to form a coalition Ministry, assumedoffice with  an enlarged Cabinet.   When it became necessaryfor the Ministry to face the Assembly early in December, ano-confidence motion was defeated by the narrow margin of4 votes.   Thus eight Ministries (out of eleven) are nowunder  the domination of the Congress Working Committee.In one other (Sind) the touchstone of a mere living wage(Rs. 500 a month) for Ministers, and the release of a&quot;political&quot;  prisoner (only one could be found), are some indication of Congress influence.     Only Bengal and the Punjab remain.   In the latter the&quot;Unionist&quot; Ministry, nicely balanced with one Sikh, twoHindu  and three Muslim Ministers, and ably led by an experienced  Premier, has given nominal allegiance to the muslim League but has in practice followed steadily a policyanswering to local needs - the settlement of communaldiscord and  the fostering of the interests of agriculturists.The Congress party in this Province is both rent withfaction and, so far as it allows the urban trading andmoneylending interests to set it in opposition to theagrarian programme of the Ministry, out of accord withorthodox Congress professions.   Twenty-one months of powerhave not diminished the stability of the Ministry orproduced unity in the opposition.    In Bengal the Ministry&apos;s
                                                   5.history has not been so fortunate.   Though only one memberof the original Cabinet of eleven has been discarded,  and though a bid for fresh support was made last month by theaddition of two Muslims, the future of the Ministry, whichwas saved from defeat in the Assembly in August only bythe vote of the European group, can scarcely be regardedas assured.   4.     In the six Provinces where the Ministries arepurely Congress, there are only 5 Muslim Ministers to  30non-Muslims;&apos;  even this low proportion exaggerates the muslim share in the administration, since the Hindus hold the Premierships and most &apos;f the important portfolios, andsome of the Muslims would scarcely have attained office butfor the political need of dilution.   Congress is thusrevealed as a predominantly Hindu body.   It is correct,as a general statement, that outside the Congress there areno real political parties over the greater part of british india:  and the communal division of the country has been aggravated by the growing power of the Muslim League,claiming to protect interests threatened by the pretensionsof Congress to speak for the whole pe- pie.   It appears thatif parties, ether than communal, are to arise where Congressrules, it must be by fissure within the Congress itself:and there are in fact indications, particularly whereagrarian and labour grievances are actively exploited, ofa widening rift between the moderates and extremists.   5.   Congress and the States - In February last theIndian National Congress, meeting at Haripura, reaffirmedthe policy of refraining from direct interference in thepolitical affairs of the States.   The resolution, whileclaiming complete independence and unity in democratic
freedom for the whole of India, and demanding fullresponsible government and civil liberty in the States,expressed the inability of Congress in existingcircumstances to work effectively within the Statestowards these ends:  the Congress would extend moral support and sympathy to the struggle for freedom in theStates:  individual Congressmen would be free to renderfurther assistance in their personal capacities:  but theinternal struggle must not be undertaken in the name of theCongress, and the organisations promoting the movementmust be independent of the Congress.   This doctrine was repeated in May last in a resolution of the working committee.   Meanwhile &quot;the struggle for freedom&quot; wasactive in a number of small States bordering the provinces of Orissa and Bombay.   Not only were &quot;individualCongressmen&quot; of British India  (including Vallabhai Patelwhose status in the Congress hierarchy is scarcelycompatible with that description) engaged in fomenting the agitation;  the rill-India Congress Committee, meeting atDelhi in September, condemned &quot;repression&quot; in Travancore,Hyderabad, Kashmir, and the Orissa States:  and the congress ministries of Provinces adjoining States declined to use their statutory powers to prevent agitation being organisedwithin their borders and launched beyond them.    Thesituation has been aptly compared to the.form of &quot;non-intervention&quot; practised in the civil war in Spain.   OnDecember 3rd, Mr. Gandhi in his paper &quot;The Harijan&quot;acclaimed the simultaneous awakening in the States as dueto the &quot;time spirit&quot;:  and declared that there is no half-way house between a total extinction of the States and fullresponsible government.    Professing to have heard arumour that the British Government would go back on the
 statement-&quot;of Lord winter ton in Parliament about the ability  of  the Princes to grant responsible ^government to  their people, he announced that any sueh recantation would  &quot;precipiteite a first-class crisis whose magnitude it  is  difficult to foretell&quot;.   Alluding to stories of excesses committed by the police of States in suppressing agitation,  he claimed that Ministries in the Provinces had the moral right and duty to take notice of gross misrule in  the States, and to advise the Paramount Power on  what should be done.   He then gave warning that the Congress policy of non-interference might be abandoned: in  terms which can only mean that the policy was adopted for lack of power rather than of will, he announced that the Congress would be bound to intervene if its growing influence gave it the strength to do so with effect:  and he  advised  the Princes to &quot;cultivate friendly relations with an organisation which bids fair in the future, not very distant, to replace the Paramount Power - let me hope, by  friendly arrangement.&quot;     This overweening claim was immediately challenged by  the Muslim League;  the executive council published a resolution  which accused the Congress of seeking, not the good of the States subjects but the establishment in the States of an elective system which would enable the Congressunder Federation to obtain a majority in the Central Legislature.   It went on to warn the British Government that yielding to the Congress methods of coercion and intimidation would provoke Muslims &quot;to resort to  the extremist measures in their opposition to such a  position where their most vital interests would stand to be sacrificed.&quot;
 -                                                    8.     The Working Committee&apos;s resolution published on December 14th., repeated the familiar condemnation of repression:   and asserted the right of Congress to protect the people  against the unwarranted use of military or police forces lent by the British  Government to combat the legitimate  demand for responsible government.   Though considerations of prudence  prevent Congress at present from intervening directly and as an organisation in the conflict, the right is  reserved to guide and assist the people of the States, and the Congress must be increasingly identified with them.   But the advice was repeated that persons not belonging to the States should not intervene: and the necessity of non-violence was enjoined.   Whatever the meaning of the involved and equivocal pronouncements  of Congress, the political motive underlying them has been exposed in the blunt phrases of the Muslim League - namely a desire to ensure that Federation shall be made safe for Congress by the requirement of election as the means of appointing States&apos;  representatives to the Federal legislature and it is fair to assume that the policy of encouraging unrest in the States is actuated less by sympathy with victims of autocracy than by a desire to cause such embarrassment to the Rulers as shall induce them to make&apos; terms with the power which can pacify the disturbances it has fostered.     Meanwhile the policy of the Paramount Power has been comprehensively defined in the reply given to a question in the House of Commons on December 16th:   there will be no obstruction to proposals for constitutional advance initiated by Rulers,  but His Majesty&apos;s Government  will bring no  pressure on them to initiate changes:   it is for the rulers themselves to  decide what form of government they
should adopt in the diverse conditions of the States:   theobligations of the Paramount Power extend to protecting the rulers against violence and disorder, and to advising and-assisting them in remedying such legitimate grievances oftheir subjects as may be found to exist.     6.   The Rupee Ratio - It was known that the CongressHigh Command had for some time been dallying with the demand of certain sections of businessmen and politicians for a lowering of the exchange value of the rupee:  and theGovernment found it necessary last June to check speculationby a public and definite announcement that the presentvalue would be maintained in the best interests of thecountry.    The Congress Working Committee have now,  in aresolution passed on December 14th, stated their reasons for making a positive demand that the rate should be lowered fromls.6d. to Is.4d.  - namely that since June the balanceof trade has turned more and more against India, that thepresent  rate has hit agriculturists hard by lowering theprice of commodities produced by them, and that it gives an unfair advantage to imports:   the present rate has been maintained by  large exports of gold which have been injurious to the country and can now only be maintained by contractingcurrency and credit and by further depletion of the gold and sterling resources of-India.    The Government immediatelyreplied  to this demand in a communique which by reference to recent figures of the trade balance and the trend of prices and of the proportion of gold and sterling reserves to the note issue, completely controverted each of the specificgrounds  alleged for it;  the conviction was stated that a lowering of the ratio would cause no appreciable rise in theprices of agricultural products but would immediately raisethe prices of  what the cultivator needs to buy:  it would
 seriously weaken  the  budgetary position  of the Central Government  and the  larger Provincial Governments:  and would benefit  no  one-except the monied  and speculative interests: the Government would  defend the present  exchange value of the rupee  by every means  in  their power, and&apos;were completely confident of  their  ability to maintain it.     If  one can judge from the comments  just emitted by the newspaper which speaks bo-th for Congress and Indian capitalism, the attack on the ratio is not ended.   The article  attributes  the views of Government to a desire to protect  British officers remitting their savings to England and the  interests of  British manufacturers:  and declares that India  is determined to have  a lower rupee, and will get it soon, the  opposition of the- Government notwithstanding.     7.  The special  session of the Central Assembly which began  on November 10th,  ended on  December 12th.   The session was summoned for  consideration.of the Select Committee&apos;s report on the Income  Tax Bill.  So far as the Bill aimed at higher taxation of  large incomes, stopping gaps in the law which  enabled taxation to be evaded, and an easing of procedure in favour of the honest taxpayer, its provisions met with fairly general  acceptance.    The main battle was waged  over certain  clauses of the Bill which were alleged to  discriminate in  favour of British and other non-domiciled residents in India.   The law as it stands taxes income accruing or  arising or received in or brought into British India.-  The Bill proposed to tax also the whole foreign income of domiciled residents in British India,  not merely the income remitted to India.    The  distinction made between domiciled residents and non-domiciled residents,  i..-e.foreigners  in  India, including Europeans and subjects ofIndian States,  was that the  former were  to be taxed on all
                                                 &apos;    11.their income, wherever it might arise;  the latter were tohe taxed on their income which accrued or arose or wasreceived or brought into British India and any income frombusiness, profession or vocation which arose  outside british india whether it was brought in or not.   When it appeared that this clause was unacceptable to the House, includingthe European group which disclaimed a desire for discrimina-tion in favour of British interests, a compromise wasagreed with the principal parties, by the somewhat complicatedprovisions of which the appearance of undue discriminationwas removed and the taxation of income accrued abroad wasrelaxed by the exemption of a certain portion.   The position under the Bill now is as follows:-  Persons who are notresident in British India will pay only on income arisingor received in British India;   persons who are resident butnot ordinarily resident in British India will pay on incomearising in British India and on foreign income brought into british India;   persons who are resident and ordinarily resident in British India will pay on income arising inBritish India and on foreign income as well subject to anexempted amount of Rs.4,500 (about  340).    Ordinaryresidence,has been so defined as to exclude persons who havenot spent a considerable time in the country.    The Bill asamended was then passed without difficulty.    It will now goto the Council of State,  meeting towards the end of January.     8.   The Federal Court.  On December 2nd,  the Federal Courtdelivered its opinion in an important case relating to therespective rights of the Central and Provincial governments to levy certain taxation.  The point of reference was whetherthe Central Provinces Sales of Motor Spirit and LubricantsTaxation Act was intra vires of the Provincial Legislature.The Act levies a tax- on retail sales of motor  spirit and
 lubricants:   and  the main  issue was whether this tax&apos;  is  an excise  on  goods manufactured  or produced  in India  (and therefore  within  the field reserved for the Central Government) or  a  tax on  the sale of goods  (and therefore within the Provincial field).   The Court gave its opinion that  the Act was within the  competency  of  the Provincial Legislature.      9.    Of matters arising  in the month and not  already covered, the labour situation  in  Bengal,  Bihar and the United Provinces  should  be mentioned.    At Cawnpore there are indications  of a  revival of discontent among the mill-workers. In  Bihar,  though  some  strikes  have been settled, the  coalfields are still  affected.    In Bengal,  the number of strikers  in the jute industry is estimated at between 40 and 50 thousand: and there  have been somewhat serious disturbances  in  various places, in one of which three  persons were killed  and about forty  injured.    10.  Economic.   The agricultural situation in the  Punjab, Delhi,  and Ajmer-Merwara,  is worsening owing to continued drought, and sowing for the spring crops  is adversely affected.     Scarcity conditions in the south-eastern  areas of  the  Punjab continue to  be serious.    11.  Waziri stan.  There has been little change  in  the situation  in Wasiristan during the month.    The faqir of Ipi has been living most of the time  in retirement and has now moved to a place  close to&apos;  the Indo-Afghan, border.   The Toril Khel blockade is  still in  force and some  of the leading men of  the  tribe assisted by members  of other Wasir sections have been endeavouring without  success to persuade the  ho stiles to come to terms.   Air action is being taken against a  part of Phitanni country which is being used as a harbourage  by certainWazir and Bhitanni ho stiles who have with them seven  kidnappedHindus.    There have been  a few cases of  sniping and  kidnapping.
