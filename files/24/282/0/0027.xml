The Committee of  Imperial Defence referred the memorandum to the Chiefs of Staff  Sub-Committee for examination  and report.  This report will, I understand, also be before the Cabinet.THE WAR OFFICE,        2,7th January, 1939.L. H.-B.THE  STATE OF  PREPAREDNESS  OF THE  ARMY IN  RELATION                              TO ITS ROLE.                Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.    THE General Staff  have  for some time past  been reviewing the state of    79preparedness of the Army  to  fulfil the  role  allotted to it by His  Majesty&apos;s  GeneralGovernment.                                                                  3285    It will be recalled that on the 23rd March last I  obtained the general approvalof the Cabinet (Cabinet  16  (38)) for a scale  of preparation  more  restricted in scope than had ever previously been  contemplated.  The following  proposals were agreed:     (a) two regular divisions and  one  mobile division,  with  full war reserves of           ammunition ready to embark in 21 days  ;    (b) two regular divisions with  war reserves of  ammunition  at half the scale           of (a), ready to embark in 40 days ;    (c) provision of a  pool  of  equipment and ammunition sufficient  to permit           despatch overseas 4 months after the  outbreak  of  war of a further           two divisions  (regular or Territorial), with war reserves as in (b).    Shortly afterwards I  accepted a reduction of  70,000,000 in the War Officeconspectus, observing:   -  &quot; It must be clearly  understood that if this is adopted it will not be possiblefor two Territorial or Regular divisions or their equivalent to take the field afterthe fourth  month of war  as stated in the  &quot; Role  of the  Army&quot;  paper,CP. 26 (38).*  There  will,  therefore, be no  reserve contingents to support the4 divisions and mobile  division  after they have been despatched abroad, and it isdoubtful whether such support could be ready, so far as the provision  of equip-ment and reserves is concerned, for 12 months or more after the outbreak of war.It would be disastrous to  attempt to send these divisions against a modern enemybefore they are properly equipped.&quot;    The Minister for Co-ordination of  Defence drew attention to this passage inhis report (CP. 99 (38))! to  the Cabinet.* Enclosure to Paper No. D.P. (P). 17.f Enclosure to Paper No. D.P. (P). 25.
    It is not now sought in  any respect  to modify the role  of  the  Army as approved by the Cabinet, but the General Staff wish formally to call attention tothe fact that present arrangements will not permit the Army to meet satisfactorilyor safely the responsibilities it may be called upon to discharge in accordance withits approved role.    I am compelled to ask for the following modifications in the programme:      (i) It has been shown by  experience that the mobile division is not properlyconstituted, and it should be reorganised into two smaller divisions.            Estimated Cost:   5,000,0004    (2) The first two regular divisions of the  Field Force are, within the  sumallotted, cap&quot;aT5Ie of being&quot;equipped for &quot; defensive &quot; warfare only.   The GeneralStaff point out that it is illogical to have a Force which is unequipped to take the counter-offensive.   The  restriction  to a; defensive purpose has left  these  two divisions unprovided with certain  essential  stores,  reserves  and units.   this applies particularly to ammunition.            Estimated Cost:  13,000,000.    (3) The second two divisions of the Field Force not only suffer from therestriction mentioned in (2), namely, that they are being equipped for a defensiverole only, but also from  the fact that reserves and ammunition are provided on.only half the scale required for a defensive role.  This means that if, as approvedby the Cabinet, the two divisions were to embark within 40 days, they would be severely rationed, and recollections  of the shell shortage of the last War showthat this would lead to an unnecessary loss of life and to a public outcry.  It is requested that full scales of reserves and ammunition may be provided.             Estimated  Cost  of  full scale, to  include  conversion to counter-                 offensive role:  11,000,000.    (4) The operations  at  present  being  conducted  in  Palestine,   where18 Infantry battalions are now absorbed, emphasise that there has been a seriousomission to provide proper equipment and  reserves for the kind of contingencieswith which we may be confronted to an even greater degree in war.    No general authority exists to equip any divisions outside the Field  Force.The troops at present in Palestine are actually using equipment borrowed fromthe Field Force, which, of course, could not be done  in time of war.    Authority  is  therefore requested  for  the  equipment of  two &quot;Colonial&quot;divisions, to be formed out of existing non-Field Force  units,  these divisions tohave  a &quot; Colonial&quot;  scale of equipment and reserves.   One of these divisions,with its equipment and reserves, would be kept as a reserve in the &quot; Middle East,&quot;on lines already approved by the Cabinet.             Estimated Cost:   11,000,000.    (5) Apart  from  the  limited  scale  of  peace-training  equipment  already approved, no arrangements have been made to equip any of the divisions of theTerritorial  Army Field Force to support the Regular Army, and the  Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence  (CP. 234 (38)) recently  called attention to thefact that the &quot; . . .  . scale  of equipment for the Territorial Army is, of course,quite inadequate for war purposes &quot; and &quot; .  . . . would not enable the TerritorialArmy  to train effectively  on  embodiment;  still less would it provide  trainingequipment for any additional force which  it might be decided to raise on theoutbreak of war.&quot;   The Minister concluded:  &quot; In my  judgment we  must beprepared  to consider some increases in the scale of  equipment  at  present authorised for the Territorial Army.&quot;   % The figures quoted throughout this Memorandum are approximations only and are subjectto financial review.
    It would be most discouraging to the Territorial Army to  know  that no provision was being made to fit it for the duties which it has undertaken, and authority is requested for:      (a) the provision of war equipment and reserves for 4 Infantry divisions;             Estimated Cost:  , 30,000,000;    (b) the provision of the necessary training equipment for the remainder of           the Territorial Field Army;             Estimated Cost:   11,000,000.    The supply situation makes the present moment a suitable one for raising the above questions, and I trust that my requests may be favourably entertained.
