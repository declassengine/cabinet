Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1939.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 4 (39).CABINET.PALESTINE.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I APOLOGISE sincerely for the great length of the following memorandum.But the  decisions which we have to take on the  Palestine question will  be  so important and are likely to arouse so much controversy that I feel my colleagues will expect me to set out the problem at the minimum length which is compatible with stating the main issues, and I have found it impossible to make the statementshorter.  But  I have inserted a number of cross headings which will enable mycolleagues to omit from their reading  sections  dealing with matters with whichthey are already  familiar.   For instance, the earlier sections merely contain  an account of the promises which British and other Governments have made to jews and Arabs respectively, and of the claims which these two parties base upon thosepromises. The real discussion of the issues on which we have to reach  decisionsdoes not  begin until the section headed &quot;Future Policy.&quot;    I  should  like to add  one other point  to those made in the  memorandumitself.  It relates to the personnel of the British Administration.  The Adminis-tration contains many good officers, but it also contains others who ought to  betransferred  as soon  as possible from  Palestine to work  in other parts of theColonial Empire where the problem is simpler.  Indeed, this is essential  if future policy  in Palestine is to be successfully administered. The High commissioner and I have already given some consideration to this question, and he is  in agree-ment with me upon it.  A member of the Personnel Division in the Colonial office is visiting Jerusalem shortly to discuss the matter in detail,  and, with the advice of Sir Harold MacMichael, whose experience of administration is invaluable, i hope to  improve  considerably the British personnel in Palestine over  the  nextfew months.    Though I am circulating this paper  at once to  the whole Cabinet  for their information, it will be discussed, in the first instance, by the Cabinet Committeeon  Palestine.   The Committee will report upon it to the Cabinet as soon  aspossible.                                                                    M. M.    Colonial Of/ice, January 18, 1939.49THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
MEMORANDUM.    IT must be our hope that in the  forthcoming discussions in London the conflicting claims of Arabs and Jews in Palestine may be resolved by agreement,but I have to admit that the omens are not good.  Many years of increasinglybitter political conflict, punctuated at intervals by murderous outbreaks by theArabs against  the  Jews, and finishing  up with two years  of  sustained Arabrebellion against the Government, have left tempers on both sides sullen, hard anduncompromising.  The prospect of agreement is not hopeless; certain factors suchas a growing recognition that the present position is absolutely intolerable for allconcerned, and the  presence at the London discussions of moderating influenceson both sides (i.e., the representatives of neighbouring Arab countries on the one side, and of non-Zionists on the other), can perhaps be exploited to achieve some sort of understanding.  But it is essential that His Majesty&apos;s  Government shouldbe ready with the broad lines of a settlement which they would announce  andbe prepared  to put into effect forthwith in the event of  a breakdown of thediscussions.  This settlement should represent a compromise which would appealincreasingly to reasonable elements on both sides, and which would be likely atonce to commend itself to public and parliamentary opinion in this country,  andto world opinion, as on the whole just and practicable in the light of our pledgesand of the circumstances that have arisen since those pledges were given.    2.  In this memorandum, after analysing the rights and claims of Jews and arabs, I have sketched in broad outline the kind of settlement which, though itis unlikely to satisfy either party, appears to me to do justice to the realities ofthe situation, and  to be defensible in the light of our obligations and of the reasonable expectations of Arabs and Jews.  Moreover, I would  venture to hopethat a settlement on these lines might provide a basis  upon which, when tempershave cooled, co-operation between Arabs and Jews in Palestine might be founded.    3.  The  High  Commissioner for Palestine has  been  consulted,  and  has expressed the general concurrence of himself  and. his advisers in  these proposals.But I should add  that  he has let  me  know that,  in the event of the Arabrepresentatives not agreeing  to the  proposals regarding  Jewish  immigrationwhich I make in paragraph 52 (B), he would favour  going much further  in thedirection of reducing immigration.                      PROMISES TO  JEWS  AND AKABS.    4.  The  arguments  estimating  the exact weight to be  attached  to ourpromises to Jews  and Arabs  respectively  have  been set forth with eminentfairness by the Peel Commission, and I need not repeat much of what they say.But  it is necessary to recapitulate the  main promises which British Govern-tiients have made to the Jews and Arabs.    5.  Our undertakings to the Jews are founded  upon the Balfour Declaration,which was conveyed in 1917 to Lord Rothschild as  head of the Zionist Organisa-tion  in a letter which contained the following :          &quot; I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s    Government the  following declaration of sympathy with Jewish  Zionist    aspirations, which has been submitted  to and approved by the Cabinet:              &apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government view with favour the establishment in         Palestine of  a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their         best endeavours to facilitate the  achievement of this object,  it  being-         clear ly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the         civil  and  religious  rights  of existing  non-Jewish  communities in         Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other         country.&apos; &quot;     6.  This Declaration was approved before its issue by the American Govern-ment, and later by the French and Italian  Governments.
    7.  After the War this promise to the Jews was embodied in the PalestineMandate.  After repeating the substance of the Balfour Declaration the preamble to the Mandate continues :         &quot; Whereas recognition has thereby been given to the historical connection    of the Jewish people with Palestine  and to the  grounds for reconstituting    their  national home in that country.....&quot;and in due course come the following Articles :                                     Article  2.        &quot; The Mandatory shall be responsible for placing the country under    such  political,  administrative and economic conditions as will secure  the    establishment of the Jewish national home, as laid down in the preamble,    and the development of self-governing institutions, and also for safeguarding    the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective    of race and religion.&quot;                                   Article  6.        &quot; The administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and    position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate    Jewish  immigration  under suitable conditions  and  shall encourage,  in    co-operation with the Jewish agency referred to in Article 4, close settlement    by Jews on the land, including State lands and waste lands not required for    public purposes.&quot;    8.  There are various other Articles &quot;which touch upon  different aspects ofthe development of the Jewish National Home, but the Preamble and Articles 2and 6 contain the main pledges.  I attach a copy of  the whole Mandate to thismemorandum.    9.  We must remember that  this Mandate was endorsed by  more than50 nations at Geneva and blessed by the  United States of America.  In theoryat least we are the agent of this formidable body of world opinion for carryingout the Mandate&apos;s  terms,  and  Zionist influence has succeeded up to now inmaking these nations place  particular emphasis on our obligations  to  the Jewsas distinct from our obligations to the Arabs.   This  is one of the many factorsthat we have to  keep  in mind in considering  the Palestine  problem, for  theadoption by us of any policy which was regarded by the rest of the interestedworld as  a breach of our (and  their)  promises  to the Jews would  undoubtedlylead to international disputings and to charges of weakness against us and serious loss of confidence in our good word.    10.  If the promises that we made to the Jews were rather loosely worded(for  example, what does a  &quot;Jewish  National  Home&quot;  mean?) our  war-timepromises to  the Arabs regarding Palestine were also open to different  interpre-tations, and have led to controversy ever since.   I do not propose to present here the rival arguments about the exact significance of phrases which were used inthe McMahon correspondence with King Hussein. Suffice it to say.  that in thoseofficial documents the British Government promised the Arabs that they would recognise  and support Arab  independence over a vast  part of Arabia a promisewhich has been handsomely carried out since the War  in  Iraq and elsewhere.But a certain area,  defined as &quot; the districts of Mersina and Alexandretta andthe portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts  of Damascus, Horns, Hamaand Aleppo,&quot; was described in Sir Henry McMahon&apos;s letter as not being purelyArab and was  specifically excepted  from the pledge.  (Map No. 1  in the PeelReport  shows these  districts  in  relation to Palestine.)  The Arabs  in Palestine,with the support of their fellows in neighbouring countries, have always  held that palestine  was not in this excluded area, and that our refusal to allow the Arabsself-government in Palestine is a breach of our solemn promise  to the  Arabpeoples.   We have consistently argued  that  Palestine  was  covered by  thephraseology quoted above.  So far as purely legal arguments are concerned, thisserious difference of opinion lies at the root of the controversy between the arabs and ourselves, and is the basis of Arab opposition to the establishment of a JewishNational Home in Palestine.    11.  No doubt  there is room  for considerable  argument as  to whetherPalestine  was or was not included in the area from which self-government was to
 be withheld.  The phrase used was, unfortunately, vague, and it is a thousand pities that, perhaps owing to the exigencies of war, the authors of the McMahon correspondence  did not make it clear to the Arabs beyond any reasonable doubt that Palestine was not to be theirs.   Certainly, the Arab  belief that we intended Palestine to belong to them, and that its withholding was an after-thought, is genuine, and they regard their ownership of it as one of our commitments.   On the other hand,  I believe that it is perfectly true that the British Government of the time did intend to exclude Palestine.   Responsible statesmen of the day have been unanimous in saying so, and Sir Henry McMahon has said so. As the matter will certainly form a subject of discussion when the Arab representatives come to London, the Foreign Office are circulating separately some notes upon it as well as upon other legal  aspects of the Arab case.     12.   But we have some obligations to the Arabs of Palestine which are not in dispute.  The Balfour Declaration -itself provides that  nothing is  to  be done &quot;which might  prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing  non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&quot;   Under the terms of the Mandate we have undertaken to  develop  &quot;self-governing  institutions&quot; and  to  &quot;safeguard  the civil  and religious  rights  of  all the  inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race  and religion&quot;  (Article  2); and  to ensure  that  &quot;the  rights  and  position of other (i.e., non-Jewish) sections of the population are not prejudiced &quot;  by Jewish immigration or  land settlement (Article 6).     13.  On these various undertakings, or on interpretations of them which have been made from time to time, the Jews and the Arabs base their rival claims and demands.                              JEWISH CLAIMS.     14.  On the one  hand,  the  Jews demand the complete  fulfilment  of  the Balfour Declaration, and claim that  this  involves :-  (a) Acceptance of the principle that all Jews enter Palestine as of  right.     This  claim  is based on  a passage in the Preamble to the Mandate  which reads         &quot; Whereas  recognition has  thereby  \_i.e.,  by the Balfour Declaration]     been given to the historical connection of the Jewish  people with Palestine     and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country,&quot;and on the  following passage in Mr. Winston churchill&apos;s Statement of Policvof June, 1922 :-        &quot;But in order that this  community [i.e.,  the  Jewish  community in     Palestine] should have the best prospect of free development and  provide     a  full opportunity for  the Jewish people to display its  capacities, it is     essential that it should  know  that it is in  Palestine as  of  right and  not     on sufferance.   That is  the reason why  it is necessary that the existence     of a Jewish national home in Palestine should be internationally guaranteed     and that it should  be  formally recognised to rest  upon ancient  historic     connection.&quot;     We cannot accept the contention that all  Jews as such have a right to enterPalestine.   Such a principle is not  a corollary of recognition  of the historicalconnection of the Jews with Palestine, and  the passage quoted from Mr. Churchill&apos;sStatement of Policy implies no more than that the Jews who have already entered,or might be  allowed to enter, Palestine are or would be in that country as of right;  that is to  say, that they are the equals in national status of the indigenousinhabitants.  It would clearly be absurd  to admit that all the millions of jews in the  world have a  right, which they should be allowed to exert if they wished,to settle in  Palestine.(b)  An obligation on our part to facilitate Jewish immigration and the settle-       ment of Jews on the land up to  the limit  of the economic absorptive       capacity of the country, regardless  of other considerations.     This claim is based on the Churchill White Paper of 1922 and on the letter which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald sent when he was Prime Minister to Dr. Weizmannin February, 1931.   Actually Mr. Churchill only laid down that  &quot;immigration
cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacityof the country at the time to absorb new arrivals.&quot;  But it is a fact that since1922  Jewish immigration  has  been regulated by the economic  criterion  alone(the Immigration Ordinance and Regulations being so framed  as to give  effectto  that  principle), and that  in his letter  to  Dr.  Weizmann  Mr.  ramsay macdonald observed that &apos;&apos; the considerations relevant to the limits of absorp-tive capacity are purely economic considerations.&quot;  Therefore, though the Mandateitself only obliged  us  to facilitate Jewish immigration &quot;under suitable  con-ditions,&quot; v/e have since officially interpreted the obligation as one to facilitateimmigration up to  the economic absorptive capacity of the country.  The jews would regard  any permanent departure from  this principle as a repudiation ofan  interpretation  of our obligations  under  the  Mandate  which had  been sanctioned by  the long practice and formal pronouncement of previous Govern-ments; and the members of the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Leagueof Nations have shown that they sympathise with this Jewish view.   The presentspecial restrictions on Jewish immigration involve a departure from the acceptedprinciple of economic absorptive capacity and  we have defended them in Parlia-ment  and at Geneva as being of a  temporary nature only.  The Jews maintain that if  this established  principle of  economic absorptive  capacity  were firmlyadhered  to at  least another million Jews could settle in  Palestine over a periodof years, and  they  claim that  the country could rescue  almost at once 100,000Jewish refugees from the horror of Central Europe.    The firm  Jewish belief that at least  another 1,000,000 Jews can be settled in Palestine over a period of years leads them to look forward to a time  whenthey will be the dominant power  in the land.   They  therefore attach  greatimportance to  their final claim which  is (c)  The rejection of any constitutional change which would  place the Jews in      Palestine in the  position of a  minority (whatever minority rights might      be guaranteed) under an  independent Arab  Government.  The Zionist      Jews would claim in addition that the  fulfilment of the Balfour Declara-      tion involves eventually the actual creation of an independent Jewish State      covering the whole  of Palestine.    This claim is based on (i) the use  of the word &apos;&apos; National&apos;&apos; in the expression&quot; Jewish National  Home,&quot;  (ii) the fact that the  Balfour Declaration purported to be a &quot; declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations,&quot; and that theBritish Government of  the day were well aware that Zionist aspirations werefundamentally &quot; nationalistic,&quot; (iii) the wording of the Preamble of the Mandate,which recognizes &quot; the historical connection of the Jewish people with palestine and the ground for reconstituting their national home  in that country,&quot; and (iv)the evidence given to the Peel Commission by Mr. Lloyd George and statements made by President  Wilson, General Smuts, Lord Robert  Cecil, Lord  Samuel andMr. Churchill between  1917  and  1920,  which  indicated  that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment definitely contemplated the possibility of the eventual establishmentof a Jewish majority in Palestine and of a Jewish  State there.  The followingquotations will give an indication of the strength of this latter claim.  Mr. LloydGeorge, giving evidence  before  the Royal Commission, said : .         &quot; The idea was, and this was the interpretation put upon it at the time,    that a Jewish  State was not to be set up immediately by the Peace Treaty    without reference to the wishes of the majority of the inhabitants.  On the    other hand, it was contemplated that when  the time arrived for  according    representative institutions to Palestine, if  the Jews had meanwhile responded    to the opportunity afforded  them by the  idea of  a  national home and had    become a definite majority of the inhabitants,  then Palestine  would  thus    become a  Jewish Commonwealth.&quot;    President Wilson, on  the 3rd March, 1919, said :          &quot; I am persuaded that the Allied nations, with the fullest concurrence    of our own Government and people, are agreed that in Palestine  shall be laid    the  foundations of  a Jewish commonwealth.&quot;     General  Smuts,  speaking  at  Johannesburg  on  the  3rd November,  1919,foretold an increasing  stream  of Jewish immigration into  Palestine  and &quot; ingenerations to come a great Jewish State rising there once more.&quot;
                               ARAB CLAIMS. -     15.  The Arabs, on the other hand, put forward equally far-reaching claims which are in flat contradiction  to  these  Jewish claims.  Although  there  are different factions within  the Arab movement in Palestine, these divisions  arechiefly to be explained  by family  rivalries, and  they do  not represent anyfundamental differences  amongst the Arabs regarding political policy.   TheNashashibi  faction is perhaps  more moderate in some ways than the Husseinifaction (at the head of which is the Mufti of Jerusalem); but they are equallyvehement with the others in their  opposition  to  the whole of our  policy  of introducing the Jews, and it would be a mistake to suppose that, at any rate atpresent, it would be possible for  &apos;&apos; moderate &apos;&apos; Palestinian Arab leaders to takea less uncompromising line than that adopted by the more extreme leaders.  TheArabs generally have been consistent throughout the last twenty years  in urging the following claims :      (a) The right of the Arabs to complete independence in their own land.     They base this claim on their interpretation  of the McMahon correspondenceof 1915, which came earlier than the Balfour Declaration of 1917, and, in their view, cannot be replaced by it. They support the claim by quoting various authori-tative statements made on behalf of the Allied and Associated Powers during andafter the War.  For instance, they refer to one  of  President Wilson&apos;s FourteenPoints which declared &quot; The Turkish portions of the present  Ottoman  empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are nowunder  Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted  security of life  and  an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development,&quot; and to the Anglo-French Declaration of the 7th November, 1918, which stated &quot; The object aimed at by France and Great Britain .... is the complete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks, and the establishment of national govern-ments  and administrations deriving their  authority from the initiative and freechoice of the indigenous  populations.  In order to carry out  these intentionsFrance and  Great Britain are at  one in encouraging and assisting the establish-ment  of  indigenous   governments   and  administrations  in   Syria*  and mesopotamia.&quot;  Another example of  this  form  of  Arab argument  is  that article 22  of the  Covenant  of  the League   of Nations  contemplates  thegrant of independence to  the Arab people  of Palestine as comprising one of the&quot;communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire which have  reached a stage  of  development  where their  existence as independent  nations  can  be provisionally recognised,&quot; and  that the Mandate for Palestine, which is of  the&quot; B &quot;  type,  conferring full powers of administration on  the  Mandatory,  isultra vires this Article of the Covenant.     The Arab, representatives  in London  will press this claim  as hard as theycan.  They will ask that the Mandate should be brought to an end,-and a treatynegotiated between Great Britain and the  Palestinian Arabs on the lines of our treaty with  Iraq, establishing  a  sovereign Arab State in Palestine, with safe-guards for British interests and guarantees for the minority rights of the Jews.     (b) The experiment  of establishing a Jewish National Home in  palestine should be brought to an end.     What the Arabs in Palestine are afraid of is that Jewish immigration (whichhas  already established  in the country a Jewish population of some 411,000, ascompared with an Arab population of 1,004,000) will continue until the Jews are so numerous and powerful that, with their superior industry, ability and wealth,they do in effect rule the  land, either through the definite creation of a jewish state or else simply by the fact of their  influence.  They are anxious that anyfurther growth of the Jewish National Home should be checked.  In general theyare  now reconciled to  the 411,000 Jews  who are  already settled in  Palestineremaining there.  Those of them who realise that it is no longer practical politicsto expect the abolition of the idea of a Jewish National Home will plead that theHome should not be a Jewish State or a political entity of any kind, but that  itssignificance  for the Jewish people of the world should be cultural and spiritual.They will argue that in Palestine there would be a considerable Jewish  popula-tion enjoying the full rights of a*civilised minority, keeping alive  through  the               * Syria was then generally understood to include Palestine.
                              THE CONFLICT.    16.  Thus the conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine is direct.  It isin the nature  of  a head-on  collision;  and no one  who  studies  the  problemimpartially and with understanding can fail to feel considerable sympathy with both sides.  This is not a controversy in which one side is largely right and theother side largely wrong.  Each party has a great deal of right on its side. ThePeel Commission described the situation between Jews and Arabs as &quot; a conflict of right  with right.&quot;  The Jews were undoubtedly led by British  statesmen in1917 and the immediately following years to believe that the Government would facilitate their  developing Palestine until, if they could secure a majority of thepopulation, this people without a country would at last have a sovereign state of&apos;their own.  The immigration  and development which have  in fact  taken placehave done no economic harm to the Arabs in Palestine; on the contrary, the arab population has  increased in numbers and well-being.  By all Jewish calculations(with which we are bound up to a point, I think, to agree) there is still considerableroom for further Jewish immigration; and at the present moment the need for anearly refuge for large numbers of Jews from persecution in other countries is more urgent than it has been for generations past.     17.   On the other hand,  the Arabs of  Palestine and beyond believe that a promise of self-government in Palestine was made to them by the British Govern-ment during the war.   They  urge that Palestine was not  ours to  give away toany  foreign  people.  They were  not parties to the international pledge that a jewish National Home should be  established there, and the unwilling PalestinianArabs now see the country in which they have lived for  countless generationsinvaded  by a more or less alien people who are far more industrious and wealthythan  themselves, and who threaten to dominate them  economically, socially and politically.   At the  same time as this fate of falling gradually under Jewishdomination seems to  stare them in the face they  see their fellow-Arabs in neighbouring countries (whom they do  not regard as in  any way superior to themselves) enjoying an ever  greater measure of that self-government  to whichthey think themselves entitled.     18.   All this is very  unsatisfactory,  and we cannot avoid blame for thesituation which has arisen.   It is impossible to escape the conclusion  that theauthors  of the various declarations made to Jews and Arabs during  the war,which are really very difficult to  reconcile, were rather confused about the wholebusiness. T doubt whether they realised fully how  many Arabs  were alreadyliving in Palestine at the time when they made their promise to the Jews; theycertainly cannot have  foreseen  how formidably  that. Arab  population would increase  after  the  arrival  of  Jewish  capital and   development  and british administration; and they must have assumed in any case that these Arabs couldbe persuaded to acquiesce in the  policy  of the Jewish  National Home.  Inmitigation of this last error of judgment it must be remembered that; at one. time there did appear a prospect of accord between Jews and Arabs, for  early in 1919an Agreement  was  reached between Dr. Weizmann  and the Emir (afterwardsKing) Feisal on the basis of the Balfour Declaration.  But the conditions on whichthe Emir accepted this were not  carried out (through no fault of the Jews), andthe Agreement was never confirmed by Feisal or accepted by the Arab world.&apos;Hebrew University and other institutions Hebrew literature and arts, speakingthe Hebrew tongue, and practising  around their own Holy Places  the  Jewishreligion.  It would be a centre of Jewish inspiration in which Jews  all over theworld could feel a pride and to which they could pay visits.   - There follows from this conception the next Arab claim, which is that     (c)  Jewish immigration and land-sales to Jews should be stopped completelypending the negotiation  of the treaty referred to in (a) above.    In effect this means that Jewish immigration and land-sales would be stoppedcompletely for an indefinite period, for it is  impossible to suppose that if theArabs  gained control of  policy  in Palestine  they would give the slightestencouragement to a Jewish penetration to which they are so bitterly opposed,and of which  they are mortally afraid..
s    19.  It is idle to consider whether a more gradual carrying out of the balfour declaration policy  in  the past could have  avoided the present disastrous andextremely baffling  situation.  I  very much doubt whether any  differences  ofadministration within  the terms of the Mandate would have avoided an eventualclash between  the  forces  of a  persecuted, desperate,  brilliantly  constructive-Jewry in Palestine  and of the widespread Pan-Arab Movement which is rallyingto the defence of its weakest brethren, the Arabs of Palestine.                              FUTURE POLICY.    20.  If the discussions in London result in some basis of agreement, the termsof which would be satisfactory  to us, the Jews  and  the  Arabs, well and good.But the odds are at present very heavily against that.  However, failure to findsuch an agreement in these discussions would not mean that the discussions wereuseless and had achieved nothing.  They would represent an attempt to settle the major Palestine problems by the consent of both parties;  and, even if that attemptfails, it may have paved the way for further attempts later on.  In the end,  bytactful perseverance in this policy, we should succeed in getting the two parties together.  The  logic of events in  Palestine demands that they should co-operate.I hope that the discussions in London will at least achieve some informal meetings between Jewish and Arab leaders which will be the beginning of somewhat better relations between the two peoples.    21.  But after the discussions we shall probably have to settle policy on ourown responsibility,  and to make an early announcement of that policy so that thepresent uncertainty is brought  to an end and our future objectives are more clearly defined.  No doubt our final decision will be  considerably influenced  by what transpires in the  discussions themselves, and by the degree to which we maydiscover that the Jews and  Arabs themselves are prepared  to compromise.  Butat the outset of the discussions we should have our own clear idea of what wouldbe a just and workable solution to the present problem, and endeavour to lead thediscussions in  its direction.   In determining this  solution we must exercise aperfectly impartialunderstanding of the case for each side in the dispute, and beas fair as possible  to each;  we must keep  in mind and endeavour  to fulfil theBritish Governments and the League of Nations&apos; promises to  both parties; andwe cannot forget our own British interests in the Near and Middle East, for theseare of great importance  in world politics  to-day.                   ..  . -    22.  With regard to the solution, I  would make the following  observationsand suggestions :                     A. Constitutional Status of Palestine.    First,  neither the Jewish claim  for the creation at some future  date of a jewish State covering the whole of Palestine nor the Arab claim that the country should become an Arab State can be admitted.    23.  I will deal with the Jewish claim first.  Personally, I have for some years past felt considerable sympathy  with the Zionist desire to found a Jewish state in Palestine.   No one who  contemplates  the misfortunes of the Jews scattered over a score of countries to-day can fail to wish that this people could once morehave  a State of their own, and  in some ways Palestine is the obvious place forthem.  The Arab peoples generally have been treated generously since the war;over the greater part of Arabia they enjoy self-government; Palestine was a smallstrip of  undeveloped country which given guarantees of the sanctity of the moslem Holy Places they could well spare; and the Palestinian Arabs are reallyrather a poor lot of  people.   The conception of a modern  civilisation under Jewishinspiration blossoming on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean is a fine one.Moreover, if one could assume that this small Jewish State could be created withthe acquiescence of the Arab world,  it would be a much needed reinforcement tothe protection of our own interests in the Mediterranean and  beyond.  I cannotconceive  of any time in  the next few generations when a Jewish State sprungfrom our Balfour Declaration would not be  on our  side in case of trouble.  Itcan be argued that a considerable Jewish  population in Palestine would produce a disciplined army  and be provided with wealth and industrial capacity for war production in that strategic corner of the world  which would be an added source of strength to us in case  of war.
    24.  But the present situation is such that we should, in my opinion, make itclear that we do not contemplate now or in the future turning Palestine into a jewish State unless at some future date both the Arab and the Jewish peoplesin Palestine wish  this change  to take place.   Such a  declaration would beeminently just.  Arab detestation of the Jewish invasion into Palestine beingwhat it is, it would be wholly wrong to suggest that this large Arab population should one day in their own native land and against their  will come under the rule of the  newly-arrived Jews.   Such Jewish anger as might  be roused  by apublic  declaration of  this nature would not upset its essential justice; and thedeclaration  would have a reassuring effect on the Arabs,  whose chief fear  isdomination by the Jews.    25.  Nor would such a declaration conflict with any promise that british governments have made to  the  Jews.   The Balfour Declaration  speaks of theestablishment of a &quot; Jewish  National Home,&apos;&quot;&apos; and the Mandate repeats the samephrase.  Subsequent official statements of policy have all employed that term, andnever gone beyond it.   The term does not involve the eventual establishment of a jewish  State,  though it also does not  preclude it.  If we now make an official statement in the sense  suggested, there would be no contradiction  of the balfour declaration, but a modification of it to  the extent that something which was notprecluded in it before was  now being  made dependent on  Arab  consent.   Wewould be giving closer definition, as a result of twenty years&apos;  practical experience,to what we mean by a  &quot; Jewish  National Home &quot; and it is high  time that thisvague and dangerous term did receive further  definition.    26.  It is true that statesmen  who shared responsibility for the balfour declaration have made public statements to the effect that  they looked forward to the creation, in certain circumstances, of a Jewish State in Palestine, and thatthe Jewish  leaders of the time  understood that  this was a possibility.   But,.important though these statements are, it seems  clear that they  were based onassumptions which so far, at any rate, have proved to be incorrect, and which looklike remaining incorrect for as far as we can see into the future.  For example,they must have assumed that the Arab  population of Palestine not to mention the Arab peoples  of  surrounding countries would become reconciled W- andacquiesce  in, the policy of the Balfour  Declaration. That expectation has beenfalsified in  the grimmest manner.  Again, they clearly intended  that a jewish state should only be established  if and when, as a result of  Jewish immigration,the Jews in Palestine formed a majority of the population of the whole country.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s statement quoted in paragraph 14 (c) says this in so  manywords.  Some of them even  seem to have anticipated that this might happen inthe not too  distant future.  But, in fact, although well over 300,000 Jews havesettled in Palestine since 1920,  increasing the total Jewish population to some411,000 souls, the Arab  population in  the  same time has  increased by a still greater total, from a little over 600,000 to  1,004,000, and this enlargement hasbeen achieved almost entirely by natural increase and not by the immigration ofnew Arabs.    27.  But I think it is also necessary to reject the Arab  claim  that palestine should become a sovereign Arab State, like Iraq, in which the Jews would  be guaranteed minority rights.   I will deal first with the position which the Arabsseek to establish by quoting  various pledges given by Allied  statesmen during orimmediately after the War.  These have been set forth in paragraph 15 (a)above.   With regard to the  quotation from  President Wilson&quot; s Fourteen Pointspublished in January 1918 and the reference to the Anglo-French  declaration ofNovember 1918,  it must be remembered that the  American, French and british governments had already endorsed the Balfour Declaration,  so that these generalstatements must  be read as qualified  by that particular  Declaration.  Withregard to the Arab claim that Article 22 of the  Covenant  of  the  League  ofNations contemplates  the grant of independence to  the Arab people of Palestineas comprising one of the &quot; communities formerly belonging to the Turkish empire which have reached a stage of development where their existence as independentnations can be provisionally recognised,&quot; and  that the Mandate  for Palestine.which  is  of the &quot; B &quot; type, conferring full  powers of administration on  theMandatory, is ultra vires this Article of the  Covenant, it  must be rememberedthat the Covenant of the League was drawn up by these same Allied Powers (andothers)  who had  associated themselves in 1917 with  the Balfour Declaration.
Therefore any interpretation of Article 22 which would preclude the fulfilment ofthe Balfour Declaration must also be ruled out.  With regard to this aspect ofthe situation,  the Peel Commission have summed up the position as follows :      (a) The provisional recognition of &quot; certain communities formerly belonging           to  the Turkish Empire&quot;  as-independent nations  is permissive; the           words  are  &apos;&apos;  can  be  provisionally recognised,&apos;&apos;  not  &apos;&apos; will &apos;&apos;  or           &quot;shall&quot;;    (&amp;) the penultimate paragraph of Article 22 prescribes that the degree of           authority to be exercised by the Mandatoiy shall be defined, at need           by the Council of the League;  and    (c) the acceptance by the  Allied Powers and the United States of the  policy           of the  Balfour Declaration made it clear from the  beginning that           Palestine would have to be treated differently from Syria and Iraq,           and  this  difference  of treatment  was  confirmed  by the  Supreme           Council of the League in sanctioning the Mandate.Annoying  though it may  be to the Arabs of Palestine to find themselves treateddifferently from their fellows in neighbouring countries, it must be concludedtherefore that their unqualified claim to independence cannot be  accepted on thearguments which they base on the above quotations.    28.  In addition, there are various practical reasons why it  is impossible to contemplate the establishment of an Arab State as  the solution  of  the problem.The Palestinian Arabs  themselves have scarcely the  capacity to assume responsi-bility for the  government of a country where such difficult problems would arise,and their willingness to accord in practice to a large Jewish minority whom theydislike so  intensely proper minority  rights must be doubted.  The Jews  wouldstrenuously resist  being put in any such position.   The tragedy of  the Jews isthat they have no country of  their own;  they are a minority in every territory in which they live.  They have been going to Palestine with the hope that thereat least they would enjoy equal rights with other members of the community, thatthey would get away from the whole atmosphere of minority status, and that theywould one day even become a majority of the population and enjoy a status equalto that of any other free people  on Earth.  That the Jewish National Home inPalestine  should  now  become  a place  where  they were  a formal minorityguaranteed certain rights, and in which they were ruled over by an inferior people,would  be  intolerable  to  them,  and contrary to  the spirit of  the balfour declaration.  It would be the more intolerable to the  Jews because of their knowledge that their arrival in Palestine, their importation of capital and theirprogressive activities there have been the main stimulus to the greater prosperity of Arabs as well as of  Jews in the country.  In fact, the large Jewish minority in Palestine would not consent to be ruled by an  Arab minority.   They wouldadopt, I believe, a  policy  of non-co-operation;  they  would refuse to pay taxes tothe central authority, and government without their willing support would be embarrassed in  the extreme.     29.  I feel certain, moreover, that a policy of  handing the  Jews over, to be governed  as  a  minority  in an Arab State would  be strongly  opposed  by  the Permanent Mandates Commission at Geneva, as well as by very influential opinion which is in a position  to put strong pressure on the  Government in the United States of America.  In fact, apart from other considerations, this Arab proposal is not practical politics.     30.  The rejection of their claim to independence will be very disappointing to  the Arabs.  But they must be already expecting  this rejection, at any rate as an immediate prospect, for in our Statement on Palestine, published  on the 9th November,  we declared  that, following the breakdown of the scheme for Partition, &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government will .... continue their responsibility for the government of  the-whole of Palestine.&quot;  And Arab disappointment will be tempered by relief at our assurance  that we  do not contemplate making Palestine a Jewish State, just as Jewish disappointment at the latter declaration will be offset to some extent by the  assurance that they are not to come under the rule of an Arab majority.   Of&quot; course, we should keep the door open to the possibility that in totally different circumstances at some  future time either the Arabs or the Jews in Palestine would become reconciled to being citizens  in a
State in which the other party were the predominant partner, and our declarationagainst the establishment of either  a  Jewish or an Arab State should include some qualifying phrase to cover this possibility.    31.  If we thus reject the proposals that either the Jews or the Arabs should govern,Palestine, we do not thereby exhaust the question of what  part the jews and the Arabs in Palestine should take, under our superior Mandatory authority,in the government of their  country.  Article 2 of the Mandate imposes on us theobligation  to  develop  &quot; self-governing institutions.&quot;   Hitherto,  whenever wehave tried  to  carry out  this. obligation by  proposing  a Legislative Council onwhich  Jewish  and Arab  representatives should sit  together,  we  have  beenthwarted either by Arab opposition because Jewish representation was too largeor by Jewish opposition because it was  too small.  But we  must do somethingas soon as  possible  to carry out this obligation, and to satisfy the desire of theArabs  and the Jews for some  measure of self-government.   Before I consider and make proposals on this point,  I  will, however, discuss certain  other matters,and especially the question of Jewish immigration, which lies at the root of the troubles and difficulties in Palestine, and on  which it is necessary  to make up our minds before proceeding to consider other aspects.                              B. Immigration.    32.  The  problem of Jewish immigration  lies at the root of  the difficultiesin Palestine.  The  Jews urge  that the only limit to it should be the economicabsorptive  capacity of the country,  irrespective of political  or other considera-tions;  and their  view of Palestine&apos;s power to  absorb new workers in fields and towns is a  rosy one.  In fact,  they  are firmly  convinced  that at least a millionadditional   Jews  could  settle  in   Palestine during  the  next   few  years without  any harm to,  and  indeed  to the advantage of, the  existing  Jewishand Arab populations.  They urge that any reduction  from this sort of figure isby so much a modification of our solemn obligation  under the Balfour declaration and subsequent official undertakings.     33.  The Arabs, on the other hand, have been  consistently opposed to jewish immigration,  and  their  main  demand  now  is  that immigration should  be completely  stopped.    34.  The Jews argue, and  firmly believe that they are right in arguing, thatthis  Arab  opposition  to immigration is  largely fostered by  interested  Arabpoliticians, that it is not really felt  by the great majority of Arab fellahin, whohave benefited from the development which has come in the  wake of the Jewishpenetration into  Palestine, and that the apparently widespread  Arab hostilityis to a large  extent bluff.  If  the British Government would only be firm incarrying out the Mandate (say  the Jews) Arab hostility would collapse.   whilst the Government remains uncertain, whilst it hesitates, the Arabs naturally con-tinue their game of bluff; but face these Asiatics  with a decision, and they will accept it with as good grace as may be.    35.  This view is shared by a great many people  in  this country, includingmany  members of  Parliament who  are  vocal  in  debates  on  Palestine  inParliament.    I   can   only   say   that   I   think   this  argument   is  nowprofoundly untrue, that anyone who does continue  to believe in  it  is  guilty of  a  major  error of  judgment,  and  that to frame  policy  on  any  suchassumption would  be  disastrous  to  all prospect  of peace  in  Palestine fora long time to come.  The hostility of the Arabs inside  Palestine against the Jewshas become deep and widespread;  for instance, rebellious  activity  in Palestine isnow being  sustained very largely by the Palestinians themselves without outsidehelp. We may crush this opposition  by force, but afterwards we shall only be ableto keep it down by  force.  That will not be good for our reputation.   Nor  can Ibring myself  to believe  that it would be right.  Indeed, I  think  it would be contrary to the spirit and the intention of the  Mandate system itself and to articles 2  and 6 of the Palestine  Mandate  in  particular, which bind us to haveproper  regard to the &apos;&apos; civil and religious rights &apos;&apos;  and to  the &apos;&apos; rights and position&quot;  of the  non-Jewish   population  of Palestine.   We cannot treat  amillion Arabs in their own country as though they did  not exist; we cannot adoptthe attitude that the opinions of this particular set of human beings, unlike those
of any other set, count for exactly nothing at all.  If they have any &quot;rights,&quot;one of them surely is that, on a matter touching them so closely and regardingwhich they have such strong views, their opinions should be treated with respect.    36.  So much for the Arabs in Palestine.  But that is not the whole of the story.  As my colleagues are fully aware, our present policy regarding jewish immigration into Palestine has enlisted support for the Palestinian Arabs fromthe Governments and peoples of Egypt and of Saudi Arabia,  Iraq, Trans-jordan and other Arab countries. I think that some people exaggerate the extent to whichthis is at present likely to place  these countries amongst our  enemies insteadof amongst our friends in case of war. - It was remarkable that during the inter-national crisis last September, when the unpopularity of our Palestine policy was at its height, the Governments of  Egypt and Iraq did not hesitate to assure us of  their full support  in case of  trouble,  with  scarcely  any  mention of  theembarrassing  situation in Palestine.   King  Ibn  Saud also has  shown over andover again how suspicious he is of German and Italian ambitions in the Near and middle East, and how firmly he recognises that his interests are best served byfriendship with Britain  It would take a lot to make these countries adopt anyother attitude.  Nevertheless, we  cannot  ignore  the repeated warnings of  our representatives in that part of the world, and the strength of feeling of the Arabpublic generally against our  Palestine  policy  is making  it more and  moreimpossible for their rulers to maintain a  pro-British attitude.   Certainly  if we continue a policy in Palestine  which arouses the strong resentment of the sur-rounding countries our position in that important part of the world will become more precarious.  We shall be playing into the hands of those Egyptian and Arabpoliticians who are our enemies; the situation will be cunningly exploited to ourgrave disadvantage by the propaganda of those in Europe who are hostile to us;and, the relationship between Jews and Moslems being what it is, the issue might easily become one in which in a crisis  good Moslems were successfully called uponto wage a Holy War against us.  The Arabs showed in the last war that they arenot a people to be ignored.    37.  But in any case, apart from the possibility of this  trouble in an inter-national crisis, if our  future policy in Palestine  causes continued resentment inthe surrounding countries, the authorities  in these countries will find it more andmore difficult and distasteful to restrain their nationals from giving financial and physical help  to the rebellion (which would  presumably continue)  in Palestine;and our  task in suppressing violence would become much more formidable.    38.  It would be hard to conceive of anything more damaging to our prestigethan the loss of  the sympathy and friendship of the Moslem  world, which we now enjoy.  Amongst other considerations, it would seriously complicate matters for us in India.  This  genuine,  widespread Arab opposition  to our policy inPalestine is a fact  to which we must pay most careful heed, and it seems to methat the time has come when we should alter radically our outlook on the palestine problem.    39.  Hitherto  British  Governments  and  Parliaments  have tended  to  becarried away, not simply by the tireless and clever propaganda of the Jews infavour of their great experiment  in  Palestine,  but also by  genuine enthusiasmfor the conception  of a new Jewish civilisation in Palestine and by admirationfor the astonishing achievements of  Jewish  money and settlers  during  the  lastfifteen years in  that  rather barren  land.   I share that  enthusiasm a,nd thatadmiration.  I do not write as an opponent of  Zionism, but as  a  friend, and I say deliberately that we have paid too little heed to the rights of the Arabs ofPalestine.  We have been inclined to ignore them as a poor, weak people of whom we need not take very much notice.   Let  us  be fair to the Jews, but let us also give these Arabs fair treatment.  I would regard  the wishes and claims of theJews and Arabs as the wishes and claims of  two peoples equal in status, neither of whom is subordinate to the other in right.    40.  From the point of view of proper political morality,  as well as of ourown interests in the Near and Middle East, it is necessary to respect the deepand genuine feelings  of the Arabs,  and  to  make  concessions to them,  perhapsconsiderable concessions.  This question cannot be  considered, as the Jews urge,as one of pure economics; very important political considerations are  involved.
I think we have got to &quot;try to find some arrangements about Jewish immigrationto which the Arabs will agree.  But  I. would not go the whole way to meet theArabs.  I do not favour agreement with them at any price.  If they will not move from their extreme demand for a complete stoppage of Jewish immigration andof land sales to Jews, I think we must tell them we cannot consent  to that.     41.  I do not think it would be right to consent to it.   Though we may besceptical about the Zionists&apos; figures of the amount of further immigration whichis practicable, the Jews are undoubtedly right in saying that some considerable further immigration is possible on the strict economic merits of the case.  TheArab plea for a stoppage  of immigration and  land-sales  has sometimes  beenargued on economic grounds. It is alleged that as the result of Jewish immigra-tion and acquisition of land large numbers of  Arabs  have  been driven  out ofemployment  and   rendered  landless.  Neither   of  these   assertions  can besubstantiated.  There  is  no evidence of  any departure  from the criterion ofeconomic capacity under which Jewish immigration has been regulated since 1922.The final answer to Arab complaints on this score is that the  Arab population ofPalestine  has increased since 1922 from something over 000,000 to 1,004,000, aphenomenal rise which has, in fact, been made possible largely by the introduc-tion of Jewish capital and the developments carried out by Jewish immigrants.It seems clear also from the researches of the Peel and the Woodhead Commissionsthat the standard of living of Arab  workers is at least as high now  as  it was before the Balfour Declaration  policy had wrought such changes  in Palestine.As regards  the land, official and Jewish experts have produced widely varyingestimates of the amount of land available for intensive and extensive cultivation,and of the possibilities of making further land available for agriculture by meansof irrigation.  In the view of the High Commissioner and his advisers,  if due allowance is made for  the probable increase of the Arab population, no furtherland is available  for  Jewish agricultural settlement  outside existing Jewishcolonies.   This conclusion is supported by statistics collected in the  course of the numerous  enquiries which have recently been carried out in Palestine, but thesestatistics would be vigorously repudiated by Jewish experts,  and we have to keepin mind that in the past the Jews in Palestine have often confounded critics and experts, and achieved what appeared to be the impossible.  In any  case, some ofthe existing Jewish agricultural settlements are not yet fully developed, and ourown advisers in Palestine agree that as they develop they will be able to supportmany thousands of additional settlers.  And beyond what may be possible in theway  of further  agricultural  settlement,  the Jews  would  urge  that  properindustrial development in Palestine  could  provide for a very large additionalJewish population.     42.  There is  room therefore  for  further agricultural  and  industrialdevelopment.  Moreover, a sudden and complete stoppage of Jewish immigrationwould have a very damaging effect on the economy of the Jewish National Home,and this would have an immediate reaction on the finances of the country.  TheArabs as well as the Jews would suffer from a consequent increase of unemploy-ment and  reduction of social services.  In  view of these considerations it wouldsurely be wrong,  especially in the  present terrible  circumstances of  Jewishpersecution  in Central Europe, to close and bar the  door of Palestine  to theJews.  World  opinion  would be  quick to sympathise with  the Jews,  and to criticise us,  if it could be said that the one land which refused to help the jews in their present plight was the country in  which we had  promised them thatthey could build their  National  Home.  Although we  have consistently adopted the  attitude that  Palestine cannot provide the  whole solution  to  the refugeeproblem, we are bound to agree that Palestine should continue to make  a faircontribution towards its solution.     43.  It may be urged by the Arabs with considerable force that it is unfairthat their country should be picked out to give special  assistance to the unhappyJews.  Our answer to this  will be weak  unless we  can show that both in thiscountry and  in the Colonial Empire we are doing something very substantial inthe way of giving refuge to Jews from Central Europe.  So far as the UnitedKingdom  is  concerned the figures for admissions of Jewish refugees are  very satisfactory. So far as the Colonial Empire is concerned, we can sajr that in somehalf-dozen Colonies special  measures  are being taken  to promote Jewish settle-ment, and that in  three of them the schemes may be very considerable in scope.
 Unfortunately, these territories have not reached a stage of development, such as is the case in Palestine, where immediate large-scale settlement is possible;  but we are pressing ahead with our plans as rapidly as possible.   From the point of view of helping us out of our embarrassment in Palestine, it is of high importance that  these schemes should materialise as soon as may be, for it will assist us in resisting Jewish pressure for  much greater  immigration into Palestine, and also in meeting possible criticism at Geneva and elsewhere, if we have provided other outlets for the refugees.     44.   But here again we must keep a clear eye on British interests.  We cannot afford to lose the friendship of the Arab peoples, especially if  that also involves alienating the sympathy  of the Moslem world in general.  But also we  cannot afford to stir up any  strong anti-British  movement in the United  States of America. If it comes to war,  the sympathy and support of the United States will be more important in the long run than any support that the Arab countries will give us.  And the Jews,  who are capable of influencing to some extent the policies  of various Governments, can exert  particular pressure on the adminis- tration in Washington.  President Roosevelt has  shown a consistent interest in the Palestine question, with a  view to influencing us in the direction of admitting large numbers of Jews to  settlement there.   The American  Ambassador had several talks with me  about it during the autumn, and said that the agitation in the United States at the time when we were rumoured to  be contemplating a complete stoppage  of  Jewish  immigration  was  the  most  sustained  and embarrassing agitation that the President  has had to face since his first few months of office.  I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of Jewish influence in America.   Many people have told  me that  a  Jewish agitation there about Palestine would  be very  hot  and disturbing for a while, but would  not last effectively for very long.  No  doubt  this would be true if our proposals, though disappointing to the Jews,  were such that  they were generally considered fair as between the Jews and the Arabs.  But I  do not think it would be true if  our decision were in favour of  the complete closing of the  door to further Jewish immigration.  That would be a shock to the  American  Government and  public (who  supported the Balfour Declaration and are therefore also committed by this promise to the Jews), which it  would be difficult to eradicate for a long time.    45.   The effect of any such proposal on various of the States who are members of the League of Nations, and who therefore have some standing in this matter, would be similar to its effect  in the United States.  Such a  policy, if brought -  / forward by us, would have a very stormy passage through the League at Geneva, and it is even possible that we should not succeed in carrying it there.    46.  Though I think that the majority in the House of Commons are now in a  frame of mind to support whatever  policy the Government may bring/ forward, provided that the case  for it is carefully and firmly presented, therewould undoubtedly be a  large minority,  even amongst the  Governments  own supporters, who would oppose the complete  stoppage of Jewish immigration.    47.  There  is one  other  factor which  we  cannot ignore.  The Jews are,naturally, in a desperate frame  of  mind.   The events of the last few months have strengthened the  extremist Zionist elements  as against the moderates like Dr. Weizmann.   Jewish feeling  inside Palestine  is tense and bitter just now; it has been deeply stirred by our refusal to  allow the immediate immigration of 10,000 Jewish refugee children from Germany to homes which are waiting forthem  in  Palestine,  and by our rigid restrictions  on the immigration of manyof their  own relations and friends whom they declare that they could support in Palestine,  but who, owing to our refusal to increase the number of immigrationcertificates, must face almost intolerable misery,  perhaps in concentration camps, in Germany.   If immigration is  now stopped completely, or if it is reduced to a very low level, I think the patience of many Jews in Palestine and outside willbe exhausted. Many of the Jews in Palestine can secure arms.  They have seen the Arabs force us by rebellion to pay heed to their case. They are being toldon all hands that the British Government  in these days will  only give way to force.  If they are  too much provoked I think there would be a serious risk of a violent outbreak of Jewish extremists in Palestine,  and our troops would only stop shooting Arabs to start shooting  Jews.  That would be the death-blow toour reputation as administrators in Palestine.
     48.   Nevertheless, we should be prepared to go a long way to meet the Arab representatives.  We should be prepared to go as far as we reasonably can with a view either  to reaching actual agreement, with them, or,  failing agreement, to so reducing their hostility  that there is no longer a formidable risk of their joining our enemies in ease of  trouble.  In weighing the prospects of this perhaps we should anticipate that there will be a distinction between the Palestinian Arab representatives and the  representatives of neighbouring  States.  It is probable that the former will be more tenacious of extreme demands than the latter, and we may find ourselves in a  position, therefore, in which, though        nowhere near agreement with the  Palestinians, we have got some sort of informal under- standing  with  the  others.  In that case the others will not, I think, enter into any agreement with us;  they  will wish to avoid any responsibility for a solution which may be unpopular in  Palestine; but we  shall have the  satisfaction of knowing that the sting is out of the opposition of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. It is  more important that we should regain the  full  sympathy of these neigh- bouring Governments than that we should secure the friendship of the Palestinian Arabs;  they are the countries  whose lukewarm support or actual hostility in case of war would have most  unfortunate results.  Nevertheless,  we must keep it in mind that, if we do not succeed  in taking the sting also out of the  Palestinian Arabs&apos;  opposition  to our policy, the rebellion in Palestine  will  be  maintained for as long as possible; it will continue to receive encouragement from Germany; and we shall be compelled to keep in Palestine  larger military forces than we can properly afford.    49.   Therefore,  with tJhe  qualifications  expressed  in  paragraphs 41-47 above, our main aim during the London discussions should be to reach agreement, either expressed or  tacit,  with the Arab delegations&apos;. I feel all the more strongly that this  is the right course because I  am convinced that in the long run it is the wisest policy from the point of view of the Jews themselves.   It is not simply that Great Britain is the best friend of this sorely tried  and jDersecuted people, and that  it  is against their interests that she should be weakened by losing the sympathy of much  of the Moslem world.  It is  also important from the  point of view of the Jewish National Home itself that a bold attempt should now be made to gain for its future development, even at the expense of reducing the pace of that development, the consent instead of the  hostility  of the Arabs in whose midst it exists.  If the  expansion of the Jewish National Home continues in the face of strong Arab opposition, the prospect of goodwill between the  two peoples will be for ever destroyed; the Jewish community will be a comparatively small island set in  a sea of enemies  over whom they will only be  able to prevailby force; a  permanent relationship of hatred and force  is really unthinkable. Our obligation to the Jews would presumably continue; we could not leave themto their fate; our armed forces would have  to be available to come to their aid against their Arab  foes.    50.   I think the position of the Jewish National Home will be stronger if we can inaugurate a period in which Arab tempers cool; in which some practicalco-operation between Jews and Arabs might grow from the force of circumstances; in which the Arabs, their fear of domination by  the Jews removed, might  begin to appreciate the benefits which the Jews have brought to the whole population ofPalestine; and in which,  even, one or two neighbouring Arab countries, wishing to share in those benefits,  might be able to open their doors to some Jewish settle-ment  in  their undeveloped lands.  The last consideration is one of  particular importance from the Jewish point of view.   The  Jews have always been anxiousto be allowed to expand their settlement beyond the Jordan into Trans-Jordan. Incertain circumstances the Emir Abdullah would  not be averse to this; it would contribute to the wealth  and  well-being of  his country.   But it is  politically impossible for  him to agree  to it whilst  Arab  hostility against the Jews inPalestine is so  intense, and whilst fear of the unlimited expansion of the JewishNational Home and of political and economic domination by the Jews persistsamongst the Arabs  beyond Palestine.  If the Arabs were given guarantees that definite limits were set to the expansion of the Jewish National  Home without their consent, if their fear of domination were definitely and finally removed, thentheir attitude might begin to change.  In time they might well be ready to permitJewish settlements  in other parts of the Near and Middle East.
     51.   That Arab fear of domination by the Jews is the knot that we have to cut  to secure goodwill,  eventually,  in  Palestine.   It exists because at present no limit has been set to  the expansion of the Jewish National Home.  This knot can  only be cut by setting some limit which is reassuring to the Arabs.     52.   Taking all these considerations into account, I suggest that we should be prepared with the following two alternative proposals regarding  future Jewish immigration into Palestine.  We should not bring either of them forward at the beginning of the discussions, but listen to the Arabs and Jewish arguments, and by judicious soundings during the course of the discussions form  our conclusion as to which of them we should suggest for adoption :   (A) (i) During  the next ten years the principle of the economic  absorptive           capacity  of Palestine to  continue to govern the rate of immigration,           subject to a proviso that in any case the number of immigrants should           not exceed  a certain level.  This level would be such as to ensure that           by the end of a ten-year period the Jewish population would not exceed           40 per cent, of the total population of Palestine; (at present it forms           29 per cent.). It might be possible to work out a set of figures  of           percentages  which  the  Jewish  population should not  exceed  in           successive years  during the  ten-year period, but  this would  provide           too  much of a temptation to both Jews and Arabs  to  &apos;&apos; cook &apos;&apos; their           figures of births  and deaths.  It would be better to work out now the           total figure of Jewish immigration in successive years which might be           allowed so  as to provide that at the end of the tenth year the Jewish           population did if  the economic absorptive capacity of the  country           allowed it reach the 40 per cent. mark.   These figures would  then           become the quotas  of immigration which would be allowed.  If  in          ione  year the economic absorptive capacity did not permit of the full           quota  of  immigrants for that year being admitted, and in the  next           year the economic absorptive capacity  allowed more than the quota           fixed for that second year, then I think that some of the surplus owing           from the earlier year should be added to the second year&apos;s quota.               We might be prepared to yield something from the 40 per  cent.           figure.  If  the Arabs would not agree  to that, perhaps they would           agree  to some figure like 35 per  cent.  I  understand that, if the figure           were 40 per cent., the  average  Jewish immigration which would  be           possible  per annum during  the ten years would amount to  29,840           individuals.  If  the figure  were 35 per cent., it would  amount  to           15,300.    (ii) At the end of the ten-year period the whole question of  the principles           to govern future immigration to be the subject  of discussion between           Arab representatives, Jewish representatives, and the Government. (B) The  same  proposal   as  in  (A)   above,  but  with  the   difference           that, instead of  saying that at the  end of the ten-year  period the           question of future  immigration would  be  the  subject of  discussion           between  Arabs,  Jews and  the  Government,  we should  state  that           after the  ten-year period there  could be no further Jewish immigra-           tion except by agreement between Arab and Jewish representatives           and the Government.  This  would give the  Arabs an actual  veto  on           any further expansion of the Jewish National Home after ten years.               If we  adopt this proposal  I am strongly inclined to think  that           we should not reduce the percentage which is to be allowed to the           Jews if  the economic absorptive capacity of the country permits it            much  below the  figure  of 40 per cent.   ,  Immigration should be controlled by the High Commissioner with a stronglystaffed Immigration  Department, and a permanent identity card  system wouldseem to be inevitable in order to check illegal immigration.     53.  I doubt whether proposal (A) would  in the least degree  satisfy theArab representatives.  Though  it gives certain guarantees regarding the next tenyears, it leaves the question of future immigration at the end of that period open,and, therefore,  would not sufficiently remove the Arab fear of domination by theJews. Though I put it forward  as an idea that we should keep in mind, and secure agreement to, if possible, I do not really think that  it will prove feasible.  We are almost certain to  have to move  to proposal (B), which has got the merit from the
Arab point of view of setting a limit beyond which the Jewish National Homecannot expand without their consent.  I believe that assurance will carry great weight with  reasonable Arabs.    54.  It is possible that the  Arab  representatives will prove  completelyunreasonable  and adamant on this question of immigration, and that they willunitedly  stand firm on their demand that Jewish immigration should be com-pletely stopped.   I do not think that they will,  especially if we are firm in ouropposition to such a  demand.  Individual Egyptian and  Iraqi representatives(like the  present Egyptian Prime Minister and the late Iraqi Foreign Minister)have often showed a willingness to consider and recommend some such proposals as those outlined in (B) above.  But they may not now be willing to do so. Arabfeeling has been inclined to harden of late.  In that case we shall have to considerwhether it is so  important that we should regain unqualified Arab  goodwill and bring the Arab rebellion in Palestine to an immediate end that we should accede totheir demand.  I have stated the arguments against our doing so in paragraphs41-47 of this memorandum,  and at present  I believe  that  they  are  over-overwhelmingly weighty.  But I understand that the Secretary of State for  ForeignAffairs and  his advisers  are inclined to  take  a different view,  based on  thegreat danger to our  interests which they apprehend from any continuance  of arab hostility, which might spread throughout the Moslem world.   I agree that,if any widespread hostility to us in the  Moslem world is  really  involved, wecannot afford that, and must yield to the degree that may be necessary to avoidit.   &quot;We  shall be able to estimate  the  prospects more accurately during  theforthcoming  discussions in London,  and I  do not  therefore press  for a  decisionon the point  now.     55.  In  the meantime I  should  advise my colleagues that, though the Jewsmight accept the proposal in (A)  above, they  will certainly regard as  quiteunacceptable proposal (B).  Even Jews  of great moderation like  Lord Samuelwould be likely to criticise it as putting too  great an obstacle in the way of thedevelopment  of the Jewish National Home after ten more years.  If we  adopted the  proposal, we should  have to put  it  through in  the face of very strong opposition from the  Jews and their friends.  Though criticism would  be  very heavy in Parliament  and  at Geneva, we  could defend the policy as one which is consistent with our obligations under the Mandate.  It  is not consistent with ourinterpretation of  the Mandate as  practised over many years and defined in mr.  Ramsay  MacDonald&apos;s letter of 1931, where  the economic absorptive capacityof Palestine is  declared  to be  the  sole criterion governing  immigration.   Weshould have  to admit frankly  that  our  new policy was a departure  from thatinterpretation, and appeal back to the governing instrument, the Mandate itself.Under the Mandate  we are obliged to  facilitate Jewish  immigration  &apos;&apos; undersuitable  conditions.&quot;   We can properly argue  that  between 1922  and recenttimes conditions were such that it was &apos;&apos; suitable &apos;&apos; that the economic criterionshould alone prevail, but that circumstances have now altered and other con-siderations, i.e., that it is now clear beyond  a  shadow of doubt that the arab population (whose &apos;&apos; rights and position &apos;&apos; we are pledged to safeguard)  will notbe reconciled to an indefinite continuation of Jewish immigration, must also nowbe taken into account.                               C. Land Sales.     56.  Article 6 of the Mandate requires that the Administration,  &quot;whileensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are notprejudiced, .... shall encourage ....  close settlement by Jews on the land.&quot;The fulfilment of this dual obligation has proved one of the most difficult problemsof the Palestine Government.  The protection of tenants has been secured by aseries of Ordinances, but nothing has yet been done to prevent an Arab landownerfrom parting with the whole of his  land to the  Jews.     57.  The Arabs  are demanding the  complete cessation  of sales of  land toJews. I  do  not think this would  be justified, but in the light of the findings ofSir John Hope  Simpson,  the  Peel Commission  and the Woodhead Commission,some restriction on the sale of land from Arabs to Jews is clearly necessary inorder to prevent existing landowners becoming completely landless and to provide
for the needs 6f the growing Arab population.  Such legislation presents certainpractical difficulties, and the details will need careful consideration, but I recom-mend that action on these lines should form a part of any future settlement.    58.  Successive  Commissions have recommended that the Government shouldassist in such specific schemes of land development (with a view, for example, tochanging  extensive Arab cultivation  into intensive cultivation) as may appear,after proper investigation, to be practicable, and that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould consider favourably helping  any such schemes  by loans or otherwise.Expert enquiries indicate that the scope for such schemes  is limited, but I hopethat it may be possible to achieve something in this direction.              D. The Part of Jews and Arabs in Government.    59.  If we are  to continue our responsibility as Mandatory Power for thegovernment of the whole of Palestine, and if we are contemplating a restriction of Jewish immigration such as is suggested  in  paragraphs  52-54 above, thenwhat steps should we take to give Jews  and Arabs  a share  in the business ofthe Government, to carry out our obligation to secure the development of &quot; self-governing institutions 5&apos; ?    60.  In the first place, we should encourage the development of local govern-ment as far as possible.  There are urban and  rural areas where the population is almost entirely Arab and others where the population is almost entirely Jewish(for example, the city of Jaffa and the Galilee highlands, and the city of Tel Avivand plain of Esdraelon, respectively).  In  local government Arabs and Jews alikealready have a considerable control over  their own affairs.   But there is room for further developmeint in this direction.  In particular there is complaint thatthe central Government keeps too tight a control over the finances of the largerlocal authorities such as that of Tel Aviv, and that the local administration hasnot sufficient freedom in making up  its budget and spending its own  revenues.I recommend that the powers of municipal bodies under the Municipal  Corpora-tions Ordinance should be re-examined, and extended as far as possible, and thatthe revenues of the larger municipalities should be increased, perhaps by allottingto them a  portion of the urban property tax collected in their areas.    61.  Greater difficulty arises when we consider what  should be the form ofGovernment at the centre.  Our  answer to the question must depend partly on what is the ultimate objective that we are aiming at in Palestine.   What is theform of the constitution in Palestine  which we think will eventually bring peace between the two peoples who at present share the land ?    62.  I think there are two alternatives :       (i) The preservation of  Palestine with  its  present  boundaries as  a           &apos;&apos; bi-national &apos;&apos; state, in which the two races are regarded, and come           to regard each other, as  equals in status, with equal rights in the           government  of  their  country.  This would involve a  considerable           period of British Mandatory Government whilst the Jews and Arabs           were learning to co-operate with each  other  in the management of           their common affairs.   The idea of  a state in which two peoples live           side by side and enjoy equality of status implies  that in the central           organs of Government (e.g., the Legislature) -each of them has equal           numerical representation,  whichever may from time to time comprise           a majority of the total population  of the country.               Perhaps this would be  possible in Palestine.   Some people who           have lived long in the country advocate this proposal.  In many ways           it would be the best  thing  that could  happen there.  But  I doubt           whether   it   is  practicable.    I   doubt  whether,  however  much           we  may be  able   to   improve  relations   between   Jews   and           Arabs, they  will ever be able  to  co-operate  to  this extent  in  an           equal  partnership.  Though they do, in fact, belong to the same race,           mixing them is like trying to  mix oil and water.  Their civilisations          &apos; are  different - their religions  are different; their temperaments are           different; their interests would clash at many points; they do not like           each other; each of them wants to be the master.
               Therefore,  I am inclined to lean towards the second ultimate           solution to the Palestine problem, which would involve-      (ii) An eventual return to some form of partition between a Jewish and an           Arab  area  in Palestine.   I doubt  whether the  difficulties of  the           Palestine problem can be  overcome,  unless Palestine is treated as           part of a larger  whole.  Many people regard the union in some form           or other of  the Lebanon,  Syria,  Trans-Jordan  and  Palestine as           ultimately inevitable.  This association might  take the  form of the           abolition&apos;of alb  Mandates  in the area and  the establishment of an           independent federation between different units, i.e., an Arab Lebanon,           an Arab Syria,  another Arab territory  comprising most  of Trans-           Jordan and&quot; the part of Palestine which remained predominantly Arab,           and a Jewish territory composed  of the part of Palestine which is pre-           dominantly Jewish and to  which might be added an area of Trans-           Jordan if Jewish settlement is  in due course permitted there.   The           Arab or Jewish Governments of  each territory would, of course, enjoy           wide powers within their own territories respectively, but the federal           authority would  have certain reserved powers in matters of common           concern.               This solution would satisfy a number of conditions which seem           to require satisfaction if permanent peace between Arabs and Jews in           the Near East is  to be established. It would to a large extent separate           into their respective spheres the Arabs and Jews  in Palestine,  and           prevent  them from getting  at each other&apos;s throats;  it would meet the           Jews&apos; desire to have a considerable territory in which they are free to           develop  their own life; and at the same time, by making this Jewish           territory only one out of three or four units in  a federation in which           the other equal units were Arab  territories, it would afford the Arabs           in that part of the world a guarantee against domination by the Jews.    63.  There are certain forces now working in the direction of this  lattersolution, and if we are agreed  as to its advantages  we should deliberately from now onwards endeavour to avoid an)&apos; policy in  Palestine or the Near East whichmight  prejudice  its ultimate attainment.  But there  are many difficulties inthe way.   For instance, the French  Government are opposed to  this solution,since  they are afraid that one of its consequences might be that  the french were elbowed out of the Eastern Mediterranean altogether.  In order to avoidoffending the French our representatives in the forthcoming London discussions should not be led  into any  discussion of this  proposal for federation.  In  anyease, it is  bound to be  a long  time before affairs  evolve  into a federation of territories  in that part of the world, and it does not seem to be practical politicsat present to take any actual step in the direction either of partition in Palestine,or of a union of larger areas.  Certain suggestions in the  direction of partitionin Palestine may be put forward by the Jews during the forthcoming Palestinediscussions; they may attempt to secure from the Arabs that a part of palestine should be handed over to them for undisturbed development, in return for theirraising money to help  both Jewish  and  Arab development  elsewhere.  I donot think that in their present  tempers the Arabs will accept such  a proposal;for the time being they have been frightened off partition in any  form.   Butif they do show any inclination to favour it,  we should  encourage them.    64.  Though I suggest therefore  that  the second  of  these plans should be our ultimate objective, I think that we should frame our immediate constitutional proposals on the assumption that international difficulties may delay for a longtime,  or even prevent  altogether, a federation of territories in  the Near East.For this reason I would propose that in the  meantime any constitutional develop-ment which has the object of giving the Jews and the Arabs a part  in the centralgovernment of Palestine should be based  on  the principles laid  down in thefirst plan above, i,e., that Palestine is a &quot;  bi-national &quot; State  in which the  twopeoples are equal  in status. A beginning in  the direction of this  plan wouldnot be  an obstacle to progress later on in the direction of the second plan.  Indeed,if we  can  get Arab and Jewish representatives meeting  and working together on  Government bodies,  this may improve relations between  them  and enablediscussions on the partition-with-federation plan to take place in a less prejudicedatmosphere.
    65.  As a first step I suggest that the High Commissioner, representing theMandatory Power, should be assisted in his task not only by an official ExecutiveCouncil (such as exists to-day)  but also by  an Advisory Council which would include, in addition to an official bloc, Jewish and Arab representatives in equal numbers.  The Jewish and Arab members would be elected on communal registers.The constitution, which  would be embodied  in a  new Order-in-Council,  should provide that  the High Commissioner must consult the Advisory Council on all important matters such as immigration, finance and tariffs.  I suggest also thatit should  provide that, if a majority of the  members of the Advisory  council which  included  a majority  both of the  Arab  and of  the Jewish representativespassed a resolution asking that  the Advisory  Council should be superseded  by  a legislative Council on the  basis of parity between the  two peoples, then  sucha Legislative Council should be established.    66.  Our ability to establish an Advisory Council on the lines proposed abovemust, of course, depend upon  the  willingness of the Jews and Arabs  to  electrepresentatives  to it and to co-operate  upon  it.   I think  that  the Jews would agree to do so,   The attitude of the Arabs is likely to be less friendly.  They willobject  to the principle of equal representation, and  the odds  are in favour oftheir definitely refusing, at present, to  take part in any body so composed.  Onthe other  hand,  if we  accept the principle now that the Jews should be repre-sented only in proportion to their numbers, we shall be creating a precedent whichwill condemn them to  a  position of a permanent  minority  in the governmentalbodies of the country.  For the reasons stated  elsewhere in this memorandum, andespecially because this would be  a breach of the spirit of the Balfour declaration and Mandate, I do not think it either expedient or right to do this.   We shouldsound the Jewish and Arab  representatives on the matter during the forthcoming-discussions.  It  is possible that, although the Arabs  would at present refuse toco-operate  on  a  Legislative Council composed on the principle  of parity,  theymight  agree to serve on an Advisory Council  so composed.                           E. The Jewish Agency.    67.  Under Article  4 of the Palestine Mandate the Jewish Agency has tobe recognized &quot;as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establishment of  the Jewish national home and the  interests ofthe Jewish population in Palestine, and, subject  always  to the control of theAdministration, to assist and take part  in the development of the country.&quot;  the agency is composed  of  representatives from various countries (including theUnited States of America), which means that the Jews of the  world  are  able,through this  instrument, to intervene in the  affairs of Palestine.  In accordancewith Article  4 of the Mandate, the Government of Palestine has hitherto taken the Palestine Executive of the Jewish Agency into consultation in connectionwith  the drafting  of legislation (e.g.,  immigration,  land and local  government legislation), tariffs, social services,  and all matters affecting the interests of theJewish population.  The officers of the Agency in London have also had readyaccess to the Colonial  Office.  The Arabs have always objected to this  power of world Jewry, which has frequently been exercised to what they regard as  theirdetriment.  It may be that the Arab representatives in the London  discussionswill press for the abolition of the Jewish Agency&apos;s special rights in this matter.    68.  If an  Advisory Council, as proposed above, is  estabished in Palestine,there will  be less reason for the Jewish Agency&apos;s right to  approach the Govern-ment.  The Jews will  have their elected representatives  on the Council, and theHigh Commissioner will be obliged to consult the members of the Council on all matters of importance, such as  immigration.   It would,  indeed, be anomalous  tohave  an additional body,  the  Agency, also  approaching  and discussing  thesematters with the High Commissioner in Palestine and the Colonial Secretary  inLondon.  The Arabs  might well  suspect that the Government  and  the jewish agency were conspiring behind the scenes to counteract  any advice which theAdvisory Council, with  its Arab members^ gave to the High Commissioner.   Itwould be a good thing if, in these circumstances, we  could reduce the rights and powers of the Jewish Agency.  Such a step  would impress the Arabs with thegenuineness of  our intention to treat the Arabs and Jews on an equal footing.
    69.  On the other hand, the proposals contained in this paper  are alreadygoing to be  a very bitter pill for the Jews to swallow.  They may provoke themalmost to the extreme.   The curtailment of the rights of the Jewish Agencywould  be an additional blow which might just  drive the Jews and their friendsinto really damaging opposition.   They  will claim that there is a distinctionbetween  the Jewish representation on the Advisory Council and  the Jewishrepresentation in the Jewish Agency.  The former will be confined to citizens of Palestine, whereas the other represents the Jews of the  world;  and they willpoint out that the  promise of a National Home was made to the Jews  of  theworld,  and  that  it  was  also  promised that  representatives   of  this wideconstituency would be enabled to co-operate with the Government in the workof establishing a National Home in Palestine.   In fact, any curtailment of theright of the Jewish Agency in the direction suggested would involve a modifica-tion of  our promises  to  the Jews  and an  amendment  of  Article  4  of  theMandate.  As I have said above, American Jewry  is represented  on the jewish agency, and the &quot;  disestablishment &quot; of that organ would be  a matter of directconcern to a powerful body of opinion in the United States.  There is a danger that this proposal, coming on the top of many others which  will be grievouslydisappointing to the  Jews, would provoke such a reaction in  the  United Statesthat a really awkward situation arose between the American Government and ourselves.  We might in the end find that we should have  to give way to strongprotests from the American Government.     70.   Therefore, we must be cautious on this matter.   Let us wait and see whether the Arabs raise it, and, if they do, how strongly they press it.  If theypress it strongly, let us try to gauge what the effect-of this additional proposal would be on the temper of the Jews.  It may be that they will be so bitter in anycase that this additional disappointment will make little difference to their mood.     71.   In any case,  I do  not  propose  that we should take  a decision on thematter now, and only draw my colleagues&apos; attention to it because it may arise.     72.   If it is not raised by the Arabs,  I would be in  favour  of leaving theposition as  it is at present.  If an Advisory Council were established,  we could then gradually in practice reduce  our contacts with the Jewish Agency, on thegrounds that the Advisory Council was performing the function of  contact withthe High Commissioner on the subjects which the Jewish Agency  used to discuss with him and the Government.  In time the position might have been so adjustedthat we could make the change, even to the extent  of amending Article 4 of theMandate, without any  trouble.     73.  Proposals have been mooted in the past  (and they  were supported bythe Peel Commission) for the creation of an Arab  Agency to counterbalance theJewish  Agency.   It  is, however, difficult to conceive of any  Arab  organisation which would be equivalent in functions and influence to the Jewish  Agency, andthe permanent association with Palestine politics of representatives of other arab countries,  apart  from its  practical  difficulties,  might  well prove  seriouslyembarrassing in the international sphere.                      SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.    74.  The following is therefore a  summary of my recommendations.  ButI would repeat that we should not reach an absolutely final decision on  any ofthese points until the discussions with Jews and Arabs have proceeded some way.The attitude of either party might lead  us to the conclusion that it would be wise to modify one or other of these proposals in some way :                           I. Future  Constitution.    (1) Neither the Jewish claim for the creation at some future date of a jewish state covering the whole of Palestine nor the Arab claim that the country should become an Arab state can be admitted.   We should make a clear statement  thatthis is so, unless at any time in the future conditions so change that either theArab or the Jewish population in Palestine are ready to acquiesce in the creationof an independent state in which the other  party predominates (paragraph 22et seq).
    (2) We  should  offer  to establish, in  addition  to  the existing  officialExecutive  Council,  an Advisory  Council,  which  would  include, besides anofficial bloc, Jewish  and Arab representatives in equal numbers.   Jewish andArab members would be elected on communal registers.  The constitution should provide that the High Commissioner must consult the  Advisory Council on all important matters such as immigration, finance and tariffs.   It should also provide that,  if a majority of the  members of  the Advisory Council, which included  amajority both of the  Arab and Jewish representatives, passed a resolution asking that the Advisory Council  should be superseded by a Legislative Council on thebasis  of parity between the two peoples, then such a Legislative Council shouldbe established (paragraph 65).    (3) The powers of municipal bodies  under  the Municipal  Corpoi&apos;ation&apos;sOrdinance should be  re-examined and extended as far as possible and the revenues of the larger municipalities should be increased, perhaps  by allotting to them  a portion of the urban property tax collected in their areas  (paragraph 60).                             II. Immigration.    We  should listen to  the Arab  and Jewish  arguments  and  by judicioussoundings during the course of the discussions form our  conclusion as to which of the following two  alternative proposals  should be suggested  for  adoption(paragraph  52) :     A.   (i)  Jewish immigration  into Palestine should  continue to be regulated by the criterion of  economic absorptive capacity  subject  to  the  proviso  that,in any case, the number of immigrants should not exceed such a level as would increase the Jewish population to the figure of 40 per cent, of the total populationby the end of ten years.  If the Arabs would not agree to the figure of 40 per cent.we should endeavour to persuade them to agree to some such figure as 35 per cent.    (ii) At the end of the  ten-year period the question  of  the  principles to govern further Jewish immigration should be the subject of discussion betweenArabs, Jews and His Majesty&apos;s Government.    3L  As in A. above, but with the difference  that, instead  of making thefuture control of immigration the subject of discussion at  the end of the ten-year period, we should state that after the ten-year period further Jewish immigrationmust  be dependent  on agreement between  Arab  and Jewish  representatives and the Government, i.e., the Arabs would be given a veto on any further expan-sion of the  Jewish National Home after ten years.  If we adopt  this proposalI am strongly inclined to think that we should not agree to  a reduction of the prospective  Jewish percentage (subject to economic absorptive capacity) much below 40 per cent.     [N.B.
