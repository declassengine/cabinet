Memorandum by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee. Introduction.     AT their 331st Meeting (Minute (11)), the Committee of Imperial Defence recorded the following conclusions :    &quot; (a)  To approve the proposals of the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Com-           mittee in C.I.D. Paper No. 475-C for anti-aircraft defences at certain           Category &apos;&apos; A &quot; ports abroad, as summarised in Columns (/), (g) and           (h)  of Appendix  &quot;A,&quot; which  represent, in conjunction with  the           defences previously approved (vide Columns (6), (c), (d) and  (e)),  the           minimum provision  and the immediate requirements for the ports           concerned.     (b)  To approve, as desirable, the additional defences for Malta and Aden           shown in brackets in Columns (/), (g) and (h) of Appendix &quot; A &quot; of           C.I.D. Paper No.  475-C.     (c)  To take note that in  the opinion of the Naval Staff the defences referred           to in  (a) above would not provide really adequate protection for  the           ports  concerned. -   . (d)  To instruct the Joint Oversea and Home Defence  Committee to keep           under constant review the scales of  anti-aircraft defences approved           for the defended ports abroad, with a view to their further increase if           circumstances should demand, and finance and industrial production       ------ permit.&quot;     2.   In accordance with the above conclusions, and at the request of the Chief of the Naval Staff,  the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee have  had under review the  anti-aircraft defences of Gibraltar, Malta and Aden in the light of developments in the international situation.     3.   Early in the course of their discussions the Committee realised that there were two sides to the problem, the one of immediate concern, and the other  of less. urgency, though still of great importance.  The first part of  the problem relates to the present approved scales of anti-aircraft defences  at these ports, and the. rate at which they are being completed.  The Committee are so impressed with the gravity of the position that they feel it their duty to bring it to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence forthwith, while proceeding with their inves- investigation of the second part,  i.e., the review of  existing approved scales.  Their recommendations  on the latter must await the completion of the European Appreciation now being prepared by the Chiefs of Staff.&apos;j-f-i-:&apos;i   [ 18407&apos;] :                                                     B

The result has been that up  to the present n63-7-inch guns have yet been sent abroad, and under present arrangements delivery to the three ports under review will not start until March 1939.  4-5-inch guns,the production of which is now beginning,  will not  be  available for any of  thethree ports  before September 1939.  Since  4-5-inch guns are  to constitute  thetotal of anti-aircraft guns at Aden, three-quarters at Gibraltar, and two-thirdsat Malta, the ports in question will be practically defenceless  until September1939, .  No acceleration of  these figures is  possible without a modification of  thepresent ruling as to priority of supply.Searchlights.     6:   The supply situation is fairly satisfactory  in that all three ports will be complete by June  1939; but the man-power to serve those lights, which are being sent out in the Spring, will not be available  until the trooping season 1939-40.Light A.A.

No  R.D.F. sets  will be available before June 1939 at the earliest.   the installation of R.D.F. at those bases which can be approached by aircraft over thesea, is a matter of grave urgency.R.A.F.

Man-Power.    10.  The coast and air defence units of these three ports are still on LowerColonial Establishment,  which means that they can only man a  portion of the approved armament.  At a meeting on the 23rd  March, 1938,*  the  cabinet approved a  recommendation by  the Committee  of  Imperial Defence  to thefollowing effect:           &apos;&apos; To recommend that the principle should be re-established and rigidly    observed  in the future  that,  wherever  their  communications are  liable to    interruption, our overseas garrisons should be maintained in peace time at    a strength adequate for defence on the outbreak of war; or alternatively that    the  necessary reserves should be held  in the  neighbourhood  available to    reinforce at short notice.&quot;    This decision is tantamount, in the case of Malta and Aden, to authority forthe garrison  at those ports to be kept at Higher  Colonial Establishment.  TheTreasury Inter-Service Committee has recently approved in  principle that the garrisons of Malta and Aden should be raised to Higher Colonial Establishmentprovided that the War Office can finance the proposal from a new conspectus.   Wewould  urge most  strongly that the necessary increase in garrisons should  nolonger  be delayed.A accommodation.    11.  The provision of permanent accommodation to house increased garrisonsat Gibraltar,  Malta and Aden is similarly held up for lack of funds.  The positionis  set out in full in the Annex.Conclusions.    12.  The Joint  Oversea  and Home Defence Committee would be failing intheir duty if they did not draw  the attention of  the Committee  of  ImperialDefence  to the serious gaps which exist in the anti-aircraft defences of these important bases, as  disclosed by the  facts set out above, to the length of  time that will elapse before even  the existing scale of  defences is completed, and tothe fact  that no acceleration is  possible  unless the ruling that the  Air Defenceof Great Britain is to have absolute priority is modified.    13.  The measures which call for urgent consideration may be summarisedas follows:      (i)  The rate  of supply of equipment.           (a) The acceleration  of the provision of 3-7-inch  and 4-5-inch  guns                 up to present  approved scales.           (6) The immediate provision  of a mobile R.D.F. set at Malta.           (c) The acceleration of provision of  Bofors single equipments for                 Aden and Malta.           (d) The acceleration of R.A.F. squadrons.     (ii)  Provision of man-power.               Immediate steps to be sanctioned to bring the strength of the           units required  to man  the present approved scale of  anti-aircraft           defences at Malta and Aden up to Higher Colonial Establishment.    (iii)  Accommodation.               Approval to proceed forthwith with the programme of provision           of accommodation for the  anti-aircraft units  required.

ANNEX.                                    The War Office, London, S.W. 1,(Secret.)                                                December 16, 1938.    The Secretary,         Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.      I. Raising of certain Garrisons to Higher Colonial Establishment.    The decision to raise  certain ports  abroad from  L.C.E. to H.C.E. was approved by Cabinet in March 1938, but this has not yet been implemented.Financial approval for these measures has been delayed and application for  fundshas not yet been submitted to T.I.S.C.  This should be done without further delay, since the full manning of our  defences at the more essential naval basesdepends on the provision of this extra personnel and on accommodation for them.         II. Accommodation Situation Gibraltar, Malta and Aden.Gibraltar.    2.  The decision to raise the garrison to Higher  Colonial Establishment isin abeyance for financial reasons,  and in consequence the barrack constructionscheme, which  was estimated to cost approximately  500,000, will not now becarried out.    3.  The existing barracks will, in all probability, be  unable to house morethan the present Lower Colonial Establishment, which will leave the followingarmament unmanned : .    Coast Defence          Lower Group  ....................    3-9&apos;2-inch.TovevA.M.T.B. defencesDefence Electric LightsAnti-Aircraft ....2-6-inch.2 equipments.68-4-5-inch.    4.  The War  Office is  at  present  examining the barrack  situation  at gibraltar with a view  to accommodating as much as possible of the personnelrequired to man the above eight 4-5-inch A.A.  guns.Malta.    5.  The accommodation requirements for  the implementation of the policywhereby the garrison is to be raised from L.C.E. to FLOE, have been submittedby G.O.C., Malta.    6.  The outstanding feature of  the scheme is the expansion of the RoyalMalta Artillery  from  its  present strength of  approximately  500  to a totalof 1,650.    7.  Malta have, in addition to  planning for this increased garrison, to buildtwo  new  barracks  for  infantry  battalions as  well  as  reconstruct  two  existinginfantry barracks.  New barracks will be required for one anti-aircraft regimentand  a mobile artillery regiment.     8.  It  is safe  to  assume that  it will  take three years to complete this programme, and, as a temporary measure, Malta propose to house troops in thewar accommodation at  outlying forts.  This is not a satisfactory solution to theproblem, but on the grounds of economy it will have to be accepted.Aden.     9.  New barracks  for one Hong  Kong-Singapore RA. anti-aircraft battery(eight 4-5-inch and four 2-pdrs.) and for one British searchlight battery (twelvelights) are to be built.  The plans are being worked out in conjunction with theAir Ministry, who are  responsible for construction, and it is reported that thesebarracks will not be ready for three years.     10.   As a temporary measure, the anti-aircraft personnel are to be housedin existing buildings at Sheikh Othman.
Conclusions.     11.  Enough information has been given above to show that there is a grave risk of accommodation difficulties  at these three ports, which may lead to seriousdelays in  the  full  manning of  the  approved  defences,  and that  makeshiftarrangements are  already  relied upon  to carry out the policy  approved by theCabinet as long ago as February 1938.     12.  It is clear, therefore, that any personnel in addition to that required forthe present approved armament must be housed in temporary accommodation forthe next two  years.           III. Personnel Situation Gibraltar, Malta and Aden.     13.  Any additions to the existing garrison at Gibraltar would be entirelyBritish, and therefore subject to the limitations  imposed by the  recruitingsituation.     14.  At  Malta, the expansion  of the garrison is to be almost entirely Maltese,an increase of about 1,100 being required.  These, it is hoped, will be recruitedby the end of 1939, but they will not, of course, be efficient by that  date.  It willprobably be two years before the approved armament will be properly manned.     15.  At  Aden,  the  expansion  is  largely  for  the approved  anti-aircraft defences.  The guns are to be manned by a Hong Kong-Singapore Battery, R.A.,the first draft of which will reach Aden in May 1939.  The remaining 200 oddwill be recruited during 1939, but  will  not be trained to efficiency until the latterend of 1940.     16.  It will thus be seen that, from the point of view of provision of personnel to man any additions to the approved armament  at these three ports, it will not,in practice, be possible to man efficiently any such additions for a further periodof about three years.

ANTI-AIRCRAFT  DEFENCES.                  GIBRALTAR,  MALTA AND ADEN.                         (C.I.D. Paper No. 489-C.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the JointOversea and Home Defence Committee on the anti-aircraft defences of Gibraltar,Malta and Aden (C.I.D.  Paper No. 489-C).    GENERAL ISMAY, introducing the Memorandum, said that after the crisislast September the Chief of Naval  Staff had drawn attention to the absence of adequate anti-aircraft defences  at the three ports in question, and at the requestof the Cabinet Committee on Defence Programmes and Acceleration had brought the matter before the Joint Oversea and Home Defence  Committee.  The report which was now before  the Committee of Imperial Defence made no attempt torecommend any increases in  present approved scales, but was solely concernedwith the rate at which  those scales were being completed.  The situation was setout in the table in paragraph 4, from which it would  be observed that the portswere to all intents and purposes defenceless until July  1939.  An improvement inthe situation could only be made  by a relaxation of the &quot; absolute priority &quot;which the Cabinet had  accorded to the A.D.G.B.  Beside guns there were certain other  items mentioned in the report, particularly the provision of R.D.F. formaltality.  This equipment would  be of the utmost value at Malta,  but again couldbe provided only by taking one of the mobile  sets  from the A.D.G.B.  chain.    LORD ZETLAND said that he was particularly concerned with the position at Aden.  Aden was  an essential port on our line of communications to the East,and the Indian Government had an interest  in the provision of the full scale of defences, as the troops  to form  the garrison would come from India.    SIR  THOMAS INSKIP  said  that  the question  of  principle which theCommittee had to decide was whether to recommend to the Cabinet a relaxation of the A.D.G.B. priority  in favour of these ports, Thirty guns were required tocomplete,  with the 3-inch already  installed, the full numbers  of the  present authorised scale.    MR. MALCOLM MACDON ALD observed that  Lord Zetland had advancedthe particular needs of Aden, but Malta and Gibraltar were, in his view, equally important.  If a war in which  Italy would be an enemy was at all likely before july, he thought the effects on our prestige would be serious if Italian aeroplaneswere at liberty to fly with impunity over Malta and Gibraltar.  He could not regard such a state of  affairs with anything  but grave concern,  and he thoughtthat the  priority accorded to A.D.G.B. should be relaxed, at any rate to someextent.    LORD STANHOPE said  that  he  took  an  even  more serious  view  of the lack of defences at these ports  than Lord Zetland and Mr. MacDonald.  Malta[18556-2]
was the main Fleet base in the Mediterranean.  No repair, facilities existed else-where;  and, although in the recent crisis the Fleet had gone to Alexandria, thatwas not because Alexandria provided them with a naval  base.  There had beenvarious discussions  as  to  the  possibility  of  providing another base,  and  theconclusion had always been reached that the outlay required to turn any otherMediterranean harbour into a secure base comparable with Malta was too  great.Furthermore, it was likely that the scale of air attack on any such base wouldalso  be very  heavy.   The  cheapest  course was  undoubtedly to  make Maltaimpregnable, and he would urge that these anti-aircraft  guns should be put inas early as possible.  He was informed that 200 anti-aircraft guns were reservedfor the Expeditionary  Force;  but, -if  the Fleet could not be maintained,  the expeditionary  Force would be unable to proceed anywhere and its anti-aircraft guns would not be needed.  He placed Malta  first  in order  of  priority, thenGibraltar, and then Aden.    Turning to the question of personnel to man the defences, he drew attentionto paragraph  10 of the report.  Nine months ago the Cabinet had decided thatthe garrison of these ports should be raised to  Higher Colonial Establishment.Nothing had been  done, nor had any report been rendered to the Cabinet on  thesubject.  In the annex to the report it was stated that it would take three years to train the personnel required for the anti-aircraft guns.   The Maltese wereperfectly capable of manning these guns, and he thought that if a start were made immediately they should be able to become as efficient  on anti-aircraft  guns asthey were on coast defence.  They could live at  home and thus obviate the needfor accommodation.  At Gibraltar it would probably  be  necessary   to haveRegulars, and at Aden the personnel could come from India.    SIR CYRIL NEWALL said that  he  considered  ^d  the situation disclosed was so serious that  some  modification of the priority of  A.D.G.B.  should  be recommended.  He thought the  Committee might discuss the precise number of guns that should be provided.    MR.  HORE-BELISHA  said  that   the present  discussion showed  the disadvantage of considering  defence in compartments.  He was  quite aware ofthe defects in our  defences, but last April  he had been forced to  accept  a cut of 70,000,000.  The Committee could hardly expect  such a deduction to be made without causing inconvenience.  He had had to cut down anti-aircraft and coast defence expenditure.  Now he was faced with agitation  for the provision of gunsat home just as vehement as that for the provision of  guns at ports abroad.  TheGeneral Staff could not advise him to accept a modification of the existing  priorityas long as the defences at home were so weak.   It was quite true that HigherColonial Establishment had been  authorised by the Cabinet last April, but themoney to give  effect to their decision had  not been forthcoming.  Nor wasaccommodation available for the men who would be required.    SIR  KINGSLEY  WOOD  said  that he  fully  realised  the  difficultiesconfronting the Secretary  of State for War,  but he  thought under the circum-stances which faced them they  would have to  accept  risks somewhere.  he admitted that it was a risk to denude A.D.G.B., but  he thought  that in view ofthe necessity  for  maintaining our Imperial  position and our prestige in  theMediterranean it was a risk they would have to accept.    MR. MALCOLM MACDONALD  said he fully realised the strength  of the agitation at home for  strong defences, but he  thought there would be equallygreat disquiet if  it were realised that we were leaving  these vital Fleet baseswithout adequate  defences against air  attack.  He understood that the  Chief ofthe Imperial  General Staff would shortly be discussing with the Governor of malta methods of making use of local personnel to man batteries.     SIR  ROGER BACKHOUSE was certain  that there would be no difficultyover  personnel at Malta.  The  Maltese  already  manned coast defences verysatisfactorily.     SIR  THOMAS INSKIP  said that  the  proposal  before  the  Committeeinvolved an acceleration of provision.   It  was a question of degree.  Should theCommittee, in face of this report, recommend to the Cabinet that A.D.G.B. should maintain its absolute priority, or should they recommend sending some guns to
these ports ?  The figure he had suggested had been arrived at by deducting theexisting number of 3-inch guns at the three ports, namely,  18, from the figureof 48, which was the approved scale.  He would like the Committee to considerfor a moment the question of what guns were available.  He had been informedthat on the  1st January the number  of  3-7-inch guns was 150, and that on the1st March, if 4-5-inch were added, the number would have risen to 290.  In thelight of this rate of progress he  suggested  that the Committee might considerwhether 30 guns could be spared.    MR. BRIDGES suggested that  a useful way of  considering the question would be in terms of its effect on monthly output.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the production could be put, at its lowest,at 40 guns a month.    MR. BRIDGES said in that case  every 10 guns  diverted to ports abroadmight be said to retard the completion of the A.D.G.B. programme by one week.    LORD  HALIFAX said that, although he had the greatest sympathy for theproblems which beset the Secretary of State for War,  he none  the less felt thatit was impossible to resist the conclusion that something should be provided formaltality.    LORD  STANHOPE said that  if  Malta were not  properly  protected theforces  in Palestine  could not be maintained.    MR. HORE-BELISHA  said he  would  like to correct the impression that200 anti-aircraft guns were  with the Regular Army.  The  correct figures were96, all of which were 3-inch, and 24 of them had been sent to Alexandria. Duringthe crisis he had wanted to move  his Regular guns to London, and he had foundthat some of the guns were in Egypt and that he  had not sufficient men to manthe others.  The Committee  must remember that  the Army was on  a voluntary basis and was 20,000 men short.    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said  he thought the Committee might  agree onthe number of guns which  should be  diverted to these ports from A.D.G.B.,and might  then leave  the Chiefs of  Staff to decide the actual  distribution.  Hesuggested that twenty-five would be  a  useful contribution.    MR. HORE-BELISHA  said that a decision could be taken in two minutesto send  guns  somewhere, but it  takes months  to  get  more  guns.   He  had justhad a request for authority to order the 320 guns, which he had been authorisedafter the crisis to obtain, rejected by  the  Chancellor of the Exchequer.  this authority might soon be obtained, but the three months&apos; delay which had takenplace would have its effect when in a year&apos;s time they might be considering similarproposals for the allocation of guns.  He also required authority for the provisionof personnel and accommodation.     SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that if  the view of the  Committee was thatthere  should  be some acceleration,  he felt certain  that  the difficulties  overaccommodation and personnel could  be got  over.     MR.  HORE-BELISHA said that  it was  the War  Office policy  to employas far as possible local personnel, but they still only had authority at these ports to provide in peace half the personnel for coast defence armament and two-thirdsfor anti-aircraft.  If it was the wish  of the Committee, he could put forward proposals to the Cabinet showing what he could do  to provide equipment forthese ports more rapidly.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said  that the Air Ministry  could  also examine and report on the possibility of accelerating  the provision  of  R.D.F.  and a squadron of the Royal Air Force for Malta.     SIR ROGER BACKHOUSE  said that in view of the delay which must occur  before  Bofors guns were  available,  he  was considering allocating someof the  2-pdr.  guns, at present earmarked for the protection of merchant ships,to naval  establishments  as a temporary measure.
TRichmond  Terrace,  S. W. 1,    January 26, 1939.                                CONCLUSIONS.         -    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed :     (a) To recommend to the  Cabinet that some modification of the decision*           that absolute priority should be given to the provision of anti-aircraft           defences  for  Great Britain should  be made in order to permit of           acceleration in the provision of A.A.  equipment and R.A.F. squadrons           for the defences of  Malta, Gibraltar and Aden.    (b) To invite the  Secretary of State for War to  submit to the  Cabinet for           simultaneous consideration a statement of  the amount of acceleration           which he is prepared to  recommend, having regard to  the  rate of           production  of A.A. equipment, the provision and training of personnel,           and the financial limitations at present imposed.    (c) To invite the Secretary of State for Air also  to submit to the Cabinet a           statement of the present position regarding the supply of R.D.F. to           Malta, and squadrons of  aircraft to Malta and Aden, and to make           proposals for acceleration.    (d) To take  note  that the Admiralty  would investigate and report to the           Minister  for  Co-ordination of Defence on  the possibility of  making           available, as  a temporary  measure,  2-pdr. guns for  the defence of           Malta, Gibraltar and Aden against low-flying air attack.    (e) That the Chiefs of Staff should be; authorised  to determine the allocation           as between  the  three ports in question, of such accelerated equipment           as may result from the Cabinet decisions on (a),  (b) and (c) above.    *  Cabinet 48 (37),  Conclusion  9, and 49 (37), Conclusion 1, on CP. 316 (37), paragraph 61(Enclosure to D.P. (P) 15).&quot;                                                       *it&quot;
