                                  No. 1.Sir E. Phipps&apos;s record of the meeting with the French Ministers at the Quai  ii d&apos;Orsay  on the afternoon  of  January 10, and  enclosing the comrrtunique    issued after the meeting.(No. 50.   Confidential.)                          Paris, January 11, 1939.My Lord,    I HAVE the honour to place  on record that the conversations between thePrime  Minister and your Lordship, on the  one hand, and M.  Daladier  andM.  Bonnet, on  the other, took place yesterday  afternoon from about 6-15 to7 o&apos;clock.  M.  Leger, Sir Alexander Cadogan and I were  present.    2.   The proceedings were of course of a quite informal  character, not evenround a table, and no notes were taken, but it may be well if I forward the gist of what  passed in the memorandum enclosed herein.    3.   It will be noticed that the only action to be taken by your Lordship&apos;department is  to sound the German Government regarding  their guarantee ofC zechoslovakia.    4.   I enclose, herein, the text of the agreed communique issued to the pressafter the conversations were over.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                        ERIC PHIPPS.                               Memorandum.France and Italy.    M.  DALADIER made it quite clear  that  the French Government wouldnot make any concessions at all to Italy.  Indeed,  even  if he wished to do so he would not be able, since the Italian Government  had succeeded in producingan &apos;&apos; union sacree &apos;&apos;;  any French Government attempting in these circumstances to make concessions would be swept away (&quot; serait balaye &quot;.).  The whole attitudeof the Italian Government and press had been intolerable, and was  quite incom-prehensible in view of the  fact that the French Government had done all theycould for their part  to put relations on a  better footing and had appointed a french Ambassador  to Rome, thus recognising  the  Italian  Empire of Ethiopiawithout exacting any Italian concession in exchange.  No sooner had M. Francois-Poncet  arrived  in  Rome,  however,  than  he  had been insulted by  hostiledemonstrations instigated by the Italian Government.    The Prime  Minister said that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government had of  coursenoted and regretted the sudden change which had come over the Italian attitude.He wondered  what was its true significance.  Had it any connexion with the project which Herr Hitler was said to have in his mind in  regard to the Ukraine ?M. Bonnet agreed that this might very well be the case and that the design wasto keep France occupied in the  Mediterranean, thus  leaving Germany  free to attain her objective  in Eastern Europe.    M. Bonnet said he had made it clear to Herr von Ribbentrop  when the lattercame  to  Paris that  the French  Government had no  intention  of  making any concessions to Italy.   He had spoken in similar, though even stronger, terms tothe German Ambassador on the 31st December.    M.  Leger remarked that, from highly placed  circles in Berlin, the Quaid&apos;Orsay  had derived  the impression that the Germans wished France to stand firm in this matter.  If, however,  France were to weaken, then the &quot;Germans would come down heavily on the Italian side in order to claim the credit for any Frenchconcessions to Italy.    Lord Halifax asked whether  the  French Ministers  approved  the  attitude that the Prime Minister and he proposed to adopt in &quot;Rome in the matter ofFranco-Italian relations (as set  forth in the memorandum  handed by Sir EricPhipps to M. Bonnet on the 9th January, in accordance with  the instructionscontained in Foreign Office telegram No. 5, Saving, to Paris of the 6th January).The French Ministers expressed entire agreement.  The Prime Minister explained
that questions not contemplated in the above memorandum might  arise in thecourse of the Eome conversations, and  the  French Ministers said they quiteunderstood this.  In illustration of his point the Prime Minister observed  that,although he  had no information  to show  what Signor  Mussolini  might  beintending to  propose, it might be,  for instance, that he would offer  to withdrawall his Italian troops from Spain in exchange for the grant of belligerent rights to General Franco.Spain.    The French Ministers expressed concern at MussolinFs refusal to give thesame  assurances regarding the territorial inviolability of Spain, her islands and her colonies as he had given to Great Britain.  Did this mean that he regretted the assurances given to Great Britain in the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and thathe meant to violate them ?  It might be well  to ask the Duce in Eome to repeatthose assurances. M. Bonnet went on to say  that, although it was true that theItalian Government had undertaken at the close of the hostilities  to withdrawentirely from Spanish territory, there was no assurance that this pledge wouldbe carried Out, and he enquired what His Majesty&apos;s Government would do in the  &quot;event of the Italian Government failing to keep their word. The Prime Ministerobserved that that was a difficulty that  would have to be faced if and when itarose; but M. Bonnet at  least did not seem satisfied and reverted to the point ata later stage of the conversation,  when the  Prime Minister  assured him thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government attached not less importance  to the point than did&apos;the French Government.     The Prime Minister and Lord Halifax  thought that this would  not get usmuch further.  To ask the Duce to repeat his assurances would merely elicit verbalpromises in  the same sense as the assurances already obtained in writing.  Itwould appear to be better on  this  particular point to wait and see.  It seemeddifficult to believe that Mussolini, who had shown such anxiety to put  the Anglo-Italian Agreement  into  force,  should intend flagrantly  to  violate  it  by any permanent military occupation of Majorca, or any other part of Spanish territory.    The French Ministers thought it would be highly desirable to urge Mussoliniin Rome to withdraw at any rate  all his soldiers from Spain.  They were being subjected to  growing criticism from their Left for the continued closing of  thePyrenean frontier despite the sending of Italian reinforcements and supplies ofarms, munitions, &amp;.c, to Franco  Spain.  Negrin had set the good example in thisrespect, for he had  sent away large numbers of foreigners.    M. Leger observed that a couple of days  previously the Spanish ambassador had addressed a note to the French Government, pointing out that the SpanishGovernment  did not, once hostilities had ceased, wish to follow an anti-italian policy.  On the contrary, their aim was to be friendly to all the MediterraneanPowers.  The Spanish Ambassador had, it seemed,  informed the Quai  d&apos;Orsaythat  a  similar note had been  addressed to  His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  lord halifax and Sir A. Cadogan replied  that, though they had  not seen any suchnote,  the Spanish Ambassador  in  London had spoken  in the same  sense morethan  once.Czechoslovakia.     The French Ministers indicated that they would like a joint  guarantee of czechoslovakia by the four Munich Powers.  This would  only come into play ifthree of the four guaranteeing Powers were in agreement.   The  inconvenient,and, indeed,  dangerous, situation now obtaining would then come to an end.  Atpresent Great Britain and France were bound ^by their guarantees  of  Czecho-slovakia, whilst Germany and  Italy were quite^free.  It was then agreed thatthe Prime Minister and Lord  Halifax would  raise this question in Rome andthat it should also be raised at Berlin by the  British and French representatives.     M. Leger thought it would be well to clear away certain German  doubts andsuspicions in this matter, and to point out  to the&apos; German  Government that aguarantee such as was now suggested would  not  in any way  be directed against them.     M. Bonnet remarked in this connexion that Herr von Ribbentrop  in  Parishad shown great reserve in this matter of a guarantee, and had objected thatCzechoslovakia might some day be hostile again  to Germany and might even be governed by &quot; another Benes.&quot;

De passage a Paris, se rendant a Rome, le Premier Ministre et Lord Halifaxont saisi cette occasion pour s&apos;entretennsau  Quai d&apos;Orsay avec M. Daladier etM. Georges Bonnet.    Cette conversation a  permis  de  confirmer pleinement 1&apos;identite generale devues anterieurement etablie entre  les  deux Gouvernements.    10 Janvier 1939.                                  No. 2.Record of the First Conversation with Signor Mussolini and Count Ciano at the               Palazzo Venezia on the afternoon of January 11.     THE meeting took place in the Duce&apos;s room in the Palazzo Venezia, in the corner of which stands his writing desk. He sat on one side of this desk; on theother side, from  left to right, sat Count Ciano, the Prime  Minister and  theForeign Secretary.  The Duce had before him a double sheet of  foolscap, on whichhe had written in his own hand some notes, which he appeared to consult.     After  expressing  his pleasure at the  visit of the  British  Ministers, he observed that he wished to make a declaration, and preferred to speak in Italian,which would be translated by Count Ciano. He then proceeded with the declara-tion, beginning by  a statement that the policy  of  Italy was  peace, which wasnecessary to them for internal reasons,  including the development of their AfricanEmpire, as well as for the general  stability of Europe.  He said that this policy ofpeace was one which they intended to  pursue, and that he himself would gladlyuse his influence  in favour  of it if at any time the necessity arose.  He thenremarked that another  European war would mean the destruction of civilisation.Signor Mussolini said that the Berlin-Rome Axis was an essential point of italian policy, but this did not  imply that he could not have, as he hoped to have, the most friendly relations with Great Britain and with other Powers when circumstance were favourable or  that good relations were not possible between  Germany andFrance.  He alluded to the Four-Power Pact  which he had previously supportedin vain.  He said  that he would not again take the initiative in suggesting such a pact, although he did not disapprove of it in principle.  The Prime Minister inter-iected that the Duce had already given proof of his willingness and ability to intervene in favour of peace, and he had no doubt that his services could be relied upon again in case of need.     The Duce then proceeded  to speak of  the  Mediterranean, as to which heremarked that Italy was  quite satisfied with the Anglo-Italian Agreement onthis subject, by which  they intended to stand, and that they did not  consider itnecessary or desirable to bring in  other nations in a general Mediterranean Pact.He repeated emphatically  that they- intended to stand loyally by their obligations under the Agreement,  and rather went out of his  way to stress that when theSpanish conflict was over they would have nothing to ask from Spain.  He spokewith satisfaction  of  the exchange of military information which had taken place the day before.     Speaking of  Franco-Italian relations, he said  that the Italian government did  not consider  that the Agreement of 1935  was still  in  force.  The greatbarrier between France and Italy was the Spanish question, on which they tookopposite views, and, until that was out of the way, no negotiations would bepossible.   He  complained  that  the   French were sending  assistance  to  the republican Government,  but did not  enter  into any  detail as to the nature ofthis assistance, except that several  times he  repeated that  the  French were sending in flour.  He said that Franco should be given belligerent rights at once;that it was quite absurd to treat as a rebel a man who was in possession of three-quarters of Spain&apos;s territory.     Signor Mussolini  then  spoke of disarmament. He  said  he was of  opinionthat a  general disarmament was not  practical  politics, but  that,  on the otherhand, it should be possible to obtain agreement on qualitative limitation of arma-ments, to be followed later on by quantitative limitation.  This, however, wouldbe conditional upon agreement among the Four Munich Powers.  On this thePrime Minister asked whether&apos;the Duce would consider the agreement of  russia would be essential to the working of such limitations, and the Duce said that ifthe  Four Powers were in  agreement, Russia would  not matter.  The  Prime
Minister interjected that if, say, a qualitative limitation upon the size of bombingaeroplanes, were agreed to by the Four Powers and Russia paid no attention to it,but continued to construct machines outside the agreed limit, Would not this breakup  the agreement between the Four  Powers?  He added that he had asked thequestion because he had put a similar question to Herr  Hitler, who had repliedthat disarmament agreements must be world wide; it would be with the air  as ithad been with the Navy.  Once Japan refused to agree  to Naval limitation, theagreement between the other Powers was broken up and so it would be with theair. Signor Mussolini looked as if he was somewhat shaken by this, but did not make any further comment at variance with what he had said before.  He againrepeated that if  any proposal for limitation, were  made  by others,  he would support it.     At this point, the Duce folded up his notes  and appeared to have come toan  end.  The Prime  Minister asked if he  would say anything about the refugeeproblem.  The Duce  said that the Jewish refugee problem was not a local one,but one of general application. It was already not a problem in Germany  only,and he thought probably  it would be bound to arise in many  other countries,including the United Kingdom. At this point he broke into a broad smile and saidthat that was his opinion.     The best permanent solution would be the establishment of an independentSovereign Jewish State, which would not  require that all Jews should live in it,since, as subjects of  such a State,  they would have their status and their officialrepresentation in whatever country they lived, like other people.  To find a place for such a State, one must look to  the countries that had large areas of territorysuch as the United States of America, Soviet Russia or Brazil.  He  said,  withsome indication of irony, that it might be some time before such a solution was practicable, but it must he regarded as a long-term aim.  The Foreign Secretarythen enquired whether it would not be possible to persuade the German Govern-ment to make some effort to facilitate the departure of  the Jews from germany by  allowing them to  take some money out  with them. Signor Mussolini thoughtit would be so possible, but that it would not be  of much use to ask for a greatdeal as the Germans had suffered  great hardships and had become very poor inconsequence of the actions of the Jews.  He  thought, however, that they  were quite determined to get rid of them and would be very ready to do anything theycould that would expedite  their  departure, provided a large-scale plan could be formulated.   He himself would be prepared to use any influence he might have in  that direction.  The Prime Minister asked how the Duce contemplated thatthe next step should be taken; would it not be for Mr. Rublee of the international commission to approach the German  Government in the first instance %  The  Duceagreed, especially as this  was an  international affair which  could not be solved by any one State alone.     The Prime Minister then said he would like to make a few comments  uponthe Duce&apos;s observations.  To  begin  with, he  wished on behalf of himself andthe Foreign Secretary to thank Signor Mussolini  very warmly for his  invitation,which it had given  them  great pleasure  to accept.  He had felt that, when heparted with  Signor  Mussolini at  Munich, he had not seen enough of him, andwas extremely glad to have an opportunity  of renewing the acquaintance whichwas then begun.  He and the Foreign Secretary were gratified by what the  Ducehad said on  the subject of peace and the Italian desire for a peaceful policy.The Duce would know how  warmly he  agreed with  the view which he had expressed.  He had been obliged to suffer the disappointment  of seeing the resultof his careful finance over many years dissipated in building armaments insteadof  in making improvements in public health and  in the  conditions of the people,and it was therefore natural that he earnestly desired to see the time come  when this form of  spending money could be exchanged for something more reasonable.The Duce gave strong signs of assent while the Prime Minister was saying this.The Prime Minister at this stage said that after Munich he had hoped that itwould be possible  to  continue  conversations with the  German government towards the end of last year, but he had been very disappointed in their attitude.Herr Hitler had made no response  whatever to the friendly observations which he,the Prime Minister, had  made,  and then incidents had occurred which hadrendered it  quite impossible to  carry on  any  negotiations whatever for  themoment.  Nevertheless,  he did not despair, but thought  it would be necessary to wait some time and then perhaps it might be possible to find a better atmosphere
in which to resume talks&apos;.   The Duce gave no indication of his view as to the behaviour  of  the  German  Government  after Munich, but he  stated  that there actions of British public opinion on the subject of what was after all a matterof internal policy in Germany,-namely, the persecution of the Jews, had provokednatural reactions.   At the same time he agreed that it should be  possible later onto resume conversations, and he hoped&apos;that this would be done.     The Prime Minister then went on to express his pleasure at the renewedassurance given by the Duce of  his intention to stand by  the  Anglo-italian agreement.  He had never  doubted his intention in this respect, but, of course,it was pleasant to hear the assurance renewed and he knew that the  foreign secretary would be as glad as he  was.   .     Coming to relations with Trance, the Duce would understand his deep regret that they did  not  seem to  be progressing. very well.   He was puzzled at the objection to the 1935 Treaty, which he had understood was considered satisfactory in every respect, except in regard to Spain.   He  recognised that the  Spanishquestion was extremely important, and he would be very glad if it were possibleto see some way of putting an end to that conflict.   The Duce had spoken aboutthe assistance being given to the Government  side from Prance, but the Frenchtold us equally of  assistance being given to the Nationalist  side by Italy andGermany.  The Duce said he had withdrawn 10,000 men, to which  the PrimeMinister said &quot; but not aviators or artillery.&quot;  The Duce then said that  they hadnot increased  their artillery, or their aviators,  or their aeroplanes for several months past.   The Prime  Minister asked Count  Ciano to repeat  this  lastobservation, which he did in the same words.    The Foreign Secretary then  observed that it  would be very difficult to see how the conflict was going to end when each side continually asserted and believedthat the other side was receiving assistance which  it was their duty or necessity to counter.  The Duce said that he had always intended to stand by the Britishplan which had been adopted by  the Non-intervention Committee, and that if that were made operative the question would be settled.  If, however, the french were to begin, a large scale intervention on the side of the Government he wouldhave to reconsider his position.  The Prime Minister asked whether he had any reason to suppose that such a move was in contemplation as he had heard nothing of it.   The Duce said there had been some talk  of it.    The  Prime Ministerthen observed  that  it  was  General  Franco who  had declined to accept theplan and so made  it impossible.  The Prime Minister added  that, whilst he understood that it  would be of little use to ask General Franco to accept theBritish plan or to consent to the withdrawal,of foreign volunteers while he was actually in process of carrying out an extensive military operation, he would liketo know whether the Duce was of opinion that, supposing his present drive to be successful,  it would then be possible to get him to agree to the British plan?The Duce replied that if Franco  succeeded in taking Tarragona and Barcelonathe war would he  practically finished, and in that case he thought the BritishNon-intervention Plan could be  accepted  by General Franco, provided thatwithdrawal was properly controlled on both sides.    In reply to a  question as to how long the drive was likely  to continue, theDuce expressed the view that, whilst it depended upon the penetrative power ofthe Nationalists, it should be over in the course of a few weeks.  Asked by theForeign Secretary  whether, if all foreign troops were withdrawn, Franco wouldwin by himself, Spaniard against Spaniard, the Duce reflected  for a minute ortwo, and then, saying that this was a very difficult question to answer, concluded that, on the whole, he would.  The Prime Minister asked whether Franco&apos;s forces were not a good deal  divided, having different aims; for instance, the Requetesand the Falangists seemed to have very different purposes.   The Duce  thoughtthat, if Franco won, his prestige  would be so much increased that it would bepossible for him to bring these two parties together, each one abating something of their  extreme demands.   He  thought  that, if Franco won,  he would haveto modify his policy to  some extent, as he would have to rule the whole country.He (the Duce) had always used his influence with Franco on the side of humanityto prisoners and civilians. He had repeatedly sent him letters and telegrams, andhe considered that he had saved the lives of 50,000  persons in Bilbao, of whomotherwise very  few might have escaped.    The Prime Alinister then suggested that  the meeting should be adjourned,and it was agreed  to resume conversations at 5-30 the following day.
No. 3.Translation of Signor Mussolini&apos;s Speech at the Banquet at the Palazzo Venezia                        on the evening of January 11.          ;    I AM happy  to offer to you and Lord Halifax a cordial. welcome to Italyand  to  Rome on my own  part  and that of  the  Fascist  Government, who,  ingreeting you as welcome guests and representatives of a great  friendly nation,also  desire to indicate to you the sympathy with which the Italian  people has followed, and is following, your work and that of your Government.    Your spirit of understanding, the firmness with which you have personallycontributed to an  equitable solution of the problems which last September wereweighing down the life of Europe, the tenacity  with which you have carriedout a programme of reconciliation and peace, have found the most sincere appre-ciation in my country which has  always believed in a  peace founded on justice,which has been, and is, the ultimate objective at which  the policy of FascistItaly has aimed and will aim.    The Anglo-Italian agreements which have recently come into force have put the relations between Great Britain and Italy on a  solid basis, and not only have  they restored the friendship between our two countries on a new plane of understanding and in the light of the new Mediterranean  and African realities,but have opened the way to a collaboration which as a necessary element for peace in Europe we hope will be as lasting as it will be fruitful.    It  is with  these wishes to which  I add my  own most  sincere sentimentsof friendship for  you personally  that I raise, Excellency, my  glass in honour ofHis  Majesty, The  King of Great Britain,  Ireland, and&apos; the British dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India; to your health,  to the greatness and prosperity of your nation.                                   No. 4.  The Prime Ministers Reply to Signor Mussolini&apos;s Speech at the Banquet at              the. Palazzo Venezia on the evening of January 11.    I  HAVE  been  greatly touched by  the  cordial  sentiments which yourExcellency has just expressed  towards myself  and my country,  and both  theForeign Secretary and  myself  have been deeply  moved by the warmth  of  the reception accorded to us on our arrival in the capital of the Italian Empire.  Itis a real pleasure to both of us to  re-visit this  country and in  this city, whichthrough the ages has so notably inspired much of  man&apos;s highest thought andachievement, to see with our own eyes the new Italy, powerful and progressive,which has arisen under your Excellency&apos;s guidance and inspiration.    It is  as a representative of  a  great nation whose  desire it  is to remain onclose, friendly and even intimate relations with another great nation that I  amhere to-day.    Your Excellency has been good  enough to refer in flattering terms to my partin finding a solution of the problems which last September were weighing uponthe life of Europe.  I should like to repeat, what I have said before, that  we  are all deeply indebted  to  your Excellency for  your help and  co-operation whichcontributed so decisively to the peaceful result of the Munich Conference.    I have come here in pursuit of  the policy for  which I stand,  a policy of friendship with all and of enmity  with none, and a policy directed  to the just and peaceful solution of international difficulties by the method pf negotiation.I am happy to think that our two  Governments have been able to give concreteexpression to this policy, for it was in its spirit that they concluded last spring theAnglo-Italian Agreement,  which has just been put into force.  It is noteworthythat as one of the first fruits of this Agreement our two Governments were ableyesterday here and in London to proceed to the exchange of the military informa-tion for which  it provides.  Convinced as we  are that our  interests  in  theMediterranean, while of vital importance to  us both, yet need in no way conflict
with one another, we believe that that agreement has opened a new chapter of friendship and confidence between us which should prove fruitful for the futurestability of Europe.    Assuring your Excellency that I value highly your expressions of personalfriendship and with the hope that our two nations may together co-operate in thetask of securing  lasting peace  in Europe,  I raise my glass to His Majesty theKing of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia and to the continued welfare and prosperity of the  peoples over whom he rules.                                   No. 5. ;     Record of Secretary of State&apos;s Conversation with Count Ciano at the                Palazzo Chigi on  the Morning of January 12.    A MEETING took place between Count Ciano and the Foreign secretary on the morning of the  12th January.    After a little general conversation, Count Ciano asked Lord Halifax whether he had received the latest news from Spain, and proceeded to tell him that theItalian  Government had just received  an intimation that  General Franco had captured a further important strategic point that might be expected to exerciseconsiderable influence on the future progress of his offensive.  He went on  to saythat, though he was loth to make  precise prophecies  about dates which had sofrequently been falsified, it could now surely  be taken for certain that within six weeks, or six months or six years, General Franco  would win, and accordinglyit seemed to him inexplicable that the French should insist on maintaining  an attitude of such hostility to General Franco, and he could discern no intelligiblereason for it.  The Italian Government saw no reason to anticipate the emergence of any dangerous  complications from Spain  unless the French Government was so ill-advised as to resort to intervention on a really substantial  and organisedscale, in which event the Italian Government would be obliged to re-examine their whole attitude towards the  situation.    The Foreign Secretary said that he had no reason to suppose that the french had any such step in contemplation,  and would not be at all likely to take anysuch action, unless on the Italian side anything was done on such a scale as  would strongly excite French public opinion in such a sense.  As to the French attitude to General Franco, Lord Halifax  said that he had no doubt  that the FrenchGovernment  were  constantly in great difficulty from their own public opinion,just as  in varying degree the Prime  Minister  and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere in England, and that for the rest the anxiety that was very firmly rooted inthe French mind was lest at the conclusion of hostilities General Franco  mightbe found to pursue a  policy of hostility to French interests  and the ItalianGovernment  might be  found  anxious to maintain  their position at points  ofgreat strategic disadvantage to French interests.  If, therefore, it was in any way possible for the Italian Government to have regard to these natural anxieties,firstly, by not advertising more than was necessary the help that they were giving to General Franco, and, secondly, by giving any assurance to the French Govern-ment similar to that which  they had given to us, Lord Halifax would suppose itwould be likely that the French attitude arising from their present anxiety mightbe so far modified.    To all this  Count  Ciano  replied that, as Signor Mussolini had assured uslast night, the Italian Government would have no demands to make on Spain atthe conclusion of hostilities, that they would certainly try to get  back anythingthey could through the channels  of legitimate trade, but they would seek  noprivileged position, and certainly, as they had frequently  assured  us, had  no territorial designs.  If, indeed, they had had any  such, would  it not have been an obvious policy  for them to  endeavour to secure the division of Spain in order the more easily to extract advantages, territorial or other, for themselves? Thefact that they had not done this  but had directed  all their efforts towards themaintenance of a united Spain might surely be taken as a convincing  proof thatthey harboured no such ulterior ambitions.  &quot;While  the Italian  Government had always  recognised the  correctness  of the  position  we had adopted, and  while,therefore, they were prepared to be cross-examined by us as to what they were
 doing and to give us assurances, they were not prepared to be put in  the dock by the French Government, which,  they thought, as he added with a smile, had behaved every bit as badly, if not worse, than themselves.  It was on this point that the conversations with the French had broken off in May, and the Italian Government was not  disposed to recede from that attitude.   .     The  Foreign  Secretary  told  Count  Ciano  that he  had  been  greatly surprised to hear  him say last night that the  Italian Government  had not sent any further troops or artillery  or aeroplanes since  (as he, Lord  Halifax, had  understood) the  beginning of December.   It was  impossible for us  to check  with certainty  any information  coming  to us  in a  different sense, but  he  thought  it   right  to  tell  him  that  in  many  quarters   it  was strongly asserted that they had   in. fact  sent  very  considerable  supplies of ammunition and aeroplanes within the last  few weeks.    This Count Ciano strongly denied, saying that they had  at the  present time one effective division in Spain, and altogether  an Italian personnel of something like twenty or twenty-five thousand.  As regards artillery and  aviation, concerning which Lord Halifax had asked him whether what had been said last night implied that no further supplies had been sent or that such further supplies as had been sent represented only legitimate replacements, Count Ciano said that certainly no additional supplies had been sent, and that what had been sent amounted to, in his estimate, not much. more than a third of  what would have been capable of being held as legitimate replacement.  It might well be that aeroplanes were flown from Palma to Sardinia in order to have some  replacement of spare  parts, and these were quite possibly reckoned by those giving  information as  new machines when  they  returned to Palma.     Count Ciano warmly agreed with Lord Halifax that,  if only the Spanish problem could be settled, much of the difficulty of foreign affairs in Europe to-day would be removed, but in reply to a suggestion of his that, with General Franco now  occupying three-quarters of the country,  it should not  be  impossible to reach some compromise solution by which the future could  be assured against the establishment of  a  Communist  Government, he  said  that he  thought General Franco would have an  immense task at the conclusion of hostilities in the way of reconstruction of Spanish  national life, and that to enable him to discharge this successfully it was  important that  he should  not lack the prestige that would attach to a victor in the civil war.   He agreed with Lord Halifax that the social programme of  the  two sides  was  on paper very  much the  same,  but it was significant  that, during all the months of campaigning, the Government forces had never been  able to recapture any territory,  whereas during the last  offensive General Franco had captured territory which included 400,000 inhabitants, which gave him &quot; on a division,&quot; as compared with  the Government forces, an additional population of 800,000.HALIFAX.Rome, January 12, 1939.                                   No. 6.Record of the Second  Conversation  with Signor Mussolini  and Count Ciano           at  the Palazzo  Venezia on the afternoon of January 12.    THE second conversation took place on Thursday, the 12th, at 5-30 P.M.    Signor Mussolini began by saying that at this second conversation he wishedto put before  the British Ministers the attitude of  the Italian Government onFranco-Italian relations.   He  had already  informed them that they did notconsider the Treaty of 1935 to  be in force.  They had given the reasons  for this.in a despatch to the French which had been shown to Lord Perth and at  the endof this despatch they had offered to discuss their difficulties with  the  French,The French Government,  however,  had not accepted this invitation and in themeantime there had taken place the demonstration in the Italian Chamber whichwas entirely  spontaneous and  with which the Government had not associateditself.  They had not taken any notice of the demonstration, but since the french had hot accepted their offer they would not now take  the initiative in any  further negotiations or enter upon them until after the Spanish  affair was settled. then it might  be possible  to talk things  over, but,  in  the  meantime, a dangerous
situation existed on account of the violent attacks made by French papers aboutthe Duce, the Italian Army and everything Italian.  The Prime Minister said itwas not all the French papers, but only a  few of them that were thus attackingItaly, but the-Duce said most of them were.   The Prime Minister then repeatedwhat he understood to be the account which had just been given to him in orderto make-sure it was  correctly understood  and thanked the Duce for explainingso&apos; clearly what his position was.  He  also thought that the situation might be dangerous if the termination of the Spanish conflict were  delayed and he hopedvery much  that the Duce  on his side would restrain  any  activities on the partof the press or elsewhere which might tend  to exacerbate feelings.  He pointed outthat the British position with regard to France was just like that which existedbetween Italy and Germany, and that  these acute differences between Italy andFrance would be a source of grave  embarrassment to the British Governmentwhich wanted at the  same time to be improving  relations with Italy.  Finally, heremarked that, while the Governments of Italy and of  Great Britain were stable,no one could say the same of the French Government, and he  was anxious that nothing should be done which would weaken M. Daladier&apos;s  position and give an opportunity for the Left Wing to take control.  Signor Mussolini appearedcordially to agree  with the  last sentiment.  He did not think himself that theSpanish affair would take long, since  General  Franco&apos;s drive was progressingvery favourably, whereas the counter attack was a failure, but in the meantimehe would not make it harder  for France, and he intended to  stick by his agreementwith us.  &apos;J    The  Duce then  enquired whether there  was any  point  which   british ministers wished to raise.  The Prime Minister replied that he would like to elicitthe Duce&apos;s opinion upon a matter of some  delicacy, although if Signor Mussolinifelt that he preferred not  to answer the question, no doubt he would say so.  Ashe had said yesterday, he had hoped that after Munich, and  particularly afterthe Declaration signed by Herr  Hitler, it would be  possible to  proceed withdiscussions  designed  to put  relations between Germany and Great Britain on abetter footing.  Unfortunately, this had  not been found practicable,  and  theattitude of Germany was  giving rise to a great deal  of anxiety and doubt, notonly in his mind  but all over Europe.   Armament was proceeding  not onlyunchecked,  but at an increased pace.  .There  was  talk of massing troops, and ageneral suspicion that Herr Hitler had it in mind to make some  further move in the near future which would be likely to upset a great part of Europe.  Therewere different suggestions  as to the nature  of such a move.  Some people thoughtit would be in the direction of the Ukraine;  others that, although that might bethe ultimate aim, it  would be preceded by a  sudden attack in the West.  HereSignor Mussolini shook his head emphatically.  Probably most  people  thoughtthat the move, if made, would be towards the East, and they feared that it might mean a war between  Germany and Poland, or Germany and Russia, or germany with Poland and Russia combined. The Prime Minister would not say that sucha war would necessarily involve Western  Powers also, but once war began onenever could tell when or where it would stop.    Here Signor Mussolini indicated his assent.  Therefore, the Prime Ministerconcluded,  these rumours and suspicions were undermining  all  confidence inEurope; they were driving every country into increased programmes of rearmament -ment and as long as they continued there seemed little hope of improvement in thesituation.   What he would like to know was whether the Duce could give him anyassurances  which  would  do something to mitigate  his  anxiety  on this very important matter.   Signor Mussolini appeared to consider his answer carefullyand then he replied slowly and with pauses between the sentences.  He said thatit was true that Germany had rearmed and was still  rearming, but that he was convinced that this was only for defensive  purposes and that Herr Hitler desireda long period  of peace in order that he might fuse together the component partsof the expanded Reich and develop its productive forces. He thought it was verypossible that these rumours were being  spread about by propagandists anxious tomake mischief and to put Germany in the wrong.  He did  not believe that hitler had any intention of setting up an independent Ukraine or  of attempting to bringabout the disruption of Russia, although  he, Mussolini, would not feel that  itwould be a bad thing if an independent Ukraine were created and it certainlywould not be  to the  disadvantage of the  Russians.   He would like to  mention that Italy did  not favour a common frontier between Hungary and Poland because
the frontiers had been laid down on ethnical principles and the Ruthenians wereneither Poles nor Hungarians.   The interview which Hitler and Beck had had recently  at  Berchtesgaden had improved  the situation as between  these two parties and again he repeated that in his view these stories about a move eastwardby Germany were without foundation and probably started deliberately by propa-gandists.  As to any idea of a German attack  in the west, such a thing was absolutely out of the question.  Hitler would never send the youth of Germanyto fall on the frontier which he regards as already decided.    The  Prime  Minister observed that these  views of the Duce were  good sofar as they went, but, nevertheless he did not feel that they were quite sufficientto account for the uneasy situation or to exclude further suspicion.  There wasthe overwhelming  fact that German military forces  were  now  so strong as tomake  it  impossible  for  any Power or combination  of Powers to  attack  hersuccessfully.  She  could  not want  further  armaments for defensive purposes;what  then did she want  them for ?  Russia could not be an enemy to be fearedby Germany for she was far too weak internally to take the offensive, althoughshe might  put up a very good  defence  if she were  attacked.  It was such considerations as these which continually bred suspicion among  other countries.To this the Duce replied that the Germans had to take into account the possibility that there might be another anti-German  coalition like that which had crushedher in 1918.  Moreover,  in measuring armaments one  must take account  of the size of the population to be defended and with 80 million of people, the Germansnaturally wanted larger armaments.  Moreover, they had been  entirely disarmedand they had had to start from the very bottom.  The Prime Minister then askedwhether if Herr Hitler&apos;s intentions were really so peaceful and his preparationsentirely defensive, he could be induced to say  something to  that effect  whichmight help to restore confidence. Signor Mussolini added a further consideration which had  occurred to  him as proving the  defensive nature  of the  Germanpreparations, namely, the fortification of the  Siegfried Line.   He said that itwas not  impossible that  Hitler might some time make some pacific  declaration and, indeed, he had just said something of the sort when receiving the diplomatic corps.  He  said the Prime Minister would have  to  remember  that there werepeople who  wanted the defeat  of Germany in other countries and that he, theFuhrer,   was responsible  for  the  lives of  Germans.   There  were people,  forinstance, in Britain and in France, like  Blum, who had  openly  declared thatthey would  like to have an alliance against  Germany and there was talk ofFrance supplying  the  Army and  Britain  the Navy  to effect  her defeat. ThePrime Minister  observed that M. Blum  spoke  only of a defensive and not of an offensive  alliance and that, though he would not speak for France, he could saywith  the utmost confidence that in his  own country no single person, not evenChurchill himself, ever thought of  taking  the offensive against Germany. TheDuce  retorted that no one doubted Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s will for peace, but theFuhrer had  to take account of  the fact that there were other views which mightsome day prevail, but he was sure that Germany would never attack either france or Great Britain and that Hitler wanted good  relations with Great  Britain as was shown by the Naval Agreement under which he had voluntarily  acceptedthe position of  inferiority at  sea.   He, Mussolini, would never accept such aposition  in  regard to France.  Here he thrust  out  his chin for the only time during their interviews  and looked aggressive.   He  concluded  by saying that,after  all, France had still got  a military  alliance with Poland and with SovietRussia and  Hitler must  reckon with these  things.    The Prime Minister then turned again to disarmament. Yesterday they had discussed the question of disarmament, and to-day the Duce had clearly statedthat it would be impossible for good relations to be restored between Italy  andFrance until the Spanish affair was out of the way.   Supposing then  that theSpanish  affair were settled and that good relations were once more established between  France and Italy, would  the  Duce  think that  a suitable moment to initiate discussions about qualitative disarmament ?  The Duce replied that verypossibly  it might  be, but he did not think it advisable to have any conferencewithout  previous  preparation,  as  it was  a matter that wanted a good deal of thought.  He had been  thinking about it,  but  he was not at present  ready tomake a move, although he had some ideas.  The Prime Minister responded thathe, too,  was against conferences entered  upon without  previous preparation.They were apt to  fail and do more harm than good, but all he had meant was to       [18489]                                                      D
enquire whether, in the opinion of the Duce, the moment that he had alluded to would be suitable for this preliminary exchange  of views.  The Duce said yes,he thought it would be, and he had been thinking a great deal about limitationin various ways.  You could have ships limited to not more than a certain tonnage,guns  limited to certain calibres, aeroplanes  not allowed to carry bombs of morethan  a certain  weight, prohibition of gas or the bombing of  civilians, &amp;c.  ThePrime Minister expressed his agreement with this method of approach  to theproblem, and hoped that when the time did come the Duce would be prepared to exchange views with the British Government in the preliminary stages, as hethought  some discussion between the two Governments might be very fruitful.The Duce said  he was quite prepared to do this, and that when the time came hewould formulate a draft which he would be prepared to discuss with a view to an exchange of ideas.    The Prime Minister  then  said he wished  to raise  the question  of theguarantee to Czechoslovakia.  This had been discussed and settled in principle atMunich,  but since then it had remained in  a rather vague form, and he  wouldlike to know what views Signor Mussolini had upon the subject.  The Duce saidthat he was not unfavourable in principle to such a  guarantee, but he did notthink the time had yet come, for Czechoslovakia was now a national State,  and itreally must be neutral before  the guarantee could be given.  The Prime ministers aid this had always been the idea of  the  British Government, and he fully recognised that only  by neutrality could Czechoslovakia hope  to preserve her position.  The  question, however, was, when that was  settled, by whom  wouldshe be guaranteed ?  He rather assumed that the Duce was thinking of the four powers.  Signor Mussolini said he was quite agreeable to the idea of the four powers giving a guarantee.  Clearly, however, to be effective, the guarantee mustbe given  by the  limitrophe Powers.  Powers which did not adjoin Czechoslovakiamight come  in,  but their effect would be moral rather than material.  The  PrimeMinister  said  that  another  practical  question  would, however,  arise.   Theguarantee was not a guarantee of frontiers,  but a guarantee against unprovoked aggression.  If  it became effective, it must be embodied in a clause in  the treaty,and  this  clause must define  the  procedure and  conditions  under  which theguarantee came into operation;  thus someone must decide whether an aggression,if it took place, was or was not unprovoked.  Who was to make this decision?The guarantee might be either joint or several.  If it were joint, a decision by allfour Powers would be necessary, but supposing that one  of the Powers itself wasthe aggressor ?   If unanimity were necessary in order  to establish the  guarantee,obviously that unanimity could not be obtained by the agreement of the aggressor,and consequently the guarantee would become ineffective.   For these  reasons, ithad occurred to the British Government that the nature of the aggression mightbe decided by a majority of the Powers, viz., three out of four.  What did theDuce  think  of this idea?  The Duce said this was a  matter  which was of con-siderable importance  and no doubt  it would have to be settled, but it  wrouldrequire some thought and consideration before a decision could be arrived at.  Inthe meantime, it might be considered who was likely to attack Czechoslovakia..Not Poland; she was not likely to make any attack;  nor Roumania, who had nothing to gain by it; nor Hungary.  He did not think Russia would attack, andGermany had shown that she regarded herself now as the protector of Czecho-slovakia;  so that he did not think it was likely that there would be an attack on her from any side.    The  Prime Minister then asked whether, in Signor Mussolini&apos;s view, itwas  desirable  to leave  this  question of  the guarantee open  for  the present.The Duce replied that before a guarantee could be considered he thought three questions must be settled.    1. The internal constitution of Czechoslovakia itself.    2. The establishment of her neutrality,  and    3. The  demarcation of her frontiers on the  ground,  for  hitherto they had          only been shown on maps.    When these conditions were fulfilled, a guarantee might be considered but,in the meantime, owing to the actions of Germany and Italy it was  consideredthat Central Europe would remain quiet.    The  Duce then asked whether the British Government were ready to discussthe adjustments of boundaries between Ethiopia and British Somaliland and theSudan in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.  The Prime Minister
said that they were and that the procedure which had suggested itself to  them was that a memorandum should be sent through Lord Perth of the adjustmentsdesired.   The Italian  Government could  then make  proposals for any adjust-ments  desired on  their side and  His Majesty&apos;s  Government would  then  send out to  Rome a commission of experts  who could discuss with the Italian expertsthe final method of adjusting the frontiers.  The Duce said he was quite agreeable.to this proposal, but observed that these were all quite minor matters.     The Prime Minister then said that there were no further questions whichhe wished to raise,  but he  would like to inform the  Duce that  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be delighted  to be  represented at the Rome Exhibition in1942.     The Duce then asked about the prospects of a general election in the UnitedKingdom; when was it likely to take place?  The Prime Minister said it wasnot due until the Autumn of 1940, and he saw no reason to suppose that it wouldtake place, at any rate, before the Autumn of the current year.     The Duce  then said that he would like  once  again to thank the british ministers for coming to Rome.  He had been very pleased with the conversations which he hoped would  further establish good relations and lead the way towardsgeneral peace.     The Prime Minister responded  in turn by thanking the Duce  again forthe pleasure which he had  given to  the British  Ministers  in  giving them theopportunity of making this visit.  They  had been  greatly gratified at  theircordial reception, and  he himself felt that the personal contact which they had established with the Head of the Government and his Ministers was of supremevalue as would be shown in their future relations.  The interview them terminated.                                   No. 7.Mr.  Osborne&apos;s Record of the Audiences of the Prime Minister and Lord Halifax     with His  Holiness the  Pope  and the  Cardinal Secretary of  State on     January 13.(No. 7.)                                    British Legation to the Holy See,My Lord,                                      Rome, January 13, 1939.     I HAVE the honour to submit a report on this morning&apos;s audience with the pope.     2.  During and after the luncheon which subsequently took place at HisMajesty&apos;s Legation, the Prime Minister and Secretary of State were able to haveconversations with the Cardinal Secretary of State and Cardinal Pizzardo, bothof whom expressed to  His  Majesty&apos;s Minister  their great pleasure  at  this opportunity and their enthusiastic appreciation of the qualities of the two british ministers.     3.  I believe that this appreciation was  mutual, and I am sure that the samecan be said of the audience with the Pope, who unmistakably displayed his cordialgoodwill and his enjoyment of the visit paid  to him.  I think it can fairly be saidthat from every point of view the morning devoted to the Vatican was well worthwhile.  To have omitted the courtesy visit to  the Pope would have deeply offendedand  hurt the Pope, the Vatican and  Catholics throughout the world.  There wasa very considerable crowd in the Piazza of St. Peter&apos;s waiting to see the PrimeMinister and  Lord  Halifax,  and there were smaller collections of  people at intervals along the route.  If the Italian papers had not announced that the party was  to be fetched from the Villa Madama instead of from the  Legation  I am surethe numbers would have been even greater.   The Romans  have a traditionaldevotion to the  Pope and deeply resented Hitler&apos;s ignoring of him on the occasion of his visit to Rome last spring.  The unmistakably spontaneous enthusiasm with-which the people greeted Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Halifax on their way to andfrom the  Vatican was  very  striking.   It seemed to express a warm  affectionfor the  Prime  Minister  and  his Secretary of State, a convinced faith in theirinspiration and motives and a resolute belief in the success of their  efforts onbehalf of peace and goodwill.                                                  I have,  &amp;c.                                                       D. G. OSBORNE.[18489]
                             Enclosure in No. 7.     THE Prime Minister, the Secretary of State, His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Holy See,  Mr.  Cleverly, Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr.  Maurice  Ingram,  Head of  the Southern Department, Foreign  Office, Mr. Oliver Harvey, Private Secretary to the Secretary of State and Mr. Charles Peake of the News Department, Foreign Office, left the British Legation to the Holy See at 11-30 in four Vatican cars which had been sent  to meet-them.  As there would have been no time for the necessary returns to the Villa Madama, the  party  were  wearing  morning-coats  and . striped  trousers instead of  the conventional evening-dress; there was a  precedent  for this in a  visit paid to Pope Benedict XV by Mr. Asquith in 1916, but  the concession was only tacitly accepted by the  Vatican authorities  on the present occasion.  In the first car were the Prime Minister and Sir Martin Melvin, an English Papal Chamberlain; in the second the Secretary of State, Mr. Osborne and another Chamberlain, while the rest of the party followed in the other two cars.  The Italian motor-cyclist police accompanied the cars as far as the entrance to the precincts of the Vatican, where they waited until  the cars emerged on the return journey.     On arrival in the great courtyard and at the entrance to the Grand Stairway other Papal  Chamberlains and officials received the  British  Ministers,  and  a procession was formed to the Papal  Apartments on the second floor.   Here, in the great entrance hall of the Sala Clementina, large numbers of British Catholic students from the English, Beda, Scots and Canadian  colleges, as well as from other institutions, were drawn up along the length of one side  of the  Sala.  The Rectors  of  the  British   Colleges  were  present  and were  presented  to Mr.  Chamberlain and Lord Halifax by Monsignor Godfrey, Rector of the English College and  newly  appointed  Apostolic  Delegate to the United  Kingdom. Permission had  been given to the students, who came  from all  parts of  the Empire,  to  salute  the  British Ministers, which  they  did  with enthusiastic cheering.  This arrangement  was a very kindly concession on the part of  the Vatican  authorities, for the vast majority of the students would  have had no other opportunity of seeing Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Halifax.     When  the  procession reached the  Private  Anti-Chamber, after passing through various rooms and being saluted by detachments of the Swiss, Noble and Papal Guards as well as by a considerable number of Officers of the Guards, Chamberlains and  other  officials  all in  full  uniform, it   Avas  received byMonsignor  A rborio-Mella, the Pope&apos;s Master of the  Chambers.   immediately thereafter the Prime Minister, Lord Halifax and Mr. Osborne were ushered intothe Pope&apos;s study.  His Holiness was awaiting them standing, and, after shakinghands with  them, invited them to sit down.  The party was then joined by Monsignor  Hurley, an American ecclesiastic in  the Secretariat of State.   the pope spoke in Italian and Monsignor Hurley translated  for him  into English; the substantial  part  of what His Holiness  had to say was read from  typescript,first  by the Pope in  Italian and then by Monsignor Hurley in English.  It hadbeen intended that Mr. Osborne should translate the British  Ministers&apos; repliesfrom English into  Italian,  but it was  fortunately  soon  apparent  that HisHoliness, though he  can  only speak a few  words  of  English, was perfectly ableto understand what Mr. Chamberlain  and Lord Halifax said to him without the aid of an interpreter.     The translation of His Holiness&apos;s statements is as follows :         &apos;&apos; Having the good fortune to receive two such illustrious  guests as his    Excellency  Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Halifax while the New Year is still    in its beginning, we desire first of all  to extend to them our most gladsome    good wishes, and not to them alone, but in their persons also to their august     Sovereigns and  to all England,  which they  are so worthily  authorised  to    represent, and which we have so much at heart not  only for its greatness and    importance, but also for  the great religious interests which we have both    in its vast dominions and dependent countries throughout  the world and in    the great homeland.  And this all the more now that our delegate has taken    his place there,  to our great satisfaction and with promise of good no less    great, of that spiritual good which is, indeed,  the most  solid basis of all    individual and social prosperity.
         &quot;We desire also to have now from his Excellency Mr. Chamberlain and     from Lord Halifax news of  their Majesties the King and the Queen  of     England and of their august family, and we hope that it will be very good.         &quot; We have no need to add, then, that we thank God for having spared     us the horrible war.  His Excellency Mr. Chamberlain knows that we have     desired this success, with the peaceful satisfaction of the just desires of the     known minorities, and we have invoked this success with the meditated offer     of our old life for the safety and tranquillity of the peoples.         &quot;It  is quite  clear and well understood  that we  are indeed  grateful  to     the  one who,  with a  courage  equalled by his self-denial, has  exerted his     personal efforts to secure such  an important success.         &quot; But, with the sincerity  which we owe  to our apostolic responsibilities     and to our age, we must  also  add that we have wished that from this most     happy success advantage might be drawn not alone  for the great peace  of     Europe and of the world, but also for internal peace, the peace  of the souls     and of the consciences of the many million Catholics in Germany,  whose most     grievous tribulations we follow and we  share each day;  who, in obedience     to their venerable cardinals and bishops and to  their priests, do not engage     in politics,  but seek the  sanctification and the salvation  of their souls  in     accordance with the doctrine and the law of  Jesus Christ, and who, by  that     very fact, make the most solid contribution to the welfare of their fatherland.     And this is, indeed, what must be said of the good Catholics of every country.     including, even in the first line, this Italy of which you  are such welcome     guests; we think  it well  that you should know this  from  a source which is     as sure as it is responsible.  Notwithstanding this,  every day and from  so     many  quarters, there are those who, through  calumny pure  and simple,     assert and would have the world believe the contrary.         &quot; We cannot permit a visit so highly appreciated to come to an end     without thanking his  Excellency Mr. Chamberlain  and  Lord Halifax for     their most noble courtesy, nor without giving them charge,  as we do, to carry     to their august Sovereigns and to all England our reiterated good wishes for     tranquillity, to-day so rare and  precious, and for full prosperity, not  only     in the New Year but for all  the future which it heralds.&quot;     It was evident  that His  Holiness was speaking with deep  emotion on thesubject of the  Catholics in  Germany.  In reply, the Prime Minister said that he,and indeed  all  England,  deplored the  sufferings  inflicted upon  Catholics,Protestants and Jews  in Germany; he and His Majesty&apos;s Government  would  benaturally most ready to intervene or intercede, either in Berlin or in Rome, in anyway possible that offered a hope  of improving  the situation; but, for  the moment,he saw no such hope, indeed, more evil than good might be done in present circum-stances by an  untimely and impolitic intervention; His Holiness  could, however,rest assured that he had the matter in mind  and, should an opportunity occur,would  do his  best.   Thereafter, Lord Halifax reiterated the  Prime Ministersexpressions of gratification at His Holiness&apos;s  reception and added that his visit to  the  Vatican  impressed him the  more  deeply  in  that  it  was 43 years since he had accompanied his father to an audience with Pope Leo XIII.   Finally,the Pope asked Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Halifax to accept, as a  memento  oftheir visit, a gold medallion representing the recently canonised English martyrsand saints, Thomas More and John Fisher; this was,  he pointed out,  apart fromother interest, a very respectable work of art; the representation of himself on the reverse would, however, he  added, appear to those who saw him to-day altogethertoo  flattering.   Due  thanks were  returned  for  this  gift, together with finalassurances of goodwill.     The four other members of the party were then introduced and the Pope roseand shook hands with them.   Monsignor Godfrey accompanied them and the Poperecommended  him  to  the  Prime  Minister as his Apostolic  Delegate-elect  toEngland.  His Holiness then walked briskly across to a shelf where  was a silverand enamel diptych, presented to him by the English College in Rome, representingSaints Thomas More and John Fisher.  &quot; You may tell their Majesties, you maysay it to  all England,&quot; he said, &quot; that England is always with me.&quot;     Leave was then taken of His Holiness.  The procession was re-formed and thechamberlains and officials in attendance were presented to the British Ministers.At the threshold of the Papal Apartment, Monsignor Mella took  his leave of the
                                    lb-party,  which was then  formally conducted, down the Grand Stairway, to theApartments of the Cardinal Secretary of State for the formal visit that usuallyfollows the audience with the Pope.  Here the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState and Mr. Osborne were invited into the cardinal&apos;s study and a short conver-sation  took place,  after which the party were presented to  Cardinal Pacelli.Leave was then taken of the Vatican officials and the return journey was made, inthe same Vatican cars and in the same order, to the British Legation.    The immediately subsequent luncheon was attended by Cardinal Pacelli, whothus fulfilled the formality of the return visit, Cardinal Pizzardo, who had beenthe Pope&apos;s Legate to  the Coronation, Monsignor Mella, the head  of  the PapalHousehold, Marquess Serafini, the Governor of Vatican City, Monsignori Tardiniand Montini, the TJnder-Secretary  of State and Assistant Under-Secretary ofState of the Secretariat of State, Prince Colonna, the head of the great PapalRoman family, the Rectors of the British,  Beda, Scots and Canadian Colleges in rome and Monsignor Heard, a Scottish judge in the Rota, the supreme ecclesiastical-tical court.    Rome, January 13, 1939.                                  No.  8. Record of the Prime Minister&apos;s Conversation with Signor Mussolini after the                Dinner at the British Embassy on January 13.    IN the course of a short conversation with Signor Mussolini after dinner atthe British Embassy on the evening of Friday, the 13th January, I said there wasone point upon which I was still rather unhappy in spite of the assurances whichthe Duce had given me, and that was upon Herr Hitler&apos;s  intentions.  I did not feel that what he had said as to the defensive  nature  of his rearmament wasaltogether convincing, and moreover we had since had further information which indicated the calling-up of reservists in the neighbourhood of Munich.  The Duceasked whether that was to-day  and I said yesterday.  He said that  this was contrary to his information, which  was that the reservists who had been called up in Austria had since been dismissed.   I then said that the German press hadon more  than one  occasion  been  somewhat contemptuous about the  fightingqualities  of democracies, indicating  that  in  no circumstances  would  they  beprepared to come to the test of war.  Such an  attitude betrayed a grave mis-apprehension; democracies would fight under certain circumstances and had beenready to fight last September, and  it would be a terrible  tragedy if aggressive action were taken under a misapprehension as to what  lengths the democraciesmight be prepared to go to.  The Duce made no direct reply to this remark, but said that the polemics of the German press were only an answer to the polemics ofthe press in other countries.  I said that I was aware that there  were  faults on both sides,  but that, after all, our press was free whereas  the press in  germany was controlled.  The Duce said he did not consider  that the press was  free any-where, since even in England it was  under the control of  the proprietors.    The conversation then became more  general, but Signor Mussolini impressed upon me that there was a good deal of misapprehension as to the control exercised over  the Italian press.  It was often  supposed that no matter appeared in thatpress  without having  first been approved by the Government authorities.  Thiswas not the case; it would take too much time to read  all the matter  that wasprinted, but if the  Government  were not satisfied with what had been printedthey could always confiscate the press, and this had happened even in the case ofhis own paper.                                  No.  9.     Joint Communique on the Visit issued at Midnight on January 13.    IN the conversations  which have taken place  during the last few daysbetween the Duce and the British Prime Minister, in which also the Ministers forForeign Affairs of the two countries, Count Ciano  and Lord Halifax, took part.the major questions  of the moment and  the relations between the two Empires
were  examined.  These conversations  have been characterised by  the  greatestcordiality, and have led to a frank and  wide exchange of views.  Both  sidesreaffirmed their intention to develop the relations between the two countries inthe spirit of friendship which animates the Agreement of the 16th April.  It wasalso decided  to proceed at the  earliest moment to the conclusion of the specialconventions as set forth in that instrument.    During the conversations there emerged once more the firm determination ofItaly  and Great Britain to pursue a policy which aims effectively at the main-tenance of peace a policy towards which the efforts of the two Governments havebeen,  and continue to be, directed.

NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN,  January 14, 1939.                                   No. 11.Telegram sent from Domodossola  to Count Ciano by the Secretary  of State on                  leaving Italy on the night of January 14.    BEFORE leaving Italy after a journey that your  kindness has made mostcomfortable I wish to thank your Excellency again for the magnificent hospitalitywhich we have enjoyed throughout our visit.
