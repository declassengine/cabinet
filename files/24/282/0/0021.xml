Summary of Reports submitted by the members of the Board of    Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with          statistical information from other sources).     OVERSEAS TRADE.  Imports in December ( 74.1 millions)showed a decline of  20.1 millions as compared with December1937.  Imports of raw materials and articles mainlyun-raunufactured were  7.5 millions less and imports of food,drink ana tobacco  7.3 millions less.   Exports of UnitedKingdom products ( 59.1. millions) were  4.8 millions less thanin December 1938.     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.   In the five weeks ended the 1st January,1939, railway traffic receipts decreased by  1,174,000 or7.46 per cent, compared with the corresponding period in 1937.The total receipts for the 52 weeks ended the 1st January 1939decreased by  7,056,000 or 4.29 per cent, compared with thecorresponding period of 1937.     EMPLOYMEITT.  Employment and unemployment showed little change between 14th November and the 12th December.  It isprovisionally estimated that at December 12&quot;Ch the number ofinsured persons aged 16 to 64 in employment. in Great Britain(inclusive of persons insured under the Agricultural Schemeand in the classes of domestic employment which became insurableon the 4th April 1938)  was 12,2o3,000.   This  figure was 5,000mo:re than the figure of employment on the 14-th November, 1938,and approximately 10,000 more  than the figure of employment on the 13th December 1^37, when,  however, outdoor employmentwas adversely affected by baci weather.                             -1-
     SKIPPING .   The Chamber of Shipping Index number ofshipping freights was 124.1 in December, as compared with 122.3in November,  and 141 in December,  1937.  During recent weeksthere has been a larger time-charter demand,  especially fromthe United States, but the general outlook is not bright.     SHIPBUILDING.  The outlook on the Clyde for 1939 is notvery promising;  very few of the yaras are now as busy as theywere twelve months ago.  The position on the Tyne has been improved by the booking of a contract for eleven ships for theTurkish Government.  Twenty-five out of thirty-three buildingberths on the Wear are empty.     Tonnage&quot;under construction in Great Britain and Irelandamounted to 779,762 gross tons at the end of 193d, us comparedwith 385,431 gross tons at the end of September, 1933, and1,125,426 gross tons at the ena of 1937.     ENGINEERING.   There was some falling off in demand over thepast year;  the recession would nave been considerably greaterhut for rearmament work.  Exports of machinery have continued tobe satisfactory, but care must be taken that an increase in work on rearmament aoes not lead ultimately to a decline in theexport trade.   During December new orders for work other thanrearmament have been slow in materialising.     BANKING.  Provincial clearings in December showed a decline of 9.7 per cent, as compared with December, 1937.  This uecreaseis substantially less than the average decrease both for thewhole year 1953 and the last quarter thereof, which were 14.5per cent, and 12.4 per cent-, respectively.     Bill rates rose from ^ per cent, at the beginning ofDecember to about 1-g per cent, in Christmas week.     MOTOR INDUSTRY,  hew registrations of mechanically propelled vehicles in November were 53,335,  an increase of 3,743 as comparedwith November 1937.  The percentage increase was 12.2 in the caseof mechanically propelled vehicles, other than motor-cycles and15 in the case of motor-cycles.                               -2-
     COTTON.  In the early part of December activity increased alittle, but at the end of the month business was very slack.The  index of production per working day declined from 95 inNovember to 90 in December (1935 s 100).   Production inDecember was about 64^ of full capacity, compared with 72^ inthe  preceding month, and 8CK6 in December, 1937.     WOOL.  There was a very slight improvement in the wooltextile industry during December as compared with November.Employment among operatives was steady and showed an appreciableimprovement over December 1937.   Wool prices, however, tended to decline.     The number of persons insured against unemployment aged16-64 in the woollen and worsted industries declined from223,860 in July 1937 to 215,770 in July, 1938.   There was alsoa reduction in the number of juveniles employed in the industries.The number of unemployed in the woollen and worsted industry inthe West Riding is over 23,000.     HOSIERY.   In most branches trade showed signs ofimprovement.   A joint conference of United Kingdom builders offine gauge full-fashioned hosiery machinery and fine gauge full-fashioned hosiery manufacturers has, under the auspices of theImport Duties Advisory Committee, discussed the restrictions onthe export of hosiery machinery from Germany.    The hosierymanufacturers and the machinery manufacturers agreed to considerthe possibility of building as satisfactory a machine in thiscountry as is at present produced in Germany.     COAL.   There has been practically no change in the positionof the coal industry in respect of either export or inland trade.The seasonal demand for house coal has been active but theincreased demand for industrial coals which took place duringthe latter part of October has not been maintained.    Theexport trade continues to be depressed.    For the four weeks                                 -3-
ended. December 17th, there has been a decrease in output of 6.39%as compared with the corresponding period of 1937;   for the50 weeks ended December 17th the decrease was 5:12%.     CHEMICALS.   Trade in December was less satisfactory than inNovember.   There was a further reduction of deliveries ofalkalies, acids and chlorine, both in the export and the home market;  sales of sulphuric acid have declined heavily, and thedemand for chemicals for the rayon and rubber industries remaineddepressed.   The improvement in November in the demand fordyestuffs was not maintained in December.     CO-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.  Sales of furniture in thelast quarter of 1938 were satisfactory and up to the average forthe period of the year;  it was a record year for sales of toys.Demand for drapery, which had been adversely affected by theinternational situation, was good in December.   Activity in the productive factories allied to the drapery warehouses shows anincrease.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.   Bales of wool received into store duringthe five months ended the 30th November, 1933, amounted to2,136,000 bales, of which 1,029,000 bales were disposed of by sale or shipment;   the figures for the corresponding period of 1937 were,318,000 bales and 953,000 bales respectively.   Exports of wheat in the period December 1st to 26th declined as compared with thecorresponding period of the previous year, but there was an increasein exports of butter during the second half of 1938 as comparedwith the second half of 1937.     CANADIAN TRADE.  Economic conditions in Canada improved inthe closing months of 1938.   There are signs that conditionswill improve further, though the international political situation                                       \is an unsettling influence.     The index of the physical volume of business for november was 123.4, compared with 118.6 in October.   The volume of business
turnover in the whole year 1938, was only surpassed inperiods of unusual prosperity such as 1929 and 1937.     COL ON LaL TRADE.,   There has been a marked improvement inthe price of sugar which makes a difference of over  1,000,000in the gross annual income of the Colonial Empire;  -the pricesof cocoa and cotton remained at unsatisfactory low levels.There is some indication that the excess stocks of imported goods in l/est Africa, which proved a serious drag on importtrade in 1938 have largely been liquidated.
