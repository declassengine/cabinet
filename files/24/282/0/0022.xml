(THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S C-OVIRNISHT)CP.  22 (59)o                                  COPY NO.                       C A 3 I IT E To                  CAMPS POR WAR AUD PEACE                         PURPOSESo               Memorandum by the Lord  Privy Seal0            At the instance of the ^resident of the  Board  of Education       a Conference of representatives of the following Departments -       Lord Privy Seal; Ministries of  Health and Labour, Board  of       Education, Department of Health for Scotland,  Scottish Education       Department, and Office of Works - was called  on the 13th       instant to consider the question of the Government  constructing       or assisting the construction of camps to  serve the triple       purpose of school camps and camps for adult holiday-makers       in time of peace and camps for  refugees in time of  war.   The       Conference has now reported and its conclusions are summarised       as follows:-            &quot;(l) Camps would serve a valuable purpose for  each  of  the       three objects - schools, holiday-makers, refugees  (paraso 4,  5       and 6).             (2) Even if all the camp   accommodation theoretically       desirable for school camps were provided (158,000 places),       and a similar amount for holiday-makers, it would make only a       small addition to the accommodation likely to be required for       war purposes.   Camps cannot be an alternative to billeting,       but v/ould be a valuable supplement by way of  shelter for       &quot;non-effectives&quot; of all kinds,  and for conversion  into       auxiliary hospitals (para. 6).
     (3) The dual use of a camp for children and adultholiday-makers is possible, but a dual use would be undulyexpensive and would not be likely to prove attractive to thelatter0     (4) Apart from the time-factor the finding of sites shouldnot prove a serious difficulty (para. 11).     (5) The capital cost of a camp for children is about 50 a head.   The annual cost of such a camp (excluding food and attendance) is estimated at about 4s88d!, a week per child,if the camp is fully occupied for five months of the year(para.  12).     (6) The corresponding figure for a camp for adultholiday-makers is about 7s. 8dn, if the camp is fully occupiedfor four months in the year &quot;(para. 14).     (7) The cost of food and attendance is estimated at about llSoOd. a week in the case of a school child and about17s.Ode in the case of an adult.     (8) We think that, If camps were provided and accommodation were offered to Education. Authorities on the half-and-half basis suggested in paragraph 16, the offer would prove acceptable.     (9) Similarly, having regard to the comparatively lowcharge which the half-and-half basis would permit for holiday-makers, we think that there would be no difficulty in fillinga moderate number of camps.    (10) If a substantial programme of camps is decided on, the work should be done centrally, and preferably by anon-profitmaking Association operating with grants and loans from the Exchequer.   But if a considerable instalment ofcamps is required by the 1st August, the time-factor w*ouldmake it necessary for the Government to carry out the programmethrough the Office of Works.   On the ground of expense aiadfor other reasons a longer period for completion is ver3rdes ir ab 1 e (para 22) .11
     A cop;/ of the Report is atbached.     I ask for Cabinet authority to proceed, oa the basisof immediate war urgency, with a scheme on the following lines :-     la   The time-table to be aimed at should be 100 camps(holding roughly 35,000 persons) in each of the next twoyears, the first -50 to be completed by August of this yearand the next 50 by Larch, 1940o     2o   A non-profit-making Association should be set upimmediatels^ and the necessary legislation., as described inthe Report, inserted in the Air Raid Precautions Bill or ina separate Billo     3o   &apos;7hile the association is being formed the Depart-rnents, with the help of the Inland Revenue Valuation Depart-rrient, should take immediate steps to find sites and, inparticular, country mansions, and the Office of Works should arrange for the construction to be commenced as soon as poss-ession of the sites can be obtainedo   For the first 50, the shorter of the two time-tables mentioned in the report should be adopted notwithstanding its disadvantages;,     4.   The camps should be handed over as soon as possibleto the Association, who should be instructed to make themavailable for the use of school children or holiday-makersand to make the best bargains  they can with EducationAuthorities and holiday organisations, including largeemployers.   The half-and-half basis suggested in theReport, i.e., that the Association should, if possible,recover from the peace-time users of the camps not less thanone-half of the coot of construction and maintenance, shouldbe aimed ato
                                                                    loo  *                                                          f               5.   The cost,  approximately  2 million for 100  camps,          should &quot;be met partly by direct grant and  -partly by loan  to          the Association on which interest would be  payable, the          proportions contemplated being, as already  stated, half  and          half.   This figure does not take account of the additional          requirements and equipment necessary for  the conversion  of          the camps into hospitals.             6.   Six of the first instalment of fifty experimental          camps proposed in paragraph 1 might be provided in Scotland,          In view of the different conditions in Scotland - in          particular the shortage of accommodation  for evacuated          persons, which is referred to in the Report oi  the Committee          on Evacuation - the question whether a larger proportion of          any subsequent instalments should be allocated to Scotland          will require further consideration.             70   There is already in existence in  Scotland a          Housing Association which has experience  of timber construc-                                                      -          tion in the Special Areas.   This Association is in process  of          being re-constituted to enable it to build  outside, as well          as inside, the Special Areas.   The duties  which it is pro-          posed to confer in England on the non-profit-making Associations          referred, to in paragraph 2 could be carried out in Scotland          by the re-constituted Housing Association.                              -             8.   There has not been time to discuss  these orooosals          with the Treasury, and I underotand that  the position          of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is reserved.   -                                    (Intd.) .

                        REPORT ON GAMPS-.                          Introduction.     1.   On 10th January the President of the Board ofEducation wrote to the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary ofState for Scotland, and the Ministers of Health and Labour,suggesting that the question of constructing camps to serve the triple purpose of school camps and camps for adultholiday-makers In time of peace and camps for refugees Intime of war called for immediate consideration.   The ministers concerned concurred in this view and the representatives ofthe various Departments named in the first appendix to thisReport were instructed on the 13th January to consult, and tofurnish the Ministers with a report on the matter at theearliest possible date.          We have consulted confidentially a number ofpersons, including Sir Ronald Davison and his architectMr. Langley Taylor and representatives of the National Councilof Social Service who have had practical experience in thismatter.   We have naturally taken into account the various suggestions, beginning with Sir R. DavisonTs article In the!Times 1 of 16th December, 1938, which have appeared in that paper and elsewhere, but we have understood that it was not within our province to consider the suggestion that theconstructional work should be done by unemployed labourorganised in a &quot;labour corps.&quot;          Our Report had to be prepared at great speed andnecessarily suffers from this, more particularly In regard tothe estimates of cost of the various items of capital andmaintenance expenditure.   We have had before us a number ofrough figures and estimates of cost supplied by theCommissioner for the Special Areas, the National Council of social Service, and other bodies, but time has not permittedof a detailed analysis of these.
     2*   Powers under,.the Education ,,,and Physical Training Acts...          In England and Wales Elementary Education Authoritiesare empowered to provide and maintain or aid holiday or schoolcamps for children attending elementary schools.    higher education Authorities have similar powers in respect of other children and persons of any age.          Elementary Education Authorities may receive a20$ grant on expenditure incurred on the maintenance of camps and a 50$ grant, up to 31st December,  1943, on expenditureon their provision.   Higher Education Authorities may receive a 50^ grant in respect of either provision information in t en an ce of c amp s.          In Scotland, Education Authorities may provide orassist holiday or school camps for persons resident in their area, and may receive a 50% grant in respect of approvedexpenditure on the provision or maintenance of camps, either for school children or for persons in their area who are notattending Day Schools.          Under the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937,a local authority may provide and equip holiday camps andcamping sites, and may manage the camps themselves or let themto any organisation at a nominal or other rent.   The Boardof Education, or the Secretary of State for Scotland, may makecapital grants to local authorities for the provision of campsor camping sites, but no grants may be made under this Act tolocal authorities for the maintenance of. camps.   The Board andthe Secretary of State may also give grants towards theprovision of camps by local voluntary organisations.                    Existing Camp Provisions.     3.    (a) England and Wales.   At present there are inexistence 20 permanent camps for school children in Englandand Wales, provided and conducted by Education Authorities.
 They are  on  a  very small  scale  ranging from 20 to 150 places, and trie  estimated aggregate  accommodation provided amounts to roughly  only 1,400,           A  further  group of 16 permanent school camps has been provided  by  the National  Council of Social Service, from grants made by  the  Commissioner  for the Special Areas.   These are in the main  larger camps  of  about  300 places each, and at present provide  total  accommodation  of  4,200 places.   Only 25 per cent. of  this  accommodation, however,  is situated in reception areas. Apart from teachers&apos; salaries the entire cost of these camps, including capital,   maintenance  and travelling expenses is met by  a grant provided  for that  purpose by the Commissioner.  Some of  these  camps are used during  the summer holidays by organisations  providing holidays for the unemployed.           Apart from the  camps  mentioned above, there are a number of holiday camps run  on  a commercial basis.   While these vary greatly in size,  their  total capacity may be about 50,000, but  we have not been able  to obtain accurate information on this point.    Of  this probably  under  50 per cent, is in reception areas.   Many of these private venture camps are planned on a fairly lavish  scale, and  during  193S their scale of charges ranged from 45/- to  about  60/-  a head per week.      (D)   Scotland.          As powers  to provide  school camps were only given to the  Education Authorities  in 1936, and grant for their provision and  maintenance was made available only in 193S, no permanent school camps have yet been provided in Scotland, but severalEducation Authorities have the matter under consideration.      (c)  So far no permanent camps or sites for such camps havebeen provided by local authorities or voluntary organisations either in England and Wales or in Scotland under the physical training and Recreation Act,  but several projects are at present under consideration.
                                                             4 f&quot;?  &apos;                                                           1 I M                    User of camps in peace-time.     4.   We turn now to the question of the peace-time userof these Gamps (a) as School Camps, and (b) as Holiday Camps.For the reasons which appear later we do not thinic that ingeneral these two forms of user can satisfactorily he combinedin any single schemee          School Camps are normally used by Education authorities for sending elementary school children to the country duringterm time for periods usuall;/ of a fortnight and occasionallyof a weeit in order that they may get the physical and moral&quot;benefit of a change from an urban to a rural environment.The children go in their normal school classes with theirteachers, and the period at the Camp is reckoned for purposesof grant as attendance at their ordinary school.  They do a normal day&apos;s school work but of course have the advantage of thehealthy surroundings and of camp life.  Hitherto the childrenhave been children over 11 years of a^e, but the practice isnow being extended to junior children under 11 years of age.  Atthe present time the practice of sending school children to campsis not extensive.  in 1937 only 75 Education Authorities hadarrangements for this purpose.  These arrangements involvedexpenditure of  53,000.  in the event of new School camps being constructed out of central funds, Education Authorities wouldprobably be much more ready to send their school children to themin this way, and to pay some rent for the user of the -camps.While,  however, this user would show a credit on what may becalled the &apos;Camp Account&apos;, the whole of that credit would notenure to the Exchequer since, even at the present rate of grant,20 per cent, of the Authority&apos;s net expenditure would be met from central funds.          Normally, school camps are used only during the summer months and only in the manner described above during
                                                          X1 &amp; term-time.   During  the holidays, however, groups of children are  sent  in  the  charge of  their  teachers  in the same way, though they do not  receive  formal instruction. .  Broadly speaking, therefore, we  should anticipate  that, assuming that the camps were offered to  Education  Authorities on  acceptable terms, they would be  used  to capacity  for at least five months in every year and, if they were favourably situated and were heated, for an even longer  period.          The number of children over 11  in urban areas in England and  Wales is  708,000 boys and 709,000 girls, i.e. , 1,400,000 altogether.   The corresponding total for Scotland is about 180,000.    If  it is  assumed that each camp would take ten relays of children throughout the year, the amount of accommodation required for England and Y/ales would be about 140,000 beds,or,  say, 400  camps, and in Scotland 18,000 beds, or,  say,  50  camps.    The occupation of school camps on this scale is  clearlj&quot; not  practicable in the near future.      5.   AdUlt  Holiday Camps raise a different problem and one  on which there is much less material  to arrive at an estimate  of  potential user.   The extension of the principle of holidays  with pay has brought within the  reach of a much larger section of industrial workers the  possibility ofbeing able to take a week&apos;s holiday away  from their ownhomes.    It  is estimated that in the summer of 1938 the total number of  employed, persons covered by arrangements providing for holidays with pay was some 8,000,000 and it is fairly certain that this number will increase in the next few  years.   There is, however, no settled tradition in the matter, and  it is probable that in the first instance it&quot;would be  the yoimgev  sections of the community, whose habits are  less  fixed, who might be considered as potential users.
of the camps.    As the better paid workers  have  respondedin considerable numbers to the holiday camps which havebeen run as commercial ventures,  we should  from  that experience, expect that the mere existence of camps providedby the State would tend to stimulate their  use,  providedthat the charge for each individual - which should be absoulutely inclusive - were kept down to a  strictly moderatefigure with special arrangements for transport.    Further,we consider that if the process of staggering of holidays  isextended, it should be possible to secure a two-thirds userof the camp&apos;s capacity for, say, the six months  from April  tothe end of September;  in other words, the  camp would be usedto eapacity for four months in the year.   Such a development would be greatly assisted if it were possible to arrangealso for such large industrial concerns as  the RailwayCompanies and other&apos;public utility bodies,  which havenecessarily to spread their employees&apos; holidays over a largeperiod of the year, to rent the camps for a period  coveringless popular seasons.                        User in. war-time.     6.   If camps  are placed  in relatively safe areas, areheated and are capable of extension,  they would obviously hevaluable in war-time.   They would,  at  the lowest,  be areserve of safe accommodation  available  for  some  of thepopulation who may  be forced from  their  homes by bombing.It seems to us that,In view of the  enormous  scale  of damagelikely to  occur  during the first  year  of war (the  Report ofthe Emergency Reconstruction Committee  suggests that half amillion houses may  be totally  destroyed and from  one to twomillion houses damaged), the greater  the  number  of  safe campsthere are  in existence, the better.   They would  also be
                                                             1M f                                                               I 3 available for more  specific purposes,  e.g. ,  auxiliary hospitals. In particular, a camp placed round  a large mansion house might with comparatively  little  extension and  alteration make quite a satisfactory hospital  for certain types  of cases.           \&apos;Ie  understand  that on  the present  estimates of the Ministry of Health  something like 70,000 additional hospital beds may he required, apart from extensions  of existing hospitals.    The provision of  some  proportion of this accommodation in a  form  in which it would have a valuable peace-time  use has  obvious advantages, amongst which may be mentioned the consideration that it would avoid  public disclosure  of the amount of hospital accommodation thought necessary to  deal with casualties.           It  is  clear; however,  from the correspondence in the  Press  that many people are viewing the provision of camps as a substitute  for,  or a  supplementation of, billeting.   It is true  that  school camps  could  accommodate  children in war-time  and  - with some structural additions in some cases - other non-effective members  of the  population who might otherwise have t o be  billeted.   To that extent  the billeting problem would  be eased, but no provision of  camps on any imaginable  scale would alter the fact that the great majority of persons  to  be evacuated must be  accommodated by beingbilleted  in existing houses, though the  camps might be useful in assisting the provision  of communal meals where cooking facilities  in billets were  inadequate.    Thus, for example, if   camps sufficient  to afford a week&apos;s holiday for 2,000,000workers were erected, the  total accommodation on the basis that  they would be used for five months would only be about100,000.   A.R.P. requirements for such camps could be met at small expense by the provision of permanent trenches.
                     Location of Camps7,   School campSo  The only necessary conditions for theseare that the camp should he in quiet and reasonably attractivecountry? sufficiently near to a town or substantial village toavoid catering difficulties and to the home town of thechildren to avoid heavy travel ling expenses,    A site on thecoast is obviously more attractive? but is in no way necessary9and the cost of the land may be as much as five times as great.     Adult Holiday Camps.   A site which will attract holiday-makers is more difficult to find.    Here again? the question of travelling expenses is an important one5 though probably a gooddeal could be done in the way of cheap travelling facilities ifthe arrangements could be so organised that the campers travelboth ways &quot;against the traffic&quot;.   To what extent the wage-earners would be attracted by a camp which is not on or withineasy reach of the sea and of the amusements to be found inseaside towns must remain largely a matter of opinion untilpractical experience is gained.    Failing a seaside location?sites near rivers and lakes are likely to prove more attractivethan elsewhere.     Refugee Camps,   The requirements of a camp site intended for refugees in war are more stringent.   The areas classifiedfor evacuation as vulnerable or neutral should be barred? andwe think that public opinion would not approve the siting ofcamps on or near the East Coast,   Assuming that the campswould be used for &quot;non-effectives&quot; of all kinds? the western counties would be the better from the point of view both of security and of supply.   Obviously also proximity to towns?military and naval establishments? aerodromes? munition works?power stations and main line railways must be avoided? andin general woody country preferred to open.,
      8. Yfe have had the advantage of discussing this  matter with the Chief Valuer of the Inland Revenue Department,  withMr. Taylor a member of the Forestry Commission and with arepresentative of the Duchy of Lancaster.   Our general con-elusion is that, if it were decided to embark on a programmeof 50 or even 100 camps (with an average size of about 15 acres),there would be no great difficulty in finding the necessarysites to answer these various requirements, and that,  if desired,a considerable number could be found on or -within easy reach of.the sea on the West Coast of England and Wales or Scotland.  Inorder to save both expense and time in negotiation, powers of compulsory purchase would be essential.          The Forestry Commission could almost certainly findone site in Scotland (on the shores of Loch Awe) and probablyone or two in the Forest of Dean, and one at Buriton in Hampshire.They reminded us that the danger of fire is a serious consideration, and also that the difficulty of finding on their land a tolerably level and otherwise suitable site of thenecessary size in Western England and Scotland and In Wales isconsiderable.          As regards the Duchy of Lancaster land, it seems possible that their estates at Reedwood (Staffs), Myerscough(Lanes), Wierside  (Lanes), Whitewell (Lanes), might be able toprovide sites.  The land, however, is under full cultivation,and for the purpose of acquiring this land the usual steps would be necessary.  In a letter addressed to the Minister  ofHealth&apos;.by Sir Ralph Glyn, Member of Parliament for Abingdon anda member of the Thames Conservancy, he  suggests that a number of sites could be found in the Upper Thames Valley, and that,assuming proper drainage arrangements,  the Conservators would raise no difficulties.  For the purposes of London, sites  could not doubt be found  at the foot of the South Downs, includingthe Hampshire and Berkshire Downs, and  in the Chilterns.
                           School Camps.     9.   Size of Camps.  It appears to he generally agreed that themost convenient camp for school purposes is one which will accommodateabout 350 children and teachers.  Such a camp, when provision is madefor sleeping quarters, kitchen and dining halls, baths and lavatories,class, recreation arid isolation huts, administration offices, stores,etc., and playing fields, might reasonably occupy about 10 acres.  Ifsuch a camp were to be constructed with a view to use and possibleextension in -war-time, it would be necessary to provide from thecommencement for heating and for adequate water, drainage and cookingfacilities for the larger number and to purchase sufficient additional land - say up to 15 acres in all.  By.arrangements such as these itwould be possible in an emergency to provide practically double thepeace-time accommodation.     10.  Method of construction and layout.  Any buildings erectedwould be of the single storey or hut type, and might be constructedof any of the materials commonly in use for such buildings.  Thenormal method would be to use a timber-framed building on a brick orconcrete&apos;foundation lined on the outside with weather boarding, and months&amp; inside with asbestos sheets.  By the employment of a unit systemof design based on this form of construction we consider that theessential requirements in respect of speed in execution and of initialand maintenance costs would be mot in as practical a manner as possible          The layout of the camp would largely depend on the physicalcharacteristics of the site.  If peace-time occupation were alone tobe considered there would be a grouping of the various types ofbuilding in such a way as to make for the utmost convenience ofadministration and economy in the provision of roads, paths, drainsand water and electrical supply.  This, however, would tend to resultin a formal layout which would - especially from the air - have much the same appearance as an army hutted camp.  This will have to beborne in mind when preparing the site plan.  With skilful planning, alay-out which would not provide an obvious target would cost very
 little more than, would one  of  regular  form.   This  consideration would he even more  important  if  camps  were extended very considerably or if  several  camps were  sited  in proximity to each other.  From the  point  of view  of economy in administration and  also  of  the provision  of  amusements and amenities there is  much  to  be  said for a  group system.      11.   Cost of site and  buildings.  The cost of  a site of 15 acres  largely turns on its  situation and  the availability of services.   A purely rural site might cost from  30^to  40 an acre;   one  on the sea  and near an urban centre from  200 an acre  upwards.   One  possibility we have  considered  is the acquisition of large country houses  of  30 or 40 rooms with thei: surrounding park land .   Such a house would form a valuable nucleus to  a  camp by providing accommodation for camp staff, administration and  common rooms  etc.   In  some of the camps already provided  by the  Special  Areas  Commissioner use ismade  of old  buildings  in this  manner.    The Chief Valuerwhom wo have  consulted thought that there would be no difficulty  in  finding  such houses and  estates, but saidthat normally  a much larger area than 15 acres would haveto be acquired -  probably 200  acres or more.  Any land notrequired for camps could be sold off or leased.  The cost of such an estate would not much exceed  70  an acre in afavourable case,  including the house.     12.  In view of differences in the values of sites andin the work in preparation,  drainage, etc.,  the following figures of cost cannot be regarded as firm estimates,  but are

Food and attendance.   In the case of a schoolcamp, the disciplinary side of the management is carriedout by the teachers who accompany the children, while the catering, cleansing, etc., are under the control of apermanent camp staff.   In the case of the school campsgiven as the costs of a typical  camp for 350  schoolchildren on a site costing  40 per acre,  erected  at  atime when the conditions in the  building industryapproximate to those of the present time.
in the Specials Areas, we were informed by the national council of Social Service that each camp whichaccommoaates 336 children would &quot;be run by 1 Camp Manager,4 COOKS,  6 maids, 2 handymen and 1 iiurse, and thatthe total cost of food and attendance (cooking, lighting,water, etc.) for all the occupants of a camp, expressedin cost per child-head per ween; ranges for the campson the North East coast from about 9s.5d. to 11s.4d.,of which the cost of raw food accounts for from 5s.9d. to7s.4d. xn South  wales it i-s somewhat higher.  Food costsIs. more, and the inclusive costs are from 2s. to2s.6d. more.          Combining these figures with those forrunning costs it would appear that a school  camp could be run without loss (on  the basis  that it is efiectivelyfull  for five months) at a weekly inclusive  charge of14s.  to 16s. per child per week in a favourable  area and about  16s.  to 18s. in other areas.  lbs. per weeii  perchild may perhaps be  taken as the typical figure ofall-in cost for  a school camp.12 a.
                                                          10^                                                          i O M                       Holiday. Camps.     14.   Several factors combine to make holiday camps for families more  costly  than school camps,   The site would have to he  selected with a view to holiday amenities which would usually mean that it  would have to be near the sea and an urban  centre, with a  consequent high cost per acre.   There would  have to  be additional recreational facilities on the site - which might involve using a larger area - and the necessary&quot;accommodation must cost more as adults require more space  than children.   The cost of the buildings, if in the form of a separate chalet for each family, would also be enhanced.   Furniture and equipment would also be more costly. Rateable value and rates would be higher.       We have had the advantage of seeing the detailed figures of cost based  on tender prices of a holiday camp with chalet accommodation  just about to be erected by a Welfare Association.   &quot;We have practically all the details for this except the cost of the land, but if  200 per acre is allowed for this it appears that the cost per head comes out at just under  60.   We have  also seen the detailed estimates of a more elaborate commercial camp where the cost per head works out at  80.   Assuming a cost per head of  60, the running costs of a camp for 350 holiday-makers would, be in the neighbourhood of  2,100 to  2,300 a year apart from food and attendance.   The rateable value placed on the camp, and the poundage of local rates would make for considerable variations in this figure.   On  the basis of a 4 months-&apos; fulluser,  this is equivalent to a weekly charge of 7s.  to 7/8d.   The cost of raw food per adult would be about 12s.  per week;4&quot;  cooking, lighting,  attendance,  etc.  would account for another 5s.,  so that the total all-in. cost for an adult at such a camp might be about 24/6d.  per week.&quot;f The National Council of Social Service would put this  figure   at 9s.  - 10s.  in the North Eastern area.
           The  cost  for  a  child would  be  less, mainly  on account  of the cost of  food,  and might perhaps be  put at  about 19s.   If the  terms were  to  be a fixed price for adults,  and  half-price for children,  then on  the&apos; basis of an  average family of 2 adults  ana  I-g- children, the  fixed price for adults would,  have to  be &quot;about  28s.  per week. School camps converted  into  Holiday camps. 15.        School camps  are based on the  dormitory  system  which is not suitable  for holiday  camps  for families.  To convert such a camp into a  holiday camp it would be necessary to  provide  and store partitions which,  during the  holiday season, could be used  to divide the sleeping huts and  some of the class rooms into sleeping  accommodation  for families.   It would  also be necessary to provide and  store additional bedding, furniture and equipment.   It  is only possible to make rough  estimates of the cost  of these items.   The partitions might cost   2,000 and allowing  them  a  ten years&apos; life,  this would mean an annual charge of   240.  The cost of  the labour  and materials  for erecting  the partitions and later  taking them down might amount to  500,  while the cost of the extra furniture and the storingmight well  account for a further  500 per annum.   If  the camp accommodated 350 children before  conversion it would probably accommodate about 300 persons after conversion.   To accommodate these 300 persons it would be necessary  to spend, on the figures given about  1,240 per annum.  This sum would have to be recovered during the holiday season.    If that season is assumed&apos;to be 6 weeks long,  this would involve an additional charge of14s.  a week per person.   These figures make it quite clear thatit is not an economical  proposition to contemplate the dual userof a  camp for school and. holiday  purposes.
                     Finance.     &quot;US.  There are two ways Of looking at the questionof financing the camps.   If the view is taken,that theprovision of camps is an essential measure of passivedefence, the cost should presumably be &quot;borne by theExchequer.   In that case the fact that the camps mayserve a very valuable purpose in peace time is afortunate accident.   If it is possible to recover a portion of the expenditure from local educationauthorities or holiday makers so much the better, butin any event It would, be bad policy to allow the campsto remain empty in peace and, from the strictly financialpoint of view it would be worth while having themoccupied if rents or other payments could be obtainedwhich would do anything more than cover the additionalwear and tear.          If on the other hand the view is taken thatpurely as a defence measure the provision of these campsis not a matter of the first importance,  it may bethought that the double purpose which they could serve in peace and War justifies an undertaking which would notbe worth while under present conditions for either1purpose taken by itself.   On this view it might be reasonable for the Exchequer to finance the constructionof camps on the footing that roughly half theexpenditure should be treated as defence expenditure and paid to the body who construct the camps as a grant and that the remainder should be treated as a loan onwhich,  after an initial period, suitable loan charges would be paid.   On this basis it would be fair to haveregard to any additional cost which the intended userof the camp for defence purposes involves.   As regards
the camp itself,  this is chiefly a matter of (a)  provi&amp;ihheating apparatus for winter use, (b) disposing thebuildings so as not to present an obvious target, and(c) providing extra administrative and kitchenaccommodation to cope with a rapid expansion of the camp in emergencies.   The extra cost of these might at a very rough estimate be put at 10% of the whole.In addition, the necessity for avoiding the easternpart of the country will tmdoubtedly increase the costof travelling for London children and holiday makers.          On the other hand in so far as expense was incurred in amenities (e.g. bathing pools) this might reasonably be set off against expenditure for defence purposes.
 17.       We have already estimated that the capital and maintenance costs of a school camp would work out at about 4/3 per week per child and the cost of food and. attendance at between 9/6 to 13/6 varying with locality.   Thus,  on the half-and-half basis suggested the burden on the Education Author! ty per week per child would&quot; be 9/G to 13/6 (&quot;food and attendance)  plus 2/4 (half capital and maintenance costs),  making a total of 11/lO to 15/10.   To what extent Education Authorities would be ready to send their school children to camps on these terms if the camps were provided it is impossible to say with certainty without taking &quot;soundings&quot; which time has not permitted and in any event we  did not feel  authorised to  do,  but our opinion is  that in view of the small amount of accommodation which  could  be provided in thcearly years  compared with the number of eligible  children the camps if well constructed and  situated  would be  fully  used.           As  regards adult holiday-makers,  we have estimated the capital  and maintenance  costs  at about  7/6  per week per  person and the  cost of food  and attendance  at 17/-.  On the  half-and-half basis the  cost of the holiday-maker  would  be  17/&apos;- (food and attendance)plus 3/9  (half  capital and maintenance  costs),  making a  total of 20/9 a week.  If  children  were taken at half-price,  the  half-and-half basis would mean  that the weekly charge for  an adult would  beabout 24/2.   The charge  per  holiday-maker suggested  in Sir  R. Davison&apos;s  article is   3 a week for man and wife,  with a reduced  charge  for children.   The  exact charge would probably need to be  considered in relation to  the  travelling expenses,  but if,  aswe believe, a camp such  as we  contemplate would attract  holiday-makers at  an  average price of  about  25/- a  week,  the  half-arid-halfbasis would enable this price  to be  achieved.   A camp run on  this basis would provide facilities for members  of  an  economic  class  for whose requirements no provision  has  hitherto  been made.
                                                             4                                                             Xu *                          Oi-gani saticn.  18.        If  it  is  decided  to proceed with a substantial programme  of  camps,  the question arises whether the actual  task of acquiring  sites and  constructing camps should be done by local body.es or by  some central  organisation.   If by local bodies, the obvious bodies  for the purpose  are the local education authorities, but the -  activities of  these authorities could be supplemented by offering  inducements in the shape of grants to (a) charitable and other non-profit-making bodies,  (bj bodies which limit their profits  en  the lines prescribed&apos; for &quot;housing associations&quot;, and (c) commercial concerns carrying on the camping business,  or to any of these.    A system of this kind would  have some advantages,  but we do not recommend it.    So far as  local  education authorities are concerned, little  has  been done as  yet in the,way of providing camps, notwithstanding the Exchequer grants  available,  and we doubt whether anything short of a very high rate of grant  (say,  75 per cent,) would provide  a sufficient  stimulus.   Moreover,  in any case it  is unlikely that  any effective  start  would  be made  before the  autumn. A system of subsidising  commercial concerns  is open to many objections.    Many of  these  concerns  are, we  believe,  doing exceedingly well  under present conditions, and it wo uld  be  said  on the  one  hand that no subsidy is necessary, and on  the other that  if a subsidy is given the Government  must take sufficient  control to prevent profiteering.   To subsidise  charitable  or  semi-charitable bodies is open  to  less objection,  but, here again,  the necessary preliminaries  (e.g., investigating the financial stability  of the body) will make for delay.          The  slow pace at which applications for grant  under the physical Training  Act are maturing illustrates the  objection  to this system if speed is a primary  object.          Moreover, under any system which involves  the  provision of camps by a number of separate bodies,  there may well  be  a scramble for attractive sites and  a danger of
                                                               loo                                                               loodifferent bodies bidding against each other;  and unless the Governmentinsisted on a very high degree of control over plans, there wouldprobably be a good deal of waste.   Moreover, if any camps are intended for use as hospitals in wartime, the design would have to be very carefully thought out and this again would mean central control,,    19.   If a central organisation is adopted, it might take one of four forms:-     (a)  It would be possible to entrust the work to one of the          existing Departments.   This would be the quickest v^ay of          getting the work started, but none of the Departments          concerned, with the exception of the Office of Works, is.at          present equipped for this work, and the extreme pressure on          that office and indeed on Whitehall generally would present a          serious difficulty.   Moreover, the choice of sites for camps          and many of the detailed arrangements are likely to provoke          controversy, and it may be an advantage that the          responsibility of the Government should be at one remove.     (b)  Alternatively, a commission or body of commissioners might be          set up under the general control of a Minister.   This is the          system under the Special Areas Acts.   The commissioner^          office would presumably have to be staffed in the main, if          not wholly, by Civil Servants, and to that extent the scheme          is open to some of the objections in (a).   Moreover, the          experience of the Commissioner for the Special Areas does not          suggest that machinery of this kind makes&apos; for speed or          simplicity of administration.     (c)  The government might encourage the flotation of a company          with limited profits, inviting the public (including the big          industrial concerns) to subscribe and enabling (by          legislation) local authorities to do so.   A number of small          and local housing associations are conducted on this basis,
      but  so far as  we  know there   is      no precedent for a national  body of this  kind.     . The response of the public would be doubtful and at      the best local authorities would take months to      make up their minds to assist,( d)    The Government might set up a non-profit-making      body (probably in the shape  of a company limited      by guarantee)  on the same lines as the North Eastern      Housing Association, the recently formed Scottish      Housing Association and the  Trading Associations in      the Special Areas, and provide that this body should      be assisted, by Exchequer money in the shape of      grants and loans.  A body of this kind would      presumably have a directorate and staff recruited      mainly, if not entirely, from outside Whitehall.      The constitution of the body under the Companies Act      could be effected simply and quickly, and the only      legislation required would be to authorise the      necessary financial assistance,  to provide machinery      for the compulsory purchase  of land, and probably      to expedite procedure under  the Town and Country      Planning Act and in connection with building byelaws      so as to avoid unnecessary ohslays.  A sketch of  the      necessary clauses for this purpose is set out in      Appendix II.   The relation  between such a body      and the Treasury would be governed by the terms  on      which grants or loans were made.   The main      objection to this course (and to course (c)) lies      in the difficulty of finding suitable persons to      act as directors, and the still greater difficulty      of changing the system if for any reason it falls      short of expectations.  Conditions laid down by      the Treasury can effectively limit the directors&apos;      powers in such ways as may be thought necessary,      but they cannot supply any want of initiative
          or similar failings which may subsequently appear  if          the original choice proves to be  an unhappy one.          None the less, subject to what is said on the  time-          factor in paragraph 22 below, we  recommend this  system          as probably the &quot;best,  if it is decided that a          substantial number of camps is to be provided.   We          contemplate a separate Association for Scotland,          possibly the newly-formed Scottish National Housing          Association.    20.   As regards the day-to-day running of camps we  thinkthat in the case of school camps the best course would probablybe, following the practice of the National Council of social service, for the Association to provide trie food and attendance,leaving the Education Authority responsible for the discipline of the children.   In the case of holiday camps the Associationmight either run the camps itself  or let them to responsibleorganisations.   Whether they should be at liberty to let campsto concerns who carry on camps on  a commercial basis is a matter on which we have not been able to  arrive at any definite conclusion.    21.   Subject to these points  the  Associations should begiven as free a hand as possible within the limits of the moneyprovided by the Treasury, but Government control on  certain matters v/ould be necessary.    (1)  Location.   Sites would have  to be approved by the A.R.P.Department  in every  case and  in England hy the Board of Education
 in  the  case of a school camp and the Minister of  Health in the case  of a holiday camp and in Scotland by the corresponding authorities.   Special inter--departmental machinery could be set up to avoid delay.   The consent of the Minister of Health would usually be necessary for Planning  and byelaw purposes and also if compulsory acquisition were necessary.    (2)    Price of Land..  In all cases the Association should.be  required to consult the District Valuer and should be encouraged to make  use of his services for negotiationswith ownerss  and we think they should be required in all cases to  obtain the consent of the Ministry of Health in thematter of price.    (3)   Plans and layout should be subject to departmentalapproval.    (4)   Contracts.    Departmental consent to contracts for buildings and works should not be required,  but a limit of  cost per head of accommodation should be fixed beyond which consent would be necessary.    (5)   Staffing arrangements.   These would be left tothe  discretion of the Association.    (6)   Hiring arrangements.    Subject to what we have saidabove, the arrangements for letting camps in peace-time to education authorities and other bodies and persons would beleft to discretion,  but in every instrument of letting a&quot;resumption&quot;  clause enabling the Association to take immediate possession in an emergency would be required,and upon resumption the Association would be placed under an obligation to  hold the camp at the disposal of theGovernment.
                    The Time Factor.     22.   It is clear that the provision of camps on thelines proposed cannot play a part in any short-term warplan.   We have considered the time factor on twoassumptions     (l)  that it is thought necessary to have ready a          number of camps in case of an emergency in the          autumn&quot;     (2)  that it will suffice to secure the camps for          the early months of next year.     (1)  A number of camps (up to, say, 50 for GreatBritain) to be ready by 1st August next.   We think thatthis might be achieved-if the following conditions werefulfilled     (a)  A Government decision to be taken not later than          the 8th February.     (b)  Legislation giving compulsory purchase powers,          and enabling local byelaws, etc., to be over-          ridden, by the end of February.     (c)  Inland Revenue Valuation staff to be employed as          a matter of urgency in finding and negotiating          for sites and/or country mansions.     (d)  The necessary drawings, etc., to be prepared          through H.M.O.W. by the 1st April.     (e)  Normal contract procedure to be dispensed with.          Contracts to be signed and possession of sites          to be given to contractors by the 1st May.     (f)  Contracts to provide for &quot;fast building&quot;.   This          may add about 15% to the cost.            The objections to dealing with the work atthis speed are obvious enough;-     (a)  It would not be possible to get any Association          into working order on this time-table, and
                                                            if! i         consequently the Government would either have  to         take permanent responsibility for the camps, or to         hand them over as a completed scheme or undertaking         to a body who will have had no responsibility  for         their location or construction.     (b)  Apart from the extra cost of 15% mentioned above,         the preparation of the wooden hutments before  the         site is definitely known is certain to involve         unnecessary expense.     (c)  In the absence of comprehensive surveys a falling         short from a carefully considered scheme in respect         of location, general planning and detailed         construction, is inevitable, and, in any case, the         establishment of the camps and the summary         overriding of local byelaws, etc., (without prior         consultation with the authorities, for which there         would be no time) is likely to cause local outcry.         The Councils for the Preservation of Hural England         and Wales and similar bodies would probably join  in         this.   Experience suggests too that difficulties         are not unlikely to arise in obtaining clear entry         to sites at short notice.           We are of the opinion that the programme should notbe attempted at this speed, unless it is put forward anddefended as an urgent war measure.   The execution of this programme depends upon possession of sites being given  tocontractors by 1st May and upon reasonably favourable conditions in respect of availability of labour and materials.     ( 2)  A similar number of/camps secret^e^eaj^by.1st March. 194-0.   In this case the time-table might be asfollows:-     (a)  A Government decision not later than the        22nd February.
Necessary legislation and the formation of the Association(including the  appointment of directors  and  staff;  hy  themiddle of March.The Valuation staff to be available for finding andnegotiating for sites and/or mansions    (d) Surveys of the sites to be ready by the 1st June.    (e) The necessary drawings and approximate quantities  to be        complete by the middle of July.    (f) The contract to be signed by the middle of August.           This programme vrould not necessitate wide departures from normal contract procedure,  but we  desire to emphasise  that  it is  possible of execution only if the sites are available  to contractors by the middle of August.           There are a number of  other considerations in favour of the second and more lengthy time-table.    If  a substantial  programme of  camps  is to be  attempted,  there is room for experiments  in  a considerable variety of types,  an-d experiments in the grouping  of camps,  each camp  serving a different purpose,  might be  well worth- attempting .           We suggest also that,  given the  necessary time, the Association might  find  it useful  to  negotiate  with some of  the big employers  of labour (including the railway companies  and other public utilities,  and possibly the larger local authorities) with  a view  to the construction of  camps  by  the Association which would be leased by  these bodies on  a yearly basis  or  possibly  for  a longer  term. It  is known  that some of  the  railway companies have under consideration  proposals  for the provision  of oamps.          Negotiations  of  a similar kind might also be undertaken with the larger Education Authorities  and possibly also with Local Authorities who are prepared to  exercise their powers under the Physical Training Act.
     23.    Summary, of Conclusions.      (l)   Camps  would serve  a valuable  purpose for each of the three objects  -  schools,  holiday-makers, refugees (paras. 4, 5 and 6).      (2)   Even  if all  the camp accommodation theoretically desirable  for  school camps were provided. (158,000 places), and a  similar  amount for holiday-makers,  it would make only a small addition to the accommodation likely  to be required for war purposes.    Camps cannot be an alternative to billeting, but would  be a valuable supplement by way of shelter for &quot;non-effectives&quot; of all kinds, and for  conversion into auxiliary  hospitals (para. 6).    (3)   The dual use of  a camp for children and adult holiday-makers is possible,  but.a dual  use would he unduly expensive  and  would not be likely to prove attractive to the latter.    (4)   Apart from the time-factor the finding of sites should not prove  a serious difficult;/ (para.11).    (5)   The capita.1  cost of a camp for children is about  50 a head.    The  annual  cost of such a camp (excluding food and attendance) is estimated at  about 4s.8d. a week per child, if the camp is fully occupied for five months of the year (para.12).    (6)   The corresponding figure for a camp for adult holiday-makers is  about 7s.8dn,if the camp is fully occupied for four months  in  the  year  (para.14).    (7)   The cost  of  food and attendance is estimated at about 11s.Od,   a week  in the  case of a  school child and about 17s.Od. in the case of  an adult.    (8)   We think  that, if camps were provided and accommodationwere offered t  o Education Authorities on the half-and-halfbasis suggested  in  para. 16,  the offer would prove acceptable.
     (9)   Similarly, having regard to the comparatively  lowcharge which the half-and-half basis would permit  for  holiday-makers, we think that there would be no difficulty in  fillinga moderate number of camps,,    (10)   If a substantial programme of camps is decided on,the work  &quot;should be done centrally, and preferably by  anon-profit-making Association operating with grants and  loans from the Exchequer.   But if a considerable instalment ofcamps is required by the 1st August, the time-factor wouldmake it necessary for the Government to carry out  the  programmethrough the Office of V/orks.   On the ground of expense  andfor other reasons a longer period for completion  is very desirable (para. 22).                       (Signed)   E. J. MAUDE,                               On behalf of the Conference.Ministry of Health,     Whitehall, S.W.1.25th January, 1939.
                         Postscript.-                     1 i)          After this report was in draft we saw, on theinstructions of the Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Stanley Adams, theChairman of Thomas Cook and Son,  Limited, andMr. W. K. Hamlyn, F.R.I.B.A., Architect to the L-.M..S.    Theyproduced plans of a holiday camp which is now being erectedat Prestatyn, North Wales, by a company, British HolidayEstates Ltd., in which the two concerns have shares,  for thegeneral public.   The camp is to occupy a space of 53 acres,the price being  250 per acre ( 13,000 in all).   It  is to accommodate 1,500 persons, and the total cost will be approximately  187,000 ( 115 per person).   Charges between 2.10s.0d. and  3.10s.0d. will be made.   The camp will beready in June.   It is being built on a lavish scale  and wil!be almost certainly the most attractive holiday camp  in thecountry,          The Company would be prepared to enlarge the campto hold 2,000 persons at an additional cost of  43,000 ifthey could get some Government assistance.   In an emergencythe camp could be enlarged to accommodate a considerably greater number.   Mr. Adams suggested the possibility ofthe Government paying the capital sum required ( 43,000) andcharging a suitable rent.          We have considered this proposal, but unless theprospect of obtaining this additional accommodation by Juneis regarded as of vital importance, we do not think thatit should be entertained, partly on the ground that the camp is being built on a most lavish scale, and partly because owing to its size and lay out it would be a mostconspicuous and vulnerable object.
