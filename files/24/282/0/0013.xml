THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HISBRITANNICMAJESTY&apos;S COVERNMENT.SECRET.COPY NO.46CP. 13 (39).G A B I N E TFleet Air Arm.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The object of this Memorandum is to lay before mycolleagues,in broad outline, the existing state of the Fleet Air Arm, and themeasures which my. advisers and I consider necessary for its development up to the 31st March, 1942.    2,   The review of defence requirements in CI.D. paper1215.B of March, 1935, envisaged an expansion of the Fleet Air Armto a first line strength of 504 aircraft on the 31st March, 1942,but did not enter into ways and means of reaching and maintaining that strength.   The subsequent transfer of the control of theFleet Air Arm from the Air Ministry to the Admiralty, and the laterdecision whereby the Admiralty became responsible for specialisedtraining, raised problems requiring much discussion between thetwo Departments before a detailed programme for the expansion couldbe presented.   Account has also had to be taken of certaindeficiencies revealed by the crisis in September last.    3.   The result is now summarised in an Appendix, in which forthe sake of simplicity the requirements are expressed in termsof aircraft, personnel and shore bases.   Resources and requirements are given for 31st March, 1939, and requirements for 31st March,1942,the conclusion of the five year period of re-armament.   The figures are only the bare outline of the position and their purpose is to illustrate in simple terms the state of the Fleet Air Arm at thebeginning of the next financial year, and the scale of expansionthat will be required to meet the approved programme for thedevelopment of the Fleet itself, including the provision of aircraft for
for the five aircraft carriers now  under  construction.   Theexpansion required increases rapidly in 1940  and  approaches  the1942 requirement in 1941.AIRCRAFT.    4.   The total requirements for March,  1942,  are calculated as follows:-the approved 1942 Fleet is estimated&apos; at 490 aircraft.    Animmediate reserve of 100% is provided so that the  first line shallalways he maintained at full strength.    For training purposesan initial equipment of 341 aircraft is required,  with a reserve to he made for a war reserve calculated to meet war wastage,additional provision for training services- and some expansionof first line, until requirements are overtaken by increased war production.   On certain assumptions in regard to peace productionand acceleration of production in war, this war reserve is estimatedat some 490 aircraft, giving a. total requirement of 1954 aircraft on 51st March, 1942.    5,   The interim requirements for the 31st March, 1939, areworked out on similar principles for the Fleet then in being.PERSONNEL.    5.   The figures given are for the total personnel on  the active List only, exclusive of men under training.   Under present arrangements, and until they can be built up with Naval personnel,the provision of the balance is a commitment of the Royal. Air Force,following the former system of dual control.7.   Shore Bases are required -     (l)  For the specialised courses for flying personnel          before they are sent to service squadrons.     (2)  For the normal shore training of squadrons          disembarked from H.M. Ships which cannot          economically be done from them, and will in future          involve some 6 to 8 months of the year being          spent in shore stations.The first line strength required for the  equipment ofof 143 for immediate replacements.In addition provision hasBASES.

The figures show that on the 31st March, 1939, there willhe deficiencies under all heads, seriously affecting the readiness of the Fleet for war, and that; a large effort and a correspondinglarge expense is necessary not only to overtake these deficiencies,hut also  to meet the large expansion that will he necessary toy31st March, 1942.    The protolem is aggravated at every point toy the strain put upon the national resources toy the much larger expansionof the Royal Air Force that is taking place over the same period.AIRCRAFT  DEFICIENCIES.    9.    The numtoers do not show the true position, as many of those shown as  available on the 31st March, 1939, will toe out of date and near the  end of their useful life.   There is a serious deficiency in fighter aircraft of which the Fleet Air Arm virtually has noneexcept a  handful of otosolete types.   It is hoped to obtain someR.A.F. types from the R.A.F..before next March.    10.   There is a still greater numerical deficiency in TorpedoSpotter Reconnaissance aircraft, the backbone of the Fleet Air Arm,which will not be overtaken until near the end of the expansion period.    II.   The need for large numbers of aircraft of new typesdesigned  for the specialised requirements of the Fleet Air Arm hasbeen fully realised for years past.   The urgencj&apos;- of the need hasmade it necessary to place orders for these &quot;off the board&quot;, &quot;butthe results hitherto have been disappointing.   A notable instancehas been  the considerable delay in coming into service of the &quot;Skua&quot;and &quot;Roc&quot; types which accounts for the deficiency in this class.Moreover  it is still doubtful whether or not the defects of thesetwo types can be sufficiently overcome to enable them to be regardedas effective first line aircraft.
                                                               4 a 0                                                               1\J0                            - 4  -     12.   As  far as  possible aircraft of  civil types in lieu of  service types will be used for specialised training, with a corresponding saving  of  cost.   Obsolescent service  types will also be used as far as possible when they have been replaced by  new types in the first  line. PERSONNEL.     IS.   The decision to transfer the control of the Fleet Air Arm to  the Admiralty inevitably left the Navy with the problem of providing large numbers of  personnel for whom the R.A.F. were formerly  exclusively responsible, e.g. the whole of the maintenance personnel and a proportion  of the flying personnel.   It will be seen that a  good start lias been made, but it is bound to take time to  train  the men in their  new specialist duties.          This applies particularly to the very important artificer grades, who  require 3-4 years Initial training.   The problem is one  of recruitment and training in competition with the demands of  the other Fighting Services and the Rearmament programme, and until the deficiencies in Naval personnel have been overtaken, the Fleet Air Arm will have to  rely upon the Royal Air Force to make thern good as  far as possible.    The Fleet Air Arm expansion programme therefore depends largely  on the ability of the R.A.F. to make good these deficiencies.    Consideration is being given to the possible further dilution of skilled ratings in the ships of the Fleet in order to  release men for the Air Arm, but the Fleet itself has beenfaced with a similar problem for the last 3-4 years owing to the low  recruitment in the post war years until 1936, and to the now increasing number of ships. TRAINING- Arm SHORE BASES.     14.  The whole of the  shore training has hitherto been provided by  the Royal Air Force, which will continue to be responsible for the  training  of pilots up to the point where specialised naval training begins.   It is hoped that at an early date the Navy willbe in a position to undertake the specialised training and also                                                       the......
 the training of Observers and Air Gunners.    For this purpose shore bases  are necessary,  and arrangements  are  being made with  the Air Ministry for the Navy to take over  on or soon after  1st April, 1939, four l:i.A.F* Stations  as follows:   Lee-on-Solent, Worthy Down, Ford and Donibristle, together with an  aerodrome at Eastleigh on lease from civil  authorities.    The  facilities in  these Stations are,  however,  limited,  and.  expenditure, will  be necessary to equip them for Naval needs.    They are  totally inadequate for  the Naval specialist courses for  torpedo  pilots,  or for  the  shore  training of  squadrons disembarked from H.M.  Ships, much of  which  is in the use  of the torpedo,  the  principal weapon of  the Fleet Air Arm. To  find aerodromes for  these purposes within eaey  reach  of the Home Ports  from some  of which torpedo  dropping can  take place will be no easy matter.    15.  Donibristle  is  recognised  to be a most unsatisfactory aerodrome, and a new  station in this area is an urgent requirement.There  is also special need for  a new training  station in the West of England...   Sites for  these two new stations are being explored and it  is hoped to advance them rapidly  in 1939.    16.  A new repair and maintenance establishment is urgently needed.   A site has been selected  near Portsmouth, and it is intended, to advance this item as rapidly as  possible in 1939.    17.  Storage accommodation  for  reserves  of material is necessary.Premises have been leased in Coventry and consideration is being- given  to duplication  of  storage in  the West.    13.  Approval has  already  been given to an embryo war base in the  Orkneys, and certain other war requirements have to be provided in Scotland.    19,  The expansion  of the Fleet Air  Arm  from  1940 will necessitate  the provision by 1942 at latest  of three  further bases in addition to those  referred to above.   One  of  these bases will be in  lieu of Eastleigh.   An additional Armament  Training Station will  also be required.                                                    J Jr-iCu O . . . . . .
llyBASES ABROAD.    20.  It has not yet heen possible to ascertain the extentto which the Fleet Air Ainu will be able to rely on sharingR.A.F. Stations at places abroad, or where it will be necessaryto establish new Fleet Air Arm Bases.   The total aerodromeaccommodation at Singapore, for instance, is inadequate for aFar Eastern war.EXPENDITURE.    21.  It is impossible at this stage to prepare precise estimates of the expenditure likely to be incurred in carrying out this programme.   This applies particularly to new aircraft, wherebesides uncertainty about future wage rates and costs of materials,there is uncertainty about the design and cost of new types.   again the requirements and cost of the new Bases have not yet been worked out in any detail.   It is clear that a large administrative and productive effort is necessary to carry out this programme to keep pace with the expansion of the Fleet Air Arm, and complete it by1942, failing which there would be a corresponding carry-over to subsequent years.    22.  With these reservations, the nearest estimate that can begiven of the cost of maintaining the Fleet Air Arm during the next three financial years, and bringing it up to the required strength on the 31st March-, 1942, amounts to a total of  33-g- millions excludingBases, and the estimated total capital cost of altering the Basestransferred from the R.A.F., and of providing the new home Bases asshown, amounts to  5-g- millions of which the portion falling withinthe ration period together with the cost and maintenance of the Basesduring that period is estimated at  4,700,000.    S3.  I should be glad to receive the authority of my colleagues to proceed with this programme, subject of course to discussion withthe Treasury on points of detail affecting expenditure.
