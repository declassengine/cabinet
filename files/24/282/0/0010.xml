          (THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY   OP        HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT).ECRET.     1.   We desire to obtain Cabinet authority for thepreparation and introduction of a short Bill making threeminor amendments in the Local Government Superannuation Act,1937, and one in the corresponding Scottish Act,   Theprincipal object of the two Acts, which-come into operation onthe 1st April, 1939, and the 16th May, 1939, respectively, isto impose an obligation on local authorities to providesuperannuation allowances for their whole-time officers (as distinct from servants), but the opportunity was taken ofrepealing and re-enacting the earlier law relating to the superannuation of local government officers, and of clearing up a number of points of doubt and difficulty.     2.   In the course of the preparation of the regulationsnecessary to bring the new Acts into operation certain pointshave come to light on which amendments will be necessary ifeffect is to be given to the obvious intentions of Parliament,and injustice to individual officers avoided.   They are asfollows:-     (a)  Reciprocal arrangements between England and Scotland.          The Local Government and other Officers          Superannuation Act, 1922, applied both to England          and Scotland.   In 1937 separate Acts were passed,          both Acts providing for &quot;reciprocal arrangements&quot;          designed to secure that service in Scotland should          count for English pensions and vice versa.. P.10(59).copy cabinet,LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION ACT, 1937.LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1937.    Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the          Secretary of State for Scotland,
          It appears,  however,  that  as  the Acts  are  drafted,          these arrangements can only he  applied to  future          and not to past service.    An amendment to extend          the relevant sections to past service  is required.     (&quot;b)   Service in Institutions for Mental Defectives.          Officers employed in these institutions in England          are in general provided for under  a special Act          (the Asylum Officers Superannuation Act, 1909, as          extended by the Asylums and Certified Institutions          (Officers Pensions)  Act,  1918)  and are consequently          excluded from the English  Act of  1937.  The          exclusion has, however, been  drawn a little too          widely, and unless an amendment is made a  substantial          number of these officers  who  as a  result of the          Local Government Act, 1929, elected to come under the          Act of 1922 (now repealed) will be left &quot;in the  air&quot;          and will have a genuine grievancea     (c)   Employees of London Passenger Transport Board.          Under the London Passenger Transport Act,  1933,,          employees of a local authority  who were transferred          to the service of the Board were  allowed to remain          under the Act of 1922, now repealed, if they so          desired, and many of them elected to do so.   It          appears, however, that it  is  at least doubtful          whether the effect of the  new Act is not to oust them          altogether from superannuation  rightsj  and the          opportunity should be taken to  make it clear that          their rights are not affected.    The London Passenger          Transport Board, who have been  consulted,  agree.     3,   A Bill dealing v/ith these  three points will be very short and, we believe, entirely non-contentious.  We are advised that the long title of the  Bill can be so drawn as to exclude more general amendment of the A.ct of 1937.   Noquestion of Exchequer money arises,  and the Treasury concur in                         2.
the proposals.    The Bill should,  if possible,  reach thestatute hook by the 1st April next;  otherwise  it will be necessary  to make it retrospective.   It would not &quot;be suitablefor introduction in the Lords, since each of the amendmentsmight have some very slight effect on the incidence of rates.                                      W. E.
