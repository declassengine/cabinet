THIS DbCTJMyjNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRETfl                                            . COPY NO.   44CP. 6 (59).                    CABINET.                THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY *           REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.He mo rand urn &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.   1. During the course of last year public opinion was increasingly directed towards the condition of the british shipping industry and on several occasions during debates inParliament demands have been made for Government assistance.In the debate on 8th July last, I repeated a statement whichhad been made by my predecessor in 1954, that the government recognised the vital importance of the shipping industry tothis country and were prepared to give it help in any waysatisfactoryj, not excluding financial help if the case weremade out.  I pointed out that the first move must andshould come from the industry, which should itself examinewhat were the possible ways of helping itself;  but Iadded that the Government would be ready to give sympathetic consideration to any representations the industry might make as a result of its inquiries.   2.  As a consequence, the shipowners&apos; organisations (theChamber of Shipping and the Liverpool Steam Ship Owners&apos;Association) immediately set on foot a comprehensive inquiry into the position of the industry in all sections;  and theresults of that inquiry have now been communicated to me.They comprise a series of &quot;fact-finding&quot; reports dealing withthe various sections of the industry and a report on policycontaining recommendations as regards the action which shouldbe taken0 I attach the report on policy for the informationof my colleagues.                        -1-
30  The main proposals, which have received wide  publicitythe press, are as follows:-  A0 Measures of financial assistance,,     (l) Tramp shipping - subsidy of  2-g- millions for     deep-sea tramps and  -g- million for tramp ships in     the Near-Continental trades to &quot;be made available     in each of the next five years, on terms and     conditions based  on those applicable to the previous     tramp subsidy, &quot;but embodying some modifications     based on the experience  then gained,,     (2) Liners - a defence fund  of  5 millions per     annum for five years to  be available for     distribution in  grants for acquiring  ships or in     operating  subsidies  according  to  the  recommendations     of an  independent committee  where a  case for     assistance  for  any service  is  made  out,      (5)  Coasting Trade - subsidy of  500,000 per  annum     for tramps  in  the coasting  trade, with an      &quot;adequate  and  equalising subsidy&quot; for coastal      liners. B. Other Measures,      (1) Shipping provisions in commercial arrangements.      The Government to take  every opportunity &quot;to      improve, by way  of Commercial Arrangements, the      scope of British shipping employment&quot;.  In      particular, the  Government should -           (i) force Russia,  and arrange with the other           timber exporting countries  (including Canada)           to use an  increasing quantity  of British           shipping in the carriage of their timber  to           the United Kingdom;  and           (ii) negotiate Agreements for  the fullest           employment of  Britsh  tonnage  in the carriage
          of coal exports to Near-Continental  countries.      (2)  Coasting vessels.          (i)  Cargoes carried coastwise  for Government          Departments, public authorities or public  utility-          undertakings, and coastwise cargoes  of commodities          subject to Government aid,  to be carried in          British vessels.          (ii) Protection of coasting tramps and liners          against unfair competition from railway and road          transport.     Tankers.          The tanker owners do not put forward airy general     proposals, but wish to discuss their position with the     Government in view of the foreign competition from     which they are suffering.   4. The case for assistance to the shipping  industrydepends on this occasion, not as before upon the weakness ofthe financial position of any particular section (e.g. thetramp section) of the industry, but upon the plea that theindustry generally is unable to hold its own against thecompetition of foreign flags, and will thus be unable tomaintain the mercantile marine at a level adequate for thenational needs (see paragraph 8 on page  6 of the report).   5. Whether the industry has made out  a case on these grounds and whether the remedies proposed would be calculated to further the object  in view, are matters&apos;for consideration,but I desire to remind my colleagues that the adequacy of theUnited Kingdom merchant fleet in view  of our needs in war has recently been under consideration  by the Committee ofImperial Defence and  that there is much  to be said for anincrease in  our shipping.  The industry  state  (on page 22 oftheir report) that  they would be prepared,  if so desired, to look further  into the  possibility of creating a  reserve  of
tonnage for emergency purposes.   60 Shipbuilding. -  The proposals submitted by theshipping industry do not include any specifically directed to the increase of mercantile shipbuilding in this country.As my colleagues may be aware, the shipbuilding industrycalled my attention some time ago to the depression fromwhich it is suffering through the present and prospectivepaucity of orders for merchant shipbuilding.  I discussed the  situation with representatives of the ShipbuildingConference last month when it was agreed to await the receiptof the shipping industry&apos;s proposals, the decision on which,it was recognised, might have an important influence on theprospects of the shipbuilding industry.  The  shipping industry (on page  23 of  their report) express their willingness to co-operate with  the Board of Trade and shipbuilding industry  &quot;in an immediate  consideration of  the vital  and urgent problem of  shipbuilding and  of  the  actionwhich  should be  taken  in regard to  it.&quot;   70 In view of  the  national and international aspects  ofthe  problems connected with  the question  of  preserving  our shipping and shipbuilding industries,  I regard a government decision on  these  questions  as  a matter of great urgency and I suggest  that they should be referred to a Cabinet  Committeefor  immediate  investigation  and report.

t          NOT FOR PUBLICATIONPrivate and Confidential.CHAMBER OF SHIPPING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                      and liverpool STEAM  SHIP OWNERS&apos; ASSOCIATIONJOINT SHIPPING POLICY  committee report\oth January, 1939.
                      PRIVATE AND  CONFIDENTIAL.REPORT OF JOINT SHIPPING POLICY  COMMITTEEOF  CHAMBER  OF  SHIPPING   AND   LIVERPOOL        STEAM SHIP OWNERS&apos; ASSOCIATION.   I.  This Report embodies the proposals for the support ofBritish Shipping which it is desired to place before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as a result of an exhaustive investigation conducted by the Chamber of Shipping and Liverpool Steam Ship Owners&apos;Association and  covering all Sections of the  Industry and all relevant factors.  These proposals are propounded as best  ableto secure the welfare of the  British  Mercantile Marine inthe face  of severe and increasing foreign competition, largelyitself State-aided or  artificially fostered.   These  proposalsfollow logically upon the  unanimous recommendation of theIndustry in 1934, viz., that :                            N       &quot; When any section  of the British Mercantile Marine   can show that a  temporary  subsidy is necessary  and  will   ensure its preservation  for the  time,  H.M.  Government   should favourably consider the granting of  such a subsidy,   taking care not to prejudice other competing sections  of   British Shipping  thereby.&quot;   It  was in the spirit of that resolution that  the  originalTramp Subsidy was  sought and granted.   A series of reports prepared by  Fact  Finding committees in the course of that investigation accompany this Report andcomprise : 
    Report of the Deep Sea Tramp Fact Finding Committee,    Summary of replies to Deep Sea Liner Questionnaire,    Report of the Near Continental Trades and  Russia Fact       Finding Committee,    Report of  the Coasting  Fact  Finding Committee,    Report of the Tanker Fact Finding  Committee,    Report on Shipping and  Shipbuilding,    Memorandum on British Trade and Shipping Statistics,    Memorandum on Shipping  and Shipbuilding Subsidies.    2.  The proposals now submitted and elaborated in  detailhereunder represent  but temporary remedies, but their applica-tion is essential if the decline of British shipping is to be arrested,and a new era of progress developed.    In the face of trading conditions such as  have existed during the greater part of  thepast decade  and against  competition  of the  character which british Shipping is meeting, in many cases virtually competitionagainst   Governments,  no  Industry  economically  operatedcan indefinitely  hold  its  own.   As  a  permanent remedy,the restoration and  maintenance  of World Trade  is essential,coupled with the ability   of the  United Kingdom  to  sharefully  and proportionately  in  an improvement in trade whenit comes.   3.  That this ability of  the  United Kingdom  to  sharefully  in  existing or future trade is in question, is proved bymuch of the information collected in the course of the presentinvestigation and by past experience. In  the  period 1925/1929,when the World was recovering from the immediate post-Wardepression and World trade was on the up-grade, the UnitedKingdom,   alone  of  all the  great  nations  except Russia,failed to share proportionately in that increase of international trade.  During  the  present   investigation   the  Shipowners&apos;Organisations   have  accumulated   a   volume   of   evidenceindicative  of   loss  of  carrying trade   to   British  ships  byreason of loss  of  export markets by British Manufacturers,  and
of the increasing tendency of British export industries to becomenon-competitive  in  World markets.   This tendency, indeed,applies not only to the industries exporting our  manufactures,but  to  British shipping itself, which is  our most  importantexport industry and which is increasingly  hampered by its  ownlevels of costs of  building,  operating, supplies, compliance withrules and regulations and  the  like  in  comparison  with  thoseof its foreign competitors.    4..  The degree and nature of the foreign competition withwhich British  Shipping is faced are matters which are  dealtwith in detail in the Reports of the Fact Finding Committees.These Reports show that, far from decreasing  in  the  circum-stances of reduced trade which have ruled during the greaterpart  of  the last  ten years,  that competition  has constantlyincreased.  They show, too, a continuous intensification of thesupport given by foreign Governments to their national shipping,support which is in part financial and in part given by way ofpolitical pressure and artificial devices and aids of various kinds.This foreign competition  affects all classes  of British  Shippingwhether Liner, Tramp or Tanker.  As a result of reduced  trade,,and growing  foreign competition,  the  United  Kingdom  shareof  World Shipping has  become  progressively less  and theUnited  Kingdom mercantile  marine  has  declined  both  in tonnage and in number of  ships, with consequent loss of availableman-power.   That decline has been marked in  many Deep Seatrades arid still  more  marked  in the smaller class of  tonnageengaged in the Near Continental Trades.    Special attention needs to be called to Japanese competitionboth because of its character and because  of the threat latentin  it to the future of  British Shipping.  In so  far as it is sub-i subsidised and aided by exchange  control and other  devices, it isnot in character  peculiar.  Its  peculiarity  and danger arise inthe fact  that it  is operated on standards considerably below those of  this and other European countries  and that throughthe Japanese  system of combining  under one  organisation thebusinesses both of ship-owning and merchanting, it is assured
that  Japanese  trade,  both  import  and  export, follows theJapanese flag.  Hitherto this Japanese shipping competition hasbeen in the  main confined to trades based on Japan, but theJapanese sea-going merchant navy of vessels of 2,000 tons grossand upwards has increased by over 200 per cent, since 1914 and byabout 25  per cent, since as recently as 1929, and further sub-stantial increase is to be brought about in the near  future as aresult of a  building  programme   already   embarked  upon.    Under subsidies granted up to April, 1937, there were built17 Japanese  large cargo vessels with speeds of 15 to 18  knots,as compared  with a normal  economic speed of 12 to 15  knots.It is understood that under  more recent subsidies cargo vessels of  even higher speed are being built.  This increased fleet will inevitably  seek  new  and  wider  fields  of  employment andaggravate  the extraordinarily  difficult  problem  that  japanese competition already presents.    5.  British  coasting  tramp  owners  have  urged  that theUnited Kingdom coasting trade should be reserved to Britishtonnage.  The Shipping Industry as a whole maintains its viewthat to shut out from the coasting trade of the United Kingdom,or any part of that trade, vessels under foreign flags, would reactto  the prejudice of  British  shipping  as a whole.    The Industry recognise,  however,  the vital importance  ofmaintaining  an adequate  British coastal  service and  with thisobject submits the  other proposals  of the coasting tramp andliner  trades  in this  Report as designed to preserve  the coastingtrade as an essential part of British shipping and of the Country&apos;internal transport.     Those proposals include  a request  for a  subsidy to Coastal Tramp Shipping for which a prima facie case appears to have been  established.   Such a grant would involve  the  need for an equalising subsidy to  Coastal Liners.
   6.  The Industry recognise the need for discussion with theGovernment of the position of British tanker tonnage in relationto national requirements as suggested by tanker owners, beforedefinite proposals are formulated with regard to  that section ofthe Industry.  In the meantime they commend to the considera-tion of the Government the suggestion that as Admiralty tankersfall due  for replacement, their place should  be  taken by theemployment of British commercial tanker tonnage chartered forGovernment requirements.   The  Industry&apos;s attention has  been drawn to  the favourable terms of reinsurance obtained by foreign tanker owners on theLondon insurance  market. This  represents a disadvantage fromwhich  other sections  of British shipping are also suffering andthe Industry  therefore  propose  to  take  it  up through  theirorganisations with the Underwriters.    7.  The Industry is  necessarily the first to  appreciate thevalue of the freest international  exchange of goods and servicesupon which it depends and therefore of the  need to minimiseworld  trade barriers.    The  Industry is therefore  not recommending a return to aNavigation Act Policy, though  it  is forced to recognise thatin the case of Russia,  by reason of the methods  employed  by russia in the exercise of a state monopoly in trade and shipping,special measures  require to  be  adopted  and further,   that circumstances may arise to call for  special  measures against any action by certain nations to the prejudice of British shippingwhich it may not be possible  to counter  by  financial  supportalone.    The great  purchasing power of the United Kingdom andthe immense resources of the  Empire provide, however, oppor-tunity to assist British shipping when  trade  treaties are being negotiated and it is urged that the Government  should make use of this negotiating power whenever oppportunity arises toimprove by  way of commercial  arrangements  the  scope ofBritish shipping employment.
    8.   The financial assistance which the  Industry now  seeksis sought upon the assumption that it is in the National interest that British shipping should decline no further but progress.   Ithas hitherto been forced  to  adjust  itself  to circumstances, and,if left to itself, must continue to do so.  If it is to be maintained in  the face  of  foreign  competition,  then,  like  that foreigncompetition, it must have suffort.    9.   In the following pages the proposals of each Section  areevolved in detail.
           I. DEEP SEA  TRAMP PROPOSALS.   The Industry  is convinced  that unless  some special  and immediate action  is taken  by His Majesty&apos;s Government, theBritish tramp fleet will be  unable to maintain  even  its present strength and efficiency or to play its proper part in the tradeand defence of  the country.  Moreover, if- expansion is desired,the need for  definite action is even more apparent.   The Industry therefore urges His Majesty&apos;s Government totake positive and  immediate action and not to delay  untilreserves of  strength  are reduced  to a point when far more costly remedies would be required.   British tramp shipowners make the following proposals : (i) That the  Government should be asked to renew the subsidy   for tramp voyages  on the basis of the White Papers,  cmd.   4754 and 5082, subject  to the following alterations :    (a) Amount of subsidy to be  zi millions per annum.   (b) The subsidy to be payable for a minimum of  5 years.   (c) The subsidy to  apply to deep sea tramp voyages  per-      formed by vessels of 2,500 gross tons  and over.   (d) The subsidy also to apply to voyages  on which cargo      is  carried  on berth terms in such  trades  as  may be      approved for this purpose by the Tramp representatives      and also by the  Liner  representatives  on the Subsidy      Committee.   (*?) Datum Line to  be  fixed  to  represent the old  subsidy      level of 1929, with the addition of  a percentage increase      to allow for  increased costs between 1935 (when the old      subsidy was first paid) and the present day.
(/)  Compliance with the minimum  freight schemes of the    Tramp Shipping Administrative  Committee  as  in force    from time to time, to be a condition of receipt of subsidy.In  addition,  the  subsidy to be administered so as to ensurethat :    (g) British subjects are (with such modifications on the lines      of those adopted by the last Subsidy Committee as may      be  found necessary) employed  as  crew where available ;   (A) National Maritime Board Agreements, where applicable,       to  be  complied -with  (any question of application  and       interpretation of these Agreements to be referred to the       appropriate National  Maritime Board panel).(2) Circumstances may arise to call for special measures against    any action  by certain nations to the  prejudice of British    shipping  which  it  may not  be  possible  to  counter  by    financial support alone.
II.   DEEP SEA AND NEAR TRADES LINER                  PROPOSALS.Liner Defence Fund and Commission.    To meet the continued threats  made  to  British Lines two things  are essential     I  that there should be a capable  authority  to which the Lines      could come when threatened,  or in need, and    2  that  the authority should  have power  to  aid and power      to act promptly in giving that aid.    It  is suggested     (i) that Parliament should vote a  sum  of  5,000,000  perannum for  five years  to be used or carried  forward  each yearto  create a Liner  Defence  Fund,  to  be available  to  supportBritish Liner  services.    (2) that this Fund should be administered by the Treasury,who shall act on the advice of  a Commission of three independentmen, a Chairman and  two  colleagues, it  being made clear to  andby  Parliament that the recommendations of the Commission  willbe  followed 3    (3) that when  a Line  or  Group of  Lines in a trade or oneof its services  is threatened or in need it should be able to applyat  once  to  the Commission for aid.    (4) that applications may be made to the  Commission byany British Line or Group of Lines     (a) which is maintaining a service or services in which actual        trading losses  are being incurred, or likely to be incurred,        or  in  which  depreciation is not being made owing to        the intensity of competition direct or indirect with ships        that have  received  capital  aid from the  Government        of  another   country  or  are  being  aided  in  their        operation  by  Government money, exchange  or freight
                                                             /                              10        control,  nationalistic influences, or any  action calculated        to divert, direct or  influence  the  shipment of cargo or        movement  of passengers  to  the  disadvantage  of the        services  for which the applicants are responsible,  or with        ships of  other countries  seeking to  force  entry  into an        established trade or to deprive British owners of  cargo        by undercutting freight or  passenger rates, or    ( )  which is suffering,  or likely  to suffer, from any  other        adverse  circumstance actual or threatened;    (5) that the  Commission should have power to     (a)  recommend capital  grants  towards the building  of new        vessels and the acquisition or reconstruction of  existing        ones or  replacement of engines  by engines of higher        speed, or    ( )  recommend grants towards operating expenses renewable        from year to year subject to the fund remaining adequate        to  meet known  equal and   superior  claims and  to  a        continuance  of the  circumstances justifying  the  initial        grant.           NOTE:  Aid from the Liner Defence Fund would        be distinct from any aid that  may prove to be necessary        for British Shipbuilding to meet differentials in building        costs over  those of foreign  countries.    (6)  that  the Commission, in addition  to hearing the Appli-cants,  would take into  consideration any reactions  that the suggested  aid  might  have on  shipowners   other  than the applicants and would give any British owners apprehending suchreactions an  opportunity  to be heard.                    ;    (7)  Co-operation as a condition of aid.    Any Line or  Lines  who unreasonably  compete with  other british  Lines shall not be  allowed to participate  in any of theadvantages of the Defence  Fund,  always subject  to their rightto present their  case to the  Commission. .
y    The  Commission may attach  to its  recommendation of anyaid such conditions  of co-operation with other Lines or branchof Shipping,  British or foreign, as the Commission may considerdesirable and, in particular,  a condition requiring those  respon-sible  for the Line  or Lines or  Service aided to refrain  fromunreasonable competition with other British  Lines.    (8) Aid to be for Services rather than Companies.    The Commission should be prepared to recognise that a LinerCompany may be able to hold its own or make progress in oneor  some of its services while unable to  do so in another.   the mere  fact  that  a Company may  be  on the  whole prosperousshould not debar it from receiving or sharing aid for a servicethat needs aid.    (9) Having regard  to the fact  that the  Near  ContinentalLines  have  suffered and are  suffering gravely from  intenseforeign competition, often supported by foreign Governments,combined with peculiar injury from the change in  British tariff policy, and  in  view of  the national  importance of  having  asufficient supply  of their class of tonnage in  an emergency, a pro-portion of the Liner Defence Fund, namely  500,000, shouldbe earmarked for the needs and support of the Liner trades with europe,  the  Mediterranean,  North  Africa  and  the  Canaries,apart  from  any sums  necessary to  aid  building  or  to  meetdifferential  building costs.    (10) The Commission should, follow closely the position  ofBritish shipping and should  be free to make to the government from time to time  any representations it thinks  fit as to actionwhich  in its  opinion the  Government could  or  should usefullytake for  the  defence and promotion of the interests of british shipping.    (11) It should  therefore not only  be open to shipownersto  apply to  the Commission when financial  help  is suggestedbut also  to lay before it any case where British  shipping or any section of it is in need of support or to draw  its attention to any circumstances in  which it could usefully make representations  tothe Government, notably  as to  action that might be taken, byor in Trade Treaties or in any other way whatever, to  promote the interests  of  British shipping.
 III.    NEAR CONTINENTAL  TRADES PROPOSALS.    (i)  While proposals are made below for subsidy the positionof British shipping in the  trades to and from the Continent ofEurope  has, owing to the virtual exclusion of British ships fromthe timber trade for so many years by the British  Load line and Deck Cargo Regulations,  deteriorated too far to  admit ofa satisfactory and complete solution by that means alone unlessthe assistance towards both capital and running expenses is very substantial.    The possession of small ships by this country is so vital, both from  the point  of  view  of their immediate importance  and because  small shipowning is the nursery of big shipowning,  thatthe Government  must recognise that the need for help in thesetrades is clear and urgent.    The first and most essential requirement therefore is         (a)  as  regards Russia, the  British Government should    insist that a definite and gradually  increasing proportion of    the  U.K.  imports of whole cargoes  of  timber and its  pro-    ducts be carried in British ships from U.S.S.R. loading ports.    Having regard to the fact that Russia  has herself imposed    and exercised  an absolute monopoly over imports and exports    and their freighting this can be done without it being possible    for  other countries to claim that it involves a  departure from    present  British Navigation policy;        ( )  with all  the other timber exporting  countries  both    in the Baltic  (especially Sweden and Finland) and Canada,    this country has an unfavourable visible balance of trade and    it is suggested  that His Majesty&apos;s Government endeavour    to  obtain  friendly  agreements for the  employment of  an    increasing quantity of British  shipping in the carriage of our    timber  purchases  from   them.   Alternatively,  that  His    Majesty&apos;s  Government  should  arrange with  the  timber    import  trade to  make their own freight  arrangements and,    in  doing so, to  employ  an  increasing  quantity  of  British    shipping.
   The Government should also take  steps to negotiate agree-ments  for  the employment of  British tonnage  to  the fullest possible extent in the carriage of coal exports to Near continental countries to  offset  the  discrimination  or nationalistic influencesoperating there.    (2) In addition to the above a subsidy (on the basis of white papers cmd.  4754 and  5082) should be provided for the  assist-ance of tramp owners in the  Near Continental trades, with thefollowing modifications: - -    (a) the subsidy to  be payable for  a minimum of 5 years;    ( ) the  subsidy to  be  applicable to vessels  of  3,500 tons        gross and under and to be based  on  a graduated scale        in accordance with a formula based on the higher running        and building costs per ton for smaller  vessels;    (c) the subsidy  to  apply  also to voyages on  which cargo is        carried on berth terms in such trades as may be approved        for this purpose by the tramp representatives, and also by        the liner representatives on the Subsidy Committee;    (d) the  amount of the  subsidy suggested provisionally is         500,000.           NOTE:   The amount stated includes vessels  from        2,500 3,500 gross tons, which are also  covered  by the        deep sea tramp proposals.  Some adjustment will be        required to avoid  duplication  of subsidy  to  vessels        between  2,500  and 3,500 gross tons.            In view of the paucity  at present of British ships        covered  by these proposals  and the  desirability  of        acquiring, such tonnage, supplementary  subsidies  may        later be  required;    (e) a  special index number to be  used which will  represent        the  average level of freights in  any  given  year for        vessels of  3,500 gross tons and under  in the trades con-        cerned as  compared  with 1929, with  the addition of a        percentage  increase to allow for increased costs between         x935  (when  the old subsidy was first  paid) and the        present  day;
    (/) compliance with the minimum  freight schemes  of the       Tramp  Shipping Administrative  Committee  or  other       Committee under the a;aegis  of the Chamber of Shipping,       as in force from time to time, to be a condition of receipt       of  subsidy.    In addition, the subsidy  to be  administered  so as to ensurethat    (g) British subjects are (with such modifications on the lines       of  those adopted by  t,he last Subsidy  Committee as may       be  found necessary)  employed  as  crew where  available.   (A) National Maritime Board Agreements, where applicable,       to  be  complied  with  (any question  of  application and       interpretation of these  Agreements to be referred to the       appropriate National Maritime Board panel).    (3) Near  Continental  owners  agree to the  proposal  that  a transport  and Marketing Board should be set up  for the Pales-tine fruit  trade and that  the  Board  should arrange  a freightcontract  with  the British  Conference  Lines and that Britishshipowners should be encouraged  to build or purchase suitabletonnage  to carry the peak  requirements of the trade.    (4)  Circumstances  may  arise  to call  for additional special measures against any action by certain nations to the prejudice ofBritish shipping which  it may not be possible  to counter  by financial support alone.
     IV.  COASTING AND HOME TRADE  TRAMP                       PROPOSALS.1.   SUBSIDY.A.   Coasting Trade.   The Government be  asked  to grant a  subsidy to  BritishCoastal Tramp Shipping,  based  on the following lines :    (a) to be applicable to  all voyages of British vessels when       engaged in the Coasting Tramp Trade ;   (b) to be based on a graduated scale in accordance with a       formula based on present  running  costs according to size ;   (c) a special datum line to be fixed (below which the subsidy       to  be  payable).   The position with regard to the datum       line to be  based on the average level of appropriate open       market coasting tramp freights ;   (d) the subsidy to be for a minimum period of five years;   (e) amount . 500,000 per annum.    In addition the subsidy to be administered so as to ensure      (/) that British subjects  are (with such modifications on the        lines of those adopted by  the last Subsidy Committee as        may be  found  necessary)  employed as  crews where        available;     (g) National  Maritime Board  Agreements, where applicable,        to be  complied with (any question  of application  and        interpretation of these Agreements  to be referred to the        appropriate National Maritime Board panel).    (h) co-operation in the  industry including compliance with       such minimum freight schemes as may be in operation       from time to time.
B.  Home Trade.   A large volume of &quot; Coasting Tramp Tonnage &quot; is regularlyemployed both in the Coasting and in the Home Trades.  the coasting and  Home Trade Tramp Section desires to associate themselves with  the subsidy proposals made  on behalf of theNear Continental Trades, which include home trade voyages.2.  PROTECTION AGAINST UNFAIR RAILWAY COMPETITION.   A firm Government policy is required to ensure competitionon fair terms between Coastwise Tramp Shipping and the  Rail-way Companies.  Control in some form of railway rates as theyaffect Coastwise Shipping,  must remain to ensure -   (a) that  railway rates for the short  hauls  to and  from the       ports (which in the vast majority of cases form the only       means  of collecting  and delivering  coastwise tramp       cargoes) are at the same relative level as the throughout       railway rates for competitive traffics;   (b) that the safeguards  for coastal  shipping under  the  Rail-       ways Acts are effective and  enable coastal shipping to       challenge competitive railway rates and to challenge new       ones before they are put into operation ; and   (c) that  in the administration of railway  ports  adequate       facilities are provided for  coasting shipping and that the       charges for such facilities are reasonable.3.  EXPORT COAL TRADE.   A restoration of  the export coal trade to  France,  belgium and  Holland is of vital importance to a substantial proportionof the tramp tonnage engaged in the Coasting and Home Trades.In particular  the recovery of United  Kingdom coal exports to north France from the Bristol Channel is one of the essentialfactors necessary to achieve the return of healthy conditions tothe class of tramp tonnage employed in the Coasting and HomeTrades.  The Government be asked energetically to pursue itsendeavours to secure a  full restoration of the export coal  tradeto Near Continental countries.
4.   RESERVATION.   Coasting Tramp Owners urge the reservation of the UnitedKingdom Coasting Trade to British tonnage.   After weighingcarefully all considerations they are of opinion that reservation of  the  Coasting Trade would be in the best interests of BritishOwners in that trade, and is the most effective means of pro-tecting them against foreign competition.5.   EMPLOYMENT  OF  BRITISH TONNAGE.   Failing the adoption of reservation of the United kingdom coasting Trade to British tonnage  the Government to use its influence in arranging that cargoes carried coastwise for accountof  Government  Departments,  Municipal  or other  public authorities,  or Public  Utility Undertakings,  and  coastwisecargoes of commodities &quot;which are subject  to  Government  aidin any form are carried in British vessels.6.   EQUALITY  OF  TREATMENT.   Further, Coasting Tramp Owners are not satisfied that thereis  the  same degree of enforcement by the Board of Trade asbetween British and Foreign  ships employed in  the  UnitedKingdom Coasting Trade of those Safety and other Regulations &quot;which are under existing British law applicable to all such ships.They  desire that  the Board of Trade be urged to take  muchfirmer action to ensure in actual practice the same treatment inthis regard of British and foreign tonnage.
                             i8             :          V.   COASTING LINER PROPOSALS. i.  CO-ORDINATION OF INTERNAL GOODS TRANSPORT.    The foremost essential need for  the Coasting Liner trade is effective  co-ordination  between  the railways,  road  hauliers, canals and coasting shipping to avoid unnecessary overlapping of services  and  uneconomic competition.   The Coasting  Liner trade urge the Government energetically to follow up the con- sideration which has been given to this matter by the Transport Advisory  Council in order that a practical scheme of co-ordina- tion  between  all  forms  of  internal goods transport may  be achieved at  the earliest date. 2.  ROAD COMPETITION.    The Coasting Liner trade desires  to draw the attention of the Government to the relative position between the two forms of transport, under which (a) the great national asset of the high- way system  of the country is placed  at the disposal of the Com- mercial Road Users rent free, requiring from them no more than a proportion of the cost of its  maintenance and  development, but (b) coastal shipping has to pay in full for everything  it uses, including the  provision and  maintenance of  docks, channels, lights and all other assets.    The Coasting Liner Section also urge  the Government to take into  close consideration the existing  and  potential  serious effect upon Coastal Liner Shipping as well as upon rail transport of the unrestricted area of operation of  &quot; C &quot;  Licence holders. They submit  that  the Government should seriously consider whether holders of &quot; C &quot; Licences should be restricted to a limit  of area of operation and they  foresee considerable  danger in the  growth in  the  number  of &quot; C &quot; Licence holders who already represent more than two-thirds of the road hauliers. 3.  RAILWAY COMPETITION.   The Coasting Liner Trade associate themselves with  the contention of  Coasting Tramp owners for a firm government policy, to  ensure competition on fair terms between the Coasting
                             i9Trade and the  Railway Companies, including  the contention that the Coasting Trade should not  be placed at a disadvantage in the  matter of  railway  charges between the ports and theinterior for traffic carried coastwise.   Present conference arrange-ments between Coasting Liner owners and the  Railways whichin past years have done  much to  prevent  uneconomic ratecompetition are seriously prejudiced by the growth of  railway&quot; Agreed  Charges&quot;, whereby  the  whole  of  a  trader&apos;s  trafficincluding often a  large variety of  goods regardless of  kind,destination and length of  haul, is  carried at  a flat rate.  the attraction of an &quot; Agreed Charge &quot; to merchants must inevitablytend to divert to rail, traffic for which sea  transport is normallyits most economic route.  &quot; Agreed Charges &quot; are monopolisticin character ; their maintenance is inconsistent with the principleof co-ordination.   Effective co-ordination between  all forms ofinternal goods transport should remove the need for &quot; AgreedCharges &quot; which were  introduced largely, if not  solely, to enablethe  Railways  to meet unrestricted  and unfettered  road  corn-petition.  Coasting Liner owners urge the need  for the abolitionof &quot; Agreed Charges &quot; as an additional reason for Governmentinfluence  and action   to  achieve  co-ordination between  theseveral transport industries.4.   SUBSIDY.    If a subsidy is granted  to Coastal Tramp Shipping it wouldbe essential for an adequate and equalising subsidy to be appliedto  the Coastal Liner  trade if irreparable harm is not to  be caused to that trade.   For a  large volume of traffic carried by coastal Liner shipping there is severe competition with  the coasting Tramp trade.
              VI.  TANKERS&apos;  PROPOSALS.   The control of a sufficient up-to-date fleet of tanker tonnageis a  matter of absolute necessity to this country especially inthe event  of war or  emergency.   Under such conditions  theNation&apos;s requirements of oil may be expected to increase suddenlyand enormously.  To what extent reliance can be placed on theservice  of  foreign tankers is uncertain.   The  question as towhether the Nation can rely on sufficient tanker tonnage being available in such  circumstances  is a matter upon which it is  notpossible to express an opinion.   The present world conditions appear  to necessitate  a study of the cause and effect of the preponderance of the ScandinavianTramp  Tanker Fleet  and its  increasingly rapid  expansion in comparison with  British tonnage.   Briefly, the Norwegians alone have built in the last 16 years199  Tramp Tankers in  comparison with 83  Tramp Tankersbuilt for British owners. These totals include  65 Tramp Tankersof 589,470 gross tons  built for Norwegians and only  20 of169,212 gross tons built for British owners in the last  5 years.At the  end of 1938  there were  under construction 43  TrampTankers of 408,750  gross tons for Norwegians as against 7 of66,300  gross tons for British account.   Amongst other reasons, lower cost of operation and taxationreliefs have undoubtedly encouraged Norwegian ownership,  andit is  evident that  if any substantial amount of tanker tonnage isto be attracted to the British flag some financial incentives arenecessary.   Reference is made in the Fact Finding Report to the owner-ship  of  tankers by the Admiralty.   These vessels were mainlyacquired during the last War and are becoming due for  replace-ment but  it  is hoped that instead  of such replacement  theAdmiralty  will adopt the policy of chartering British  tonnage for their requirements.   British  Tramp Tanker Companies, in common with their foreign  competitors,  have benefited  by  the operation  of  the tanker  Pool, but  on current rates even with the help of the Pooltrading  vessels cannot earn sufficient to cover their depreciation.
The fact that Tanker Owners have established this measure ofinternational co-operation should not  prejudice  their claim to assistance as the Pool cannot prevent increasing foreign corn-petition and in any case being on a voluntary basis it is uncertainhow long it will remain in being.    The facts and circumstances being  as  described it is notpossible for the Tanker Owners to propose  any definite remedywithout first  discussing the matter with the Government but such discussion should not be delayed because it is clear  that unless  some means is  quickly devised of altering the  presentposition, it is  feared that it is only a question  of time beforeBritish Tramp Tanker Shipping  disappears altogether.
                               is                   RESERVE OF TONNAGE.    IO.   Should the  Government so desire the Industry will beprepared  to look  farther  into the  possibility  of  creating  areserve of tonnage for  emergency  purposes.                        SHIPBUILDING.    I I.   The proposals  now  submitted  are  deliberately  con-fined to proposals  to meet the  shipping situation, it being  feltthat the first step must be to restore British  shipping to pros-perity, for without it nothing can avail  British shipbuilding, butit  is recognised  that  the second, though separate step, must beto consider the  shipbuilding position.    It  will be essential  for  British shipowners  to be  able toacquire new tonnage at competitive  world prices.   The power ofthis  country to build ships of the highest quality, and at com-petitive world prices is no less  vital than the  maintenance of anadequate mercantile marine, and the shipbuilding industry mustnot  only be able to  supply the ships required to  maintain  ourtonnage in time of peace but also to  meet any special war require-ments to  make  good  war  losses  and  provide  any additional^tonnage needed to  compensate  for loss of time to ships while in convoy, repair,  etc.  It is understood that the average  costof merchant shipbuilding to-day is approximately 25 per  cent.higher than in the period preceding the  rearmament programme.This means that to build a comparable  ship to-day means mustbe found of reducing or equating present prices to the extent of20 per  cent, of present cost.    There  has been found  great difficulty in.  comparing  Britishwith foreign prices.   It is  stated,  for  instance,  that while theItalian Government  has contributed 30 per cent, of  the  cost ofbuilding vessels in Italy for Italian owners on the ground  thatsuch contribution is necessary  to  equalise Italian with  Britishcosts,  yet  Italian  yards have  actually  built  ships for  foreignowners at  prices substantially below the British  prices.   Similar
loth January, 1939.facts have been given in regard to German building for domestic and  foreign  account.   Scandinavian  yards  in Sweden  and denmark are to-day not only filled with  vessels in course  of construction, but  have on their  books  orders which  will keep them busy for two  years ahead, while British  yards, includingthe Naval orders, are working at less than half of  the capacity to which they have  been reduced by the National ShipbuildersSecurity  rationalisation  plan.   There is lit.de  prospect  of any-substantial amount of merchant shipbuilding orders  during thenext 12 months.   Among  the Fact Finding reports above  referred to is oneprepared, in conjunction with the shipbuilding industry, uponshipping and shipbuilding.   The Shipping  Industry desires  to record its willingness at once to  co-operate with the Board  ofTrade and Shipbuilding  Industry in an immediate considerationof the vital and urgent problem of shipbuilding  and of the actionwhich  should be  taken in regard to it.
