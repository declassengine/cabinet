THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1939.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 19  (39).CABINET.PALESTINE:  LEGAL  ARGUMENTS  LIKELY  TO BE  ADVANCED                   BY ARAB REPRESENTATIVES.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE Secretary of State for the Colonies has requested me to circulate somenotes on the legal aspects of the Arab case, dealing with the arguments likely tobe advanced by the Arab representatives during the Palestine discussions, and inparticular with the &quot; McMahon-Hussein &quot; correspondence of 1915.    2.  This memorandum is necessarily detailed, and represents much laboriousand careful research, but no decision is required upon it.  It is primarily intended for the use of the British representatives during the forthcoming discussions; butit will, I hope, emphasise once more to those of my colleagues, who may be disposed to study it,  the difficulty  which must  always confront  any  Government  of thiscountry in attempting to explain the  rival promises made  to Jews and  Arabsduring the Great War.    3.  I ought to  add  that the  &quot;Kitchener-Abdullah&quot;  and  &quot;McMahon-Hussein &quot;  correspondence to which the  attached memorandum  alludes wasexchanged in  Arabic on  both sides.  I  am  arranging for certain ambiguouspassages in the correspondence to be re-examined in the light of the Arabic texts,and  it is possible that some changes may consequently have to be  made  in thememorandum.  But I do not expect these changes  to be extensive or  important.                                                                       H.    January 23, 1939.         THE JURIDICAL  BASIS OF  THE ARAB CLAIM TO  PALESTINE.                                I. General.    It is probable that, when the Arab Delegations arrive in London for the forth-coming Palestine discussions,  they will, in addition to expounding the broaderprinciples on which they base their claim to the exclusive possession and enjoy-ment of the  whole of Palestine, maintain that this claim is unassailable on legalgrounds also.    2.   It has been suggested that, if this should prove to be the case,  the ArabDelegates should  be urged to remember that the object of the discussions is the formulation of  a  plan for  the future, and that insistence upon purely juridicalconsiderations, often of a highly contestable nature, is  not calculated to assist inthe attainment of this object; but that, if they wish to ensure that their  legal casedoes not remain unrecorded, they should  prepare a memorandum setting forththeir views upon this  aspect of the question, to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill in due course furnish a written reply.
     3.  Whether this&apos;procedure is acceptable Or not&apos;to the&quot;Arab Delegates, it isdesirable to consider  beforehand the principal legal arguments upon which theArab case is founded and the counter-arguments on each point.     4.  The Arab arguments,group themselves around two of the most important of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s declarations of policy concerning Palestine the&apos;&apos; McMahon-Hussein &quot; correspondence of 1915 and the &quot; Balfour &quot; Declarationof 1917, regarded in the light of the declared war aims of the Allies and certain provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations.                 II.- The McMahon-Hussein Correspondence.     5.  On  the  24th  October,  1915,, Sir  Henry McMahon, at  that time british high Commissioner in Egypt, gave to the Sherif of Mecca, later King Husseinof the Hejaz, the following pledge concerning the boundaries of Arab independent countries :  ...       &quot; The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria     lying to the west of  the districts of Damascus, Horns,  Hama and Aleppo     cannot be said to be purely Arab  and should be excluded  from the proposed     limits and boundaries.  With the above modification and without prejudice     to our  existing  treaties  with Arab chiefs,  we  accept  these  limits  and     boundaries,  and  in regard  to those portions  of the territories therein in     which Great Britain is  free to act without detriment to the interests of her     ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the  Government  of  Great&apos;y.    Britain to give the following assurance and  make the following reply toV    your letter :         &quot;Subject  to the above modifications, Great  Britain  is prepared to     recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories.  .   included in  the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.&quot;  ..     6.  The Arabs maintain  that the territory now called Palestine  (at thattime commonly regarded by them as part of Syria and, at any rate, not generally known or thought of as &quot;Palestine&quot;) did not lie &quot;west&quot;  of the district of damascus and was thus included, by the terms of the pledge, in the area in whichArab independence was to be recognised; and they hold that the existence of thispledge, anterior to the  Balfour  Declaration,  justifies their repudiation of that declaration and the Mandate in which it is  enshrined.     7.  The validity  of this argument depends to a large extent on  the precisemeaning of the phrase &quot; district of Damascus,&quot; in using which Sir H. McMahonmade what may  be termed a specific reservation respecting the territory to whichhis pledge was to apply. This phrase has been the subject of  endless debate, the counter-argument upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government have  consistently basedtheir case being  the result of an  examination of the Arabic version  of the corres-pondence made in 1920 by Major (now Sir Hubert) Young, who had served onthe Arab Bureau in Cairo during part of the war.  Major Young saw that theArabic of the words &quot;district  of  Damascus&quot; had the  meaning &quot;Vilayet of damascus &quot; (a vilayet being the largest class of administrative area into  whichthe Ottoman Empire was divided).  Now the vilayet of which Damascus was thecapital^) included Horns  and  Hama,  but not Aleppo, which  was the capital ofa separate vilayet of that name.  But the important point about its configurationwas that, although it extended southward to the Gulf of Akaba, it excluded all of what is now called Palestine  west of the Lake of Tiberias, the  River jordan and the  Dead Sea and all  of what is now the Lebanon or  Syria west  of the lebanon or anti-Lebanon ranges.  In other  words, most of what  is now calledPalestine lay &quot; west &quot; of  the vilayet of which Damascus was the capital.     8.  The counter-argument of His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, depends upon an interpretation of the phrase &quot; district of Damascus,&quot; whereby the western-boundary of this &apos;&apos; district&quot; was the  medial  line of the Lake of Tiberias, theRiver Jordan and the Dead Sea, the area to the west of that boundary (dividedbefore the war between the  Independent Sanjak of Jerusalem and the southern part of the Vilayet of  Beirut) being  accordingly excluded, by the words  of the pledge, from the area promised to the Arabs.    (x) See the map  at p. 19 of. the Report  of the  Royal Commission  on Palestine, 1937(Cmd. 5479).
    9.  When  the  meaning of  the  pledge  was discussed in London with the emir Feisal  (a son of the Sherif of Mecca and later King Feisal of Iraq) onthe 20th January,  1921, the above  counter-argument  was used, and the Emirpointed out that:          &quot; . . .  . if His Majesty&apos;s Government relied upon the strict interpreta-    tion of the word (vilayet) as applied to  Damascus and Aleppo they must    also interpret the word to mean the same with regard to Horns and Hama.    There was not, arid never had  been, a Vilayet of Horns or Hama.&quot;    10.  It is true that there are no Vilayets of Horns or Hama, but it is alsotrue that both  Damascus  and Aleppo are the capitals of vilayets, and as suchshould have sufficed in themselves to establish  Sir H. McMahon&apos;s meaning.  Theadditional mention of Ploms and Hama was evidently made to ensure that the intervening territory of which they  were the  most important  town should alsobe excluded from the area consigned to Arab rule,  and  obviously no reference was intended to non-existent  vilayets.  In  corroboration of this interpretationit may be remarked that there  is no apparent consistency of usage with regard tothe application of the term &apos;1 vilayet.&quot;  In one of his letters King Hussein himselfreferred to the  &quot; Vilayets of Mersina and Adana &quot; although there is no Vilayetof Mersina,  and in another letter he referred to the Vilayets of Adana andAlexandretta, while no vilayet of the latter name has ever existed.  It could,therefore, be represented  as exaggerated pedantry that  Arabs should demand from non-Arabic-speaking foreigners a strictness of expression and usage whichthey themselves  do  not observe even  in correspondence with  such foreigners.    11.  The counter-argument of His Majesty&apos;s Government was also used inthe Memorandum on British Policy  sent by Mr. Winston Churchill to the ArabDelegation, which was then in London, on the 3rd June, 1922.  In their reply,which  had evidently been prepared with  expert English legal assistance, the delegation maintained that the word  &quot;district&quot;  and not &quot;vilayet&quot; was used,&apos;and, moreover,  that the word  &quot;district&quot; and not &quot;vilayet&quot; was meant, firstly,because of the  reference to Horns and Hama  (see paragraph  9) and, secondly,because the true name of the  &quot;Vilayet of Damascus&quot; was  &quot;Vilayet of  Syria.&quot;    12.  It  is  true that the official  Turkish name  for the  vilayet of  whichDamascus was  the  capital was &quot; Vilayet of Syria,&quot;  but there should have been no  misunderstanding of the phrase, since  Turkish  usage frequently employed&quot; Sham &quot;  (Damascus) as a general appellation for Syria.  Moreover,  the writerof the letter had already found it necessary to use &quot; Syria&quot; (even though therewas a  vilayet  of that name) in order to describe  comprehensively a  vague;geographical area evidently including the Vilayets  of Syria  and  Beirut, theindependent  Sanjak of Jerusalem, the Province of the Lebanon, and part of theVilayet of Aleppo.    13.  Neither the Emir  nor the Delegation seem  to  have  pointed out  thatas the Vilayet of Aleppo extended to the Mediterranean, and so had no  area tothe west  of  it,  Sir H. McMahon could not have meant this vilayet when he spoke of the &quot;  district of Aleppo,&quot;  and  was therefore probably not thinking ofthe actual Turkish administrative areas at all.    14.  The foregoing paragraphs represent the attitude which has hitherto been consistently held  by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  on  the  subject  of theMcMahon-Hussein correspondence, and which has been given public expression.Nevertheless  it  is important  to emphasise the weak  points in His Majesty&apos;governments case,  e.g. :     (i) the fact that the word &quot; district&quot; is applied not  only to Damascus, &amp;c,           where the reading of vilayet is at least arguable, but also immediately           previously to Mersina and Alexandretta.  No vilayets of these names           exist, and in spite of what has been said in paragraph 10 it would be           difficult  to argue that the word &quot; districts &quot; can  have two  completely           different meanings  in the space of a few lines.    (ii) the fact that Horns and Hama were not the capitals  of  vilayets, but were           both  within the Vilayet of Syria.    (iii) the fact that the real title of the &quot; Vilayet of Damascus &quot; was &quot; Vilayet           of Syria.&quot;    (iv) the fact that there is  no land lying west of the  Vilayet of Aleppo.
v &apos;   15.   It may be possible to produce arguments designed to explain away someof these difficulties individually (although even this does not apply in the caseof (iv)), but it is hardly possible to explain them away collectively.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  need not on  this account abjure altogether the counter-argumentbased  on  the  meaning of  the word &quot;district,&quot; which have  been used publiclyfor many years, and the more obvious defects in which do not seem  to have beennoticed as yet by Arab critics.(?)   But it will certainly be unwise  to place anyreliance in this counter-argument.    The best explanation which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment can.give of the meaning which Sir H. McMahon meant his  pledge tobear is probably by a reference to the use of the phrase &quot; districts of Damascus,Horns, Hama and Aleppo &quot; in certain&apos;discussions which took place in 1915 betweenthe late Sir  Gilbert Clayton, Chief Political Officer at Army Headquarters  inEgypt, and Mahomed Ibn-Sherif-el-Faroki, an Arab Nationalist and former officer in the  Ottoman army.     16.   In the course of these discussions El Faroki stated that the Arabs were&apos;.&apos; at the parting of the ways,&quot; and that they would fight France for the &quot; districts of Damascus, Horns, Hama and  Aleppo.&quot;  Although the Arabs are unlikely  to admit  that anything which El  Faroki  may have said in the course  of these conversations  (of which the only record is, anyhow, derived from British sources)has any binding effect upon the Arabs generally, no Arab could argue  convincinglythat, assuming the phrase to have been used at all, El Faroki meant by it no more than the  &apos;&apos; immediate  surroundings&apos;&apos; of  Damascus,  Horns, Hama  andAleppo (which certain Arabs have maintained to be the meaning  of  the word&quot; districts &quot;  in the pledge).  On the contrary, he clearly intended it to convey abroad  definition of the Syrian hinterland,  as distinct from  the Mediterraneancoast,  this hinterland being an area vital to the schemes  of an Arab Empire orConfederation, and in this sense the &quot; districts &quot; he named were  intended  toextend from Aleppo to the Gulf of Akaba.  Moreover, El  Faroki did not includePalestine  or a &quot; district &quot; of Jerusalem among the districts for which he declaredthe Arabs would fight.  It is  thus evident that when Sir H. McMahon gave hispledge of  the 24th October, 1915, to the Sherif he adopted El Faroki&apos;s own phrasein order to assure the Sherif and the Syrian Arabs that the area for which theywere prepared to fight was assigned to them, and further  that, in using this phrase, he used it in the same comprehensive sense as El Faroki, i.e., as one whichcovered the Syrian hinterland southwards to the Gulf of Akaba.    17.  Apart from the  specific geographical reservation attached to Sir  H.McMahon&apos;s pledge of the 24th October,  1915, there is also what may be  termed ageneral reservation, since  he  stated  that Great  Britain  was only  prepared  torecognise  Arab independence         &quot; .... in regard to  those portions of  territories  therein in which    Great Britain  is free to act without detriment to the interests of her. ally,    France.&quot;    18.   If the &apos;&apos; specific &apos;&apos; reservation already expounded covers Palestine (asHis Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently maintained), then Great Britain andFrance have  sufficient legal justification for the  policy  they have pursued inPalestine the policy of assigning it to the Jewish National Home.   If, however,it be held (as is done by the Arabs) that the specific reservation does  not coverPalestine, then it is clear that Sir H. McMahon&apos;s general reservation becomes ofspecial importance.  The background  to  this  &apos;&apos; general&apos;&apos;   reservation  is  asfollows :      19.   In  1915,  after the beginning  of  the  British  naval ,attack  on theDardanelles forts, a Russian claim to the eventual possession of constantinople and the Straits was sent to Great Britain and France, and in the middle  of march the French Government informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that, for their part,they claimed  Cilicia and Syria (&quot;Syria&quot; at that time including the  whole ofPalestine  and Transjordan).  This claim was recognised and recorded in thereport which Sir M. de Bunsen&apos;s  Committee on Asiatic Turkey presented in June    (2)  See, however.  The  Arab  Awakening by Mr. George Antonius  (Hamish  Hamilton,1938), pp. 164-183, where the Arab  case is argued with much ability.
                                     Ml-1915.  It is thus evident that already at that date, and equally in October of thesame year,  His Majesty&apos;s Government  were  in fact  precluded  from assigningPalestine unreservedly to the Arabs.     20.  The Arabs may argue that the Sherif of Mecca was not aware of  theseinter-allied understandings or of the extent  of the French claim to  Syria and palestine, especially as the Sykes-Picot agreement was not concluded  until 1916or  made  public   property   (by the   Bolsheviks)   until  the  end  of   1917.Sir H- McMahon&apos;s letter of the 24th October, 1915, does not, it must be admitted,contain any description of the exact  limits and boundaries of the French claim,but this was mainly owing to. the fact that the French claim, though  recognised by His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  had  not in fact been territorially defined.   Theform of words chosen was, therefore, such as to cover the general claim made bythe French  Government, however wide it might prove to be, and the pledge wasonly to apply to those parts of Syria in  which His Majesty&apos;s Government might eventually obtain a free hand as a result of the peace settlement.     21.  It is, moreover,  clear that the Sherif of Mecca had some knowledge ofthe nature of the French  claim, since in a letter of the 1st January, 1916, hereserved the right to press at a later date a claim to &quot; what we now leave to france in Beirut and its coasts.&quot;  It is possible to argue that by this phrase  the Sherifmust have  intended to refer  to the coasts of the vilayet of Beirut, i.e., he left toFrance for the time being, subject to a subsequent claim, the whole of NorthernPalestine practically as far south as Jaffa.     22.  It can, furthermore, be argued that this aspect of the question  is noconcern  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Sir  H.  McMahon gave unequivocalexpression  to a general  reservation  in favour of the prior claim by an AlliedPower; and it might be said that had the Sherif been anxious to know  the precisenature and extent  of the French claim, it was for him to make enquiries either ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Government or the French Government. ..:   23.  Finally,  the assumption that the Sherif well understood the import ofthe French  claim  is corroborated by  the fact  that the delegation of PalestinianArabs which came to London in 1922 argued  that,  as a result of the continuedBritish occupation of the Holy Land, any obligations which Great Britain mightpreviously  have had to France with  regard to  Palestine  had expired.     24.  But, although the fact that this argument was used is a useful factor in building up the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the argument itself cannotbe reconciled with the theoretical position.  In May 1916 Great  Britain andFrance effected in the  Sykes-Picot Agreement a compromise whereby both were excluded from Palestine,  and this compromise  held good until, in 1918, France:agreed  in  effect to vary  this compromise by  accepting, for her own expectedmaterial advantage, the policy  of the Balfour Declaration.  The policy of the balfour Declaration implied the indefinite British occupation of Palestine, butthe essential French interest remained that, in return for French concurrence inthe occupation, Great  Britain should execute  and maintain this policy.     25.  It is evident, therefore, that any failure on Great Britain&apos;s part torealise this  policy  would constitute a violation of the separate pledge  concerningthe creation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine given by the French Govern-ment to the Zionists on the  14th February, 1918, and a departure from Frenchpolicy in Palestine as envisaged at  that time.   A French  interest and concernin Palestine  (and in the maintenance of the Balfour  Declaration), thoughtemporarily vested in the trusteeship  of Great Britain, is,  in strict theory, as muchin existence as in 1915.  In practice it might not be expedient to use an argument which has  little relation to the  realities of  to-day, but the Arab contention that sir H.  McMahon&apos;s general reservation was not effective at any  of  the materialtime is at any rate untenable.     26.  But although the counter-arguments may be stronger  in regard to the,&quot; general &quot; reservation than in regard to the  &quot; specific  &quot;  reservation, there arepoints of weakness connected with the &quot; general &quot; reservation also.  While it istrue that the French claim to Palestine, or the French claim for an internationaladministration of Palestine;, was only withdrawn after the acceptance of the balfour Declaration by the Allies, this  does not alter the  fact that it was His
Majesty&apos;s  Government who initiated  that  Declaration, and thus assumed an obligation which bears no relation to the French claims and which, unless Sir H.McMahon&apos;s  &quot; specific &quot;  reservation  can be  held  to  be entirely valid,  wasincompatible, and quite unjustifiably so, with their pledge to the Sherif of Mecca.The policy of  the Balfour  Declaration was not essential to  the satisfaction  ofFrench claims in this region. On the other hand, these claims were not necessarilyincompatible with Palestine remaining an Arab State, and they were, therefore, inno way contrary per se to Sir H. MacMahon&apos;s pledge to the Arabs.  In short, the&quot;general&quot; reservation has little,  if  any, validity apart  from the &quot;specific&quot;reservation.    27.  Finally, the &quot; general &quot; reservation is seriously prejudiced by a mistakein translation.  Sir H.  McMahon  no  doubt meant to  say that Great britain could only promise Arab independence in areas where she was free to act without detriment to her Ally, France,  even if these areas  were found in some cases toimpinge upon the area otherwise left open to Arab independence by the &quot; specific &quot;reservation.  But Major Young  discovered,  in the course of  his examination  ofthe correspondence which has  already been  mentioned,  that  what  was  actuallysaid in the text sent to the Sherif was :          &quot; We accept  those limits  and boundaries, and in regard to  the areas    (or provinces)  which those  boundaries  enclose, where (or  whereas) Great    Britain is free  to act without affecting the interests (or policy) of  her ally    France, I am empowered,&quot; &amp;c.    28.  This careless translation completely changes the meaning of the reserva-tion, or at any rate makes  the  meaning exceedingly ambiguous,  and it entitled the Sherif  to think that within the area restricted by the &quot; specific&quot; reservation,His  Majesty&apos;s Government  were free  to act  without reference to the FrenchGovernment.(3)  It also helps to explain the difficulty which the Sherif and hisson Feisal had later on in comprehending the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in 1919 and 1920 towards French designs on Damascus.    29.  It will, therefore, be  seen  that there are points of serious weakness inHis Majesty&apos;s  Government^ case.   In fact,  in many respects, the best that can&apos;be done is to maintain that, in considering an agreement contained  in so loosely-worded inconclusive and incomplete a series of letters as the McMahon-Husseincorrespondence, His Majesty&apos;s  Government are entitled  to  take their own inter-pretation  and  their  own avowed intentions  into account, wherever the meaning of the text is ambiguous, at least as much as the interpretation and the avowedintentions of the other side.    30.  It may be mentioned (although it is not evidence) that Sir M.  McMahonhas on two subsequent occasions explained his intentions  when he made his pledgeon behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government  to the Sherif  of  Mecca, (a)  once  in aprivate letter to Sir J. Shuckburgh of the  12th March, 1922, and (b) again ina letter to  The Times of the 23rd July, 1937.  He has stated that&apos;:          &quot; It was not intended by  me  in giving this pledge to King Hussein to     include Palestine  in the area in which Arab independence was promised.         &quot;I also had every reason to believe at  the time  that the  fact  that     Palestine was not included in my pledge was well-known to King Hussein.&quot;                      III. The &apos;&apos; Balfour &apos;&apos; Declaration.     31./, The Arab juridical claim to Palestine  is  founded not only,  positively,upon their interpretation of the McMahon pledge of 1915, but, also, negatively,on  the repudiation of  the  Balfour  Declaration of   1917.  Attempts  havecontinually been made to prove that the policy of the Jewish National Home is at variance with various Allied declarations made both during the course of the warand subsequently in the Covenant of  the  League of Nations.  The followingconstitute the most important arguments urged by Arab  advocates&apos; against the balfour Declaration :      (s) Mr. Antonius (see footnote (&apos;)) quotes a version of the pledge based oh the Arabic textsent to the Sherif, but does not, nevertheless, seem to draw the full conclusions as to the  limits which it placed upon the area in which French claims had to be cpnsulted.
    32.  The Arab Parliamentary Congress which held meetings in Cairo during october 1938, in its resolutions regarding Palestine, gave as its first reason forthe alleged invalidity of the Balfour Declaration          &quot; That it  is a transgression on the rights of the Arabs who won their    independence as a result of their alliance with Great Britain and their joint    victory in the  war, and because of the fact that the  said  declaration was    made by one who had no right to make it. Purther,  if Great Britain had not    pledged itself to support and guarantee Arab independence, the Arabs would    have never waged war against their Sultain and Khalifa,  nor would  they    have shed  their blood in overthrowing the Ottoman Empire  to be ultimately    placed under the domination of the Jews.&quot;    33.  This  can  scarcely be termed  a legal argument, but it has considerableemotional force, and in view of its origin merits consideration.   The contentionfalls into three parts :     (i) Regarding  the &quot; joint victory,&quot; the Arabs forget that this  victory was           won very  largely as a result of  British subsidies, foodstuffs, rifles,           ammunition and other armaments, and of British leadership, and that           the present position of the Arab world as a whole is mainly due to the           sacrifices of the Allied and  Associated Powers in the war.    (ii) The phrase denying Lord Balfour&apos;s  &quot; right to make the Declaration &quot; is           incorrect,  so  far as legal  obstacles  are concerned,  in view of  the           reservations expressed  in the McMahon letter  of the 24th October,           1915 (vide paragraphs 5 to 30).   (iii) Had the Arabs not waged war against their Sultan and Khalifa, and           had the  Central Powers been victorious, it is not likely that the Arab           lands would now be enjoying a greater measure of freedom than before           the war, and extremely improbable that most of them  would now have           become,  or be about to become, independent States.  There is even some           reason to think that, if the Balfour  Declaration  had not been made           when it was,  the German  Government might have persuaded  the           Turkish Government to make a similar announcement themselves.    34.  The Arabs also claim that the Balfour Declaration is incompatible withthat one of the &quot; fourteen points &quot;  laid down by President  Wilson in January1918 which includes the words :          &quot; The  Turkish  portions of  the present  Ottoman  Empire should be    assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under    Turkish rule   should  be assured  an  undoubted security of life and an    absolutely unmolested  opportunity of autonomous development.&quot;    35.  It must be the object of His  Majesty&apos;s Government to  show that thereis nothing here which could reasonably be construed as incompatible with someline of development similar to that intended by the policy of the Jewish national home.  If the Arabs  maintain that the phrase in question does not cover such apolicy, it must be remembered that the Balfour Declaration was  anterior  to the much vaguer and more general &quot; fourteen  points,&quot; and not only was its  textsubmitted to the author of  the  &quot; fourteen  points,&quot;  but on its publication it received the endorsement of the Governments of Great  Britain,. France and theUnited States.    36.  The Arabs also claim that the Balfour Declaration is  nullified by theAnglo-French Declaration of the  7th  November, 1918,  in which it was  statedthat:         &quot; The object aimed at by France and Great  Britain ....  is the com-    plete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks,    and the establishment of national Governments and Administrations deriving &quot;&apos;- their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous popula-    tions.  In order to carry out these intentions France and Great Britain are at   : one in&apos; encouraging and assisting  the establishment of indigenous Govern-    ments and Administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia.&quot;    37. &quot;This again is a general pronouncement, and even assuming that Syriawould necessarily have to be taken to include Palestine, must clearly be read withthe qualification necessitated by the anterior existence of the Balfour Declaration.
There is also, moreover, every reason to assume that after the lapse of more than ayear from the publication of the Balfour Declaration, the destiny envisaged bythe Allies for Palestine was known to the Arab &quot;World.  Finally, as a result ofthe Sykes-Picot Agreement  and the Balfour Declaration, the term &quot; Syria &quot; was clearly no longer intended by the Allied Powers to include Palestine.  The Sherifof Mecca&apos;s intention was, in fact, drawn to the import of the Agreement early in1918, and he at least must have well understood that in this connexion Syria nolonger bore the same geographical signification as prior to 1918.     38.  It is also part of the Arab claim that  the terms of the Covenant of theLeague  of Nations are  inconsistent with the Balfour Declaration.     39.  The Arab argument on this point relates to paragraph 4 of Article 22of the Covenant, in which it is stated :                                     -         &quot;  Certain communities formerly belonging  to the Turkish Empire have     reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations     can be provisionally recognised subject  to  the  rendering  of  administrative     advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand     alone.&apos;&apos;   ,  40.  The Arabs claim that this paragraph is violated by the terms of the balfour Declaration, in that the  institution in the  territory of one  of  thesecommunities of a National  Home for  another alien race,  which will ultimatelybecome  numerically and politically preponderant in the territory in  question,  is incompatible with a recognition of independence for that  community, since  theywill no  longer be the governing majority when independence comes to be granted.     41.  The Arabs claim, furthermore, that by reason of its inconsistency withthe terms of paragraph 4 of Article 22, the Balfour Declaration is null and  voidunder the first part  of paragraph 1 of Article  20, which  abrogates  all existing obligations  or  undertakings  between  members  of   the League  which  are inconsistent with the Covenant, while  the Mandate for Palestine, in so far as itincorporates the Baliour Declaration,  is null and void under the second part ofthe same Article 20, which obliges States Members never to enter into any other obligations inconsistent with the Covenant.                                ..     42.  This  seems to be the line of  the Arab argument.  The answer(4) is, inpart, that it does not follow that the Mandate is inconsistent  with paragraph 4of Article 22 merely because it does not altogether correspond with the only otherMandate framed thereunder, i.e., the Mandate for Syria;  and  that the questionwhether any Mandate is consistent with the  Covenant. can, in any  case, beconclusively and definitively answered by reference to the fact that  the  Councilof the League approved it.     43.  But the main  answer is summed  up by the  Royal  Commission,; whopointed out that      (a) The provisional recognition of &apos;&apos; certain communities formerly belonging           to the Turkish Empire&quot;  as independent nations  is permissive; the           words &apos; are  &quot;can be  provisionally recognised,&quot;   not   &quot;will,&quot; or           &quot; shall&quot; :                        &apos;                           &apos;     (&amp;) The penultimate paragraph of Article 22 prescribes that the degree of           authority to be exercised by the Mandatory shall be defined, at need,           by the Council of the League, and     (c)  The acceptance by the Allied Powers and the United States of the policy           of the Balfour Declaration made it clear  from the  beginning  that           Palestine would  have to be treated  differently  from Syria and Iraq,           and this difference of treatment was confirmed by the Supreme Council           in  the Treaty of  Sevres  and by  the  Council of the  League in           sanctioning the  Mandate.  (4) It  might also be said (a) that para. 1 of Article 20 only refers to obligations between theMembers of the League inter se: and (b) that the Balfour Declaration is not (or at any rate notexclusively) an obligation or under?tanding between Members of the League;  since amongst theparties to the understanding which it created  are (i) the Jewish organisations and (ii) the U.S.A.which is not a Member of the League.
    44.  In brief, it cannot be denied that it is inconsistent with the independence of the Arabs of Palestine  to make their country a National home for the Jews.But the provision Of paragraph 4 of Article 22 with regard to independence ispermissive only and it seems clear that the reason why this permissive provision was inserted was to make it clear  that a Mandate of limited duration and scopeas suggested in paragraph 4 would be valid and could not  be challenged on theground that  it conflicted with paragraph 2 of the same Article, which  contem-plates generally  a more extensive tutelage.  Paragraph 4 provided that  thisless extensive tutelage was permissible in certain cases, but left it to the  Councilto decide, when drawing up the Mandate for each community, whether, and if so to  what  extent, independence  should be  recognised.   In support  of  this interpretation His Majesty&apos;s Government can rely upon what actually happened,and upon the fact that the Allied Powers and the United States of America,as well as the League of  Nations, agreed to the Mandate for  Palestine withthe existing provisions for the Jewish National Home.                              IV.- Conclusion.    45.  It  is necessarily well-nigh  impossible  to anticipate  with completeaccuracy the arguments on which  the Arab delegates will base their juridicalclaim to Palestine.  The points discussed in the foregoing paragraphs represent,however, so far as can be traced, the main arguments hitherto advanced, includingthe resolutions passed at the recent meeting in Cairo of the Arab ParliamentaryCongress,  and  it is hoped that the observations  and counter-arguments hereinsuggested  may,  when  the  preparation  of  a&quot; counter-memorandum  becomes necessary, prove  both relevant and useful.    46.  At the  same time, it is sufficiently apparent from  the foregoing para-graphs that so far at any  rate as  the McMahon-Hussein correspondence is con-cerned, the  counter-memorandum  is likely to  be dependent  on a forced line ofreasoning,  and that the case of His  Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to this correspondence lacks that  self-evident and decisive clarity which ought  to formthe basis of important international acts.  Nothing, in fact,  that can be  brought forward by way  of explanation of Sir H.  McMahon&apos;s pledge is likely to enable his Majesty&apos;s  Government to convince the world at large that the  Royal Corn-mission were wrong when  they said :          &quot;It was in the highest degree unfortunate that,  in the exigencies of war,    the British  Government  was unable  to make their intention clear to the    Sherif.&quot;    47.  The position with regard to the declared war aims of the Allies ispossibly stronger, if the wording  of their declaration is taken into account inrelation to the situation already existing in regard to Palestine when they weremade. But the Arabs are not likely to be mainly or even primarily interested inthe juridical aspects of this  question, and the general  tenour of their case islikely to be that the Balfour Declaration is inconsistent with the whole spirit inwhich the Allies  declared that the war was being waged.
