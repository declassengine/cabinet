    (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.                                                        COPY NO. ^K&quot;&quot;CP. 26(^9) .                             CABINET            PAY FOR WHOLE-TIME SERVICE OF NATIONAL SERVICE VOLUNTEERS                            IN TIME OF WAR.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.     1.   On the 20th December in the House of Commons I stated inreply to a question raised in the course of debate on the Government&apos;sproposals for National Service:-         &quot;Information will be supplied to intending volunteers     regarding the terms of their employment in civil defence,     whether part-time service or whole-time service.    That     information must certainly be supplied, and will be     supplied,before the recruiting effort which we intend     to undertake begins towards the end of next month&quot;.     2.   I have since been in communication with the Trades UnionCongress General Council and have had some informal and tentativediscussion with their representatives on .the issues involved.I have promised that an announcement, already overdue, shall nowbe made at the earliest possible moment.    3.    The present note is confined to the question of the rateof pay for volunteers serving whole-time in Civil Defence in timeof war.    The other major question outstanding relates to compensationfor injury sustained in the course of peace time training, and my proposals for dealing with this will be submitted for separate consideration very shortly.
wo     4.   In the case of one branch of civil defence - the PoliceWar Reserve - conditions of service have already been settled and announced.    The rate of pay fixed is 60/- a week, with a rentalallowance of 6/- a week if the man is unable to live at home.Free medical (but not dental) treatment is also to be given.   the pay of a Regular Constable is 62/- a week on appointment rising to90/- a week after twelve years.     5.   The proposal to which I would now ask my colleagues togive their assent, is that vie should adopt the rate of 60/- a week as a general rate for A.R.P. Volunteers and Auxiliary Firemen servingwhole-time in war.    We cannot, I suggest, admit a difference in value to the nation, which can be measured in terms of a shilling ortwo either way, between the various types of service to be rendered by whole-time volunteers in time of war in civil defence.     6.   It has been suggested that a rate of 60/- might attractto the services of civil defence men who would otherwise join theTerritorial Army, but it is doubtful whether these economic differencesdo in fact determine the choice of service.    It must further beremembered that civil defence is leaving clear for the Active services the younger men whom those Services most want.     The emoluments of a private serving in the TerritorialArmy may be estimated as equivalent to 47/3 a week for a single man and for a married man with one child as equivalent to 58/l a week with additional allowances for more than one child.    generally in the civil defence services we may look to have the older men withfamily responsibilities.    It must be remembered too that in theFighting Services men have prospects of higher pay on promotion.     7.   I think it may be necessary to provide for a rental allowanceon a basis other than that of a flat rate of 6/- a week for the rarecases where a man with dependants in one of the civil defence services
is called upon to serve away from home.    This is a matter which,I suggest, should be further examined.    In the meantime I proposethat I should now be authorised to announce that the rates of paycontemplated for whole-time service during war in civil defenceare 60/- a week for a man and 40/- a week for a woman.     It would be made clear that this is the Government&apos;s present intention which must be subject to any later decisions of theGovernment of the day when the occasion for whole-time servicearises.     8.   The rate of 60/- will no doubt be criticised in some quarters as offering something less to the Police War Reserve and the auxiliary Firemen than the initial pay of the Regular Constable andthe Regular Fireman, but can in my view be justified on the groundthat we must not regard civil defence as something which offers scope for employment rather than as a form of voluntary service in time ofnational emergency.     9,   It has not been possible, in the time available, to bring this memorandum to the  notice of the Chancellor of theExchequer.    His position must, therefore, be reserved.                                       J.A.27th January, 1939-
