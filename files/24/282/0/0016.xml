In. 96-aSECRET.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.)   the question what,  if any,  amendments  of the  Official Secrets Acts should   be recommended.   These  Acts are the only effective  statutory provisions   for preventing the  disclosure of Government secrets  and we  should hot be   prepared to acquiesce in any relaxation of their provisions which was   likely to reduce the general protection which they afford.   We  think,   however, that the exceptional powers of interrogation conferred  by   Section 6 of the Act of  1920 (on which recent criticism has been   concentrated) could be modified without detriment to the  interests of   the State.2.       In the Report of a Committee of  Heads of Departments  (CP.  261(38))   which we had before us,  it was suggested that if the use  of these   powers of interrogation is to be restricted,  this might be  done  by   amending legislation requiring the prior consent of a  judicial authority.   We think, however,  that  there are strong objections to  this method,  and   that a better course would be to confine the use of the special  powers   of interrogation to offences against Section 1 of the  Official Secrets   Act, 1911.         Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of 1911 draw a clear distinction   between two kinds of offences.   Section 1 makes it a  felony  to  disclose   &quot;for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state&quot;   information &quot;which is calculated to be or might be or  is  intended to be   directly or indirectly useful to an enemy&quot;.   Section 2 makes it a   misdemeanour to disclose other official secrets.   Broadly speaking,.P.  16(39)Copy No.CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACTS.1.In pursuance of Cabinet 58(38),  Conclusion 13,  we have considered
Section 1, of which the marginal note is &quot;Penalties for Spying&quot;,  relates to espionage cases, and Section 2 relates to other cases where there hasbeen a wrongful disclosure of information.      As the law already draws a distinction between these two classes ofoffence, it seems that if the use of the. special powers of interrogationis not to apply to all offences under the Official Secrets Acts,  but isto be limited to certain types of offences, it would be expedient to basethis limitation on the distinction already drawn by the existing law.      In the public agitation about Section 6, stress has been laid onthe point that exceptional powers which are justifiable in espionage casesought not to be used in other cases, and a limitation of the powers ofinterrogation to offences against Section 1 of the Act of 1911 ought togo a long way towards satisfying the critics.      We attach the draft of a Bill which we have prepared for thispurpose.   It will be observed that it is proposed that the exercise ofthe powers of interrogation shall be subject, except in cases of specialemergency, to the permission of the Secretary of State.   To prevent toowide a use of the existing section an undertaking has been given that asregards published information the Police shall only exercise the power ofinterrogation after obtaining the consent of the Secretary of State orthe Attorney General or in Scotland the Lord Advocate.   If the powers are limited as proposed in the draft Bill to espionage cases it is arguable that the prior consent of the Secretary of State is unnecessary:but if there is no such requirement opponents may represent that one ofthe existing safeguards is being abandoned, and on the whole it seemsexpedient to insert this limitation on the use of the powers by the Police.      If it is agreed that this Section can properly be amended asproposed in the draft Bill, the question arises whether the Government1sdecision should be announced in advance of the Report of the Select
                                                                     n                                3.Committee of the House of Commons which is enquiring into theapplicability of the Official Secrets Acts to Members of the House inthe discharge of their Parliamentary duties.   In our opinion,  it would facilitate the work of the Select Committee to know that in future thepowers of interrogation will be limited to espionage cases, and itwould be advantageous to announce the Government1s decision forthwithand to introduce the Bill as soon as possible.   There is a question on the subject by Mr, Dingle Foot on the Order Paper for 1st February.      We accordingly recommend -     (a)  that the draft Bill appended to this Report should be          approved by the Cabinet in principle and referred to          the Home Affairs Committee for examination with a view          to its&quot;introduction in the House of Commons as soon as          possible j     (b)  that in answer to Mr. Dingle Foofs Question on the          1st February it should be stated that the Government          have decided to introduce legislation to amend Section 6          of the Act of 1920 and that a Bill for the purpose will          be introduced at an early date.                                              S.H.                                           Chairman                                     on behalf of the Committee.20th January, 1939.
