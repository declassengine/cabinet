THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT      Printed for the Committee  of  Imperial Defence.  January 1939.SECRET.                                                        Copy No. 109150S-B.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.SUPPLY ORGANISATION  IN WAR.   (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1382-B.)         Memorandum  by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.    THIS problem was remitted by the Committee of Imperial Defence* to aCommittee consisting of the Minister for. Co-ordination of Defence, Lord Weirand Sir Arthur Robinson, and the Report of  the Committee is in C.I.D. PaperNo. 1375-B.    (2)   The conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Report(Minutes of 309th Meeting, Conclusion 1, held on the 10th February,  1938),  was as follows :     (a)  To accept the assumption that, as far as supply organisation is concerned,.           &quot; war plans should be based on what may be termed a war of limited          liability, i.e., for example, that there will be no such expansion of the          Army and consequently of military supply as occurred in the last war,          or that, if such expansion does occur, the necessary supply arrange-          ments can be left  to be made after the  Avar has begun  by expanded          but   separate  Service  Supply  Departments.&quot;    (C.I.D.  Paper          No. 1375-B, paragraph 18.)    (b)  That early  in  1939  a special  review  should be  made and a report          rendered  to the Committee of Imperial Defence of  the progress by          the War Office and Air Ministry in their arrangements for providing          the supplies of finished munitions  and stores estimated  to be needed          for the first twelve months of war (as suggested in paragraph 17 of          the report), and that the problem of a single central supply organisa-          tion in war for such stores be further considered in the  light of that          review.    (c)  That immediate steps should be taken to lay  out the organisation  and          prepare for  the establishment of  the Ministry for the  control of          materials   and  common  services.   (C.I.D.  Paper  No.  1375-B,          paragraph 3.)    (d)  To take note  that the questions raised in the memorandum by the Minister          of Labour (C.I.D.  Paper No. 1382-B) had  been resolved by  Depart-          mental agreement,  and that the functions to. be performed in relation          to labour  should be exercised as follows :              (i)  Supply of Labo%ir by the Ministry of  National Service.           (ii)  Management  (including  questions of  employers&apos;  relations with                labour and the fixing of wages) by the Departments responsible                 for production  co-ordinated by  the  proposed  Ministry  of                 Supply with the assistance of a special Committee set up for                 the purpose on which these Departments would be represented.          (iii)  Settlement of Disputes by the Ministry of Labour.                       * C.I.D/285th Meeting, Minute 1.
           Subject to the reservation that a decision in regard to the responsi-           bility of the Ministry of Supply for the regulation of Labour Supply           (see (d) (ii) above) should be reserved pending further consideration           of this and allied problems by the Sub-Committee under the  Chair-           manship of  Sir  Ernest Gowers, recently  set up by the Mail-Power           Committee.    (e) To take note of the view of the Sub-Committee that no change is required           in the  War priority arrangements laid  down in  C.I.D.  Paper           No. 763-B.   v&quot;    (3)  The time, &quot; early in 1939,&quot; has now come for the special review  of war potential  mentioned  in  (b)  of -the  conclusion  of  the  Committee of ImperialDefence.  The reason why this special review was recommended before a decision was taken on the problem of supply organisation in war as a Whole is sufficientlyshown in the extract from the Report of the Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1375-B)which follows :          &quot; 17.   Our general conclusion is that, if time admits of the completion    of  the  present Defence Programme by the Departments,  and  if the Air    Ministry  and  War Office in that time also complete arrangements for  supply    to the extent  estimated to be needed in the first twelve months of war, it    should not be necessary to make preparations  in peace  for a single central    supply organisation for technical service stores  at the outset of war.  We    think that it will be advisable that the progress of the  two departments in    both these matters should be specially reviewed, say, early in 1939, arid that    the problem should be  further considered in the light of that review.&quot;    (4) As  regards war potential,  the position in  the  Air Ministry may  besummarised as being  that,  after allowance is made for the increased productionof aircraft either  already realised or anticipated in the near future, there will still be a considerable gap to be bridged before we arrive at the rate of productionin the first twelve months of emergency required to meet the Air Ministry wafpotential.  The  position in  the War Office is that  war potential is in sight forOne contingent,  but that advance arrangements cannot, under existing cabinet decisions, be made to provide war potential for the  whole of the laird forces nowin existence, much less for any expansion of those forces which may be requisiteunder stress of war.  Accordingly, in the case both  of the R.A.F. and the Army,it seems clear that further large measures of industrial  mobilisation will or mayhave to be taken in emergency, and this was the supply position out of which theMinistry of Munitions originated in the last war.  As regards the  Admiralty,the position, on  the present  hypothesis given to the Supply Organisation, is thatno large extension of  industrial capacity for the use of the Fleet (apart from theFleet  Air Arm) is anticipated to be needed in the first twelve months of emergency.    (5) There are  also very important labour considerations affecting the problem,and as to these, I cannot do better than append to this memorandum the relevantextract from Paper No. N.S. 99, being the final Report of the Sub-Committee  onthe Control of Man Power.  1 may perhaps recall that when the Second reading of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, was moved in the House of Lords,  it was described  as a &quot; measure to organise  the skilled labour of the country for theproduction of munitions of war.&quot;  The Ministry of Munitions in fact originatedas much in labour difficulties as in supply difficulties.    (6) It has been common ground throughout the lengthy discussions of this problem on the  Supply  Organisation that if responsibility for  the supply  of finished war stores guns or motor vehicles or aircraft is to be centralised in oneMinistry  in  War, then that supply  (and  also the  corresponding design and inspection)  must  be centralised  in the  Ministry  already approved  by  theCommittee of Imperial Defence, namely, a Ministry for the control of materials and common services, which would thus become a Ministry of Supply in the fullsense of the word.  The position in  regard to the Ministry already approved isthat detailed  plans for its lay out and the exercise of its  functions are in hand,and that provision for it as an approved  war ministry is being made as part ofthe scheme for  accommodating and locating Government  Departments in  war.This  last point is  a cogent reason for taking a decision  whether the scope of theMinistry is to be restricted  to control and supply of raw materials or whether itis to be extended into the field  of  supply of finished stores.
ENCLOSURE.EXTRACT FROM PAPER No. N.S. 99 (ALSO PAPER No. N.S. (CM.) 29.)        Final Report of the Sub-Committee on the Control of Man-Power.         it-          ^fe                                   ^           -Vr         -7V-          &quot;Vv           *YV           TV&quot;           &quot;71*           &apos;A*Allocation of man-power dilution of labour.     14.   It will be for the Ministry of  National  Service, subject,  of course, to cabinet decision,  to settle questions arising from  competing demands for man-power between the armed forces and industrial employment.  But some authority must also adjudicate on competing demands within the industrial field.  Somehowor other demands must be ranked  on a  scale of priority, so that an insufficientlabour force may be directed where it is most needed.  No doubt, also;  sooner or later, the available labour supply will have to  be  augmented by &quot; dilution.&quot;Here a difficulty  arises which applies  also to the next  section of  this Report,relating to wages and disputes.   In the plans for dealing with these subjectsthe existence of a full Ministry of Supply, responsible for almost all productionof war material, has hitherto been assumed, and it plays a vital part in them.Eor  instance,  the Ministry of  Supply,  if there is one, is the obvious  authorityto determine  intra-industrial priorities.   Again,  if  the Ministry  of  NationalService decides that the time has come for some men to be released from industry for the armed forces, and their  places filled by  dilution, a Ministry of Supply     (7) It has further been common ground in the discussions of the problem inthe Supply Organisation that, if the responsibility for supply of finished storesis transferred in war to a single Ministry, the transfer should be confined tothose finished stores where questions of  reorientation  of industry arise as,e.g., munitions properly  so-called or aircraft and that the responsibility should remain with the Service Departments for what  may  be summarily  defined asquartermaster-general stores, as, e.g., the uniforms and the boots and the groceries.If all this latter work should  be transferred, it has been apprehended  that theresult may be to create an organisation so cumbrous  that it would be difficult to run successfully .as  one  unit of administration.   It may  be  necessary to give further consideration to this aspect of the problem, as the plans for institutingwar controls of  such materials as wool and leather are developed, but I do notthink this need delay a decision now on the main issue.     (8) As to that issue, we are all aware of the strong pressure which has beenbrought to bear  in Parliament and in the Press to set  up a Ministry of supply in peace.   We may,  I submit, expect that pressure to be  so strong in emergencythat we cannot  resist it.  We are all aware of the difficulties which have ledus to defer decision on the question in  the past.     (9) I  should myself summarise the position  in this way.  An  immediate decision ought to be taken.   Public  opinion will compel us to set up a Ministryof Supply in the full sense in emergency.   We must, therefore, make all prepara-tions for  it in peace which the time  now at our  disposal permits.  Those whohave to make these  preparations must have instructions as to the  scope of theMinistry Otherwise they will largely waste their time.  These instructions shouldbe that the plans for the Ministry of Control and Supply already  approved bythe Committee of Imperial Defence should be enlarged,  so that it shall be ableto undertake also responsibility for the supply of finished stores in emergency,either  (a) for all three  Service Departments,  or  (b)  for  only the  War Office&quot;and Ait Ministry.  The  decision as between (a) and (b) can be deferred till theactual onset of emergency.                                              (Initialled)       f.  W. H. I.

would  be  the  natural  authority to decide where  they  were to come from and how they  were to be substituted,  and to force employers to comply.   If thereis to be no full Ministry of Supply,  this duty can only  be  performed by someco-ordinating committee of the three  Services, and that is open to difficulties ofwhich mention is made below.Wages and disputes.    15.  This question, as well as that dealt with in the preceding paragraph, hasrecently been  reported  on by a Sub-Committee charged with the duty of con-sidering the respective functions of the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of  NationalService and Ministry of Supply in these&apos; matters.   The conclusion was that theMinistry of National Service does not come  into this part of the picture;  thatthe departmental responsibility for regulating wages in controlled establishmentsmust rest with the Ministry of Supply, and  in other great industries  (e.g., coal and transport) with the appropriate Government Department, using  as  far as.possible the ordinary conciliation machinery;  that the Ministry of Labour would act in the first place as informal advisers of these Departments, and in the second place exercise functions of  conciliation and  arbitration similar to those whichthey exercise to-day;  and that it might prove necessary to take statutory powerto impose wage rates and prohibit strikes, but it was better not to attempt to makeany plans for this in advance.    16.  In the  matter of  wage  rates  there  are two dangers to  be  guarded against : One is that an increase in the cost of living or other general factors mayforce  a general rise of wages.   The other  is  that,  for  motives of immediateexpediency, increases of wages may be given  to particular classes of workers, orin particular industries, which cannot be kept from spreading.  The first can onlybe guarded against by keeping down the cost of living, limiting profits, and having a strong central wages tribunal which commands  general confidence.  The vitalimportance in this connexion of finding some effective means of limiting prices and profits has already been stressed in other Reports, but we wish once more toemphasise the point.   Control over wages is  impossible without it.  The  seconddanger will be a serious one, because  the check ordinarily imposed on employersby their need to maintain competitive  prices in their export markets will be gone.Something will have to take its place.  We had looked to the Ministry of supply to furnish this  check  by means of contract  prices which left no profit  if any increase of wages was given except with their approval.  If there is no  Ministryof Supply, the only effective  check can be for the Service Departments to perform the same function in the same way, acting under the advice of their Co-co-ordinating committee.    But in all these matters in determining  priorities of demands for labour, indilution and in wages control this  expedient  is a very different matter fromrelying on a single Ministry of Supply responsible generally for production.  even within a single Ministry, as the last war showed, the battles between the LabourBranch and the Production  Branch over these matters were acute enough.  Ifthere is no Ministry of Supply, they will be the subject of conflict between threeLabour Branches  and  three  Production Branches of three Departments,  them-selves in conflict with one another.  A Department responsible for the productionof what is needed by its particular fighting  arm,  but not directly for  the needsof others, cannot take the same balanced view as  a Department responsible forall.  Acutely conscious of the need for something for which it is departmentallyresponsible, such a Department will no&apos; find  it easy to carry out whole-heartedlya decision of a co-ordinating Committee on Priorities that a reluctant  employermust be forced to delay delivery by introducing dilution or that a strike must berisked by refusing an advance of wages.    17.  We recognise, of course, that the decision  whether there should or shouldnot be a full Ministry  of Supply involves questions outside our purview, and wedo not presume to be competent judges of it.  But we should be doing less than our duty if we failed  to point out the grave consequences that would follow inthe field  of  control of labour if there were not an Executive Department.responsible generally for the purchase and manufacture of war supplies.        *           *          *          *           *      &quot;    *

Copy  No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 34:5th Meeting, held on                       January 26, 1939.                (1)-SUPPLY  ORGANISATION IN WAR.                         (C.I.D. Paper No. 1505-B.)     (Previous reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 309th Meeting, Minute 1.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence on  Supply Organisation in War (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 1505-B).    SIR THOMAS INSKIP asked the Committee to bear in mind that, as statedin paragraph 6 of the memorandum, preparations for the establishment of aMinistry for the Control of Materials and Common Services had already begun.At its  309th Meeting* held in February 1938, the Committee of Imperial defence had decided that &quot; early in 1939  a special review should be made &quot; of the progressachieved by the War Office and Air Ministry towards providing war potentialfor their munitions requirements for the first twelve months of war. This reviewhad been made and the result was set out in paragraph 4 of the memorandum.The Air Ministry were faced with &apos;&apos; a considerable gap &quot; which must be bridgedbefore  they reached the rate of production in the first twelve months of emergencyrequired to meet  their war potential.  Similarly the War Office had only beenable  to develop war potential  for one contingent.   Under  existing cabinet decisions advance arrangements  could not be made to provide war potential  forthe whole of the land forces now in existence, much less for any expansion.  Asregards the Admiralty, on the present hypothesis given to the Supply Board, no material increase in existing capacity would be required in the first year of war.As stated in paragraph 9 of his memorandum, a decision was urgently requiredso as to enable plans for the establishment,  in  time of war, of a Ministry ofSupply, to be prepared  forthwith.  The  decision as to whether the ministry should embrace all three Service Departments,  or  only  the War Office and  theAir Ministry, could be left till the  onset of an emergency.    Continuing, SIR THOMAS INSKIP referred to  the plans for  the accom-modation  of Government Departments in war which was a matter of extreme urgency, and materially affected by the form which our War Supply organisation would  take.  It would be extremely difficult to evolve the necessary arrangementsquickly in emergency.  Hence no time should be lost in arriving at a decisionon the proposals before the Committee.  He would like to call attention  to  the considerations outlined by Sir  Ernest  Gowers  in  the  final report of the Sub-Committee on the Control of Man-Power given in the enclosure to  the memo-randum; these indicated  the importance of a Ministry of Supply from the pointof view of the control of man-power and of labour.  Finally, the Committee should realise that it was not proposed  to bring what are commonly known as quarter-master-general stores, e.g., uniforms, boots, &amp;c.,  within  the orbit of the Ministryof Supply.               * C.I.D. 309th Meeting, Conclusion 1 (6).[18556-1]B
    MR. HORE-BELISHA said  that  this was a most important paper, the implications of which needed careful consideration.  He  invited attention to theassumption governing the previous  Conclusions of the  Committee of ImperialDefence  on Supply Organisation in War given in paragraph  2* of the memo-randum,  as follows :    &quot; (a)  To accept the assumption that, as far as supply organisation is concerned,           &apos; war plans should be based on what may be termed a war of limited           liability, i.e., for example, that there will be no such expansion of the           Army and consequently  of military supply  as occurred in the last           war, or that,  if such - expansion does  occur, the necessary supply           arrangements  can  be left to be made after  the  war  has  begun by           expanded but separate  Service Supply Departments.&apos;   (C.I.D.  Paper           No. 1375-B, paragraph 18.) &quot;It was now clear that if we became: involved in war,  it would be a struggle forour very existence and not a war in which we could limit our liability.   For thisreason he  felt  that  this  assumption  should be referred to  the Cabinet forreconsideration.  Indeed,  the  assumption  was destroyed by  the sentence inparagraph 4 of the memorandum,  which read as. follows :        &quot;  It seems clear that further large measures  of  industrial mobilisation    will or may have to be taken in emergency, and this  was  the supply position    out of which the Ministry of Munitions originated in the last war.&quot;The impact of the next war would be so overwhelming,  that if the Ministry ofSupply was not already in being at the outset, and staffed with personnel whohad gained experience in  peace, there was a danger that the war would be lostbefore the organisation  could be  set  up.  Consequently,  he  himself  stronglyadvocated the  institution of a Ministry of Supply at the earliest possible moment in peace.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the question  before the Committee was whether we should now initiate preparations for the establishment of a Ministryof Supply  in time of war.  Consideration of the wider question of establishingsuch a Ministry in peace was quite a different matter.    MR.  HORE-BELISPIA  said  that  the  proposal  before  the Committeepostponed  a decision on the inclusion of the Admiralty.  He submitted that wecould not afford to defer any decisions whatsoever.&apos;    SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the Committee would note that alterna-tive plans  were  to be made,  one  of which would cover the  inclusion of theAdmiralty, and the other its exclusion.  Hence no difficulty  should arise what-ever the ultimate decision might be.    LORD HALIFAX strongly supported the  Secretary of State for War.  Fora long time he had tried to think that a war  of limited liability was possible,but he was now convinced  that we  must abandon  such  a conception.  He wasworried  by one  aspect of the matter,  with  which the Committee  were notunfamiliar, namely, the attitude of the  French towards the land contribution tobe made  by Great Britain.  It appeared from  the memorandum that we shouldbe incapable of making a useful  contribution, unless we pressed on  with our preparations  and  increased our  industrial capacity.   On  general  principle,therefore, he thought it right that  we should extend our industrial arrangementsso that we could equip larger forces if required.  Such preparations would tendto hold the French steady.    MR. BROWN pointed out that it was estimated that  only thirty-five per cent.of the capacity of  the membership of the Engineer  Employers Federation wasbeing used for armament  purposes.    SIR CYRIL NEWALL  suggested  that the question of land contribution.to be made might more suitably be dealt with by the Committee, when the Chiefscof Staff  report on the &quot;Preparedness of the Army for  its role  in War&quot; came!up for consideration.  This report  had been completed by the Chiefs of staff the previous day.      .....           * C.I.D. 309th Meeting, Conclusion 1 (a).
SIR THOMAS INSKIP concurred.    MR. HORE-BELISHA agreed with the Foreign Secretary that our industrial capacity must be increased.   Only last week he had to reject a Belgian request for some 3 - 7 A.A.  guns.  The limited role of the Army only covered  a  small part of industry and we should take a broad view in regard to industry as awhole. The Minister of Labour &quot;had said that only 35 per cent, of the engineeringcapacity of the country was being used.  He considered that we should use agreater proportion for war  production now in peace.    MR. BROWN agreed.  He said that he had been an advocate of the Ministryof Supply in peace  for  some time the sooner it was set up the better.    MR.  HORE-BELISHA pointed out that owing  to  the  assumption of awar of &quot;limited liability&quot; we were not  making sufficient use of our industrial capacity in peace, nor had we any authority to do so.    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD agreed and said that that was all the more reasonfor pressing on with the preparations suggested by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.   The question of the  institution of a Ministry of Supply in  pea,cecould thereafter  be taken up at once.    MR. OLIVER  STANLEY  said that two months  ago, he had argued  infavour of a Ministry of Supply, but there had been no such unanimity  in itsfavour as was  now evident.  He doubted whether it was possible to extend our preparations under the existing system.  The Board of Trade had been made responsible  for making plans  for the  Ministry of  Materials and  common services.  If  these plans were  to be extended to include munitions, &amp;c,  thenecessary  machinery for making them was not available in the Board of Trade,and he considered that  a separate Department would have to  be set up for thispurpose.  He had enlisted the help of people from the trade in the preparation ofschemes for control in war, but matters were made very difficult by the fact that theycould not be given  any assurance that they would carry out this work in war.Consequently, he strongly advocated the appointment of a Minister of Supply inpeace  who would be responsible for planning.   He added that in his view  aMinistry  of  Supply  would have  to  be  responsible for what had  been termedquartermaster-general stores, in view of the possibility of a shortage of rawmaterials, such as wool and leather.     SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON, in reply to Mr. Stanley, said that if, after full consideration of the arguments for and against, a Ministry of Supply were set up in peace, the  position would Obviously be much easier  at the beginningof a war.  The Cabinet had, however, decided that  such  a Ministry should notbe set up  in peace,  and the memorandum before the Committee had been draftedon the basis of that  decision.     SIR  KINGSLEY  WOOD  felt that the present proposals should proceedand the wider issue of a Ministry of Supply in peace be reviewed by the Cabinetimmediately.     SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that, if that was the opinion of the Committee,it should be reported to  the Cabinet the following Wednesday.  He would give theCabinet full details of the various points made by Members of the Committee.     MR. ITORE-BELISITA drew attention to the very powerful sentence withwhich the Final &quot;Report of the Sub-Committee on the Control of  Man-Power(Enclosure to the Memorandum) concluded, viz :        *           *           *            *           *           *         &quot; But we should be doing less than our duty if we failed to point out the     grave consequences that would follow in the field of control of labour if there     were not an executive department responsible generally for the purchase and     manufacture of war supplies.&quot;       /    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD recalled that the real difficulty in deciding whethera Minister of Supply should be appointed in peace had been the question of the
powers with which he should be armed.  Should he, for instance, have compulsory powers over labour?   The Cabinet had  thought that on balance  such  powers might create more disturbance than advantage.  The circumstances now, however,were different to those obtaining when the Cabinet reached its decision, and it waspossible that, in the present state of public opinion, the reactions of Labour mightbe very different.    MR. BROWN thought that the Labour difficulties had  been exaggerated. he felt that we should press on with a Ministry of Supply to mobilise  the availableindustrial capacity of the country.   In his  opinion, this could be done withoutcompulsory powers.    MR. STANLEY said that he had always held this view. At the outset  of anemergency, there would be an ugly gap while  Parliament was meeting and passing the necessary legislation  for a Ministry of Supply, and while the Ministry wasbeing instituted.  Until legislation was passed they could not even make appoint-ments to positions in the Ministry.    MR. BROWN was anxious that the proposals for a Ministry of Supply shouldnot be side-tracked on the question of compulsory powers over labour.    LORD  HALIFAX  said  that  he was  not at present able to come  downdefinitely on the side of a Ministry, of Supply, but he was struck by the realisationthat in  these times it was necessary to think on wider lines than a few  months before.  Similar issues arose in regard to  the A.A. defences of Malta, Aden and gibraltar  to be discussed later in the meeting.* He had not the necessary know-ledge to suggest the best way of tackling the problem, but was in no doubt as to thenecessity for an early decision.    MR. HORE-BELISHA suggested that  the question  of compulsory powerswas a detail.  What was required was an individual in peace who could give hiswhole mind to the necessary preparations  and organisation of Supply.  He.drew the attention of the Committee to a sentence in paragraph 9 of the memorandum,viz. :                                                             -.&apos; : &quot;.;--/:        &apos;&apos; Public opinion- will compel us  to set up a Ministry  of Supply in the    full sense in emergency.&quot;This was  absolutely true.  In every emergency the  public said &quot; Where is theMinistry of Supply? &quot;    MR. BROWN pointed out that a Ministry of Supply would simplify labourproblems as there would be one demand for labour instead of three as at present.    MR. MACDONALD said that he could  not at this  stage commit himself  inthe matter, but he had been very strongly impressed by the arguments put forward that morning.  If the views expressed were as weighty as he  thought, Cabinetconsideration was a matter of urgency.   He asked whether Sir Thomas Inskipcould prepare  a  Paper  with a view to  obtaining a Cabinet  decision  nextWednesday.    Discussion ensued as to the quickest method of obtaining a Cabinet decisionon the question of the setting up in peace of  a Ministry of Supply;  It was agreedthat the Minutes of the discussion should  be sent  forward  at once to the Cabinet,and that,  in addition, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should circulate a paper to the Cabinet.    MR.  STANLEY suggested  that the Memorandum  should emphasise thedifficulty of the transition from peace machinery controlled by several departments to war  machinery controlled by one.     SIR  ARTHUR ROBINSON said that one of the  points for early decision was the location of the Ministry of Supply in war.  It was far more difficult toreach such a decision for an organisation which would only be set up in emergency.It  was obvious that, if the Ministry  were instituted in peace, the necessary arrangements would  be greatly simplified.                                * See Micute 5.-
CONCLUSIONS.     THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed :-     (a)  That the Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence on.           Supply Organisation in War (C.I.D. Paper No. 1505-B) together with           the above Minutes, should be submitted to the Cabinet for early con-           sideration,  with the following  recommendations :            (i)  That  it would be necessary  to set up a Ministry of Supply in the                  full  sense, in a major war.           (ii)  That  the plans now being prepared for the establishment in time                  of war of a Ministry for the Control of Materials and Common                  Services    (vide  OLD.   Minutes  of  the   309th   Meeting,                  Minute 1 (c)) should  be enlarged so that this Ministry shall be                  able  also  to  undertake  the responsibility for  the supply of                  finished  stores,  (a)  for all three Service Departments, (b)  for                  only the  War Office and Air Ministry.          (iii) That  a  decision as to whether (a) all three Service Departments or                  (b) only the War Office and  Air Ministry should be included in                  the  orbit  of the  proposed Ministry of  Supply,  should  be                  deferred  until  a  decision is taken to  set  up a  Ministry of                  Supply, either in peace or war.     (6)  That the Minister for Co-ordination of  Defence  should also submit a           Memorandum to the Cabinet for consideration as early as possible :            (i)  drawing  attention to  the  views expressed  by members of  the                  Committee of Imperial Defence on the question of setting up a                  Ministry of Supply in time of peace;           (ii)  pointing  out  that the assumption*  on which   the Committee of                  Imperial Defence based their previous conclusions in February                  1938, on  the question of Supply Organisation in War appeared                  to  require further consideration in present circumstances;          (iii) inviting the Cabinet to give further  consideration, in the light of                  (i) and (ii) above, to  their previous decisiont on  the question                  of  setting  up a Ministry of Supply in time  of peace.    * &quot; (a) To accept the assumption  that, as far as supply organisation is concerned, &apos; warplans should be based on what may be termed a  war of limited liability,  i.e., for example,  thatthere will be no such expansion of the Army and consequently of military supply as occured inthe last war, or that, if such expansion does occur, the necessary supply arrangements can beleft to be made  after the war  has begun by  expanded but separate Service  Supply Depart-ments &apos; (C.I.D. Paper No. 1375-B, para. 18).&quot;  (C.I.D. 309th Meeting, Minute 1 (a)).    f                           Cabinet  51 (38) 2.    &quot; (a)  To confirm the view  expressed at the previous  discussion  that, in present circum-stances, the setting up of a Ministry of  Supply with compulsory powers was undesirable.    (b) That the establishment of a Ministry of  Supply without compulsory powers was  alsoundesirable.    (c) That the proposal for the appointment of an additional Minister  to assist the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence should not be further pursued.&quot;         ^           ^G-            %r            %r           -SfcRichmond Terrace, S.W. 1,     January 26, 1939.
