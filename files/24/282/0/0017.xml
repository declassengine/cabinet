WAR RISKS .(COMPENSATION AND INSURANCE. )                Memorandum by the Chancellor                     of the  Exchequer.            1.     It will be necessary so soon as the House reassembles            to  make  a comprehensive statement  regarding the Governments            plans fur dealing with loss arising from  damage caused, by            enemy action in  the event of war,  and the methods which they            have in  mind for compensation or insurance in respect of the            various  risks.                  Previous  answers in the House have dealt with one            aspect of the question -- damage caused to fixed &quot;property            (see Appendix I. )   But I have undertaken, in reply to            Questions and also in correspondence with important            individuals and  representative bodies, to make a further state-            ment on  this aspect of the subject as soon as possible.    And            I have promised  also tc indicate the Governments intentions            as  toe onpensation in respect of death or injury of civilians.                  There are two other very important categories of            damage to property to be dealt with - damage to essential            goods and to merchant shipping,-.    Both of these subjects have            been under consideration by the Departments concerned,  and the            conclusion has been reached that they could and should be            dealt with by the method of insurance, i,e.  by a scheme            under which,  in  return for a premium,  the Government under-            takes to meet the loss0            2.     It may be asked why,  if a system of Government            insurance can be devised for merchant shipping and their
cargoes  and for essential stools when landed in this country,the same method cannot be applied to the risk of damage hyair bombardment to buildings and their contents,.    the answer is in the Report of the Phillips Committee (C. I. L\Paper No. 11+67-B of 18th August, 1938) which, was discussed and approved by the Cabinet on 19th October (Cabineth9 (38) Conch^acu13)o   See especially the reasons in paragraph h of that report where the Committee felt compelled to reject the ideaof an insurance scheme to cover the enormous and indeedimmeasurable risk of war damage to property on land asimpracticable.,   On the other hand, an adequate and continuoussupply of essential or even possible goods and the maintenance in operation of the Merchant Navy are absolutely vital to thecountry1s capacity to carry on war at all.   It will not be equally essential in a great many cases to repair or replacedamaged buildings until the war is over.    Essential goods,therefore, and shipping rank higher in priority for fulland immediate payment in respect cf loss than other propertyon land.   Moreover, while the individual building owner may find it altogether impossible to pay a really adequatepremium there is no such difficulty in cases where the premium can be added to the sale price of goods.   The total value of property insured against fire in this country isabout  10,000 millions.    It is not possible by collecting anypremium which would seem reasonable to build up an adequatefund.    Persons whose property is damaged are entitled to suchfair compensation as the State can pay, but in view of the enormous expense and destruction of war such compensationmust be settled in the light of the circumstances in which thecountry finds itself after the war and cannot be promised at100-$ in advance.3.     The scheme for reinsuring against King&apos;s Enemy risks(a) United Kingdom ships and (b) cargoes consigned to and
from the United Kingdom, has been worked out hy the Board ofTrade  and  a  short statement in regard to it, suitable for inclusion  in the comprehensive announcement to be made inParliament,  is to be found in Appendix II&quot;h&quot;     The scheme for insurance of essential goods againstwar risks  on land involves many difficulties and thefollowing  paragraphs give an account of the matter sufficientto enable  the Cabinet to reach the essential decisions.Previous consideration  of the matter.5&quot;     As pointed out in paragraph 2 above, a decision thatproperty in  general, particularly buildings, cannot hecovered by State insurance and should be covered by a g.c.m.g.-pens ation scheme does not necessarily apply to essential goods.    The buildings  are there anyhow, while in the absenceof cover, the goods may not be there.    While there are obvious difficulties in giving more favourable treatment to goods than to buildings the overriding interests ofthe State may well require that whatever can or cannotbe done in connection with buildings, such arrangements should be made as will  ensure the supply of essential goods as well as the maintenance of the export tradesThe Committee were originally informed that as regardsraw or semi-finished materials the Board of Trade wouldtake over at the outbreak of war or immobilise (i.e.  not allow to be moved or sold except under permit) some 60or 70 classes of essential materials.    The  committee recommended that the Government should take the risk inall such cases (i.e*  give immediate compensation in fullor replacement) when the goods were in the wholesalestage.     The Committee  thought that this fact should be
                                                        loiimade known in advance either &quot;by an announcement or &quot;byconfidential communication to the trading associationsconcerned in order that stocks of such materials shouldnot he allowed to run down through the fear of uncoveredaid raid damage risks.     The Committee recommended that cover should he providedfor export and import goods between ocean-going ship andwarehouse.    This matter has been taken up as part ofthe marine war risks insurance scheme which has been formulated by the Board of Trade,     The Committee thought that the Government shouldtake the full risks on ships under construction.     Finally (Section 27) the Committee recommendedthat the Board of Trade should give early considerationto the possibility of exceptional provision for themaintenance of the trade in commodities outside theGovernment scheme.Present Position.6.     There has been no clear evidence up to the present of any serious check to the importation of vitalcommodities due to the absence of insurance against airrisks, and the approaching announcement of the marine war risks  insurance  scheme  (including the Waterbourne  schemecovering  goods between ship and  warehouse) will no  doubtgo some way to relieve the apprehensions  which have been expressed.    But  it is  clear that,  in order  to secure a continuous supply  of essential goods  notwithstanding  air attack, it will be necessary to  do more than  to offerdeferred  compensation at the end of  the war.   What isnecessary is to  secure that  if such  stocks are  destroyed  theywill be renewed,  and  that  the proper level of stocks  willbe maintained.
                                                        i 9 o                                                        x ti w 7.     This position has heen under consideration hy the Treasury and  the Board  of Trade with the help of a small Committee representing  three of the main Insurance Companies.        It appeared  in the first place that since the Phillips Committee  considered the matter, the plans for taking over or  &quot;immobilising&quot; essential goods at the outbreak of war have been curtailed.   It would still appear likely that  as regards some important  classes of goods, actual Government control of the movement of goods at  different  stages will be close and the simplest plan will no doubt be for the Government to take the Air Raid risk, covering  itself by suitable additions to controlled sale prices.    But  it seems that direct Government assumption of risks will &quot;not cover a sufficiently wide part of the field and there is general agreement that some further  insurance  scheme should be provided.- General Financial Considerations. 8.     The maximum  extent of the application  of  any  scheme would be to commercial  stock in trade, i.e. excluding goods in consumers&apos; hands.   The total field  is  then thought to be  1,500 millions:    and it  is certain that it does not for  instance exceed  2,000 millions.    If the rate of damage  were 15  per  cent,  per annum,  the total damage would  be  225 millions a year and  less  if non- essential goods and shop-keepers&apos; stocks  are  excJuded. This would not  in itself be an impossible burden for the State, being  about  one-seventh part of the total .damage to  all property.  9.     But it is impossible to say that property in general, including  houses,  shall receive  compensation deferred to the end of  the  war and possibly then partial                         -5-
compensation only while property in goods attractsimmediate compensation in full.   The difference in treatment must clearly &quot;be marked by requiring the owners of goods to pay a premium.   The owners of goods are morefortunately placed than owners of buildings as they canin general pass on the cost of insurance to the consumer.There is however a fallacy to be guarded against in thisconnection.   A premium on buildings is nearly always anannual premium and a premium on goods is also expressed at an annual rate.   But the premium on goods is onlypayable for the period that the goods are held (or if itis a real annual payment it covers a whole succession of similar goods constantly turned over).   If the averageperiod of turnover of goods is three months, the increasein price required to compensate the owner for an insurancepremium of X is not X but X.                          4Scheme to be worked through Insurance Companies.10.     There is general agreement that the scheme shouldbe worked through the Insurance Companies.   It is agreat advantage both to those responsible for the schemeand to those insuring under it that this type of insurance should be worked as a supplement to existing-insurances against fire.     The amount of work placed on insurance companies would in war be very great:  even on goods alone theestimated air  risk damage is very many times greaterthan the whole annual damage to property, includingbuildings, Toy fire.   Arrangements are in an advanced stage for forming pools of assessors in connection withthe main compensation scheme for damage to property
generally,,   The services of these assessors will haveto he placed at the disposal of the insurance companies in connection with damage to goods:  it is believed thatsimple working arrangements can be-devised in thisconnection and in any case no other1 possibility is open.The owner of goods covered by the scheme will pay hispremiLtrns to his insurance companies and receive compensation through them   The scheme will of course be for the account of the Government,  the insurance companies being paid for the work done.       Up to the present three leading insurance companies have been consulted as well as the Chairman and deputy Chairman of Lloyds.   The share taken by Lloydsin the insurance of goods is not large, perhaps 10 or12 per cent, of the whole, though they have a biggerstake in certain commodities such as rubber.   Beforethe scheme is amiounced it is proposed to inform the twelve leading insurance companies and to ask theChairman of Lloyds to make such confidential consultationsas he thinks essentialsGoods to be covered by the scheme.11.    It has to be settled- -       (a) whether the scheme should be extended             to all commercial stock in trade or to             essential commodities alone;       (b) down to what stage insurance should be             carried, i.e. whether it  shou.ld apply             to stocks in the hands of importers,             manufacturers, wholesalers, merchants             or whether it should  apply also to             stocks in the hands of retailers.       As regards the first question it is  in the viewof  the Treasury impossible to contemplate the insurance of  all goods indiscriminately.   It is not  thoughtpossible  to provide full  and immediate compensation(even though a premium be paid) to the owners of stocksof  non-essential  commodities, e.g. fur coats, cigars,
etc.5 while delayed compensation and perhaps  only  partialcompensation is paid in respect of damaged residences.So far as essential goods are concerned,  the  distinctionbetween goods and buildings can be maintained since thecontinued import and movement of such goods is vital tothe life of the community.   This is also the view of theinsurance companies which have been consulted.  It isunderstood that the Board of Trade are prepared to accepta decision on these lines though they believe that therewill be considerable pressure to make the scheme applyto all commoditiesc       It will be necessary therefore to  publish a listof commodities covered by the scheme, or  alternativelyif found simpler a list of excluded commodities.  Sincethe export trade will be covered, the great bulk of commodities will be included in the scheme.12.    As regards goods in retail shops similar con-siderations apply0   It must suffice that the Governmentlooks after the import of essential goods and theirdistribution about the country.   It can be safely  -anticipated that, collectively, retailers will stock onthe scale necessary to meet the popular demand and thatif some are deterred at any particular time by fear ofwar loss from holding their normal stocks the deficiencywill be made tip by others.   Even if this were not thecase, the fact remains that our insurance advisersconsider that the inclusion of retailers would entirelyoverload the scheme a::.-.d it is useless putting up plansthat will not workc13.    With these considerations borne in mind the definition of the scope of the scheme might be &quot;any goods of a kind which in the opinion of the Board  ofTrade would be essential for the vital needs  of the
                                                    1*1 f\community in the event of war, including the maintenanceof the export trade, and whether such goods are rawmaterials, commodities or goods  in process of manufacturebut not including commodities or goods in the hands ofretailers or goods not held by way of trade&quot;.       Some supplementary explanations would be needed to make clear for example that the scheme would coverships in course of construction,,Should the scheme bo compulsory?14-.    Arguments for compulsion:  The scheme is founded on the necessity of holding in this country at all timesat least the normal stocks of commodities which wouldbe vital to the life of&quot; the nation in. the event of war.It would seem that the fact that the scheme was compul-sory would strengthen the Government&apos;s hands.  a limitation to vital commodities and exports would be consistent with compulsion  and the element of compulsionwould introduce a measure of disunion among the criticswho sought a general extension of an &quot;insurance&quot; scheme.Compulsion would no doubt be resisted by those brought within the scheme who considered themselves to be outsidethe danger areas but resistance, where vital commodities are concerned, would have little public sympathy,particularly as it could not be claimed with any certainty that any particular area would be free from attack.       If the scheme were voluntary, those owners whosupposed themselves safe would stand out and even in what were obviously danger areas holders of some commodities,e,g, stocks of road making materials, would not insure.The Government would be left with an unfair share of the bad risks.
i 9*f15.   Oompulsion in war does not involve compulsion inpeace,   It is not thought, in view of the injury totrade, desirable to attempt by collecting substantialpremiums now to build up a considerable fundo      Thus in peace the scheme is limited to registration.The practical object aimed at is as follows.   The great bulk of the goods should be covered before the nextcrisis starts;   otherwise if registration is voluntarythe Insurance Companies will be completely swampedwith work as the alarm spreads and that possibly at atime when their staffs are being depleted and they are considering the moving of records etc to safe places.There will be one &quot;sanction&quot; against those who fail to register, namely that they would be excluded even fromthe general compensation scheme0      The plan which seems most suitable is thatregistration should be possible in peace at a smallfee sufficient merely to cover expenses0  /Perhaps3d. per  100 or possibly a flat fee of  1*lo 0do up to 20,000,  3.3o0do from  20,000 to  50,000 and  5.5.0d.over  50,000:  under either -plan there would be a flat charge of 5/-d. on each subsequent endorsement./7But for registration after the outbreak of war adecidedly higher fee should be charged.   It is thoughtparticularly in view of the desire of Bans to see thatgoods on which they have made advances are covered,that practically all goods would be registered inpeace under this arrangement.
16.   As against Compulsion it might he urged that theGovernment has to meet a charge that traders must be given an opportunity to cover their risks.   The charge is met if we give the op-port unity.      There is no real precedent for compulsorycommercial insurance except in connection with third party risks.      It is a strong order to compel traders to insurein circumstances where it is impossible for them toknow to what height premiums may rise in the course ofa war.   It would be a strong order also, if registrationis voluntary during peace, to make them pay a fine forlate registration under compulsion in war.      The sanction (that if a trader refuses anopportunity to insure essential goods he will not evenreceive compensation on those goods after the war should they be damaged) may be sufficient to make a voluntaryscheme work particularly as bankers would want to know that goods on which they make advances are covered.      On the other hand there is, of course, no answer to the point that if insurance is voluntary theGovernment will be left with the worse risks and mighthave to charge more in the dangerous areas or on goodsspecially liable to damage because the goods to whichless risk attaches have not been brought into thescheme by their owners.      On the whole, I urge that the scheme should becompulsory, i.e0 essential stocks held during the warmust be insuredo
Premiumse17.    If the scheme is compulsory, registration will carry with it the obligation to pay as from the outbreakof war such premiums as may be fixed from time to time.It must be expected that the criticism will be made that persons who are insured (particularly if asked to insurevoluntarily) should know in advance rf&amp;xt the premium willbe, and that the addition of an unexpectedly high premiumfor insurance to their other costs may expose those whohave already entered into contracts to loss0       As regards the last point, the answer is that theywould be liable to far greater and catastrophic losses ifthey were not insu.red0   No doubt some provision will be needed to permit of an adjustment of contract arrangements in hard cases to allow for the instirance chargec       It does not seem possible to give information inadvance as to the rate of premium beyond a generalassurance that the premium will in the interests of tradebe kept as low as practicable and will be adjusted as experience shows to be necessary;  but I will consult  thePresident of the Board of Trade on this point before any public announcement,,18.    I have described the scheme at this length in orderthat the Cabinet may have the opportunity of forming a judgment on a very complicated matter, the working out ofwhich in detail must be left to the Board of Trade and itsexperienced advisers0   The special matters on which aCabinet decision is needed are:-       (a)  That the Government scheme for insuring stocks             against air raid risks should be applied to             essential commodities alone (paragraph 11).       (b)  That this insurance should extend as far as             stocks in the hands of merchants but not to             stocks in the hands of retailers (paragraph 12)       (c)  Whether the scheme should be compulsory, i.eB             that essential stocks held during the war             must come under the Government scheme             &quot;(paragraph 14) 0 .
19.    There remains the question of compensation for personal injuries of civilians caused hy enemy action.My colleagues will remember that on the 9th December lastI circulated a Memorandum on this subject (CP. 287 (38)),and that it was subsequently agreed that an announcementof the Government&apos;s policy should be made, in somewhatgeneral terms, at the same time as that concerningcompensation for damage to propertyo   I undertook toexamine further the drafting of this announcement, inconsultation with the Lord Privy Seal and the ministers of Health and of Pensions0   I hope to have an agreeddraft ready by the time this paper is considered.       I should add that, while I agree that theannouncement itself should be in general terms, I thinkit will be difficult to refuse to? give details of thescope of the scheme, and the classes of civilians to whom it will apply, as soon as all questions still outstandinghave been settledo   On the other hand I would certainlypropose that the scal-e of compensation to be granted to civilians should be kept secret, just as much as thescale of pensions proposed for war-time recruits to the armed Forces, which it is not intended to divulge beforethe emergency 0       If pressed therefore, I would propose to undertaketo lay as soon as possible a White Paper outlining thescope of the scheme.

Colonel Nathan, - To ash the President of the          Board of Trade, whether he has received          from any and if so which local government          authorities representations, in view of          the recent decision of insurance companies          not to undertake insurance of property          against damage &quot;by a Foreign enemy, urging          upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the          introduction of a scheme of national          insurance to cover risks of that character;          and what action His Majesty&apos;s Government          propose to take thereon,s 37.  Mr. Joel, - To ask the President of the Board          of Trade, whether he is aware of the desire          of propel1 ty owners in London and all parts          of the Country that the Government should          introduce some scheme to enable them to          insure against the eventualities of war          risks;  and whether he can now take steps to          draw up such a scheme, in view of the fact          that no insurance company in Great Britain          at the present tine is prepared to provide          insurance against such risks.MR. OLIVER STANLEY:          With the Hon.  Members&apos; permission, I willanswer this question and No-57 together.          I have received a letter from theWan&amp;sworth Borough Council to the effect indicated inthe first part of question No. 29.   On the general principle involved, I would refer&quot;the Hon.  members to the conclusion of the Government which was announced to this House by my predecessor on the4th May that no scheme of insurance of property inthis country against war risks on land would be appropriate to the conditions of a future war so faras they can be foreseen today;  and that, should the contingency arise the question of putting intooperation any scheme of compensation will be one forAPPENDIX I.

COLONEL NATHAN:   Is it to be understood that His       Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared now, on in the       near future to introduce legislation which would       protect property, and the owners and lessees of       property, against such damage?       MR.  OLIVER STANLEY:   It does not seem to me to be an       appropriate subject for legislation;  it is a matter       for the decision of-the-.Government, at the time y/hen       the emergency-arises.       COLONEL NATHAN:   In view of the unsatisfactorsr nature       of the reply, I beg to give notice that I will raise       the matber on the Ad journment--at &quot;the earliest       opportunity.17th May, 1938.       26.   Mr. Storey asked, the President of the Board of               Trade whether any decision has yet been               reached as to a scheme for compensation to              1 property owners for damage caused by enemy               action in time of war?       32.   Major Sir Herbert Cayzer asked the President of               the Board of Trade whether, in view of the               recent decision of the British insurance               companies and. underwriters that they are               unable to cover private property against               damage or destruction as the result of enemy               action in war time, he  is now able to say what               progress has been made  in the inauguration of               a Government scheme to  cover this risk?
     THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE (Mr.  Oliver Stanley):            As I explained in my answer to the Hon.  and     Gallant Member for Wandsworth Central (Colonel Nathan)     and the Hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Joel) on 2nd November     last, the question of puting into operation any scheme     of compensation, should the contingency arise, would be     one for the Government of the day to decide in the light     of the circumstances of the timec   Such preparatory work     as can usefully be undertaken in time of peace to     facilitate the eventual application of a scheme of     compensation is well in hand.14th June, 1938.     k 50.  Mr, De La Bere: -  To ask Mr. Chancellor of the               exchequer, whether, with a view to allaying the               anxiety of merchants who normally maintain               substantial stocks of essential foodstuffs, the               Government will consider including these               merchants in their plans for insurance against               air-raid damage^      .&apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;:&apos;::::;V&apos;,&apos;                --^Vi v                  &apos;     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER: -  As my Right Hon.     Friend the President of the Board of Trade has explained     in answer to a number of Questions in the House, the     Government do not think that Air Raid damage to property     on land in this country is an appropriate subject for     insurance but such preparatory work as can usefully     be undertaken in time of peace to facilitate the     operation of a scheme of compensation, if its     application should be decide.ed upon, is well in hand.     The position in this respect of traders in essential     foodstuffs has not been, overlooked,
25th September, 1958,        BY PRIVATE NOTICE.        Mr, Hall Caine - To ask the Chancellor of the          Exchequer, whether in view of the serious          international situation and the possibility of          an outbreak of hostilities he will forthwith          introduce a compulsory scheme of insurance to          insure the homes and property of the people of          this country.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER - As already stated tothe House, the Government after full investigationreached the conclusion that war risks to property on land in this country are not an appropriate subject for insurance, i.e, for the payment of graduated premiumson the one hand and an undertaking to compensate anfull on the other.

The Government are discussing with the interests concerned a scheme to supplement, by means of a re-insurance scheme on a premium basis, the existing facilities for insurance against King&apos;s Enemy Risks of cargoes consigned to and from this country while theyare on the ocean-going ship.  This scheme is designed,Inter alia, to remove certain conditions of war risksinsurance which seriously hampered the trade of thiscountry during the last crisis, such as the clause which
made Marine War Risk Insurance subject to 48 hoursnotice as regards future shipments.  It is intended that the scheme should also make provision for theinsurance against King&apos;s Enemy Risks, on a premium basis,of imported and exported merchandise whilst in transitbetween the ocean-going ship and warhouse in thiscountry.  Goods in transit between ocean-going ship and &quot;warehouse have been uninsurable in the market since february, 1958, following the conclusion of the &quot;Water-borne&quot; Agreement between the principal marine insurancemarkets of the world.  On the outbreak of a major warin which this country is involved, the above facilitiesfor the war risks insurance of the goods concerned willbe afforded by a Government Cargo War Risks InsuranceOffice.
