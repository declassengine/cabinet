THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT   7 4            TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to    ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.CCS.824.                                               Copy No.                     COMMITTEE  OP  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.                     CHIEFS  OF  STAFF SUB-C0I.H.1ITTEE.                 STRATEGIC IMPOETAHCE OF EGYPT AND THE                  ARAB COUNTRIES OF &quot;THE&quot; MIDDLE EAST.                 ( Previous Reference: Paper rTo.CCS.822 ).                                   REPORT.                 The Palestine Conference will shortly open in London                                            s          and  at  its conclusion  the policy governing the future          administration  of the  British Mandate in Palestine will have          to he determined.                 At  such  a time  we  consider it to he our duty to place on          record, for  the infprEiation of the Cabinet and the Committee of          Imperial Defence, a summary of those strategic factors of          importance which, concern our eastward lines of communication -          sea, land  and air - and the security of our garrisons  and          forces  throughout the  Middle East,                 The reasons  which impel us to take this course          are  as  follows:-               (a)  The security of our forces and  of our                  lines  of communication  depends  on our ability                   to  convince Egypt  and the Arab  states that  it                   will be to their  interest to  observe  their  Treaty                   obligations, where these  exist, or  to maintain                   friendship with Great Britain where no Treaties                   have been concludedo
                                                          t d      (b) In our view,, if our future policy          in relation to Palestine is such that it          cannot be accepted by the Arab states as          equitable, and is not a clear earnest of          our intentions to maintain their friendship,          these states who are already shalcen in their          belief in our good intentions will at last          become alienated - if not actively hostile.      (c) We have ample evidence that nothing          would be more welcome to the Totalitarian          States than to see the disappearance of our          predominant position in the eyes of the Moslem          world.  Germany in particular is already          active in the support of those subversive          influences at present ranged against us.      (d) Our hold  on  the Middle East  is ssa.          essential in  our present scheme of Imperial          Defence on account of Air Communications.2*     Egypt is the country through which run our sea andair communications to India and the Par East.  Through it also run our land and air communications to the Sudan andthe African colonies.   Its territories provide the necessaryareas for the military defence of the Suez Canal and for themaintenance of the requisite land and air garrisons.  Theport of Alexandria provides the only large harbour in theEastern Mediterranean from which the Navy can maintain oursea power in the Eastern Mediterranean in a war in \vhichItaly is hostile.5.     Palestine and Transjprdan..  These countries normallyrequire the presence of small garrisons for the maintenanceof internal security and for their protection against external aggression.   Their position in Imperial strategy
i is an important one.   In the first place,  Palestine providesadded depth for the protection of the Suez Ganal - a matter which increases in importance with the constant growth inthe ranges of aircraft.  It is also the channel through whichpass our air communications with India and the Par East.At Haifa we have the terminal of our main strategic landline of comiiiunication with our air garrison in Iraq and ofour land lines of communication with the Persian Gulf andIndia.   Haifa is also the outlet of the I.P.C. pipeline from iraq, and a potential &quot;oase for light Naval forces operating in the Eastern Mediterranean.4*     Iraq.  The air forces in this country serve the doublepurpose of maintaining our air communications, strategicaland civil, with India and the Par East and of protecting our most important oil interests in Iraq and Iran.  At Habbaniyahand Basra fully equipped air bases have been established whichare remote from air attack by our potential enemies.  Inaddition,the overland route from Basrah to Palestine and Egypt,to which we attach considerable importance, runs through Iraq.5*     Saudi Arabia.   Saudi Arabia is so placed geographicallythat British interests could be threatened from any point onits frontiers.  Saudi Arabia has the power to threaten our land and oil lines of communication running throughTrans Jordan and Iraqj  it can menace Trans [Jordan, Koweit andour protected Sheikdoms in the Persian Gulf, and our frontiersin the Aden Protectorate.  Alone, Ibn Saud, if he so chose,could cause us considerable military embarrassment, but should he fall under the active influence of either germany or Italy, his capacity to cause trouble would be greatlyincreased.
 6.      The  Yemen  and the  Aden Protectorate.  If the  Imam of the Yemen came  under the  influence  of  Italy, he might  afford the Italians  facilities for  attacking  Aden, in addition to making trouble  himself.-   A small  air force is stationed in the Aden Protectorate for the maintenance of internal  security and for protection against external aggression.   In addition, the. port of Aden  is essential to  the maintenance  of  sea po\&quot;/er in the.  Red  Sea and  of  our sea communications with the East. 7.      The  foregoing paragraphs set out  the main  reasons which make  the.good will  of  Egypt and  of the Arab countries in  the Near East  of great importance to  our Imperial strategy. The plans which have been made to safeguard our position in  that theatre have been based on  the assumption that Egypt and Iraq will,  on the outbreak of war, fulfil their  Treaty-obligations as  allies of  Great Britain.  We have  also hitherto assumed  that the Arab states of  the Middle East would,  at any rate,  not assist our  enemies.   Were the reverse to  be the case, the measures necessary to provide an adequate defence in  the  Middle East would  call  for very large increases in  the land  and  air forces  and some increase in  naval forces.Evon  then .&apos;it  might not be possible  to  guarantee securitysespecially  if Arab  antagonism was reinforced by religioussympathy from the rest of  the  Moslem worlds 8..      In our review of the  comparative  strength  of  Great Britain with  that of certain other  nations as at  January, 1938 (Paper No. G.0.S.639) we stated:-  &quot;Without  overlooking the assistance  which we should hope to obtain from Prance, and possibly  other allies, we cannot foresee the  time  when our defence forces  will be strong enough to safeguard  our
territory, trade and vital interests against Germany,Italy, and Japan simultaneously ...&quot;   If the balancewere to he weighed against us even more heavily by the hostility of the Arab States of the Middle East, ourposition would he still more grave.
