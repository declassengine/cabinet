0 &amp;(THIS DOCUMENT  18  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY?S GOVERNMENT). SECRET. C.P.   18   (59).                             C. A 3  Ii N  B  To                        PRACTICE RANGE FOR ARMOURED                             FIGHTING VEHICLES.                          Report of  Cabinet Committee.           1.      At their meeting  on the 9th November,  1938,  (Cabinet           54  (38), Conclusion 9),  the  Cabinet had before  them a           Memorandum by  the Secretary  of State  for War  (CP.  244  (58)),           asking for authority to  purchase  land at Linney Head,           Pembrokeshire, for the construction of a practice range for           armoured fighting vehiclese           2*      The Cabinet were  informed  that the War Office had           carried out  a  comprehensive  reconnaissance of the whole of           Great  Britain, before-re coming to the conclusion  that no           reasonable alternative to Linney  Head was possible.,           5.      It was  claimed as one advantage of the Linney Head           site that a  sea danger area  cou.ld be  obtained;  this enabled           the size of  the range to be  limited to 6,000 acres.   It was           stated that  at least 20,000  acres  would be required if a           purely inland range had  to be  constructed,,                   On the  other hand, the  present owner (Lord Cawdor) had           given  the public  free access to the whole of this part of the           coast.   The acquisition of  the land  for war purposes would           accordingly mean  that the public would be deprived  of the           enjoyment of a boaut;Lful and xuispoilt stretch of coastal           scenery now  accessible to them.    This was likely to give           rise to some controversy,,COPY NO.
-S -  &apos; -&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;             .  &apos;        A more material  objection was  that  the  acquisition of the  site  would table   out  of  cultivation  one  of the best tracts  of agricultural  land  in Wales. 4*     In these  circumstances  the Cabinet  agreed to refer the proposal for further consideration  to  a Committee comprising -        The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.                                   (Chairman) *        The Secretary of State  for War.        The Secretary of State  for Scotland,,        The Minister of  Health.        The Minister of  Agriculture and  Fisheries.        The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.        .       &apos;  ,&apos;                       . 50     The War Office have  set out in the  memorandum which forms the Appendix to our Report the  essential require- ments of an  armoured fighting  vehicles  range.   It will                          -     &apos;         -IS.        :&quot;:. .     I be appreciated that it  is not  an easy matter in a highly developed country like  Great Britain  to find a tract of land fulfilling  all these requirements.        It may be enough to state here that the War Office requirements include firing  areas,  with ad.ecaiate ground for manoeuvre, extending from,  at least  1,500 yards to 100  yards.    The surface  of the ground  ought to be such as will  not  &quot;cut up&quot;  unduly.   A danger area is required of 8,500 yards  in depth and 1,500 yards  laterally from any point at  which a shell  may strike.  ,  In addition.,  the range of  modern  weapons tends  to increase  and  this.makes it desirable that there should be further  facilities for-increasing the danger area.       Range accommodation is  required  annually for 19 Regular  and  7  Territorial units.    Each unit requires two weeks&apos; practice,  so that 53  unit weeks&apos; practice in all is necessary.    The existing range  at Lulworth can provide
 8 unit weeks&apos; practice, which leaves 44 unit weeks&apos; practice  to he found elsewhere.   Other considerations limit the period for practice camps to 24 weeks, between April and September inclusive.,       It therefore appears to be essential that the new range should be capable of accommodating two units at any one time. 6.     We have ourselves examined the possibilities of some 25 alternative sites for the proposed range, and new reconnaissances have been carried out at our request in different parts of the country.   In every case, with three exceptions, we have discovered the presence of insuperable objections, for example, the presence of villages, main roads and main line railways;  the mountainous or boggy  nature of the ground;  its intersection, by streams etc. 7.     The only sites where objections of this order were not present were:-       ( i) Linney Head.      (ii) An area at Kirkbean, on the north coast of             the Solway Firth.     (iii) An area on the borders of Northumberland and             Cumberland, lying to the north of Hadrian&apos;s             Wall and of the main Newcastle-Carlisle road. 8-.     The conclusion at which we have arrived, as the result of our inquiry, is that the three sites must be placed in the above order of priority.       ( i) The Linney Head site appears to be the most suitable, taking all relevant considerations into account. It provides a good surface and good observations of fire.Above all, it is the only site which has accommodation for two units at a time.,   The area of suitable ground atLinney Head is approximately twice as large as that at Kirkbean.
      The chief objections to Linney Head are therisk. pjf... gAying. rise to controversy, the sterilizationof good farming land, and the fact that the priceasked for the site, though only 6,000 acres in extent,is as much as  250,000.   It is considered by the WarOffice that the price is excessive, and it is hopedthat it can be reduced,,      (ii)  TheKiPkboan (Solway Firth) site is muchcheaper;  it is estimated to cost  50,000.   The groundis, generally speaking, firm and  suitable, but, owingto the direction in which firing would take place andto the nature of the ground, observation of fire wouldbe bad.   Only one unit at a time could be accommodated.      A larger area might be obtained by an extension to the west.   This land, however, is flat.and the WarOffice take the view that it -would not provide adequate facilities for realistic practice.      (iii)  The Northumberland site includes two possible areas - Thirlweil Moor and Shitltngton Common.In either case the cost of acquiring the land isestimated at  224,500.   The main attraction of thesesites lies in the  sparsely inhabited nature of theNorthumberland moors,   On the other hand, there are serious disadvantages, including poor observations of fire, accommodation for only one unit at a time, and,above all, the boggy nature of the ground.   This is so marked that it  is thought that tank traffic could notbe supported without drainage of  the land and the con-struction of metalled &quot;runs:t.   The tanks would have tofire from these &quot;runs&quot;, so that realistic battlepractices would be impossible.      It is a further objection that the work ofdrainage and preparation would take some eighteen months to complete (whereas Linney Head  would be ready for usealmost at once).
     In the case of tooth Kirkbean and Northumberlandheavier transport charges would toe involved,in respectof the Regular units who would have to toe sent Northfor firing practice,,9o   The conclusion which we reach, on a review ofthese considerations, is that no course is open to ustout to recommend the Cabinet to approve the purchaseof the Linney Head site, as desired by the Secretaryof State for War.,     In the event of our recommendation being acceptedwe suggest that it might be well to forestall criticismby incorporating in the public announcement a statement to the effect that the decision in favour of the WarOffice proposal was only reached after exhaustive inquirytoy the Government had shorn that no alternative sitewould meet the requirements of an armoured fighting vehicles range; and, further, that urgent defence requirements were the paramount consideration which made it necessary in this case to override agricultural and amenity considerations.

1^1                           APPEKIIX.         MEMORANDUM ET  THE WAR OFFICE  ON A NEW PRACTICE             CAMP AREA FOR ARMOURED FIGHTING  VEHICLES.Re qui r ement s .1.     Range accommodation is  required annually for:-         19 Regular units at 2 weeks each    =  38 unit weeks         . 7 T.A.    units-at 2 weeks each    *  14 unit weeks                                Total      -     52 unit weeks.2.     There exists at present one Armoured Fighting Vehiclesrange at L.ULV70RTK.    This is unsuitable for 2-pounder firingand can accommodate only  one unit at a time.   Further, the time available for practice camp is restricted by the requirementsof the Gunnery Wing Armoured Fighting Vehicles School andby the Annual range practice of approximately 2,200 recruitsat the Combined Depot,         Not more than 4 units can practice at this &apos; range.         This is equivalent to ...    ....         8 unit weeks.-3.     Hence fresh range accommodation has to be found for -                                                44 unit \weeks.4*    The necessity for preliminary weapon training instructionduring the individual training period restricts the period forPractice Camps to the period April - September inclusive, i.e. -                                                24 weeks.5.     Thus the site for the new Armoured Fighting Vehicles rangemust be capable of.&apos;providing range accommodation for two units at any one time.Essentials of an Armoured Fighting Vehicles Range.6.     The following are required.    a. Good surface -which will not &quot;cut up&quot; unduly.    b. Good observation of fire.    c. Sufficient ground so that two units may be exercised at          the same time.    d. Adequate ground for manoeuvre in the firing areas which          have to extend from at least 1,500 yards to 100 yards.    e. Sufficient depth in the target area to allow the placing          of targets, mobile and stationary, at varying ranges.    f. The profile of the ground must be such that targets can          be engaged from &quot;hull down&quot; and &quot;turret down&quot; positions          i.e. the lie of the land must be such that ranges are          not artificialc    g.. An adequate area for battle practice so that personnel          may be exercised under conditions similar to that          Obtaining in war.    h. A d,anger area of 8,500 yards in depth and 1,500 yards          laterally from any point at which a shell may strike.          Facilities shoiild be available for increasing this          /area as the range of modern weapons tends to increase.          -As a consequence of this a sea danger area is          desirable.

THIRL v/ELL MOOR (Hear IIALT&apos;7HI8TLE ,  NORTHUMBERLAND). a.  Advantages.   i)     Sparsely inhabited area.   &apos;ii)    Little displacement of population.   iii)   Low agricultural value,   ,iv)    Mediocre sporting amenities.   [v)     Low value of land.   ,vi)    Suitable camp site. b.  Disadvantages.  (i)     Boggy ground incapable of supporting tank traffic        without drainage and construction of metalled &quot;runs&quot;        from which tanks would fire.   This would involve        costly outlay and upkeep.  Realistic battle practices        could not be fired.  (ii)    The necessary work is estimated to take 18 months        to complete, and even then drainage might not  be        satisfactoryi.  (iii)   Poor observation of fire.  (iv)    Contains two working collieries employing about        100 men, one of which was recently started with the        help of the NUFFI2LD TRUST.  (v)     Considered altogether unsuitable by representative        of the Gunnery V/ing Armoured Fighting Vehicles        School.  (vi)    Range accommodation for only one unit at a time. c.  Cost.  (i)     Estimated purchase price        including compensation      ...     ...    152,500  (ii)    Estimated cost of engineer work        (excluding that required on a normal        range)           0.o        ...     ...     72,000                                     Total         224,500  (iii)   Estimated cost of transport for        Regular units per annum     ...     ...     23,0008.   SHITLINGTON COMMON (Near HEXHAM, NORTHUMBERLAND).         This area has not been reconnoitred in so muchdetail, but the general nature of the country is similarto the THIRLWELL MOOR area, and presents the samedisadvantages.         The bogginess of the ground is, ho-wever, not somarked, but the profiles are less suitable.     The lack of a suitable battle practice area is apparent.     Costs in all respects would be about the same.     One unit only at a time could be exercised.
9.   KIRKHEAIT (DUMFRIESSHIRE)   ^i)      Camp site available.   [ ii)     Good firing areas.   (iii)    Good battle practice area.   ( iv)     Good roads into area.   (v)      Cost not excessive.   (vi)     Ground, generally  speaking, firm and suitable.   (vii)    Little displacement  of population.  b.  Pis advant ages.   (i)      Popularity of adjacent  area for camping,  picnics         etc.   (ii)     Target  areas  sor-.:ewhat  restricted.   (iii)    Possibility  of erosion bjr se&apos;.,    (iv)     Observation  of fire bad,  owing to  nature  of         ground,  the  necessity for  firing  into  the  sun and         the glare  from the water.    (v)      Range  accommodation for only  one  unit  at  a time.   c.   Cost.    (i)       Estimated purchase price         including compensation    ...      ...   50,000.    (ii)     Estimated transport charges         for Regular units per annum        JO,   33,000.10.    LINNEY HEAL (SOUTH WALES).   a*   Advantages.             Camp site available.             An unfrequented  coast,             Good observations of  fire.             Good roads into  area.             Ground  firm  and  suitable.             Livtie  displace;,.ent of population.             Negligible  interference  with fishing  rights.             Excellent battle  practice facilities.             Suitable  of  giving range accommodation for two               units at  any one time.   b.   Disadvantages.     ( i)     High cost.     (ii)    Disturbance of sport in:&quot; rights.     (iii)     Some agricultural land of f?ir productivity would                have to be included.     (iv)   .  Bird sanctuary within, the danger area,     (v)      Two coast guard stations would require  removal or                protecting.    c.   Cost.     (i)      Estimated purchase price                including  compensation ...    ...    3.50,000     (ii)     Estimated annual transport  charges                for  Regular units       ...    ...    ;&apos;;13,500  NOTE:-    The recent  reconnaissance  has  disclosed the fact that  approximately 400  acres of  ST. T&apos;,11.&quot;T&quot;-LI-S and BARREN estates  previously included  in the  area  required, are  not now necessary.
CONCLUSION.11.Estimates of the comparative costs are:-Land.Transportation(Capitalized 5%).a. NORTHULiBERL AND AREAS  224,500 756,665b. KIRKBEAN 50,000 766,666c. LINNEY HEAD 250,000&quot; 450,0005   This sum may be reduced owing to the curtailment     of the necessary area.12.  Suitability of the area.     At first it would appear that there is little to choose between KIRKBEAN and LINNEY HEAD, although whileKIRKBEAN gives fair conditions, those at LINNEY HEADare ideal.     The over-ruling factor is, however, that whileKIRKBEAN provides range accommodation for only one  unitat a time, LINNEY HEAD has ample room for two.     In order to carry out the essential annual rangepractices, it is imperative  to provide a range capableof accommodating two units at any one time.War Office,15th December, 1938.
