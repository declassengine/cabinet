THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January  1939.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP.  9 (39).                                CABINET.BILL  TO AMEND  THE GOVERNMENT  OF  INDIA  ACT, 1935.              Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.    ON  the  26th October last  my colleagues  approved  in principle  theintroduction early this year of a Bill to amend in certain essential and urgentparticulars the Government of India Act, 1935.  I  described in general terms the scope of the Bill I contemplated in the memorandum (CP. 233 (38) ) which my colleagues  then had under consideration, and stated that, so far as  I couldestimate, none of the provisions which were to be included in it was likely togive rise to controversy here.    Since then the Government of India have pressed upon me very strongly theneed  for further amendment of the Act which  is,  I fear,  almost certain togive rise to considerable controversy  in India  and very possibly in Parliamenthere.   The circumstances in which  this  request has been  made are briefly asfollows :     1.  The Government of India have recently been  devoting their  attention tothe&apos; legislative and other measures which would  be  required in India in theevent of a war, and have been  preparing drafts  of  the Ordinances, Bills and regulations which would  be required.  Their  examination of the matter hasdisclosed the fact that the Emergency Powers  conferred upon them by the act of .1935 are, in their view, in certain respects seriously defective,  in that  they provide the Central Government with insufficient power to control,  direct andco-ordinate the actions  of  Provincial Governments and action in the Provincesgenerally.  As my colleagues will remember, the Act of 1935 brought about a rigidstatutory  delimitation between  the  Legislative and  Executive Powers of theCentral Government on the one hand and of the Provincial Governments on theother.   The framers of the Act recognised  that, in the event of a  seriousemergency, this clear-cut  distinction between Central and Provincial authority might well prove to be contrary  to  the  interests of India generally,  and, bysection 102 of the Act, the Governor-General was therefore given power to issue a Proclamation of Emergency during the currency of  which the Central Legisla-ture would be entitled to regulate any matter by  law, even if that matter appeared in the exclusively Provincial List.  But,  for  somewhat technical reasons withwhich it is unnecessary  to trouble my colleagues in detail, it has been found thatthe mere power to regulate Provincial subjects by Central Legislation would givethe Central  Government  no Executive  Authority  in respect of  subjects soregulated, and, in particular, would not enable the Central  Legislature to confer on the Central Government any  rule-making power in relation to such subjects;with the result that the Central Government would not possess legal power to direct and co-ordinate  action in the Provinces to the extent which would be essential for the execution of their war policies.    In the light of the representations of the Government of India,  I cannot butagree that the powers  conferred by  section 102 of  the Act  upon the CentralGovernment are in certain respects defective, and that, in the event of war,  theywould have to be supplemented by provisions on the lines of the new section 126A,a copy of which I attach to this memorandum,  and which it is now  proposed to       [18484]
include in the contemplated amending Bill.   Nevertheless. I was myself stronglyinclined to the view that it would be a tactical mistake to legislate in peace-time-in a sense which would inevitably give an opening for much controversy in India,on the ground that the Centre was being given authority to ride roughshod overthe carefully framed provisions  of the Act which secure the autonomy of theProvinces.  On this view it seemed to me that the better course would have been to treat this matter as  an item in the programme  of  the wartime emergency legislation of this country, giving  the Government of India a promise, which  i feel  confident  my  colleagues that is to   say  the  Government as  at  present constituted would have endorsed,  that His Majesty&apos;s Government would ensurethe passage of the  necessary one-clause Bill to amend the Government of  india act immediately after the outbreak of war, and I urged this alternative plan uponthe Governor-General.  But when the problem was discussed in the  Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council, it was unanimously decided to press for immediateamendment of the Act, on the ground that theHepartments primarily responsiblecould not accept responsibility for the adequacy of India&apos;s legislative preparations for war on any other basis.    The question turns very largely on a judgment of political reactions in India,and in view of the considered opinion of the Governor-General and his Council,  I felt it impossible so far as I was concerned to withhold my assent to their proposal,and have informed them that,  subject to the agreement of  my colleagues, I am prepared to include the proposed provision in this Bill.    2.  Another  amendment not  contemplated when  I  originally  made  my proposals to my colleagues for this Bill, but which now seems to be inevitable,is connected with customs.  It has been assumed until  quite recently that theentries relating to customs in the Federal Legislative  List (&quot; Import and Exportacross customs frontiers as defined by the  Federal Government&apos;&apos;  and &apos;&apos; duties and customs, including export duties &quot;) would enable the Federal  Governmentto retain the  existing &quot; Viramgam line&quot; a cordon round certain MaritimeStates in Kathiawar where dutiable goods en route from those  States into british  India  are  from  time  to time either held up  or are  subjected toBritish Indian customs  duties where it cannot be shown  that duty has beenlevied at the State ports and if necessary to impose similar customs barriersround other States, even if  the States have federated, in order  to counter an anti-federal economic policy pursued by the State.  My latest legal advice is, however,that it is very doubtful whether the Courts  would take this view of the  customsentries so far, at all events, as States which are members of the Federation areconcerned, and  that in all probability it would be held that &quot; customs frontiers  &quot;means necessarily  the   external  frontiers  of  the  Federation,  and further,necessarily implies a frontier at  which duties of  customs  are actually levied;and accordingly that the  entry gives no power to regulate or prohibit the  passageof goods across the frontier in question otherwise than by  establishment andmaintenance of a permanent line at which customs duties are actually collected.I am advised  therefore  that in order to enable the Central Government with certainty to exercise the control they regard as essential to secure economic unityin the Federation, the customs entries 19 and 44 should be amended to  read asfollows :           &quot; Import and export across the boundaries of any  unit&quot; and &quot; Duties    of Customs, that is to  say, duties on the import or export of goods across the    boundaries of any unit.&quot;    I fully recognise that  an amendment which has  the appearance  of revising the powers of the Federal Legislature so as  to enable  it to set up a criss-cross ofinternal  trade barriers within the Federation may give rise to criticism in bothHouses of Parliament: but  there  is  a complete answer to such  criticism.  Ithas from the outset been admitted that the Indian Federation will of necessitybe, at all events in  its early stages, an imperfect economic unity.   Many of theStates have for years derived considerable revenues from the proceeds of  customsduties imposed by their Rulers upon goods imported into the State from british india or from neighbouring States, and  the Joint Select Committee and Parlia-ment  recognised that, while no encouragement should be given to the extensionof this system which is of  course in essence anti-Federal, it would be impossibleto make it a condition of  Federation  that  a State which has hitherto  enjoyedthis source of Revenue should  forthwith abandon it.  Accordingly, hardly anyof the States which accede to the Federation are likely to  accede in  respect of
customs without  more or less substantial  qualifications and reservations uponFederal powers in  relation to this particular  matter, with the result that theFederal Government will exercise in this regard, as indeed in other respects,  anappreciably lesser range of power in relation to the  States than it will exercise inrelation to British India.  Unless,  therefore, the Federation has in its armourya retaliatory weapon the mere existence of which is likely in most cases to sufficeas a deterrent, without the need for actually bringing it into play, the economic interests of the Federation may be gravely impaired by  anti-Federal action  onthe part of individual units.  Such action is not beyond  possibility on the partof the  Provinces also, who,  despite  the  restrictions  imposed upon them  bySection 297 of the Act, may well find means  of  discriminating  in  favour  ofindustrial enterprise within the Province,  as compared with similar enterprisesoutside its boundaries.    I  propose, however, that the amended entries  in the lists  already referredto should be accompanied  by a provision in the body of the Act  requiring theconsent of  the Governor-General, acting in his discretion,  to the introduction ofany legislative measures intended  to prohibit or restrict or to impose duties  on goods passing the boundaries of an unit.  And I further propose that a passageshould be included in the Governor-General&apos;s Instrument of Instructions charginghim never to utilise this power otherwise than with the object of furthering theeconomic unity of the Federation.  I  believe that  if the amendments take this form reasonable critics will recognise that their object, despite their contradictoryappearance, is to facilitate the production of the very results in this troublesomematter which Parliament had in view when it passed the Act.    3.  I should add  for my colleagues&apos; information that, in pursuance of thelatitude  for adjustment of detail given to  me in the Cabinefs  conclusions uponmy original memorandum,  I have  decided, in consultation with the Governmentof India, to include in the Bill amendments dealing with five other matters not mentioned  in that  memorandum.   None of  these  is likely to  give rise  to  anycontroversy.                                                                        Z.    January  19,  1939.                                ENCLOSURE.                    PROPOSED NEW SECTION 126A.    126A.   Where a  Proclamation of Emergency  is in operation whereby theGovernor-General has declared that the security of  India is threatened by war     (a) the executive authority of the Federation shall extend to the giving of           directions  to a Province as  to the manner  in  which the executive           authority thereof is to be exercised, and any directions so given shall           for  the purposes  of the last preceding section be deemed  to be           directions  given thereunder;    (b) any power of the Federal Legislature to make laws for a Province with           respect to  any matter shall include power to make laws as respects a           Province conferring powers and imposing duties, or authorising the           conferring of powers and the imposition of  duties, upon the Federa-           tion  or officers and authorities of the  Federation  as respects that           matter, notwithstanding that it  is  one with respect to which the           Provincial Legislature also has power to make laws:    Provided that no Bill or  amendment which as respects a Province, conferspowers or imposes duties, or authorises the conferring of powers or the impositionof duties, upon  the Federation or upon  officers or authorities of the federation in relation to such a matter as  aforesaid shall be introduced or moved without theprevious sanction of the Governor-General in his discretion, and the Governor-General shall not give his sanction  unless it appears to him that the provisionproposed to be made is a proper provision in view of the nature of the emergency.
