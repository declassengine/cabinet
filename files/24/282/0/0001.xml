- Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1938.SECRET.                                                           Copy No.   46CP. 1 (39).               TO BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure  the  secrecy of this document.CABINET.EXPORT CREDITS LEGISLATION.            Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE  Cabinet  at  their  meeting  on  the  7th  December  instructed  me(Conclusion 58 (38)) to arrange for a meeting to take place between Representa-tives of the Treasury,  Foreign Office and Board of Trade, in order to determinewhich foreign countries should receive priority of assistance under the new export credits Act.    The representatives of the three above-mentioned Departments have  now submitted their proposals; indicating not only the countries which they consider to be eligible for assistance, but also the amounts which,  in  their opinion, itwould  be appropriate to reserve for allocation to each of  them.   They  are asfollows :           China       ...     ...............    3,000,000         Greece      ..................    2,000,000         Portugal, if required     ............    1,000,000         Egypt, if required...............    1,000,000         Roumanian).................&apos;.    1,000,000         Iraq.....................      500,000         Afghanistan..................      250,000         Iran and Saudi Arabia   ...     ...     ...     ...      250,000Total   ..................    9,000,000     This leaves  1,000,000 in reserve^) for unforeseen contingencies.    (*) The amount of  1,000,000 allocated to Roumania is a compromise figure.  The Foreign -Office are not convinced that an adequate political return can be expected from Roumanfawhile Sir F. Leith-Ross is of opinion that  assistance to Roumania, if it is to be effective mustbe of the order of  1,500,000 at least.    (2) Bulgaria and  Yugoslavia would be eligible for  a part  of this if, as is  possible they require armaments which we are able to supply.10181   [18397]
     In asking my colleagues to approve this proposal, I would explain that its purpose is solely to provide a guide to the amount of credit, in the case of each country, within which applications from United Kingdom exporters or foreignbuyers can usefully be considered  and^ submitted  for Treasury sanction.   Thefigures represent,  of course, the maximum  liability which might fall on theExchequer in each  case; the value of the  orders covered by them  from anyparticular country may for technical reasons sometimes be larger  (for instance,it may be possible in some cases to  obtain part payment  in cash).   The existenceof this list of allocations will not, of course, -relieve the authority responsible for administering  the  scheme  of the  obligation  of  consulting  the  Departmentsconcerned in respect of all transactions under  it.                                                                        H.     December 28,  1938.
