INTRODUCTION    The  increased  Military activity in  Palestine since the arrival&apos;&apos;of  largereinforcements and  the imposition of Military control has been followed by anincreased outburst of propaganda against the measures taken by the troops andby wholesale allegations of brutality and atrocity. Propaganda  of  this naturehas been issued for the whole of the present year by the  Arab PropagandaBureau in  Damascus and its branches in  Egypt and  Iraq, and by the  Arabbureau in London, which has specialized in the production of &quot; atrocity &quot; storiesprovided by Miss Frances Newton. This stream of Arab propaganda has recentlybeen intensified  and has been reinforced  by a violent outbreak of german propaganda on similar lines.  The  German propaganda appears to have twoobjects.  First to provide a smoke  screen to cover the German  governments own delinquencies in the matter of  its treatment of the Jews and secondly topave the way for a discussion of the return of German Colonies and removalof the stigma that Germany is unfit to rule subject races.   To a lesser extentItaly has also contributed to the  present wave  with her usual object of main-taining her nuisance value in the Mediterranean.    As a result of this increase of propaganda there are signs, not only that a section of public opinion in  Great Britain is becoming uneasy that unnecessarilysevere military measures are being taken in Palestine, but also that the BritishGovernment is  beginning to question the  expediency  of the present militaryactivities and the possibility of some relaxation.  This feeling is being encouraged by British  Representatives  in  neighbouring Arab  countries, who,  finding thatthe Governments to which  they  are accredited are becoming disturbed at thepresent wave of propaganda to which they themselves appear to give  somecredence are starting to press for milder measures.   This attitude argues amisconception of the extreme complexity  and difficulty of the military task of restoring law and  order in  Palestine  which make the present measuresessential;  of the real nature of  the operations now  in progress, and of the many and varied interests which not only hamper military  action but lendtheir support wittingly or unwittingly to hostile  propaganda.COPY  NO.
2.  THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PALESTINE    Although there is at the  present time an  armed rebellion in progress inPalestine, it cannot be too strongly emphasized that there is no organized rebelarmy in the  accepted sense against which  the  troops can act to  the exclusion of the remaining peaceful citizens.   Throughout the country the active rebeland the peaceful citizen are inextricably mixed.  The total number of permanentactive rebels in the whole  country probably  does not exceed 1,000-1,500 men,split up in small bodies under  the  command  of the various leaders.  Thesemen are always under arms; often operate in  uniform, and form the permanentnuclei of the rebel gangs.  These small  parties are  reinforced as required bytemporary detachments of  armed fellahin from the neighbouring villages.   Themethods by  which such reinforcements  are  obtained vary.  In parts of thecountry where rebel  sympathies are strong  and organization is best, definitevillage  detachments with leaders and a quota of arms are in existence.  Else-vvhere villagers are pressed into service by  the  permanent gangs for a fixed period and provided with  arms.  Elsewhere  again no regular gangs exist, butsmall parties of rebel sympathisers combine by night for  such activities assniping and  sabotage which have become a recognized  and  remunerative&quot;racket&quot;.                            .    At the present time the rebels&apos; aim, as far as possible, is to avoid being broughtto action by  troops.   Except when a gang is surprised under arms there is nOorganized fighting.  Otherwise  by  day  both  the permanent and temporaryrebels conceal their arms, uniforms, etc.,  and mingle indistinguishably with the peaceful citizens.    Practically every village in  the  country  harbours and supports the rebelsand will assist in concealing their identity from  the Government Forces. while in many cases this is done from sympathy,  in the remainder the same  result has been achieved by terrorism.  For months now a  relentless campaign ofassassination has been  waged against any Arab suspected of  favouring theGovernment  or giving information  against the rebels.  Consequently  villages,where the majority of inhabitants would be  willing to  assist the Government,have been terrorized by the rebel minority into  aiding them.    There is no central command or organization  of  the  rebel bands.   Thegeneral policy is more  or less directed  from  Syria,  but  within  Palestine the lighting leaders are practically independent  in their own areas.   In Samaria,where the rebels are best organized, Abdul Rahim el Haj Mahomed is titularcommander-in-chief.   He probably  controls the largest  number of armed menin the country through  various  minor leaders and detachment commanders.But apart from those  subordinates who  owe him direct  allegiance, he  haspractically no control over other leaders.  Aref Abdul Razzik, also in Samaria,,who  controls rebel  bands numerically  almost  as  great,  is Abdul  Rahim&apos;principal  rival for the position  of commander-in-chief,  and these two leadersare on  such  bad terms that on  more than one occasion open hostilities  havealmost  broken out between them. The relations  of these  two leaders  with the mufti are worth describing as they  typify not only the complicated situationin Palestine,  but also the two  different faces displayed by the present rebellionon the one hand to the outside world and on  the  other to the unfortunate Arab.population.   Abdul Rahim is  a  man of  good family and some  education andis a more honest  and genuine  patriot than  the  majority  of rebels.   He  has,so  far  as  possible within his lights, endeavoured  to  conduct his campaignon decent lines and dislikes intensely the campaign of assassination and intimidate-tion waged against all  moderate Arabs  who might oppose Haj Amin&apos;s  (the mufti&apos;s) policy.   He  maintains  an  attitude  of considerable  independence toorders from Syria, frequently  refusing to carry them out when they offend hisprinciples.  For this  reason and because  he formerly  had moderate politicalconnections,  he is regarded with suspicion by  the Mufti, but is retained in hisposition partly for his  not inconsiderable organizing  ability,  but still  morebecause his known good character and high principles make him an admirablefigurehead for external propaganda which  seeks to  represent the  rebellionas a  pure  and  patriotic  movement.  Aref  Abdul  Razzik  is  a  man of much  lower  origin  and  less  education  than  Abdul  Rahim,  and entirelyunprincipled. Starting  as  a very minor leader 12 months ago, he has  achievedhis present position by  a career of  utter ruthlessness and implicit obedience to
Haj AmhVs orders, whatever they involve.  He consequently enjoys the complete confidence of  the rebel leaders  outside Palestine and is their. principal agentin maintaining the terrorist grip  on the Arab population.   Incidentally,  rieundoubtedly pockets a large rake-off from forced subscriptions to rebel itindswhich Abdul Rahim does not do.    Elsewhere there are practically no  major leaders controlling a number ofgangs,  and  the various minor leaders are practically completely independent and often at open enmity  with  each other.  Thus, in addition to there being no standing armed rebel force against which the troops can act, there is no centralorganization whose destruction  would cause the rebellion to collapse.   Thereare, moreover, definite signs that as the grip of the rebels on the countrysideis weakened by military action, the situation will be further complicated by the emergence of  Arab anti-rebel gangs formed  by those moderate  elements who wish to take revenge on those who have supported the  rebel terror.   One suchgang is already  active near Jenin under Fakhri  Abdul Hadi, a  former leader of the  1936 rebellion.    In  the urban  areas  there  are  two  principal rebel elements the moreeducated effendis class who are engaged in organizing the supplies, finance, andgeneral maintenance and administration of the  gangs, running the rebel courts,and similar activities and  the lower class of terrorist &quot; thugs &quot; who by assassina-tion, abduction and intimidation of  all sorts maintain  a grip of terror on thetown populations as effective as that of the armed gangs on the  villages.  the exact scope and influence of the activities  of the effendi  class are not easy to define at the moment.  There is no doubt that such activities as the establish-ment of rebel courts, the attempts that have been made  to regularize thecollection of  rebel funds  and  to eliminate indiscriminate  extortion for thebenefit  of individual leaders, and the propaganda  by means of communiquesand manifestos which  are  issued in  the name of leading gangsters at frequent intervals,  have all given the educated class an opportunity to  regain some of theinfluence  which they had  lost,  almost  completely, during the summer.  It isreported that  all the principal leaders now have a judge, a financial secretary,a supply officer and a political secretary of this class.  Nevertheless, the  effendishave not  gained any real  control of the fighting leaders, and in fact continueto be terrorized by fear of being  &quot;bumped  off&quot;.  They may give  advice butthey cannot give orders, which come direct to the gangs  from Syria, and in suchmatters as the relaxation of the rebel ban on acceptance of  identity cards andtravel  passes for the benefit of  the citrus traffic, the  effendis have to seek the permission  of  the gang leaders.  The reason, of course,  is that the power of the rebellion  and  the safety of its  supporters from Government action  depend onthe terrorism imposed  on the population by the man with the gun, and  it is thegang leaders who control the armed forces, including to a great degree the townterrorists.    Even in the large towns there is  little sign that the educated classes combineto give general support to the  gangs.   It seems rather  that  the principal gangleaders have each their little group  of supporters who  undertake for them thecollection of money, purchase of clothing, abduction  of offenders for trial, etc.,etc.  Each of  these groups  has its own squad of terrorists working for it. Thus,in Jaffa Abdul Rahim, Aref Razzik and the local leader  Hassan Salameh all have their own  agents working for them and extorting money from the town,with the result that quarrels over the division of spoil and allotment of victimsfor fleecing are  continuous.  The bigger gang leaders  spread their agents farafield  as  in the case of Aref Razzik who is known to command  support  asfar away as Gaza.                           3. MILITARY MEASURES     (a) Searches.   From the previous paragraph it follows that except on rareoccasions there is no separate armed rebel force which the military can engage.The problem  is rather to  identify and remove the active rebel element,  bothpermanent and temporary, from the towns and villages  where they are circulate-ing  unarmed and inextricably mixed with the  peaceful  inhabitants.   As  aresult  of the information collected over the  past two years  and the increasing number of Arab informants now coming forward, the names of a very largeproportion  of the active rebels  in the country are known.   The real difficulty   (2687)                                                               A,
is identification.  In almost all cases wanted men give false names and owingto terrorism are supported by the rest of the population.  The only successfulmethod is therefore for wanted men to be picked out by persons who can actuallyrecognize them. The number of &quot; identifiers &quot; is limited.   The Police can assistto a certain extent and there are now in  most districts a  number of Arabs whoare volunteering to assist the Government Forces in this way, provided adequatesteps are taken to protect them by concealing their identity.    The normal military operation now being carried out in Palestine is there-fore a &quot; check and search &quot; of a village, an area or a portion of a town, with theobject  of rounding up known rebels.  Such  an operation must necessarily becarried  out in considerable force because it is frequently undertaken on infor-mation  that an armed band is in the area which  may be surprised under armsand brought to battle, or  which  would  actively oppose an inadequate force.The usual procedure for such an operation is as follows:           A cordon round the area to  be  searched is  first established  either by    troops or  aircraft and the inhabitants are warned that anybody attempting    to  break through the cordon  is liable to be shot.  As literally hundreds of    villages have been searched, in some cases more than once, during the past    six months this procedure is well known and it can be safely assumed that    cordon-breakers have  good reasons  for  wishing  to  avoid the troops.  A    number of such cordon-breakers have been shot  during searches and it is    probable that such cases form the basis of propaganda that Arab prisoners    are shot in cold blood and reported as  &quot;killed  while trying to escape&quot;.    After the cordon is established the troops enter the village and all male in-    habitants are collected for identification and interrogation.         It must be realised that when the innocent and the guilty are completely    mixed together and quite undistinguishable at sight,  there is no alternative    to  the collection of all males, irrespective  of any excuse, if wanted men are    to  be prevented from slipping through the net by giving false accounts of    themselves.  Inevitably this process involves  a certain amount of hardship    which falls  equally on the innocent and the guilty, and the spectacle of    weeping women watching their menfolk  marched off for identification, or    reports of. the temporary detention of  honest Government servants, naturally    offer opportunities for propaganda, but in  the present conditions no other    course.is possible.         As  soon as the males have been collected and  while identification is    proceeding,  a house to house search of the village is carried out to discover    hidden men, arms equipment, rebel  documents,  etc., etc. These searches,    when undertaken by troops owing to the shortage  of Police,  are  carried    out  by properly organized  search  parties  under  Officers  and  N.C.Os.    Stringent  orders are issued and every precaution taken to prevent looting    or wanton destruction of property or food.  Inhabitants are warned before-    hand to leave everything unlocked to avoid unnecessary damage, but where    these orders are disobeyed some damage is inevitable owing to the necessity    of  breaking open locked doors, cupboards,  etc.  It is essential to  search    such things as cornbins,  and oil jars because both are favourite  hiding    places for arms and ammunition; but damage to their contents is avoided    as  far as possible.  Search parties are normally accompanied by Police  and    by the village Mukhtar who signs a certificate on completion that no un-    necessary damage has been done.  Women  are  not searched or molested    in  any  way except  on occasions when  the services  of  a Police  woman    searcher are available.  Women searchers  are occasionally employed as a    deterrent  against rebels disguising themselves as  women, as has happened   &apos; on  several occasions.   Mosques are not entered or searched except at the    invitation of the guardian and the village Mukhtar and then only by a party    under an  Officer.         The majority of  the male  inhabitants  are  released as soon as the    primary identification and interrogation are completed, only those who have    been identified as known or suspected as active participants in rebellion    being detained.  These are normally  removed to selected places where they    are  held  temporarily for detaild  checking  and interrogation.   Proved    offenders punishable under Emergency Regulations are then transferred as    soon as possible to permanent Concentration Camps, while  those  against
    whom no charge is proven are normally released.  In some cases they may    be held temporarily for. further periods for work on roads, etc., for security    reasons.  This is  only  done for work of an urgent &quot; security &quot;  nature -    usually to carry out the repair of sabotage and as far as possible the men    so detained are selected from villages believed to have been responsible for    damage.  The only other reason  for which inhabitants are temporarily    detained is for road work, etc., in cases where the rebels  have forbidden    them to work for the Government Forces.    (6) Demolitions.  Much use is being made in propaganda of the demolitionsof houses by troops and the.impression  is being given that wholesale demolition of the houses of innocent Arabs is being Carried out.  This is not the  case.  Inthe great majority of instances individual selected  houses only are  demolishedfor following reasons :        (i)  When they are the property of a known  active rebel leader who  is           absent from his village with  the gangs.     (ii)  Houses from which fire or other resistance has been directed.    (iii)  Houses  in  which arms,  ammunition or equipment  have been con-           concealed or which are proved to have been used for rebel purposes as           Court houses, billets, etc.    Occasionally demolitions are carried out as a collective punishment underthe conditions set forth in the following paragraph.    (c)  Collective Punishments.   Criticism is often, directed at the system of collective punishment but it is probable that the critics fail to realize that theprinciple of the  collective responsibility of a  community for crime  or disordercommitted within its boundaries  is  fully recognized and understood by the palestinian Arab.  There are  many cases where  responsibility for  outrages,particularly sabotage and sniping, can definitely be laid to the door of a certainvillage but information regarding the actual perpetrators is lacking.  Frequentlyit is known that the majority of the inhabitants disapprove  of such crimes butare terrorised by a small rebel element into  condoning them and withholdinginformation from the Government.  Much the same situation arises with terroristcrime in urban areas.  In these circumstances collective punishment is the onlymethod of impressing the peaceful but  terrorised majority that failure to assistlaw and order may in the long run  be  more  unpleasant than submitting to  in-timidation.  There are  only three types of collective punishments employed  inPalestine:        (i)  Collective Fines.  These are not in fact a military measure but are           assessed and imposed  by the Civil Authority, although  at present           military  commanders are   responsible.  Similarly  collection   is           primarily a  Civil  and Police responsibility although in fact military           assistance is frequently invoked.  Collective fines are invariably im-           posed and  usually  collected in cash,  but occasionally  animals or           food  have been seized as security for cash which allegedly cannot           be raised.     (ii)  Collective Demolitions.   Where sabotage  of  road,  rail or  other com-           munications is intensive and frequent,  or land-mines are laid  on           tracks, village responsibility  is involved and the responsibility can as           a rule be clearly established,  although  not against  individuals.  In           some cases the efficacy of collective fines has  been exhausted, there           is no money, and some other deterrent must be applied.  A warning           is therefore given that a repetition will involve demolition and one or           more  houses are  marked, either  of suspected bad characters or  of           village notables  who can,  and should, control the village.  If a           repetition occurs, the marked houses are  demolished.  This collective           deterrent is  usually effective.   Collective, as opposed to individual,           demolitions  are carried out  only  after reference to and sanction  by           Force Headquarters.    t(iii) Curfews.   In urban  areas  an  immediate  and  punitive  curfew  is           frequently  imposed upon a town or quarter  in which a terrorist           crime is committed.  The duration of such curfews rarely exceeds
24 hours.  No comment is needed on this measure, which causes aminimum of personal suffering, but  considerable inconvenience aridinterference with normal life and business.   As this  inconveniencefalls most heavily on the business element who should be the first touphold law and order it is admirably adapted to its purpose.                          4. OTHER DIFFICULTIES    This review of the difficulties of the present situation in Palestine and theMilitary measures taken to deal with them would not be complete without some reference to the further difficulties not directly connected with the rebellion.    (a) The historic associations of Palestine have caused  a  large number of           religious and charitable  institutions  such as monasteries,  hospitals,           schools, etc., to be established in the country. Many of these estab-           lishments are staffed and run by foreign European nationals and most           of  them maintain  close contact with the Arab  population in their           vicinity.  Many institutions under German and  Italian  control are           engaged in anti-Government activities.  They assist in spreading anti-           British and pro-German  and pro-Italian propaganda, they harbour           and assist active rebels, and they encourage the retailing by Arabs of           &quot; atrocity&quot;  stories against the  military which they later  circulate.           The activities  of  other  establishments are  comparatively harmless           although they are no doubt inclined to wink at the  activities of their           particular  Arab clients and  are always  ready  to  protest if  their,           protegees are touched.  In spite of the known activities of the German           and Italian religious houses,  in  order to  avoid  difficulties with the           representatives of those countries, they have shared and will continue           to  share, as  a general  rule,  the immunity from  military  action           accorded to all those  of  other nationalities.  Nevertheless, this for-           bearance definitely handicaps military action to a certain extent.    (b) There are a  number of  Civil German Colonies  which  have  been           established  for many years in the Jaffa and Haifa areas.  These are           almost certainly implicated in  actual assistance to the rebels by           technical advice and by harbourage, and are centres for the collection           and dissemination of propaganda. They have hitherto enjoyed im-           munity from military action for the same reason as other German           and Italian religious houses.    (c) The attitude of the business community, both British and foreign, is also           far from helpful.   Many of them have lived in Palestine  for years           and are interested, either for business  reasons, or in other ways, in           being in close and friendly contact with the Arabs, while at the same           time they dislike the Jews who are  often  their  business rivals.  In           order to obtain immunity,  a considerable proportion  are known to           have contributed  to rebel funds.  They  resent the  presence of the           Army in the country and its effective action by which they see their           intercourse  with the Arabs hampered, if not forbidden, their friendly           relations  undermined  and  their  means  of  livelihood  possibly           threatened.   They  therefore form, and tend increasingly to form, a           support for  propaganda against the troops.  In doing so they show a           lack of restraint and a readiness to take up, without investigation, any           and every accusation however fantastic, with the underlying idea that           they may thus curb the activities of the forces against the rebellion.                              5. CONCLUSION    It is  realized that  responsible  people do not  believe  the wild storiesof wholesale  destruction and brutality now being  circulated  by interestedpropagandists against  the British forces in Palestine and  the  foregoing para-graphs are not written  with the object of dispelling such beliefs.  I do, however,feel that through ignorance of the real situation in Palestine and of the details ofthe actual  measures now being taken to  deal with it, the present wave of propaganda is producing an uneasy feeling even in British circles that the presentmeasures are perhaps unnecessarily severe.  The object of this paper is therefore
to show that in the conditions now prevailing.in Palestine no other methods thanthose which  are being  employed can overcome the very  great and complexdifficulties confronting the Military Forces in their task of restoring order.  It isrealized that these methods inevitably offer opportunities for exaggerated andlying propaganda.  I hope, however, that the description of  the real facts, as  setforth above, will enable the authorities at home to deal effectively with protestsand complaints against our actions in Palestine and so allow commanders andstaffs to give their whole attention to their immediate  task of suppressing the rebellion in circumstances,  which,  in my  opinion, make the functions of the armed Forces of the Crown one of the  most difficult that  they  may be calledupon to carry out.
