GERMiiN AGGRESSION ^GAINST HOLLAND.                                 Report.             We have teen asked hy the Minister  for  Co-ordination        of Defence to consider and report on  the following questions        as a matter of urgency:-             (l) Whether the integrity of Holland  constitutes so                   vital a strategic interest to this country that                   we should intervene fa the event  of aggression                   hy Germany against Holland.             (2) If the answer to (l) is in the  affirmative,  what                   military action could this country take in defence                   of Holland&apos;s integrity:-                    (a) if Prance and Belgium remain neutral;                    (b) if Prance and Belgium are  our allies.        2.   In this paper we deal only with  question  (l)  referred        to above.    The answers to question  (2)  have formed the subject        of a separate, report &quot;hie h is being circulated to  the  Foreign        Policy Committee of the Cabinet.        3.   We have not thought it necessary to recapitulate in any        detail the views which have previously been  expressed on this        subject.   We think it sufficient to  recall  that  in 1934        it was stated in a Report  by the Chiefs of  Staff to  the        Ministerial Gommi11ee on Disarmament:-                &quot;the integrity of Holland to  our National                    security...........may be said to be                    of the greatest importance,  second only                    to that of Belgium.&quot;                      s paper Ho.

                                            H        In 1936 the Chiefs of Staff reported -          &quot;the integrity of Holland, as of Belgium,             is of vital concern to G-reat Britain&quot;,                                              i        In the 1937 Review of Imperial Defence ,  it was stated -          &quot;A German victory over Prance, or to a lesser             extent the permanent occupation of the Low             Countries, would lead  to a situation from             which a most dangerous threat to the United             Kingdom could develop&quot;.4.      We now proceed to examine the effect, at thepresent time, of the occupation of Holland hy Germany fromthe military point of view;5  Naval Operations,, Prom the naval point  of view Germ any. could useDutch ports for her submarines and  light  forces.,   although these ports would be within striking distance of British airforces, our general inferiority in  air-striking power make sit improbable that any considerable numbers of aircraft could be spared to attack them effectively.   Consequently,German submarines and light craft should be able to make some Use of these bases.   Although our means of counter-attacking submarines when fully developed will be  greaterthan they were;  nevertheless the threat to our sea communications would be increased,  and it might be necessaryto divert all trade from  the port of London.6.      On the other hand, in the last war Rotterdam was themost important neutral port available to Germany,outside theBaltic, for the importation of war  supplies, foodstuffs andraw materials.   The invasion of Holland by Germany would afford us the opportunity of closing this channel byapplication of measures of blockade.    Thus from the&apos;            s   C.I.D.

economic point of view, except in so far as the seiz^^reof stocks would compensate her, the invasion of Hollandwould he disadvantageous to Germany,,  In additionHolland, is far from self-supporting and the maintenanceof the Dutch population would he an added burden toGermanyo7-7     Air Operationsc  From the air point of view,Germany could bring London and certain other importanttargets within reach of her short-range bombers, and thusincrease the weight of her air attack on certain areas.Moreover her crews need not be so highly trained aswhen their only route involved a full crossing of theNorth sea  In addition she might be able to escort herbombers with fighters to the closer objectives inEngland, including London^ which would greatly increasethe difficulties of our own fighters0  Once Germany had entered Holland, the further west she went the greater the depth she would obtain for her air defence at theexpense of our own.80     On balance, therefore, the occupation of Hollandwould be of advantage to Germany-from the air point ofview..  We do not think it likely, however, that thiswould in itself be enough to turn the scale against us.                          -9*     Land Operations0    J  Germany was established in holland, this would facilitate an attack on Belgiumfrom the North and East simultaneously.  SubsequentlyGermany could quickly develop a strong attack on the franco-Belgian frontier and the threat to the security ofFrance would be increasedo
10.    In the European theatre,  therefore,  theoccupation of Holland by Germany would be to our strategic disadvantage by sea,  in the air and on land,. 11,    Turning now to the Far East the integrity of the Dutch East Indies is of importance to the security of our strategic position there *  Should the British Empire become involved in war with Japan we should hope to be able to count, at least, on the benevolent neutrality of the Dutch East Indies and on their resistance to Japanese aggression0  The invasion of Holland by Germany would imperil the continued existence of the Dutch East Indies under Dutch sovereignty and consequently would render-, them more liable to Japanese aggression,.  It follows that the invasion of Holland would have direct and serious repercussions on our position in the Par East,CONCLUSIONS,12,    Prom the preceding paragraphs it will be seenthat if Germany occupied Holland, we should be placed ata considerable strategic disadvantage if Germanysubsequently attacked Great Britain,  There is also theimportant consideration that failure to intervene wouldhave such moral and other repercussions as would seriouslyundermine our position in the eyes of the Dominions andof the world in general which might deprive us of support in the subsequent struggle between Germany and theBritish Empire0  On purely strategical grounds, therefore,we have reached the conclusion that, if our defensive
preparations were reasonably complete, we should haveno doubt in advising that the integrity of Hollandconstitutes so vital a strategical interest to thiscountry that we should intervene in the event of aggression by Germany against Holland.  The only doubt in our mind arises from the present stx^ength of our defensive preparationsa       Consequently, we do not feel in a position tosubmit a definite recommendation in favour of interventionuntil we have considered what action we could take inpresent circumstances.  This matter will be dealt within our Second Report, in accordance with question (2)of our terms of-reference, which will be submitted.to-morrow, Wednesday, 25th January,                           (Signed) C.L.N.
