This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.47SECRET.CP. 6(23).Copy No.-.; oi oTHE CABINET.ADEN.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.From the military point of view it is most desirable to secure an early decision as to     0164 the control of Aden, referred to by the Colonial Secretary in his memorandum CP. 4347.     5480 Many questions are outstanding, which cannot be settled satisfactorily in the meantime, such as the revision of the Defence Scheme and the suggested removal of the barracks to a new site ; and the General Officer Commanding, who is also the Resident, is at present serving three masters : -(1) The Commander-in-Chief in India who is responsible for administration ;(2) The War Office, responsible for defence ; and(3) The Colonial Office, in charge of policy and external relations.The General Staff are of opinion that Imperial strategic interests will best be secured by the transfer of control from India to the Colonial Office. Aden is so important a link in our communications, not only with India, but also with Australia and the Far East, that the Imperial Government appear better placed than the Government of India to gauge its requirements and watch its interests. This is likely to become increasingly the case in the future with the development of the Indian Reform Scheme.But there are financial considerations of some importance involved. Until the end of the 19th century India bore the whole cost of Aden, but at the time when the Imperial Exchequer could afford to be generous it was decided that Army votes should contribute  100.000 a year (roughly, one half of the current military charges) and half the capital outlay on work and armaments.During the war Army Votes paid this peace contribution, together with half the extraordinary war charges, India paying the balance.When, in 1917, it was decided to transfer the military control of Aden to the War Office for the period of the war, on the military ground of unity of control under the conditions then obtaining, the Government of India disclaimed all financial responsibility, but eventually agreed to leave the financial arrangements as they were, with the proviso that, if War Office control continued after the war, or if the control of Aden were definitely taken out of the hands of India, the financial arrangements should be reviewed and possibly retrospective effect given to whatever decision was eventually arrived at. Such a retrospective claim might now amount to a very considerable sum.The future garrison of Aden is not yet settled, but it is anticipated that it will cost, in round figures, about  400,000 a year, exclusive of pension charges. If India were relieved of all share in the cost, the annual charge to us would be about  450,000, including pensions and a loss of about  25,000 on the capitation rate now paid by India to the War Office for &quot; Home Effective Charges.&quot;If the present financial arrangements remained unchanged in principle, and were merely readjusted to the new figures for cost, the annual charge to us would be about  200,000.The amount at stake is therefore substantial, and I desire to make it clear at once that I cannot undertake to find any increased sum out of the limited total assigned to Army Estimates, 1923-24, whether for arrears or for current charges, in the event of the charge for Army expenditure in the Middle East returning to the Army Vote.Subject to this, and to a clear undertaking that the finding of the Committee will be accepted by the Government of India, I agree to the appointment of a Committee, on which the War Office should be represented. ,D.The War Office,13^A January, 1923.(B23/51)   100   1/23   W.O.P.   639
