COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE&quot; AND TERMS OP&apos; REFERENCE.At a meeting on 17th February, 1922, the Cabinet agreed that a Technical Committee, composed as follows : The   Right   Hon.   Sir   Alfred   Mond,   Bart.,   M.P,, (Chairman);The Right Hon. Lord Weir of Eastwood f Sir G. L. Barstow, K.C.B., Treasury; Sir Arthur I. Durrant, C.B.E., M.V.O., Director of Lancia and Accommodation, H.M. Office of Works;.The Right Hon, Lord Eorrbs ;Lieut.-ColOnel The Hon. P\ S. JAcKsok, M.P. ;Major-General Sir P. A. M. Nash, K.C.M.G., OB. ;Lieut.-Colonel Sir j. R. Chancellor, G.C.M.G., D.S.O. (Secretary);Lieut.-Colonel   0.   W.   G.   Walker,   D,S.O. (Assistant Secretary);should be set up at once to make definite proposals for amalgamating as far as possible the common Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force, such as Intelligence, Supply, Transport, Education, Medical, Chaplains, and any other over-lapping Departments, in order to reduce the cost of the present triplication. The Committee should consider each branch separately and submit interim Reports to the Cabinet as soon as possible.* On the 20th October, 1922, Lord Weir was appointed Chairman of the Committee in succession to Sir Alfred Mond, who vacated that office on the resignation of the late Government,
REPORT.We were instructed to make definite proposals for amalga-mating as far as possible the common Services of the Navy, Army aad Air Force, such as Intelligence, Supply, Transport, Education, Medical and Chaplains, and any other overlapping Departments in order to reduce the cost of the present triplication. At an early&apos; stage of our inquiry it became apparent that, if our terms of reference were literally interpreted, we should be precluded from suggesting measures other than amalgamation by which economies could be effected. The point was referred by our Chairman to the Cabinet, who authorised the amendment of our terms-of reference so as to enable us : &quot; to make definite proposals for the amalgamation, or, if this appeared impossible or undesirable, for the co-ordination so far as possible of the common Services of the Navy, Army and Ah Force.&quot;-2. At our first meeting we decided to deal with the following Services : (i) Medical.(ii) Chaplains.(iii) Education.(iv) Intelligence.(v) Supply, (vi) Transport.(vii) recruiting.(viii) Works and Buildings.(ix) Acquisition,. Management and Disposal of Govern -ment Lands.3. Our attention- was subsequently called to the fact that the question of concentrating in one department all Govem--ment purchases and sales of land and buildings and the manage-ment of the. estates of the Crown1 and Government property was being considered by a Committee, of which.Sir Howard Frank was Chairman. We accordingly decided not to examine into the question of the acquisition, management and disposal of Government lands.4. In view of the instructions issued by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the year 1919 to the effect that the Estimates for the three fighting Services were to be built up on the assumption that no great war was to be anticipated within - the next ten years, we have taken the peace, organisation of the Services as the basis of our recommendations.39163
S. We assumed that we should be carrying out the spirit oi our instructions if we proceeded on the principle that under any new organisation that may be set up the responsibility of Ministers for the Sendees administered by them must remain unimpaired,6. After a preliminary discussion, we were disposed to think that by the complete amalgamation of some of the common Services, if practicable, substantial economies could.be effected. Firstly, there would be economy in the common purchase of stores and supplies on account of the reduction of prices that would be obtained by the ordering of larger quantities, better position in markets and avoidance of competition, as well as economy in cost of inspection.Secondly, that there would be economy of management : for it is primA facie unlikely that the same number of superior officers would be required for administrative work for the combined Services as are required for three separate Services :Thirdly, that there would be economy of personnel, for it seemed reasonable to expect that in stations where two or more Services are now employed some reduction of numbers could be effected by amalgamation :Fourthly, that if one Service were being expanded and the other in process of reduction, or if one Service were short of officers of some particular seniority, the greater elasticity of combined Services might enable these difficulties to be met at reduced expenditure : and,Fifthly, that there..would be economy in training facilities.7. -To help us to form an opinion as to the method of procedure we should adopt in pursuing our inquiry, we invited a representa--tive of each of the three Departments concerned to be present at a general and informal discussion of the subject of amalgama-tion, in order that we might learn the views of the Departments as to the practicability of that policy.As the result of the preliminary discussions with representa-fives of the Departments, it became clear to us that many difficulties stood in the way of the amalgamation of the ancillary Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force; and we came to the conclusion that, to enable us to make further progress in our inquiry, and to form an opinion as to the practicability of the policy of amalgamation and as to the savings that might thereby be effected, it was necessary for us to examine in detail and individually each of the common Services.8. We accordingly established sub-committees, with one of our members as Chairman, and with representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, and in the case of some of the Sub-Committees with a representative of the Treasury as members, to report upon each of the more important common Services; The Reports of the Sub-Committees which examined into the Medical, Chaplains, Supply and Works and Buildings Services are printed as Appendices to this Report.
9. After careful consideration we earn el to the conclusion that in existing circumstances the amalgamation of the common Services of the three Departments is not advisable; and we doubt if any substantial economies would thereby be effected. The different conditions under which the three Services work, the different duties assigned to them, and the distribution of the armed forces of the Crown in small bodies all over the world alike constitute serious obstacles to the amalga-relation of their common Services.10. We are of opinion that the amalgamation of the common Services would only be practicable if it formed part of a compre-hensive scheme of reorganisation which provided for the establish-ment of a Ministry to control a defence force in which the identity of the Navy, Army and Air Force had been merged. So far as we are aware, such a revolutionary idea as the merging of the identity of the three Services in one force has never been contemplated. But unless such a Ministry is created, we are unable to devise means by which responsibility can be allocated as between the authority charged with the administration of an amalgamated common service and the Ministers who are severally responsible&apos; to Parliament for the administration of the Navy, Army and Air Force.11. We are, nevertheless, impressed with the need for^estab-lishing closer relations between the three Services in order to ensure co-operation, the free interchange of information on all matters of common interest and the use by each t department of the facilities and services provided by the others in cases where economies can thereby be effected,12. In order to promote co-operation between the Services we have recommended the establishment of technical Inter-departmental Committees to co-ordinate the work of some of the common Services. We are aware that steps have already been taken in this direction. In accordance with the Cabinet decision of 23rd March, 1920, the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee Was established to ensure co-operation between the Contracts branches of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry; and as the result of an inter-departmental enquiry into the hospitals of the Navy and Army, substantial economies have been effected.13. We are not, however, satisfied that the need for close . co-operation between the three Services in administrative matters is fully appreciated by those concerned ; and we have had evidence to show that Departments are in some cases reluctant to make use of the services of another Department, even when it would be economical to do so. It was explained, among other reasons, that the use by one Department of the services of another leads to difficulties of. accounting. We suggest the attention of the Treasury be drawn to those difficulties with a view to their removal if practicable.
14. It is important that measures should be devised to ensure that these co-ordinating Committees, after they have been con-stituted, should be fully and effectively used. We were in some difficulty as to how that object could be achieved. We suggest that the proper functioning of each of the proposed Committees, and the existing Contracts Co-ordinating Committee, should be regarded as a special responsibility of the heads of the branches in the three departments dealing with the Service in question; and that each Committee should furnish an annual report upon its work for submission to the Secretaries of . State and to the Treasury.15. The object of our enquiry was to effect economies in the common Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force; and there was an assumption that large economies could be achieved by the amalgamation, of those Services. In all great industrial enterprises at the present time, no effort is being spared to effect economies in the costs of production; but in their case more reliance is placed upon detailed investigations and drastic treatment of all channels of expenditure throughout the existing system of organisation than upon revolutionary&quot; changes in that system. Apart from the action indicated in the recommendations which we have made below, we believe that the foregoing method if applied to the Departments of the Services would prove to be fruitful in achieving economies.16. We have not thought it necessary to recapitulate in our main Report the facts and arguments set forth in the Reports of the Sub-Committees, on which the following conclusions andv recommendations are in a large measure based.MEDICAL. SER vTCES,&apos; 17. So long as the Navy, Army and Air Force are under the executive control of separate Ministers, the amalgamation of their Medical Services would involve a division of responsibilities which would impair efficiency to such an extent as to outweigh any economies that might thereby be effected.18. Permanent machinery should, however, be set up to ensure that close co-operation between the three Medical Services is established and maintained.19. Since the. Report of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee on National Expenditure was submitted, steps have been taken by the Medical Departments to prevent overlapping and duplication of services and to provide for&quot; the use by each Service of the&apos; hospital accommodation and other facilities provided by the others at stations where economy can thereby be effected.20. A Joint Committee consisting of the heads of the Medical Departments, together with such other persons as may be nominated by the Admiralty, War Office&quot;, and Air Ministry &quot; should be established. The Committee should meet periodically for the exchange of information and to discuss matters affecting the Medical Services of the three Departments.
21. A representative of the Ministry of Pensions should be associated with that Joint Committee in order to insure that consideration is given to the question of the economical pro-vision of the hospital accommodation required for disabled war pensioners. Full use should be made of the accommodation available, either by the transfer of redundant naval and military hospitals to. the Ministry of Pensions or by the admission of war pensioners indiscriminately to all Naval and Military and Air Force hospitals.22. Important questions of medical policy such as the con-struction of new hospitals, the provision of facilities for common training, and specifications for the supply of medical stores and appliances, and all matters in which economies might .be effected by the co-operation of the three Departments, should be considered by the Joint Committee before individual action is taken by any one Department.23. The policy of introducing a common system of entry and a common entrance examination for candidates for the Medical Departments of the three Services should be examined by the Joint Committee with a view to ascertaining if such an arrange-ment would result in economy, and be more attractive to candidates.24. Recommendations(a) The amalgamation of the Medical Departments of theNavy, Army and Air Force is undesirable.(b) A Joint Committee consisting of the heads of theMedical Departments of the Navy, Army, Air Force and Ministry of Pensions, together with such other persons as may be nominated by those Departments should be established to discuss matters affecting the Medical Services of the four Departments.(c) The terms of reference-of the Committee should be : To advise upon : -(i) important questions of medical policy suchas the construction of new hospitals;(ii) the  provision  of  facilities  for. commontraining;(iii) specifications for the supply of medical stores and appliances;(iv) the use of Navy, Army-and Air Forcehospitals for the accommodation of dis-abled war pensioners; and (v) all matters in respect of which economies might be effected by the co-operation of the four Departments.
CHAPLAINS&apos; SERVICES.25. No economy in. personnel or expenditure would be effected by the amalgamation of the Chaplains&apos; Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force into one Department common to all three Services.26. Some economy can be effected by close co-operation between the three Services ; and permanent machinery should be set up to ensure that the Chaplains&apos; Departments keep in close and constant touch with one another.27. In stations where the spiritual needs of the three Services can be ministered to by a Chaplain belonging to one of the Services the duplication of Chaplains&apos; appointments should be avoided; and where such an arrangement would be economical and convenient, local clergymen should be employed.28. Recommendations: (a) The amalgamation of the Chaplains&apos; Departments of theNavy, Army and Air Force is undesirable.  .(b) A Joint Committee, composed of the heads of theChaplains&apos; Departments, together with such other persons as may be nominated by the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry should be set up. The Com-mittee should meet periodically to discuss, matters of common interest from the point of view of economy.EDUCATIONAL SERVICES.29. Owing to the fact that specialised technical instruction forms a large part of the curriculum in each of the colleges for cadets and young officers of the three Services, the amalgamation of those establishments is not practicable.30. We have not considered the question of the establishment of a Joint Staff College for the three Services, as we are informed that that subject is being investigated by another Committee.31. At first sight, the amalgamation of certain technical schools, such as Musketry, Gunnery, Signalling, and Gas schools, would appear to present some advantages. Modern war material is, however, so complex and specialisation in the use of modern weapons is carried to such a pitch that we are advised that even in musketry and gunnery it would not be practicable to have courses of instruction common to the three Services.32. The existing. Naval schools of technical instruction are situated in the neighbourhood of the Home Ports, an arrange-ment which is at once Economical and convenient. By locating those establishments in close proximity to the Naval depots where large numbers of men are constantly undergoing training,
the provision of separate barrack accommodation for men attend-ing the technicarschools is rendered unnecessary.33. The establishment of central schools of instruction for the Navy alone would not lead to any saving; for it would entail the construction of additional barrack and other accommodation. Centralisation would further involve increased charges for travelling and lodging allowances and would tend to deprive the schools of the present flexibility of organisation which enables parties of officers and men from ships arriving in their Home Ports for a short stay and at short notice to take advantage of the facilities afforded by the local establishments.34. The above observations apply, although in a lesser degree, to the technical schools of the Army and Air Force. In the circumstances we are of opinion that the centralisation of tho schools of instruction would be uneconomical and administratively inconvenient.35. We observe that there is a tendency to set up separate technical schools for instruction in the use of each new weapon or scientific appliance that is introduced into the Services. We think this practice has been carried to excess, and we recommend that in the interests of economy existing establishments should as far as possible be made- use of; new classes being added to them as and when necessary for the study of new weapons and appliances.36. Recommendations;-^(a) The amalgamation of the technical schools of the Navy,Army, and Air Force is inadvisable.(b) Instead of setting up new schools for the study of new weapons and appliances, existing establishments should as far as possible be made use of; new classes being added to them as and when necessary.(c) A Joint Committee consisting of representatives of the&apos;Educational Branches of the Navy, Army and Air Force, together with a representative of the Board of Education should be set up to consider and advise on educational matters affecting the three Services.INTELLIGENCE SEBVICES.37. The information required by each of the three Services differs in many respects and is, as a rule, of so technical a character that the employment of officers of each of the three Services on intelligence work is necessary. So far as we have been able to ascertain, there is no serious overlapping or duplication-tion in the activities of the Intelligence Departments of the three Services.38. The Intelligence Departments of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry now maintain close touch with one another in order tp ensure constant interchange of information and to prevent duplication. In these circumsta.nce.s, we .do not consider that efficiency would be promoted or that any substantial saving
would be effected! by the amalgamation of the Intelligence1 Branches of the Navy, Army and Air Force.39&apos;. In view of our terms of reference, we have not examined into the larger&apos; question of the co-ordination of the services maintained by other Departments of State for the collection of political intelligence, statistical information in connection with trade and shipping, and the security services maintained by the Police and Fighting Departments. We suggest that the question might with advantage be examined by an Inter-Departmental Committee on which all the Departments concerned should be represented with a view to securing eco-? nomical administration&apos; and the prevention of duplication of work. 40.&apos;Recommendations &apos;;-(d) The amalgamation of the Intelligence&apos; Branches of theisfavy, Army and Air Force is inadvisible. (b) An Interdepartmental Committee should be set up, on which all the Departments.of State concerned should be represented, to inquire into the question of the co-ordination, of the services maintained for the collec-tioH of political intelligence and information connected with tradei, shipping and the security services with a view to preventing duplication.StOPPLY SERVICES,41. The complete amalgamation of the Supply Departments&apos; Of the three Services into a central Amalgamated Supply Service, would diminish the efficiency of supply of the individual fighting Services/ and would not be warranted unless&apos; associated with the complete amalgamation of all three fighting Services into a force, in which their individual characteristics had been merged,42. The establishment of a general pool of common stores to meet the needs of all three Services is impracticable, owing to differences in the needs of the three Services and in their organisation and geographical distribution.43. 1&apos;t is essential in the interests of economy that there should so far as practicable&apos; be coordination of design, pattern and specification of stores and commodities required by file three Services, other than those of a highly technical nature.44. Amalgamation of the technical branches and inspection branches is in existing&quot; circumstances impracticable.45. The cost of the requisitioning, accounting and contracting branches of the Supply Departments of tile three Services is so small actually and relatively, that even if triplication does exist, the&apos; amalgamation of these branches on the ground of economy jn establishments alone would hardly be warranted; nor would amalgamation of these branches be justified in regard to the stores and supplies not of a highly technical character, that&apos; ia to say, intermediate stores and common stores.
46. The constitution of a central Contracts Department for the purchase of selected stores and commodities would not result in anjr substantial economy in establishments; and we do not con-sider it is warranted on other grounds in view of its disadvantages.47. The greatest freedom and encouragement should be given by the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry to their Supply Departments and to the Contract, Technical or other Co-ordinating Committees for the interchange of data&quot; and informa-tion in regard to all supply questions. In particular the extension of the agency system of supply, whereby one department purchases stores or commodities for another department., should be investigated and encouraged.48. The Contracts Co-ordinating Committee being mainly concerned with the contract aspect of supply is. limited in its usefulness. Co-ordination and, so far as practicable, unification, of technical design and pattern is equally important and should receive close and detailed treatment to ensure its fullest realisation in practice,49. Recommendations((^Amalgamation of the supply branches of the three fighting Services or of any sections of those branches is not warranted in present circumstances.(b) Five Technical Co-ordinating Committees should beappointed to meet at definite intervals to deal with : (i) Foodstuffs,(ii) Clothing and textiles,(iii) Mechanical transport,(iv) General stores,(v) Medical and veterinary stores.(c) Special Sub-Committees of those Committees should beappointed-to conduct detailed investigation with regard to particular items of supply. W) The terms of reference of those Technical Co-ordinating Committees should be     . To consider : : (i) The  adoption,  wherever possible,  of trade standards or patterns for commodities and stores common to and in use by the three Services.(ii) The standardisation, wherever practicable, of the specification and design of commodities and stores common to and in use by the three Services for which a trade pattern is unsuitable.(iii) The co-ordination- of the methods and pro-cedure of inspection. 7 &apos;(e) The Technical Co-ordinating Committees should be com-posed of one or more representatives for each Com-mittee from each Service, who should be technical officers of rank and experience with a knowledge of Service practice. &quot;- 39463 b 2
In cases where other Government Departments are large purchasers of similar stores, representatives from those&apos; Departments should be . added as associate members.if) -A business main of repute and standing, chosen from a panel selected by the Federation of British Industries or other representative organisation or from the associate members of the existing War Office Tech-iiical Committees, should be associated with each of the new Committees.(g) The attention of the Contracts Co-ordinating Committeeshould be drawn to the Technical, Co-ordinating Com-mittees the establishment 6f which is recommended above, and they should refer to those committees all suggestions for co-ordination of design and! pattern, and act generally in. consultation with them,(h) The agency system, whereby one Department pur-chases from another stores or -commodities,, which - owing to any combination of circumstances that Government Department is in a better, position than the other to obtain, should be encouraged and developed^ e.g,, the particular case- of furniture sup-plied by the Office of Works should receive immediate-investigation by the appropriate Technical Co-ordination --ing Committee&apos;.(i) The Treasury should investigate the financial clifli-culties which at present prevent a full use being made&apos; by Departments of the agency system.TRANSPORT SERVICES.50. Supply and Transport are closely related, and the dividing, line between those Services in the Navy, Army and Air Force is difficult to define. In our investigation into tho supply Ser-vices we necessarily touched upon transport;. and our remarks on the Supply Departments apply in a large measure to the Transport Departments.51. When sea transport is required by the Military or Air&apos; Forces, the Military and Air Force authorities notify the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade of their requirements; and that -Department provides the necessary shipping. When the Admiralty require passages for naval personnel by private ships, they also make use of the services of the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade. There is thus no duplication as regards sea transport, the Service&apos; being in fact a common one under the control of the Board of Trade.52. When the Naval, Military and Air Force authorities desire to moveiroops by rail, they notify the railway company concerned of their requirements, and the accommodation required is pro-vided by the company.
u53. Horse transport is used by the Army only, and no questioil of amalgamation arises in respect of this branch of transport.54. It is thus only in respect of mechanical transport that there may he duplication of Services and establishments. We addressed to each of the Departments a questionnaire asking for details of their mechanical transport, and in the case of the War Office for information regarding their horse transport. The questionnaire and the replies to it are printed as Appendix V. to this Report.55. The Admiralty Mechanical Transport Service is centrally controlled from London, this system having been introduced hi lieu of the previous arrangement under which each Sub-Depart-&apos; ment maintained its own transport. The decentralised system was found to be extravagant in operation as weli as in the matter of reserves. Most of the work of the naval mechanical transport is carried on in.the dockyards, and considerable economies in the handling of stores and materials have been effected by its use.56. The Mechanical Transport Services for the Military and Air Forces are and must be so organised as to be capable of rapid expansion on mobilisation. The ratio of the peace establishment to the war establishment is a question of policy, which does not fall within our terms of reference, and we can only consider whether there is duplication in the peace establishments,57. In the case of the Army mechanical transport service a cadre establishment is maintained in time of peace for the number of mechanical transport service companies required to complete the war establishment &apos;of the Expeditionary Force. On mobilisation those cadres are expanded to war establishment. The peace cadres are so organised as to provide as large a. pro-portion as possible of the peace-time road transport requirements of the Army, the balance being provided by the hire of private vehicles.Each mechanical transport company is so organised as to be able to carry out minor repairs. Major repairs and overhauls are carried out either by contract or at the Repair Depot at Hounslpw. The chief function of this Repair Dep6t is to provide a training school for all ranks in the heavier work which would have to be undertaken in the base repair shops in tirne of war. Iii addition, a, portion of normal heavy repairs for the Army and special work of aft urgent nature are carried out there in time of peace.58. The Mechanical Transport of the Air Force has an organisation on a unit basis, which is expanded on mobilisation to meet war requirements. There is also an establishment on a station basis to meet .the requirements of immobile units such as store depots.&apos; As in the case of the&apos; Army minor repairs are.carried out by the local mechanical transport unit. Major repairs and overhauls are carried out at the repair depot at. Shrewsbury. The Air Ministry lay considerable emphasis on the need for maintaining a separate repair depot as a training establishment for mechanics, and to provide a pool from which expert mechanics can be drawn for reliefs in the normal course.
59. From the evidence which we have heard we do not con-sider that there is&apos; any overlapping in the work of the repair depots; for although the chief function of.the depot in the case of each Force is that of a training establishment, each depot is kept fully employed with the heavy repairs of the vehicles of its own Service.60. It.has been suggested to us that the Air Force Mechanical Transport should be absorbed in the Army Mechanical Transport Service. That suggestion must be considered in connection with the geographical distribution of the stations and units of the Army and Air Force. At Air Force stations where no military units are quartered it would be necessary either to main-tain a detachment of Army transport for which the same facili-ties and accommodation must be provided as would be required for a detachment of Air Force transport, or to hire private trans-port. By neither arrangement does it appear to us that economy or efficiency would be promoted., The suggestion that the Army and Air Force Transport Sendees should be amalgamated does not therefore commend itself to us.61. Definite economies might be effected in some places by arranging for transport for stationary air units to be supplied from the local units of Army mechanical transport; and at places where both Naval and Military mechanical transport establishments are maintained it might similarly be economical for one of the Services to supply the mechanical transport needs of both Services.62. In deciding which Service should retain its transport estab-lishment, due weight must be given to the consideration that the peace establishment of the Army mechanical transport is the cadre from which the war transport organisation of an army in the field is developed. Naval mechanical transport, on the other hand, exists-pnly for the use of the dockyards and other establisb-ments the requirements of which could in case of need be met by hired transport. It will therefore usually be expedient to pre-serve the Army mechanical transport establishment and to enlarge it if necessary to enable it to serve the Naval establishments and the stationary units,of the Air Force.63. It is suggested, for example, that the Naval mechanical transport establishment now maintained in London might be abolished and that the Admiralty should draw upon the Army mechanical transport units in London. Similarly it may be found economical at Malta, the military garrison of which is regarded in some-measure as a reserve for the troops in Egypt and the Middle East, to increase the military mechanical trans-port establishment so as to enable it to provide for requirements of the Dockyard and other Naval establishments.64. We do not recommend the establishment of a standing inter-departmental on the transpbrt services; but we suggest that the question of pooling the mechanical transport of the three Services at certain stations should be enquired into by an ad hoc committee composed of representatives of the Admiralty, WaP Office and Air Ministry. , &apos;  ,
85. Recommendations^(a) The amalgamation of the transport services of the Navy,Army and Air Force is impracticable;(b) The absorption of the mechanical transport of mobileunits of the Air Force into the Army Mechanical Transport Service is inadvisable;(c) An ad hoc Committee composed of representatives ofthe Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry should be appointed to inquire into the question of the ex-pediency of arranging for provision by one of&apos;&apos;the - Services of the mechanical transport requirements of the others at certain stations;RECRUITING SERVICES;66. The Navy, Army and Air Force &quot;in the main, draw their recruits from different classes of the population at different., ages, and the educational and physical standards required in each Service are different.67. In the Navy all the seamen class are recruited as boys; A considerable number of recruits of a higher age are enlisted for service as stokers and artificers and trained in their duties after joining the Navy. Only ten recruiting stations are maintained under the Admiralty Recruiting Service, and the total cost of the NavalRecruiting Service is relatively small.68; The recruiting organisation of the Army is administered by the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief of the Commands. The Commands are divided into recruiting zones each of which , in addition to furnishing recruits for the local infantry regiment and for the militia, recruits for the Army generally. To each recruiting zone a retired officer is appointed for recruiting duties. He is assisted by a number of paid pensioner recruiters who form his permanent recruiting staff. The Regular personnel allotted to infantry depots, Militia units and the Territorial Army are also required to assist the recruiting staff so far as is consistent with the obligations imposed on them by their other duties. The Army Recruiting Service is thus inextricably interwoven with the Terri-torial system which is the basis of Army organisation in the United Kingdom.69. Over one-half of the establishment of the Air Force.consists of mechanics of the long apprenticeship trades, who are enlisted as boys and undergo a five years&apos; course of training after joining the Service. Only three recruiting offices are maintained for the Air Force in London, Birmingham and Glasgow. The cost of the Service is undoubtedly high for the number of recruits engaged, but the. excessive cost is due to the fact that only Candidates who attain the highest standards are accepted. To secure the requisite number of suitable recruits,&quot;it is necessary to examine a large number of candidates. We were informed, for example, that out of 22,000 candidates interviewed in 192f, only 810 were finally accepted.
70. The success of the Recruiting Service depends mainly upon the personal efforts of the individual recruiters. For that reason it will always be necessary to employ Naval recruiters to recruit for the Navy, Army recruiters to recruit for the Army, and Air Force recruiters to recruit for the Air Force. An amalgamation of these three elements to form a combined Recruiting Service would almost inevitably cause friction and loss of efficiency. Having regard to the different conditions of recruiting for tho three Services, no substantial reduction of staff is to be anticipated from amalgamation. We are, therefore, of opinion that the amalgamation of the Recruiting Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force would not be to the advantage of the Services or productive of economy,71. In the course of our enquiry it was brought to our notice that at certain stations civilian doctors are employed to conduct the medical examination of recruits of one of the . Services although a medical officer of one of the other Services may be available at the station. We recommend that steps should be taken to ensure that the services of a recruiting medical officer at any station should be made available, if required, for the examination of recruits for each of the three Services in that locality.73. Recommendations: The amalgamation of the recruiting Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force is undesirable.WORKS  SERVICES.73. In examining the possibility of amalgamating the Works Branches of. the Navy, Army and Ah Force it became apparent at the outset that if such a policy were decided upon the amalgamation should proceed rather by the merging of the Works branches of the three fighting Services in His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works than by the setting up of a new Department,74. A large proportion of the building and engineering work carried out by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry is of a highly technical character, which cannot be handed over to the Office of Works; it would therefore be impossible completely to merge in the Office of Works the whole of the Works Branches of the three fighting Services.75, Partial amalgamation of the Works Branches with the Office of Works would lead to complications which would tend to increase the administrative difficulties of the fighting Depart-ments. It would cause an increase in the staff of the Office of Works which would not be balanced by corresponding reductions in the staffs of the Works Branches of the three Services owing to the necessity for retaining engineering staffs in each Service to deal with technical work.76. The Building Works Services of the War Office are manned by the Boyal Engineers. The officers employed on those duties are part of the military organisation that would be required in time of war, and a considerable part of their time is occupiecj
with military training and duties. The home establishment of the Royal Engineers in-peace is&apos; based upon the numbers required to provide reliefs for garrisons abroad and to complete the war establishments, of units. Even if the building work was trans-ferred to another Department, the existing peace establishment of Royal. Engineers officers must be maintained.77. The above reasons against partial amalgamation are reinforced by the consideration that approximately one half of the total expenditure of the Navy, Army and Air Force on works and buildings is incurred on works and services abroad. The constant changes in the distribution and establishments of the Crown Forces abroad require a flexibility of organization which can more readily be provided under the existing system than would be possible under the Office of Works, which is mainly concerned with works and buildings in the United Kingdom.78. It is desirable that close ^ind constant touch should be maintained between the Works Branches of the three Ser-vices and His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, with the object of ensuring uniformity of procedure in respect of contracts, supply of stores for structural work, &amp;c, and in order that the interests and convenience of all the Departments may be studied when large programmes of work are undertaken by one of them.79. The resources of each Department in respect of special technical matters for which it maintains an expert staff for example, architectural treatment, sanitation, coast protection, dock work, &amp;c. should be placed at the disposal of the other Government Departments when required.80. The system of utilising other works Branches, includ-ing the Works Departments of Colonial Governments, to act as agents for the execution of works in places where this method could be conveniently and economically employed should be developed.81. Before large building schemes in the United Kingdom are undertaken by Government Departments, especially when the construction of buildings of architectural importance are involved, an investigation should take place with a view to ascertaining whether it would not be advantageous to entrust the execution of such schemes to the Office of Works, which possesses a staff of skilled architects.82. To ensure close and constant co-operation between the Government Works Branches and for the carrying out of the various measures we have suggested above, werecommend thai a Joint Committee composed of representatives of the Works Branches of the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and H.M. Office of Works be set up.S3. The Office of Works is responsible for the provision of accommodation for the Civil Service and possesses an expert staff solely engaged on the appropriation and economical utilisation of accommodation.   In our opinion the fullest co-operation in this384630
matter should be established and maintained between the Service Departments and the Office of Works. We.recommend that a special joint Committee be set up composed of representatives of the Service Departments and the Office of Works hi order to secure such co-operation and to ensure that&apos; none of the Departments shall hold accommodation in excess of its requirements,84.

.. EEPOET.1. At the outset of our deliberations it became evident that the scope of our inquiry was divided into two main items (a) Complete amalgamation.(b) Co-ordination.We therefore proceeded to consider each of these items in turn.COMPLETE AMALGAMATION.     .2. In the first instance we considered the feasibility of the amalgamation of all three Medical Services into one common Service.It was pointed out both by the representatives of the Admiralty and the War Office that complete amalgamation between the Naval Medical Service and the Army Medical Service would be impracticable. It was explained that apart from the actual practice of medicine and surgery, the organisation and training necessary for a Naval doctor differed materially from that required in the case of an Army doctor. .The duties of a Naval doctor are principally in connection with ships, and his work is usually carried out in confined spaces. Naval hygiene is a special subject, in which the question of ventilation forms an important part.The Army doctor, on the other hand, receives an elaborate training in administrative duties to prepare him for work in the field, such as camp sanitation, the evacuation of sick and wounded, the lines of supply, in addition to receiving instruction in drill, discipline, and the study of Army Eegulations, all of which subjects would be of no value in the training of a Naval doctor.The training of the personnel of the Eoyal Army Medical Corps during peace time, in preparation for war, is long and arduous. The officer has his time very fully occupied in perfect-ing himself by study and training in the above subjects, in order that he may be fitted for service in a modern highly-organised Army. The additional study of those problems which are peculiar to the Navy would result in all round loss of efficiency.The Eoyal Army Medical Corps is organised to be as much a part of the Army as are the combatant arms. It must train with them, work with them, and be specially organised to treat, transport and evacuate the sick and wounded in war time.All these arguments, which have been given from the point of view of the Army, are also true, although perhaps to a lesser degree, in the case of the Navy.3. The complete amalgamation of the Medical Services would not necessarily result in large savings. As long as the three Services are separately administered, each Service would insist, in the interests of its own efficiency, in maintaining a smah, establishment of high rank in its organisation to deal with
medical matters which cannot be separated from the general administration of the different Services. Under existing con-ditions, whereby the three Services are separately administered, the Committee are of opinion that there would be very little, . if any, actual economy by amalgamation of the three Medical Departments into one common Service. In any case, such a course would radically disturb, the existing organisation of the Medical Departments, which might result in impaired efficiency. Any economy consequent upon the adoption of this course would not justify such a risk.FORMATION OF A SEA SERVICE AND A LAND SERVICE.4. We next proceeded to consider the possibility of the creation of two Medical Services, one for service only at sea, and the other for service on land, but it was pointed out that it would be impossible to retain an officer permanently serving at sea for the whole of his service. Such conditions would render the Service unpopular, and there would be little likelihood of obtain-ing a sufficient number of entrants. In addition, if an officer served continuously at sea he would lose touch with the develop-ments of medical science, and would rapidly become completely out of date.It was suggested that a scheme of short service commissions would meet this difficulty, but it was explained that such a system would not provide any officers of experience suitable for appointment to the essential administrative posts, nor would it provide the requisite senior officers.In view of these arguments we do not recommend the creation of two Medical Services, the one for sea service and the other for land service.AMALGAMATION OF ARMY MEDICAL SERVICE WITH AIR FORCE MEDICAL SERVICE.5. We next considered the question of the amalgamation of the Medical Services of the Army and Air Force, and it was sug-gested that such amalgamation might be carried out by absorbing the Royal Air Force Medical Service into the Royal Army Medical Corps.The reductions in personnel, however, if such a scheme were adopted, would not appear to be great, for it is evident that the Air Force hospitals at Halton and Cranwell must be retained as there are no Military or Naval hospitals within many miles of these places.Furthermore, it is already the practice for the sick of the Royal Air Force to be admitted to Naval and Military hospitals wherever these exist in reasonable proximity to Air Force stations.39i63
The Air Force do not at present maintain a Beparate Dental Service, but are dependent upon the Army Dental Service for their requirements in this respect.6. The initial training of the Royal Air Force Medical Officers, with the exception of the special course at Hampstead, and the whole of the training of the Royal Air Force other ranks, is already carried out by the Royal Army Medical Corps.7. The Royal Air Force insist that in the interests of efficiency it is necessary to retain a small Headquarter Medical Staff at the Air Ministry under an officer of some seniority. Questions arise almost daily for decision by the Air Staff, in which it is necessary to take into consideration the medical aspect of the case. It would be highly inconvenient to refer all such cases to the War Office before a decision could be arrived at and would, in our opinion, result in delay and loss of efficiency.8. Again, the Air Force Commands do not coincide with the Army Commands. If the Medical Staffs at the Air Force Area Headquarters were abolished it would necessitate the Air Officer Commanding referring all medical questions to several Army Commands.9. The question of pay of the two Services would require adjustment. The Medical Officers of the Royal Air Force receive slightly higher grade pay in the junior ranks than those of the Royal Army Medical Corps to cover flying risk. The other ranks of the Royal Air Force, on the other hand, receive, on the whole, less pay than the other ranks of the Royal Army Medical Corps. These differences in pay would require adjustment, and, in our opinion, would involve increased expenditure.10. The Air Council are responsible for formulating the policy for the employment and training of Air Force units, and medical questions are frequently an integral part of such policy. - We are of opinion that the removal from the Air Council of the control over and responsibility for. the Medical Service, resultant upon the absorption of the Royal Air Force Medical Services by the Royal Army Medical Corps, would result in loss of touch and, in consequence, loss of efficiency.11. We are assured that in the event of the Air Force taking part in combined operations with the Navy or Army it is not the intention: of the Air Force to duplicate any portions of the Medical Service, such as the transportation of sick and wounded, the establishment of base hospitals, &amp;c., which are already main-tained by the Service with which the Air Force may be operating.12. We are doubtful if any material saving would be effected by such amalgamation, and are in fact inclined to think that it would lead to increased expenditure, and for the reasons which have been set forth above we do not recommend the amalgamation of the Medical Services of the Army&apos;and Air Force.
CO-ORDINATION.13. We have examined the possibility of co-ordination between the three Services. We.are informed that since the report of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee on National Expenditure considerable progress has already been made in co-operation between the Navy and Army with regard to hospital accommodation. A record of the co-ordination which has already taken place is given in the Appendices to this Report.With regard to the Air Force, co-ordination with the Navy and Army has existed from the inception of the Force in respect to hospital accommodation.With the exception of the hospitals at Iialton, Cranwell and Finchley, which must be retained for the reasons mentioned in paragraph 5, practically all the sick of the Royal Air Force are treated in Naval and Military hospitals.14. We are advised that all possible steps have already been taken to co-ordinate the hospital accommodation of the three Services, and that there remains little scope for further co-ordination in the immediate future.CONSTITUTION OF PERMANENT MACHINERY TO EXAMINE/THE POSSIBILITY OF CO-ORDINATION IN THE FUTURE.15. We are of the opinion that close co-operation and collaboration between the Medical Departments of the three Services is essential in the future. For the purpose of keeping such collaboration constantly under review we recommend the constitution of permanent machinery for the purpose of examining the various directions in which further co-ordination is possible.-16. We suggest that such an object might be attained by meetings at stated intervals between the heads of the medical brandies of the three &quot;Services, together with such other repre-sentatives as may be nominated by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.Questions such as the creation of new hospitals, the facilities for common training, the specification and supply of medical stores and appliances, and other items in which economies might be effected by co-ordination, should be considered by this body before individual action is taken by any one Department.17. We suggest that the question of a common system of entry and the advisability of prospective candidates for&apos; the various Services competing at the same examination should also be examined by this body with a view to ascertaining if such procedure would result in economy.
SUMMARY OP RECOMMENDATIONS.ID We do not recommend the amalgamation of the Medical Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force into one Medical Department common to all three Services.We recognise that such amalgamation would un-doubtedly result in some economy, but are convinced that as long as the three Services are separately administered the disadvantages which would result would impair the efficiency of the various Services to such an extent as to outweigh any possible advantages which might be gained in matters of economy.(2) We consider that considerable economy has been effected already. with regard to the co-ordination of hospital accommodation.We are not&apos; able to state the exact amount of saving which has been made by such co-ordination, but are informed that the resultant economies will be con-siderable both in expenditure and personnel.(3) We recommend that permanent machinery should be immediately set up either on the lines which we have suggested in paragraphs 15 and 16 of this Report, or in some other form which may be considered more suitable, in order that the fullest opportunity may be taken to effect further co-ordination between the three Medical Services whenever opportunities may \ occur in the future.(Signed)     P.

The approximate saving in pay of personnel was  6,809.It has been agreed that the Naval sick at Gibraltar should be treated in the Military hospital at that station and so enable the Naval hospital to be closed. The matter has now been referred to the Genera] Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Gibraltar, m order that details may be arranged.The Naval hospital at Pembroke has been closed and arrange-ments have been made for the Naval patients from Pembroke Dockyard to be treated in the Military hospital.(b) Between the&quot; Royal air Foeoe, the Navy and the Army.Co-operation has existed from the inception of the Air Force.With, the exception of Halton and Cranwell, where Air Ministry hospitals are established, practically all the sick of the Royal Air Force are treated in Military and Naval hospitals.In 1921, 2,726 Royal Air Force patients were treated in Mili-tary and 206 in Naval hospitals.The initial training of Royal Air Force medical officers, with the exception of the special &quot; Air &quot; course at Hampstead, and all the training of the Ro3ral Air Force other ranks is carried out by the Royal Army Medical Corps at the Royal Army Medical College and at Aldershot. This, of course, does not refer to technical training, e.g., actual flying.(a) Between Army and Navy.

APPENDIX II.REPORT OP THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE AMALGA-MATION OE THE &quot;CHAPLAINS&apos; DEPARTMENTS.Teems of Reference and Composition of Committee.At their sixth Meeting, held on 3rd May, 1922, the Committee on the Amalgamation of Services Common to the Navy, Army and Air Force decided : (a) That Sub-Committees of the Committee be set up to. study each of the common ancillary Services indi-individually, and to report as to the practicability of amalgamation and as to the savings that could thereby be effected.(b) That a member of the Committee should preside overeach Sub-Committee, and that the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry should appoint representatives of their Departments to be members of each Sub-Committee.The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee were as follows :-&quot; To make definite proposals for the amalgamation or, if this appears impossible or undesirable, for the co-ordination so far as possible of the Chaplains&apos; Departments, in order to reduce the cost of the present triplication. In each case the estimated savings in establishments and other particulars to be shown.&quot;The following were appointed members of the Sub-Committee : Sir Philip Nash, K.C.M.G., C.B. (Chairman). Admiralty.Sir Oswyn A. R. Murray, K.C.B. (Permanent Secretary).The Venerable Archdeacon C. W. C. Ingles, D.D., Chaplain of the Fleet.War Office.Sir H. J. Cbebdy, E.C.B., C.V.O. (Joint Secretary). The Rt. Rev.  Bishop&apos;j. Taylor Smith, C.B., C.V.O., Chaplain-General.Air Ministry.Air Vice-Marshal 0. Swann, C.B., O.B.E., Air Member for Personnel.Major L. A. Clemens, O.B.E., M.C. (Secretary).
-33 REPORT.1. From the Terms of Reference laid down for the Sub-Committee it was evident that the scope of our enquiry was divided into two main headings,(a) complete amalgamation,(b) co-ordination. .We have, therefore, considered each of these headings in turn.Complete Amalgamation.2. We have considered the feasibility of the amalgamation of the Chaplains&apos; Departments of the three Services into one common Department, and have examined the views of the responsible heads of these Departments on this question.3. The greatest difficulty which would have to be faced in this respect would appear to be the case of the Naval chaplains.It was pointed out that the conditions under which a Naval chaplain is called upon to work on board ship are entirely different from the conditions under which an Army or Air Force chaplain is required to work on shore. A Naval chaplain&apos;s work is carried out without the possibility of recourse to those aids, such as institutes and recreation rooms, to which an Army or Air Force chaplain is accustomed.Unless a chaplain has voluntarily undertaken to work under the difficult conditions appertaining to the Naval Service, it is improbable that he will make a success of his work.4. The conditions of a Naval chaplain&apos;s ,.work being so different from those which exist on shore, it is most desirable that the head qf the Department who is responsible for the work and to whom the individual chaplain looks for advice and help, should himself be thoroughly &quot;acquainted, by personal experience, with those special conditions.5. It was also pointed out that there are certain differences between the organisation and status of chaplains in the Navy and chaplains in the Army or Air Force. A Naval chaplain, under King&apos;s Regulations, holds no Naval rank, but &quot;retains when afloat the position to which his office would entitle him on shore.&quot;There is no grading of chaplains within the branch and every chaplain carries out his work directly under the Chaplain of the Fleet.A Military-or Air Force chaplain, on the other hand, holds relative rank in his Service, and there are various &quot; classes &quot; of chaplains in the Army.If, therefore, a Military or Air Force chaplain holding, for instance, the relative rank of major or squadron leader in his respective Service was sent to sea, owing to the fact that he held such relative rank, his position would be inferior to that held by a Naval chaplain.39463
6. We consider that a system under which chaplains were posted from a common list and regarded as interchangeable between all three Services would produce men who would be far less conversant with the distinctive traditions and outlook of the different Services, than under the present system whereby a chaplain belongs to and can identify himself with the Navy, Army or Air Force, as the case may be, for the whole of his service.The types of officers and men of the three Services must necessarily be entirely different, and each Service is accustomed to regard matters from a different standpoint. We consider that unless a chaplain is accustomed to dealing with the type of man peculiar to his own Service, his sphere of influence and his power for good will be materially lessened.7. We recognise that the difficulties enumerated in the pre-ceding paragraphs are by no means insuperable, but it is evident to us that if amalgamation were to take place, a common Service could not be expected to carry out its duties with the same measure of efficiency as is now the case with three separate Chaplains&apos; Departments.8. We do not consider that any economy either in personnel or expenditure would result from the amalgamation of the Chaplains&apos; Departments.&apos; It would be necessary to retain a senior chaplain at the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry for the purpose of super-vising the work of the chaplains allotted to the various ships and units, and to organise the posting of chaplains as required.It&apos;would further be necessary to superimpose a Chaplain-in-Chief of the common Service,. with the necessary clerical staff to assist him,, to carry out the duties, of co-ordination, inspection and recruiting.It is extremely doubtful if one man would be able to control with efficiency so large a Service.9. Under existing conditions the cost of the higher administra-tiori is about 3 per cent, of the. total expenditure on the three Departments. We do not consider that the cost of the higher administration would be reduced below that figure if amalgama-tion were to take place.10. The chaplains at present serving in the Navy, Army and Air Force have been engaged with a definite contract and with definite conditions of service.If their existing conditions of&apos; service were to be altered and they were required to transfer to a common Service it would be necessary to grant them compensation for breach of contract.It might alternatively be possible to confine the common Service to new entrants only. This would result in a common Service being maintained in addition to the existing Chaplains&apos; Departments, until all the chaplains serving under the old system had retired.
In our opinion both these alternatives would give rise to additional expenditure.Co-oedlnation.11. At our first meeting we requested the Chaplain-General, the Chaplain of the Fleet and the Chaplain-ih-Chief of the Eoyal Air Force to examine the extent to which co-ordination might be possible between the three Services with regard to chaplains belonging to the Church of England.A statement giving the result of their deliberations is repro-duced as Appendix I to this Report.12. The system of control over chaplains belonging to other denominations varies in the three Services. We therefore attach, as Appendix II, to this Report, a statement which has been prepared, with regard to the possibilities of co-ordination in this direction in the United Kingdom.. 13. It will be seen from tnese Appendices that the extent of possible co-ordination, both with regard to chaplains of the Church of England and also those of other denominations, is not large, but the representatives of the three Services have under-taken to effect further economies in personnel should opportunity arise in the future.14. It must be borne in mind that the location of the various units at a station has an important bearing on this question of co-ordination. It is not possible to transport or to march men long distances for the purpose of attending Divine Service, neither is it possible for one chaplain to serve adequately a number of units if these units are situated in scattered quarters.Constitution of Permanent Machinery to Examine the Possibility of Co-ordination in the Future.15. We are of the opinion that close co-operation and collabOra-tion between the Chaplains&apos; Departments of the three Services is essential in the future. For the purpose of keeping such collaboration constantly under review, we recommend the con-stitution of permanent machinery for the purpose of examining the various directions in which further co-ordination is possible. We suggest that such an object might be attained by meetings at stated intervals between the Heads of the Chaplains&apos; Depart-ments of the three Services, together with such other representa-tives as may be nominated by the Admiralty, War. Office and Air Ministry.. Summary of Recommendations.(1) We do not recommend the amalgamation of the Chaplains&apos; Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force into one Depart-ment common to all three Services.
We do not consider that such amalgamation would result in any economy in personnel or expenditure, and therefore are unable to foresee that any advantage would be gained by disturb-ing the existing organisation.(2) We consider that certain economies can be effected from time to time by co-ordination between the three Services. Such co-ordination will prevent the duplication of chaplains&apos; appoint-ments by the three Services in those stations where it is con-sidered that the work can be efficiently carried out either by a chaplain belonging to one of the Services or by the employment of a part-time officiating clergyman.(3) We recommend that permanent machinery should be-immediately set up, on the lines which we have suggested in paragraph 15 of this Report, in order that the fullest opportunity may be taken to efEect further co-ordination between the three Chaplains&apos; Departments whenever occasion may arise in the future.(Signed)  P.

Shotwick is too far from Chester to admit of any co-ordination.The same Roman Catholic and Wesleyan officiating clergy-men are employed by both Naval and Military Authorities, but the sums involved in the payment for Divine Service for the Naval Ratings at that station are so small (averaging six Roman Catholics and four Wesleyan for&apos; the last sis months)1 that it is not con-sidered that ainy small economies that might sometimes be made at this station by combining the Naval and Military Divine Services would compensate for the additional work and correspondence between Naval and Military Authorities which would be entailed thereby.Roman Catholics. It is not feasible for the Royal Naval i Chaplain to take charge efficiently of all Roman Catholic troops and their families at this station in addition to his present work. The officiating clergyman in charge of Troops could perhaps assist the Royal Naval Chaplain at the Royal Naval Hospital, and perhaps be respon-sible for certain families of the Royal Naval personnel-living outside Royal Naval Barracks as might be mutually arranged between the two Chaplains. This would enable tho Royal Naval Chaplain to carry out the whole of the duties connected with all Royal Naval establishments and ships in the port, thus saving the&apos; additional officiating clergyman (Rev. Father Bolger) for Royal Naval Services, who assists the Royal Naval Chaplain a-nd receives  200 per annum for his services.It would, however, be for consideration whether the&apos; officiating clergyman i /c troops should not receive some extra remuneration out of this  200 saved, as he only now receives  200 per annum from War Depart-ment funds, and it is neoessary for him to devote practically his whole time to his Military duties, saving, the expense of a Commissioned Chaplain who was formerly allowed for troops at Chatham.

The whole-time Naval Chaplain could undertake charge of the Military personnel. There is no whole-time Military Chaplain, the troops attending local churches, and capitation allowances amounting to approximately  80 per&apos;annum being paid to each of two officiating clergymen at different local churches (one Presbyterian and one United Board). A saving of approximately  160 per annum would therefore result.There are no whole-time Chaplains. The same clergymen of different denominations officiate also for the Royal Navy, and it has been suggested that where the allowances are paid on a ca-pitation basis separately for Naval, Military and Air Force personnel, the numbers of these three Forces should be combined, this involving at times (according as the numbers fluctuate) a slight saving. This question is being examined by the Departments.There are no troops at Eastchurch or Isle of Grain, both Royal Air Force stations. The officiating Roman Catholic Chaplain at Sheerness attends at Eastchurch under local arrangements, and it is not economical to send Royal Air Force personnel from Eastchurch to Sheerness for combined services, nor is it feasible for troops at Sheerness to attend the services of any denomination at Eastchurch.The Commander of the Royal Air Force at Isle of Grain is arranging to utilise the services of the Sheerness officiating clergyman, and the only economy that might be effected is as indicated above, by taking into account for capitation purposes the numbers of Royal Air Force personnel attending services at Sheerness.Numbers of men (other than the Churoh of England) very small. No economical co-ordination possible, owing to the small detachments being widely scattered.Dover Harbour is no longer a naval port, and there are no Royal Air Force personnel within this area.Arrangements have been made for Roman Catholic Naval Ratings serving at Sandgate and Dover Coast-guard Stations to come under the charge of the Roman Catholic Army Chaplains at Shorncliffe Camp and Dover respectively, and for ratings belonging to denominations other than Church of England at Shoeburyness Coast-guard Station to be included in the Military arrange-ments. . Capitation allowances will thus be saved.N.B. The other Air Force stations situated with the Eastern (Army) Command are too remote from Naval or Military stations to permit of co-ordination.Except as stated below, no change of the present arrange-monts conducing to further economy is considered prac-tioa&quot;ble, sinoe, wlierever the distance or other circum-stances allow, co-ordination exists. It is possible that co-ordination with regard to Roman Catholic Chaplains and officiating clergymen may exist at Portsmouth and Gosport, but this question will be further examined by the three Departments.There is no case where personnel of the Navy, Army and Air Force is located at the same stations or where co-ordination is possible.There are no cases of overlapping or unnecessary appoint-monts of Chaplains or officiating clergymen. Co-ordination is being strictly observed.39.163&amp; 2

f (-REPORT.In this Report we have had in view the conditions and circunv. stances of peace time, or, at most, the conditions Imposed by a&apos; small war. The organisation of the whole nation which would be essential in a great war obviously requires separate consideration, and while our peace-time organisations should lend themselves as far as possible to rapid expansion, we have not allowed this factor substantially to affect our views.2. It is also necessary that we should emphasise the difficulties associated with any investigation of the supply problems at the present time, and, in particular, the difficulty of making any reasonable comparisons with pre-war conditions. At the moment all three Services are buying little on account of armament and general stores owing to the existence of war stocks. Certain sections of the Supply Departments, for example, inspection, are specially busy with re-examination and re-conditioning of these war stocks. Moreover, one of the lessons of the war has been the necessity for greater development and concentration on research and experiment. The appreciation of this on the part of all three Services has been most marked and is reflected in a considerable increase in expenditure on research, experiment and design.3. In recent years the questions covered by our terms of reference have1 been explored to a certain extent in connection with a proposal to constitute a Ministry of Supply which would be responsible for the purchase of all Government supplies.. We have informed ourselves of these investigations, which resulted in a Cabinet decision to the effect that a. Ministry; of Supply should not be proceeded with, but,that in order to secure economy the three Services should set up a Joint Committee &quot; to regulate and co-ordinate their purchases and supply.&quot; As a con-sequence of this decision the Committee known as the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee was formed, composed of the directors of contracts in each of the three Departments.* At a later date the Geddes Committee on National Expenditure recommended the creation of a Ministry of Defence, and it is understood that the view is commonly held that the creation of any such Ministry would involve inter, alia an amalgamated  SupplyFurther references to the work of this Committee appear later in the Report.
Department. The Geddes Committee, however, confined them-selves to etating that complete co-ordination in supply would be one of the results of the creation of a Defence Ministry.4. We interpret the Supply Departments of the fighting Services as the organisations responsible for obtaining or pro-ducing the material needs of those Services from the requisitioning stage to the delivery of those needs to the Service Store Depots or distribution authority. Consideration discloses the existence of three main authorities concerned in the whole problem : (a) The user, i.e., the combatant branch of the Servicerepresented by the requisitioning authority ;(b) The technical authority which interprets the requisitionand translates it into a specification conforming to the technical experience of the user;(c) The civilian authority in the form of the ContractsBranch, which deals with the purchase in a com-mercial sense (except in the case of local contracts and the purchase of animals).5. In practically every case the functions of the requisitioning authority overlap those of the technical authority. To assist the technical authority there are Research, Experimental, Design, and Inspection Branches, while associated with the contract authority there are Finance Branches. The existing organisa-tions of each Service consist of sections or branches charged with these various responsibilities, but variations exist in the demarcation of these in the different Services. For example, in the Navy the functions of technical supervision, design, and inspection frequently overlap and in some cases are performed by the same officer, whereas in the Air Force and in the M.G.O.&apos;s Department of the War Office inspection is a clearly defined branch. In addition to these functions, we must add production^ and its supervision in the case of the Royal Factories and Dockyards.Supply for the fighting Services is mainly provided by Supply Departments centrally situated and organised in the respective headquarters of the Navy, Army and Air- Force. There is, however, an important exception in the case of the greater part of the Quartermaster-General&apos;s supplies for the Army, of which food is the main item. These supplies are &quot; provided by local purchase and amount in the present year to a total* Production includes the administration and&apos; organisation of tlio Ordnance Factories and Dockyards.
of roughly four-Fifths of the whole of the Quartermaster-General&apos;s supply expenditure. The Supply Services for the Air Force in those areas where they are or will Be responsible for their own supply, such as Iraq, are on the same footing as also afe to a certain extent fresh food supplies for the Navy at Overseas Stations. This situation&apos; must constantly be borne in mind as it constitutes an almost insuperable difficulty to a complete amalgamation of the Supply Services.G. At this stage we desire to point out that we have not regarded storage and distribution as being embraced in our Reference. From our investigations we are convinced that these functions should be earned out by the Service concerned. A general pool of cornmon stores might appear likely to secure economy and prevent overlapping of stocks, but investigation discloses the impracticability of such a scheme meeting the actual needs of three Services which differ fundamentally, not only in their functions, but also in their organisation and their geographical distribution;7. The character of the needs of the Services does not differ materially in range or complexity. The technical problems involved in the supply of a battle cruiser, a complete aeroplane, or a heavy howitzer ate, in the main, of equally great technical variety. At the other end of the scale in each Service there are required the most ordinary commodities. Considered, therefore, from the standpoint of range of technical complexity, a single Supply Department for the three Services would appear merely to involve the creation of a Department similar to any one of the existing Departments, but of greater magnitude. The problem, however, begins to present its difficulties when it is recalled that the technical authority must translate the needs of the user into a specification for the use of the Contracts Branch. In the case of all highly technical requirements, and even in regard to requirements of a more common nature, the user and the technical authority must be most intimately associated, so closely, in fact, that no definite line can be drawn between them. For example, almost all the Members of the Board of Admiralty are immediately concerned with the technical details of a warship. The Chief of the Air Staff must retain the right to alter or modify the material involved in a contract for aeroplanes, and similarly the. Master-General of Ordnance, while responsible for the design and supply of a fighting tank, must necessarily conform in his every-day work to the policy of the General Staff. There-fore, it is clear that grave difficulties are involved in attempting to draw a hard and fast line of demarcation and responsibility between the fighting arm of a Service and the technical Department associated with supply for that Service.8. It has been suggested that amalgamation of the Contracts and Financial Branches might be brought about, while still
leaving the technical sections in the hands of the Services. Such procedure would lead to the creation of a Department merely identified with a single aspect of supply, and, as will be seen later, an aspect by no means of the first importance. The con-tract officer by himself can rarely complete a purchase trans-action unless he is closely in touch with the technical officer, because matters of design and pattern are involved in a sub-stantial proportion of all purchases. This phenomenon was clearly disclosed by the early experience of the Ministry of Muni-tions. After the Ministry was created, it was soon appreciated that the. fulfilment of its responsibilities was impossible unless it had control of design and technical supervision. In our view, the amalgamation of the Contracts Departments by themselves would create a Department of little value from any point of view ; it would lead to additional correspondence, loss of time, and give rise to much friction. On the other hand, the amalgamation of .the entire Supply Departments would be an infinitely more -practical proposition, but, urrfortunately, one which would iritro-- duce a grave disadvantage it would involve a definite cleavage line being drawn between the user, i.e., the actual combatant , branches of the three Services and the technical authority. It may be said that this difficulty could be met by very close liaison between the new Department and the fighting Services. During the war this course was adopted, for example, the Master-General of Ordnance attended the meetings of the Munitions Council, while the Director-General of Aircraft Production was not only a member of the Munitions Council but also of the Air Council. In a war-time atmosphere, border-line questions of responsibility were dealt with in an arbitrary fashion. The spirit of working for the common good tended to relegate definite Departmental responsibility to the background. Such arrangements would be found unsatisfactory in peace time, when financial responsibility must necessarily be closely defined. Without the stimulus of war, purely departmental needs are apt to assume greater importance than they merit when considered from the widest point of view.9. A single Supply Department under any one authority, having on its Council as members the Third and Fourth Sea Lords, the Quartermaster-General and Master-General of Ord-nance, the Director-General of Aircraft Supply and Research representing the users, together with the heads of the branches of the Supply Departments, would suffer severely on account of the 1 dual responsibility of the Service members. We are of opinion that an amalgamation and co-ordination of supply could only be a practical proposition as a concomitant part of a Ministry which controlled a defence force in which the identity of the Naval, Military and Air Services had been merged. Only in such circumstances could the complete amalgamation of Supply Services be envisaged, and, as far as we are aware, such a revolu-
tionary idea as the merging of the identity of the three Services has never been contemplated. In the meantime, under present conditions, we are convinced that any change which would result in a cleavage of responsibility between the user and the supply authority would involve a loss of efficiency, and would tell against economy in the truest sense. In the case of supply of a highly technical character, efficiency and economy are jeopardised by any division of financial control and responsibility.10. From time to time criticisms of the present system have been made and suggestions put forward in favour of amalgarna-tion of supply under a single authority, and we consider this a suitable opportunity to deal with some&quot; of the more constantly recuiTing remarks in detail.Criticism.(i) The Departments of State are continually competing with one another for supplies and contractors are accordingly able to play off one Department against another and thereby cause an enhancement of price.(ii) Where certain stores are common to several Depart-ments the amount required for stock, if there were a central pool,&quot; would be less than if each Department had its own reserves.Answer.We have been unable to obtain any evidence whatever of competition between the three Services for any class or nature of supply under peace conditions. Furthermore, we are of opinion that if any examples of this should arise the machineiy provided &quot;by the Contracts Co-ordinating Gom-mittee will enable this problem to be satisfactorily dealt with.It is clear that the-existence of war stocks and of the general post-war situation of financial stringency renders any investi-gation of this factor extremely difficult, but we are convinced that a central pool of common stores would be impracticable, both owing to the difference of character of stores required by the three Services and owing to the geographical distribution of . the different units composing the Services, and, further, in view of the small stocks now maintained, which in fact only provide for current consump-tion, there is no substantial overlapping. We again repeat our view that the responsibility and control of stores must rest, with the users.39463
and Air Force wish to have before them a complete statement showing the financial aspect of the existing supply systems of the three Services.   They accordingly request that you will be so good as to provide a statement showing the estimated total f Army      &quot;)expenditure in the i Navy      \ for the current year on Supply. ( Air Force jThis statement of expenditure should be shown under two main headings : -(a) The expenditure on supply purchases (including repairs)from either contractors or Royal establishments and factories, differentiating between : (i) Highly technical supplies, as regards which theDepartments consider no question of over-lapping should arise, and which the Depart-ments consider must be dealt with by themselves;(ii) Intermediate supplies or stores, which, subjectto special arrangements, for example, asregards inspection, might be considered ascommon stores; (iii) Common stores, stock commodities and - stan-dardised articles. In regard to all three sub-headings above, par-&apos;   ticularly in regard to (ii) and (iii), a further sub-division into groups of like classes or categories,- such as food, clothing and textiles, boots, medical stores, hand tools, etc., etc., should be made.(b) The expenditure on the establishments concerned withthe obtaining of the above-mentioned supplies.   This should show under separate headings, as far as practicable, the requisitioning staff,&apos;the experimental design and technical staff, the contracts and purchase staff, the inspection staff and accounting staff, but should exclude storage and distribution. The clerical staff should be included in each case in their own Department.   Again, a further sub-division should show, as far as possible, the expenditure attributable to the detailed sub-headings (A) (i), (ii) and (iii) above. 2. The Sub-Committee appreciate the fact that it may not be possible in every case to make a useful sub-division as indicated above, and, in this case, &apos; certain   groupings  and  qualifying statements may be necessary.   In view of this, the Sub-Committee consider that the value of the statements would be greatly enhanced if representatives of the three Departments could arrange to meet so as to draw up uniform headings and sub-divisions for the separate statements.3. Owing to the existence of a similar Sub-Committee on the Amalgamation of the Transport Departments, the Sub-Committee have decided that certain items which are really items of Supply
Criticism, i (iii) The Contract Officers of. the -&quot;Fighting Departments are not sufficiently acquainted with trade conditions to know how economy could be secured by slight alterations in the patterns of articles which would be matters of common knowledge to any trade expert, particu-larly in the case of articles of every-day use, such as cutlery and domestic utensils.(iv) Contract Officers are also uninformed in regard to the state of the world&apos;s markets, and accordingly are bad purchasing agents from a commercial and business point of view. A Ministry of Supply, it. is argued, could take advan-tage of the ever-changing state of the market in labour and materials.(v) The personnel generally of the Supply Departments are not sufficiently trained or suffi-ciently experienced in tech-nical matters, and for that reason the supply arrange-ments for the Navy and Army have been bad.Answer.We consider it advisable to answer.criticisms (hi), (iv) and (v) together. Without con-testing these assertions, which are not agreed to by the Depart-ments, it is not apparent to us how mere amalgamation of these offices would effect any improvement in the capacity of the officials by whom they are staffed. This argument appears to us only to lead to the single conclusion that the existing Supply Departments should be staffed by individuals possessing more business&apos; ex-perience, greater capacity and wider knowledge of commercial conditions. We do not feel that our reference calls on us to investigate the capabilities of civil servants and technical officers or the suitability of their training, but we should not be prepared to agree, from evidence which has been laid before us, that the Supply staffs generally are unsuited to fulfil then responsibilities. It may be true that their training and experience differs in many ways from that of trade buyers, designers and technicians. At the same time, it must be remembered that in regard to many of the more highly-tech-nical forms of supply the majority of the experience has been obtained within the Ser-vices, in many instances such experience can only be so obtained since private &quot;firms do not design and produce the articles required, and we are of opinion that in the case of certain weapons of war it is a state of affairs which may become more marked in the future.
11. We now proceed to study,the Supply situation in a some-what narrower sense, and particularly with the view of establish-ing the extent of triplication involved.The objective of our researches is the achievement of economy in the Supply branches of the Services, and there is an assumption that this could be accomplished by amalgamation. We would remark that this objective of economy is equally in evidence in all the great industrial enterprises at present, but to secure it much more reliance is placed on detailed investigation and drastic treatment of all sources of expenditure throughout the existing system of. the organisation, rather than on revolutionary changes in that system. Apart from the action indicated in our recom-mendations, we believe the foregoing to be the more fruitful policy of achieving economy in any branch of the Service Departments. -12. A. noticeable tendency of administrative theory , of the present day is to suppose that&quot; a re-organisation of the Depart-ments of Government, by which one Department shall undertake all work of a particular nature for the whole Government Services, will make for economy. The view we have taken on this point is that each case must be considered on its merits and not merely on any a priori theory.13. It is obvious that there are two fields over which economy in supply might be effected : first, economy through a reduction in the price of supplies, and, secondly, economy through reducing the cost of obtaining the supply, i.e., by a reduction in the ad-ministrative and executive staffs-of the Supply Departments. Our reference states that we are to make proposals &quot; in order to reduce the cost of the present-triplication.&quot; This would- appear to assume that the functions performed by the staffs of the Supply branches of the three Services overlap and thereby cause ayoid-able waste, which it may be.jnferred is likely to be in its turn the origin of other causes of waste.14.- Consideration of former papers and memoranda existing on the subject disclose this same outstanding characteristic--an underlying assumption that there is avoidable waste through triplication. It is noticeable that throughout these papers no figures or data are furnished as examples of this, and no concrete examples are given showing where definite economies could be effected by amalgamation. The papers as a whole confine them-selves to broad generalisations. Apart from the fact that our reference specifically instructs us to show the definite saving which would be effected by our recommendations, we became convinced that if we confined ourselves to generalisations, we would only produce the unconvincing and inconclusive results arrived at by our predecessors. Accordingly, we decided to attack the problem from another angle, i.e., that of establishing in the first place the salient characteristics of the present Supply De-partments, the field of their expenditure, and the field associated39468 h 2
with the cost of their administration. If we were able to estab-lish wasteful characteristics in the present system, we might then usefully -proceed to study the remedial steps.15. As a preliminary step we invited the three Services&apos;to furnish us with specific data.Our -questionnaire letter to the Departments asking for details of the cost of their supply services and their replies are attached as Annexures I-IV to this Report. It is obvious that in certain ways these statements are only approximately accurate, and a measure of care must be exercised in drawing inferences from them. All the Services wisely emphasise the difficulty of allocating against particular categories of supply the -correct expenditure on the whole establishment and on its various sections. They point out that technical officers, and in the case of Quartermaster-General&apos;s Services, particularly the officer con-concerned with local purchase, have other duties to perform than merely those connected with supply, and the withdrawal from them of their supply duties would not lead to any economy in personnel. They also draw attention to the fact that for the period under review comparatively little on account of armament and general stores is being purchased owing to the existence of war stocks, and that as the ratio of cost of the establishment is accordingly high, the same staffs could provide such items of supply on a larger scale.16. Our object in asking for this data was to obtain an outline picture of the general field and activity of the Supply Depart-ments. In order to render the statements more easily compre-apprehended, and to preserve a true sense of proportion, we have reproduced the salient features of the statements in the form of graphic diagrams, Annexure&apos;V.* As desired in our letter, the Departments have&apos;divided the expenditure on supply into three categories : I. Highly -technical supplies as regards which the Depart-ments consider no question of overlapping arises, and which the Departments consider must be dealt with by themselves.II. Intermediate stores which, subject to special arrange-ment, for example, as regards inspection, may be considered as common stores. III. Common stores, stock commodities, and standardised articles.17. This sub-division was originally made in 1920 by the three Departments when working collectively on the problem. It may appear obvious from an outsider^ point of view that certain items are included in category I which might reasonably enough&quot;The diagrams do not show the actual figures outlined in the statements furnished by the three Services, but have been amended as shown in the next paragraph.
be placed in either- of the two final categories. For example, the Admiralty include fuel, the Army include a large proportion of clothing, and the Air Ministry include petrol, each of which at first sight would appear to fall into categories II or III. In our diagrams we have,allocated items from category I to category II or III in those cases in which we do not consider that the Departments are justified in considering such items as highly technical, and, generally speaking, we are satisfied that the items included in the diagram in category! are genuinely those of a highly technical nature as regards which, in design, specification and inspection, there can reasonably be held to be no overlapping.Figure A, Annexure 5, shows the total gross expenditure on supply purchases, including repairs from either contractors or royal establishments, dockyards, and factories for all three Ser-vices, and relatively the total expenditure on the establishments concerned with the obtaining of these supplies.Figure B shows the supply expenditure on the Navy divided into the foregoing three categories, and against each category appears the cost of the organisation for, obtaining that- supply. &apos; Figure C gives a similar analysis for the Air Force, and Figure D for the Army. In the latter case, however, it has been found necessary to sub-divide the figures into Quartermaster-General&apos;s Department and Master-General of Ordnance&apos;s Department, and since an overwhelming proportion of the Quartermaster-General&apos;s stores are purchased locally, no sub-division into categories has been found practicable.Figure E shows the total supply expenditure under categories II and III for the three Services. The sum allocated to those by the Master-General of Ordnance is excluded. It albo shows the cost of obtaining these supplies.Figure F shows a comparative statement of the cost of the different sections of the three Supply Departments concerned in obtaining supply. In the case of the Accounting Department, a proper deduction has been made for the accounting staff con-cerned in the recording and payment of wages in the Boyal Dockyards, as this is obviously not a true item of headquarter&apos;s establishment cost.18. We wish to draw particular attention to the figures con-tained in Figure F. This diagram clearly shows the overwhelm-ing proportion of the cost of the Design, Technical and Expert mental, and Inspection Departments to the total cost of supply, and we have accordingly examined these Departments in detail to ascertain if any triplication exists and to what extent co-ordination has been arranged for.We find the total expenditure of the Master-General of Ordnance&apos;s branch on Design, Technical and Experimental De-partments to be  800,000&apos; (of this  180,000 is contributed by other Government Departments); this expenditure is divided up as follows : The Ordnance Committee, the Research Department, the Design Department, the Experimental Establishment at&apos;
Shoeburyness, the Chemical Warfare Committee, and the Chemical Warfare Station, costing in all . 645,000; all of these are joint establishments, with representation from all three Services, and consequently they are already co-ordinated.Thus only  155,000 remains for establishments under single War Office control; this amount is divided up between the following establishments : (a) The Small Arms Committee and the Small ArmsMachine-gun Establishment at Hythe, and, as pointed out in paragraph 24 of this Report, the Navy and Air Force obtain their requirements in these respects from the War Office ;(b) The Signal Experimental Establishment which belongssolely to the War Office,, and, though the Admiralty and Air Ministry keep up somewhat similar estab-lishments, owing to the entirely different needs of these Services as regards signalling, we have satisfied ourselves that everything possible is done to exchange ideas and avoid overlapping;(c) The Searchlight Establishment of the Master-Generalof Ordnance, which is purely for War Office require-ments and is chiefly employed on anti-aircraft work ; the Admiralty Searchlight Establishment is, we find, employed on entirely different work;(d) The Tank Design and Experimental Establishment,the Royal Engineer Board and the Royal Artillery Committee, which by their nature are purely military organisations, though the results of then experiments are circulated to the Admiralty and Air-Ministry who apply to these establishments for such informa-tion or equipment connected with these establishments as they require. We thus find that of the total expenditure for design, technical and experimental work under the Master-General of Ordnance three-fourths is already co-ordinated and administered under a joint control provided by all three Services, and of the remainder one-half is expended upon an amalgamated supply while the other half is devoted to supply of a purely military nature, which ih the ordinary case does not concern either the Navy or Air Force, so that no triplication can occur.We have similarly satisfied ourselves that triplication does not occur in the corresponding Departments of the Admiralty and Air Ministry.19. The situation with regard to inspection is much the same. Taking the Admiralty figure we find that the total cost of inspec-tion is  471,000. Of this amount  448,000 is spent on the inspection of highly&apos; technical items in which there is no over-lapping with the War Office or the Air Ministry. The remainder is only  23,000, and of this  19,000 is spent on the inspection of -items in Group II and only  4,000 on items in Group III.   The
figures for inspection as regards the War Office and the Air Ministry,are of a similar character. Hence in the case of all three Services the costs of the inspection of items in Group II and III are so small that even if triplication did exist there would not be sufficient grounds to warrant the complete amalga-mation of the Inspection Departments for these items, while inspection of articles in Group I, owing to their highly technical nature, is such that no overlapping can occur. In fact, it seems to us to be not only inadvisable but also impracticable to amalga-mate the Inspection Departments. We wish, however, in this connection to draw attention to the  Technical Co-ordinating Committees which we recommend in para. 26 of this Report. We. consider-that these committees should study the problem of uniform inspection methods, and we are of opinion that by this means and by the adoption of standardised articles where possible some economies may be effected. We are also of opinion that advantage should be taken of such opportunities as may occur for one Service to accept the inspection of another Service.20. Wo make no pretence that our investigations have been thoroughly exhaustive, or that we have closely examined detailed examples of purchases or of designs. Such a procedure&apos; would not have been possible in the time allowed us for the preparation of this Report. We can only say that, if earlier investigators dealt with the broadest generalisations, we have carried the investigation a stage further.We also draw attention to the fact that we have not considered in detail the actual supply expenditure of any one Department in which there is no question of overlapping; such questions we consider to be ones either of policy or for investigation by the Department concerned and the Treasury.21. From a study of the diagrams contained in Annexure V and which we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs we would draw attention to the following points :-(i) At a time when little is being purchased, on accountof the existence of war stocks, the total expenditure of the three Services on establishment of every nature associated with obtaining-supply, including research, design, technical supervision, and experiment of all kinds, represents less than 9 per cent, of the total expenditure on supply.(ii) Eighty-one per cent, of the total expenditure on supply is represented by highly technical commodities in Category I and of a non-overlapping nature.(iii) Eighty-nine per cent, of the total establishment expen-diture is associated with the supply comprised in Category I.(iv) The establishment cost of obtaining supply in. CategoriesII and III is less than 3 per cent, of the cost of that supply.(v) Taking supply as a whole for all three Services, the total cost of accounting, requisitioning, and purchas-ing is only 8 per cent, of the total establishment cost.
(vi) Of the entire cost of establishment expenditure, the sections comprising research, design, experiment, technical supervision and inspection absorb 91 per cent.22. We also wish to draw attention to the fact that arguments have been advanced for the creation of a more commercial and businesslike attitude in regard to supply. Those appear to us to have their primary importance in connection with the design and pattern of the more common stores or ordinary commodities. It has not been found possible in the time at our disposal to investigate closely the details of pattern and design, but all the Contract Directors have agreed that some measure of economy could be achieved by revision of patterns and design, by efforts being made either to use a common design for the three Services, or to adopt for the Services the designs and patterns used in civil life. So far as we have been able to ascertain, the most fruitful field for economy lies in co-ordination and standardisation of design of stores and cdmmon commodities. This was evidently realised by the three Services when they proposed to the Cabinet that a Co-ordinating Committee on Supply should be constituted, for the terms of reference of this Committee read as follows:  &quot; To initiate suggestions for modified Service patterns in order to secure the greatest possible standardisation &apos;of articles in common use.&quot;We consider it a matter for regret that this line of activity was handed over in its entirety to a committee composed of contract officers only. In our view, the authority directly responsible for design and pattern should have been made responsible for the co-ordination and standardisation of design and pattern.23. We consider it only fair to state our impression that the need not only for economy, and the reduction of overlapping, but also for general improvement in supply procedure, is appre-ciated by the Supply Departments. While they are frankly i opposed to amalgamation, in view of the difficulties and die-advantages which they foresee in such a course, much is to be expected from the fact that they declare their desire to take advantage of each other experience for the general good. While opposing amalgamation, they desire freedom to use the facilities of any other Service in regard to any special commodity which for various reasons that Service can supply better or cheaper than they can. They strongly support the activity within their own sphere of the Contracts Co-ordinating Com-mittee, and agree that co-ordination should be carried further into the technical region. Practical evidence of this general feeling is indicated by the various decisions now being acted upon, e.g., (i) joint contracts for articles in common use by the three Services, and agency contracts made by one Department to cover also the requirements of one or both the others,
(ii) indents by Departments on tbe stocks of the Department which is the largest user,21. Apart from either amalgamation or co-ordination, we have also examined a system of supply which was considerably developed during the war with a large measure of success, in certain cases we refer to the agency system, whereby one Department indents on another for the supply of a particular store or commodity. Perhaps the best example of the successful operation of this system at present is the supply of small arms, machine-guns and small-arm ammunition, for whicli the Army is the sole supply authority.We consider that such a practice should be further developed wherever, owing to any combination of circumstances, one Department is in a better position than another to arrange the supply of particular items, but we are informed that there are at present constitutional difficulties with regard to the finance side of this question, since a Department is not permitted to sell to another Department stores unless that Department has made provision for the supply of these stores in the Estimates accepted by Parliament. If such a sale does take place, the selling Department cannot utilise the money so obtained either for the replacement of the article sold or for any other purpose without the express sanction of Parliament obtained on a Supple-mentary Estimate. This naturally means that on many occasions full use cannot be made of the agency system. We have accord-ingly asked the Treasury representative on the Sub-Committee (Sir G. L. Barstow, Controller of Supply Services) to enquire further into this question so that the mo.tter may be further considered by the Main Committee.In connection with the agency system, we asked the Office of Works for a memorandum on the subject of the supply of furniture-ture and of the ability of that Department to supply furniture to all the Departments of Government, including the fighting Services. After a study of the memorandum by the Office of Works it appears to us that the agency system might be employed advantageously in the case of the supply of furniture, but as, like all supply problems, it requires close and detailed examina-tion, we confine ourselves to recommending that this question be referred to the appropriate Technical Co-ordinating Committee, (see paragraph 26) for detailed consideration. (Our letter to the Office of Works and their reply are attached to this Report as Annexure YI.)25. As a result of our enquiries as contained in the preceding paragraphs, we can briefly express our conclusions as follows :  (1) The complete amalgamation of the Supply Department of the three Services into a central, amalgamated Supply Service, would diminish the efficiency of supply of the individual fighting Services, and such action sum t
would only become warranted if associated with the &apos; complete amalgamation of all the fighting Services into a force in which their individual characteristics had been merged.(2) A general pool of common stores to meet the needs of all three Services is impracticable.   (Para. 6.)(3) The cost of the requisitioning, accounting and contracting branches of the Supply Departments of the three Ser-yices is so small actually and relatively, that even if triplication does exist, the amalgamation of these branches on the ground of economy in establishments alone is not warranted; still less would amalgamation of these branches be justified in regard to the stores and supplies involved in categories II and III. (Para. 21.)(4) The amalgamation of the technical branches and inspec-tion branches is unjustifiable and impracticable. (Paras. 18 and 19.)(5) The constitution of a Central Contracts Department for the purchase of selected stores and commodities would not result in any substantial economy in establish-tnerits and we do not consider it is warranted on other grounds in view of its many disadvantages.  (Para. 8.)(6) The greatest freedom and encouragement should be given by the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry to&apos; their Supply Departments and to the Contract, Technical and other Co-ordinating Committees for the interchange of data and information in regard to all supply questions; in particular to the investigation of the extent to which the agency system of supply , might be adopted.   (Paras. 22-24.)(7) The Contracts Co-ordinating Committee, being merely representative of the contract aspect of supply, is strictly limited in its usefulness. Co-ordination of technical design and pattern is at least of equal import-ance and should receive close and detailed treatment - to ensure its fullest realisation in practice.  (Para. 23.)RECOMMENDATIONS.26. In view of the conclusions which we have already reached we recommend(1) That no steps should be taken to bring about either com- -plete or partial amalgamation of the supply branches of the three fighting Services or of any sections of those branches.(2) Since it is essential in the interests of economy that there should be complete co-ordination wherever possible of design,, pattern and specification of stores and commodities other than those of a highly technical
nature required by the three Services, that five Technical Co-ordinating Sub-Committees should be appointed to meet at definite intervals to deal with : (a) Foodstuffs.(b) Clothing and textiles.(c) Mechanical transport(d) General stores.(e) Medical and veterinary stores.Whatever sub-division of stores may be agreed upon for the purpose of these Committees, it is clear that detailed investigation with regard to particular items of supply would- need investigation by special Sub-Committees.(3) That the terms of reference for these Technical Co-ordinating Committees should be as follows :-(a) To consider the adoption, wherever possible, oftrade patterns for commodities and stores common to and in use by the three Services.(b) The standardisation, wherever practicable, of the specification and design of commodities and-stores common to and in use by the three Services  for  which  a trade pattern  is ; unsuitable.(c) The co-ordination of the methods and procedure of inspection as far as possible. That these Technical Co-ordinating Committees should be composed of one or more representatives for each Committee from eaoh Service, these being technical officers with authoritative rank and with a knowledge of Service practice and experience. In cases where other Government Departments are large purchasers of similar stores, representatives from those Departments might also be added as associate members.We have considered a proposal that a business man - of repute and standing, chosen from a panel selected by the Federation of British Industries or other repre-sentative organisation or from the associate members of the existing War Office Technical Committees, should be associated with the new Committees as a member. While we agree as to the value of business opinion in the consideration of the matters in question, there is some difference of opinion as to whether the man with trade experience should be brought in at an early stage and as an integral part of the Committees or whether he should be introduced when his ex-perience is felt to be required by the Committees. We feel there is much to be said in favour of each of these views, but we do not think that meantime a decision one way or the other would detrimentally affect the work of the Committees, and we therefore suggest that 39163 I g
it should be left to experience to decide whether trade experience could be usefully applied and, if so, at what stage.(4) That the attention of the Contracts Co-ordinating Com-mittee be drawn to the Technical Co-ordinating Com-mittees recommended above,&apos; and that they should refer to these Committees all suggestions for co-ordina-tion of design and pattern.(5) That the agency system, whereby one Department may -&quot;indent, on another for the supply of stores or cornmodi-ties, which owing to any combination of circumstances that Government Department is in a better position than the other to supply, should be encouraged and de-developed, e.g., the particular case of furniture supplied by the Office of Works should receive immediate in-investigation by the appropriate Technical Co-ordinating Committee.(6) That the Treasury should investigate the financial diffi-culties which at present prevent a full use being made by Departments of the agency system.(Signed)      WeiR.G.

2. In reply My Lords desire fne to forward the enclosed statements, and in doing so to point out that while figures have been given, as desired by Lord Weir&apos;s Committee, for the current year, such figures cannot be regarded as standard. At the present time there are still considerable stocks left over from the war period which are being used up; and as regards new con-struction also, the position is abnormal; for instance, the provi-sion for starting the new battleships this year is only about one-seventh of the amount that would be necessary when their construction is fully under way.3. I am further to state that the various functions described under separate headings and sub-headings in the reference are closely interwoven in Naval administration, and there are a great number of individuals who devote a varying proportion of their time to several of the functions described, and other portions of then time to duties altogether outside those to which the refer-ence relates. In the Supply Departments, the. staff employed in connection with obtaining supplies are also concerned in storage and distribution, the position of stocks and reserves, and administrative and financial questions in general.The Technical Departments of the Admiralty not only design ships and fittings and stores, and inspect and report on repairs) but deal with the multitudinous technical questions arising in connection with the running of the ships on service. There is a mass of reports relating to material received daily from the Fleet and Dockyards relating to condition and performance, experiments, suggestions for improvements, enquiries as to use-and so forth. All these pass through and are discussed by the Technical and Naval, Financial and Civil Administrative Depart-ments concerned. The issue of instructions as to use and the answering of enquiries relating thereto, entail intimate know-ledge of design. Conversely the preparation of design entails intimate knowledge of performance of ships and fittings in all their detail in all waters. As each function is necessary to the fulfilment of the other, and both must be performed by any organisation doing either, it is obviously not only much more economical but much more satisfactory as regards efficiency and promptitude to combine them as they are at the Admiralty. But the combination presents obvious difficulties in giving separate figures as asked for in the reference, and the figures can only be regarded as reflecting the Admiralty opinion as to the best allocation possible as distinct from fact capable of statistical proof.4. The figures given as to staff relate to the Technical, Store, Accounting and Contract Departments concerned. In addition a portion of the time of the Board, &quot;the Naval staff and the financial and secretarial staff is necessarily spent on questions relating to material, and administrative questions relating thereto, but My Lords have not thought it necessary to include any figures relating to them in this statement, as they think that such figures are not required by and would be of no value to Lord Weir&apos;s
Sub-Committee. Similarly the statement does not include any figures on account of the services rendered by the officers serving in the Fleet and Outport Experimental Establishments who make many requisitions and carry out many experiments, nor of those engaged in scientific research whose work ultimately affects supply, but whose activities are already co-ordinated with those of other Departments under arrangements approved by the Cabinet.5. My Lords desire me to add that while they have endeavoured to show an allocation of cost of obtaining supplies in the form laid down in the Sub-Committee&apos;s reference, it cer-tainly would not follow that by detaching one of the functions described from the existing organisation, the cost set against it would be available for transfer to another organisation perform-ing the function. As regards the staff of Supply and Technical Departments, for the reasons given in paragraph 3, division of functions would, in most cases, result in duplication of staffs. As regards accounting staff; My Lords assume that,&apos; even if arrangements were made for setting up some Central Authority for the supply of certain classes of commodities for the three Departments, each Department would still have to provide on its Votes for the cost of supplies so obtained, and machinery would consequently have to be provided in each Department for dealing with the cash accounting arrangements involved. It is doubtful whether, in fact, the work of the existing Departments would be appreciably less than under existing arrangements. More-over, store accounting arrangements would have to continue very much on present lines.6. As the letter under reply is limited to a request for certain particulars as to cost of supplies and staff, My Lords have con-fined their remarks to these questions and have not dealt with the questions of policy involved.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,0.

The  quantities having been determined, the mechanical requisi-tioning upon the Purchasing Department is quite a small matter, and the cost of the Staff for this purpose alone cannot be taken as more than about  400 spread over the year, but this work would have to be done in any case by the Storing, &amp;c. Department. Tbe determination of the precise description and standard of quality of the articles to be pur-chased rests with the Storing, &amp;c. Department, whether the stores are purchased to a definite Specification or to accepted samples.   The work of drawing up Specifications, &amp;c. is performed by the Technical Examining Officers, who later are responsible for the inspection examination and testing of contract deliveries.   These officers and their examining staff are also responsible for the inspection, &amp;c. of food, clothing, &amp;c. returned into store from H.M. Ships and Fleet Establishments at Home and Abroad. In connection with the figures given under &quot; Ex-perimental Design, &amp;c.&quot; and &quot;InspectingStaff,&quot; it must be understood that the amount under Group II would still remain as a cost to Navy Votes as the work of designing, inspecting, &amp;c. would still be carried out by the Admiralty, and that only a part of the amount given under Group 3 would be a saving to Navy Votes.			2,154,000		946,000

Inspection of stores is carried out by the Technical Officers of the Admiralty and War Uffice. In the latter case an interdepartmental charge of 6 per cent, is raised. For the few stores delivered direct to R.M. Divisions, the inspection is one of the duties performed by R.M. Officers and Master Tailors at R.M. Divisions, and the sir-vices of these Officers and Master Tailors would still be - required if inspection of certain stores at R.M. Divisions were abolished.			177,500		41,500						II.

A sum of  286,800 for Colonial Allowances which are met out of Vote 7 (Supplies) has not been included in the foregoing estimate, and a sum of  739,000 has been deleted, as this is the amount estimated as expenditure on Eation Allowance.- Total,  1,025,800.2. Of the  7,151,250 a sum of  1,055,500 will, it is estimated, be expended on Headquarter contracts (but the bulk of this expenditure will only come operative on the 1st July, 1922, as previous to this the arrangement for obtaining meat&apos; was made with the Board of Trade). the Headquarter contract expendi-ture is made up as follows :  Frozen Meat ...      ...      ...      .;.      ...      563,00087,000Tea Jam Flour Sugar PetrolTotal46,000 .   70,500 60,000 229,000 1,055,5003. At all stations at Home a cash allowance of 3Jd. per man per day is made for purchase of such articles as fresh vegetables, milk, fish, etc., and this money comes out of Vote 7 (Supplies). In addition, at Home, certain articles of the fixed ration are commutable under certain conditions, viz. : Cheese,Jam,Margarine,Bacon, - &apos;. and for this a sum- of 3&apos;53drper man per day (representing the value of the four commodities mentioned) is found out of Vote 7 (Supplies). It has been found administratively convenient for this commutation to be arranged through the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes, which organisation has by regulation to provide the articles bought with the 3Jd, cash allowance. The total of these two amounts is approximately  1,000,000.Abroad the system is as follows: 4. A definite ration scale is fixed for each station. No cash allowance is provided, but the money necessary to obtain fresh local commodities is found by a system of commutation of certain articles.

Building stores have been classified on the . following principles  Technical. Such articles as ablution ranges, rifle range appliances.Intermediate, Common. Sitz baths, gymnastic apparatus, sanitary appliances.Common. Cement, corrugated iron, felt roofing, glass, grates, ironmongery, pipes, &amp;c.Building stores are mainly purchased locally off running con-tracts, and the figures given are estimates of the stores likely to be purchased for work done by labour directly supervised by the engineers. Most building work is done by contract, which covers the cost of materials, &amp;c.(B) Expenditure on Establishments.It is extremely difficult to frame any estimate of the staffs engaged on the supply, &amp;c., of these stores, since in many cases such supply forms only a part and in others only a small part of then work. Moreover, it is probable that were a central Ministry or other supply organisation set up a large proportion of existing-staffs would still be required in the War Office for requisitioning supplies, &amp;c.So far as purchasing is concerned, the cost of the contracts staff is estimated as follows :  Engaged on munitions stores, &amp;c. Groups (a) and (b) above      .........       4,660Engineer and building stores.(c) and (d) above      .........       6,570As regards requisitioning, the cost of the Woolwich branch engaged on this for the above stores (a), (b), (c), and (d) is put at  14,000.Of the Headquarters Staff the Director of Artillery is concerned with the supply and design of munitions and similar stores (categories (a) .and (b) above). The total cost of the artillery directorate is, say,  37,000.. Taking 20 per cent, of this directorate as engaged on work not connected with the supply and design of stores,  30,000 may be attributed to such supply and design, in the proportion of half and half i.e.,  15,000 for supply and  15,000 for design.The Director of Fortifications and Works is concerned with &apos; the engineer and building stores under (c) and (d) above.   But only a very small portion of his staff is so concerned, say, 20 per cent, of the branch known as F.W.9-costing, say,  3,500 a year.39463 M 3
In payment of bills for above stores, it is estimated that whole-time staff costing not more than  1,500 is involved for head-quarters purchases.As regards Inspection Staff, the full cost (including such items as, e.g.t cost of stores many of which are available in stock, rental values, depreciation of machinery, &amp;c.) of the various establishments engaged on inspection of new and repaired stores is estimated as follows: ,  Chief Inspector of Armament, who deals with the inspection of guns, gun ammunition, small arm ammunition, tanks, vehicles    ......      167,000Of this total  134,000 represents the cost of staff.Chief Inspector of Small Arms, who deals with the inspection of small arms, machine guns, and bicycles      ...     ...     .........      39,000Of this total  28,000 represents the cost of staff.Tank Testing Section, which trys out tanks after preliminary inspection............      11,200Of this total  6,000 represents cost of staff.Proof Section of Research Department.

The following provision has been made in Army Estimates, 1922/23, for Research, Experi-mental and Design Work connected with Munitions and other stores (apart from Headquarter Staff).

But it must not be thought that the expenditure on these Establishments is essential to the provision of the stores for which money is included in 1922/23 Estimates. On the contrary the policy of the Army Council is to push forward Research Experiment and Design and to avoid bulk manufacture until
necessity arises. It may therefore fairly be said that little, if any, of the.expenditure on these Establishments is directly attri-attributable to the current supply of Munitions and Engineer stores..   Summarizing the above figures relating to staff the cost of Requisitioning, Purchasing and Administrative Staff (per-sonnel only) is estimated at  43,480.Inspection (including stores rental values etc.) is estimated at  300,500, of which cost of personnel is  224,000.Experiment and Design (including stores rental values etc.) is estimated at  808,750, of which cost of personnel is  389,750.ANNEXURE IV.COST OP THE SUPPLY DEPARTMENTS OF THE NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE.Letter from thb Air Ministry to thh Secretary to the Sub-Committee.June 14th, 1922.350947/22/S.5. Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to forward herewith copies of two statements (A and B), together with a covering memorandum, giving the information required by Colonel Walker&apos;s letter dated-25th May last (5/Z/40), to he laid before Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee on the Amalgamation of the Supply Departments of the Fighting Services.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)     H. McAnally.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. June 14th, 1922.
LORD WELTS SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE AMALGAMA-TION OE THE SUPPLY DEPARTMENTS OP THE FIGHTING SERVICES.Return showing information required for the Air Ministry.The attached Statement A shows the provision included in the Air Estimates, 1922-23, for expenditure on supply purchases under the three categories specified in paragraph A in Colonel Walker&apos;s letter of 25th May, 1922 (5/Z/40).The following points should be noted in connection with the return :--(1) The provision for aircraft and engines is not normal owing to the fact that stocks of machines and engines acquired during the war are being utilised. Normal requirements will be much greater.(2) The provision for clothing supplies is not normal owing to utilisation of war stocks.(3) The item &quot; provisions &quot; covers rations drawn from the Army : but the Royal Air Force will undertake its own supplies in Palestine and Iraq in 1922-23, and the Air Ministry has suggested that the same course should be adopted&apos;at home.(4) Some experimental work on aircraft engines and instru-ments is undertaken at the Air Ministry experimental establishments, e.g., Farnborough, Martlesham and Grain, whilst a certain amount of production work is also carried out-at Farnborough. The expenditure on these Services, including labour, &amp;o, is included in the figures furnished.(5) The totals include certain provision for local purchases (except in the case of overseas works services), but no corresponding figure has been included in the staff return B, as it cannot readily be ascertained and is quite inconsiderable.The Statement B gives the information asked for as regards the staffs concerned with the obtaining of the supplies mentioned, as required in paragraph B of Colonel Walker&apos;s letter. No particulars have been given of the Air Ministry staffs engaged on experimental, design and technical work, as their employment is not contingent on the purchase of the supplies in question, and has no relation to the provision made in the current Estimates for such expenditure.Air Ministry,June, 1922.

ANNEXURE VI. ORGANISATION OE THE OFFICE OF WORKS FOR. THE SUPPLY OF FURNITURE TO DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT&apos;.1. Letter from the Secretary to the Sub-Committee to the Secretary, Office of Works.5/Z/40.Sir, June 22nd, 1922.I am directed to inform you that Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s Com-mittee on the Amalgamation of the Common Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force has appointed various Sub-Committees to deal with the common Services individually. Lord Weir has been appointed Chairman of the Sub-Committees dealing with supply and transport.At a meeting of Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee on Supply held this morning, various methods of supply by a central Department, by individual Departments, by agency services and otherwise were enquired into, and it was suggested that the supply of furniture might be taken as a typical case in which a Department other than the Fighting Departments might act as the supplying agent to those Departments.It is understood that the opinion is held that the organisation of the Office of Works is such that it.could undertake the supply of furniture, to the various units of the Fighting Services, both in the United Kingdom and abroad, possibly at a less cost and in a more satisfactory manner than it is done at present by the Services themselves; I am accordingly to request that you will be- so good as to furnish a memorandum for the information of Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee showing the way in which the Office of Works is organised for such supply and any &apos; special reasons favourable to this course so that the Sub-Committee may compare this with the existing system whereby the Services supply their own furniture.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, - (Signed)     C. W. G. Walker,Secretary to the Sub-Committee.8SH63
Memorandum on the Organisation, etc., of the Office of Works for the Supply of Furniture to Departments.The supply, maintenance and repair of furniture and house-hold articles to all Civil Departments throughout the country, and to Diplomatic and Consular Residences abroad, is under-taken by the Supplies Division of the Office of Works, which is under the direction of a Controller of Supplies, and under the administrative and financial control of a Permanent Secretary and Secretariat.The Supplies Division, so far as the purchase of furniture is concerned, consists of two distinct sections (A) Technical and (B) Executive.(A) Technical. On the technical side there is a staff of fully-qualified technical officers whose duty it is to design and to prepare drawings with complete specifications for all furniture to be purchased. Further, there are attached to this section technical officers who examine at&quot; the contractors&apos; factories or at the central stores the manufactured goods to ensure that they have been made in accordance with the drawings and specifica-tions.   The technical staff consists of officers who, besides having(2) Letter from the Secretary, Office of Works, to the Secretary of the Sub-Committee.&quot;20769/1922. (3.D.)Sir, 10th: July, 1922.With reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo (5/Z/40) relative to the Committee on the Amalgamation of the Common Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force, I am directed by the First Commissioner of His Majesty&apos;s Works, etc., to enclose, as requested for the information of Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee, a memorandum showing the system at present in force in this Department for the supply of furniture to Civil Departments, and &quot;the reasons favourable to the centralisation of the supply of all furniture required for Government purposes, including the supply of furniture to the various units of the fighting Services, in the hands of this Department.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,    *(Signed)     Lionel Earle.
had a full course of practical training, together with experience in the commercial world, have passed a technical examination conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners. In the course of their work furniture of all descriptions is dealt with, their activities being by no means confined to office furniture, such as tables, cupboards and chairs. The supply of furniture required at Embassies and Consular buildings abroad, which, have frequently to be inspected on the spot, museums, official residences and Eoyal palaces, hospital furniture required by the various Ministry of Pensions&apos; institutions throughout&apos; the country, domestic furniture of various types required for the officers&apos; quarters at Air Force depots, and generally all classes of furniture purchased by the Department in pursuance of its normal functions, is undertaken by them.(B) Executive-Ike actual executive work incidental to the purchase of furniture and other equipment, is carried out by the non-technical or executive side. The functions of this section include investigation into all applications from firms desirous of tendering, and keeping in touch with the trade and trade organisations generally to ensure that firms who have special facilities for any particular kind of work are not omitted from the list of firms to be invited to tender. The policy of the Office of Works, namely, to obtain the fullest possible competition for every contract, is earned out by the Executive Section with precision, and the closest possible co-ordination: with the Con-tracts Section&apos; of the Secretariat is always maintained. Open competition by advertisement is obtained for straightforward contracts over  500 in value, and limited competition between selected firms where the class of work is of such a character as to render such a course desirable, or where the value of the contract is under  500.In regard to the special reasons in favour of the centralisation of the supply of all&apos; furniture required for Government purposes in the hands of the Office of Works, it must be admitted, in the first instance, that such centralisation should follow as a natural corollary to the normal functions of that Department in pro-viding the furniture required by all Crown civil buildings in the country. The mere fact that buildings in the charge of Depart-ments, such as the War Office and the Admiralty, are not civil buildings, should not have weight in deciding whether the fur-niture to go into such buildings sEould, or should not, be provided from a central source. There are indications that a similar arbitrary line which at present exists between furniture required by Class I Post Offices, the responsibility for the provision of which rests with the Office of Works, and- the furniture required by Class II Post Offices, which is provided, by the Post Office, will be broken down, as the Post Office authorities themselves realise that the Office of Works should be the Department responsible for the supply of all furniture, and have, in fact,
asked the Office of Works to function for them in respect of Class II Engineering Offices. This view is strengthened by the experience of the Office of Works in acting as agent for the supply of furniture to the War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry at various periods during and since the war.War Office. In January, 1916, the Director of Army Contracts stated in an official letter that &quot; it had already been arranged semi-officially that the Office of Works shall supply such items of furniture as may be mutually agreed,&quot; and in pursuance of the arrangement then made, large supplies of furniture of all descriptions; which before that date had been purchased by the War Office, were made by the Office of Works. Prior to the supply being made the specifications and patterns were carefully revised by the technical staff of the Office of Works and very substantial savings accrued to the public purse by (o) standardising certain items to- harmonise with standard items already adopted by the Office of Weeks and utilising trade patterns wherever possible, (b) modifying construction in order to take the fullest advantage of the most efficient and up-to-date methods of manufacture, and (c) widening the scope of competition.This agency work on behalf of the War Office continued until the latter part of 1919, and during this period there is no doubt that supply was made economically and expeditiously. The War Office then, however, reverted to the arrangement under which, prior to 1916, they had purchased their own supplies. This revision took place in spite of the recommendation of the War Office Sub-Committee of the Colwyn Committee, which, on 27th, September, 1918, recorded that Mr. Fawcett, Director of Army Contracts, accepted on behalf of his Department the principle that the Office of Works should be responsible for all purchases of furniture. At that meeting the question of the purchase of items not strictly furniture, but akin to furniture, such as ladders, trucks, and wooden tools generally, also came under review, and Mr. Fawcett included these items in his acceptance of the principle of central purchase bv the Office of Works.In addition to the work referred to above, which was.carried out during the years 1916-1919 for the War Office, that Depart-ment as recently as January, 1920, after consultation with the Treasury, requested the Office of Works to furnish throughout the residences of General Officers Commanding in various parts of the country, and this work was duly carried out in a. satis-factory manner.If, as is presumed to be the case, the phrase &quot; furniture &quot; is also held to cover supplies&apos; of floor coverings (linoleum, carpets and rugs), the following extract from a letter addressed to the Office of Works by the.War Office on the 5th November, 1917, is pertinent : &quot; This case again raises the general question of the pro-cedure to be followed in regard to Government purchase
afJof carpets and rugs. The view of this Department has been . that the organisation of carpet supplies should be in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, as being the purchasers of the bulk of Government requirements of this natures and that the War Office should obtain its require-ments through the Office of Works organisation, in order-that full advantage may be taken of stocks and of any orders placed in readiness for meeting the estimated requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Services as a whole.&quot;Admiralty. So far as the purchase of furniture on behalf of the Admiralty is concerned, the experience of the Office of Works, as agent, is limited practically entirely to the supply of standard articles such as tables, chairs and card index cabinets. In these instances the Admiralty accepted without question the. standard types provided by the Office of Works. In regard to the. supply of chairs, it was found that the Admiralty were purchasing a- type of Windsor chair which had to be made specially to their specification, and, after consultation, that Department agreed to accept a simpler trade type already used by the Office of Works for official purposes, which could be manufactured by any Windsor chair manufacturer at a lower cost.Air Ministry. The Office of Works has acted very extensively as agent in the supply of furniture required for the quarters occupied by Air Force officers, and the Air Council have expressed their appreciation of the services of that Department in. this connection.Economy in Staff Expenditure.Centralisation of purchase would, without doubt, ultimately lead to considerable economy of staffs. Under the system of supply of furniture at present in force in the War Office and Admiralty, delivery into either Military or Naval Depots is subject to examination as regards quality by skilled craftsmen, presumably paid a special rate of wage for this work, but with a, centralised system of supply in the hands of the Office o! Works this work would be carried out by travelling Inspectors, who examine and &quot; brand &quot; accepted articles at the factory, and thus save the waste of time and efficiency incidental to a system which condemns goods after delivery. Examination on delivery would thus be limited to that required to detect damage sustained in transit. A very small addition to the inspecting staff of the Office of Works would, it is considered, suffice to meet any extra work incidental . to the supply of furniture now purchased by the War Office and. Admiralty. Similarly, it is thought that the existing personnel of the technical staff dealing with design and draughtsmanship could be quite easily expanded to deal with the additional work which would be thrown upon
it should this policy of centralisation be adopted. The opinion ig also held that, in very many cases, standard types of furniture which had been adopted by the Office of Works after very careful consideration of the best means of obtaining a satisfactory article at the lowest price, will be found to be suitable substitutes for similar articles now being purchased by the other Depart-ments. In fact, experience of the War Office requirements during the period 1916-1919 has confirmed the opinion that such standardisation is practicable in very many instances.Proposed method of Delivery under a Centralised System.As far as the actual delivery of articles to the order of the fighting Departments is concerned an opportunity would be taken of fully exploring the possibility of effecting delivery direct from manufacturer to user in preference to perpetuating what is believed to be the existing system under which bulk supplies of furniture are made to Naval and Military Depots for subsequent distribution to the units requiring the furniture. During the war this system of direct delivery, which has been operative for many years, was applied to the large supplies of Fire Extinguishers, and, wherever possible, to furniture, which was purchased on behalf of the War Office by the Office of Works, and as a result the expense incidental to double handling was saved and, in many instances, freightage charges were also reduced.Summary.In conclusion, it is considered that the Office of Works with its experience in purchasing furniture of all descriptions, and having available a staff of highly trained experts in close touch with all the latest methods of economical construction, should be the Department to which should bo entrusted the work of buying of furniture required for Government establishments. It has functioned successfully during and after the war for the War Office and the Admiralty, is functioning at the moment for the Air Ministry, and could, it is confidently anticipated, undertake the whole of the work connected with the purchase of all Government furniture with a small expansion of existing personnel, thus setting free certain staffs engaged on similar work elsewhere. If central purchase on these lines is adopted, the present differences in the standards of furniture for Officers of the State will be removed; design, purchase, and inspection would be concentrated in one Department, and the fullest possible advantages taken of trade developments. Further, the system of direct delivery to user, which already exists in the Office of Works, could be extended wherever possible, and this should result in setting&apos; free a certain! amount of space now used by other Departments as Central Stores Depots.

SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE AMALGAMATION&apos; OE THE WORKS AND BUILDINGS DEPARTMENTS.Teems op Reference and Composition of Committee.At their 6th Meeting, held on&apos; May 3rd, 1922, the Committee on the Amalgamation of Services Common to-Navy, Army and Air Force, decided : (a) That Sub-Committees of the Committee be set up to study each of the common ancillary Services individually, and to report a&quot;s to the practicability of amalgamation and as to the savings that could thereby be effected.(6) That a Member of thevCommittee should preside over each Sub-Committee, and that the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry should appoint representatives of their Departments to be Members of each Sub-Committee.In! accordance with the above conclusions a Sub-Committee was set up to inquire into the Works and Buildings Departments, the Terms of Reference of which were as follows : &apos;&apos; To make definite proposals for the amalgamation or, if this appears impossible or undesirable, for the co-ordination so far as possible of the Works and Buildings Departments, in order to reduce the cost of the present triplication. In each case the estimated savings in establishments and other particulars to be shown.&quot;The following were appointed Members of the Sub-Com-mittee : Chairman:The Right Hon.

REPORT.1. In considering the amalgamation of the Works and Build-ings Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force it has been apparent from the outset that if such an amalgamation was decided upon it would be advisable to merge this amalgamated Department into the existing Office of Works rather than to set up a new Department. We have, therefore, directed our inquiries with this aim in view.2. In the course of our inquiries, the Sub-Committee has had the benefit of hearing the views of the following gentlemen : Mr. L. H. Savile, M.I.C.E., A.I.N.A., Civil Engineer-in-Chief, Admiralty. Major-General Sir W. A. Liddell, K.C.M.G., C.B., Directorof Fortifications and Works, War Office. Major-General Sir A. M. Stuart, K.C.M.G., C.B., Directorof Works and Buildings, Air Ministry. Sir Lionel Earle, X.C.B., K.C.V.O., C.M.G., Secretary,H.M. Office of Works. Sir Frank Baines, C.B.E., M.V.O., H.M. Office of Works.3. It has been pointed out to the Committee that approxi-mately half the total expenditure by the Navy, Army, and Air Force under the heading of &quot; Works .and Buildings Depart-ments &quot; is required for Works, etc., Overseas, whereas that of the Office of Works mainly relates to buildings and installations in Great Britain.4. As regards the Navy a large proportion of the work in the dockyards is of a highly technical nature and should remain in the hands of the Admiralty. Apart from the &quot; Works &quot; in the dockyards, the building work done by the Admiralty is of little . magnitude and does little more than ensure that the technical staff is given full employment when not fully engaged on works of a technical nature.5. The Royal Engineers, who are employed by the War Office on building works, are part of the military organisation that would be required in time of war and therefore must be retained in peace. Of those stationed at home, allowance must be made for the per-, formance of military training and duties, including the care and maintenance of military technical stores and equipment. The home establishment in peace is based upon the numbers required to complete establishment in war, and to provide reliefs for garrisons abroad in time of peace. Even if the building work at home was transferred to another Department, the existing peace establishment must be maintained. Useful employment for the Royal Engineers is provided by the type of works with which the War Office at present is chiefly concerned, namely, the. erection and maintenance of hutted camps and -semi-permanent buildings.39463
6. It must be borne in mind that the buildings required by the fighting Services are scattered and often of a temporary nature. Their personnel is essentially fluctuating and on the move as corn-pared to that for which the Office of Works is accustomed to make provision. In the former case far more supervision and inspection is necessary to ensure the efficient maintenance of buildings and to enforce the regulations which control the occupation of barracks, etc.7. Apart from the school at Halton and the new accommodation being erected in Iraq, the bulk of the work carried out by the Air Ministry consists of maintenance and repairs to plant, etc. The Air Ministry is in a similar position to the War Office in that their works staff at home is closely interwoven with the staff employed abroad.8. It has also been pointed out to us that the Works and Build-ings Departments of the fighting Services are intimately bound up with their engineering and other Departments this is par-ticularly the case as regards work in the Naval Dockyards. If the Works and Buildings Departments were transferred to another Office administrative difficulties would arise, particularly as regards the responsibility in respect of the designi and execution of works; the settlement of priority of execution; and the preparation of schemes, etc.   *9. After careful consideration of the possibility of the &quot;Works &apos;&apos; for the Navy, Army and Air Force being handed over to the Office of Works, the Sub-Committee are of opinion that, in view of the technical nature of a large proportion of the work, only a small proportion could be handed over. A partial amalgama-tion of this description would tend to increase the administrative difficulties -pt the Departments, and inevitably cause an increase in the Office of Works Vote which would not be balanced by real and substantial economies in the other Departments owing to the necessity for the retention of staffs to deal with the technical work and for the retention of the Boyal Engineers for military reasons.CONCLUSIONS.10. For the reasons given above, we are of opinion that co-ordination rather than amalgamation shows the greater promise of effective economies.11. With a view to the formation of proposals to bring about an increase in the co-ordination between the Departments concerned, at our request the executive officers of the Works and Buildings Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force and Office of Works have presented a joint report (Appendix I) showing the measure of co-ordination at present existing, and making suggestions for its furtherance.12. We agree that co-ordination between the Office of Works and the three fighting Services should be assured by extending
the activities of the existing Contracts Co-ordination Committee of the three fighting Departments and the Office of Works in respect of contracts, supply of stores, &amp;c.The resources of the various Departments, in respect of advice and assistance on special technical matters for which - they maintain an expert staff, should be made available to the other Government Departments. The formation of a Joint Council composed of members of the Departments would provide a means for the distribution of the knowledge and experience which had been gained in building work. The services of this Council might be of use to further the extension of the system of utilising other Departments, including the Works Department of Colonial Governments, to act as agents for the execution of work where this method can be conveniently and economically employed.13. We recommend that, before building schemes of magnitude are commenced in the United Kingdom by Departments other than the Office of Works, a special investigation should take place with at view to ascertaining whether economies would not ensue if the work was entrusted to the latter Department.(Signed)  Alfred Mond (Chairman).

October 17th, 1922.ANNEXURE I.REPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE HEADS OF THE WORKS AND BUILDINGS BRANCHES OF THE ADMIRALTY, WAR OFFICE, AIR MINISTRY yAND H.M. OFFICE OF WORKS, DATED 29th JULY, 1922. In accordance with&apos; the decision made at the second meeting of the Sub-Committee under the Right Honourable Sir Alfred Mond, Bart., M.P., we, the Executive Officers of the Depart-ments attending the Sub-Committee, have considered the ques-tion of co-ordination and amalgamation of our various staffs and activities at meetings held on July 18th, 22nd, 25th and 26th, and submit a joint Report.1. Information has been furnished by His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works as to the relative cost in that Department of the Staff to Expenditure on Work, on a basis approximating to that which has been adopted in the Reports by the Service Departments to the Sub-Committee. The statement is attached to this Report, marked J.
2. In this Report we have dealt solely with the technical and economical sides of&apos; the question. The broader administrative question of principle involved, namely, the control and supervision by the various Departments of their own activities, in respect of financial matters (estimating, budgeting, and accounting for expenditure); their responsibility in respect of the design and execution of works; the settlement of priority of execution; and the preparation of schemes, etc., which are of the highest im-portanee to all concerned, are matters outside the scope of our present reference and must be dealt with by the members of the Sub-Committee representing the various Departments of State.3. We have, however, made every attempt to investigate the matter fully, within the limited time available, and to arrive at a conclusion which will be satisfactory to the Departments con-cerned from a technical point of view and to indicate such measures aswill effect economy, where such is practicable.Co-ordination.4. The three fighting Services already co-ordinate to a con-siderable extent in respect of the design of works and supply of stores and the equipment of barracks, etc.The synopsis of accommodation to be provided for the personnel of the Army and of the Royal Air Force is the same in its essen-tial particulars. The scale of illumination and water supply is the same, subject to minor variations. The general regulations governing the construction and maintenance of rifle ranges and magazines are applicable to all three Services.Designs and plans are interchanged between the Works De-partments of the Services.In regard to the execution of works the War Department and Ah Ministry use the same schedule of rates for maintenance Services earned out by contract. Running contracts are made by the War Office for stores and the various articles of equipment . for barracks, which are equally available for the Works Depart-nients of the Navy and Royal Air Force and are used by these Departments.Execution of work by the Agency of another Department.5. Co-operation in respect of the execution of work has already taken place and still takes place to a considerable extent, and would be adopted in any case in which such course appeared desirable, as the Heads of the Departments concerned are in close touch with each other.
Instances of co-operation at present taking place between the Service Departments, etc., are : Home Stations.Shoeburyness and Isle of Grain. War Office for Admiralty and Air Ministry, in connection with Artillery ranges and experimental work.Woolwich. War Office for Admiralty, in respect of building Services, and Admiralty for the War Office in connection with a pier and dredging.Ireland.Dublin.  War Office for Air Ministry accommodation. Aldergrove. Air Ministry for War Office accommodation.Malta,.Admiralty for Air Ministry, all works. Ceylon.War Office for the Admiralty. Iraq.Air Ministry for military garrison, all work.   Prior to 1921/22 all works, including those for the Eoyal Air Force, were executed by the War Office. Colonial Stations (numerous).Admiralty for the Colonial Office. Repairs and niain-tenance of W/T stations.6. The Office of Works are carrying out works as agent for the Admiralty at Bandeath (accommodation for police and Chilian workmen) and London (Albany Street garage maintenance).The Admiralty are constructing cable stores for the Post Office at Dover.In Palestine the Civil Public Works Department is now under-taking all works for the garrison, including the Royal Air Force. The Director of Works isa Royal Engineer officer, and the present works organisation consists mainly of Royal Engineer personnel. Prior to 1921/22, the War Office earned out all works for fighting troops.Hong Kong. Should an extensive scheme of barrack accoiri-modation mature, it is probable that the work will be entrusted to the agency of the local Public Works Department.The Admiralty have also given consultative service in connection with the Peterhead Harbour of Refuge ( 1,592,147) and its main-tenance ( 25,000) for the Board of Trade, are constructing build-ings and oil installation at Simons Town for the Union govern -ment of South Africa and are giving consultative advice to the Office of Works regarding Alderney Breakwater, and regarding harbours in the Isle of Man for the Home Office, in addition to several schemes for harbours for the Colonial Government of Australia.7. The special and individual activities of the various Depart-ments, and also those functions which are common to some or all
of them are pictured in the attached tabular statement marked K, which should be interpreted in conjunction with the following remarks: 8. Although the functions of the various Departments cover certain common ground in relation to the provision of accbmmoda-tion, and subsidiary services in connection therewith, the installa-tion of.electricity, etc., the conditions in which these functions are exercised are in most cases (except in the case of the War Office and Air Ministry) mainly of a totally dissimilar character.9. A considerable portion of the work of the Army and Eoyal Air Force in respect of accommodation lies in foreign countries, whereas that of HisMajesty&apos;s pffice of Works mainly relates to&apos; buildings and installations of a special character in Great Britain. The duties of the Works Department of the Admiralty in this respect are relatively small in comparison to those which they undertake in connection with dock and harbour work, and except in respect of coastguard and wireless telegraphy stations relate to branches in close proximity to dockyards.10. Again, the type of personnel to be accommodated is different in each case. Whereas the Office of Works provides for personnel which may be termed stationary and constant in numbers, that of the fighting Services is essentially fluctuating and is always on the move, more especially in the case of the Army.In the latter case far more supervision and inspection is neces-sary to ensure the efficient maintenance of buildings and to enforce the regulations which control the occupation of barracks, etc., the use of Government land, and the supply of stores, water, . illuminants, etc.11. The cash^expenditure on the various classes of work under-taken by the Department is shown below : Admiralty. Of a total of  2,100,000 included for constructional works in the Budget Estimates for 1922/23,  1,600,000 repre-sents the expenditure on special technical new works at home and abroad, not including magazine and factory buildings amounting to  280,000. Similarly, of a total of  500,000 in-cluded for maintenance,  345,000 represents the cost of main-tenance of such special works and dockyards.War Office.-The probable total cash expenditure for the current year is now estimated to be as follows : 	- At Home.

The costed figure in the Army Estimates, 1922-&quot;23, is  501,000. t D.F.W.&apos;s branch at War Office.13. This statement is based on information furnished to the Sub-Committee, but the basis of calculation in each case is not similar, owing to&apos; the varying conditions of employment, the varying charges to works accounts, methods of carrying out works, which is clearly illustrated in the table in paragraph 12 by the different proportions of headquarters staff to the whole establishment, and quality and value of materials employed. An accurate comparison could only be made after detailed examina-tion and investigation; allowance for the extraneous duties per-formed by the various staffs and appraisement of the necessity for closer supervision in carrying out certain classes of work.14. It should be noted that a very large amount of extraneous work has to be carried out by the staff which is not reflected in actual expenditure. In all Departments schemes have to be prepared for works which never mature, and to this-extent the work of the staff is therefore without its corresponding result of expenditure. In the case of the Office of Works it is pointed . out that very extensive advisory and. valuation services and investigations are performed for the Treasury and other Depart-ments, such as the enquiry and valuation of China concessions, selections of sites for buildings, valuations, surveys of historic buildings, parliamentary work, State ceremonies. Similar work is performed, perhaps, in a lesser degree by all the works staffs of&apos; Departments.15. Of the cost of the War Department staff three-quarters is that of military personnel, and allowance must be made for the performance of military duties, including the provision, care and maintenance of military technical stores and equipment, for military training, and for the fact that the. personnel being part of a military organisation cannot be adjusted individually, and solely in relation to the work in hand, because of the necessity to maintain a large proportion of the staff to complete establishment
in war, to provide reliefs for garrisons abroad, and to suit the1 military organisation in time of peace. In a modified degree these conditions apply to the works staff of the Air Ministry.Conclusions and Recommendations.16. Having regard to the various considerations which are enumerated in paragraphs 8-10 and 13-15 above, we are unable to indicate, on the information which is before us, any specific measure of amalgamation which will produce material economy in works. As individual officers we have not the necessary knowledge of the working and requirements of the other Depart -ments to justify such a recommendation.17. We consider that further co-ordination between the fighting Services, may be found desirable in extension of that which already exists; and that similar co-ordination between His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works and the fighting Services should be assured. This might take the form of similar scales of accom-modation, when similar conditions apply, and more uniform procedure in respect of contracts, supply of stores for structural work, etc., wherever this may be applicable.18. The extension of the system of utilising other Depart-ments, including the Works Departments of Colonial Govern-ments, to act as agents for the execution of Services where this method can conveniently and economically be employed, should also be examined, and annual programmes for works might be arranged accordingly by conference between the representatives of the Departments of State concerned.19. Further, the resources of the various Departments, in respect of advice and assistance on special technical matters for which they maintain an expert staff, should be made available and made use of, e.g., architectural treatment, sanitation, coast protection, dock work, etc., for the benefit of all other Govern-ment Departments, and machinery should be provided to this effect.20. As regards the transference between Departments of duties in connection with works, we are in agreement that no advantage would be gained by the transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works of any services now administered by the Service Departments in places outside the United Kingdom. It is, however, claimed by the representative of the Office of Works that considerable economy would result if building schemes of magnitude in the United Kingdom, especially those which involve important architectural treatment were entrusted -to that Department for execution, since that is the class of work for&apos; which they are especially organised. Examples of such work would be the Dartmouth College, the proposed Royal Air Force Cadet School at Cranwell, and a large barrack scheme, such ns that at Redford. 391B3 Q 2

APPENDIX V.COST OP THE TRANSPORT DEPARTMENTS OF THE NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE.1. Letter from the Secretary to the Sub-Committee to the Secretaries of the Admiralty, Was .Office and AirMinistry.5/Z/39.May 25th, 1922.Sir,1. I am directed to state that Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee on the Amalgamation of the Transport Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force desire to have before them a complete Statement giving the general outline of the mechanical trans-port and horse transport organisations of the three Services, and to request that you will be so good as to have the inforrha-tion asked for below prepared.2. As regards mechanical transport, the general outline pro-vided by the War Office should review the organisation by Com-niands, including the repair depots and capacity of such depots in each Command. The Air Ministry&apos;s general outline should similarly differentiate between the inland and coastal areas, so that it may be superimposed on the War Office review. The Admiralty&apos;s general outline should give a sketch of the small mechanical transport organisation now remaining in their charge.3. In addition to the outline dealing with organisation and establishment of the mechanical transport, a statement should be prepared showing the total expenditure on mechanical transport under two headings : (a) The expenditure on purchases   (including repairs)from either contractors or Royal establishments and factories.(b) The   expenditure on   the establishments concernedwith the obtaining of the above-mentioned supply. This should show under separate headings, as far as practicable, the requisitioning staff, the experi-mental design and technical staff, the contracts and purchase staff, the inspection. staff and accounting staff, but should exclude storage and distribution. The clerical staff should be included in each case in their own department.4. The Sub-Committee appreciate the fact that it may not be possible in every case to make a useful sub-division as indicated above, and, in this case, certain groupings and qualifying state-ments may be necessary.   In view of this, the Sub-Committee
consider , that the value of the statements would be greatly enhanced if representatives of the three Departments could arrange to meet so as to draw up uniform headings and sub-divisions for the separate statements.5. Owing to the existence of a similar Sub-Committee on the Amalgamation of the Supply Departments, the Sub-Committee . have decided that certain items which are really items of Trans-port should be dealt with by the Supply Sub-Committee and vice versa. In accordance with this decision, the following items should be omitted from the mechanical transport state-ments referred to above : Petrol and all oils.6. As regards horse transport, since the War Office is the only Department concerned and there can be no question of over-lapping with other Departments, it is requested that the War Office will prepare a separate statement on similar lines to the -one in paragraph 3 above ; this statement should include expendi-ture on all kinds of horses, saddlery, harness and forage, but not horse vehicles, which are included in the Supply Statement.7. The sub-Committee realise that considerable labour will be involved in the compilation of the above Statements, but, as their preparation is essential before the Sub-Committee&apos;s inquiries can be prosecuted further, it is earnestly hoped that the Admiralty     jWar Office [will be able to arrange to have the Statements Air Ministry jsubmitted by Wednesday, the 7th June, so that they may be reproduced, circulated and duly considered before the next meeting, which the Chairman desires to hold on Thursday, the loth June, at 11 a.m.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   C. W. G. Walker,Secretary to the Sub-Committee.2,. Whitehall Gardens, S.W.2. Letter from the Admiralty to the Secretary to the Sub-Committee.12th June, 1922.N.S. Dept.N.S.M.T. 435/11795.As requested in your letter of 25th ultimo, No; 5/Z/39, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to enclose for the information of Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee on
the Amalgamation of the Transport Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force (a) A memorandum showing briefly a general outline of thesmall motor transport organisation now remaining to the Admiralty.(b) A statement showing the expenditure provided for1922-23 in respect of purchases from contractors. (e) A statement  showing  the expenditure provided for 1922-23 for the establishments concerned in obtaining purchases at (b).I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed)   V. W. Baddelby.The Admiralty Motor Transport Organisation is briefly as follows : Headquarters.A small sub-section of the Naval Store Department (at present three persons) dealing with the general administra&apos;-tion of the service and the regulation of supplies.London Garage.A pool of vehicles, mostly lorries, engaged in (a) Routine rounds between Admiralty Departmentshoused in buildings in various parts of London for maintaining prompt circulation of official papers.(b) Transport of baggage of ratings passing throughLondon and any other miscellaneous and urgent transport work.(c) Conveyance of medical cases through London.(d) Conveyance of passengers where, on account of reasons of urgency, number of places to bevisited, or other special reasons, public travellingfacilities are unsuitable. A small repair workshop for (1) Keeping  London  pool of vehicles in  a soundmechanical condition. (2) Reconditioning vehicles returned from service priorto re-allocation. . (3) Undertaking large repairs to vehicles beyond theresources of outports. (4) Repair of spare parts.(5) Survey and inspection of new purchases of vehicles and spare parts and supervision of contract repairs.A central store for supply and distribution of spare parts for all commands. Outports.A pool of vehicles in each of the large dockyards for handling transport of material in the port and for a very
limited amount of passenger work under similar conditions to those outlined above.The general principle followed in all commands is to bring all vehicles in the port under a central organisation, to under-take the work of all Departments at the port.Where geographical conditions do not admit of pooling vehicles for all services, a limited number of vehicles is allocated to each establishment concerned for carrying, out its normal internal work, the central pool of vehicles being relied upon for any abnormal work beyond the resources of the establishment&apos;s vehicles.The central organisation in each port is under the manage-ment of the local Naval Store Officer, and no additional charges for administration of motor transport at outports are thus incurred.No special repair depots are arranged at the outports, but a small staff of mechanics is borne for the purpose of keeping the vehicles in a mechanically sound condition and to under -take minor repairs and overhauls.Foreign Depdts.At the permanent dockyards a small number of vehicles are run under similar conditions to the outports at home.In addition to these, there are a number of isolated stations, e.g., wireless stations, oil depots, &amp;c., where no public facilities exist and where Service motor transport is the only means of maintaining communication with the nearest town. Special Services.A few vehicles are still engaged in the service of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control. The number of vehicles and the mechanics employed specifically for motor transport work are shown on the sub-enclosure.The work of the vehicles is under periodical review, and reduc-tions in the complements allocated to the several ports are effected as soon as circumstances are considered to warrant this course. An officer from Headquarters is specifically charged with this duty, and visits home outports periodically to co-ordinate working arrangements and review organisation.STATEMENT SHOWING- THE EXPENDITURE PROVIDED IN RESPECT OP PURCHASES.

STATEMENT  SHOWING&apos; EXPENDITURE PROVIDED FOR    ESTABLISHMENTS    CONCERNED    WITH ,i   PURCHASES.The expenditure provided for 1922-3 for the establishments con-cerned in obtaining the above-mentioned supplies is shown below under the heads in which it is most conveniently divided and, in the parallel column, is shown the estimated proportion of the expenditure assigned to the heads specified in the letter under reply. It is difficult to furnish the precise amounts under these heads, as the small organisation does not admit of separate staff being allocated to them, e.g., the Technical Officer is responsible, not only for experimental design and technical work, but also for inspection, for management of the repair workshop, for technical advice on tenders and contracts, and for general technical supervision over the operation of vehicles at outports, and the survey and preservation of stocks of spare parts.

Paper No. 2), requesting to be furnished with a statement show-
jig the general outline and cost of the mechanical transport and horse transport organisation of the War Office for the information of Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Committee on the Amalgamation of the Transport Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force, I am commanded by the Army Council to forward copies of a memorandum which has been prepared accordingly.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  H. J. Greedy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 19th June, 1922.ARMY EXPENDITURE ON TRANSPORT, 1922-1923.REMOUNT DEPARTMENT. Purchasing Organization.Great Britain (includes Rhine).Speaking generally, all horses for the Army at home are purchased by two officers, called respectively &quot; Inspector of Remounts (Cavalry) &quot; and &quot; Inspector of Remounts (Artillery).&quot;The former purchases riding horses and the latter all horses for the artillery and draught horses for other arms.These officers receive their instructions direct from the Director of Remounts at the War Office, and it should be noted that their duties are not limited to purchasing; they have heavy inspection duties in addition.Their emoluments are  500 per annum plus Civil Service war bonus.In a normal year, to make good the annual wastage, we expect to have to purchase about 10 per cent, of the establishment of animals.. As animal establishments stand at present, this means approxi-mately 1,700 animals for the Home Army.     -      ,Purchases are made in the open market no contracts of any sort are made. Before the War practically all horses were bought through dealers in. Ireland, but an endeavour is now being made to obtain what we require direct from breeders in Great Britain.The maximum price for each class of horse is fixed from time to time by the War Office in accordance with the general trend of prices at the time.A descriptive return of animals purchased is forwarded to the Director of Remounts immediately after purchase is made. This return contains a full description of each animal, its price, destination and the name and address of the vendor.A duplicate of this return is sent to the officer to whom the remounts are sent.
- As soon as a remount reaches its destination the receiving officer reports its arrival to the Director of Remounts, War&quot; Office, who then issues a cheque direct to the vendor for the amount due. The Director of Remounts also pays all expenses prior to joining, such as railway freight, &amp;c.&quot;The Director of Remounts has an imprest account and renders a monthly account to the Finance Branch of the Quartermaster-Generals Department, War Office (Q.M.G.(P)). Charges in this account are supported by the original descriptive returns of animals purchased and vendors&apos; receipts for payments.The purchasing officer is accompanied by a veterinary officer, who certifies each animal purchased as &quot; sound and fit for the Service.&quot;This veterinary officer is either detailed by the D.G.A.V.S. at the War Office, or, if more economical and convenient, the purchaser applies for the services of one from the Command where lie happens to be purchasing.In certain exceptional cases it is necessary to purchase abroad, for instance,1 during the current year we are purchasing 600 mules in U.S.A. On such occasions the Director of Remounts details a specially selected officer to proceed to the U.S.A. to pass the mules, which are supplied under a special contract, according to certain specifications. In such a case as this sea freight is not borne by the Remount, but by the Transport Vote VT.In calculating the total cost of the purchases carried out by the Remount Department, it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line between purchasing and other duties, but it is reasonable to say that in a normal year, with establishments as they now are and at present prices, approximately  120,000 is spent on the actual purchase of horses and  1,000 per annum in staff (including clerking and accountancy) employed in connection with such purchases.Colonial Stations (excluding Egypt and Constantinople).At Colonial stations purchases are carried out by an officer detailed for the duty by the G.O.C. The procedure is much the same as that followed at home, except that payments are made by the local paymaster. These purchases are reported, as they occur, to the Director of Remounts, who is responsible that the amount allotted for Colonial stations is not exceeded. The normal requirements would be approximately 120 animals per annum, say  8,000.Egypt and Constantinople.Up to the present it has not been necessary to purchase specially for these garrisons, reinforcements of animals having been provided from the surplus in Iraq.In future years, if garrisons are maintained at their present strength, it will be necessary to provide some 700 animals per annum to replace wastage.There is no local supply, so that this will entail importation from either Australia or Great Britain under&apos; special arrange-1 ments which will have to be made by the War Office
Organisation of the Mechanical Transport Service of the ... Army.i. At Home.(1) The organisation is designed to provide (i) a maintenance organisation capable of satisfying the essential peace requirements of the M.T. services both at home and overseas in personnel and material.. In addition this maintenance organisation is respon-sible for the safe custody of such equipment of thei ::       Expeditionary Force as is M.T. supply which from ... time to time the Army Council decide to hold in store for purposes of mobilisation; and(ii) a   cadre  basis from which   the M.T. units i required for the Expeditionary Force can be expandedon mobilisation.(2) The M.T. units stationed at home are as shown at Xa. I. In amplification of the latter subjoined are brief explanatory details :-(i) Training.-One Corps M.T. Depot at Aldershot, comprising a Recruit Reception and Training Com-pany, a Driving School Company at Feltham and an Artificers&apos;Training Company at Aldershot, in which are incorporated the necessary workshop training facilities. This depot trains the . driver and artificer recruits, necessary for home and overseas establishments, which latter includes India.(ii) M.T. for General Transport Purposes.-^) M.T. Service Companies which on mobilisation would be required to provide the 34 M.T. Units requisite for an Expeditionary Force of one cavalry division and five divisions. The underlying principle governing the composition of these companies is that,for the nucleus Regular M.T. personnel necessary for an Expeditionary Force a &apos;&apos; cadre&apos;&apos; vehicle establishment of some description is essential wherewith to acquire experience in the handling, operating and maintaining of M.T; as a whole. With but a slight increase to overhead and other charges, these &quot; cadre &apos;* vehicle establishments can in time of peace be so expanded as to furnish suffi-cient vehicles to perform a proportion of the essential peace-time road transport requirements of the Army. Such as cannot be performed by this expanded vehicle establishment are carried out either to a small extent by the horse transpoi-t establishment of the Army, or by hiring. The actual relation which1 these peace cadres bear. to war requirements is approximately as under :-39463

Companies in(iii) Stores and Equipment-One Mechanical Transport Stores Depot, charged with the inspection, receipt, storage and distribution of the current stocks of M.T. spares and stores requisite for the maintenance of the Army&apos;s M.T. both at home and abroad. In addi-tion, this depot holds the stock of M.T. mobilisation equipment requisite for the Expeditionary Force of one cavalry division and five divisions.(iv) Vehicle Reserves. Owe Vehicle Reception Depot at Feltham for the custody of the mobilisation and maintenance vehicle reserves of the Army The former consists of about 600 technical vehicles (partly complete vehicles and partly technical bodies) neces-sary to equip the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation of types which would he unobtainable from the trade in sufficient time . for mobilisation. Among such vehicles are gun tractors, anti-aircraft gun lorries, armoured cars, laboratories, workshop lorries, wireless vans, motor ambulance bodies, etc. The maintenance reserve consists of ordinary load and passenger-carrying vehicles intended to replace vehicle casualties in peace establishments. Its numbers are based at 15 per cent, of the Array&apos;s peace establishment of M.T. vehicles.(v) Repairs.(a) There are no Repair Depots in commands, but each of the 20 companies under (ii) above is provided with an establishment of artificers and a small equipment of machine tools, and is respon-sible for the maintenance and repair of the W.D. vehicles in the command. These units are limited to repairs or overhauls of which the cost will not exceed ; 100, i.e., the class of work which on mobilisation they would be called upon to perform in the field. In&apos; the case -of Overhauls exceeding this amount vehicles are normally withdrawn and replaced, or War Office authority given for the work to be put out to local contract.United Kingdom5251,995* The numbers and classes of vehicles of which these Units are composed are aB shown a&apos;Xa.II. -     . .
(b) There is one &quot;Repair Depot&quot; at present located at Honnslow. It is a &quot; 250-man &quot; shop, and its capacity is six complete overhauls a week. In a normal year the balance of overhauls outside the total capacity of this shop would be put out to, contract (either civilian or Royal factory). Owing, however, to the extent to which the Irish situation necessitated reconditioning of vehicles being undertaken last year, it was possible to give the units under (ii) a fresh start this year in their vehicle establishment. Hence no &quot;contract&quot; repair work has been anticipated for 1922/23.The necessity for the existence of this Repair Depot is :-(1) To carry out a portion of the Army&apos;s heavy repairs.(2) To be available to do special work of an urgent nature which would otherwise be subject to the delays inseparable from following the routine of contract or Royal factory.(3) To give officers and others training and experience in the heavier work which they would have to undertake on mobilisation if serving in Base Repair Shops.ii. Overseas.(1) M T is provided in : &quot;Rhine Army, Black Sea, Egypt, Colonies,on scales fixed according to the circumstances governing each case. The personnel and vehicles so provided therefore bear little relation to the requirements of an Expeditionary - Force, but,are designed to suit the special conditions of the respective areas. The geographical distribution of this personnel and vehicles is as shown at X (b) I. At X (b) II. , -the numbers and classes of vehicles allotted to Overseas stations are shown.(2) Repairs. The system is as described under para. I. (2) (va) except that additional artificers and machine tools are allowed to the M.T. Companies for the performance of heavier repairs and complete overhauls. There are no separate repair depots as such. *(3) Apart from these Overseas commitments the M.T. branch of the R.A.S.C. is responsible for the upkeep of the M.T. personnel establishment in India, consisting of :  150 officers. 1,110 other ranks.
The provision of the reinforcements and drafts requisite for their establishment has a corresponding reaction on the . establishments mentioned under para. I (2) (i).   Responsi-bility for vehicle and maintenance establishments lies with the Government of India. III. In addition to Mechanical Vehicle Establishments at Home and Overseas for purely transport requirements, there is a large number of mechanical transport vehicles allotted in peace to all Arms of the Service, both Regular and Territorial Army, for domestic and training purposes, consisting of among other descriptions of vehicles armoured cars for the Tank Corps, anti-aircraft gun lorries for the Royal Artillery, technical vehicles (including motor cycles for the Signal Service), etc.   These will number : 4,-wheeled.   $-wheeled. &apos; At Home       ...     258 174 .and there is also a small number of vehicles similarly employed Overseas. During the transitional stage R.A.S.C. (M.T.) per-sonnel are being provided for operating certain of these vehicles, though in future this responsibility for driving will, according to present policy, pass to the Arms of the Service concerned.The responsibility for the maintenance and heavy repair, how-ever, of all such &quot; detached &quot; vehicles rest with the R.A.S.C.TV. The expenditure on purchases (including repairs) is as shown on Table X (c): &apos; .   .V. The expenditure on the establishments concerned with para. IV are as shown on Table X (d).X.a.I.

Letter prom the Air Ministry to the Secretary to the Sub-Committee,350948/22/P.E,June 11th, 1922.Sir, In compliance with the request contained in Colonel Walker&apos;s letter.of the&apos;25th ultimo, 5/2/39 (A.S.C. (T.) Paper No. 2), I am commanded by the Air Council to forward herewith copies of each of the following documents.A Memorandum upon the Royal Air Porce organisation of Mechanical Transport.Tabular Statements showing the establishment of Mechanical Transport vehicles and personnel at home and abroad for 1922-23.A Memorandum showing the expenditure proposed in 1922-23 on the purchase and repair of Mechanical Transport vehicles and spares and giving particulars of the cost of the staff employed in connection therewith.I am also to enclose a map showing the organisation of Mechanical Transport establishments at home. (Not repro-duced.) &apos;.-!I am to request that the attention of Lord Weir&apos;s Sub-Com-mittee may be directed to the fact, mentioned in the memor-andiim on expenditure, that the expenditure proposed in 1922-23 does not in any way represent the expenditure which will be incurred when the present stock of vehicles, acquired during the war, is exhausted and normality&apos;is reached.I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  H. MoAnally.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. June IBth, 1922.NOTES ON THE MOTOR TRANSPORT ORGANISATION OP THE ROYAL AIR PORCE.Memorandum for Lord Weir&apos;s Committee.1. Repairs. The Royal Air Porce possesses one motor trans-port repair depot, which is situated at Shrewsbury. Its establishment is &apos; calculated so as to provide for an output of 300 vehicles annually. This depot fulfils three principal functions &apos;:- .   , &apos;    ,&apos;      1(a) It maintains the peace time establishment of motor transport in a state of efficiency by carrying out. such heavy repairs as are beyond the capacity of units.(b) It is a training establishment, wherein mechanics may receive a thorough training in such repairs, particu-&quot; larly in the.case of those specialised types&quot; of-vehicle which are more or less peculiar to the Royal Air Porce.304C3u
(c) It furnishes a pool from which personnel can be drawn in the normal course for reliefs, etc., for the motor transport repair depots overseas, e.g:, in&quot; Egypt and Iraq, and, if it should at any&quot; time be necessary on emergency to despatch an expeditionary force over-seas, it would provide the nucleus of a motor trans-port repair section to accompany such a force.The Air Staff attach particular importance to the second and third of these functions, for the proper fufllment of which the maintenance of this depot is essential, in view of the peculiar dependence of the Eoyal Air Force on its motor transport, and the specialised types of vehicle necessarily employed.The despatch of vehicles to the repair depot is controlled by the Air Ministry, units&apos;with vehicles on their charge which re-quire repairs beyond their capacity reporting the fact to the Air Ministry through the usual channels, and the Air Ministry arranges for the issue of replacements as necessary from store (see below).Apart from vehicles sent by units for repair, there is at Henlow, which is the main motor transport storage centre, a considerable quantity of vehicles requiring repair, and the officer commanding the repair depot at Shrewsbury draws vehicles from Henlow up to his full repair capacity, as opportunity offers. In present circumstances, therefore, the officer commanding the repair depot is in a position to arrange a regular programme of repairs, and there is no considerable fluctuation, in the volume of work. It is, in consequence, probable that the output of vehicles this year will exceed the figure of 300, though in future years some fluctua-tion will be inevitable according to the volume of repairs required by units which in&quot; turn must, of course,, depend on the extent to which they are actively employed.Output is, however, of less importance than training. It is the object of the depot to give the personnel which pass through it an intensive training in every phase of shop work. Every man under training spends a specified period in each shop, being taught in rotation to fit and assemble all components Of each type of vehicle utilised. It is. hoped to turn out at least 200 well-trained fitters annually, thus enabling the motor transport on charge of units to be maintained in a high state of efficiency. Hitherto this motor transport has undoubtedly suffered owing to the shortage of properly trained mechanics, consequent on the rapid demobilisation of the force after the armistice, and&quot; the unsatisfactory manner in which vehicles were repaired at Slough. The conduct of repairs on behalf of the Eoyal Air Force by the Slough Trading Company was found by experience to be at once costly and ineffective.2. Storage.-(&amp;) Complete vehicles. Spare motor transport and reserves are stored centrally under Air Ministry control. The chief storage centre is the Inland Area aircraft depot (which is, of course, maintained in any case for other purposes, storage
of motor -transport being a, secondary function). Some 429 vehicles&apos; are at present stored at, Henlow, of which roughly 50.per.cent, consist of vehicles which have been reconditioned by contractors, and are available for issue to units as required, whilst the remainder consist principally of vehicles withdrawn from units in pursuance of.the decision to reduce squadrons at home from war to peace establishments in the interests of economy. A proportion of this latter category of vehicles is, of course, in need of repair (of. above under heading &quot; Repairs &quot;).All other vehicles at home, not on charge of units, are either stored at the packing depot at Ascot or undergoing repair at the -motor transport repair depot at Shrewsbury. Ascot is main-tained as a depot for the .packing and despatch of aircraft, etc. ,. overseas. At present a large quantity of motor transport is stored here in process of despatch to units in overseas commands, and it is anticipated that some 233 vehicles will be so despatched this year. This will practically complete the re-equipment of the overseas commands of the Royal Air Force with serviceable vehicles, and thereafter it is not intended to utilise Ascot further as a&apos; storage depot for motor transport.(b) Spares. Spares are stored at one of the main Royal&apos;Air Force store depots&apos; at Kidbrooke, and are issued thence to units like any other stores. They constitute, of course, only a very small proportion of the miscellaneous stores for the custody and issue of which this depot is maintained.3. Establishments. Establishments of motor transport are determined either on a station or unit basis. In the Case of immobile units such as store depots, the establishment is fixed to meet local requirements in relation to the geographical situation of the unit concerned, the mature and proximity of railway facilities and similar factors. In the case of mobile units such as service squadrons, the establishment, of motor transport is determined by the type of squadron, i.e., the functions which it has to fulfil, the number and &quot;type of aircraft it comprises, &amp;c.It was recently decided,&apos; in the interests of economy, that service squadrons should function in future with reduced peace establishments of motor transport, the difference- between the number of vehicles necessary in peace and war being withdrawn and held centrally for immediate issue on mobilisation.   &apos;   *The reduced peace establishments of these, mobile units are, like their war establishments,.determined according to the type of squadron, as investigation showed tha-fc the variation of estab-lishments which would be possible if regard were had simply to -local requirements and geographical situation was so small as to be negligible, whilst there are obvious advantages in standardisation, inasmuch as service squadrons may be required to move from station to station at short notice even under normal conditions. The peace establishments allowed are quite insuffi-cient for active service conditions such as subsist, for example,
in Ireland at the&apos; present time, and in cases such as that which arose recently, when a squadron was transferred to Ireland at 24 hours&apos; notice, special provision has to be made. The Air Council are, however, of opinion that in the interests of economy such risk as is inevitably, attendant on the introduction of these reduced peace establishments must be run in the case of units within the United Kingdom.ESTABLISHMENT OF MECHANICAL TRANSPORT AND M.T.

This includes  5,000 carried in from 1921-22.(ii)  75,000 for the purchase of M/T. spares, including 10,000 carried in from 1921-22    -(iii)  55,000 for the purchase of M/T- tyres, including 6,000 carried m from 1921-22&apos;Establishment or Mechanical Transport continued.
The only establishments concerned with the obtaining of M/T. supplies are the Air Ministry and Kidbrooke^ The staff engaged on the various services, together with a statement of their cost, is as shown below : Requisitioning StaffContract and chase Staff.Pur-Inspection Staff  ...Experimental   and Design Staff.Air Ministry.1 Flight Lieutenant ...&quot;) f of their 1 1 Clerk, Grade III ... time) 1 Clerical Officer    ...

The estimates have been framed on the assumption that the whole of the repairs required: during the present financial year will be carried out at the M/T. Repair Depot at Shrewsbury.It is estimated that the Shrewsbury Depot will absorb spares to the value of about  10,000 from store, replacements for which will be found out of the sum of the  75,000 shown under (ii)-above. The corresponding figures for the M/T. Repair Sections in Iraq and Egypt-are  10,000 and  9,000 respectively.In addition to purchases of equipment, expenditure is incurred on the pay and. maintenance&apos; of personnel, accommodation and plant of the M/T. Repair Depot at home and of the Repair Sections in Iraq and Palestine. The annual cost of the pay and maintenance of the personnel of the Shrewsbury establishment is approximately  74,000, but the cost of accommodation and plant cannot be ascertained in the time available. It should, however, be pointed out that Shrewsbury plays a dual .role as a repair depot! and as a training centre for M/T. staff, and that the whole of the above sum is.not chargeable to the cost of repairs.With regard to the figures under (i), (ii) and (iii) above, it may be observed generally that they are in no sense representative of what the expenditure will be in a. normal year. Since the Armistice the Royal Air Force have been utilising part of the large stocks purchased during the war, and heavy replacements will be required as the vehicles at present in use become unserviceable.
