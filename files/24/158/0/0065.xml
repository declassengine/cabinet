THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS 3RITANNI0 MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT.CABINET.THE   BILL   TO   AMEND   THE   TRADE   UNION   ACT   OF   1913, WITH   REGARD   TO   POLTTICAI   LEVIES.MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER   OF   LABOUR.(1)   The question of amonding the Trade Union Act of1913 was referred to hy the prime Minister in one of his speeches prior to the Eleotion.     What he said (&quot;Times&quot;,November 8th) was as follows&quot;Mr. Asquith said that it is as certain as that the sun will rise tomorrow that if there is a Conservative majority it will destroy the possibility of political aotion by the Trade Unions.     We have no Buch intention.It was proposed that members of trade unions should not be compelled to pay to tho political funds of a party with which they did not agree.     That seems reasonable.   But we are going to have no rash action about it.     Before we dreamt of dealing with it, we should consult&quot; both trade union leaders and the employers]&quot;    and if we have to do anything, we should certainly try to get an arrangement that seemed fair to reasonable members of trade unions&quot;.I had discussed this subjeot with the prime Ministerprior to his speech and had agreed with him the policy as outlined in the above quotation.(2)   I understand that Private Members on the Conserva-tive side are now pressing the Chief Whip with regard toputting down, if they are successful in the ballot, a Billto amend the Act of 1913.    Presumably the Bill, if introduoedwould be on the lines of the Bill whioh secured a secondreading last Summer, backed by Sir George Younger and ColonelMeysey Thompson.     The effect of this Bill was, amongst other things, to alter the presumption with regard to political levies.Under the present Act, if a Trade Union decides on a politicallevy, any member of the Union who desires not to pay is
required to give explicit notice Le. in effect, to &quot;contract out&quot;.     Tha offoot of the Bill would have toon that no member need pay a levy unless he explicitly agreed to do so;    in other words, those willing to pay would &quot;contract In&quot;. There were other provisions but this was the main basis of the Bill.     Tho proceedings in Committee were somewhat disorderly and the labour representatives contestod the Bill Clause by Clause.     The Government remained neutral. The Bill got through the Committee stage but there was no time to set it down for further consideration in the House.(3)   I very muoh hope that it may not be necessary to press the matter on during the present Session;   and I would muoh prefer that the whole question should stand over for tha time being.(4)   If, howevor, the Prime Minister should decide that it is Impossible to arrange this, It seems to me to be most desirable that the policy to be adopted by the Government should be carefully considered in advance. There are tho two following alternative courses, both consistent -with the Prime Ministers declaration(a)   One alternative would be for the prime Minister to announce, without waiting for a Bill to be introduced, that he is arranging for an enquiry as indicated in his speech.     There might bo certain advantages in this course, and the Government would then have the matter in hand from the first, and the action would not have been started by a Private Member.     On the other hand, the Government would undoubtedly incur the direct odium of having initiated the movement - a movement which,, of course, will be hailed as a challenge to Trade Unionism and to &quot;labour&quot; generally,     There are,
h Pit seems to me, considerable advantages in first ^ &apos;Jhaving a discussion in the House of Commons and in ensuring that publicity is given to the whole matter before tho Government accepts the necessity for an enquiry.accordingly I favour the following procedure (b)   Presumably private Members interested in the Bill Will ballot, and within a comparatively short time of the meeting of Parliament they will probably get an opportunity to introduce the Bill.-    Discussion on Second Reading should than disclose tho case for the Bill and, in view of the Labour opposition in the House, there will probably be strong criticism of the Bill, and tho case on which it purports to be based will be fully canvassed.     I entirely agree that if cases of oppression can be substantiated then the position outlined in the prime Minister&apos;s speech Is unanswerable.     But, frankly, I have never been very fully satisfied that the alleged oppression has been effectively demonstrated..     However, the facts as regards this would probably be more fully elucidated on a Second Reading of the Bill in the present House than has occurred up to date.     I think that in the course of the Second Reading debate the Government should remain neutral with regard to the Bill, but if in the course of tho Debate it appears that a case is really made out for enquiry, then the Government, on the lines of the prime Minister&apos;s declaration, might announce their willingness to appoint an authoritative Commission or a Select Committee (preferably, I think, tho former) to enquire into the whole position.   The
Government would then not be taking aotion with regard to an enquiry till after a substantial pr&apos;raa facie case had been made out for it in the House of Commonsoflntd)   Mn BsMinistry of labour.1st February j 1923.
