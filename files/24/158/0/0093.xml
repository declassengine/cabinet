/h/* 5&amp;U    TilITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF girls&apos; BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).IC.P. 92 (23J..CABINET.VALUATION,AND RATING REFORM. Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In accordance with Cab. 3(23), Conclusion 1 (b), I circulate herewith a Treasury Report on the Extent to which contributions could be made by the Road Fund to the local authorities in rural areas in respect of the main-tenance of third-class roads.(Intld)   S.B.Treasury Chambers,10th February, 1923.
RE P 0 R -T,The estimated annual revenue of the Road Fund was given in the Ministry of Transport Memorandum C6!J,511   as about  12,0.00,000 proviaiunailly.,allocated aa follows(1) Payments to Local Taxation Account) and local authorities in lieu of ) carriage licence duty and fees for) licensing )       535,000(2)   Costs of collection   . 330,000(3)   Grants for maintenance and )improvement of Class I and Class II) Roads and Bridges ) 9,000,000(4)   Grants towards loan charges )incurred by local authorities )       30,000(5)   Surveyor&apos;s Salaries and Census 525,000(6)   Administrative Expenses (Road )Department) )     140,000(?)   Reserved fcr grants to unclassified)roads and bridges and to meet )special cases . )     500,000(8)   Applicable to unemployment schemes     1,000,000 11,990,000At present the  1,000,000 per annum margin for unemployment schemes is hypothecated up to and Including 1926.
It will be seen from this table ;(a) that  500,000 per annum is already-available for assistance to third class roads and bridges and other special cases;(b) that further assistance could, be afforded inthe following ways(i)    By the growth of revenue beyond growth of charges on the Fund,(ii)    By the reduction of the amount set aside for unemployment; so spreading the present liabilities over a longer period.(iii)   By the reduction of the grants formaintenancee!and improvement of roads now in Classy I and II.* *     Growth orevenue beyond growth of charges.Sufficient experience has not yet been gained to support any assumption that the revenue of the Fund will grow more rapidly than the present charges upon itj especially as the outlook is complicated bv (a) proposals for a reversion to the eld system of a tax on fuel as the main source of revenue of the Fund, and (b) proposals (in CP.44/23) for the diversion to the Exchequer of the surplus revenue above a certain figure.II.     Reduction of the allocation for Unemployment.It would hardly be prudent to hypothecate surplus revenue from the Road Fund for much more than four years&apos; ahead having regard to the very uncertain outlook for the national finances and the possibility of new conditions arising which might cause the surplus to disappear entirely. For example, at the present rate of growth of the world consumption of petroleum and its products, it is quite conceivable that within a few years consumption mayexceed/
exceed the available supplies,   This would oause a sharp.rise in prices, and a general curtailment of motor traffic;unless suitable and cheap substitutes are discovered inthe meantime.   Any further spreading of the unemploymentexpenditure would of course involve additional temporaryadvances to the Fund from the Sxohequer,III,   Reduction of thgjsaintenancerrantfor roade now i.n Piffles ,1 5s5. 51.*The present scheme of grants for road maintenancomay be said to have had its origin in the recommendationsof the Departmental Committee on local Taxation 1911-14.Their recommendations in regard to this, as to othersemi-national services, wore, based mainly on the principleof dividing the cost of providing the servioe in any area between the local community and the nation as a whole withreference to their respeotivo interests in the service.Thus in tho oase of main roads tho proportion of non-localuser was the dominant   consideration.They recommended a threefold classification of roads outside London and the County boroughs.(l)   Main roadgt   charged as to one half pn the countyrate and one half on the State.(2)   County rqads.ohargea as to one half on thedistrict rate and the other half divided equally between the county and tho State.Dletriot rcfids, charged wholly on the districtrate.Such an arrangement was thought to be inequitable in the county boroughs (and London) where the local traffic wholly submerges the through traffic even on the most important main roads, and it was proposed that grant-aided
The rosult is that whereas the Local Taxation Committee anticipated that only  200,000 out of their estimated total maintenance grants of  2,400,000 would go to London and the County Boroughs, i.e. one twelfth;   these towns reoeived in 1921-22    1,478,347 out of  7,239,637 for England and vVsles, or just over one-fifth and this notwith-standing that in the distribution of Road Eund money forunemployment schemes to the extent of  4,405,916 in 1021/22,a 1,233,011 went directly to these towns, and/furtherroads in these oases should be limited to the continuance . of outside main roads to a suitable central point, and the amount of the grant should be, not a percentage of the very-high cost of maintenance noerjssitated by intense urban traffio, but a rate per mile representing the average State grant per mile&apos; paid for main roads in the urban portions Of the adjacent administrative county or counties.The predent scheme of maintenance grants from the Road Fund provides&apos; simply for grants of 50$ of the cost of Class I roads, and 35$ of Class II   wherever they are, with no correction of the historic anomalies of the division of charge between county and district&apos; rateB.    It thus starts off with a far more liberal basis of grant to the large towns than the local Taxation Committee proposed, and this is not corrected by a severe restriction of the classes of grant-aided roads in these aroas:-Percentage of total mileage represonted byClass I. Class,II.       Both classesAdministrative Counties outside London and county boroughs 11.9 7.7 19.6County Boroughs 10.5 5,0 15.9London 11.4 5.5 16.9
 1,3-69,000 was expended on road soner.es to provide work solely for London&apos;s unemployed.In.th.is connection the figures as to the area of collection of the revenues of the Eoad Fund are of importance, though these figures probably favour the large towns because of the tendency for country motorists to take out licences in the towns.England &amp; Wales., fev^nue- oolleotoddukak 1931738.  London &amp; County Boroughs ,    4,861,193Administrative Counties 4,4-95,631_3.754,814In view of the above figures as to the collection and distribution of the Fund, it ia not surprising to find that certain administrative count is; claim thai; they pay more towards the Road Fund than they receive from it in grants, although on fundamental principles the Fund should provide -a considerable subsidy from urban motorists, commercial. and pleasure, towards the coat of the country .roads they use,A redistribution of the   Road Fund more in accordance&apos;&apos; with the principles recommended by the Local Taxation Committee ma.y have to be undertaken when the old system of Assigned.Bevenues and Local Taxation Accounts comes up for revision,put in &quot;the meantime it would appear that substantial relief could be afforded to rural areas generally by adopting a far more generous standard in these&apos; areas foracUais-sion to Class II.     Tie mileage in this class in the administrative counties is at present only 10,695 out of the 125,000 miles outside Class 1.This might result in lower percentages than 50$ and 25% having to be adopted for Class I and Class II grants but the Ministry of Transport are in no way committed to the maintenance-of these percentages.
