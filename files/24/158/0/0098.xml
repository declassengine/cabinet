-pOdUlCJlTO JE THE PROPERTY OP HIS 3RITAIWI0 MiJ5STY&apos;S GOVCiUflEHT.fc 0/0-LJL^ , ,,KBT. UNEMPLOYMENT DISUMHGE. &apos; V97(AS). REPORT Q3t&apos; COMklTTIIB.1.     Under existing legislation, benefit may be paid as follows:-(1) Purlng, the.....J;on?tIiirSpecial. Period (2nd November, 1922 --1st July, 19^5) - Up to a maximum number of weeks ranging from 12 to 22 according to circumstances;, (2) From 2nd July, 1925, onvards - Up to maximum of 26 weeks during the Insurance Year (July to July)* 2,    The position, therefore, is that exhaustions of benefit began on 24th January last,     It is estimated that anything up to 120,000 will exhaust benefit by 4th April, and after that date exhaustions will increase rapidly week by week, thereby oreatlng sorious unrest and throwing an incroasod burdon on the Poor Law Authorities,     Moreover, the Unemployment Insurance Acts, as they now stand, will leave large numbers without benefit after a few weeks from 1st. July, 1923*3,     It is proposed, thoroforo, to make a further grant of benefit in the period from  April 18th onwards, and for this purpose immediate legislation will be necessary.4.     The proposals, which havo been agreed with the Treasury, are briefly as follows:-(1) The Fourth Special Period, instead of ending on 1stJuly, 1923, should be extended to 17th October, 1923*   During the-period as thus extended a maximum of 44 weeks of benefit (covenanted or uncovenanted) should be granted, but after 22 weeks have been drawn in any particular case since the beginning of - the FourthISpecial Poriod, there should be a &quot;gap&quot; of a fortnights(2) Tho twelve months from mid-October, 1923, to mid-October,-1924, would bo treated as a benefit year during which a maximum of 26 weeks of benefit (oovenanted or uncovenanted) may be drawn.   In
order to upread thio over a longer period than 26 weeks, individuals would he required to serve a &quot;gap&quot; of three weeks after they had reoeived all covenanted benefit (if any) to which they were entitled, plus twelve v/eeks of uncovenanted benefit, or after twelve weeks of unoov-enanted benefit if they are not qualified for any covenanted benefit.   Twelve weekB is fixed fer this purpose in order that the gap may not arise in any case at or about Christmas.   The Minister of Labour and the Minister cf Health are apprehensive about imposing a gap of longer duration than two weeks, but the Treasury press for at least three weeks.   The Minister of Labour would be prepared to accept three weeks, but only on tho understanding that the Cabinet realise that the point may give rise to difficulty in the House and that they would be prepared to face the issue and adhere to the three weeks.(3)&apos; The additional benefit at present payable at 5s. for a wife and la. for each young child is a temporary provision and is to oease when the &quot;deficiency period&quot; of the unemployment iasur-anoe scheme; ends * (i,e. whan the debt to the Treasury - now  16,500,000 - is paid off and the Unemployment Furl has aooumu-lated aay neoessary reserves); at the same data the rate of contributions is to fall to a figure whioh does not make, provi-sion for this additional benefit,   The additional benefit has amply justified itself and should be made a permanent feature of the insuranoe scheme, a corresponding adjustment being made inthe rate of contributions at the end of the defioienoy period. As from the same date the State contribution to the scheme shouldbe one-fourth of tho joint contribution of employers and employed-the rate fixed in the Aot of 1920 - instead of the rate ofone-third payable under the present omargency Acts.(4)   Two further changes in the Unemployment Insurance scheme are proposed on lines which are being recommended by the interdepartmental Committee presided over by- the CovernmentActuary
(a) The refunds now payable to insured persona at the age of 60 (which are based on the value of their own share of contributions paid, less benefit received) should be abolished for the future, subject to limited compensation in respeot of the contingent.rights of those insured persons who are now aged 50 years or over.   This change is Important (i) for the sake of economy in administration; (ii) because the.system of refunds is hardly consistent with the principle of an insurance scheme; and (Hi) because the liability created by the system is not only very heavy but will tend in the future to absorb a large part of the work-peopled contributions, thus throwing the cost of benefit in large part on the employers and the State.   The amount of compensation payable under the proposals is estimated te be  2,000,000 at a maximum,(b) At present covenanted benefit is limited in the ratio of one week of benefit for every six contributions paid.   It is proposed to substitute a, now- rule undor which the number of weeks of benefit would bo assessed according to the average number of contributions -paid in the - three preceding insurance years..   This change would not come into effect till the period beginning mid-October,1923, and the normal scale of contributions qualifying for various periods of benefit should probably be relaxed during the first two or three years of its operation, owing to- the abnormal unemployment which has prevented large numbers of insured persons from having the opportunity to pay contributions.This change, coupled with the abolition cf refunds at 60, will enable a. substantial economy in.administrative expenses to be effected.
5.      The above proposals.:will involve a gradual inorease in the debt of the Unemployment JTiind from its present figure of  16,500,000 to a figure which (on the assumption that the. average numbers unemployed remain as high as 1,250,000 during the next 16pounds, reducing to 23 or 24 millions by ,mid-October, 1924-; the maximum borrowing power of the Unemployment fund is 30 millions.There will be no increase in the present yearly amount of the1   \     &apos;&apos; vi&amp; M;t;;^W:-%    -   /      &apos;. l&apos; &quot;       -&quot;V-.&quot;.&apos;-&apos;; ;; - &apos;&quot;HXcharge on the Exchequer, but in consequence of the present proposalsthis charge will of course have to be continued for a somewhatlonger period, since the sum borrowed must be paid off by means ofa continuance of the present high rates of contributions from employers, workmen and the State.   After the end of the deficiency -period, the State contribution will be reduced both on account ofthe lower total contributions then necessary and because the ratio of the State contribution to the Joint contributions of employersand employed is to be one-fourth instead of the present ratio ofone-third,HOTE:- A further point with which the Minister of labour hopes to be able to deal in the Bill now proposed is that of giving effect to the reoommendation made by Lord chelmsford and approved by the late Government that any Local Education Authority which so desires should be permitted to-have the sole administration of a choice of Employment Scheme for boys and girls under 18 years of age provided that it arranges also to administer unemployment bene-fit in respect of these boys and girls on lines satisfactory to the Ministry of Labour.   This matter is now being considered by the Minister of Labour&apos; in consultation with the President of the Board of iiducation, . / vl       v       ijmonths) is estimated to reach at its maximum 25 or 26 million
