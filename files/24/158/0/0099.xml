Report by the Committee on the placing of contracts in this country by local authorities.The Committee oh Unemployment have considered the (Question of the placing of Contracts in this country by Government Department and local authorities.     As regards the first class of case, the Committee are awaiting communications from the Government Departments concerned.     As regards the contracts of local authorities,, it was on the one hand represented that;, while local authorities should not, when spending their own money, be prevented from placing contracts abroad, if they saw advantage In doing so, yet all possible pressure should be placed upon them to prevent, them from doing so, except in cases in which there was evidence that the price quoted had been artificially raised against the local authority by something in the nature of a &quot;ring&quot; of contractors.     On the -other hand, it was represented that, with local authorities spending the ratepayers&apos; money, a substantial difference of price alone, whatever its cause, and even though it should be due to the comparative lowness of cost of production abroad, and not to the existence of a &quot;ring&quot; here, was in itself a sufficient reason for placing contracts abroad; and that it would be not only wrong, but futile, to attempt to induce authorities (except in cases in which they were financed wholly, or partly, from Government sources), to place contracts in this country at a substantial loss to themselves.Eventually it was decided to recommend to the Cabinet (1) that, on the analogy of the conditions attached to guarantees given under the Trade Facilities Acts, localauthorities/
authorities should he required to place within this country all contract in1 relation to relief works assisted hy Government grantsj(2) that f6r the present and so long as the present acute unemployment lasts in the absenoe of very special circumstance^, local authorities should be required to place in this country all other contracts ih relation to works assisted&quot; by Government grants, i.-e*i contracts in relation to the Ordinary work of the authoritiesj(3) that, as regards works not assisted by Government grants, local authorities should be urged to place all contracts in this country in the absence of such special circumstances as material excess of British over foreign prices; and that a circular letter on these lines should be issued to local authorities at an early date.The President of the Board of Trade dissented from the words &quot;in the absence of such special circumstances as material excess of British over foreign prices&quot; in paragraph 3 of the above conclusion, which in his view should read simply &quot;in the absence of very special circumstances&quot;.If the loop-hole of simple price difference were given every local authority could justify their action on that ground.     In the Presidents view the special circumstances which should absolve local authorities from.placing contracts in this country would be not so much a difference in.price caused by unavoidable difference- in British end foreign working costs but such cases as an artificial maintenance of prices against the consumer by &quot;a ring&quot;:   or a shortage of British material.A. .G..
