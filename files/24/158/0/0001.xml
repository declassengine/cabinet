(This document is the property of His Britanhio Majesty&apos;s Government.)0 R E T.CABINET.m5HOME AFFAIRS C0M1.1ITTEE.SPECIAL CONSTABLES BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary,It is desirable to pass at the earliest possible date a Bill to revive the provisions cf the Special Constables Act,  1914.The Special Constables Act of 1831 only authorises the swearing in of Special Constables when a &quot;tumult, riot or felony has taken place or may be reasonably apprehended&quot; and neither this Act nor the provisions in Section 196 of the Municipal Corporations Act,  1882, requiring the Justices ts appoint Special Constables each year (a requirement which in most boroughs is a dead letter) provide the necessary machinery for organising a standing force of Special Constables as a police auxiliary. In 1914 a Special Constables Act was passed enabling Special Constables to be appointed apart from any immediately apprehended disturbance, and regulations to be made by Order in Council for their government and control, but the power to appoint Special Constables under this Act came to an end on 31st August last.   It was, I understand, intended to continue the power by means of the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill, but at the last moment it was found that there were technical difficulties which would prevent this being done and there was no time for a special Bill, At the present moment, although the provisions cf the Act of 1914 and the Order in Council made thereunder continue to apply to Special Constables appointed before 1st September, there is no power to make any further appointments except as provided in the Acts of 1831 and 1882,    Chief Constables have been asked to keep their Special Constabularies in being pending the necessary legislation to place them on a permanent basis, but -unless a Bill is passed soon there will be danger of the existing organizations being seriously weakened.A draft Bill to give the necessary powers is attached,  and I ask that I may have Cabinet authority to introduce it at the very beginning of next session with a view to its becoming law at the earliest possible date.h January,  1923.
