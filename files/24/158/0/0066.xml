FOURTH SESSION;        li 0 UGENEVA.      1928.Memorandum by. the Minister of Labour.ECRET.     1.        The Fourth Session of the General Oonferenoe of .P.5(-23).      the International Labour Organisation met in Geneva from 18th October to 3rd November, 1922,     I was appointed as Senior British Government Delegate, with Sir David Shackleton (Chief Labour Adviser to His Majesty!s Government) as second Government delegate.     I took part, in the opening sittings, but the change of Government necessitated my return to this country, and my place as Senior Government Delegate was taken by Sir David Shackleton, while Mr. Wolfe (of the Ministry of Labour) acted as substitute Delegate.. The British Employers were represented by Mr. James Lithgow,... Vice-president of the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations.     The Workers&apos; Delegate was.Mr. E,L. Poulton, Secretary of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives and a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.2.        In the following report I set out briefly tho two points which require ..a Cabinet decision.     Appendix A gives a brief account of the more important, developments which led to the adoption of the two texts on which a Cabinet decision is required, and deals with other important action of the Oonferenoe/ on which, however, no Cabinet decision is necessary .
GENEVA... 19SS.PROPOSALS REQUIRING, A CABINET DECISION .A.    NEW ARTICLE 593 OP THE TREATY OP VERSAILLES.The Conference adopted a new text of Article 393 of the Treaty of Versailles concerning the constitution of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office.     The text of the present Article 393 and the proposed new Article are given in parallel columns in Appendix &quot;B&quot;, the new words being underlined.    The following are the main particulars in which the new text differs from the present text :-(a) The old governing Body consisted of 12 Government,6 Employers&apos; and 6 Workers&apos; representatives. It is now proposed to increase the membership to . sixteen Government, 8 Employers&apos; and 8 Workers&apos; representatives.(b) Words are inserted to provide that 6 of the 18Government, 2^Employers&apos; and 2 Workers&apos; representa-Ives shall be non-European. Under article 422 of the Treaty of Versailles, amendments to Part XIII of the Treaty which are adopted by the General Conference by a two-thirds majority take effect when ratified by the States whose representatives compose the Council of the League of Nations and by three-fourths of the Members.     The new text was adopted by the Conference on 2nd November, 1922, by 82 votes to 2, with 6 abstentions.     The Swiss and Swedish Employers&apos; Delegates formed the minority, while the Italian Government Delegates and the whole Japanese Delegation abstained. All four British Delegates voted for the Article, the Government Delegates on &quot;Cabinet instructions.I auggest jaccordingly that the Government should decide
to^ratify the new Article awd that, (auhjhgct to the views of the Foreign Sepratary as to the desirability qf the pqmrounlqa-tiop being made to Parliament, before aotual ratification of the amendment takea place), I be authorised to announce this deoielon in the House of Commons.....in due oourse. &quot;The toxt of the Rooommendation with regard to the oommuni-demobilisation to the International Labour Office of Btatistioal and other information conoorning migration is given in Appendix &quot;C&quot;. The main provisions are &amp;b follows :-Article 1; Members of the Organisation should communicate to the International Labour Office all available information with regard to measures taken or contemplated.Article Si     MemborB should endeavour to communicate the total figures for emigrants and Immigrants!, showing separately nationals and aliens and specifying (particularly for nationals and, as far aa possible, for aliens) eex, age, occupationj nationality, country of last residence- and country of proposed residence.Article 5;     Members should, if possible, conclude agreements with other Members providing for the adoption of a uniform definition of the term hemigrant&quot;; the determination of uniform particulars to bo entered Upon Identity papers; and the use of a uniform method of recording statistical Information.In accordance with the instructions, tho British represent-aentative on the Committee pressed for the total omieeion of the third Article or for ite adoption, alternatively, as a separate recommendation.     It was not possible to carry either of these proposals, and a declaration was accordingly made in Ooomlttee, and repeated in full Conference, indicating that
while the British Government had no wish to prevent other Members of the Organisation from making agreements of the type which tho paragraph had in view, and would accordingly vote for the Recommendation as a whole, they must make a reservation in regard to concluding agreements as to certain matters dealt with in this paragraph, e.g., the questions of adopting uniform, identity papers, or common methods for recording statistical information.     Under present conditions, and in view of the economies which were being effected in the Public Service, they could give no undertaking to participate in such agreements.Articles 1 and 2 as finally adopted could be accepted in this country without the introduction of fresh legisla-tlon and without serious administrative diffioulties, The Government Delegates, therefore, in accordance with their instructions voted for the Recommendation, which was adopted on 2nd November, 1922, by 87 votes to none, all four British Delegates voting.A Recommendation differs from a draft Convention in that a State which accepts a Recommendation is not under an obligation to carry out in detail the provisions of that Recommendation.     In the circumstances, therefore,, and having regard tc^ the declaration made during the Conference by the British Go?Qinment Delegates, I propose Jthat the Government should acoept this Recommendation with the reservation mentioned above and that I should be authorised to make a statement in the House of Commons in thio sense in due course.(Sgd.) O.A. MONTAGUE BARLOW.Ministry of Labour. 31et January, 1925.
APPENDIX A.  &apos;   /jkJOBEPORT UPQH THE DEVELOPMENTS which   LED TO TEE ADOPTION . OP THE. TEXTS DEALT frITB IN part I OP THIS REPORT AID UPON OTHER PROCEEDINGS OP THE CONFERENCE CONCERNING WHICH 10 OA BIKE? DECISION IS REQUIRED.1*.   The Hew Artiole 595 of the Treaty of Versailles: ^iestioa&apos; of Eight&apos;States of Chief Industrial Importance.The new Article as adopted by the Conference differs in certain respects from that submitted by the Governing Body for the consideration of the Conference, of which only the following point need be noted.    After examination of the question by the Standing Orders Committee of the Governing Body, and by the Governing Body itself, it had been proposed that the clause providing for the appoint-ment of eight of &apos;che sixteen members representing Governments by the State-Members of chief industrial importance, which had raised many difficulties, should be replaced by a provision giving permanent representation to prance, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States of America.2.     Before the Conference the British Government Delegates had received Cabinet authority to accept this proposal, provided that it became clear during the Conference that the change would prove acceptable to those States who found the present constitution unsatis-factory.     They were empowered to support, as an alternative, any proposal which secured a permanent nucleus in the Government representation on the Governing Body.3. When the proposal of the Governing Body came to be discussed in Committee it met with serious opposition -for the following reason.     The eight States selected by
the Washington Conference in 1921 as being the States of chief industrial importance were - Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and the United States of America.     This selection had been contested by several countries, including India, Poland, Sweden and Spain.     Questions as to which States are the eight of chief industrial importance must be decided, under Article S93, by the Council of the league of Nations.     In view of the existing dissatls-fact ion, the Council had considered the matter fully in September 1922, and had decided that, for the purposes of the 1922 election of the Governing Body, the following eight States were to be considered as being those of chief Industrial importance;- Belgium, Canada, Prance, Germany, Great Britain, India, Italy, and Japan.     By this decision, Switzerland had lost her permanent seat and a place was no longer reserved for the United States, who had bsen replaced temporarily during the past three years by Denmark.     It will be seen that the proposal now before the Conference, suggesting the substitution for the &quot;eight-States1 clause of a clause giving permanent representation to six States-to be mentioned by seise, would have had the effect of depriving Belgium, India and Canada of the semi-permanent representation which they had secured as a result of the Council&apos;s decision.     These States, while their places were secured for the next three years, would have had to take the risk of not being elected among the other ten at the next election in 1925. 4.     The opposition was led by the Indian Government representative, who moved in Committee an amendment providing that all sixteen States should be elected at the Conference, permanent representation being reserved
to none.     This amendment was lost, as was a. further proposal to maintain the existing text with regard to the eight chief States.     The British Government Delegate, being.unable on his instructions to support the proposal abolishing the right of any State to permanent representation, abstained from voting, reserving the right to raise the question again should the proposal not meet with general satisfaction 5.     The proposal of the Governing Body having been carried in Committee, a meeting of the British Empire Delegations, attended by all three groups, was called to consider the matter, and the case of Canada and India was placed before the British Government representatives. Considering that it was possible, under the Cabinet instructions,    co accept the amended proposal of the Dominion Delegates to re-Insert the provision with regard to the eight chief States, the British Government representatives decided to support this proposal when the question came before the full Conference.     At the request of the Indian Government Delegates a cablegram was sent to the Ministry of Labour explaining the position fully and setting out the policy which it was proposed to pursue.     The pursuance of this policy was authorised by return cable and when the question came before the full Conference the recommendation accepting the text of the Governing 3ody was rejected and the clause in the existing Treaty providing for the permanent representation of the eight States of chief industrial importance was re-instated,    (i.e. the old rule, as interpreted by the Council of the League, is continued).
/) ft fi&apos;i y jRecommendation Concerning the Communication to theInternational J^hOTrr^ Office,pf Statistical and other Information Concerning Migration.6.     The form in which the first two Articles (seeAppendix &apos;C) were finally adopted by the Conference isa considerable modification of the text originallysubmitted to the Conference by the International labourOffice. .   Thus,,,Article 1 now makes it clear that only such information as is available is to be communicatedto the International labour Office.     The provisionwith regard to age classifications which could not beaccepted for this country was deleted altogether, as wasa provision in the same paragraph as to the supply ofinformation with regard to &quot;family condition&apos;&quot;.     Theclause recommending the supply of particulars as tocountry of last residence and country of proposed futureresidence, was a modification of the proposal, not acceptable in this country, that particulars as tocountry of origin and destination should be furnished.In the third Article the principal amendment adopted wasthe deletion of the clause suggesting that members should have recourse to the International labour office for the preparation of the agreements referred to inthat Article.Periodicity of the Conference. 7.     The Conference also had before it a proposal to amend the first paragraph of Article 389, which, in its present form, provides for a meeting of the General Conference &quot;at least once in every year&quot;.     The proposed amendment was the substitution of the words &quot;once in every two years&quot; for &quot;once in every year&quot;.
8.    The British. Government representatives were authorised by Cabinet instructions to support this proposal, provided that power..was retained to hold a Conference in any intermediate year.     Owing, however, to the solid opposition of the Labour Group and of the South American representatives (who were all Government Delegates), the proposal was not carried, in spite of the efforts of ,the British and Dominion Government and Employers1 Delegates:,     The text of the present Treaty, the refer e, stands09.     There was, however, general agreement that it was not desirable that the Conference should proceed every year to the adoption of draft Conventions and  . He commendations and a Resolution was adopted recommending the holding of &quot;alternate sessions of preparation and decision&quot;; the first type being devoted to general discussion of drafts to be adopted by a simple majority, the final vote, requiring a two-thirds majority, being postponed until the next year&apos;s Conference, 10.   The feasibility of dividing annual Conferences in this way not being apparent, the British Government Delegates abstained from voting upon this Resolution. It will probably happen in practice that no one Conference will be able to confine its work to the adoption of draft Conventions and Recommendations or, on the other hand, to the preparation of preliminary drafts for adoption   the following year.     Bach Conference will probably have on its Agenda certain subjects which, having been considered at the preceding Conference, have now reached the stage at which a draft Convention or Recommendation may be adopted, and; on the other hand, certain other subjects which are to be brought up for preliminary examination. This arrangement, in spite of its disadvantages, will possess the merit that no draft9.Convention or/
He commend at ion will be adopted until tho question has be-on considered both by Governments and internationally during the sixteen months preceding the Conferonco at which tho final texts are adopted,Urjomp] eyment,11.     In accordance with the decision of the 1921 Conference, tho Director laid before tho 1982 Conference a Soport&apos;con-taining information as to the state of unemployment through-out the wo:rld and the stops taken by the countries con-concerned tc deal with the problem, and indicating the work dona by the International labour.Ofiioo in collecting and distributing information and in , studying the subject.     The Oommittae dealing with the question adopted a Sesolutieuj confirmodj with slight amendments, in full Conference, instructing the Office to continue its work.Washington Hours Convention, 12,    A general discussion took place in full Conference in which it became clear that many countries were finding that the inelastic terms of the Washington Convention presented obstacles to ratification,     Tho possibility of conditional ratification was mentionsls but no definite decision was raschal, and it was left tc the Director of the Office to continue his enquiries into the subject and his negotiations with countries which were experiencing diflicultioSoGorman as a Third Official Sengoegq. 13.     An unsuccessful attempt at a meeting of the Sovorning Body immediately preceding the Conference to secure tho adoption of German as an official language of the Drgaaisa-. tion was renewed at the Conference, a Eesolution to that effect being tabled by tha Swiss Workers1 Dolegato.     This Rosalutian came bofore tha Plenary Session on tho last day, together with a series of resolutions covering&apos;a wide range
of subjects,,    O^^ifSJCsrtai the groUnd,-that there -was no time to deal with so maiay^KBSOJaxtiona at one sitting;, a proposal was made by the Belgian Tiw&amp;lJ3&amp;xma*- Delegate that the whole of these resolutions should be referred en bloc to the Governing Body, and this course was ultimately adopted,     (There is reason to believe that this move was engineered from Paris, in order to prevent discussion of the proposal to adopt German as a third official language, but no overt action was taken by tho Prench Government Delegates,.) The decision gave rise to bitter protest by the German Workers1 Delegate, after which the whole   &apos;German Delegation withdrew.14.     The movement for the adoption of German as a third official language is growing in strength and if the Organisa-tion wishes to gain the support of the great mass of German-speaking -workers, it will probably be necessary to make some further-vconoession in this respect, even if tho adoption of a third official language involves a   eon-Siderable increase in expenditure, directly in the case of publications and indirectly as a result of the additional time required for the translatian of all speeches into two other official languages..Election of the. Hew Governing Body. 15.     The period of office of the first Governing Body having expired, it was necessary for the 192H Conference to proceed to the election of the new Governing Body.     As mentioned above, the Conference adopted certain proposals for the reform of the constitution of this Body.     Pending tho ratification of those proposals, however, it was necessary to proceed tc the election of the now Governing Body under tho terms of tho existing Treaty, i.o., in addition to the eight States of ohieS industrial importance
selected &quot;by the Council two months previously; the Conference had ta elect lour other Governments to tho Governing Body,     Spain, Chili, Finland and Poland wore elected.     Each of these countries was the nominee of a grouping of States which reflect political alliances independent of the working of tho International labour Organisation, Spain and Chili together representing tho South American Countries; and thoir Motherland; Finland the Scandinavian and Baltic groups;    and Poland tho little Entente,16.     The Employers1 representatives elected to the new Governing Body aro nationals of Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Ozocho-Slovaitia and South Africa,I     Switzerland having given place to South Africa.I     17.     In the Workers1 Group no change has taken place,I     too,, the Workers1 representatives are nationals of tho following countries - Great. Britain, Canada, France,I    Netherlands, Sweden and Germany.
Standi^^pTders^pf the Governing Body.18.   It may be convenient in this memorandum to refer to certain important changes in the Standing Orders of the Governing Body, of which Sir Montague Barlow was ahle to secure the adoption.   In the first place, a change was made in the period of office of the Chairmanship of the Governing Body, and it is now provided that the Chairman shall hold office for one year and shall he eligible for re-election during the period of office of the Governing Body.   As the Standing Orders were originally drafted, the Chairman was elected for three years.19.   As some of the Cabinet ore aware from a paper which was circulated to the late Cabinet (CP3974) the British Representative had hoped to secure that, as in the case of the Council of the league, there would be-a rotation of Chairmen amongst the Government representatives on the Governing Body -a different Member taking the Chair at each Session.   The sense of the Governing Body as a whole was against so drastio a change; but he was able to secure that a new election for the Chair should be held annually.    M. Contains, the french official who has held the Chair for 3 years has now been re-elected for a fourth year; but the Governing Body may wish to retain him in the Chair,Standing Orders of the Conference^and of the Governing Body;204   It was also possible for the British Representative to secure an amendment of tha Standing Orders of the Governing Body and of the Conference providing for a reference to,and report by, the finance Committee of the Governing Body on all proposals involving expenditure.   The new Standing Orders may do something to impress upon the- Conference and the Governing Body the importance of limiting the activities of the Organlsa-tion to the financial resources at ita disposal;   the tendency
in the past having been rather in the direction of assuming that funds were available for whatever programme the Office or the Conference might desire to adopt.31. A further change in the Standing Orders of the Conference was made on Sir Montague Barlow1a initiative for tho purpose of confining the business of the Conference to subjects of which proper notice had been given, and thus avoiding unprofitable or Inconclusive discussions and docisions. It is now provided that, as a general rule, no resolution other than those relating to items on the Agenda shall be moved at any sitting of the Conference unless a copy has been deposited with the Director of the International Labour Office at least seven days before the date fixed for the opening of the Session of the Conference. Pin financial business e.22, Although the Governing Body, which met immediately before the Conference, and not the Conference itself, was ocnoerned in the matters reported below, the Cabinet may like to be informed of the action taken with regard to the decision of the Assembly of the League in September last, sanctioning an expenditure of three million Swies francs upon the erection of new premises for the International Labour Office on a site recently presented by the Swiss Government.,23; Sir Montague Barlow was not satisfied that proper consideration had been given by the Assembly to the proposals of the Director In this respect and he accordingly secured their - reference back to the Finance Committee of the Governing Body. The Finance Committee appointed a Committee, upon which the British Government was represented, and as a result of their deliberations it was decided that architects should be invited to compete; and contractors to tender, for the new building on the basis of an expenditure of two and a half million francs
and not three million franca as had been originally contemplated, and that the basic requirements of space should also be reduced.   The Committee subsequently modified the general programme of construction with a view to reducing expenditure on extravagant and unnecessary accommodation and will, it is hoped, continue to exercise a strict control over tho expenditure incurred as the work proceeds.
