In this connection the Committee have examined certain further provisions submitted to them by the President of the Board of Education.The Committee recommend as follows&apos;:-&apos;(a) That in view,of the fact that the Education Aot 19?1 is not in operation, sub-^section III of Clause 1 is the only part of that. Clause which it, is necessary to retain.(b) That the provisions of Clause 3 respecting the power of Local education Authorities to give directions as to the remuneration of teachers in non provided schools should be retained and should be extended to apply to the ago of retirement and leave of absence of non provided school teachers.,,(c) That it is.undesirable.to extend, further the scope of Clause 3 so as to-empower local Education Authorities to give directions respecting the dismissal.of married women teachers In non provided schools..(d) That as in the opinion of the Board of Education Parliamentary control over educational expenditure can probably be secured by administrative action, and as Clause 4 is -likely to provoke undue., controversy; Clause 4 should be abandoned; this decision is based on the understanding that the Board of. Education will, if necessary, exercise their powers of. rationing and will obtain legisla-tive sanction, for so doingif their right td do so is challenged.-IMMMIIIilBIl
