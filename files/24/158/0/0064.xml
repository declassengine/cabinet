(Lausanne).January 31st, 1923.D.     6.10.p,m. January 31st, 1923.R.     7,&apos;lO.p.m. January 31st. 1923.No.   252.     (?0.-----oOo.....MOST URGENT.I commenced meeting this morning by speech of some length introducing treaty, explaining its general character and object and Indicating immense concessions which have been made to the Turks in respect of subjects dealt with in my commission. Text has been telegraphed to British press. Garrcni followed by expounding quite fairly judicial provisions of treaty.   Bompard then ex-plained financial concessions and drew an impas-sioned picture of Turkey&apos;s perfidy in entering the war and her treachery to France.   All three speeches concluded with appeal to Ismet to accept treaty and were based on assumption that treaty Is our last word,   I then resumed the chair in order to hear speeches of remaining delegations.   American delegate joined in general appeal in a somewhat ln-yolved and nebulous oration ending with declaration that refusal of Turkey to sign would be an lrrepar-able disaster to herself,,.Japanese, Roumanian, and Serbian delegates then spoke shortly in similar sense.   Ismet Pashareplied.......,.
replied with a brief declaration taking note of what had been said, complaining of novelty of certain demands made in treaty, and concluding with request for. eight days delay before giving official reply of Turkish delegation, this period to he consumed in private negotiations, at end of which commissions were to re-assemble to hear re-results or. as is more probable to resume their labours.   Cabinet will observe that this was precisely the demand forshadowed in my telegram No. 251 of yesterday.   I then adjourned conference for ten minutes to admit of my delivering reply on behalf of the Allies.

Bompard and Garroni, in the spirit of their private conversations of yesterday, re-pudiated previous agreement with me declaring that Ismet&apos;e request was entirely reasonable and could not be refused without discourtesy announced their intention to stay on here and conduct proposed &apos;con-versations and said that if I refused that I should be responsible for breaking up conference and wreck-ins treaty.   I declined to recede from my main position pointing out complete tergiversation of my colleagues in which I declined to participate and which I threatened to expose, insisting that Ismet1s terms meant re-opening whole case which we had un-animously declared to be closed, and if suggested conversations were to fail, revival of conference a week hence.      I refused either to agree to this or to leave any member of British delegation (?gr, omit.) me or to allow any resumption of publicdebates........
debates.    Utmost that I would concede, and that with a reluctance that I cannot exaggerate, was to post-pone my departure until Saturday, or at the latest Sunday night, in order that Ismet, who had already had treaty in his possession for three days and knows every article in it by heart might have his stipulated week for consideration and private discussion before giving his final reply,,    I stated my intention to make this announcement to conference forthwith on my own responsibility whether my colleagues agreed or not and from it I declared my inability to recede.Upon our return to conference chamber I accordingly announced that I would out of compliment to Ismet Pasha and Turks consent to postpone my departure until Sunday night at latest and that I was at his disposal in the interim.    Ismet replied that he would-do his best to accommodate me.Part III followso

It is to my mind clear that Turks do not mean fighting and must have a treaty, and that enemies whom I have to contend with and defeat are not at Angora but at Paris and Home.   I am reporting in another telegram aboutpresident ......
president of the Council&apos;s attitude hut in the mean-time I ask for four days additional law which will result, it is true, either in a treaty or in rupture out more probably former, while if there is rupture it will be in a wider field than the Near East. Cabinet have doubtless observed rising tide in French press against Poincare&apos;6 pusillanimity in which he finds a faithful adherent in M. Bomparcu (Ends),
