COMMITTEE.Note by the Minister of Health.Lord Onalow&apos;3 Committee have not yet quite completed their labours so I circulate for the information of my colleagues a summary of their recommendationa approved by the majority.A.G.B.January 23rd 1923.
RENT RESTRICTION ACT COMMITTEE.Summary of Principal Recommendations of ^Majority.1, That all restrictions should be removed at the earliestpossible date, but that it is not practicable to remove all the restrictions on all classes of houses at &quot;Once.2. That the further period of restriction which ia re-ooranended should be regarded as in the nature of a transi-tion period between the present time of full control, and the time when all restrictions are removed, and that accord-ingly the new Act should aim at the gradual withdrawal of control during the transition period.3, That in the case of England and Wales houses whichwere first brought within the scope of restrictions by the 1920 Act should not be -included in any new Act;    that houses first brought in under the 1919 Act should be pro-tec ted until Michaelmas, 1924; and that protection should be withdrawn from the remaining class of houses at Michaelmas, 1925.   These dates were accepted by the Committee as those to which all members might agree, although in the first instance some members inclined to later dotes, while others favoured earlier dates.   The dates will require alteration as applied to Scotland, regard being paid to the different laws regulatiqn^tenancies in that country.   The relatively higher cost of building in Scotland may have, a bearing on the fixing of the dates for that country.4. That the increases of rent permissible under thepresent Act should not be altered except in the case of a tenant who sublets part of a house.    The position of Scottish house-owners, who are placed at a disadvantage as compared with English owners in consequence of the Scottish rating system, to receive consideration.^ 11O &apos;J is
5. That when any house to which the Act applies is,or becomes wholly vacant after 1st February, 1923,. it shall be withdrawn from the scope of the Act.6. That at any time during the period of operationof the new Act, the tenant of a house to which the Act applies shall have an exerciseable option of contracting out of the Act by entering into an agreement with his landlord, enforceable by both parties, for a lease of the house, the term of such lease, which may begin to ran from any date to which the parties may agree, to extend beyond the date at which the new Act ceases to apply to the house, on any terms as to rent, etc. which may be agreed upon;   provided that in the case of a house which will be protected until 1925, such lease shall not be valid unless and. until the landlord has obtained the approval of the court;7. That analogous provisions to those In the present act relating to the land lord&apos;s right to possession in certain cases shall be re-enacted, but with the following modifications:-(a) alternative accoranodation to be defined as &quot;accommo-dation reasonably suitable to the residential and other needs of the tenant and his family&quot;;(b) an owner requiring possession of his house for his 07/n or his wife.!3 occupation, or the occupationof one of his children shall if he became the owner before lat February, 1923, be entitled to obtain possession without any condition as to alternative accommodation, provided that he has given his tenant at least three months1 notice to quit, such notice not to expire before Michaelmas, 1923, and provided also that in the case of a person who did not become the owner until after 31st
December, 1921, the court consider that greater hardship would be oaused by refusing the order for possession than by granting it; (o)   in the case of a house, possession of which isrequired for an employee, whether agricultural or otherwise, the present provisions should be amended so as to apply not only to the case of a man already employed, but also to the case of a man about to be employed;(d) the present provisions whereby possession can beobtained by public authorities and statutory companies to be extended to the case of a private person or company oarrylng out improvement works, in oases where the court considers that the carrying out cf such works is in the public interest;(e) the present provision whereby a landlord can obtainpossession if a person residing with the tenant is a nuisanoe or destructive, to be extended to include the oase of a destructive sub-tenant or lodger;(f) in the oase of licensed premises the licensee not to be protected from eviction when the owner has obtained an order from the licensing justices for a transfer of the licence, or even, possibly, when the usual temporary authority pending the next licensing session has been obtained.In all the cases dealt with in paragraph (b) to (f) an order for possession must be obtained from the court, and such order shall not be given unless the court is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so.That so long as a particular house remains protected aa regards rent, any mortgage on that house should he restricted as under the present Act, both as regards
rate of mortgage interest and as regards the power of calling in the mortgage.    (Lord Onalow, Sir Aubrey Symonds and Sir Ernest Hiley dissented from this recommendation, being in favour of the removal of all restrictions in respect of mortgages).The position as to sub-tenanta In houses to whioh the new Act applies shall remain substantially unaltered. So long as the tenant is protected against excessive charges by the landlord, the sub-tenant should be equally protected against excessive charges by the tenant, but at the same time tenants should be allowed to oharge some strictly limited addition to the permissible rent of the part of the house oocupied by the Bub-tenant, and the landlord should be allowed tc oharge the tenant some strictly limited addition to the permitted rent in order to reooup him for the additional expense entailed by extra wear and tear, or by structural alterations necessitated by the oooupation of the house by more than one family.   In order to check the present practice of excessive ohargea to sub-tenants, we think the landlord as well as the aub-tenant should be given the right to apply to the court for determination of the permissible oharges, also where a tenant gives his landlord notice to quit, the position of the sub-tenant shall not be affeoted.   This is to meet the position created by a legal deoision that in suoh oases the subtenant haB no rights.That the exiBting&apos;provioion whereby a tenant can apply to the court for a suspension of the increase of rent allowed, on the ground that the premises are not in a reasonable state of repair, should be inoluded in the new Aot.That the provisions as to furnished lettlngs, or lettings with attendance should be reenacted, but that
some prevision should be inserted to prevent a landlord escaping the restrloUono of the Act by putting in a pieoe of linoleum or carpet, or some trumpery pieoe of furniture, or arranging for some slight attendance.That the provisions ae to &quot;key-money&quot; and &quot;premiums&quot; should be reenacted (with modifications to cover the case of a leaae under recommendation No.6) and that where a condition io imposed of taking furniture at an extravagantly excessive price, the excess over a reasonable prioe should be treated as a premium.That the provision in Section 12(9) of the present Aot relating to the assessment of new houses should not be re-enacted.That the position created by the House of Lords&apos; deolsion in Nicholson v. Jaokson should be altered.   The decision is that in the case of compounded property the landlord is only entitled to claim from the tenant the aotual increase of rates paid by himself tc the rate oolleotor and not the aotual increase   in the rates assessed   I on the premises.     The benefit of the compounding allowance should be restored to the owner.That the provisions in the present Aot restricting the levying of distress for recovery of rent should be re-enacted.That not ices of increase of rent should be simplified so that a landlord need only inform the tenant of the amount of the increase he claims, although the landlord shall be bound to supply the tenant with particulars as to standard rent, etc., if the tenant demands them.   Any increase whioh is in excess of the legal increase shall be invalid only in respect of the excess.
Attention io oalled tc the serious hardships on landlords owing to the fact that under the present Act they may be oalled upon to repay excess sums extending baok to 1920.    Under the earlier Acts only six months&apos; excess -payments could be reolaimed.     If, however, the preceding recommendation is aooepted, this point will lose much of its importance, since a bona fide mistake on the part of the landlord will only invalidate a notioe for increased rent in bo far as the increase of rent claimed exceeds the permitted increase.   . Therefore no specific proposal to limit the tenant&apos;s right to refund of increases in exoeBs of the permitted increases, is put forward.
