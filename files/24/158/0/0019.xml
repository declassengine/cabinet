(IjHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.secbet.   ,   ,67PTI9. (m;OABIIIET.BOARD OF TRADE BILLS.IJcte by the President of the Board of Trade.mIn the course of the last Parliament the Board-of Trade undertook to introduce a large number of Bills,   I have been carefully through all these measures, which vary in merit and urgency, and I submit the following programme for the general approval of the CabinetoI have divided the Bills into (A) Bills which I think it is essential to pass in the coming Session.  (B) Bills which should he introduced but which, it is not absolutely necessary to proceed with:  (c) Bills which would be acceptable if introduced as Private Members1 Bills: (D) Bills which I propose to drop altogether.(A).   The Bills which I regard it a3 essential to pass are the following:-(l) The War Charges (Validity) Bill.As the Cabinet are aware this Bill is necessary in order to validate the action of the Crown in the past in making charges aggregating to some  15 millions.(2) The Cotton Levy Bill.This Bill is necessary to maintain the Ootton Levy for the finance of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation.   The Cabinet has already approved the undertaking, which I have given that this   Bill shall be introduced as a Private Members&apos; Bill and be given Government facilities.   It is non-contentious and will, I think, go through with practically no discussion.(3) The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill.This is a Bill to give effeot to the Hague Rules.   The strongest possible pressure is being ibrought to bear by all the business interests     \ concerned:-   Shipowners, Merchants, Bankers, Underwriters - urging that the promise of my predecessor should be implemented: and this pressure is greatly strengthened by the fact that the International Maritime Conference has endorsed the Rules since this pledge was given.
(4) The Deck Cargoes of Timber Bill.This is a one-olause Bill to remedy a defect in the law which is a source of serious danger at the present time.(B).   The Bills which I think we ought to introduce but which I do not regard it as of vital importance to carry in the coming Session are the following:-(1) The Merchandise Marks Bill.This Bill has been promised, ever since the Committee reported in 1920.   It passed through the House of Lords and obtained a second reading in the House of Commons in the laBt Session of the last Parliament.(2) A Merchant Shipping Bill to give statutory force to certain proposals contained in the Genoa and Geneva Conventions, which are strongly desired by the merchant seamen, and in which, I believe, the shipowners would acquiesce.(3) The Sale of Bread Bill., to which the late Government were pledged and the provisions of which were continued under the Expiring Laws Act, 1922.(.0).   The Bills which I suggest might be introduced as private Members&apos; Bills, but for which Government time wouldnot be promised ares-(l) Moneylenders1 Bill.(2) Clinical Thermometers Bill.(D).   The Bills which I propose to drop altogether, andwhich I should be averse to reconsidering unless there is strong pressure, are:-(l) Banks (Audit and Amalgamation Control) Bill.(2) Trade Monopolies Bill.(3) Measuring Instruments Bill.The attached Memorandum gives particulars of the Billsreferred to above.(Intld.) P.LL.G.Board of Trade,16th January, 1923.
BOARD OF TRADE BILLS. OLASS (A).Bills which it is thought essential to pass during thocoming Session...(1) WAR CHARGES (VALIDITY) BILL.Details with regard to this Bill will be found in a Memorandum (CP. 4304) olroulated to the Cabinet last November.     Briefly, it is a measure for making valid certain charges and levies imposed by the Government during the late war.     If the Grown&apos;s action is not validated by a special statute, olaim3 for repayment may be made which may aggregate  15,000,000 and possibly more.     The&apos;Bill should be proceeded with as soon as possible.(2) EMPIRE COTTON-GROWING BILL.The Cabinet considered a Memorandum on this Bill (CP. 4336) on the 19th Deoember last, and decided that Government support and full facilities should be given during the forthcoming Session for a private member&apos;s Bill for the purpose.     (Cabinet Conclusions 71 (22) Min. 8.).(3) CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA.The Imperial Shipping Committee recommended in 1921 that there should be uniform legislation in the various parts of the Empire on the lines of the Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1910, and this reoommendation was adopted by the Imperial Conference of 1921.    Owing to various causes effect has not yet been given to this decision.Shortly after the Imperial Conference of 1921, an unofficial International Conference held under the auspices of the International Law Association drew up a code of rules on the subject, known as the Hague Rules.     The business interests ooncerned - shipowners, merchants, bankers, and underwriters - are agreed that any legislation 3hould take the form of giving statutory foroe to a oode baeed on the Hague Rules with certain amendments designed to bring them into closer conformity with the recommendations of the Imperial Shipping Committee.     The late Lord Chancellor and some other eminent lawyers saw objeotion to legislation in this form, and a Bill which had been prepared in August was therefore not introduoed.     Since then, the International Maritime Conference which met at Brussels has assented to a draft Convention which embodies the Hague Rules with these and certain other amendments.In reply to a question in the present Parliament, on 27th November, it was stated that the matter would receive careful consideration;   that it was not yet possible to make any definite statement as to the introduction of legislation? but that it was hoped to take the matter up very shortly.The business interests are pressing strongly for legislation
4 q, and we. are under obligation to proceed with a Bill.(4) DECK CARGOES OF TIMBER.A serious flaw was recently discovered in the law relating to tho carriage of deck loads of timber in winter time, namely that if the total penalty to whioh tho ship is liable exceeds  100, a summary prosecution cannot be taken.     The position, therefore, is that until the law is amended, the Board of Trade oannot proseoute summarily the worst offenders, who, in fact, are foreigners, and this means that it is in praotice extremely difficult in these oases to enforce the important safety regulations as to timber deok cargoes.     A one-clause Bill should be sufficient to remedy the defect and it ought not to be contentious.    Authority is sought to proceed with such a Bill during next Session.CLASS (B).Bills which should be introduced, but which it is not absolutely necessary to proceed with.(1) MERCHANDISE MARKS BILL.The object, of this Bill is explained in memoranda sub-mitted to the Cabinet by Sir Robert Home on the 27&apos;th January 1921,  (CP. 2491) and by Mr. Baldwin on 19th November, 1921, (CP. 3491).     It followed the recommendations of a Departmental Committee set up by Sir Auckland Geddes, when President of the Board.The Bill was introduced into and passed the Lords during last Session, and received its seoond reading in the House of Commons on the 5th July, but had not entered upon its committee stage before the Recess.     Certain details of the Bill are at present receiving further consideration in tho Department.There is a considerable demand from the commercial community for legislation on the subjeotj   a Parliamentary Question was asked last Session as to when the Bill would be re-introduced, and the reply was, not during that Session. Sir Eric Geddes, who is now President of the Federation of British Industries, was also inquiring some time ago whether the Government intended to push on with the Bill;   he was informed verbally that the Board were not aware of any proposal to drop it.There appears to be a strong oase for proceeding with legislation on this subject, and it is hoped to have a fresh draft ready, to submit to the Cabinet, before the beginning of next Session.(2) MERCHANT SHIPPING (GENOA AMD GENEVA CONVENTIONS.).Three Conventions were adopted at the International Labour Conferences at Genoa in 1920 and Geneva in 1921, whioh have a bearing on the mercantile marine.     They were all signed by the British Delegates, who consisted of
1 91two Government representatives, one representative of employers, and one of employees.   If they are accepted by the British Government they will involve legislation to provide (l) that where a ship has been lost, members of the crew shall be entitled to wages during consequent unemployment up to a maximum of two months; (2) that persons under 18 years of age should be medically inspect-ed both on first engagement in the mercantile marine and thereafter once a year; and (3) that persons under 18 years of age should not be employed as firemen and trimmers. The President of the Board of Trade has received a letter from the Minister of Labour saying that a deputation from the national Sailors1 and Firemen&apos;s Union pressed upon him their desire that these Conventions should now be-brought into effect as soon as possible.   Sir Montague Barlow points out that, aB regards the Unemployment Indemnity Convention, the action of the British representatives, of which he was the senior, in voting in favour of the draft, was subsequently endorsed by the Government (CP,3373, and Cabinet Decision 82 (21)), and that so long ago as tho 8th November, 1921, Dr. Macnamara, on behalf of the then Government, undertook that legislation should be intro-duced to give effect to this Convention &quot;when the pressure of Parliamentary business permits&quot; (Hansard, November 8th, 1921, column 349).   He also points out that the two other Conventions have also been before the Cabinet since 21st July last (C.P.4117) without any Department raising an objection to their ultimate ratification; and he accordingly suggests that the three Conven-tions should now be ratified and a Bill introduced to give effect to them.The matter has been Informally discussed with the General Manager of the Shipping Federation, and he is of opinion that shipowners would not press any objection they might have in principle to the Unemployment Indemnity Convention; whilst they were indifferent towards the other two and would raise no opposition to effect being given to them.   All three Conventions are small matters, and it would be an advantage if the required Bill could be introduced in the course of next Session.(3)    SALE OF BREAD BILL.This Bill, which formed the subject of memoranda submitted to the Cabinet by Mr. Baldwin, when President of the Board, (C.P. 3911 and C.P.3957), seeks to make permanent the provisions of the Sale of Food Order as to the sale of Broad by even weight, which are at present continued in force under the Expiring Laws Act, 1922 till 31st December, 1923.In a letter dated 14th December, 1921, to Mr. Clynes, the late Prime Minister stated that the Government were considering the advisability of introducing a Bill to amend the Bread Acts of 1822 and 1836, so as to bring them into conformity with modern require-ment s.A Bill on these lines was introduced in the House of Commons on 28th June last, but was dropped owing to certain controversial provisions relating to Scotland only.&apos;&apos;*Finally, in reply to a Question in the House of Commons on the 6th December, 1922, an answer was given on behalf of the Board of Trade that early consideration would be given to the question of introducing a Bill on the lines of that introduced last Session. * NOTE.- See Hansard 25th July, 1922, Cols.231,245,246,254-57
A good case appears to have heen made out for this Bill, provided that the contentious Scottish clauses are dropped, and that the measure is confined to England and Wales.   The Board are advised that Sootland would still have a large measure of protection in regard to the weight of bread under the Burgh Police Acts.     The provisions which the proposed Bill would then perpetuate have worked well for the past five years, the Bill would be generally acceptable, and no serious opposition to it ie anticipated.GLASS (0).Bills which would be acceptable if introduced as private members1 Bills.(l)    EMPIRE COTTON-GROWING BILL.    (SEE A (2) ABOVE).(2) MONEYLENDERS BILL.The object of this measure is, to compel moneylenders to state on the face of a document to be signed by the borrower the rate of interest charged.Consideration of this matter was promised by Sir William Mitchell-Thomson in reply to a question in Parliament on 27th June, 1921 (Hansard, Vol. 143, Column 1835), and again on 31st October of that year.On the 29th March, 1922, a Bill for this purpose was introduced by Colonel Assheton-Pownall, supported by members of the Coalition, Liberal end Labour parties.   In view of the fact, however, that the Board of Trade themselves had a draft Bill under consideration, it was suggested to Colonel Assheton-Pownall that he might withdraw his Bill, and this ho did, but only on the understanding that Government legislation would be proceeded with.The preparation of the Board of Trade Bill has reached an advanced stage? but it is now proposed that, with a view to lightening as much as. possible the Government&apos;s legislative programme, the Bill in question should not be proceeded with, and that Colonel Assheton-Pownall should be informed that, a3 far as the Government are concerned, he is free to introduce a private member:s Bill, if he wishes.(3) CLINICAL THERJ..0!.E1SRS BILL.This Bill was dealt with in a memorandum addressed to the Cabinet by Mr. Baldwin on the llth June, 1921, (CP.3038). Its object was to render compulsory the testing of all clinical thermometers for sale in this country, on the lines of an&quot;Order of the Ministry of Munitions, now lapsed, which was in operation during the war.A Bill for this purpose was introduced into, and passed, the Lords during last Session, and received its first reading in-ts-
(1) BAiJl-S  (AUDIT AND AMALGAMATION CONTROL) BILL.This Bill was primarily founded on&quot;the report of an unofficial Committee of Bankers, dated February 1913, which recommended a system of registration of all banks operating in the United Kingdom, with a compulsory publication of monthly statements and balance sheets - mainly with the object of strengthening the position of the Clearing Banks.   A bil] was drafted in the Board of Trade dealing with (l) the audit of bank accounts, (2) returns and balance sheets, and (3) the use of the name &quot;bank&quot;.   Discussions have taken place from time to time with the bankers, but no general agreement has been reached.After the failure of Farrow&apos;s Bank, a private member introduced a Bill on the 13th April, 1921, to provide for an official audit of banks&apos; accounts; this was afterwards with-drawn, and the Treasury representative said that the Government honed to introduce legislation (Hansard 1921, Vol. 140, Columns 1211, 1213 and 1227).Some questions have since been asked in Parliament as to when the Bill would be introduced; the answers were to the effect that no date could be given; and last December the Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that he understood that tho President of the Board of Trade had the matter under considera-tion (Hansard 1922, 5th December, Column 1575).Though the failure of MacGrigor&apos;s may possibly strengthen the demand for legislation, the &amp;oard would propose that the Bill should not be proceeded with.(2) TRADE MONOPOLIES BILL.A Memorandum on this measure, which was designed to enable the State to exercise some control over the operations of trade monopolies and combinations, was submitted to the Cabinet by thethe House of Commons on the 7th March, but could, not be further proceeded with before the Recess.   British manufacturers are at present voluntarily submitting their clinical thermometers to the National Physical Laboratory test, in the hope that this course will be made obligatory by legislation not only on themselves, but also on the importers of foreign thermometers, which can now come in entirely untested.   From a health point of view the measure would be useful, and it was with the concurrence of the Ministry of Health that the Bill was brought forward by the Board of Trade as the department by which the war-time Order was latterly administered. Legislation on the lines in question is in force in France, Germany and Japan: nevertheless, in present circumstances, the Board do not suggest that the Bill should be taken up again by the Government.   It is proposed, however, to take an opportunity of suggesting to the manufacturers that they might themselves, if they wish, arrange for the promotion of a private member^ Bill on the subject.CLASS  (D).Bills which, it is suggested, should be dropped.
- 1A ftthen President of the Board of Trade (Sir Robert Home) on the 14th April, 1920 (CP.1074).During the Debate on the Second Reading of the Profiteering Act Amendment Bill on the 29th April, 1920,  (Hansard Vol. 128, Cols: 1537 - 8) Sir R. Home said that the Government were consider ingthe legislation which vould be required in order to guard against the abuse of monopoly powers.   Further, during a debate on Supply on the 9th March, 1921,  (Hansard Vol.139 column 603), a statement was made to the effect that it was the Governments intention to pass legislation to deal with trusts, though not during the then current Session.   Since that date numerous ques-tions on the subjeot have been asked, and continue to be asked from time to time, in Parliament, mainly by Labour and Independent Liberal members, though also by certain Unionist members.   The answers have been generally on the lines that the matter is under consideration, but that no undertaking can be given as to the introduction of legislation, (Hansard, 2nd June, 1921, Col.1228; 15th February 1922, Ool. 1049/ 20th July, 1922, Col. 2267; 4th December 1922, Ool. 1169; 11th December, 1922, Col. 2352).The Board would not by any means advocate the introduction of a Trusts - Bill at the present time, particularly as it would prove to be a highly controversial measure.(3) MEASURING INSTRUMENTS BILL.This Bill forms the subject of a Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet by Mr. Baldwin on the 7th June, 1922 (C,P.4018). Its object was to remedy a defect in the existing law under which Measuring Instruments are free from any effective control; the particular types of instrument which the Bill primarily had in view were petrol pumps for delivering petrol direct to the tanks of motor-cars from underground reservoirs, and certain measuring instruments used in factories for ascertaining wages.   As regards petrol pumps, the measure was designed to. meet a demand raised by a number of local authorities, as well as complaints of short measure by private individuals and in the technical press. Enquiries have shown, however, that there is no special anxiety for it among such bodies as the Automobile Association.   As regards measuring instruments in factories, a proposal to bring such instruments under control was concurred in by the Home Office.The Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on the 17th July, 1922, but was not further proceeded with before the Recess. The Board&apos;s proposal is that it should be dropped.
