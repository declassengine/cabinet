Tfl DOGUMKflT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BKITAMMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. &quot;CABINET.&apos;i7(25)COPY NOO f&quot; o&amp; U 0Interim Report of the Rating Reform Committee.1.     In accordance with our terms of reference we have considered the Memoranda (CP. 4329, CP. 4338, and CP. 4342) which have been submitted to the Cabinet on the general question of Valuation and Rating Reform and the particular-question of Agricultural Rating, and we have come to the conclusion that a Bill should be introduced for the purpose of giving effect to the scheme of reform prepared by the Ministry of Health and recommended to the late Government by a Cabinet Committee in a  -Report dated December, 1921, (CP. 3544).     A first draft of a Bill drawn generally on the lines of that scheme is appended.2.     The essential object of the Bill is to effect a reform of the machinery of valuation and rating;     it does not purport to alter the main principles of valuation, except in so far as is necessary to secure uniformity in the system, nor is it designed to deal with general questions of Local Taxation or the financial relations between Local Authorities and the Exchequer.     We do not think it would be practicable to attempt to deal with these larger issues and to secure the reform of the machinery of valuation and rating in the same kill or in the same Session of Parliament.3.     Vie think, however, that measures for securing a reduction in the burden of rateB now falling upon agricultural land might properly be incorporated in the Bill.Occupiers of agricultural land, in proportion to their income, pay a much greater share of local rates than any other ratepayers, since they are obliged to occupy so much rateable property in order to earn their living.     It is true that the farmer at present only pays half the
poundage under the provisions of the Agricultural Rates Act, 3.698, but rates have gone up enormously since then and his present burden is intolerable, especially as the deficiency in the quota for the parish has to be made up by an increased poundage.     The Act of 1996 was based on the report of the Royal Commission on Agricultural depression which recommended that land should only pay a quarter of the usual poundage and that the immediate loss of rates resulting -from the remission should be made good by the Exchequer.4,     The average relief at present enjoyed by occupiers of agricultural land (under the Agricultural Rates Act, 1996, and other statutory provisions) is in Rural Districts a little over 50 per cent of the -rateable value, and in Urban Areas approximately 60 per cent.     For the whole country the average is about 52g per cent, so that in effect agricultural lard is assessed at present at 47^- per cent, of its rateable value on the average..Our proposal is that t&amp;sssmis^^^^^^m^&amp;&apos; occupiers of agricultural land should in future be assessed cn a uniform proportion of 25 per cent, of gross annual value, (which is of course somewhat larger than rateable value).It is not proposed that the additional relief to agriculture should be specifically referred to in the body of the Bill but that it should be included in a Schedule to the Bill, among a series of equated reliefs proposed to be given to various classes of property representing: the uniform abatement to be allowed in each case from gross annual value. The relief would operate in each rating area as from the date on which the new valuation list for that area corces into force.     On the last point there was some   division of opinion as to whether the proposed relief to agriculture should or
should not become,effective immediately on the passage of  &apos; the Bill.5.       It cannot be expected that any Bill on the subject of Valuation and Rating would be uncontroversial.     It is, however; generally admitted that reform is long overdue, and we are satisfied that the uniformity of valuation which is an essential preliminary to any general reform of local taxation cannot be secured without a drastic alteration of the present system.6.       The County Councils have been pressing for reform, and it may be expected that they -*?ould support the Bill.     The Municipal&apos;Corporations would unquestionably support that part of the Bill which would provide for the simplification of rating, and there is no reason to anticipate opposition on their part to the proposed reform of valuation.     The position of Urban and Rural District Councils who will become the Rating Authorities and form the nucleus of the new Valuation Committees will clearly be improved if the Bill becomes law.7.       There is every reason to suppose that the Bill would receive strong support from the Railway Companies, a3 the simplification involved in the proposed centralised valuation of railwajr property would enable them to effect large adminis-trative economies and avoid much expensive litigation.Indeed it is more than probable that they would actively protest against a resumption of the system of parochial valuation from which, owing to the special arrangements in force during and subsequent to the War Period, they will have been freed for nearly ten years.Moreover the recent Railway amalgamations appear to make it necessary not only to provide a Central Valuation Body for England, but also to provide a Joint Valuation Body
for dealing with the Railways which run through England and Scotland and to assimilate the valuation law of the two countries in so far as it relates to Railways.8,      On the other hand considerable opposition must be expected from the i-&apos;oor Law Authorities and the present Assessment Committees, and also from the professional valuers who may lose a considerable volume of remunerative work when the reforms become operative.9.      Much will depend on the attitude of agricultural Interests, which are looking to the Government for some relief from their rating burdens.     We consider it probable that the relief proposed by the Bill would be regarded by them as satia-factory in itself and that they may be disposed to look upon it as sufficient to counterbalance the objections which they might otherwise entertain towards the proposed reforms. Agriculturalists may apprehend with some reason that the re-forms will mean a levelling up of valuations which will tell against agricultural land and they, in common with many other interests, will probably raise strong objection to the introduction of Inland Revenue Officers into the sphere of local assessment.     We have considered whether it would be practicable to dispense with this particular part of the scheme, but we   are satisfied that, if the new valuation is to serve for taxing as well as rating purposes, it is&apos;essential that the Crown&apos;s interests should be safeguarded.     Apart from this consideration, if the co-operation of the Inland Revenue Officers is abandoned, the attainment of uniformity of valuation for rating and Exchequer grant purposes will be seriously prejudiced.10.      There is a further difficulty.     If the proposed r-e-lief to the occupiers of agricultural land Is unaccompanied
9j?9by any Exchequer subsidy, it can only be given at the expense of the non-agricultural ratepayers.     The latter class contend that, they are already prejudiced by the stereotyping of the Agricultural Rates Act Grant, and although their existing grievance nay to some extent be mitigated by the adoption of larger rating units, it must be recognised that it will be accentuated by the further relief now proposed in respect of agricultural land unless means can be devised to counterbalance the loss of rateable value involved.  - To meet this difficulty we suggest that the basis on which contributions are made to Local Authorities out of the Road Fund should be revised so as to afford a somewhat greater measure of assistance to rural areas than at present in respect of the heavy costs now falling upon them in respect of highway expenditure.     We are inclined to doubt whether the present scheme of distribution does adequate justice to these areas.The heavily burdened industrial ratepayer in urban areas is also likely to claim relief and the only consolation that can be offered to him would seem.to be an undertaking that his claims -will be recognised when the time comes for a general review of the incidence of local taxation and an adjustment of the relation between local funds and the Exchequer, towards which the scheme now proposed is an essential first step.11.      It is clear from what has been said that the chances of the Bill depend upon the nature of the arrangements which can be made with the various authorities and interests con-cerned, and a stage has now been reached at which it 1b necessary to consult representatives of those authorities and interests, and to collect a considerable amount of statistical data.     If a Bill is to be introduced and passed into law during the coming Session of Parliament, the time available for the
work remaining to be done is very short and a decision of the Cabinet&apos;is therefore urgently required.     The accompanying preliminary draft, which will servo to indicate the scope of the proposals, is submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet, and,If the Bill is to be proceeded with, their approval of the general lines on which it is drawn is desired.(Sgd.)
