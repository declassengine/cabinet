20, Egerton Terrace, S.W.3.51st January, 1923.Uy dear President,Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Bill.I very much hope the Government will make time to push this Bill through this Session.   As the Bill is founded on the Report of the Acquisition and Valuation of Land Committee, of which I was Chairman, and I have taken an active part in negotiating its terms, you will understand why I am writing to you.(l) The present is an opportunity of getting the Bill through which may never recur. Except for one or two points of detail, which I hope will shortly be settled the colliery ownerB and royalty owners ere in agreement upon its terms and as regards the second half of the Bill, which deals with the support of railways, the railway companies are also agreed.   The broad object of the first part of the Bill is to remove some of those obstacles which have interfered with the efficient development of the nation&apos;s mineral resources, through difficulties of private ownership.   I had leading coalowners and mining engineers on my committee and we went into this aspect of the matter very fully, and formulated a list of such obstacles.   Some of the worst of them will be effectually dealt with by this Bill.(2) It is impossible to give any definite estimate of the amount of mineral which the Bill will release, but J am convinced that the difficulties which it will help to remove form in the aggregate a serious interference with the economy, efficiency and volume of mineral production, and constitute therefore a real drag upon the prosperity of the industry.
(3), the  Bill involves no doubt some interference with the liberty of private ownership, but the limits of that interference are strictly defined, and even within those limits the Bill provides ample safeguards to secure that there shall be no compulsory acquisition of rights, except after enquiry by an impartial tribunal, and the constitutional responsibility of the President of the Board of Trade to Parliament is preserved.   That there is nothing in it contrary to Conservative principles I am quite clear.   That there is much in it of the highest interest to every Conservative, is also clear.   Those obstacles to production which this Bill is intended to mitigate, constitute, as my Committee pointed out in the concluding paragraph of their Interim Report, some of the chief arguments of those who urge the nationalisation of Mines,   The removal in proper oases of the main drawbacks of the existing system will not only promote the development of the-mineral resources of the country on sound lines without destroying private ownership and initiative, but also take from the Labour Party their most effective battle-cry: and make a permanent bulwark against socialistic attacks on the present system.   These views I know are Bhared by the Royalty owners in particular.(4) The position in regard to minerals adjoining railways, which is dealt with in Part II of the Bill, has been a source of grave inoonvenience ever since the Howley Park decision by the House of Lords in 1913.   Its immediate and inevitable result was to sterilise all minerals lying outside the 40 yards limit the working of which might possibly affect the railways. Everyone knows that much of this could be worked with perfect safety, but no mineowner oares to face so formidable a con-tingent liability.Since that decision, in many partioular eases individual
agreements have been made between railway companies and those interested in the coal, but my committee felt that these individual arrangements were an unnecessary expense and an unnecessary source of friction, and not always oapable of attainment,   Thoy suggested therefore to the interested parties that they should try and make a general agreement to which statutory effect could be given.   Such a provisional arrangement was reached between the colliery and railway com-panies after much negotiation, and incorporated in my committee report. Since that date prolonged negotiations have taken place the original agreement has been somewhat revised, and the Royalty Owners have come in also.   The terms, though apparently complicated, are perfectly understood by the three parties con-cerned, and will afford a permanent basis which will enable the maximum amount of coal in the neighbourhood of railways; to be worked at the least expense to those concerned, and therefore to the community.The second part of the Bill modifies the existing law on the subject in accordance with the needs shown by experience and incorporates the new agreement.(5) The parties will certainly drift apart if there is any delay in legislation. Indeed the railway companies have definitely said that certain parts of their offer are con-ditional on the early passage of the Bill.(6) In conclusion I would urge the imperative need of getting the Bill through at once. The Labour Party could only oppose on the ground that the Bill does not go far enough. I do not think they can object to its provisions as such - indeed, I have reason to think that its main points are approved, at least by certain leaders of the miners.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) Leslie Scott.
