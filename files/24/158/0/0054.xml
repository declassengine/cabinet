With reference to our earlier reports C*P,4319 paragraphs (I)(c) and (5)(I) and C.PJ4364 we have to report that we have considered further proposals submitted by the Ministry of Transport for the provision of relief works in the construction of roads at the coat of the Road Fund and have decided to recommend for the approval of the Cabinet the following worksA&quot; Scheme3 already examined and approved in pr&apos;&apos; iciple*&apos;by&quot;Th,3 Roads Department.1.

Minor works in various areas,KOTEt-   schemes (3) and (4) the Ministry would Carry out as extensions of the London Arterial road programme,The works ara to toe carried out with the help of a grant, of 60$. from the Read Fund.     The acceptance of this recommendation Involves the covering by the Treasury of any temporary deficiency in the Road Fund so caused, up to a maximum of  1,750,000.A further programme of works (including the Glasgow - Edinburgh road and amounting in all to  4.500,000) was submitted by the Ministry.     A suggestion sas made that a margin of  500,000 (with temporary Treasury liability of  250,000) should be added,  in respect of some of the works In the further programme, to the recommendation made above.     By a majority we were unable to endorse this suggestion, the Minister of labour and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry cf Transport dissenting from our conclusion(This point was raised before the Cabinet as a matter cf urgency by the Chairman on 30th January.     The recommendation of the Committee was approved,)2,     We have considered the question of a modification of the present policy in the direction of subsidising areas claiming that the burden of the relief of unemploy-ment Is intolerable^ and should be nationally borne. The present policy of permitting the cost to be spread locally over a term of years, and in special cases making Government leans, with,  if necessary, a postponement of repayment, or of payment of interest, and an ultimate possibility of some remission, appears to us to be adequate, and in view of the cost bo the Exchequer and
of the other difficulties Involved we do not recommend  ft. any change in the present policy.     we attach in Appendix A a brief note of the grounds of our decision.3.     In the above connection we have given special consideration to the position of Scotland.     The obligation to grant poor law relief has not ordinarily in that country (as it has in England and Wales) extended to the relief of the able-bodied unemployed.     The additional obligation has been imposed on the parish councils by . temporary legislation which it will be necessary to renew before May next, and that legislation, it is represented, will be strenuously opposed in the absence of provision for effective assistance and it is possible that certain parish councils may in the absence of such a provision refuse to carry out the duty imposed on them.-He were unable to accept the view that the position in the two countries could be so differentiated as to  : justify the grant of anything in the nature of a subsidy in Scotland, while England and V/alea were excluded, and as above stated we are unable to recommend any change of the general policy adopted by the Government,    The Secretary for Scotland vas unable to concur in our decision.The Secretary for Scotland proposed that, failing a direct grantt substantial relief should be made available for heavily burdened parish councils In Scotland in respect of loans, in particular by enabling those who borrow or have borrowed from private lenders to obtain subject to proper tests the same terms in regard to the postponement, and possible remission of interest and capital payments as .... are afforded to authorities borrowing from the Goschen Committee,     It was decided that the; Secretary for Scotland and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury should confer further on this question. ,4,     ue considered in the light of schemes submitted to us  . the practicability of arrangements whereby unemployment;, benefit might be used to secure or facilitate the provision of work for the recipients, rather than as a contribution towards their maintenance in idleness.The superficial attractiveness of these proposals-is very -considerable.     Much, attention has been given to them in the public press, and it is understood that the late * Minister of Health may again wish to advocate action of this kind.There appear to us to be two fatal objections to these proposals (1) The payment of a subsidy to individual employers working for profit is indefensible, particularly when the subsidised Individuals are selected from their competitors on grounds which are mainly accidental - e.g, a temporary failure of contracts - and a condition that no profit should be made by, subsidised employers, if administratively workable,   would so limit the scope of     .  . the scheme as to make it futile.     (2) Insurance against unemployment has furnished the main line of defence in . the present period of unemployment.     It is estimated that between September 1920 and December 1922  17,000,000 has been expended in poor law relief to- the unemployed.     But the Insurance scheme has provided in the same period for the maintenance of the unemployed a total sum of
 108,000,000 of which  75,000,000 has been already contributed by the employers and the insured persons. And the whole basis of the insurance schema la that benefits shall be paid during unampj.opisnt,     To divert the contributions to payment3on behalf of employed persona ,/would  be a breach of crust, and would gravely imperil the contributory basis of the scheme.It will be seen that the second of these objections arrlies with equal force to the modified scheme under which it has been proposed that subsidies, which would in effect be a relief to the local rates at the expense of the insurance funds, might be paid to local authorities and not to ordinary employers.For these reasons we are unable to recommend the acceptance of any proposals of this kind.In view of the public interest which has been taken in the matter, and of the importance of showing the nature of the misconceptions on which that interest has been based we recommend that the reasoned statement attached aa Appendix B to this Report should be communicated to the Frees.5,     Vie understand that owing to weather conditions the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries will be unable to expend the whole of the amount allotted to him for works of Land Drainage and Improvement,     At the same time the demand for assistance of this kind has proved higher than was,anticipated in Scotland, and we recommend that a sum of  10,000 be transferred from the English&quot; to the Scottish share of this grant.Signed on behalf of the Committee,A.

ItEPOhT OF COi,&apos;il,lITTEE OH UNEMPLOYMENT NECESSITOUS AhEAS.The grounds upon which the Committee on Unemployment have decided that they cannot recommend any government grant towards the local expanses of the relief of unemployment are briefly as follow:-.(l) The expenditure of substantial sums of Government money cannot be placed in the hands of local authorities without a measure of Government control.(2)   A small grant - or Indeed any grant not amounting to several millions of money - would in no way meet such demands as have been made.It is estimated that a grant of  1,000,000/ would relieve the necessitous areas by no more than an average of the equivalent of a rate of 5d, in the  .     The cost to the State of accepting the &quot;West Ham&quot; scheme would in respect of the half-year ending 30th September last have been at least  1,360,000.     This estimate is made on the basis that there would oe no grant to London Unions (where poor law expenditure is equalised through the Common Poor Fund) or to provincial Unions in which the numbers of unemployed did not reach the national average.     Only 56 Unions out of 625 would have shared in this grant.(3) Only a minority in number of Boards of Guardians are in favour of such a grant.(4)   This minority included the Boards whose administration has been on extravagant or at least on generous grounds.     It does not include the majority oi the carefully administered Unions whose inhabitants would have to contribute through the taxes to a grant.(5) Similarly a grant policy would compel the agricultural areas to contribute through taxation to the burden of the industrial areas,(6)   What ia sought is a grant for past as well as future expenditure.     This together with the varying extent to which the boards of guardians have been financed out of loans would have the effect of a violent disturbance of the course of local finance.(7)    In some areas at any rate a Government grant might have more effect in increasing the amount of local expenditure than in relieving the burden of the rate-payer.(6)   Though we would not press this point too far at the moment, there appears to be good reason for. the hope that the present period of unemployment has passed its zenith.(9)   Through grants for relief works and the Unemployment Insurance Fund an entirely unprecedented contribution is already being made to the local expenditure.(10) The present policy of sanctioning, and, if necessary, advancing, loans for current expenditure mak.s it certain that there can be no breakdown of administration for want of money.
1,     Proposals that Unemployment Benefit payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts should be used to assist the provision of work for the ur.empl.cyed have been repeated from time to time recently.     They are supported by the arguments that the present system involves a heavy expenditure without any return to the nation, and that the long continued receipt of Unemployment Benefit without work leads to the demoralisation of the unemployed;   these arguments are crystallised in the popular cry of &quot;Work not doles&quot;.2.    The proposals take two main forms:(a) that unemployment benefit should be applied In partpayment of wages on relief work provided through local authorities.(b) that such payments should be made to private employers.5.    The force of the arguments behind the proposal cannot be disputed.     The demoralisation of long Idleness is cumulative and this is particularly true of skilled men, who have rarely had experience of continued interruption of employment:   the exhaustion of Trade Union funds available for relief of unemployment among their members is affecting the discipline of many of the Unions, with the result that unofficial organisations exploit the situation.     Moreover the cost of Unemployment Benefit, whether contributed by the Employers, the Workpeople or the Treasury, is in the end obviously a charge upon industry wnich Is a deadweight so long as it secures no return in the form of increased productivity.     in themselves also, the proposals are at first sight attractive-and reasonable, and,- if practicable, would meet a popular demand as well as. minimising the bad effects of the present depression.4.    The proposals have therefore been carefully reviewed, although, in one form or other&apos;, they had previously been considered by the late Cabinet and 1&apos;ejected. as impracticable upon strong grounds.&apos; APPENDIX B.&quot;; -Statement on The use of Unemployment Benefit in aid of (A) Wages on Relief Work (B) T/ages. on Industry.
81&quot;) 9 heme&quot;;0REL^TIOH OF THIS PROPOSALS TO THE TOKMPLOYMSHI INSURANCE SC5,     In whatever form the proposals are made, there Is one nreltminary objection in principle to Which the sponsors of the Schemes have-not paid due regard.The Unemployment Insurance Fund, is contributory, and although the State directly contributes a share, three-fourths of its revenue Is derived from employers and employed.     The present rates of weekly contribution are as follows *.-Employer.     Employee.       State:. Total.Men 10 9 &amp;f 2s. lid.Women 8 7 5i Is. 8fxl.The fund has borrowed from the Treasury over  16,00 0..000 and this debt is still increasing week by week.     The debt is chargeable to the Fund and in order to pay it back it will be necessary even after Trade revives, to maintain the contribution exacted from employers and workpeople at their present high rates for a considerable period.During the past twelve months the Fund has paid out in benefit  47,700,000 of which  33,800,000 represents contributions from employers and workpeople:    of this very largo sum the contribution of the Workers alone is  15,700,000.     It is desirable to emphasise these figures, because the cry for &quot;Work not doles1&apos; is frequently based on the mistaken impression that the whole of the unemployment benefit is found by the Exchequer, like the Out-of-stork Donation paid after the Armistice.6.     Under the Insurance Acts, Benefits are mainly of two kinds:    (a) &quot;Covenanted&quot; benefit, i.e weekly benefit to which workpeople are entitled in virtue of the fact that they have standing to their credit the requisite number of weekly contributions paid during employment, (b) &quot;uncovenanted&quot; benefit, an emergency &quot;advance&quot; of benefit to persons who through the abnormal unemployment since 1920 have either exhausted their credit or have been unable to place to their credit a sufficient number of contributions to entitle them to benefit on the basis of contributions.     The payment of large sums in &quot;&quot;Cincovensnted&quot; benefit was made possible firstly by the credit of 22 millions piled up In the old limited Fund, secondly by Increasing the contributions paid by employers and employed and thirdly by drawing on the credit of the Fund as a -whole, and by borrowing from the Treasury, but the loan Which now stands at about 16 millions is a liability on the Fund which will have to be ropaid in future by maintaining a high rate of contribution.     The insurance Fund is thus a great Trust Fund maintained to provide benefit for contributors when unemployed.7.     The right to benefit, whether covenanted or uncovenanted, is not indefinite, and it is in all cases strictly conditioned t ,t1ie Posslhility of replacing the unemployed, beneficiary either in his normal employment or in suitable employment.   To provide work per se must always be secondary to replacement in normal work, and no scheme is desirable which might in any way re-ard^or endanger such replacement.     Further, the contradiction is apparent of using contributions subscribed for unemployment benefit in aid of wages for a man actually in employment.
3.     These facts make clear the nature of the preliminary objection to the proposals under consideration.     If unemployment benefit wore to be diverted from its present object in the manner suggested - and in any case this could not be done without legislation - the effect must be to strike a serious blow at the Contributory principle underlying the Insurance Scheme, if not absolutely to destroy it, and probably to endanger the repayment of the debt owing by the Fund.     Even if the use of benefit were confined to assistance to Local Authorities in respect of relief vrorks - -which have hitherto been financed directly Out of rates and taxes - this is an object quite different from that for which tho Contributions were collected and might easily lead to strong protest on the part of contributors to the Fund.9.     If the proposal is extended to include assistance to private employers, those who wish to lay the whole charge of assistence for unemployment upon the Exchequer would become insistent in their claim, and In addition employers might naturally raise an objection to the use of their own contributions in aid of other Employers with whom they have no direct coneern, and who might, in certain cases, be competitors.10.   These objections from the standpoint of the Unemployment Insurance Fund., are so veighty that they must necessarily condition the more detailed consideration of the two kinds of proposals under review.THE PK0POSAL IN RELATION TO RELIEF WORK UNDERTAKES!? BY LOCALAUTHQ-ilTIES. &apos;11.   The proposal, which has been put forward by certain localauthorities, notably the City of Birmingham, was considered by an Interdepartmental Committee which reported to the Cabinet Unemployment Committee of the late Government in 1922.   In their Second. Interim Report the Interdepartmental Committee advised against the proposal.   . Their report sent at length into the main objection, detailed above, to any raid upon the Unemployment Insurance&apos;Fund, for purposes other than those for which the Fund has been collected.   In addition they recapitulate certain inevitable restrictions and drawbacks Which seriously limit the advantages of the proposal even if it were on other grounds unobjectionable.(1) In order to avoid the danger of abuse of the Scheme it would be imperative to confine it strictly to - works Which though useful in themselves are put in hand expressly for the purpose of providing relief for the unemployed and would not otherwise be undertaken; further they must not be works which it is the statutory duty of the Authority to pay for out of the rates.(ii) The difficulty of applying the scheme to work let out on contract ./ould be so great that it would be necessary.to confine the scheme to work done by direct - labour, whereas much relief work is (with a view to stimulation of ordinary trade), being placed out to contract in the normal way.
(ill) The amount to be paid to a local authority would be the amount of benefit to which men engaged on the work would be entitled if they were unemployed.     Under the Insurance Act the payment of benefit is not extended indefinitely,   When a man came to the end of his benefit he might become liable to discharge from the relief work because he would no longer carry a premium. In any event when the relief works came to an end he would have gro,Jej-fe; exhausted his benefit and the assistance tho -Fund was meant to provide would possibly fail.him at the moment When he needed it most.(iv) Although the proposal would be, from the point of view of the Fond, less unsatisfactory if the payment could be confined only to those who are definitely a burden upon the Fund, and would be taken on to relief works as additional^ it would be difficult to resist a demand that similar payments should extend to the large number of men already engaged upon relief works.12.   The effect of the whole proposal in short would be (while possibly relieving Local Rates) to throw a great additional burden on the Insurance Fund.   Legislation 7/ould be necessary to give effect to the proposal, and the introduction of a Bill for the purpose would stimulate an attack on the contributory basis of the Insurance Fund, and rekindle the claim that the whole charge of relieving unemployment and distress should be borne by the Exchequer.    There is no analogy between Poor Law Relief which in certain cases is.being handed over to Local Authorities in respect of men employed by them on relief work, and the unemployment benefit.    Outdoor ,re lief, and the local authority&apos;a share of the cost of relief works are both found out of rates paid by practically the same group of. ratepayers, whereas the unemployment fund has been built up by contributions from employers and employed generally.   Moreover &apos;task work&apos; is a recognised concomitant of outdoor relief, and the application of outdoor relief in aid of wages on relief works is regarded as an extension of the principle of &apos;tesk work&apos;.   No one has suggested applying such a principle to a contributory scheme of unemployment benefit.If it is argued that the grants to local authorities in respect of relief schemes are insufficient, the case should be argued on that basis.    Such a plea is not in itself a justification for raiding the Insurance Fund.THE PROPOSAL IN RELATION TO   PRIVATE INDU3TRY .13.   The proposal involves a subsidy of wages for the benefit of certain employers and their workpeople.The subsidy would be paid by the Insurance Fund - that is to say - as explained above - by the contributions of employers and employed generally, and, in respect of the State contribution to the Insurance Fund, dirertly by the Exchequer.
14.     It Is obvious that such a scheme would be justified only if it resulted in a general increase of trade activity, thereby reducing the burden upon the Exchequer and rendering the maintenance of high rates of contribution to the Insurance Fund less onerous for employers and workpeople as a whole.ivhatever modifications In detail might be introduced the Sub-Co;nmittee consider the proposal quite inacceptable in principle, unless it fulfils the condition stated.15.     Two detailed schemes have been considered.   The essence of one of these was that unemployed workpeople should voluntarily surrender their benefits to an employer in return for employment at trade wages for a fixed period.     It was intended that tho benefits thus paid should enable employers to reduce their prices and &quot;so bridge the narrow gulf which separates buyers&apos; prices from sellers1 prices&quot;.     The benefit would be payable in respect of 75;  of the men taken on additional to the complement existing on the &quot;appointed day&quot;, and only men who had been unemployed for three out of the preceding six months would be eligible to carry the &quot;premium&quot;.In order to bring the scheme automatically to an end when the need for it had disappeared, it was suggested that the number of men in respect of whom employers were receiving the subsidy should be periodically reduced, by a percentage greater then the percentage reduction in total unemployment since the Inception of the scheme.16.     There appear to be t*&apos;o fatal defects in the proposal.In the first place it would be very inequitable as between firm and firm.     A firm fully employed on the appointed day woulc secure little or no benefit;    another firm which had stood off a large proportion of its workpeople would benefit considerably, although Its inability   to employ its full complement ndght be due to causes within its control such as relatively inefficient methods or management.Secondly, it is by no means clear that the specific purpose of the scheme, the reduction in prices leading to increased trade, would be achieved.     The premium is payable only in respect of a proportion of the additional men taken on. If the additional number engaged was small in proportion to the total staff, the effect on the total wages bill would not be very marked, and if the majority of the workpeople carried the premium, there is nothing in the scheme as submitted to ensure that the subsidy of wages would lead to a reduction in prices either in the firm itself,&apos; or generally in the industry, whereas if the firm did in fact use the premium to cut prices below the general level obtainable by its competitors, the competitors would object to such a use of an unemployment fund to which they had themselves contributed.17.    Another scheme submitted to the Government more clearly recognised the inherent difficulties of a subsidy of wages, and he-s attempted to suggest means by which exploitation of the subsidy might be prevented.
It is suggested, for example,.that the average numbers employed weekly before a given date should be ascertained, and that the subsidy should apply only to the numbers of men subsequently employed above, that average.     Such a condition would certainly involve heavy administrative expenses in checking.a number of difficult items in the claims.The most important condition suggested in the Scheme is that employers within the scheme should bind themselves, on the asduran.ce of thoir Auditors, to make no profit or limited profits, during any period in respect of which they draw a subsidy for their workpeople.     There is obviously some risk in taking on more workpeople than the work immediately on hand, requires, as the increased production may not be. disposable-, and if no profit is allowed, it is doubtJaA whether enough employers would be prepared to enter the scheme to make it of any practical value.Moreover apart from the limitation of profits proposed there is nothing in the scheme to prevent the subsidy from being paid in respect of labour which would have obtained employment in any event in consequence of improvement in trade.     The limitation of profits alone would hot in quite conceivable circumstances be sufficient to prevent such a result.On the other hand to allow profits to be made in private industry by certain employers with the help of a fund to which all employers and workpeople are compelled to contribute, would not be likely to be acceptable to the Industry of the country generally.IS.      There is a further objection which the scheme does not meet and to which very great importance must be attached. The experience of the Poor Law prior to 1832 suggests that a subsidy of the character proposed would, inevitably depress the general level of wages.     It is true that the existence of a large body of unemployed workpeople already has some effect in this direction but there can be no doubt that the acceptance of the principle of a subsidy of wages in this manner, would by degrees transfer any responsibility for maintaining even a subsistence level of ;,wages from employers to the Fund from which the subsidy was derived,- i.e. that the ratio between !wages1 and .1 subsidy&apos; would gradually be reversed.     An illustration of this tendency may be found in the well known scheme for subsidising agricultural wages in certain areas from the Poor Law. which was known generally as the Speenhamland Scheme, and which was discardad early in last Century.     The result of the working of that and similar schemes was that it became almost impossible for a worker not on the Poor Law to obtain employment, that the wages paid were kept at a scandalously low level, and that the burden of the Poor Rate on the ratepayers became a crushing burden which had to be relieved.&quot;IS. These objections even to a scheme so carefully thought out as. that considered, appear to be insuperable.
20.   The conclusion reached is therefore that, for inter alia, the reasons stated above, the use of the Unemployment Insurance Fund to subsidise wages, whether on relief work carried out by local authorities, or of employers in private industry, would be objectionable in principle, as gravely endangering the contributory ba.3i3 of the Fund, and impossible in practice without serious inequities and risk of abuse.   It is with some reluctance, that this conclusion has been accepted in view of. the impressive nature of the arguments on which the proposal is based. . A determined attempt to find some practicable mean&apos;&apos; of overcoming the Inherent difficulties has been made, but such means have not. yet been suggested.   The conclusion, seems therefore inveit-able that whatever system may be adopted for additional relief against the effects of unemployment, or for the stimulation of trade, the u*e of the Unemployment Insurance Fund for the purpose must be ruled out of consideration.
