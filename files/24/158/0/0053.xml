referred to (.,c;v.irJuee of Home AffairsVv- o)DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEIdttiENT.    A C) this Bill has been put into Class A, &quot;Essential Bills mainly controversial&quot;, for early introduction in the Houbo of Commons.   A point,howovor, arises which I think the Homo Affairs Committoe might bo askod to consider, and advise the Cabinot upon. &apos; In tho Bill as introduced in tho House of Commons last August there was a provision exoepting the ohargos imposed for Milk lic6noeB from the general clause which proposed to give validity to tho lovies made in rospoot of lioencos, etc, during the war.   It was for recovery of a sum in respect of these Milk charges, which had been imposed to oqualizo tho profits of doalors a3 betwoen ono producing area and another, that the Crown took proceedings against tho Wilts Unitod Dairies Company; and, after obtaining judgment in tho High Court, an advorso decision was encounter-od on tho Company taking the case to the Court of Appeal, and again on the further appeal of the Crown to tho House of Lords.Tho late Government decided that, although it was necessary to pass a Bill validating in general tho chargesf tho legality of which had been put in doubt by the Houso of Lords&apos; judgment, it was bettor on the wholo to make an excop-tion in favour of tho particular class cf ohargoe (those for milk lioonoos) which the Final Court of Appeal had exprosaly found to be ultra vires, in a caso in which the Crown itself was the losing party.   They were also, I understand, anxious not to subject the farmers and agricultural interests con-oornood to further burdens,,   And tho Minister of Health, thenI.CABINET.WAR CHARGES (VALIDITY)BILL.memorandum by tho Proldent of tho Board of Trade.
of Agriculture, gave an undertaking in the House of Commons that the milk charges would he excepted,   I ought however to make it clear that the lloeneees are dealers and not farmers, and whether the dealers will, in fact, pass on to the farmers anything, and if so how much, of what they may get from the Government, it is impossible for me to say.I think I ought also to remind the Committee that, in the course of the only debate which has yet taken place on the subject in Parliament, - in the House of Lords on 19th July last, - Lord Buckmaster, who had delivered the Lords&apos; judgment on the case, said that, while it had been found to be outside the power of the Pood Controller lawfully to oom-pel the dealers to pay this money, it was money which in honour they were bound to pay.   Lord Birkonhead followed-   -to the Bame effect, and the House rejected by 4-2 votes to 29 the lotion calling upon the Government to repay these charges. There is no pretence, I understand, that the milk distributors were unable to make a legitimate profit, and if the 2d. per gallon fees are returned to them, they will be in a favoured position as compared with those who v^ere their competitors in other parts of the country.I understand, however, that , in spite of these difficul-ties, the Minister of Agriculture thinks it desirable to retain the milk exemption; and, in view of the specific undertaking of the late Government, I think we can justify introducing the Bill in this form.The sums involved are as followsTotal amount demanded from licencees 266,000but of this sum there inCDlot yet paid by licenoees, and therefore not repayable to them; but due to the Crown if milk charges are legalized...........................160,000and   (2)Paid by licenoees and repayable to them if the Milk charges are excepted from the Bill...........105,000
Tho Treasury will not have to find any monoy in any event, but will got a larger or smaller amount from tho Pood Trading Aocount, aocording to the deoision taken.The following aro, approximately, the sums paid in foes in respect of the other licences and charges, which would be legalized by the measure;-Flour (Prooluded Purposes) Charge	- over	7,250,000	- about	1,750,000	- about	1,750,000		1,500,000	- about	1,000,000	- about	500,000Hop licences (up to July last)...	- about	222,000Bread Subsidy Eeduotion scheme...		500,000		27,000		io ,6&apos;oo(and one or two others for which the latest figures are not at the moment available).(Intdt) P. L1.-G.Board of Trade,39th January, 1923.
