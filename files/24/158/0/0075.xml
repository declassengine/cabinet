QMMDHISTS AND Tgg UNEMPLOYEDA most interesting document relating to communistorganisation of the unemployed in this oountry has beenreceived:   it appears to emanate from tha Executive Committeeof the Communist International, was dated November Both, 1922,and haB every appearance of being genuine:&quot;To the Presidents of the Delegations of the Russian Communist Party abroad:-&quot;A Committee of Action constituted by the Operative Section of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, under the chairmanship of Comrade Watkins, assisted by Quelch and Baldwin, on the 19th November,   &apos; 1922, undertook to direct the organisation of the unemployed in England, Ireland and Scotland.&quot;The formation of this Committee is made imperative by the necessity to provide the British Communist movement with an autonomous body which will take action in an independent manner, thus directing the whole labour mOTrement into the way of the greatest activity.&quot;The foundation of this Committee of Action will facilitate the work of the. secretariat, which up till now has been severely handicapped from the technical point of view in its relations with the most active groups 6&quot;f the English proletariat.   The electoral campaign in which the role played by the British Communist Party was much smaller than it should have been, has proved how insufficient is tha technical apparatus at the disposal of the Western European Secretariat for its work in England.&quot;It has further proved the importance of the independence of the British groups whioh, thanks to their direct connection with the Executive Committee of the Communist International, would be able much quicker to obtain the instructions which would be needed for the direction of the work among the British proletariat.   It is true that the constitution of a committee of Action will deprive the Secretariat of the use of oertain funds which as from the 19th November, 1922, were placed at the disposal of Comrade Watkins.   This loss, however, will be made up by the Financial Section of the Executive Committee so that the work in hand will not be interrupted.&quot;The Committee of Action, the members of which have already started for England, have first concentrated themselves upon finding appropriate organisation for the unemployed in England.   The unemployed are, of course, the most active element of the advance guard of the British proletariat.   On arrival in London and at Manchester the members of the Committee will immediately proceed to organise looal Committees whose first business it will be to bring to the attention of Mr. Bonar Law the resolutions passed at the congress of unemployed.Thebo/
- &amp; -P -&apos;1 V iV ijBiese resolutions will subsequently be placed before Parliament.   The development of the Committee of Action ; in the future will depend upon the successful solution of this first problem.&quot;The activity of the unemployed should provoke a rupture between the more advanced elements and the section of the working class which may still be regarded as bourgeois.   QJhe Labour Party, although it has shown a certain activity at the reoent elections, would certainly be incapable of providing in the House of Commons an opposition of sufficient strength.   It will be the duty of the Committee of Action to extend the network of the Communist Party in England, and still more so in Scotland.&quot;Elections have proved that the workmen of Manchester are almost ready to accept the full Commxmist programme, and it was only on account of the lack of organisation of the local Communist sections that the workman did not return a anmber of Communist candidates.&quot; This defect must be remedied, and the Executive Committee of the CommuaiBt International will not hesitate before any expense which is needed successfully to place the ideas of the Third International before the workmen of Manchester.&quot;A still more favourable ground for the work of the Communist party is to be found in Scotland, where Communist ideas have penetrated not only to the workmen of the shipbuilding yards and docks, but also to the agricultural labourers.   Communist ideas in fact are very much more popular in Scotland than it had ever been supposed either by the Executive Committee of the International or even by the British labour leaders themselves.&quot;As for Ireland, the network of Communist organisation may be regarded as thoroughly satisfactory and it is hoped it will continue to spread with the same rapidity.   Here the objeot of the Communist International Is to detach the Irish proletariat as quickly as possible from the Jingo bourgeoisie, and thus transform what has been a national revolution into class warfare on behalf of the interests of the working man,    Although Ireland already has Its own organisation, the Committee of Action : would always keep itself in permanent touch with this Irish organisation, to the great advantage of both bodies.&quot;On proceeding to Ehgland the members of the Committee of Action will pet into touch with the organisation of unemployed for Central Europe, and also with the headquarters at Copenhagen,   They will beoome members of the propaganda section for Central Europe of the Secretariat for Western Europe.(Signed)   D. Manouilsky.president of the Operative section.&quot;Further/
Further enquiries are being made into this matter and meanwhile it is probably significant that on January 27ththe political secretary of the Conmunist party issued thefollowing circular to District Party Committees&quot;The Advisory Committee for Unemployment have had before them the immediate situation in connection with -unemployment and you are instructed to push forward as the next step in connection with tha deputation of the General Counoil to Bonar law on Unemployment:-(1)   That the General Council be urged to call a one day&apos;s strike acoompanied by National Protest demonstrations on 13th Feby. the day Parliament reassembles and alBO to urge Labour M.P&apos;s. to join in the strike.     To push the operation of this policy it is necessary that a uniform resolution be drafted appealing against the reply of Bonar Law and urging unemployed committees in the districts to send deputations to all Trade Onion Branches in support of this resolution,(2)   That all Communist Party members should endeavour to push this resolution through their Trade Union Branches, Trades and Labour Councils and local Labour Organisations generally urging that the said resolution be Bent on to the General Council for further action.Wa therefore recommend the following as a draft resolution to be utilised by you in this connection:&quot;In view of the adverse reply of Mr. Bonar Law to the deputation from the General Counoil on unemployment and his refusal to meet the unemployed marchers this -----strongly urges the General Council to call a one day&apos;s strike accompanied by national protest demonstrations on 13th February, the day when Parliament assembles and that all Labour M.P&apos;s. join the one Day&apos;s Strike and take part in the National Demonstrations.&apos;With regard to the lines of the General^Couneil policy for the future these are receiving immediate attention of Committees and we shall be glad to hear from you by return what steps are being taken by your D.P.C. in relation to unemployment and a report of activities in this connection.&quot;COMMUNISTSThe allocation of Russian money among the British communists does not appear to have been definitely settled owing probably to its distribution through channels other thanthose/

Last week Will Hope(&quot;Eepoir&quot;) and Michael Bolland were told that King Streetcould not pay them for any more cartoons in &quot;Tha QomvanlBt&quot;hut both said they would contribute without pay untilconditions improved.District secretaries of the Communist Party have beeninformed by headquarters that:&quot;The Party is desirous of coming into possession of uames of Labour Party candidates who repudiated the Capital Levy or failed to give it prominence at the reoent election and also of prominent members of the Labour Party who have acted contrary to the Constitution of the Party, with details of same.   We should be glad if you would send a short report of the position on this question in your district.&quot;On January 27th the following instructions regardingDistrict Committees&apos; work in connection with munioipal affairs were issued from King Street:&quot;The functions of a District Municipal and Election Committee may be generally summarised as follows:*(a)   It should be the first aim of all District Committees to secure the return of as many Communist Party members as possible to local Government bodies. To direct the activities of all such members holding positions on local bodies along the lines of Party Polioy.   Reasonable scope should, of course, be given to such members to use their own Initiative, but regular consultation between them and the Committee should be insisted on.     With a view to the assistance of those new to Municipal work, members of the committee should make themselves familiar with the powers and duties of all the types of local authorities with whioh they are likely to be concerned.   Information on this subject, together with the aotual experiences of Communists who have served on local bodies, is being collected at Head Office and local committees should lose no opportunity of availing themselves of this.(h)/

We should be glad if you would send a short report of the position on this question in your district.&quot;On January S7th the following instructions regardingDistrict committees work in oonneotion with municipal affairs were issued from King Street:&quot;The functions of a District Municipal and Election Committee may be generally summarised as follows:*(a)   It should be the first aim of all District Committees to secure the return of as many Communist Party members as possible to local Government bodies. To direct the activities of all suoh members holding positions on local bodies along the lines of Jarty Policy.   Reasonable scope should, of course, be given to such members to use their own initiative, but regular consultation between them and the Comaxttse should be insisted on.     With a view to tho assistance of those new to Municipal work, members of the committee should make themselves familiar with the powers and duties of all the types of local authorities with which they are likely to be concerned.

Examples:     (1)(2)into/U w w(fc)   It should be the aim of a District committee to know the approximate chances of success of labour in all its areas.    To ascertain as accurately as possible the electoral strength of labour in all Party divisions and Municipal wards, and to give a lead to the communist Party members in obtaining control of the electoral machinery, and to secure the adoption of Communist Party members through that machinery as official labour candidates.    All political tendencies and currents should be carefully studied and measures adopted to encourage or retard them as the case may be.(o)   To keep the Political Bureau supplied with regular and accurate information on all these points.   Reports should normally be sent in once a month.   The initial report should be as complete as possible, but subsequently only fresh developments should be reportedx&quot;.The final syllabus for Party Training has not yet beencompleted but as the District party Committees are settingup Training Groups the Political Bureau has issued threeprovisional lessons:   an extract from the third lesson isnottfjminteresting:*;;,ftQUB Task towards the State: - -..........(1)    To expose its real nature.(2)    To undermine its authority. . &quot;-v ,.-s.

Shields, 20, Skirving Street, shawlands.   Ihe Party is anxious to avoid %mo minority movements among the engineers and has therefore instructed its distriot organisers to get
into touch with the new groiqas and to push the communist minimum programme.Boilermakers on the Clyde are reported to he working hard to secure the election of Pollitt and Henry to the Trade Union Congress.Prom information received this week it appears that thenew communist paper is not to he a daily at present hut a weekly publication entitled &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;.   The neweditor, Palme Dutt, is anxious to substitute a classconscious mass organ for the existing &quot;magazine of theoreticalarticles and foolish jokes&quot;:   he is working very hard tosecure good material and has made requests to the followingpeople for regular contributions:Manahendra Hath Hoy    -   Indian matter.M. Philips Price        -    German and central european News.Charles Redfern -    Young Communist Leaguematt er.Redfern has also heen asked to become editor of a &quot;Workers&apos; Sports section&quot; in the paper.Palme Dutt, who is also editor of &quot;The Labour Monthly&quot;, has commissioned a Scottish communist to interview Robert Smillie and obtain, if possible, his views on the following questions:-1.    Do you think that the present position of the M.P.G.B. is very much weaker than in the past?2.    Does their present attitude look to you as if they had definitely chosen a policy of doing nothing, or do you think that they haven&apos;t got a policy?3.     Could a forward policy knit the Federation together?4.    Do you know why on earth the officials of the Fife miners pushed out Philip HodgeB and drove him and Kirker into forming a rebel union?5.    If the coal-owners press for an extension of hours, and legislation is brought in for this purpose, ought the general council to aot on its powers and call for a general strike?
6.    Do you think that such a call for a General strike Is likely to be much use unless the General Council is given greater powers than it has at present?7.    Ano. would the wider powers, which you once proposed should he given to the council, be use a unless we have a militant General Council - you will probably agree that the present one is not militant.8.    As the unemployed position is really tha same as two years ago, do you believe that drastic action should be taken - not simply conferences or demands that Parliament should be summoned, but direot mass action as well.9.    fiow can mass action be organised to frighten the ruling class into concessions?  Would a three days1 strike do it?10.     If the necessity for such action is not faced, is there any other way of working for the unemployed that will not be as futile as the efforts of the last two years? iI11. Ought the hunger-marchers who are really feeling the pinch, try to push on the General Council to holder policies?&quot;Distribution committees are now reported to be in working order in Glasgow and Paisley, where &quot;The worker&quot; and &quot;TheCommunist&quot; are being sold from door to door.-The debts contracted by A.E.E.

The systematic collection of the contributions and a financially independent organisation mean an organisatoric and moral strengthening of our trade unions, and prove our inward and exterior strength. Therefore it is necessary to organise the cash collection of the contributions with the conformable earnest.Central-European Bureau of the Red International of labour unions.Chairman: J ^Secretary:      Reinhardt.George Hardy has been ordered by the Mosoow Executive of the Red International of Labour Unions to go to Ireland and the Central European Bureau is anxious to know how he intends to execute this commission.

THB UHBHPLOYEDThere has not been much unemployed activity in London during the past week owing tD the absence of most of the marchers:   it Is reported that the men billet*d under the Poplar Board of Guardians v/ere diainolined to start on the march owing to their comfortable quarters:   Hanningtontherefore^13.1countries&quot; by the International propaganda Committee,dated January 23rd, 1923, it is stated that:-&quot;The I.P.C* of the revolutionary metal workers finds that the following conditions are common to, all the above countries, and should therefore be laid at the basis of the Programme of Action.   The programme should include:The Struggle for Uniting the Craft and Semi-Industrial Unions into single National Unions of Metal Workers.   This question stands out most acutely, though as yet in the field of agitation only, in the Anglo-Saxon countries:     The United States of America, Great 3ritain and Canada...Factory and.Shop Committees and Unemployed Organisations.The AmsterdamerB have painfully evaded this ;juestion:   we must the more energetically carry on propaganda for Shop Committees.   In Germany and Austria we must participate in this movement with all means at our disposal, as there the movement is beginning to play an extremely important part.   In England, France and Italy, we must take the initiative in organising factory and shop committees. We must engage most actively in the work of organising the unemployed.   We must demand in our propaganda the closest contact between the organisations of unemployed and the unions.   We must always expose action such as has taken place in England during the lockout in the spring of 1922, when the reformists of the Amalgamated Engineers&apos; Union hud &quot;explained&quot; that the unemployed have nothing to do with the struggle of their employed oomrades.The International solidarity of the Proletariat, The International Union of the Metal Workers of ;all Countries.This must necessarily be the main object of our work everywhere.   The strike at Ludwighafen (Germany, Pfala) during whioh the organisations affiliated to the Red International of labour Unions have shown the meaning of proletarian solidarity in Seed as well as in word, should be utilised by us.     During large strikes or lookouts in any country, our oomrades must demand most active participation of the metal workers&apos; unions of all countries...&quot;
