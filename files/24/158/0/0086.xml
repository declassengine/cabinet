UNIVERSlflESOE 0X7Q;RD: AMD CAMBRIDGE&apos; -BILL* &apos; MEMORANDUM by the PRESIDENT of the BOARD&apos; qy-EDUCATION...-I circulate, for the information of my&apos;Colleagues, copies of the Universities of Oxford&apos;and Cambridge Bill ana. of a Memorandum [CP.39.73], prepared by my predecessor, on the Report of the Oxford and Cambridge Commission,  &apos;-... The Memorandum is concerned with two main points, (1) ..the proposal of the Royal Commission that the&apos;annual- Government grants to Oxford and Cambridge should be largely, increased; and (2). the Bill providing for the establishment of the statutory Commissions, recommended by the Royal&apos;Commission,:and&apos;the attendant difficulty as regards the position of women at Cambridge,  &apos; -On (1) my view is that the two Universities will not be fairly or wisely treated, unless the annual grants of  30,000 how made to each by the Government,, are substantially increased. &apos;The Royal Commission were careful to explain that ;they recommended &quot;such a grant only from, the State as will meet the most urgent needs of the Universities at the present&apos;time (March, 1922) leaving it to future benefactors&apos; to provide for the less urgent - -.needs and, for further developments&apos;-&apos;from time to time in future years&quot;, and their recommendation was for a grant of  110,000 to&apos; each University - ah increase of  80,000 on the existing grants. I do not suggest, nor would it I think be expected, that the&apos; Government, especially in its present financial difficulties, should increase the grants up to the full figure of  110,000 recommended-, until the statutory Commissions have done their work and secured the necessary reforms.   But the Commissioners are bound to take a
considerable time ever&apos;their heavy task,-, and it seems only fair and prudent that as soon as the&apos; Statutory -Commissions   are aet u.p and&apos; a guarantee is thus forthcoming -that&apos;--the reforms are being *-&apos; -taken in bond, a substantial - instalment-; of - the-, increased -grant ^ recommended should be given.; to enable the Universities.-to meet certain of their most immediately pressing needs, which they could only neglect .at* very -serious risk to their efficiency. ----- -    Since, the grants&quot; of  30,OO0:&apos;&apos;weT&apos;e&apos; given&quot; to oxford and cambridge - in 1919-20 as &quot;emergency grants&quot; the other Universities in lGreat Britain have- had /their annual Treasury grants cons icter-ably increased and have-als&apos;o received-large non-recurrent- grants for what we-may call post-.war reconstruction and for -pension. &apos;&apos; arrears for the older members of their staffs&apos;,   oxford and&apos;&apos; Cambridge have&apos; had ho . such &quot;increases,-, though their needs. have&apos;&apos; grown in &quot;tha same, degree,, and they are now hard put to it to. maintain their existing, departments in reasonable efficiency:&quot;&apos; in particular I may mention that the position&apos; of the great.&quot;   -&quot; University Libraries., v?hich are institutions of first-rate Kaifioh importance, is&apos;giving&apos; rise !tc serious apprehension... .   . &apos;&quot;1 do not wish to; &apos;commit myself, to a&apos; -precise figure&apos; at&apos;&apos; this&apos; moment-,.- &apos;a&apos;s the university&apos; Grants Committee &quot;are still await-in further information on certain&apos;&apos;-points, but from1 what is already&apos; available I - have gathered that&quot;&apos;something like an&apos;additional-:  :  30 jOOO to each of the two Universities would probably meet their most urgent needs and might postpone for several years any seriously demand for further assistance: from the State; . T ask, therefore, that when the Bill is in progress, the Minister in. charge of it -may be authorised to announce that as soon as the statutory Commissions are set up, the, Government will provide additional annual grants for Oxford and Cambridge of a total amount which I will specify more definitely when I have completer information but which in&apos; the meantime I may put at about  60,000.    I may mention that&apos;the annual Treasury Grant now paid to Birmingham
University is  55,000, to Manchester  56,000, to University^&quot; College, London,  60,000, to Glasgow University  63,000, and to Edinburgh  70,000.As regards (2), the position of women at Cambridge is sure to be the subject of considerable discussion and contro-versy during the passage of the Oxford and Cambridge Bill and a decision needs to be taken as to what is to be the attitude of the Government towards this question.I am myself in complete agreement with the conclusion reached by Mr. Fisher that the Bill should contain no direction with respect to the full enfranchisement of the women at Cambridge but that, for the reasons which he gives, the matter should&apos; properly be left to the decision of the university.I agree, however, that, should an amendment be moved making it an Instruction to the Commission to provide for the full admission of women, the Minister in charge of the Bill should indicate the grounds upon which the Government would prefer to leave, the matter for the decision of the University, but that he should announce at the 3ame time that it was not intended to put on the Whips.S.W.8th February, 1923.

REPORT of the OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE COM!SSTOK.Memorandum by the president of the.Board of Eduoation.It is necessary that the Go.TQrr.r.ent should now make up its mind as to the course&apos; to he .pursued with reference to, the Report of the Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge .Universities, for questions have already been asked upon the subject in the House of Commons and Mr, Asquith has given notice of his intention of  raising the question of University Reform, when the University Grants come up for discussion on the Treasury Vote, for which I understand that a day is to be given.   The Report recommends in the main two things;- ;(1) a largely increased State Grant -  110,000 for eachUniversity instead of  30,000 as at present, and inaddition.a lump sum for pension arrears: (2) a number of changes to- secure increased efficiency in organisation, many of which require legislation;    for this .        purpose a Statutory Commission is required, to alterUniversity and College Statutes and to revise Trusts.As regards (1), the position of the Government is rather difficult since (a) the sum provided in the Estimates for Grants for Universities has been reduced this year- by over  200j000, and no money is consequently available at present for increasing the Grants to Oxford and Cambridge, and (b) in any case it is doubtful whether Parliament should give any increased grant to Oxford and Cambridge in advance of the legislation required to enable them to set their houses in order on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission.   It:may be represented by determined reformers that the Statutory Commission^ work should be complete before the giants are increased, but I think this would be unfair to the Universities,
since it might delay an urgently needed addition to their revs; for two years, or more, .and ray own view is that the in6reased g: (the axact amount of. these to be determined by the University Grants Committee of the Treasury) should be paid as soon after setting up of the Statutory Commission as the money can be foundAs regards (2), my opinion is that the sooner the Statutory Commission is set up the better and that the Bill providing for this should be passed through parliament this ses the University of London Act, 1898, supplies a convenient model This is a step which should secure general assent., both in Parliament and in the Universities,   A delicate question, howeve arises with respect to the position of&apos; women at Cambridge and t matter is sufficiently important to engage the attention of the Cabinet.Cambridge is the only British University which has declined to grant full membership to its women students though they are now enabled to receive titular degrees,   This was felt to be1 an anomaly by the Commission, who were unanimously, in favou of the admission of women to full participation in the life and work of the university.   The Cambridge members of the Commission however, were of opinion that the number of women under-graduate should be limited by university Statute to 500.   &quot;We desire stroke they say, &quot;that Cambridge should remain mainly and. predominantly &quot;men^ University&quot;,   Mr, Graham, M.P.-., dissented from-this limitation and in the Minority Report minuted that -^Parliament s &quot;be strongly urged to pass legislation at the earliest possible &quot;moment,   granting full membership; of the&apos;&apos;University on equal ter &quot;with men to women teachers and students at Cambridge&quot;.   This vie will certainly be pressed in the House of Commons and by the Women&apos;s Organisations all over the Country.There are three possible courses-opeo to the Governme (1)    to introduce and pass a Measure framed with the ex-olue^ object of admitting duly qualified women to full msmDer ship of Cambridge university;
(2)    to direct tha Statutory Commission to carry out the general intention of the Royal Commission in this regard;(3)    to do neither of these things but to trust to the reformed University to carry out the change in its own way,Ho doubt the Government will be pressed by the \Vomen&apos;s College&apos; at Cambridge by the Foments Organisations all over the country, and by Members of Parliament acting under pressure from these Organisations to adopt either the first or the second of these courses, preferably the first.   It will be argued that this is a matter in which Parliament should have the courage of its own convictions, that all the other Universities which receive grant from the state do, in fact, admit women to full membership, and that in present circumstances it is impracticable to make the large Parliamentary Grants to a University which disfranchises women,    it will further be urged that since women are entitled to vote for the parliamentary representatives of the university, it is absurd that they should be debarred from the right of helping to organise academic studies.     Mevertheless, though I am personally in favour of the change, I am, on the whole, inclined to leave it to be carried out by a re-constituted University and for the following reasons;-(1) It is in the interest of the women themselves and of the harmonious working of the Mixed University which will be created that the change should be the act of the University itself rather than that it should be imposed upon it from outside. (2) it would be regrettable that Cambridge, which was the pioneer in the matter of University Education.for women, should be deprived of the credit of putting a crown upon the edifice. (3) It seems probable that the compulsory imposition of the change would cause much resentment at Cambridge and
might prejudioe the reception of the other recommendation .   of the Commiseiohi (4) It seems to be highly probable that under the revised Constitution of the University,, opinion favourable to . ^ the. claims of women will prevail, -   (5) It is more in accordance with our British tradition,as well as with my own repeated declarations, that the &apos;  Government should refrain as far as possible from inter-:&quot; fering with the autonomy of a University. .. ;      (6) There is,very little substance in the financialargument, since Parliament does not refrain from voting money to Boys&apos; schools or to Girls&apos; Sohools, and is indeed invited by the Commissioners to make a grant in aid of the Woman&apos;&apos;e Colleges at both universities. On the&apos;other hand,, if the Bill setting up a Statutory Commission contains, as I suggest, no direction with respect t the enfranchisement of the women at Cambridge, a Clause is sure to be moved - in Committee making it an instruction to the Commi sioh to provide for their admission and this, if strongly pressed, might be difficult to resist.   Should such an occasion arise, I am inclined to suggest that the Minister in charge of the Bill should indicate the grounds upon, which the.-Government would prefer to leave the matter for the decision of the unive sity-but that he should announce, at the 3ame time, that-it was not intended to put on the Whips.-(Signed)- H.A. .BTSH3R.Board of Education, S.W. 15th May, 1922.
