jrPHlS Ti TEL PRQPLPSY 0^ HIS BRIITAMIO MAJLSPY1S GOTERmf ilT).I,frqposals for financial assistance to accelerate the development of Imperial Resources.Note by the first lord of the Admiralty.I should like to urge aotion at the earliest possible moment on the lines of the Memorandum of the Secretary cf State for the Colonies and the President of the Board of   ., Trade on the development of Imperial Resources (0.iv90fi;3)), and I would suggest that a decision should be arrived at on this by the Cabinet in order to enable our policy to be announced in the Debate on the Address.   But I wish to plead very strongly for an increase of the amount to be spent under the proposed Bill from  2,000,000 to at least  5,000,000 a year.   I do not suggest that more than  2,000,000, or eben that amount, will necessarily be required in the first year.   The experience of the Empire Settlement Act shows that all sohenes for development in oo-operation with othor Governments of the Empire take time. But  2,000,000, it appears to ne, would barely suffice for the needs of Crown Colony development.   Much larger sums will bo needed if we are to get anything on a large scale undertaken by the Dominions and India.   Mr Hughes recently . telegraphed to the effeot that an Empire i&quot;.oononic Conference would be useless as Australia has already done all she can, and that &quot;v:hat is really wanted is aotion by Britain&quot;,   IfCP.. Ho. 98 (28),CABIIB we
we put the proposed Bill on the Statute Book with adequate provision not only for thio year&apos;s needs but for expansion in future years there will be plenty of work for the proposed Conference in discussing shipping, railway and other schemes under the Bill,I have no doubt,   from ny experience with the Empire Settlement Act, that a measure of this sort, simply giving the general object and the financial limit, and leaving detailed schemes to be settled with the other Empire Governments as they arise, will appeal to the House of Commons and have an easy passage, and will at the same tine meet with a ready response from the DominionsoI, S. A.12th February1923.
