Committee of Home Affairs[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]SECRET. CP. 100(23)Copy No..CABINET.Importation of Canadian Breeding Animals. Memorandum by the, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. $ I 9power of Mini sterto&quot;&apos;&quot; authorise conflationspjirtation of&quot; &quot;(Tafiad Ian animals.I desire to obtain a decision from the Cabinet, with regard to a question as to the admission of Canadian breeding animals into this country under the Importation of Animals Act of last session.The seotion of the Act relating to breeding animals is as follows:&quot;2, The Minister may, notwithstanding anything in theprincipal Act, by order authorise any Canadian animals, other than store cattle, to be landed in Great Britain without being subject to tho provisions of Part I of the Third Schedule to the principal Act, if, in the case of any such animals being cattle, there is produced a certificate issued by a duly authorised offioer of the Dominion of Canada to trie effect that the animals were within one month before shipment effectively tested for tuberculosis and were found to be free therefrom, and if the animals ars, landed in accordance with such conditions, to be prescribed in the order, as may, in the opinion of the Minister, be necessary or expedient for the pre-vention of the introduction of disease, other than tuberculosis, into Great Britain.&quot;In the course of the conference with Canadian representatives in Jiwenftrar last, the Minister of Health (then Minister for Agrioulture), gave them to understand that he would be prepared to introduce such an Order and make it a Government matter.     I do not think, however, that the idea of admitting breeding stock was contemplated by either House of Parliament when the discussion on the Canadian cattle question took place last summer, nor would it appear from the debates last December that either House thought it was being committed to the admission of breeding cattle by Clause 2.The question of the issue of an Order under this Section was recently discussed by the Agricultural Advisory Committee for England and Wales, which is a statutory body representing all agricultural interests and whose function it is to advise the Minister of Agriculture on all questions connected with the industry.
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 14th February, 1923.The Committee strongly object to my making an Order under this Section and it iB certain that breeding societies and other organised bodies of agriculturists will do the same. The Agricultural Advisory Committee urge that the foregoing Section of the Act is permissive and not mandatory.     They contend that anything in the nature of a free importation of breeding stcok goes beyond what the Canadians originally asked for and will tend to lower the standard of stock in this country, .-to improve which so much time and money has been spent.     They also contend that the Seotion was understood as only giving me power to admit cattle of exceptional qualitythat might be required for tha improvement of livestock in this&quot;at,country, on the lines of the importation of Fr-eisian cattle from South Africa last year.The   Agricultural Advisory Committee at their meeting on February 7th passed the following resolution, which was moved by Lord Bledlsloe:&quot;That the Agricultural Advisory Committee recommends that no action be taken under Section 2. of the Importation of Animals Act, 1922, until experience had been obtained as to tho working of Section I.&quot;I should like to have an early decision of the Cabinet as to whether I should make an Order providing for the general admission of Canadian breeding animals, and lay it on the tables of both Houses.R.A.S.
