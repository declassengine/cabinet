ACT, 1920.(Meznqrsridum by the Lord Chancellor)I circulate a draft Bill for giving- effect to the recommendations of my Committee on the decisions in Kerr v. Bryde.It is plain that the slip in the Act of 1920 must he amended.    The Aot permits the &quot;Standard Rent&quot; to bo increased by certain percentages (depending partly on tho increased expenditure of the landlord on structural repairs and improvements), subject to notice of increase being given in the form scheduled to the Act.   This form says nothing about the necessity of giving a notice to quit; and it required a minute analysis of the provisions of the Act by a series of Courts, end ultimately by the House of Lords, to establish that a notice of increase, in order to be valid, must be preceded or accompanied by notice to quit.   This was a trap for the landlords, and many thousands of notices of increase unaccompaniod by notices to quit   have been given by landlords sinoo the passing of the Act of 1920, and accepted and acted upon by the tenants.   Dr. Addison and Sir Kingsley flood, who were responsible for the Act, have declared that it was not the intention of Parliament that notices to quit should be required..   It is only just that these notices should be declared to be and to have always been valid.
The real difficulty is in dealing with cases where the Increases cf reni have not been paid, or having been paid have subsequently bean recovered (by deduction from rent or. otherwise) under,section 14 of,the Act,   There are obvious objections to compelling tenants to pay moneys which (as held by the House of Lords)have.been lawfully withheld; and it is impossible to make the amendment date back for this purpose to the passing of -the Act.   v/ith the Secretary for Scotland I circulated a memorandum to the Cabinet on the 23rd November, 1922 (CP. 4322) recommending the Government to legislate immediately on the lines of&quot; a moratorium suspending for a, period of (say) six. months the right of tenants to recover the rent increases in question, or to set them off against current rents.   The object of this recommendation was to preserve the status quo until the Government should have time to consider the. various questions arising under the Act and to legislate on the whole matter.   Unfortunately, it was found to be impossible, having regard to the, conditions under which the short Session of November-December, 1922, was held, to pass the suggested legislation (which would have been hotly contested) in that Session; but on the 30th November, 1922 the Prime Minister, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, declared that any legislation to amend the   Act in the^ above respect -would he retrospective. . This was generally understood as a warning that any tenants who, after that date, recovered their increases or set them off against current rents on the basis ,of the Act as interpreted by the House of Lords, would not be permitted to retain them;, and it is necessary to give effect to that declaration as from its date.  ,  The Bi.ll therefore provides for this; but as many of the tenants have no doubt spent the rents retaineu and would be unable to pay them up at once, it is proposed
that rents bo retained shall only be recoverable by instalments to be added to the&apos; accruing rente, and in no case to exceed BOfo of the standard rent.   The Bill also keeps alive the right of a tenant, under seotion 2 (2) of the Act, to suspend an increase in the event of the tenement being held by the Court not to be reasonably fit for human habitation or to ho otherwise not in a reasonable state of repair.(Initialled)   C.    ,    .....Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.I..5th February, 1923.
