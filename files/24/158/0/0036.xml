O O AM^JM..?]^^)^.^^^ BRITANNIC MAJffST^S Office/ERNMENT.CABINET.Copy No,Report of the Committee on Housing Policy.Note by the Minister of health in accordance with the conclusions of The Cabinet on January 11th (C,I.(23) Minute 1) I circulate a further report containing detailed proposals of the Cabinet Housing Committee.A.. G. B.January 23rd, 1923.
O :&quot;) A J (j UCommittee on Housing. Report.In their Interim Report of the Gth January CP.6 (23) the omittee drew attention to the admitted serious shortage of small crking olasa houses, to the improbability of unaided private enterprise taking any effective contribution to the relief of this shortage andthe neoessity for acme ocntinuahce of the Rent Restriction Act, and jhey desire to emphasise the conclusion at which they had then arrived hat some further State assistance for house building is essential.The Finanoial Seoretary to The Treasury dissents from this onolusion and from those which fellow for the reasons given in the emorandum C.P.9(2I?) previously circulated, by him.The Committee have considered various possible methods of Issistance and have endeavoured to frame a scheme which would comply with he following principles -t      (a) Any State assistance shoujd be strictly limited. 1      (b) Assistance should not be available for a period beyond that for which the Rent Restriction Aot is continued, (o) Assistance should be limited to the class of houses which*unaided private enterprise is not likely to provide to any extent, that is, to true working clasb houses of small size, (d)   The scheme should definitely aim at the revival of private enterprise, and (e) Central control should be reduced to the minimum.Any scheme that may be adopted will be open to criticism, iut after a very careful consideration the Committee recommend the following proposals as being.open to least  objeotion and as likely to result in some effective contribution towards meeting the present needs.(a)   The Government assistance Bhould take the form of the grant to local authorities of nn annual subsidy per house of a defined the lepal authorities being permitted to aeoure the provision of louses first, by the encouragement of private enterprise and secondly, jjy building themselves.     The Government contribution ahould be a fixed
0 o iAnnual sum-of the same amount in either case and should be approximately one half the estimated annual loss on houses of the prescribed type, [he remainder of the loss should be borne by the local authorities who jdll thus be given a direct financial interest and who will be directly concerned, in so far as they may build themselves, to prevent inflation of prices.(b)    The local authorities should be informed that it is Irimarily the intention of the Government to secure the revival of -private enterprise and they should be asked to submit and adopt proposals for assisting private enterprise before undertaking building Ihemselves.   The means which they should adopt to bring in private ^enterprise may include some or all of the following -Capital grants to builders - the State contribution being available to meet approximately half the charges on loans raised by the authorities to provide these grants.Annual grants to building societies in respect of some part of the capital provided by the societies for houses of the defined type.Annual allowances for a term of years on account of rates on assisted houses.It will be necessary to ensure that in operating any of these proposals local authorities will provide a subsidy at least equivalent to the Government subsidy. Departmental administrative action should puffice to secure this.(c)   31th regard to the building of houses by local I&amp;uthorities themselves sanction should not be given to local authorities jp embark on a general programme covering the whole period of State Ipslstance, but the numbers of houses which local authorities may pect should be authorited from time to time having regard to tha availability of building labour.     This precaution is necessary in fder to strengthen the control of prices.
(d) Assistance should only be available In respect of houses completed&apos; three months before the expiration of the Kent Restriction &apos; Act - i.e. by June 1925, if the Cabinet accept the recommendationI of the Onslow Committee which, it is understood, will be in favour of bringing the Act completely to an end at Michaelmas 1925.(e) Assistance should be limited to houses of the smallestI type, maximum and minimum sizes being defined.     In England and Wales it is proposed that the largest assisted house should be a house containing kitchen,   scullery and three bedrooms, and the smallest aI house containing kitchen, scullery and two bedrooms.       In scotland the largest assisted house should be the same as that in england hut the smallest should be a house containing living room, bedroom I! and scullery, the average size of rooms being greater in Scotland.tiuax [I in England,As regards the amount of the annual State subsidy, the Committee reccom6nd that they should be given authority to discuss this matter with representatives of local authorities starting with an offer   of say  3 a house for 20 years, but that the Committee should be empowered to negotiate up to a maximum of  4 a year for 20 years,As additional means Of assisting the provision of houses the Committee recommend that local authorities should be enpowered temporarily to lend, money to builders at the lowest rate which will I not involve loss and that they be given power to borrow for this I purpose.     It is also recommended that the Small Dwellings AcquisitionAct, skpuld be amended to enable local authorities to lend money up I to - fit of value to intending occupiers during the construction of houses, and that certain minor amendments should be made to facilitate the working of this Act.The proposals outlined will involve legislation which will take some little time to obtain, and in the meantime it will probably &apos; e necessary to allow some local authorities to proceed with limited ischemes of building:   The Committee recommend that such schemes if
nconforming to the general conditions laid down in this Report  t&quot;&quot;i&quot;&apos;0 should be eligible for the new State grant, notwithstanding that they may have been commenced before the necessary statutory authority has been obtained.     This recommendation covers the schemes which some looal authorities are now carrying out or are about to begin without promise of any State subsidy.On the other hand the Committee feel that in view of the present negotiations between employers and operatives in the building industry on wages and hours of labour, it is desirable to postpone for aa long as possible any announcement of the Government&apos;s intention to give financial assistance for housing.4,        Slums.The Committee recommend that for the present the State subsidy in aid of slum Improvement schemes should be confined to the  200,000 a year -which has already been announced and that the existing law under which the State Is liable for all losses on such schemes where a local authority&apos;s housing expenditure exceeds the produce of a penny rate, should be amended to permit of a limited State contribution.The Committee have had under consideration a scheme for facilitating the improvement of slum areas which are not bad enough to warrant immediate clearance, by enabling owners or, in their default, the local authority to appoint an administrator to carry out such improvements as may be necessary and to manage the property in the meantime.     An outline of this scheme is appended and it is suggested that legislation on these lines should be undertaken, local authorities should also be empowered to borrow money to defray the cost of repairs to unsatisfactory houses in cases where they cannot immediately recover the cost from the owners.ARTHUR G. BOSCAWEN. Chairman.January 2Srd, 1925.
