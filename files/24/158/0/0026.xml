THE COMMUNISMS&apos;:i 0Interesting instructions regarding o*raires?ist finance have been sent to a trusted representative in this country:   they read as follows:nTo All Sections of the Comintern.The Secretariat herewith informs the Seotion of the Comintern of the decision of the Budget Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International must pay the travelling expenses (there and back) of the Delegates they send to th? Executive Committee of the Communist International.The Executive Committee of the Communist International will pay the travelling expenses of representatives of sections only in the event of the particular comrades being commissioned directly by the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.Secretariat of the Executive Committeeof the Communist International.*. KolivrovTfl All Sections of the CominternThe Executive Committee of the Communist International has resolved that regular affiliation dues must be paia to the Comintern.Up to the present time this decision has been applied only by severs! of the largest parties.     For that reason the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, once again drawing the attention of the sections to the above-mentioned decision, requests that sections commence to pay their dues as from January 1st, 1923-.     The extent of the dues is determined by the economic position of the working class in eaoh country.We ask all Parties to. report quarterly to the Budget Commission the amount of membership dues collected.Secretariat of the Executive Committeeof the Communist International.W. ilelarov,.&quot;In this connection mention may be made of the fact that on JTanuarr:12tli.. Boll informed the Manchester District secretary that &quot;we are at the roek-bottoroto-day/
to-day and It is impossible to grive any encouragement by way of finance&quot; to the scheme for taking over printing plant in Manchester.According to a statement made by one of the delegates to Moscow last month the Third International Congress decided that Great Britain must be isolated politically and unrest throughout the Empire assiduously and persistently fostered.The current issue of the &quot;Hotes fcr Speakers&quot;circulated by headquarters deals mainly with the -Trenchoccupation of the Buhr district end contains thefollowing passages:.Wherever the Treaty has been applied economic ruin has followed snfi intensified suffering has come to the workers.     Test it by our experience,,,&quot;The Versailles Treaty is the central weapon of the offensive of capitalism, driving the workers to the coolie level of existence, economically   and transferring all the burdens of the war on to the backs of the suffering masses, whilst politically subordinating millions of people to the victorious cliques of imperialists;&apos;...&quot;The true character of the upholders of the Treaty especially in their relation to the working class, is equally clear in the attitude of the French Government towards thu working class leaders of Prance.     The leading cor-rrurlsfis who met i.n Essen with the workers1 leaders of Britain, Germany, Belgium and Holland,have been arrested ar.5 imprisoned for protesting against the &quot;imperialism of the French Government..     Trade nhioyjists are threatened with the Death Pen&amp;Tty if th^^vJse^their Union &quot;to proTest by str Ike&quot;&quot;action ,&apos;r  &quot;&apos;Have&quot; &quot;one Workers of &quot;Europe, lost ten mTTlTons dead on it3 battlefields for this?     Is this the liberty m&amp; democracy for which we were told the war was fought?&quot;Against these actions we must protest.   Against the fPriaty itself we must protest and fight.     The British workers must refuse to support any Government which stands for the Versailles Treaty.&quot;Parliament is out of session.     Parliament must meet at once and disassociate this country from the action of the French Government andrepudlate/
repudiate the Versailles Treaty.    Either tiiis, or the Labour Forces must organise mass resistance and prepare to take the rains of power.&quot;There is no possible solution to the European tangle apart from the creation of a United states of Europe composed of Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Government pursuing a  socialist economy.&quot;To acheive this object the workers must bring their organisations together nationally and internationally and make a United Front with the Communist International against Capitalism and to destroy the Treaties of Imperialism.&quot;Some of the British delegates who have just returned from Moscow appear to be very disappointed with the Fourth Congress which they state was &quot;packed&quot; and arranged:   the English delegation was reprimanded by Zinoviev for having no definite plan of action and the Executive Committee has been officially notified to this effect,     Leckie spent most of his time asking for English translations and says that these were deliberately delayed until too late to be of any use.Harry Webb stated recently that the Executive . Committee of the Comintern has decided to send an organiser to India, Afghanistan and Persia end the British communist Party has been asked to suggest a suitable man. T.A, Jeckson has been approached but is not inclined to teke the work.The Chief Constable informs me that the Yorkshire District Party Committee was held at Shipley on January 6th and elected the following committee:Registration Distribution FS nance propaganda P ar i i ame nt er y &amp; Municipal education the chair was taken by S.

li&amp;nchester.&apos; 0   oThe following interesting circulars have been sentto District Party Committees by the political secretary;&quot;The Amalgamated Engineering Union is about to appoint delegates to the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party Conference.     If there are any Bui table members in your district whom you consider suitable for nomination, I shall be glad if you will let me have their faame3 as soon as possible, Also, if you have not already done so, will you please let me have the names of any member you can recommend as parliamentary candidate for the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Boiler Makers&apos; Society and the Woodworkers.     As you will see from a previous letter to you, nominations are also required for   Trace Union Congress and Labour Party delegates in the ce,se of the Woodworkers.&quot;Trade Union Journals&quot;Owing to the lack of publicity on Trade Union matters, it is essential for the work of the Central Industrial Committee to secure a regular supply of all journals and. reports issued by Trade Unions.     It is, therefore, necessary for you to arrange for a representative of the various unions represented to make himself reponsible for sending reE&amp;l&amp;r.i2. ^0 headquarters fc copy of his union Journals,,     Stress should be l&amp;id on the importance of the supply being regular.     I shall be glad if you will take immediate steps to make the necessary arrangements, as the matter is one of great urgency.&quot;&quot;Your district no doubt intends to call or irijiy have already called a delegate conference to receive the report of the delegates to the Southport Conference.     As the decision of the Southport Conference leaves the position unchanged, the Communist policy, published in the paper on December SSro, of which I enclose a copy, still holds good, and it is more than ever important that these demands should be pressed forward.     If you know; of any members of the Party who are attending the district conference, will you please see that the enclosed programme is mtde known to them.     I shall be glad to receive &amp; report of the conference, and any other information relating to the position in your district.&quot;0.he necessity for obtaining reports from the mining districts is largely due to the fact that the miners do not issue periodical journals.     The mining unions are the only unions which do not issue some sort of regular journal or report.     This means that a valuable source of propaganda is lost to the rank and file miners.     The question of publishing a journal for each mining district, which might also take the form of a local labour paper for the district, should be raised at every lodge end district meeting.     It might be urged that thepresent/
present is not a favourable time to raise a f***Xproposal of this kind, but if other unions in a similarly impecunious position can afford to issue journals, there is no reason why the miners should not be able to do so.     I should like to have your view on this question.&quot;The communist policy to which reference is madeabove covers:(1)     Termination of the present agreement and an increase   of wages to 80$ above 1914 rates,(2)     Cancellation of the accumulated arrears of standard profits.(3)    Agitation, in conjunction with the Labour Party, for the enforcement and operation of the Sankey Report and -nationalisation of the mines.(4)    Agitation in conjunction with the Trade Union Congress against an attempt to lengthen &quot;working hours .It Is reported that strong communist nuclei have have been formed In the Co-oper&amp;tive movement.Helen Crawfurd is in London and states that several of the communist groups are very short of money: Aberdeen is   bankrupt, Edinburgh frequently has to call in subscriptions, Newcastle has hardly any funds and Glasgow is badly affected   by internal dissension.James Sfcand, who is now living in Lanarkshire sent the Communist Party a donation of  50 in December last.The Communist Party is attempting to collect overdue literature accounts and has sent to the Scottish organiser a demand for literature supplied amounting to over  95: the Lancashire organiser has also been asked to collect accounts amounting to  78. TEE RED INTERN ATIOHAL 0?

Then! will return for the meeting in London and try and get committees In Liverpool and Southampton before leaving for home...&quot;How   all seem very optimistic in the Transport Workers at our attempt to do something.     I may say they agree also with me that our propaganda take the line of principle instead of attacks upon individuals,     I can inform you from reliable transport sources that the National Transport Workers1 Federation - therefore Bob Williams position - will be liquidated inside of 2 months. Bo one seems to know what he is going to do.&quot;-Preparations arc being made to further the interest -of the Miners&apos; Minority Movement at the forthcoming conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.The Amalgamated Engineering Union Minority Committee of the Red International of Labour Unions is circulating its minimum programme which includes:(l)     a national minimum wage of ?A per week.(2)     Reduction of working hours to 44 hours per week and the abolition of overtime.(3)     General opposition to any system of payment by results.(4)     Formation of workshop committees under terms of Shop Stewards, such committees   to oonirol piece work prices and other working conditions.(5)/m

at Tower Bridge Police Court on January 12th:   the result of the case was a great shock to the unemployed who imagined that the defendants would be merely spectators of a legal duel.On January 11th two unemployed men named William Dodd and Charles Wright were sentenced at Button Police Court to three, months1 herd labour:     they had set fire .to a mattress in Belmont Workhouse but, in order to save the expense of a trial at the Assizes, the charge was reduced from arson to wilful destruction.The Chief Constable of Coventry informs me that on January 10th four unemployed marchers passed through that city on their way home;   they were cold and irjigry mi had no money and admission to the Casual Ward was obtained for them by a police officer to whom three of tho men expressed great dissatisfaction with the -unemployed leaders.At a meeting of the London District Council of Unemuloved hell on January 3th it was decided to send officials to L^wiiiham.

At the Sinn Fein Executive Committee meeting on January 11th he wanted a new &quot;Republican Fund&quot; started and said more collections must be made.     The Committee did not agree with him.Patrick Walsh, who was among those men recently arrested, was Chief Transport Officer in Liverpool. He has now been replaced by a man named H. Breen and immediately after the arrests had been made men were despatched from London to clear the remaining &quot;dumpH&quot;.Reliable information has been received as to Republican arrangements for obtaining war material; briefly, it may be said that no very large quantities are obtained from the Continent, only a few revolvers and a few thousand rounds of ammunition at a time, smuggled either direot into Ireland or by way of England and Scotland by seamen and others.     The main supply coraes from America either by way of Liverpool or direct into Irish ports,    A lesser quantity is procured In this country and sent to Ireland as merchandise or smuggled in by seamen or by women employed as oouriers.    For this purpose a speoially constructed garment is worn under the ordinary clothing.On January 11th Glasgow Police raided the Banba Hall, Mary hill Road (Joe Robinson^ Headquarters) andarrested/
