(This Docament isathe Property of His Britannic Majestys Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET. CP. 34 (23).CABINET.THE PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE WAR COMPENSATION court to DUBLIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH reference to this subject, the following papers are submitted for the information of my colleagues : 1. Memorandum by Sir Francis Greer, dated the 7th August, 1922.2. Letter from the Lord Chief Justice to Sir Frederick Lidded, dated the2nd November, 1922. 3. Letter from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Lord chief justice, dated the 20th December, 1922. 4. Lord Hewarfrs reply to the above, daced the 15th January, 1923.There are large claims outstanding against the War Office in Ireland on account of requisitions made or action taken during and after the great war. These claims were incurred partly under D.O.R.A. and partly under the Restora-tion of Order in Ireland Regulations. The War Office has settled a large number by negotiation, and where claimants are unwilling to accept the terms offered by the War Office they can have resort to the War Compensation Court in London. The Free State Government, however, contend that the Irish claimants, by reason of their great reluctance to bring their claims to London, are gravely prejudiced in bargaining with the War Office. For the last twelve months they have been pressing for the institution of a branch of the War Compensation Court in Dublin.For reasons with which my colleagues are familiar, His Majesty&apos;s Government are dependent upon the good offices of the Free State Government for passing through their Legislature an Act of Indemnity in respect of acts done by the British forces under martial law. The Free State Government agreed to pass such a measure on the distinct understanding that a branch of the War Conipensa-tion Court would be established in Dublin. The Bill has already passed the Lower House, and the Free State Government are now pressing that effect should be given to this undertaking. Questions on the subject are being asked in the Irish Parliament.As his letter shows, the Lord Chief Justice, supported by the members of the War Compensation Court, is opposed to the creation of. a branch in Dublin, and suggests as an alternative the institution of an Irish Court to deal with these claims upon the foundation of an Irish Statute. To this course there are two objections which seem to me conclusive. Many of the claimants were loyal supporters of the British Government, who had a right to expect that its requisi-tions would be finally settled in a British court. In the second place, the whole cost of the awards has to be met by the British Treasury, and I cannot, therefore, advise that their assessment should be relegated to an Irish Court.Another alternative which I have considered is the remission of these claims either to a special commission or to a new branch of the Compensation Commis-sion, of which Lord Shaw (now retired) was the first chairman. But the view expressed by Lord Hewart in paragraph 9 of his letter of the 20th December that these claims ought to be settled in accordance with the principles evolved by the War Compensation Court, and in the light of its experience seems to me unanswerable and therefore fatal to any proposal to entrust the settlement of the Irish claims to a new and separate tribunal.the objections urged by Lord Hewart to the hearing of cases in Dublin by. [9402]&apos; B
the Court are certainly formidable; but the difficulties could, I am satisfied be minimised in practice if substantial advantages were offered to claimants willing to come to London 1. In the form of a liberal allowance for expenses except in frivolous cases -2. By the prompt hearing of claims brought to London for settlement.These advantages would, I believe, attract the majority of claimants to London, and would obviate the necessity of opening an office in Dublin. But the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Free State Government will not be redeemed unless the Court holds periodic sittings in Dublin for the benefit of those claimants who insist upon having their claims settled in Dublin.The necessity laid upon His Majesty&apos;s Government of honouring these obligations is the dominant factor in the situation. I am constrained therefore to request the authority of the Cabinet to inform the Lord Chief Justice that His majesty&apos;s Government, after the most careful consideration of his views, feel themselves honourably bound by their engagements to the Government of the Free State, and express a hope that he will see his way to effecting an arrange-ment on the lines suggested in this Memorandum.DEVONSHIRE.January 23, 1923.(1.)Statement for Lord Chief Justice by Sir Francis Greer, August 7, 1922.&quot;When the question of settling the method of determining claims for criminal injuries to persons and property during the Irish conflict was discussed between the representatives of the British Government and the representatives of the Provisional Government, the Provisional Government pressed that the jurisdiction of the tribunal to be established for dealing with claims for these criminal injuries to property should be extended to cover claims arising out of action taken by the British authorities under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations in requisitioning property, &amp;c.The representatives of the British Government resisted the proposal of the Provisional Government. The charge for compensation for criminal injuries was to be borne partly by the British and partly by the Irish Government, and on this account it was reasonable that the tribunal dealing with criminal injury cases should include a representative of the Provisional Government. The charge for compensation in respect of action taken under the regulations, on the other hand, would fall wholly on the. British Government, and the Provisional Government, therefore, were not entitled to representation on the tribunal. The representatives of the British Government contended that the claims in question were identical in character with those arising under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, that there was a court the War Compensation Court already constituted to deal with claims of this character which had established definite principles for the assess-ment of compensation in such cases, and that it was open to Irish claimants-or would be if the terms . of reference to the court were slightly extended-to prosecute their claims before that court.The representatives of the Provisional Government ultimately agreed to the principle that the claims in question should be treated in the same manner and by the same tribunal as claims in Great Britain arising out of the war; that is to say, by the War Compensation Court acting on the principles which have been adopted for the assessment of compensation under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, &amp;o. The Provisional Government, however, stipulated that if the War Compensation Court was to be constituted the court for dealing with these Irish claims, the court should hold sittings in Dublin, on the ground that to compel claimants for comparatively small sums to bring forward their claims m London would amount to a denial of justice and force the claimants to accept whatever amount might be offered to them by way of compensation by tlie compensation officers appointed by the War Office to settle such claims.As it was essential .in the interests of the British taxpayer, by whom the compensation must be provided, that these Irish claims should be settled on tne same principles as claims arising under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, an the only court capable of applying these principles was the War Compensate
Court, the representatives of the British Government agreed to the stipulation made by the Provisional Government.It is difficult to form any estimate of the amount of additional work which would be thrown on the War Compensation Court or of the number of sittings necessary to be held in Dublin. The only data available are those supplied by the Directorate of Lands of the War Office. The number of outstanding claims in respect of the occupation of lands and buildings in Ireland under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations is about 2,051. Of these, about 2,000 are estimated to amount to less than  500 each, and to about  210,000 in the aggregate. The remaining fifty odd. are estimated to amount to more than  500 each and to about  50,000 in the aggregate. The Lands Directorate have Treasury authority to settle any individual claim up to  500, and the extension of their powers to claims under  1,000 is under consideration.It is not contemplated that it will be necessary to hold anything like continuous sittings in Dublin, or that it will be necessary to hear all the Irish eases in Dublin. It will probably be sufficient if sittings are held in Dublin from time to time; but what will be essential is the establishment of an office of the court in Dublin to which claims may be sent and from which information may be obtained.It is recognised that if the War Compensation Court is to undertake to deal with these Irish claims, the number of the members of the court will have to be increased, and that additions to the staff will be necessary. It is also recognised that some time must elapse before the new members of the court and of the staff can become thoroughly conversant with the principles upon which the court acts; but it is hoped that if time is allowed during which the new members of the court and staff may make themselves acquainted with these principles, the court as so strengthened might be able to undertake the settlement of the Irish claims without unduly delaying or interfering with the existing business of the court. If additional members of the court and of the staff are appointed, they would be appointed in the same manner as the existing members and staff; the Provisional Government would have no voice in their appointment.Shortly, the proposals are 1. That the War Compensation Court should deal with claims arising underthe Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations; 2. That for this purpose the court should establish an office in Dublin andshould from time to time hold sittings in Dublin; 3. That such additions should be made to the members of the court and tothe staff as would be necessary to enable the court to discharge its newfunctions without detriment to its existing work.Unless the War Compensation Court can see their way to undertake these new functions, the British Government will be much embarrassed, having regard to the promises given to the Provisional Government.If the court are willing to undertake the new functions, perhaps they would be good enough to make suggestions as to how the proposals had best be carried out, and the extent to which additions to the members of the court and their staff would be required.(2.)Sir Frederick Liddell, K.C.B., War Compensation Court,Offices of the Parliamentary Counsel, Winchester House,Whitehall, S.W. 1. 21, St. James s Square,London, b. W. 1,Dear Sir Frederick Liddell, November 2 1922I have now had an opportunity of discussing.with my colleagues ot the War Compensation Court your letter and memorandum of the 5th August, as regards the reference to the Court of claims arising out of action under the Restoration ot Order in Ireland Regulations. ,    ...    ,,.,.     ,2. We are unanimously agreed in our readiness to undertake this additional work, if the Government desires that we should undertake it, upon the same principles as those which we at present apply under the Indemnity Act, [9402] B 2
For this purpose presumably legislation would be necessary, and we should be glad to have the opportunity of considering any draft proposals to this end.3. We are, however, also unanimous in considering that any sitting in Dublin would be quite unnecessary. The Court and the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission previously have dealt with a large number of Irish claims at sittings in London without any protest being raised, and it has indeed been our experience that Irish claimants not only acquiesce in the choice of London for the Courtfs sittings, but tend to welcome it. I gather that you do not appear to attach very great importance to the figures in your memorandum as regards the number of claims which would be involved. Upon the basis, however, of the figures which you supply, this view on the part of the Court is considerably strengthened. The great bulk of the claims would appear to be for small amounts, under , 500, and the Court have, unofficially indicated that they would not raise any objection to an extension of the existing limits (for this purpose only) to a lump sum of  1,000 and an annual payment of  1,000 within which the War Office might be empowered to settle upon the principles laid down by the Court. I may acid that the experience of the Court does not lead them to believe that the interest of claimants would necessarily suffer in the way apprehended by the Provisional Government at the hands of local War Office agents empowered to make settle-ments by consent without reference to the Court. Further, the Court do not consider that any serious hardship could be caused to claimants with substantial claims involving more than  1,000 lump sum or annual payment if they were required to. attend a hearing in London in a neutral atmosphere; this last is a consideration which the Court are inclined to regard as of considerable importance.4. i have not laid stress upon the additional expense which would be involved in taking the Court over to sit in Dublin, and also taking over the responsible administrative officers of the Department and those officers who are already paid for presenting the Departments view at hearings before the Court. This cou-sideration of expense, however, applies even more strongly to the proposal that the Court should establish a branch office in Dublin. Quite apart from the admini-strative difficulties involved, which would be very considerable owing to the fact that the Court staff is at present cut down to the bare minimum necessary for the efficient conduct of the work,, the Court&apos;s experience has conclusively shown that it has been possible to deal with claimants not only from Ireland, but from the remotest parts of England and Scotland, quite effectively by correspondence without the necessity oi- any local branch offices. Moreover, any grievance or hardship by way of extra expense that might be caused to claimants, their counsel, advisers or witnesses might be met by the Court ordering a sufficient and reasonable sum to be paid, and this expense, in the opinion of the Court, would he far less than that which would be caused by the hearing of oases in Ireland, and all that that would involve.5. The absence of detailed and trustworthy estimates make it difficult for me to make any suggestions as regards the additions which might be necessary to the Members of the Court and of their staff, and I think that the matter must be post-poned for consideration until more definite data can be supplied.Yours sincerely, (Signed)        HEWART.(3.)Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1, Dear Lord Hewart, December 20, 1922.You will perhaps remember that about this time last year the late Government decided that an Indemnity Bill, to protect the military and Crown servants generally against the legal consequences of acts done in execution of their duties in Ireland, was. to be one of the first measures to be introduced at the next&apos; .on and to the session. Owing to. difficulties in setting up a court, to, deal with compensati the. state of public business, the introduction of this measure priorestablishment of the Free State- was impracticable.   It was felt that when th Free State had been established the necessary protection against proceedxngs the Free State courts could not be-secured except by legislation in the Eree &quot; Parliament, and the. Free State Government, having been approached on W subject, recognised their obligation to undertake the necessary legislation,
have accordingly included an Indemnity Bill in their programme of immediate legislation. They adhere, however, to. their original stipulation (which was accepted by the late Government) that we should establish a branch of the War Compensation Court with an office in Dublin, which would also hear cases there when necessary.I realise to the full the objections to this course, which are stated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of your letter of the 2nd November to Sir Frederick Liddell, but the course of events has left us no choice in the matter. There is, so I understand, a vacancy at present in the War Compensation Court. The suggestion I submit for your consideration is that, in addition to the member to be appointed to fill the vacancy, a member should be added on account of the Irish work; and that these two members should be appointed on the understanding that they would be prepared to sit when necessary in Dublin. It is thought that the late Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Sir John Ross, would be eminently suitable for the work, and would also be likely to accept the offer of such an appointment.The necessary jurisdiction would be conferred by a commission from His Majesty, and, if considered desirable, this might be supplemented by a corresponding authority from the Irish Free State Government.I should be glad to hear whether these proposals would commend themselves to your judgment.Yours sincerely, (Signed)        DEVONSHIRE.(4.)His Grace The Duke of Devonshire,K G. P.C., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., War Compensation Court.Colonial Office, SW. 1. Winchester House21, St. James s Square, o. IV. 1, Dear Colonial Secretary, January 15, 1923.1. With further reference to your letter dated the 20th December last, 1 do not know whether it is too late to consider the matter from a somewhat different point of view. In other words, is it certain that it might not be better to set up a purely Irish Court to deal with purely Irish claims, upon the foundation of an Irish Statute, and regulated by such principles of compensation as might appear to be fitting ?2. I am anxious not to repeat the observations contained in my letter of the 2nd November, but my colleagues and I cannot help thinking that the estabhsh-ment or purported establishment of an English Court, or a branch of it, by the English Government or by a Commission, from His Majesty to sit in Dublin and assume to try cases there might give rise to difficult and dubious constitutional questions, both as to jurisdiction, and as to the powers of the Court, and might even place the members and officers of the Court and some, at all events, of the parties attending the proceedings in a grave position. Even if the Free State Government were to invest the War Compensation Court with power to try Irish cases in Dublin, is it not more than possible that in the present condition of affairs such a tribunal, being alien and therefore obnoxious to.certain elements in the population, might be involved in a situation so anomalous as seriously to impede and embarrass the proper conduct of their proceedings ? We cannot help thinking, too, from such information as we have been able to obtain as to recent experience in similar investigations, as well as from our own experience, that at present, if this tribunal is to try the proposed cases, it is by a hearing in London that independent evidence, fair hearing, thorough examination, and a just result can be obtained.3. The foregoing difficulties appear to us to be formidable, but as is indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of my letter of the 2nd November the question also of expense is by no means simple. The cost of taking over (a) the Court and necessary staff, (b) the responsible administrative officers of Departments, and (c) those officers who are already paid for presenting the Departments&apos; cases before the Court, or, alternatively, the further expense of briefing Irish Counsel, would be very heavy and entirely new. In any event, witnesses for the claimants would have to be brought to Dublin, and as against this new expenditure a sitting in London merely adds the extra cost of transit to and from London, which in such cases the Court allows.
c4. The establishment of a branch office of the Court in Dublin might well be an expensive matter. Such a branch would need an efficient and.highly trained staff. The problems presented to the staff of the Court, with which members of the staff must be familiar and competent to deal, are extremely complicated. Our staff at present is too small, having already been cut down to the minimum required for the Courfrs present work, and it is impossible to send over persons on whom reliance can be placed without crippling the present staff, especially after recent changes in the Secretariat. If it were attempted, there would be constant reference to the Court in London, with great waste of time. For the last seven and a half years there has been no difficulty in dealing with all these matters by correspondence. There has been no branch office in Edinburgh or Ireland, and. there has been no complaint.5. The force of the objections has no doubt been present to the minds of those who have to deal with the matter and has been realised by them, and tho suggestion that two new members should be appointed and required to sit in Dublin has been carefully considered by us in order to see if it might offer a solution.6. Such a solution would not get rid of the great difficulties connected with the question of a branch office in Dublin.7. The vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Hamilton should, in our judgment, in view of the state of English and Scottish business, be rilled by a member of the Court available to sit in England and Scotland only, and we do not, for reasons already given, think it would be right to ask him to undertake to sit in Dublin.8. If two new and additional members were appointed, and undertook to and did sit in Dublin, they would find themselves in a position of extraordinary difficulty.9. With its great experience this Court as at present constituted is able to deal satisfactorily with questions arising under a most difficult, novel and complex statute. Principles of compensation have been gradually made clear, legal questions have been slowly settled, and delicate limits of jurisdiction have been adjusted. But fresh and difficult points constantly arise which can effectively be dealt with only by those who have had thorough experience of the Courfs whole working, if the consistency of practice which is essential is to be attained.10. Two new members sitting in Dublin even of the highest legal capacity-would find it impossible to dispose of cases on the lines established by this Court, without either having to interpret the Indemnity Act and apply it in their own way, or having constantly to refer to the War Compensation Court in London. Such a course does not obtain for the claimants or for the Government the advantage sought in the proposal to confer an Irish jurisdiction on the War Compensation Court. Indeed, it might only create fresh disadvantages for both parties.11. Much as i regret to say so, the anxious consideration which we have given to your letter of the 20th December strengthens the view already expressed.Very truly yours, (Signed)        HE WART.
