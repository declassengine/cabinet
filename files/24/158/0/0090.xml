This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.Copt No. 1 1CP. 89 (33).THE CABINET.THE GARRISON IN EGYPT.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the following memorandum on the Garrison of Egypt. Upon its size in the future depend the extent and cost of the barrack programme there, and in this connection I invite particular attention to the eleventh paragraph.D.The Wae Office,9th February, 1923.Accommodation fob Teoops in Egypt.1. The present garrison* of Egypt consists of: 1 Cavalry brigade (headquarters and 3 regiments). 1 brigade Royal Horse Artillery (headquarters and 3 batteries). 1 brigade Royal Field Artillery (headquarters and 3 batteries).   4th battery temporarily in Iraq.1 brigade Pack Artillery (headquarters and 3 batteries).   4th battery in Aden. 6 battalions (excluding 1 battalion in Sudan). 1 Armoured Car company. 2 Field companies. Ancillary services.Total Army strength about 12,000. There are also 3 squadrons Royal Air Force.The garrison is located mainly in Cairo, Abbassia (4 miles outside Cairo), Alexandria, Isinailia and Moascar. The detailed distribution is shown in the table attached as Appendix A.In 1914, the strength (excluding the Sudan) was about 5,000.2. During the period of negotiation prior to the Proclamation of Egyptian Independence, the Egyptian Government showed some disposition to insist on the removal of British troops from Cairo and Alexandria, and on the ultimate restriction of our garrison to places in the Canal zone.Lord Allenby and the General Staff insisted that our Imperial interests in Egypt could not be safe-guarded by purely local defence of the Canal.,3. The question was discussed at a meeting of a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet on 24th October, 1921 (CP. 3458). Lord Curzon then suggested that our existing garrisons should be retained in Cairo and Alexandria for 1 year after a settlement has been made with Egypt, and that, if the country were then tranquil, we might withdraw the troops to Abbassia (4 miles outside Cairo) and Mustapha Barracksf (a suburb of Alexandria), disposing our remaining troops in the triangle Port Said Zag-a-zig - Suez.4. At the same meeting Lord Allenby stated that he considered it essential that troops should be kept in Cairo and in Alexandria, but that, if after a year or two the situation improved, Lord Curzohs suggestion might be adopted.* At present the following units o  this garrison are at Constantinople : 2 Pack batteries, 17th Brigade Royal Field Artillery (less 1 battery) ; 2 battalions ; 1 squadron Royal Air Force.t This would only mean withdrawing small detachments and guards, as the battalions are already located in Mustapha Barracks and in huts close to them.(.B23/75)   110  2/2:)   W.O.P.  0&apos;JO01431975
5. Since then no serious trouble has occurred in Egypt, and the situation may be considered as fairly satisfactory, but the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, is emphatic as to the necessity of maintaining garrisons actually in Cako and in the suburbs of Alexandria. It is in these two places that internal disturbances, should they occur, will commence ; troops are required in Cairo as a safeguard for the High Commissioner and for the foreign population ; the Royal Air Force stations in Cairo and Alexandria and the Imperial Wireless Station at Abu Zabal (about 12 miles north of Cairo) must have the protection of troops. The importance of Cairo is enhanced by the fact that it is the head of the Fresh Water Canal, on which any troops operating in the Canal Zone must rely for water.The General Staff are in general agreement with these views of the General Officer Commanding, Egypt.6. The location of the troops in Egypt is further affected by the possible action of the French. We have already received a hint that the French Government intend to object to the existence of any British Garrison in ike Canal Zone, as being a breach of Article VIII of the Convention of 1888, a copy of which is attached as Appendix B. It is believed that this Contention on the part Of the French is being used as a lever to obtain our favourable consideration of their own claims in respect of Tangier, and the Foreign Office do not consider that the French have a good caste. In any case, the General Staff do not consider the permanent location of troops in the Canal zone a military necessity, and, in fact, the only unit so placed at present is one platoon at Port Said, which is retained there at the request of the High Commissioner.7. The present intention is that the garrison shall be retained at its existing strength after the &quot; Treaty &quot; has been negotiated, and that, subject to the foregoing considerations, it shall be distributed between Cairo and Abbassia, Helmieh, Moascar and Alexandria. Moascar has been selected in preference to Zag-a-zig  Or Tel-el-Kebir, which were suggested, because it is convenient for the despatch of troops to Port Said or Suez, and lack of the amenities of life would be less felt there than at the latter two places.8. The actual accommodation of the troops presents considerable difficulty. There are in Egypt permanent barracks for-1 cavalry regiment.4 infantry battalions (excluding Kasf-el-Nil). 1 brigade, Royal Horse Artillery. Certain ancillary services.Whereas the garrison will consist of 3 cavalry regiments.6 infantry battalions.3 brigades, Royal Artillery;Certain ancillary services.9. At present the garrison is accommodated as follows : 1 cavalry regiment in cavalry barracks       ...      ... ...   ibbassia.1 cavalry regiment in main barracks (infantry)      ... ...   Abbassia (temp.).1 cavalry regiment in hutted carfip :.t      ... ...   Helmieh.1 brigade, Royal Horse Artillery, in barracks       ..; Abbassia.1 brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery (pack), in hutted camp...   Helmieh. 1 brigade, Royal Field Artillery, in tents   a. Moascar.1 infantry battalion in barracks      ...      .vs      ... ...   Alexandria.1 infantry battalion in Abbas Hilffii Barracks       ... .;.   Abbassia.. 1 infimuy battalion in Citadel Barracks    t.s ...   Cairo.1 infantry battalion in huts .u      .,:      ..; ...   Alexandria.1 infantry battalion in tents vi.      .h .:. Mbascar.1 infantry battalion in Kasf-el-Nil BarrsiG&apos;ks        ;.. Cairo.*Wifeless company and medical stores in Red Barracks ...   Abbassia.10. Under the old conditions the Egyptian&apos; Govefntrierit recognized in principle an obligation to place at our disposal available barrack accommodation for&apos; the garrison. lit pursuance of this principle&apos;, shortly before the war they provided about  400,000 for the erection of the Abbas Hilffii Barracks at Abbassia,for our;use, on a promise by us thereiipdn to vacate Kasr-ei-Nil. The Abbas Hiimi Barracks have been erected and occupied by us, but we have not vacated Kasr-el-Nil.* Lent to us temporarily by the Egyptian Government (see paragraph 10).
Similarly, we occupied during the war the Red Barracks, Abbassia, which are the -property of the Egyptian Government, and are how occupied by the Wireless Company and by the Base Medical Stores. The Egyptian . Government wish us to vacate them in March, 1923, which does not appear to be feasible.It is quite clear that under present conditions We cannot suggest that the Egyptian Government should find barracks, in cash of kind, for the troops now in that country in excess of the 1914&apos; garrison. :&quot;-:;va11. The existing hutted and tented camps are not suitable for further prolonged occupation and must be replaced. Ii is not proposed to Sheet permanent barracks, but there is a choice of two.types of temporary&apos; hutments, differing considerably in cost, and the decision turns upon the period for which the accommodation is likely to be required. One type, lasting only for 3 to 4 years, could be provided at a considerably less cost than the other type, which would last from 15 to 20 years. Oh the Other hand, to provide the cheaper type now, and have to replace it 4 years hence, would hoi be economical.To provide accommodation of the i years&apos; type for all.the troops in question would cost  144,000, a considerable quantity of huts being available. To provide the 20 years&apos; type for all would cost  420,000.Unless a more definite decision as to the future strength of the garrison can be given at once, it is proposed to assume that within A years conditions will admit of some reduction, but not reduction to the level of 1914, and accordingly to,provide only the 4 years&apos; type at Moascar and the more durable type elsewhere; The cost of this is roughly estimated at  310,000.It is not proposed to make any provision hi 1923-24 for replacing Kasr-el-Ml in Cairo or the Red Barracks in Alexandria, though there may be some difficulty with the Egyptian Government about the delay in evacuation.
