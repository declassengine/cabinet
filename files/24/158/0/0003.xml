[This Document is the Property of His Britanriic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1923.SECRET.CP. 3 (23).CABINET.IMPERIAL INSTITUTE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Imperial Institute (Management) Act of 1916 transferred the control of the Institute from the Board of Trade to the Colonial Office, and established an Executive Council &quot; for the purpose of carrying on the management of the Imperial Institute under the control of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.&quot; This Council consists of the Dominion High Commissioners, representatives of India and of various Home Departments of State, and of fourteen persons nominated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.   Its composition is regulated by the schedule to the Act.The work of the Institute includes the supply of technical information and the maintenance of laboratories for investigation of raw materials. There is also an exhibition of Dominion and Colonial produce. I fear that there is some overlapping with other institutions notably the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau.The annual expenditure is a little under , 40,000 a year, of which by far the great part goes in salaries and wages. I understand that the present staff is regarded as insufficient to carry on the work on present lines.In 1910, when the Institute was practically bankrupt, a bargain was made between Lord Milner and Mr. Chamberlain that an appeal should be made to the Overseas Governments to join us in providing an assured income of , 40,000 a year for the Institute for five years. If they would provide  30,000 a year between them, His Majesty&apos;s Government would provide  10,000. This amount has since been voted by Parliament.It was one of the terms of the bargain that the Institute should be wound up if the Overseas Governments did not attach sufficient importance to its continued existence to contribute this total amount, and they were made aware of the con-sequences of a refusal. $In reply to this appeal Canada gave $20,000 a year. Australia and New Zealand gave  2,000 and  1,000 respectively. India, South Africa and Newfoundland were unable to increase their contributions of  1,400,  250 and  200 respectively. The  30,000 was made up for one year, the Colonies and Protectorates providing the bulk of the money.India has withdrawn her contribution as from the end of the present financial year. Australia has just refused to contribute any longer. Canada will, I understand, shortly do the same. The truth is that most of the Dominions and India have their own institutions, of a similar character, and naturally prefer to spend their money on them.The Colonies and Protectorates are overstraining their resources to contribute unduly large sums to this Home institution. Some of them are actually paying their contributions out of borrowed money. I cannot ask them to continue to contribute anything like the present amounts in view of the financial difficulties in which they are nearly all involved.The refusal of Australia to contribute any longer, coupled with the withdrawal of Canada and India and the reduction of Colonial contributions, makes it clear that the amount required from Overseas to justify the Imperial grant cannot be hoped for. The crisis contemplated in 1920 has arisen.It is obvious to me that the Imperial Institute must either be wound up or profoundly modified.    It cannot go on upon present lines, and, in view of the[9317]
approaching Economic Conference, an early decision on the future of its work is desirable. I believe that some parts at least of the work now done at the Institute could usefully be continued, but 1 am not yet clear how far a transfer of certain functions to other institutions is advisable. I have therefore decided to appoint a Committee, under the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, to examine the situation and report what functions at present carried on by the Institute are essential, and whether these should be continued by the Institute or attached elsewhere, and what consequential legislation or other measures will be necessary to carry these recommendations into effect.It is clear, for instance, that the Act of 1916 will have to be modified, and that legislation will be necessary in regard to the endowments of the Institute.It is also clear that provision must be made for carrying on any work which is really necessary in the interests of British trade or of the Colonies. 1 his will involve a detailed examination of the work done by the Institute. An opportunity may be afforded of effecting some economy by the amalgamation of overlapping institutions.I am calling together the Executive Council and am explaining the position to them, and the Committee will then get to work immediately.DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office, January 5, 1923.
