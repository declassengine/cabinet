0[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government;]Printed for the Cabinet.      January 1923.SECRET.CP. 13 (23).Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee. Conclusion No. 27.I invite the attention of my colleagues to Conclusion No. 27 of the Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee, circulated as CP. No. 4310.The question involved is the granting to Indians of Commissions in the Indian Army and the consequent process of Indianisation in the Indian Army.The Government of India have submitted an alternative proposal, upon which the decision of the Cabinet is required.The following is a history of the matter up to the present time.1. On the 20th August 1917 the Secretary of State for India made the following-announcement in the House of Commons : &quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with which the Government of India are in. complete accord is that of increasing the association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible Government in India as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possiblo .... I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by successive stages. The British Government and the Government of India, on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples, must be judges of the time and measure of each advance, and they must be guided by the co operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus be conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of responsibility.&quot;In commenting npon this announcement the following extracts from the Montagu-Chelmsford Report are relevant: &apos;&quot; In the next place we may discern an ever-growing discontent with measures which were resented as evidence of racial discrimination .... There was the exclusion of Indians from the commissioned ranks of the Army. Indian officers form a separate establishment from the British officers, and the highest and most experienced ol the former rank lower than the most junior of the latter. This particular disparity naturally came into special prominence on the outbreak of the war.&quot;&quot; There remains one item the importance of which in the eyes of India outweighs all others. British commissions have for the first time been granted to Indian officers .... The services of the Indian Army in the war and the great increase in its numbers make it necessary that a considerable number of commissions should now be given.&quot;2. As an earnest of their good faith Government decided to allocate 10 vacancies at Sandhurst each year for Indians. In addition, arrangements were made during the war to grant commissions, as a special measure, to a few selected Iudiaus who were actually serving as Indian officers or non-commissioned officers and who had gone through a course of instruction at a military school in India.3. On 28th March 1921 members of the Legislative Assembly, commenting on the adequacy of these arrangements, drew attention to the fact that in the past two years a total of 25 cadetships only had been awarded, and that, having regard to the declaration of August 1917 and the pronouncements made by His Most Gracious Majesty the King, the right of Indians to higher ranks in the Army should be recognised in a spirit of justice and liberality. It was further pointed out that many Indians dream of the clay when the Army will be thoroughly Indianised as other departments are being Indianised.6016     100  1.23
As a result of this debate, the following resolution was passed by the Legislative Assembly: &quot; That the King-Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all arms of His Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval and Air Forces id India, and the Ancillary Services and the Auxiliary Forces. That every encouragement should be given to Indians, including the educated middle classes, subject to the prescribed standard of fitness, to enter the commissioned ranks of the Army, and that in nominating candidates for the entrance examination unofficial Indians should be associated with the nominating authority ; and in granting King&apos;s commissions, after giving full regard to the claims to promotion of officers of the Indian Army who already hold the&apos; commissions of His Excellency the Viceroy, the rest of the commissions granted should be given to cadets trained at Sandhurst. The general rule in selecting candidates for this training should be from the communities which furnish recruits, and as far as possible in proportion to the numbers in which they furnish such recruits.:&apos;&quot; That not less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every year should be grauted to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot; This resolution was accepted by the Government of India.4. Immediately following on this resolution two further resolutions were passed dealing with the methods by which the Indianisation of the Army should be put into effect.These resolutions read as follows : *&quot; That adequate facilities should be provided in India for the preliminary training of Indians to lit them to enter the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.&quot;&quot; That as soon as funds be available steps should he taken to establish in India a military college such as Sandhurst, and the desirability of establishing in India training and educational institutions for other branches of the Army should be steadily kept iu view.&quot; 5. Apart from the principle of Indianisation and the methods by which it should be introduced, the Legislative Assembly passed a further resolution in relation to the scale of pay of Indian commissioned officers to the following effect: &quot; This Assembly recommends to the Governor-General in Council that in the interests of economy, and in view of the likelihood of the growth of the Indian element in the commissioned rank, it is essential that before vested interests arise the pay of all commissioned ranks in all branches of the Army should be fixed on an Indian basis, with an overseas allowance, in the case of British officers, and with a similar allowance for Indian officers holding the King&apos;s commission when serving overseas.&quot;II. The demand for Indianisdtion culminates in tlie Recommendations of the Military Requirements Committee assembled under the Presidency of Lord Raidinson.The above expressions of Indian opinion regarding the Indianisation of the Indian Army are reiterated in a definite form and in greater detail in the Report of the Military Requirements Committee (19th July 1921), which sat in India, with His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief as President. This Committee, whose recorm mendations were unanimous, declared &quot; that responsibility for defence is the natural corollary of self government,&quot; and recommended publication of a definite policy of gradual Indianisation as a means of removing the existing feeling of resentment and of reorganising Indian nationhood. The Committee added that the realisation that India is to have a greater and increasing share in the responsibility for her own defence will enable the taxpayer to shoulder the burden of high military expenditure more cheerfully and willingly.HI. The Committee Recommendations summarised.Summarised, the proposals may briefly be stated to be as follows : ,.(a) An announcement of policy in respect of the Indianisation of the Army to be made at an early date.* ST.B. This lias been dune.
(b) That responsibility for defence being accepted as the natural corollary ofself-government, a policy should be adopted which will render India more and more self-supporting in matters of defence, i.e., as far as officers are concerned, the gradual elimination of the British element and the sub-stitution of Indians.(c) With this object in view Indians to be freely admitted to commissions in all branches of the Indian Army at once, the number of such commissions granted in the first instance being at least 25 per cent, of the total, number of commissions granted each year, and increasing by 2\ per cent, per annum.That the field of selection should be widened with a view to the inclusion of the professional and middle classes.(d) For the time being these candidates to go through a course at Sandhurstprior to obtaining a commission.(e) An Indian Military College to be started as soon as funds are available,a course at this institution being considered the equivalent of a course at the Royal Military College.Meanwhile, before these recommendations had been received at the India Office, a scheme for the formation of a &quot; Dominion&quot; Army had been prepared by the Military Department, India Office.This scheme was framed to give Indians the opportunity of showing that they were both willing and capable of making efficient officers.   It recommended : (1) It should be announced immediately that Government has decided upon the formation of the nucleus of a Dominion force for India with a view to fulfilling the promises made by the Government and in order to enable Indians to prepare for the day when, having attained Dominion status, India will assume full responsibility for her own defence.(2) That the guiding principle in the formation of such a force should be that the present Indian Army is to be a gradually diminishing force in proportion as the Dominion Army is a gradually increasing force.(3) That in the first instance the establishment of. one complete military formation, such as a brigade of all arms with ancillary services, be aimed at. That the progressive increase in number of the Dominion force units and corresponding decrease in the Crown forces in India shall be considered in relation to the number of the Dominion units proved to have attained a degree of efficiency which will admit of their substitution in place of units of the Crown forces, and not depend merely upon the number of Indian aspirants to commissions.It is recognised that this brigade would have to be surplus to the minimum military requirements of India, and would consequently be an additional charge on the Budget.(4) That the Dominion force should be formed unit by unit by raising new Dominion units from the many demobilised soldiers now in India and voluntary transfers from regular Indian units ; a corresponding decrease taking place in the regular Indian units as each Dominion unit is proved efficient to replace them or when the military authorities in India consider that the military situation admits.(5) That, in order to ensure a proper test of efficiency, Dominion units should be permanently embodied, should be associated with Imperial units in training manoeuvres, &amp;c, and finally do a tour of duty on the frontier as far as possible under service conditions.(6) These tentative Dominion forces to be under the command of the Military Authorities of the time.(7) That officers for the Dominion units should be obtained as follows: (a) british officers (a gradually decreasing element).   As volunteers secondedfrom the Imperial to the Dominion Army.(b) indian officers (a gradually increasing element)  (I) From amongst those Indians already holding King&apos;s commissions as volunteers.(2) From selected Indian officers now holding Viceroy&apos;s commissions (as siibadars, &amp;c.) in the Indian Army as volunteers.(3) From future graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, until an Indian Military College is established.(4) Finally, from graduates of the Indian Military College when established.
i The Government of India rejected this scheme on the grounds that it would establish a formation surplus to minimum military requirements, and stated that Indian,public opinion would not accept a scheme such as that proposed as an adequate earnest of our intention to Indianise the Army.IV. The Government of India Proposals.On 1st September 1921 -the Government of India forwarded proposals for the grant of commissions to Indians in the Royal Air Force and as Artillery and Engineer officers for service in India by the grant of five cadetships per annum at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and also for increase in the number of cadetships at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.Their view was that the combined total of commissions in the Air Force, Indian Artillery, Indian Engineers and Indian Infantry should be counted against the 25 per cent, which the Legislative Assembly asked should be reserved for Indians.On 19th. January .1922, however, the Government of India forwarded the proceedings of a Committee appointed by His Excellency the Oommauder-in-Chief in India to frame a scheme for the Indianisation of the Indian Army. This scheme was considered by the Government of India, who, though not prepared to recommend wholesale adoption of the scheme, stated that they considered it offered hope as a basis for Indianisation.By this scheme the whole Indian Army was to be Indianised in -12 years, in three periods of 14 years, as follows :  First period.   Second period.   Third period.403 I^ [ Remainder of1-. j    the Armv.1  )In addition to the above,-, ancillaiy services were to be Indianised proportionately.This scheme was to be accelerated by altering the second period to nine years and third period to seven years, if the first period proves the success of the experiment; in this manner the whole Indian Army would be Indianised in 30 years.Commenting on the report, the Viceroy in Council stated that although expert military opinion has fixed 30 years as a minimum period within which completion of Indianisation could be attained, they contemplated the possibility and indeed probability of a curtailment of 30 years if the experiment proved successful.V. Conference of Ministers do not sanction Government of India&apos;&apos;s proposals.The. Government of India&apos;s scheme for Indianisation was discussed by a Con-ference of Ministers of the late Government with the result that on 14th February 1922 a telegram was sent to the Government of India by the late Secretary of State, of which the following is an extract: 675.&quot; 2. We regret further that although we seek some better method of giving Indians an opportunity of serving as officers, we cannot sanction your proposal of Indianisation. We find it difficult, if not impossible, to harmonise your recom-mendations with your Army Department telegram No. 22 of 7th January, which suggested that you could only rely upon loyalty of your Indian troops if the present proportion of British officers were maintained. We have already experienced the greatest difficulty in getting suitable cadets for Sandhurst, and we cannot see any justification for a belief that the large numbers of suitable officers which you foreshadow in your scheme will be forthcoming. The Indian Army has a traditional reputation for reliability and efficiency. We are not prepared to risk the sacrifice of this reputation unless we have an alternative which has been tried and upon which we can rely.   We would not entertain the same objection to any scheme which wouldCavalry regiments        - - 7Infantry battalions       - - 20Pioneer battalions        - - 3Pack batteries   -        - - 6Headquarters Company, .R.E. - 1Field Companies, S. and M. - 6Field Troops     -        - 2Railway7 Company, S. and M. - army Troops Company, S. and M. 1
take the form of selecting a few battalions, say four, in different parts of India, for the purpose oi trying an experiment by the success of which we could judge the possibility of further extension by way of gradually replacing the British officers by Indians, the latter, it may be, to be educated at an Indian Sandhurst, as proposed by Lord Minto&apos;s Government. This is not open to the same criticisms as the definite programme you propose.   Please let me have your views.&quot;To which the Government of India replied : -VI. Further Discussions.202.&quot; 2. Secondly, as regards our programme of Indianisation. we would point out that such measure is an accepted corollary of the declaration of 1917, the joint report of the Constitutional Reforms having emphasised as far back as 1918 the necessity of giving practical effect to a policy which we had hitherto only accepted in principle. We find ourselves, therefore, entirely unable either to comprehend or subscribe to the position that the acceptance of a practical pro-gramme which has been prepared by our own military advisers can be interpreted as implying a concession to a suggested policy of retreat from India. It is, in our opinion, no more capable of being quoted as a proof, of adhesion to such a policy than the acceptance of the Reforms Scheme itself.&quot;&quot;7. As regards Indianisation of officers of Indian Army we must definitely ask to be relieved of the obligation of making to the Legislature an announcement so damaging to ourselves, and so inconsistent with our previous declarations as that embodied in the suggestion that an experiment should be made with four battalions only. We accepted last March a recommendation of the Assembly, that 25 per cent, of future recruits for the Indian Army should be Indians. The Indianisation of the Army is to Indians the crucial test of our sincerity in the policy of encouragement of India to advance towards the goal of self-government. To make now an announcement of so restricted a scope would inevitably carry to the most moderate Indians the conviction that His Majesty&apos;s Government no longer desires to give practical effect to that policy. We, therefore, request permission to announce that both His Majesty&apos;s Government and ourselves have decided to make a definite start with Indianisation scheme, but that exact number of units has not yet been agreed on, and is the subject -of discussion between us and the Home Government. We would stipulate, however, on our own part that the announcement, if made, should be without prejudice to our pressing for the adoption of the larger scheme which we have already recommended.&quot;-s * s w * *The late Secretary of State in reply telegraphed on 22nd February 1922 : 807. &quot;As regards Inclianisation, I trust that you will understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to assist Indians to defend their own country, and to offer Indians employment in all ranks of the Army. The difference between us is this, that we are not prepared to commit ourselves to a particular programme of Indianisation until we have proved that there is a supply of efficient and loyal Indian officers who can be employed with confidence, who will respond to emergency and fulfil the vital responsibilities which will be entrusted to them. We are prepared to sanction experiments and to abide by their results, but any further Indianisation must depend on their success, and can only be contemplated, if they are successful. We have, tried offering cadetships at Sandhurst to Indians. We are willing to embark on. the f urtlier experiment of endeavouring gradually to officer with Indian officers selected battalions. We are willing to consider any proposal you may make for training these officers in India rather than at Sandhurst. Even though your own Committee doubt whether the proposal will be popular, we are prepared to experiment, by giving commissions to existing Indian officers who can pass the necessary tests and undergo the necessary training. If the four battalions which I have tentatively suggested can be demonstrated to be insufficient to give you a good guidance, we are
prepared to reconsider the actual number, but without experience and in the dark,, and without knowledge whether officers of the stamp required are available we are not prepared to contemplate any further application of the experiment that is absolutely necessary to give it a fair chance, for we cannot afford in present circumstances and in the present condition of India to jeopardise the efficiency of the Indian Army or to be forced into giving commissions to Indians because they are Indians.&quot;&quot; We are convinced that it is just as wrong in the interests of Indian development to give to inefficient Indians opportunities the results of the use of which will discredit their country, as it is to deny to efficient Indians the opportunity of serving their country with credit.&quot;VII. Recommendation of the Indian Military Requirements Committee.... The final recommendation of the Indian Military Requirements Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was as follows : (a) We are unable to approve the latest scheme of the Government of India. The most that we can recommend is that an experiment should be made by selecting four units of cavalry or infantry to be officered by Indians ; and no promise should be made of further Jndianisation unless and until that experiment has proved successful.(6) We concur in the proposal of the Government of India that a military college should be established in India for the training of Indian cadets destined for service in the Indian Army, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of ithe experiment of admitting Indian cadets to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, without previous training.VIII. Revised Proposals of the Government of India.In view of the telegram of 22nd February quoted above, the Government of India on 3rd August 1922 sent a revised scheme for the Indianisatiou of the Indian Army.Their recommendations Were as follows : (a) To Indianise eight units (commencing at once) by posting one Indian per unit yearly for the next four years.(&amp;) Although, eight units only are to be Indianised at once the Government of India consider this should not prevent suitable Indian candidates for corn-missions being accepted up to 25 per cent, of the annual intake.(c) That an announcement should be made to the effect that the decision toIndianise eight units immediately is merely the first instalment of a progressive scheme aiming ultimately at complete Indianisation,(d) The Government of India propose immediately to consider various outstanding-questions (chiefly concerning the pay of future Indian officers) and when a satisfactory conclusion has been arrived at, to ask the Secretary of State to reconsider their views regarding the announcement of the &quot; larger&quot; scheme  by which is presumably meant the scheme formulated in the Committee appointed by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India which has failed to receive the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Government of India consider that a proposal to limit the initial stage to * four, units only would be regarded as disingenuous and humiliating to Indian public opinion. Moreover,, it is considered that less than eight units would be insufficient to secure a really reliable test, while the numbers of cadets being trained at Sandhurst are just sufficient to provide for eight units.IX. Proposed Amendments to Indian Military Requirements Report.I am of opinion that the following alterations should be made in the Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee.
:After para. 137 insert following paragraph : - . .&quot; Moreover, while we recognise that the possession of an army Of her own will be the necessary corollary of the attainment by India of complete Dominion status, and that in the meantime the development of such an array should as far as possible.de be encouraged by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it does not, in pur opinion, necessarily follow that the future Dominion army will be merely the existing army Indianised. It is too early yet to predict upon what line of &apos;. experiment success will follow, and probably many lines will be tried and will fail. But we agree that experiment should be made at once with Indianisation on a scale sufficiently large to give it a fair opportunity of justifying itself.&quot;Then in para. 133 omit the first sentence, and in the second read :-&quot; We accordingly recommend that an experiment be made by selecting eight units of cavalry or infantry to be officered by Indians, but that no promise should be made,&quot; &amp;c..1,1th January 1923.PEEL.
