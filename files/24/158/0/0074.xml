CABINET. &quot;   13SPECIAL KEPOKT ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 84.    Period ended January 26, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 22nd January was 1,438,841, a decrease of 19,851 on the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The position in the Midlands remains normal, and activity in the Yorkshire and Durham coalfields is increasing. Employment is now good at all the main centres in Lancashire, and the general tendency is towards further improvement. The position in the Welsh coalfields has improved, but stoppages have occurred at some collieries owing to transport difficulties. The position in Scotland is one of steadiness, but there is still a certain amount of unemployment in almost all districts. Depression continues in the Somerset coalfields, but a slight recovery has occurred in the Forest of Dean.IRON AND STEEL.Continued improvement is reported from Yorkshire and the North of England, and there are indications of an early increase of activity in Wales. In Scotland, however, the position is still unsatisfactory, and no immediate improvement is regarded as likely. While there has been no appreciable change in the Midlands, the tendency appears to be towards improvement.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.There has been a further improvement on the Tyne and Tees, and activity has increased on the Mersey. At Barrow, however, progress is slow. An early increase in employment is expected on the Clyde, several orders having been received: the trade dispute referred to in the previous report has been settled. Activity in Wales continues to be limited. Employment in the South-Western Counties has slightly increased, mainly in connection with ship-repairing work, but depression still obtains in the industry as a whole.ENGINEERING.The general position is still one of severe depression^ but quiet improvement is taking place in many districts. Employment is still increasing in the motor section, and the position in the textile machinery section is on the whole fairly good, though orders are being worked off more quickly than new orders arrive.TEXTILES.Cotton. There has been no appreciable change in the employment position in Lancashire, but the prospects are regarded as a little more hopeful. It has been decided that no further organised short time is to be worked. There are no signs of any general improvement in this industry in Yorkshire.
Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. The position in the West Riding is practically stationary, and there is no indication of early improvement. Employment in the hosiery trade remains good in the Midlands, but in Scotland, whilst there is little unemployment, slightly reduced hours are now being worked.Silk. Trade is quiet at Leek, where.much short time is being worked, but at Derby employment in artificial silk manufacture is good.Lace. In the Midlands, unemployment continues severe, but there is some activity in the curtain section.Jute. Many orders are being placed in the jute industry, particularly at Dundee, but it is not anticipated that additional workpeople will be required.BUILDING.Slightly increased activity is reported from some places, but on the whole there has been practically no change in the position. There is no doubt that while the negotiations now proceeding in regard to wages and hours are unsettled, new work vail be held in suspense.BOOT AND SHOE.An improvement is reported from nearly all the main centres in the Midlands, but employment is still on the whole considerably below normal. The position in the London area has not materially changed, and at Norwich trade remains very quiet.   Depression continues in Scotland.ICLOTHING.While depression still prevails on the whole, there are reports of increased activity from some districts, and in particular from the London area and the South-West Counties.POTTERY AND GLASS.There has been a slight increase in employment in the pottery industry, but as stated in the previous report, no substantial improvement is expected until the. spring.   An improvement has taken place in the plate and sheet glass and glass bottle trades at St. Helens; the glass bottle trade at Earlestown and Castleford is, however, very quiet.TINPLATE.Employment in this industry continues to be good.TRANSPORT.Unemployment at the ports on the North-East Coast has not appreciably decreased, but an immediate improvement is expected, particularly at Hull and Middlesbrough in connection with shipments of coal to the continent. There is a steady improvement in the position at Liverpool, but activity declined at Avonmouth. There is no change to report as regards the general position at the London Docks and in Scotland.C. A.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.
(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &apos;&apos; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.*Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 20th January. 1923. 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from, autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 128,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of [0465] b 3
Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes, assisted last year. AH applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown, below (see table 6). County Councils were also circulated with. regard; to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars,, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities.on;the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications may be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes. The time for receiving applications has been further extended provisionally to the 10th February, 1923.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Eural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 30th November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government will be continued&apos; and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below : Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... Land Drainage Afforestation ...Acceleration of Government contracts Office of&apos;Works    ...        ...... 375,000General Post Office ...        ... 946,000-     1,321,000. It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would&apos; be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would- involve an expenditure of about&apos;  3;000;000; Half of&apos;it from the Road Fund.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty, would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total Of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would put in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations. 600,000 170,000 100,000
On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants are now available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants&apos; made last winter. The sum of  100,000 referred to above is to be used partly for this purpose and partly for the purpose of relief schemes in Crown Forests and for additional work in the Commission^ forests by the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the loth December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which may be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT JANUARY 20, 1923, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.
