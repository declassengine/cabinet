THIS DOCUMENT,. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRTTANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVEKMJENT.^ ?iC A D I N E T,SECRBT 0,P.75(23).\Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.1 THE ROAD FUND.Road Expenditure and Taxation of MechanicallyPropelled Vehicles.1ii&apos;1*is I,UI have read the Memorandum CP. 44 (23) circulated by the. Financial Secretary to the Treasury on this subject, and dated the 25th January, 1923.The Cabinet will wish clearly to understand that the various programmes of work, which I have recently suggested to the Unemployment Committee, have been put forward with the sole object of assisting in the relief of unemployment in a practical manner.     This policy initiated by the late, has been continued by the present, Government,    It is in compliance with this policy    E that I have formulated programmes of important road works which        I could be put in hand out of the resources of the Road -Fund; if the   I Government were willing to pledge that Fund for some years ahead. The policy of the Treasury in the past has also been to insist that the resources of the Road Fund should be utilised to the uttermost for this purpose, as a means of avoiding demands upon the Exchequer, and by this means the Exchequer has been able to limit its grants to sums amounting in all to approximately  .  1,500,000 in respect of the Road Fund (Unemployment) programmes which Involve an approved expenditure of about  24,000,000,     My understanding has   been that, while the Road Fund was to continue to give assistance to as many schemes as possible, no contributions from the Exchequer were to be looked for.   This position 1 have accepted in order to assist the Chancellor of the Exchequer and not, as the Memorandum appears to suggest, in order to commit the Road Fund for several years ahead to the construction of optional works to the satisfaction of &quot;road enthusiasts&quot;, and I regret that any such suggestion should have been imported into J:he
discues ion,      The argument of the Memorandum ignores the transformation in traffic conditions and the rapid growth in the number of motor vehicles, which, while it yields an expanding revenue, adds to the burden of highway expenditure. Naturally I should, greatly prefer that the resources of the Road Fund should not be mortgaged, even to the extent which the Unemployment Committee has approved, but it must be realised that the alternative is to find direct out of the Engineer, substantial sums for road works, which are the main means of providing Immediate employment for unskilled labour, unless the Government is going to abandon its principle of providing work in preference to doles.Without entering Into the historical arguments for a system of assigned revenues as applied to roads, I would point out that the Financial secretary&apos;s reduotio   ad absurdum Is based on an incomplete analogy.To break away from the principle that the users of the road should contribute directly tc their maintenance and development, might have a far reaching effect,     So long ae the whole of the proceeds of the motor taxation are devoted to the roads, I submit that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in a materially stronger position for maintaining that no other moneys can be contributed to roads out of national funds.Without entering Into the question of pledges, I -would point out that if it were desired to give effect to proposals on the lines indicated in the&apos; Memorandum,, amendments of the existing Roads Act, 1920, and&apos;PIn&amp;nce Acts would be necessary. In opposition to any such amendments which must be directed to the reduction of the contribution to road expenditure would be united the motoring interests and the representatives of all Highv/ay Authorities.Finally, vhile I do not wish to prejudge the question of an allocation of a larger proportion of the Road Fund to
rural areas, it requires to be carefully considered how far we should be justified in departing from the existing general principle of administration of the Fund, under which its resources are distributed according to the relative importance of the various roads as channels of communication, and not according to the financial exigencies of the different authorities whose areas they traverse,(SIGRED)     WILFRID ASHLEY.I approve. &apos; (Intd.)    J.B.Ministry of Transport.2nd February. 1923. &apos;
