AIR POLICY AND A ONE-POWER AIR STANDARD.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN the latter days of the Coalition Government the question of our Air Defences was projected vividly into the public eye. To the Cabinet, the House of Commons and the Press alike, the air menace seemed so overwhelming as to necessitate an immediate increase in the Royal Air Force. It was accordingly decided that between 1922 and 1925 fifteen additional Regular Squadrons and live Auxiliary Squadrons should be formed for Home Defence at a rough estimate of  2,000,000 per annum. When I assumed office I found that, whilst the preliminary steps in this programme had already been initiated, no heavy commitments had yet been undertaken. After a careful scrutiny of the scheme, I came to the conclusion that the formation of the fifteen Regular Squadrons should proceed, &quot;but that the question of the five Auxiliary Squadrons might be postponed pending the further consideration of the Cabinet. I was authorised by the Prime Minister to make a statement to this effect in the House of Commons on December 14th, 1922.I am now anxious, in view of these decisions, to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the relative position of the Royal Air Force, estimated in terms of machines, in face of the greatest European Air Power, France, and to make certain general observations upon our air policy.In the following tables I make a comparison now and in 1925, when the British and French programmes of expansion will presumably have been completed.(&apos;)Lest I should seem to be&apos;conjuring up a fantastic and morbid comparison, I preface these tables with the following extract from Lord Balfour&apos;s summary of the situation (OLD. Paper No. 108a) : The only country which can seriously menace us is France. A. war with. France would be a world calamity, which seems almost unthinkable; but where national security is concerned even the unthinkable must be faced, and we must sometimes assume that to be possible which, in existing circum-stances, seems only an evil dream. &quot;(2)Table 1.Present Distribution and Relative Strengths of British and French A ir Forces.(1.)

To supplement these tables of military strength, I add the following: statistics with reference to Civil Aviation. For, though its direct value for military purposes is at present small, (&quot;) indirectly Civil Aviation should be of assistance in supporting the aircraft industry and thereby making sudden expansion possible in time of war. 1 As things are, the maintenance of the British aircraft industry is one of the most, difficult problems with which I am faced. Tables 5 and 6 show clearly to what relatively small dimensions it has dwindled.

Moreover, it should be noted that the French Government and the Chamber of Deputies, if we may judge from the trend of recent debates, seem determined to push on in every possible way their programme of military and civil expansion.What, then, should be our attitude in face of this great disparity in military and civil machines? Should the Cabinet rest content with the programme of the fifteen additional squadrons to which they have already agreed ? Is there any standard which we ought to adopt for the strength of the Royal Air Force ?It is to these questions that I wish to draw the Cabinefs urgent attention.In order that they should realise the dimensions of the problem, I begin with the last of the three.Is it possible to decide upon&apos;the strength of the Royal Air Force by applying some such standard of strength as in the past we have used in estimating our naval requirements ?I will assume that on the naval analogy we adopt a One-Power Air Standard against France.(4) Vide Appendix II. The Military value of Civil Aviation.(6) In July last the Society of British Aircraft Constructors asked for orders to the Value of  10,000,000 to be placed over a period of three years, and stated that this was the minimum which would enable aircraft manufacturing- firms to keep alive. Actually, it has not been possible to place orders with these firms for more than  1,800,000 in 1922, approximately 40 per cent, of which will not be payable until after the commencement of next financial year.(6) The total provision made in Air Estimates for 1922-23 for Civil Aviation (excluding Meteorology) is approximately  335,000; the corresponding French figure is approximately 100,000,000 fr.(!) These figures are estimates.[9479] B 2
In order that the Cabinet should be able to form a judgment on the practicability of this policy, I estimate the cost of a One-Power Standard now and in 1925, when our respective programmes will have been carried out, as follows :-The first of the preceding Tables shows that, whilst we have at present 371 effective machines on the strength of our 32 service squadrons, the French have 1,178 i If the Royal Air Force were to be increased to the French machine standard of to-day, 53 new British squadrons, in addition to the 17 already authorised, would have to be formed. These .70 additional squadrons would bring the Royal Air Force to a total strength of 102 squadrons mustering 1,177 machines.Of these 70 squadrons, not less than 14 would be so organised as to be available for co-operation with the Navy and Army in such proportions as might be decided after consultation with the Admiralty and War Office. The remaining 56 would be constituted as Home Defence squadrons. On the assumption that flying training would be carried out entirely in them, and not at separate flying schools, and that no increase would be made in respect of expenditure on research or civil aviation, I estimate that the annual cost to the Imperial Exchequer of a force of these dimen-sions with the necessary , ancillary establishments would be approximately- 23,000,000 per annum. (s) This estimate represents an increase of about 53 per cent, on the present cost of the Royal Air Force. It excludes all capital charges, e.g., for the initial cost of raising and equipping the new squadrons and providing the necessary aerodromes and buildings. I estimate that these capital charges would amount to approximately  15,500,000.This is a formidable sum. It would, however, under peace conditions take several years to form the 70 new squadrons, and during the period of their formation, more particularly the first three years, only a proportion of the full amount of  23,000,000 would be required. I am, therefore, of opinion that if the Cabinet were to decide to expand the Royal Air Force on this scale, and the Air Estimates were forth-with raised to  23,000,000, the capital outlay could be spread over the whole period of expansion and the total increase of cost limited to about  8,000,000 a year over the  15,000,000 that we are now spending.(9)So much for the comparison of the cost of a One-Power Standard at the present time. I now pass to a comparison of the 1925 strength, when, if no change is made in our present respective programmes, the Royal Air Force will have 575 machines and the French force 2,180.If the strength of the Royal Air Force were increased from the 49 squadrons which, on a basis of our present programme, it will possess in 1925 to a total of 191 squadrons by the formation of 142 new Regular Squadrons, the number of machines would be raised to 2,183, or three machines above the French figure.If these squadrons were organised in the same way as the 70 squadrons with which I have already dealt, I estimate that the annual cost to the Imperial Exchequer of this force of 2,183 effective machines with the requisite ancillary establishments would be approximately  35,000,000 per annum, an increase of about 133 per cent, on the present cost. This figure, like the earlier figure of  23,000,000, is exclusive of capital expenditure which I estimate would be in the neighbourhood of  42,000,000.The same considerations, however, apply in this case as in the case of the capital expenditure involved in the smaller increase, and here, too, I am of opinion that, if the Air Estimates were immediately raised to a figure of  35,000,000 per annum, the margin available during the years when the new squadrons were in process of formation would make it possible to find the money to meet the whole capital outlay of  42,000,000(10) without increasing the amount&quot; of the present Air Estimates by more than  20,000,000 a year.These figures show that a One-Power Standard would cost the country, upon a basis of the 1923 French strength,  23,000,000 a year, and, upon a basis of the 1925 French strength,  35,000,000 a year.When it is remembered that the national expenditure upon the fighting services has doubled since 1914, I hesitate to ask the Cabinet to agree to an additional expenditure of  8,000,000 a year immediately and  20,000,000 a year eventually on(8) In Appendix III I have compared this figure with the current French expenditure ou their naval and military air services. ; &quot;     l(3) Alternatively, it might be considered whether the works expenditure, which amounts to approxi-mately  6 500,000, could be raised by way of a terminable loan. There are precedents for this course, e.g., the Military Works Acts of 1897, 1899,1901 and 1903. .   ,,. ..m uw(10) Of this figure of  42,000,000,  17,000,000 represents expenditure on works; as to tins item, beefootnote (0) above.

the Royal Air Force. Until, therefore, we know whether the French programme is definitely to be carried into effect or not, I do not feel justified in asking the Cabinet to embark upon a One-Power Air Standard. Moreover, I cannot for the present suggest to them any other standard. But just because I cannot make a demand for a One-Power Standard or for any other rule-of-thumb standard, I feel the more fully &quot;Justified in asking Ministers to keep constantly in mind the air menace, and to give me all possible support in strengthening our position within the limits of practicable finance. Perhaps I may make the demand with the greater insistence from the fact that the Air Ministry is not directly represented in the Cabinet.If we. cannot have 1,178 machines now and 2,180 machines in 1925 to meet the French menace, we must go for quality and not quantity. Fortunately, all the available evidence tends to show that the Royal Air Force is greatly superior to the French force in efficiency. Several impartial observers point particularly to the increased efficiency which is already resulting from the operations of the independent Air Command in Iraq. In material, as well as in personnel, we must maintain this superiority. It is this need that makes the problem of research so vital to a country whose inferiority in numbers of machines is so great.Moreover, this numerical inferiority makes it all the more necessary for us to concentrate our organisation, and not to dissipate our strength by breaking up the Air Force into three fragments.It means also that we must take special pains with the training of our officers and men. The Royal Air Force is already the most technical fighting organisation in the world. Its capacity to deal effectively with greatly superior numbers will depend to a large extent upon the highly specialised training that is now being given at such stations as Cranwell and Halton.The Cabinet, therefore, should realise that, if they set aside the One-Power Standard as financially impracticable and cannot suggest any other standard, they must be prepared to maintain a highly-trained, and consequently expensive, Air corps d&apos;elite.Secondly, they should take such steps as will ensure the possibility of rapid expansion, should the necessity arise. The addition of the 15 Regular and 5 Auxiliary Squadrons that was sanctioned last summer was never intended as more than a minimum deterrent against hostile attack. Indeed, so limited a measure of expansion could only be justified by the late Cabinefs decision that the strength of the fighting forces should be fixed upon the assumption of no major war before 1929. I would, therefore, venture to emphasise to the Cabinet the urgent necessity for pro-viding, either by an Auxiliary Air Force or some other means, a number of cadre squadrons, and of increasing in every possible way our reserves of men and officers.Thirdly, they should realise that, if we cannot at present compete militarily with the French programme, we must give constant attention to the possibilities of Civil Aviation, if for no other purpose than to assist in keeping the aircraft industry alive. I may, however, add that even a large and flourishing system of civil air transport can no more be a substitute for a Regular Air Force (n) than the Mercantile Marine can be a substitute for the Navy. Civil Aviation can, however, be a useful and necessary supplement, and it is on this account that it is an essential factor in our air policy. If the new industry is to be firmly established the Treasury will have to find money and will have to take some risks. At the present time I am giving much attention to two phases of the civil problem, the question of cross-channel services and the possibility of an airship line, and I hope in the near future to put before the Cabinet proposals that will extricate the first of these questions from the hand-to-mouth drift of the last two years, and provide some basis for organic development. Here, again, I must ask for the sympathetic consideration of the Cabinet, if they deliberately and, in my view, reasonably set aside for the present the attainment of a One-Power Standard.From these observations it will be evident that I do not at present recommend the adoption of any rough-and-ready standard for assessing the requisite strength of the Royal Air Force, and that I rely rather upon the adoption of the less ambitious expedients that I have already outlined. I admit that for the time being we cannot compete with the French programme in the matter of quantity. At the same time I must point out that with a change for the worse in the political outlook we might be compelled to embark upon a more ambitious military programme than is at present contemplated. If the Cabinet now or in the future assume that a, major war is likely to take place before 1929, or if the French Chamber decides to carry the full projected(n) In this connection I would invite particular attention to Appendix II.
programme of expansion into effect forthwith, I should be compelled to reconsider my present views, and to press proposals for a- considerable increase of both regular and cadre squadrons.I have based this paper on the no-war assumption of the late Cabinet.  Will the present Cabinet tell me, whether I am to continue to adopt this assumption, arili if so, whether they agree or disagree with the general outline of policy that I have sketched?S. H.Air Ministry, February, 1923.APPENDIX I.Lord Balfour on the Air Menace.&quot; THE only country which can seriously menace us is France. A war with France would be a world calamity which seems almost unthinkable; but where national security is concerned even the unthinkable must be faced, and we must sometimes assume that to be possible which, in existing circumstances, seems only an evil dream.If we look at the problem from this angle our position is one of extreme peril. We must not suppose that the possibilities of an aerial attack in 1922 stand where they did in 1918. Our means of defence are now relatively far weaker. France&apos;s means of attack are relatively far more formidable. If we had to depend solely on anti-aircraft guns and other land defences, the French air forces at their present strength, or, to be precise, at the strength they would possess after a rapid mobilisation, would enable them to drop on London a continuous torrent of high explosives at the rate of 75 tons a day for an indefinite period. When it is remembered that in the worst. German raid only 3 tons were dropped on London, and that every raid was separated from its successor by a considerable interval of time, the overwhelming seriousness of the situation thus revealed must be obvious to all. Day after day, and night after night, the capital of the Empire would be subject to an unremitting bombardment of a kind which no city, effectively acting as the military, naval and administrative centre of a country engaged in a life and death struggle, has ever had to endure. The War Office and Admiralty would be paralysed by the destruction of the material instruments which are necessary for the conduct of their business. Lines of communication would be cut, and London would be uninhabitable probably in fact, certainly in the opinion of those who now dwell there&apos;.I say nothing about the arsenals, dockyards and defended harbours, nor about the shipping crowded in the Port of London, for the details of. the picture which I have just outlined are easily filled in.Have we any adequate methods of parrying a blow so sudden and so deadly? I cannot think so. The proper reply to aerial attack is aerial defence and aerial counter-attack; and our relatively insignificant air force is incapable of either.&quot;OLD. 108a, May, 1922.APPENDIX. II.The Military Value of Civil Aviation.WHILST I in no way wish to disparage the case for supporting British civil aviation, I append the following note on the limitations of civil aircraft for immediate military purposes.The analogy is often pressed between the Mercantile Marine and civil aviation, particularly from the point of view.of a reserve of personnel and materiel in time of war. It should be remembered in this connection that the Mercantile Marine is not a substitute for the fighting fleet, but a supplement to it, and that, whilst the British Mercantile Marine musters more than twice as many vessels as the American Mercantile Marine, a One-Power Standard is held to be a minimum for the British Navy.Secondly, the resemblance between the circumstances of the Mercantile Marine and civil aviation is somewhat superficial. The former owes much of its development
to the position of these islands on the outskirts of Europe, whilst in the ease of the latter our geographical situation is likely to be an obstacle to the development of air routes.Moreover, civil aircraft could not play the role in air warfare which is filled by j&amp;e Mercantile Marine in naval warfare. In the late war our merchant vessels &quot;^Rndered invaluable services, but with the exception of a few fast liners they could not and did not participate in major fleet.actions. Apart from the transportation of troops and supplies between the different theatres of war, their principal roles were those of fleet tenders, of minesweepers and of &quot; Q &quot; ships and other instruments of the anti-submarine campaign; minesweeping and the anti-submarine campaign in particular engaged many hundred ships. There will be no parallel to the two latter roles in air warfare, and but limited scope for the first.Again, owing to the very high rate of aircraft wastage in war and the need for the continual replacement of different parts, a large stock of reserve machines and spares is required with the result that standardisation is essential. The whole tendency of civil aircraft design is in the opposite direction. There is little standardisation in the Mercantile Marine, but owing to the relatively long life of naval craft, diversity of type is of little moment.Further, the utility of civil machines for the performance of military operations is limited in other directions. The divergency between the designs of aircraft for civil and service purposes is bound to increase as time goes on, since their respective requirements are essentially different. Climb and ceiling, for example, are of little importance to civil machines which almost invariably operate at heights below 5,000 feet; and the manoeuvrability which air fighting demands is for them a relatively minor consideration. Indeed, of the many and various operations that are now performed by aircraft in war, troop-carrying and night-bombing are the only two which could be carried out by civil machines with any degree of effectiveness. As the science of air warfare is highly technical, only Regular Squadrons, for example, would be of value as fighters for Home Defence purposes; they will have to be so trained and organised, as to be able to leave their sheds with the speed and precision of a Fire Brigade and take the air at a moment&apos;s notice.As to whether the expansion of the Royal Air Force or the development of civil aviation is at present the most expeditious and economical means of improving our air defence, it is worth testing the military value of civil aviation in France at a time when 100,000,000 francs are being spent/ under this head of which 45,000,000 francs have been allocated to civil subsidies.The nine firms, which are in receipt of subsidies, maintain a total of only 86 pilots and 271 machines. The number of licensed pilots in non-subsidised firms, schools, &amp;c, in addition to these 86 is 178. Over and above these 271 machines there are about 400 other civil aircraft on the French register. Of these, some 160 are. machines used for training in civilian schools, and the remaining 240 probably consist to a considerable extent of machines of obsolete or obsolescent types, a propor-tion of which are not even maintained in flying trim. Moreover, of the 3,300 machines that were constructed in France in 1922, no less than 3,000 were absorbed by the French naval and military air services.These figures, it will be admitted represent, from the narrow military aspect, a very inadequate return for an annual outlay of 100,000,000 francs in other words, of 22 per cent, of the total expenditure on the French naval and military air services in 1922.I should, however, add that, as the Royal Air Force has attained a higher pitch of efficiency than the French naval and military air services, so, when once the critical initial stages of development have been successfully passed, we should almost certainly obtain greater military advantages from civil aviation in the British Empire &quot;than the French have obtained in France.It is on this account that, whilst I cannot at present regard the development of civil aviation as a solution of our difficulties, I am not prepared to ignore any potential asset. It is necessary, therefore, to adopt a policy sufficiently generous both in time and money to make development possible.
APPENDIX III.Comparative Cost of British and French Air Services.THE annual cost to the Imperial Exchequer of maintaining the Royal AP Force at a strength, of 1,177 machines, i.e., roughly the present French strength, would, it is estimated, amount to  23,000,000. The financial provision made by the French in 1922 is estimated, at 469,112,136 francs, This figure is arrived at (as. explained in the appendix to C.I.D. Paper No. 109a, Note D) by taking the actual provision shown in Estimates and adding thereto an arbitrary figure of 25 per cent, to represent air expenditure &quot; concealed &quot; under heads of the main naval and military votes which contain an indeterminate proportion of air expenditure. The provision for 1923 is likely to be on a larger scale, since it is known that last year&apos;s provision has been found inadequate in the light of experience, insufficient sums having been allowed in particular for spares and other items for the upkeep of material. The relative cost per fighting unit will, however, always be higher in the Royal Air Force than in the French air services for the reasons fully developed in paragraphs 5 to 8 of C.I.D. Paper No. 109a, the principal of which are : (a.) The advantage conferred on the French by conscription, which means a .,, much lower expenditure than is necessary in the case of a volunteer force on such items as pay, allowances, rations, clothing and works, and also, since it makes it possible to draw on the pick of the young mechanics in. civil engineering shops and factories, does away with the necessity for maintaining large instructional establishments for the purpose of training raw personnel ah initio after recruitment.(6.) The geography of the British Empire; the Mediterranean, Egypt, Palestine, Iraq and India, in which 20 squadrons of the Royal Air Force are normally stationed, lie at a far greater distance from the British Isles than Algeria, Tunis, Morocco or Syria from France, and the transport costs in respect of these 20 squadrons are in consequence far heavier, to say nothing of the large working margin of personnel (1,500) which has to be maintained for reliefs, &amp;c, for these distant theatres. Moreover, the fact that so large a proportion of the Royal Air Force is stationed overseas under active service conditions means that training cannot be carried out in squadrons, but separate flying training schools have to be maintained.
