(This Document is the Property of. His, Britannic Majesty&apos;e Government)C,A..B .IJET, Copy No,C.P.. 12 fS3)IiroSTRIAL, ASSURANCE.BILL^ &quot; memorandum by^the financial ^Secretary .to the^ Treasury^In the absence $f the Chancellor of the Exchequer I desire to circulate the following memorandum on the Industrial Assurance Bill,In 1919 owing to various alleged scandals in connection with Industrial Assurance, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Parmoor was appointed to enquire into the genera], aciminiBtra* tioh of Industrial Assurance Companies and Collecting Societies. The Committee found that the existing law left openirgw for con-siderable abuses, and in 1920 submitted a report reeommehding that such companies and societies should be brought under stricter con-trol with a view to securing better proteation for the policy holders,Hitherto those companies have been under no greater oontrol than the ordinary company registered with the Board of Trade and the Committee recommended that the moro detailed control they proposed should &quot;he exercised by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies who already looks after Friendly Societies and Industrial Provident Societies,   The Friendly Societies Regis-try has, since its institution about 40 years ago, been under the control of the Treasury, but as the necessary legislation in connection with Industrial Assurance would be&apos;pf a, somewhat intricate and legal character, it was arranged by the then Chan-oellor of tho Exchequer (Mr,Austen Chamberlain) that the Home Secretary (Mr.Shortt) should take over the task of piloting the Bill through the House of CommonscA
A Bill was accordingly.prepared and introduced into the House of Lords &quot;by Lord Onslow, the Home Office representative, in August 1921, not with a view to its making any progrees that Session, hut in order that the Government proposals might he published to the persons affected and that any representations made by them might be considered before legislation was introduced in 1922.     There was considerable opposition to this Bill, and  -during the earlier months of last year lengthy negotiations took place with representatives of the Companies and Societies.   As a result, Mr, Shortt circulated to the Cabinet in June last a rtvised Bill (CP.4038) so amended as to meet the main objections raised to the Bill of 1921 and it was his intention to introduce this Bill in the autumn.     A Committee representing the principal Companies and Societies and all the Agents&apos; Unions has been informed of the changes proposed and representations from other bodies interested have been considered and in most cases adopted;   and the revised Bill as now settled would not only be accepted by the Companies and Societies and their Agents, but would be actually welcomed.     A copy is attached.Luring the recent election, candidates for Parliament were circularised as to their attitude in regard to a Bill on these lines, and the replies shew that of the successful candidates 363 had expressed their general agreement without reservations, 169 made various reservations, and 7 definitely opposed it, no informa-tion being available in respect of 76 including 32 who were returned unopposed and a number of members of the Government.   It would  . appear therefore that the Bill as now revised is not likely to raise much opposition in the House though there may be criticism from isolated members that it does not go far enough for the pro-tection of the policy holders.The Bill will effect very useful and much needed reforms especially in the way of (a) preventing insolvent Companies andSocieties
H fti kSocieties from continuing to collect premiums after it can ba shewn &quot;by actuarial calculation that they will not he able to meet their liabilities, (b) providing that holders of industrial policies who have contributed for considerable periods and are then unable to continue their premiums shall receive either a free paid-up policy or in certain cases a surrender value and shall not - as is now their fate in many cases - lose all the money they have paid in, and (c) ensuring that proper funds and reserves are created and maintained for the protection of such holders,A decision is accordingly required from the Cabinet as to (1) whether a Bill should be introduced during next session and (2) what Minister should be charged with the duty of conducting it through the House of Commons.As regards (l) the Treasury view is that the Bill 1b sufficiently attractive and important to merit a place in the King&apos;s Speech for next Session.As regards (2) it is suggested that in view of the legal questions involved the most appropriate tinieter to have charge of the Bill would be one of the Law Officers.     The present Home Secretary, who is not a lawyer, does not see his way to take over his predecessor^ responsibility in this matter, which indeed would not normally come within the purview of his Department.J ,Yvr.
