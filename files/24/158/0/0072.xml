As regards the main, point raised In the Memorandum by the First Parliamentary Counsel attached to your paper of. the 20th January, Theiu Lordships are of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not allow themselves to be deprived of the use of the fine old phrase &quot;The United Kingdom&quot;.     While it may be necessary in cases where Parlia-ment is defining the limits within which a particular Act of Parliament Is- to operate, to use an exact phrase like &quot;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;, It should be possible and(9 SecretaryHome Affairs Committee of the Cabinet,2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W..1.

For instance, the Patent of the Board of Admiralty -appoints &quot;Commissioners for executing the Office of Our High Admiral of Our United Kingdom&quot;;   ar-d no reason is seen for.altering this phrase or for discontinuing the use of the lords &quot;Lord High Adrlral of the United Kingdom&quot; in the preamble of the Army Annual&apos;Act.I am, *.Sir,. .; -      -    ,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd?   0.

Admiralty Act 1832Section V. Style and Title of Commissioners of the Admiralty,       &apos; rIt Is titlesuggested that this style and i.e.&quot;of the United: Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; should remain,; seeing that the defence of Irish Waters is a reserved matter and still rests with the. admiralty     Whatever &quot;style and title&quot; be adopted it should, presumably-apply to&quot; all Statutes -where Admiralty is mentioned or defined.Naval Discipline Act1866Section 46,    &quot;United Kingdom&quot; and.&quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&quot;Section .58.(13) for &quot;United Kingdom&quot;Section. 70:.  for &quot;United;. Kingdom&quot;Section 80:.   &quot;-United Kingdom&quot;-It - is suggested that for the words -&quot;United Kingdom&quot;&apos; (&quot;3 times), there should be substituted.whatever term is to be used.to signify&quot;the.&quot;United Kingdom minus the Irish Free State&quot;:and that the words &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland-&quot; &quot; should be., left as they- are.Substitute term signifying &quot;United Kingdom minus Irish Free State&quot;Substitute term.signifying &quot;United Kingdom minus Irish Free State&apos;.&apos;This Section gives power to the: Admiralty to remove an insane prisoner or person under detention to  in Asylum in the United Kingdom.    If such a person is-an Irishman it would be. proper &quot;for him to be sent to an Irish Lunatic Asylum;   -this, should be Becuredby the. words &quot;United kingdom&apos; con-tinuing to refer to Ireland,-

Admiralty Court Aot 1861.Dockyards &amp;o. Protection Aot 1772The Registrar of the Admiralty division reports as follows:-Foreign Enlistment Act 1870.Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Aot 1878.It is assumed that the words &quot;if any person ehall either within this. Realm, or in any of the Islands, Countries, Forts or places thereunto belongingwilfully.....set on fire.....any ofHis Majesty&apos;a Arsenals, Magazines,Dockyards &amp;c......or Stores or otherAmmunition&quot;Clause 30.    Definition of &quot;United Kingdom&quot; and British Possessions&quot;Thbre does not appear to &quot;be anything to affeot. the jurisdiction of the Kif-a Court of Juatice in Admiralty.by the creation of an Irish Free State.    The only matter whiJh I can find which may be; affected by the change, ia the service of a subpoena.     By the Admiralty Court Aot 1861, Seo.21.&quot;The service in any part of Great: Britain or Ireland of any erit of Subpoena ad testifioandum or subpoena duces tecum, issued under the seal -of. the High Court of Admiralty,., shall be as effectual as if - the same had been&apos; served, in Enp;land Wales&quot;.      The 6eal would;have, since 1873,    to.be that of the -High Court of Justice..    It would seem -that the change in the position of Ireland may possibly have the effeot of nullifying the words &quot;or Ireland&quot;. But ao far as v-ords go, tha 3hange would not alter the right to service a subpoena in all parts of Ireland.It is assumed this long definition of places will still include South Ireland,    In view of the retention by the Admiralty of the Dockyard at Berehaven it is considered it should.It is assumed that any changes ..in the cohnotatig. of &quot;United.Kingdom&quot; will still keep the Irish Free State subject to this Statute.Same remarks apply as to Foreign Enlistment Act.
Dockyard Ports Section 2.      The Definition of DockyardPeculation Act 1865.        .Port as any Port, Harbour Ac...........of the United Kingdom in or near which H.M,....... as a Dockyard......wharf ormooring.Naval Artillery Section 16.      Volunteers to be employedVolunteers Act 1373 in ships to be engaged in the defenceof the Coasts of the &quot;United Kingdom&quot; Channel Islands &amp;c. and on service in the Seas adjacent.It is necessary, that &quot;United Kingdom&quot; in this definition should continue to include Ports &amp;c of the Irish Free State, as Berehaven,  already a Dockyard Port is reserved to the Admiralty.Clearly as the Admiralty has&quot; th3 Haval Defence&apos; of Ireland the Coasts of the  &quot;United Kingdom&quot; should include the Coasts of Ireland.
