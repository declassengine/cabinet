This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. 3( Copy No. ^ ^CP. 40 (23).THE CABINET.STANDING  JOINT  COMMITTEE FOR  EX-SERVICEQUESTIONS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The genesis of the Committee was as stated by the Minister of Pensions in his memorandum (OP. 4372). The Chairmanship and composition of the Committee show clearly that it was intended to deal with questions affecting the resettlement and other claims of officers and men of the Great War, and not to develope into a permanent organization coming between the Service departments and the professional sailors, soldiers and airmen with whom the Ministries of Labour and Pensions have no concern. The War Office representative has consistently maintained this view of the scope of the Committee.The necessity for a clear definition of this scope has been all along apparent, and the ex-service representatives at different times have asked to see before publication the regulations for post-war disability pensions which apply only to the professional post-war regular soldier, and have raised questions relating to the emoluments of officers and men during their service with the Colours. After much discussion the Service departments agreed to a compromise, as explained by the Minister of Labour. (I understand that the views expressed in the undated Admiralty letter in Appendix A of the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 4373) have since been modified.)I have no objection to this compromise being tried for 12 months from the present date, as proposed by the Minister of Labour, if the ex-service representatives will accept it; but on the permanent merits of the question, I am glad to see that the Minister of Pensions recognizes that the Committee, as at present constituted, is altogether unsuited to deal with questions affecting the post-war regular personnel of the fighting Services, and that the Chairman&apos;s position in this respect might well become difficult.I very much . doubt whether airy Committee including representatives of the ex-service organizations is necessary for such questions ; but if the 12 months&apos; trial shows that it is, the satisfactory course would be to set up an entirely separate Committee to deal with questions affecting regular officers or men after completion of their service. The official side of this Committee would be composed of representatives of the three Service Departments a Minister of each of them acting as Chairman in rotation......d.The Was Office,23rd January, 1923.(B23/54)   100   1/23   W.O.P,   645
