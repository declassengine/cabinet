MIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC ^JES^jS^oyBRMFJ^ SECRET.                                     CAB IN ET,CP.84(23). - 730MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT. IRoad Works for the Relief of Unerrplo yment.I have seen the memorandum (CP. 53 (23)) circulated by the Unemployment Committee of the Cabinet and I wish.to ask that the Cabinet will take an early opportunity of considering the matter.     A decision should if possible be reached before the debate on the address dealing with unemployment, since if the Cabinet decide that no further road schemes are to be assist-ed beyond those contained in the programme of  3,500,000 ( 1,750,000 Road Fund contribution), to which sanction was given by Cabinet minute 4(23) it will be necessary to write to all other local authorities who have submitted schemes informing them that no grant can be made.In addition to the sanctioned programme 132 schemes (total value about  2,000,000) were shown in Cabinet memorandum C.U.511 and many others have been submitted by local authorities. A large proportion of these schemes have now been in the office many weeks and many of them have been examined by the road engineers and passed for approval.     The authorities are pressing for a final answer, in some cases on the grounds that they will put in hand other proposals if they know that no money is avail-able for roads, and a final answer cannot be delayed.I suggest that in the event of no further money being available from the Road Fund the local authorities should be informed that the Road Fund moneys derived from motor taxes which are available for road improvement have now been allocated to approved schemes and the Minister regrets that it will not be possible to assist any further schemes for this winter from, that source.-     But that schemes designed to relieve unemployment this winter will be considered by the Unemployment Grants Committee to whom their application has been submitted.
6th February, 1923-This last suggestion, violates the principle at present observed that schemes of road improvement eligible for assistance from the Road Fund should not bo assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee,, but I suggest that in order to mitigate the serious and widespread disappointment which will result from the issue of this intimation ta local authorities, the suggestion of possible assistance from, the Unemployment Grants Committee is desirable.I desire also to make cloar that if the Cabinet were to decide to allow further advances on the security of the Road Fund in future yl&amp;rri, fivon by onmmitting t&amp;a Fund fully up to 1929 and obtaining.the promise of finance from the Treasury, it would only be possible to&apos;make grants to these schemes already submitted and. unless and until some of these schemes are definitely abandoned uo further proposals can be considered.(Signed)   WILFRID ASHLEY.I.approve.(Initialled)    J.B.- &apos;
