Mr POULTON:   Mr, Premier, I have to express the thanks of the Council to yon for giving -as&quot; this interview9 and I am desired to ask first of all, so that we may have a clear understanding about it, as to the question of the Press.   Our own view is, and we shall be glad if you can see your way to fall in with it, that we should have a verbatim report sent out immediately.TUB PRIME MINISTER:   Yes, certainly.Mr POULTON!   We know that your time is valuable, so we have arranged to have three speakers apart from myself. The speakers will be Mr Hayday&apos; M.P., Mr G. Hicks, and Mr Robert Smillie.The statement I have to present on behalf of the Council is as follows:-
4 Q 9 IDcJ&quot;The Trades Union Congress General Council have already placed on record their protest against the prorogation of Parliament from 15th December to 12th February, by calling a number of representative demonstrations in various parts of the country.     At these demonstrations the following resolution has been adopted:-&quot;This Mass Meeting of workers and citizens protests against the action of the Government in declaring the prorogation of Parliament until February 13th, 1923.     ve denounce this declaration of a prolonged holiday for legislators and regard it as a manifestation of indifference to the chronic suffering of thousands of men, women and children directly affected by the long-continued unemployment. We call upon the Prime Minister at once to take steps to summon Parliament to deal with this problem as a national emergency of vital importance, and we also call upon the Government to take such action as will secure employment for willing workers, or the alterna-tive of utilising the full resources of the State in order to provide a standard of maintenance 3uch as will prevent the deterioration of those who continue to suffer the consequences of our industrial stagnation&quot;.TiO have, further, to emphasise this protest by calling your attention to the serious state of affairs which has now developed as a result of prolonged unemployment.     Thou-sands of working-class homes are in a state of chronic destitution, local authorities in a state of bankruptcy, and, within certain areas, Co-operative Societies, private traders and business men generally are very rapidly approaching a state of bankruptcy due to bad trade caused by the. cessation of wage earning among a substantial proportion of the popula-tion.
It has been estimated that the total amount now being spent on unemployment by the State and local authorities, is approximately  100,000,000 a year.     The following figures relating to Poor Law expenditure out of rates, in England and Wales, also demonstrate   the extensive character of extreme destitution:-POOR-LAWiEXPENDITURE FROM RATES ALONE.1913-14................. 12,060,0001920-21..,................  32,000,0001921-22*..................  42,000,0001922-23. (Estimate)........  40,000,000This cost, apart from many other items of expenditure being borne by the community is a matter of importance but it is a matter of greater importance to take into consideration the serious reduction in the physical and mental capacity of a very largo number of potential wealth producers, which is bound to result from the continuation of the state of affairs represented by the figures to which we have drawn your attention.THE EFFECT ON TRADE UNIONS.We have to declare that trade union organisations have a special claim to be heard on this question.     As representing a very substantial proportion of the wage-earning population, which has been called upon to provide funds for public assistance, through the operation of the Insurance Acts, in addition to their share of the burdens which have to be borne by increased local and national taxation, we have also to submit to special facts in relation to the burden imposed upon trade unions by the long-continued prevalence of excessive unemployment.

Out of the total number of unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, at that time, namely 185, 154 unions sent us returns showing that during the year ending September 1921,  7,434,199 had beon paid, out for the relief of unemployment provided by trade union contributions paid by members who are also taxed to provide funds for the relief of unemployment as insured workers and citizens.;&apos;&apos;e are not able to supply you at the moment with particulars showing the total amount provided by the trade unions, up to date.     The following unions, however, can be taken as typical examples and the facts show the amount of benefits they have provided during the years 1921 and 1922:-UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PAID FROM UNION FUNDS DURING1921 AND 1922.
THE PRIME MINISTER: What period do these figurescover? &quot;        9pMR. POULTGN: 1921-22*     I will hand the document over0as soon as   I have read ita     The Engineering figures were from July 1920 to May 1922,     That Is the one difference in the area covered.&quot;In two cases, namely, the Workers1 Union and the National Union of General Workers, the figures relate almost entirely to the year&apos;1921 only.     In the case of the Amalgamated Engineering Union the period covered by the figures is from July 1920 to May 1922.In addition to the increased liability imposed on wage earners caused by continued unemployment, the state of depression in the Labour market has also compelled the workers to accept a substantial reduction in wages.     In 1921 the total reductions reported to the Ministry of Labour amounted to  6^006,000 per week and in 1922,  4,169,200. In both years the reductions covered practically the same groups of workers, the total weekly reduction being  10,175,200 or approximately  529,110,400 a years,In addition to the reductions officially reported, covering not more than seven-and-a-half million workers, reductions were also sustained by about six million workers of not less than  3,000,000 per week, giving us a total weekly reduction of  13,000,000, or a yearly reduction of approximately  676,000,000 in the wages bill,A reduction also took place in the cost of living but not by any means proportionate to the fall of wages in many industries.     But for the prevailing stagnation of trade, and the presence of abnormal unemployment, this reduction in wages would not have been as rapid as the above figures demonstrate.These facts should indicate to you the special interest we have as trade unionists in the problem of unemployment from the point of view of wages and the
financial stability ef the organisations we represent.     We are also deeply concerned regarding the social consequences of prolonged unemployment and, under these circumstances, and in view cf the disastrous consequences which are bound to follow continued idleness for such a large number of potential workers, we again express our disappointment that a two months&apos; holiday for Parliament should have been declarEmployed and unemployed workers have taken this prolonged cessation of Parliamentary activity as an indication of indifference on the part of the Government and Parliament.     We have to suggest that the problem is of sufficient importance and the issues involved of such a vital character, that more parliamentary time should have been given to the consideration of the question, and that the Government should have given the lead in utilising the total resources of the State in the effort to deal effectively with the present situation.In the Ejame of organised labour, we have, therefore, to proposethat you, as the responsible head of the Government, should take immediate steps to secure the reassembling of Parliament for the purpose of dealing with the unemployed problem.&quot;
1J 8I do not propose to say any more at the present moment, because, as I have stated, we have three speakers and I know your time is valuable.   I therefore hand in the document and call upon Mr Hayday.Mr A. HAYBAffjMaP.:   Mr Prime Minister and Gentlemen,while endorsing all of the arguments put forward in the document read by Mr Poulton5 I wish to add one or two furtherreasons why we feel that Parliament should be called together as early as possible. The first is the inadequacy of thepresent provisions that are made to meet unemployment payments in the form of benefits during the uncovenanted period, whichis causing very grave concern.   The first uncovenanted period as from November of last year till the end of June of thepresent year, is one of 12 weeks, and that 12 weeks is com-pleted by next Wednesday.   Next Wednesday is the first 12weeks of the fourth special period of uncovenanted benefit.That means, Sir, that after Wednesday next the whole of those on uncovenanted donation as from the commencement of November last/will have to have their case reviewed.   The reviewing of those cases is bound to cause considerable delay in meeting the necessary payments for at least a week or two, and, according to our past experience in some cases quite six weeks. If they are admitted to a further period, that further period is one that must not aggregate more than five weeks, even after the whole of those cases have been enquired into, and after that five weeks has elapsed, which will only carry us then early into March, there is to be another review, and then those who are successful will get a further five weeks, making a total of uncovenanted benefit of 22 weeks to cover a period of 33 weeks.   That means 11 weeks without any pro-vision at all to those who are unfortunate enough   we are sorry, we cannot see any hope of their being absorbed into employment between now and June next   that will leave 11 weeks without any provision at all.   But the immediate seriousness of the position is the fact that next Wednesday,-7-
with Parliament not sitting, the 12 weeks of uncoTenanted benefit will have expired.   I venture to suggest that there must be fully half or more of those at present drawing Unemployment Benefit who are drawing uncovenanted benefit.SIR MONTAGUE BARLOW:    I do not think that is so.Mr BAYDAY:   I shall be very pleased to know that the figure is much less, because it is certain to our knowledge that there are some who have been continuously unemployed for periods of over 18 months, and the longest period for which they can draw covenanted benefit., with stamps to their credit, is a total of 36 weeks till they re-qualify again. So that there must be many many thousands who are on uncovenanted benefit.   With the expiration of each special period the Labour Minister has power to make certain regula-tions.   These regulations in the past have of course meant that on the review all the applicants are not re-admltted to the extended period of uncovenanted benefit.   Many of them, for such reasons as &quot;single persons&quot;, cr if enquiry is made into the income of the home and it is found that that together with incomes from other sources should be sufficient-ent to provide the bread and margarine   that is used as one reason why they should net go on fcr the extended period of uncovenanted benefit.   That is causing much anxiety not only to those of us on the General Council of the Trade Union Congress, but to the whole of the unemployed,--coming on top of their past bitter experience, as you will well remember, Mr Premier, of the Debate in the House over the question cf gaps.   When those gaps arrived, the throwing of that extra dead weight on to the Poor Law Authorities almost broke down and crippled their machinery altogether. We fear that unless some provision is made   and we think Parliament should meet in order to make that provision and clear away that doubt   that only adds to the worries and the terrors of those who are unemployed.-8-
One further point I would submit, and that is the position of the women unemployed.   In all the schemes that were outlined during the last Session there was no provi-sion made in any of them such as would absorb any of the unemployed women. True, the Government has made provision, I thinks by the contribution of  100,000 towards Training Schemes, Home Grafts, and so on, but that in the sum total only provides for three months&apos; training to a maximum number of 5,000 females in this country who are unemployed, and the total registered for December is 189,900, a number increased in December over the previous October by 13,000. So that, in face of the fact that 13,000 more women registered as unemployed, the sum total of the schemes arranged by the Government in these Training and Home Crafts Centres only absorbs 5,000.   So that while you have provided for 5,000 you have to face the fact that 13,000 more registered as unemployed, bringing the figure up to that huge total of 189,900.   We really do urge this, in face of the position that is confronting the country at the moment and the disturbance that is taking place in the minds not only of the unemployed but of thos? who are in employment, - the sacrifices that are continually being made that could not be put before you in terms of figures, the sacrifice of ha If the dinner of on9 neighbour who can ill afford to spare it, in order to make some provision ^or a neighbour that is a little worse off.   Trades Unions like the National Union of General Workers had to cease administering Unemployment Benefit becavise its contribu-tions   being 5d. or 6d. per week, and in face of 100,000 or more of its members being unemployed   could not be got in sufficient volume to continue making some small allowance to its unemployed.   All the other sources, such as Local Authorities, Trade Union sources, Friendly Societies, the philanthropy or the sacrifice of the co-worker
are drying up;   they ars becoming exhausted.   There is only one real source capable of dealing with the position, and that is the Government itself, Parliament itself, and we would therefore urge that you should summon or car.se Parliament to be summoned together long before February 13th and not wait until the position becomes aggravated by the lapsing first of the special period that will leave some without any provision at all or having to go to the Poor Law Authorities.   I think you will agree that the Government, Parliament, should seriously take into account all the circumstances surrounding it, and it is not fair that we should be away from the legislative chamber while all this suffering is going on, when guidance and aid are so necessary from the Parliament of the day.&quot;-&apos;r POULTON:   To reduce the number of speakers, Mr Hicks will not avail himself o^ speaking.   Mr Smillxe will there-fore speak now.Mr SMIL1IB:    I do not think that much can bs added to&apos; the very full statement contained in the typewritten memorandum, that will be placed before you, but there are one or two points to which we should like to call your special attention. Figures such as are presented here are astonishing in them-selves, but no figures and no speeches can convey adequately the terrible suffering which is going on at the present time amongst the ranks of the workers.   It is only in the working-class districts, and in the poorest of the districts in the various industrial centres that one really comas to realise the misery and suffering which exist.   Many of the unemploy-ed, who had spent a decent useful life for many years, have found that their children have been begging from door to door.   They would not be allowed to beg at the doors of rich men, neither would they feel inclined to go to thedoors of rich men; but we find them going to the doors of their fellow-workers who in many casas have great difficulty in providing avem for their own.-10-
142( Mr. Smillie speaking)-&quot;&quot; &apos;M wThere is not any doubt at all that not only the reduced rates of wages which are current at the present time, but also the fact of unemployment, is detracting very seriously from the future mental and physical well-being of the people of this country.   Hundreds of thousands of children are being insufficiently   fed, hundreds of thousands of children are facing this winter without boots or stockings and with insufficient clothing.   One thing which has been dinned into our ears for years, and especially during the last ten years, has been the necessity of giving to the young in this country the chance of becoming strong men and   women both physically and mentally.   V.&apos;e are not at the present time providing for such mental and physical strength for our future people. Should a serious epidemic break out,- and I think we are threatened at the present time with, something of that kind in many directions - then the children of the people - of the working-classes generally - would die off like flies because of the fact that their systems have been undermined through lack of nourishment.Now, Sir, I have met two classes of people during my fairly long career in the   Labour movement.   I have met them on Local Councils and amongst politicians.   Some men and women, if you convince them of a wrong being done that might be righted, will agree with you, but will never take any steps to put that wrong right!.   Other men and women whom I have met both amongst local administrators and amongst politicians, in this room and in other places, if you can convince them of the wrong, and show them that they can be any means in their power put that wrong right, ,will get about doing their best.    I personally feel -804 1 think my colleagues share my feeling - that if we can con-Tince you, Mr. Prime Minister, that a wrong exists affecting hundreds of thousands of men women and children in this country, and that you in your position at the head of the Government
with your colleagues can by any reasonable means put that wrong riPhtj you will do your best to do so.   We are here today with $ view of trying to impress upon you to do what in our opinion is &amp; necessary thing.     It is not a big thing, but it is very, very necessary.   We ere only impressing upon you the necessity, because of the seriousness of the situation, of re-assembling Parliament at the earliest possible moment.     We cannot emphasised-sise too strongly - what has been stated in Mr. PoultonTs speech -that the deterioration, not only physical but mental, which is taking plaoe, especially amongst the very highly skilled ror-kers of this country, is considerable.   Theie is not any doubt at all that men working at the most necessary trades - necessary in the interests of the country - require very high skill, and we are proud of the faot that we have probably the most highly skilled as well as the most willing class of wo risers that could le produced in any part of the world.     But as the months go on these men begin to lose touch and-gradually to deteriorate and fall from the position of first-rank workers to that of second or third-rank workers.   Then there is another thing.   Fery often our people are charged with laziness.   Generally speaking, our people are not lazy, but I think it will be found that after three or four months, or especially after a year or two, of unemploy-ffient men and women who have been earnestly searching for employ-ment become lowered to the point that at length they are not so much caring whether they get employment or not.   They lose heart end soul and everything.   Prom that point of view it is highly necessary that something should be done.It is a remarkable thing that there is hunger in this country at the present time.   There is shortage in many directions. Children and womenfolk are going without boots and stocking. If there v/ere a famine in the land we could understand that, Sir,-if there were a famine oaused by blockade or by some failure of crops we could understand that the population of this country
would be rationed, and that whatever was available would, ia^tie-tice were donej be shaded among the population.   But there is no faminei theite is no scarcity of any of the things required, and yet side by side with this we have suffering, starvation, yes, and even death to be attributed directly to this unemployment. Well now that picture if it is true - if it is not true we would like it denied and disproved - is a terrible picture, and it is the duty of every man and woman of goodwill, and especially is it tho duty of those at the head of the Government, to do their best to put this wrong right0     We do not come here to you with any cut and dried schemes.   We recognise the terrible diffi-culty of the position.     At the present time the local authori-ties in many cases are bankrupt, and it ought to be realised that where the local authorities have the most numerous and ur-gent calls upon them is in the poorer class localities.    The :.; consequence is that the bulk of ratepayers in those localities are themselves, though possibly employed, on account of low wages brought to a point at which they are not able to face the rates Aut upon them.to relieve locally the suffering that takes place.   That is rather an important point.    I trust that you and my &quot;colleagues may forgive me if I refer to the mining community in this respect.     I noticed yesterday an outcry &apos; in the newspaper, said to be an outcry of the mine-owners, for more coal, and asking that the seven-hoursr day should be with-drawn by legislation, and that the miners should go back to the eight-hour or longer day.     It was   said that they were physically fit to do that before., and they ought to be physi-2ally fit to do it now.     But, Sir, we have, on the Statute Book -and we are always being urged to obey the law - what is known as the Seven Hour Mines Act.     At the present time in many dis-tricts we have hundreds of unemployed miners, and yet in. many cases the management of the collieries and the under-officials are urging our men to&apos;work an eight, a nine, or even a ten-
hours&apos; clay.     Shey are urging them under threats of dismissal I&apos;.   some oases to work double shifts, and this while there are at many collieries 20, 50 or 40 miners asking for employment and standing in unemployed queues.     It would be a sensible way of lessening unemployment to allow those who are unemployed to be absorbed in the industry rather than to keep other men working for longer hours.     That would relieve the position to some ex-tent.     We urge you, in the interests of the unemployed and&apos;of the nation as a whole - because none of us can conceive to what extent the unemployed problem re-acts on the nation&apos;s problem in the future - to re-assemble Parliament.     V.&apos;e are not here to tell you how the unemployed problem should be dealt with.     It is our business to convince you that something is necessary, and we fool that it is the duty of those responsible for the Government of the country to see that the wrong which exists shall be fully or at any rate partially righted, and to think out the moans of doing so.   Besides that, we feel that it is the representatives of the whole people in Parliament who should be called upon to set about this task and we urge you to re-assemble Parliament at the earliest I possible moment.    Wo can guarantee that the direct representa-a 1 tives of Labour, as we call them, in the House of Commons will give you every assistance in their power provided you allow them the opportunity of raising their voice on this question.THE PRIME MINISTER:   You come to me, gentlemen, with only one definite proposal, and I shall say with equal definiteness what attitude the Government intends to take up with regard to I that.     But you have dwelt a great deal on the general situa-tion, and I think that before I give you the answer to your &apos;proposal I should like to say a few words on that subject.    Mr. iSoulton and other speakers who have followed him have dwelt upon : uhe evils arising out of present conditions.   It is not necessary to ^phasise that.     We all feel It.     I said once before -chat I obviously people who do not themselves feel hungry cannot feel it
14:8as acutely as those who have suffered that calamity. It does not need much imagination to realise tho seriousness of the present situation.   It is quite true, and gratifying so far as it goes, that the number of unemployed, compared with the worst period, has fallen very largely.   It was at one time over two millions, and in spite of the fact that this is the season of the year when one would expect an increase, there has not been during this win-ter the increase which we might have anticipated. But that does not in our eyes in the least hide the extent of the evil, and the evil is added to, I think, by the long continuance of the unemployment, to an extent which people hardly realise.   You, Sir, have given an indication of it by showing the extent to which the Trade Union i&apos;uuda have been depleted. But the fact which goes deepest is that thrifty, hard-working men, who have accumulated some savings, have seen them all disappear. Therefore it is obvious that the longer this hardship continues, the greater will be the suffering and the more difficult the remedy,   kr. Smillie, who has been speaking temperately and in a way that would call for the sympathy of anyone, and not merely of Labour representatives, has put the case quite clearly. Be has said that there were two classes of people in his experience: those who admitted the evil but did nothing to remedy it, and another class who if they felt an evil also felt that it was their busi-ness as far as possible to remedy it. I hope that the Government will be oongiiileret&apos; to belong to the latter class. But the differ-ence which arises always, not only in Ciscusoions in this room, but in discussions in the House of Commons, is as to the method hy which the Government can effectually help the situation. I am convinced, as of course you know, that the scheme which is recommended by so many Lemhors of the House of Commons, involving a complete upsetting of our present social conditions, would not make things better but worse. That is a matter with regard to which, naturally,   those who differ from me will take a
[different view.   But so far as this- Parliament is concerned ,&apos;we    i&apos; Lave got to aot on the assumption that any improvement we oan Lake is within the limits of our present scoial system.   Mpwj Lw can we remedy it?    Mr,. Poulton pointed out that there had Len a fall in wages of something like  6 00,000,000 a year.     I bid quite readiness!y to admit that if that amount were being paid in wage? now it would itself create a demand for commodities which would in turn cause other people to be employed, and if this were [possible the unemployment problem would be easily dealt with-[But how is that  600, 000,000 to be got?     I know of only two Iways.   The one method would be by the workmen getting a larger I share of the profits of industry.    I daresay - this is a question which,-I suppose, iy open to argument, but personally i have always been of this opinion - that the best social reform whioh is possible would! be some scheme, worked fairly by both sides, by which the workman would get permanently as big a share of the profits of the industry as the industry oould stands     And I think it is possible that in previous times employers have got a bigger share than perhaps if one had the powers and the foresight of the Almighty would be given them-     But you have to look at the ! facts as they are now.     I havo taken a great deal of trouble to I get all the information which could be given me by the Board of Trade, and, what is also very valuable, I have had discussions with people, in whom I have confidence, who are engaged in business, and I do not think it will be contended by any competent observer that there are such profits&apos;now being made.   A great many businesses are being run - I do not say from philanthropic motives, though in fflany oases those do influence people - but because they think that in the long run it will pay them better, as indeed it does, to keep their works going even at a small loss, than to forego the possibility of making profits in the future by closing down. fon can put out of your mind any idea that the wages fund I have just mentioned can be got out of profits as things are.    What
is the other method?     It was said during the debates in tfi&amp;0 House of Commons that in the course of the war we spent millions on unproductive employment, and it was waked why we could not do that now, when we are facing another grave problem^     Well, you can only do that by borrowing money.   &apos; There is no other way and what is the result of that?     I do not hesitate to say that our situation as regards unemployment has been mr.de a great deal worse because, rightly or wrongly, not this Government only, but all Governments since the war, Game to the conclusion that in the long run the first essential to real prosperity was to pay our way and balance our Budget.   We did that, and if we had not done it, but had continues to borrow large sums in order to balance the Budget, there would have been much less unemployment.   But the view of the Government was that such a course would have had to be paid for by greater suffering after-wards.     Other countries have adopted a different system.     You know what has happened in Germany.   Apart from the present political situation, I was absolutely convinced that even if there was no political disturban.ee there must be a collapse in that country greater than we have seen anywhere.     I am certain that if, in order to meet your views, we wero now to borrow money, and employ it in any way you like so as to sot the stream of wages going, we should be permanently destroying the chanoo of getting back to normal conditions.Now, look at the other side.   No one who has given thought to this subjeot at all can help feeling what an ab-surdity it is that a man - the most valuable instrument of production in the world - should at particular times lose all value, while a hcrse always has value.     There is something absurd in that.   But now come to concrete proposals.     I have seen suggestions made for all sorts of schemes in which the State might take a hand.    What would be the effect of them? If the money is spent in the main on wages there is a great
149deal to be said for the scheme even though not immediately pro-fitable nor profitable so far as can be foreseen.     But in all the schemes v&amp;tloh you see constantly proposed) an amount of money would be required of which wages, it is true, would form a large proportion, but a large proportion also would not be wage expendi-ture at all*     This other expenditure would represent the cost of materials and so forth, not wages, and the result would be that as oomparefi with paying the dole - which 1 admit is about the worst system you could get - the total amount provided by the State would be a great deal higher, and our credit would tend to disappear and the possibility of getting into a sound financial position would go also.     let me take one case stated by Mr. Smillie, and perhaps one of the hardest cases.     I am Inclined to think that it is not the hardest of all;   the hardest of all is the case of tho young man or young woman just getting to the stage when employment could be given to them and finding no employment available,    I may say that we are trying to do something with regard to those cases, and we have made arrangements between the Board of Education and the Ministry of labour whereby the local authorities will be asked to set up oentres, and a number of schemes are being&apos; submitted.     But next to that, I think that the hardest case is that of the skilled labourer.     Suppose you start schemes which add to the burden of the Government in this matter, what would be the result on the skilled labourer? As regards all trades such as engineering, ship-building, ooal-mining, and everything which depends on world prices anything you do to Increase the cost of production of these things abcol-utely takes away the chance of employment for the skilled men engaged,    I was shown a month or two ago - I think I have quoted it before - a statement made by the Chairman of a big steel works in England.     That statement was that, apart altogether from Income Tax, which people might say did not affect the cost of production, the additional taxation and the higher rates sinoethe war
150had added 18/- per. ton to the oost of ell the steel produced in this country.     To whatever extent you go on increasing taxation you are handicapping these trades in their competition with the rest of the world&quot;   What does that bring us to?   I see no hope whatever - no hope - of any scheme that will give employment to the nhole of the unemployed   just now.     She same argument is raised on the other question of a higher so ale of wages.     It is quite true that there is always suffering, but it is fair to remember, as I am sure you do, that unemployed relief has never been given in the history of the world in any country on the scale on which it is being given in this country now.   She State is paying on unemployment half the total amount which was spent on running the country before the warQMR. SMI1LIE:   Are you speaking only of the Government1s share?THE PRIMS MINISTER:     It all comes out of the same pocket, whether by way of rates a? taxes.     1 repeat that the State is paying half the total amount which was spent on running the country before the war at the present time In unemployment. Suppose you were greatly to increase the rates of benefits     I am sure you will not misunderstand me;   I do not wish to sug-gest that workmen are worse or better off than other people, but if you pay a rate of benefit which gives them no inducement to seek employment, it is not in human nature to get employment. The position can only be met by increased taxation on those who have employment, and it will add to the burden of other workers and in turn injure their chances of getting employment.   What then, can be done?    The last Government made a very serious ef-fort to deal with this problem.     Since we have come in we have added to that effort.     We have at least   added 10 per cent to the number of men employed - that is to say we have added this number from the ranks of the unemployed.Now I come to your demand that the Houses of Parliament
,hou-](t meet.   The view has not been put forward in the speeches l made today, hut it has some currency outside, that Ministers are having while Parliament is not sitting., 8 complete holiday. I am sure the Members of Parliament themselves do not I share that view.   If you will forgive the egotism of it, I may if say that 1 have not been away for a day except when I was in Paris. My colleagues also are working quite as hard now as they do when the House of Commons is sitting.    It does not add to the effi-ciency of Government, it detracts from that efficiency, and makes more difficult our efforts to help unemployment, if the House of Commons is sitting all the time.   Look at what happened during the war.   There the country was faced with a sufficiently serious problem, but there never was a year during the war when the ad-f journments .?ere not far longer than they are now.    The amount of time taken up by the several Departments in meeting the parliament-ary exigiences of each day, the amount of work involved, in an-swering questions, which is one of the very legitimate forms of I democratic government., is very large.    It is absolutely essen-tial - everyone of whatever party who has been in the Government 1 has admitted it - that Government Departments should have time to II Prepare properly for the work of the coming session.   To call I Parliament together at the moment, instead of helping the situa-tion, would hinder it.    It is the result of not having the pressure of the House sitting that ,ye have been able to give more direct attention to measures for alleviating this evil.    I have myself seen a considerable number of people whom I should not have had time to see if the House had been sitting, and I have seen them ln the hope of stimulating some work for the benefit of the un-employed, and in some cases I have had successk    I cannot put it ^definitely,but we are in negotiation with the Port of London Authority, and if the works proposed are   carried out the result a 1 be that in six or seven weeks a thousand more men will be employed jm docs building.   re must have time if we are to go into these
1 8 %things care fully.After all it is only a month now before 2ax-lU &apos;* liament will meet in the ordinary course,   I can assure you, although I cannot expect you to agree3 but I know that Members who have been a long time in Parliament will not doubt,, that if I were to advise the calling of Parliament at the shortest notice - a week or so from now - instead of the problem with which we are concerned being assisted they would be hindered.I have only one thing more to say,   It is a very difficult situation, and in my belief the only hope for it is improvement in trade.   I had the view that there is a sign of improvement. I still think there is, hut the last time I said anything on this subject - I think it was also to a deputation - I added that what I most feared was European complications,   They have come, but even in spite of them I still think, that there is hope in that direction.   Mr, Smillie has spoken of his own trade.   I do not think he need fear for that trade.     The number of unemployed in it is, I suppose, smeller than in any industry in the country at this moment,   i hesitate to make the remark I am about to make, because it might easily be represented that I am longing to force wages down, end that is not the case.   Bat I have al-ways been struck with and admired the solidarity of labour &amp;a exemplified in those industries like ship-building and engineer-ing vhich have had their own wages enormously reduced and yet will help other trades in which wages have not been reduced to keep them up to the high level.   But if the level is higher than the state of the industry permits the net result is that the workmen who have had to have their wages lowered suffer by reason of the high cost of living which high cost is maintained because the other wages are kept upcMS. BPDM1EY:   It is always wages that you talk about. THE: PHEMB M1NISI3E:   I have said that if there were profits it would be quite another story,MB. SMIiLIE:   Do you say that there is not profit in the81c
raining industry? loday the mining industry is making very large profits.-JEB SRIiiB ivllITISTJE: I happen to have examined that indus-try very closely.   It is perfectly true if you take a li.ated area that there are particular pits which are making very big profits, but it is equally true that as long as the standard is not reached which we were discussing on a former occasion there can be no big profits for the industry as a whole.ME.31.111112: At the present time our figures for the . Scottish coal-fields show a very high profit per ton and the shares in the mining companies are going up in price very large-ly. She dividends in some cases are 30,35, and even 40 per cent.THE PRIME MINISTER-: - But you know that the agreement limits what the men got for every change to 83 per cent and what the masters : get to IV ;;er cent, Up to the time when the debate took place in the House of Commons there were a great many of these areas where the owners, instead of getting 17 per cent, had had to pay to keep up the standard.   It is impossible under that scheme that mine-owners as a whole should be mailing big profits even though here and there big profits may be made.It all comes down to this. 5Jc oro doiaa: what we can to get employment, and wo are doing all we can to restore sound finance. The economists all say that whatever we do we must not take the risk of loans.    It have taken the responsi;-bility of saying that if by lending money we could get immedi-ate employment - people set to work on the kind of employment we want - and did not run the risk of losing the loan, we should lend the money. More than that, all the schemes we are trying to push are schemes of really useful work that will return to the country indirect profits oven if not direct ones - I mean such schemes as road-making. v.&apos;o are pushing such schemes to the ex-extreme, and we have got, I think, 80 new schemes in hand. Thesep 9
will have to be-carried out by arrangement with the local authori-ties.   B7 tne central Government everything possible is being done.My last word is this:   the evil is there, we are doing our best to deal with it, and there is really nothing gained by for-getting - to put it mildly - the efforts which have been made not only by the Government but by Parliament to meet a condition of things which is quite as deplorable as you have described.     That is all I have got to say, gentlemen^MR. POULTON:   We have to thank you, Sir, for the statement that the Departments are working at full pressure to try and do something to relieve the situation.   It would be idle for me to say that we are not disappointed that we have not been able to convince you of the urgency of calling Parliament together, and we still hope that the pace may be accelerated at which this pro-blem, causing so much suffering and misery in the lives of so many of our men, women and children, is relieved, as a consequence of the Departments working at even higher pressure than they are doing at the present time.     I can only hope that upon looking through our statements and reflecting upon what my colleagues have said, you will see your way even now to advise the earlier assembling of Parliament, or at any rate that the schemes should be put in hands with great expedition.     I have one other re-quest.     This is a deputation of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress.     It may be within your knowledge that the Unemployed Committee have latterly been working with us in con-neotion with this matter.     They desired that they should form part of this deputation, but we told them very plainly that our clear understanding with you was that this was to be a deputation of the General Council of the Congress and we were going to keep to that absolutely.     This we have done, but the Unemployed Committee naturally feel very disappointed at the decision, and they have requested that we should make one further appeal to you as to whether you can see a duputation of that particular
1 c; T&apos;body in order that theymight place their views before you. If you could see your way we should be very delighted, and, apart from removing any friction which might exist, it would be all to the good of the movement,,TEE PPJME MINISTER:   Thank you very muoh0     I have said so much about the marchers in the House of Commons that there is no need for me to say anything more except that this is not a question-tion of my unwillingness to spare the time,     Before these bodies began to march to London - and I think we can imagine nothing more foolish than that they should waste whatever money they had and their shoe leather, to put it no higher, in coming to London merely to make a demonstration - I made the position plain, When I saw the deputation in Glasgow one of the members of that deputation, a man In my own constituency, said frankly that the demonstration was useful as propaganda against the present Conservative Government,     Well, in that case, you cannot expect me to assist it.     It is not that they expect to get anything from seeing me.     We have told them from the beginning that they could see anyone in the Departments-conoerned.     But they wish -excuse me putting bluntly - for the purposes of propaganda to be able to say that the Prime Minister refused to see them and that they compelled him to alter his decision.The Deputation then withdrew.
