[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmejit,^^ii 6 printed for the Cabinet._ / S--------.---.--- - , - .----..... -        / secret.CP. 47 (23).CABINET.STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE FOR EX-SERVICE QUESTIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of Stale for Air.1. With reference to the memoranda by the Minister of Pensions and the Ministry of Labour (CP. 4372 and 4373) as to the scope of the Standing Joint Committee for Ex-Service Questions, my view is, briefly, that the existence of such a Committee, desirable enough as a method of discussing the mass of questions, relating mainly to pensions and employment, which concern Service personnel discharged with rights under Great War Warrants, &amp;c, is not called for in order to deal with similar questions affecting the comparatively small numbers of professional personnel discharged under post-war conditions. Further, the remitting of questions affecting such personnel to a Committee of this description is open to objection on Service grounds.2. Post-war pension matters can, I think, so far at any rate as the R.A.F. is concerned, be conveniently and expeditiously dealt with in the normal course by the Department responsible. The question of employment in civil life for ex-professional Service men will be dealt with Ivy the National Association for Employment of Regular Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen and the various Committees working in connection with that body.3. At the same time 1 appreciate the desirability, from the Ministry of Labour&apos;s. / point of view in particular, of avoiding so far as possible friction with the British Legion in the matter, and am therefore prepared (although I doubt whether the practicability of such an arrangement has yet been effectively demonstrated) to accept the compromise proposed by the Minister of Labour for a period of twelve months if, and only if, the Legion are prepared to become a willing party to it.S. H.Air Ministry,January 25, 1923./[9415]
