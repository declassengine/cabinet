Referred to Committee of Home AffairsS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!s GOVERNMENT.CABINET. COST-OF-LIVING INDEX FIGURES. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.SECRET Publio attention has recently again been direoted3.P.62,(35)     to the Ministry of Labour oost-of-living index figures.The controversy involves two quite distinct pointei-(l)   The accuracy or otherwise of the index figures, ill)   The use which is made of these figures, when arrived at, in connection with regulation of wages.The issues are quite distinct, but are often oonfused. For the accuracy and correct compilation of the figures, my Department is responsible;     for the iuse made of the figures by employers or workers in their wage agreements, we have no responsibility.   It is probable that, when Parliament re-assembles, demands will be made for a Committee of Enquiry to be appointed.     I append a Memorandum in which the questions raised are discussed in some detail.(l)     As to the accuracy of the figures.It will be seen from this Memorandum that while there need be no serious doubt of the substantial accuracy of the present figures as a measure of the average increase in the cost of maintaining unchanged the pre-war standard of living of working-olass families,/it
gist January, 1923*it is becoming more and more desirable that a new index number should be computed on a more up-to-date basis. Before this can be done, a fresh investigation into working-class family expenditure will be necessary, similar to that undertaken in 1904 j     such an enquiry cannot usefully bo undertaken in the present abnormal condition of unemployment, but it is desirable that it should be put in hand as soon as favourable conditions prevail.(ll)     The use made of the oost-of-living indes figures in the regulation of wages is primarily a matter for employers and workpeople, but some observations on this point are embodied in the Memorandum.I propose that, with a view to meeting legitimate criticism, a convenient opportunity should be taken to announce in the House of Commons that, as soon as more normal conditions obtain, a new enquiry into working-class expenditure,  (i.e. Point (l) above), will be undertaken in order to provide a basis for the revision of the index figures, and I ask permission to make such an announcement.(initialled) 11, B*
THE COST-OF-LIVIIiG IKDEX FIGURES AMD^ TIIEIil ^APPLICATION IH THE REGULATION OF WAGES.Public, attention has again been f ooussed on the cost-of-living index figures compiled by the Ministry of Labour. On 17th January, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce adopted a resolution expressing the opinion that the regulation of wages by the oost-of-living index numbers, without reference to production, Is incomplete, and urging the Government to . appoint a Committee to investigate the present system of compiling the Index figures and the question of their application in the regulation of wages.   The resolution has aroused much discussion in the press, and will probably be followed, when Parliament re-assembles, by questions In the House and by pressure for an Enquiry.Controversies on this subject have arisen on previous occasionso   When prices were rising, and trade unions quoted the cost-of-living figures in support of claims for increases In wages, employers in some cases alleged that the official index figures over-stated the Increase.   On the other hand, when prices were falling, and employers quoted the figures in support of reductions In wages, the trade unions alleged that the figures under-stated the increase as compared with 1914.   The present revival of controversy is mainly due to the fact that the index figure has shown little change, on balance, since the summer of last year, having remained in the neighbourhood of 80 per cent, above the pre-war level.   It is now being quoted by workpeople as an argument against further reductions in wages, especially In the many industries in which the increase in money wages, as compared with 1914, Is less than the Increase shown by the cost-of-living figures.The resolution of the Associated Chambers of Commerce involves two separate questions.   The first of these conoerns/the
the accuracy of the cost of living figures;   the second, con&amp;erns the use to which those figures ara put hy employers and workpeople-in connection with the adjustment of wages,Iv ig^.jfB^fgQff.. Off .TJE^OQUMO%. Qg SHHSAlthough the figures have frequently been charged both with over-stating and with under-stating the actual increase sines 1914, no serious demonstration of their inaccuracy has bean attempted, apart from that produced in 1921 by a Committee of tha labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operative Union, which sought to show that the official index under-stated tha increase since 1914,   That report, however, contained obvious errors in arithmetic and in statistical proco-dure, and when these were corrected the results of the committee investigations agreed closely with the official figures.    On the other hand, two Departmental Committees and the report ef a joint departmental enquiry undertaken in 1920 for the Cabinet have borne witness to tha substantial accuraoy of the official index., for the purpose which it is designed to serve..   A few days ago, similar testimony was given by Dr. A,l. Bowley, Professor of Statistics at London University, in an article in the &quot;Times&quot;.Tha accuracy of the monthly ascertainment of the per-centage changes, in the prices of the various articles included in the official statistics does not appear to bo seriously dis-putad in any quarter; such criticism as arises is concentrated on the method by which these individual percentages are combined to yield a general average,,   On this point it may be explained that as the percentage changes vary considerably in the ease of different articles, it is necessary, in calculating tha general average increase, to allow for the varying importance of diffor-cnt items in the working class budget..   This is done by allotting/to
to eaoh item a &quot;w3ight&quot; proportional to its importance in pre-war working Class expenditure, as shown by the averages of near-ly 2,000 family budgets collected in 1904, adjusted in certain respects to allow for the slight changes which oocurrod between 1904 and 1914,So long as the statistics aro designed, as at present, to indicate the increase in the oost of maintaining unchanged tho pro-war standard of--living this method ia strictly accurate. As, however, the standard of living changes, with the lapse of time, measurements of the change in tho oost of maintaining the 1914 standard will diminish in interost and Importance, and It will become more and more desirable that the information provided should indicate tho amount of change in a present-day standard. It will, therefore, bo essential that at some future date a new index number, designed to measure the changes in the cost of maintaining a post-?/ar standard of living, shall bo substituted for that now current.So far as can bo judged the differences in tho index figures which would result from suoh a change would at present bo vary small.   This, however, is not generally appreciated and for this reason it is perhaps desirable that an up-to-date basis should be substituted aa soon as ciroumstancea permit. It is Impractioabla, however, to make the change at present, since no statistics exist as to tho present-day distribution of working-class expenditure. It would be necessary, as a first step, to undertake a largo-scalo and somewhat oxponsive enquiry in order to obtain a representative collection of working-class family budgets.   It would hava been ussloss to undertake suoh an enquiry during tho past two years, partly owing to tho rapid changes in prices and partly owing to tho abnormal distribution of working-class expenditure resulting from tho wldoapread loss of earnings oaused by unemployment and short-time.   In view of the present tondenoy towards greater stability of prices, It* 1 /appears
appears probable that the first of these obstacles may shortly disappear;   but, even so, until there is a considerable further improvement in the state of employment it will still be impraetic-able to obtain a collection of working-class family budgets sufficiently representative and satisfactory to servo as a gener-ally acceptable basis for a now index number.Nevertheless, it would probably serve to re-assure the more sincere and well-intentioned critics of tho present index number if an announcement were made that the Government recognise the necessity for a new index number, designed to show the changes in the; cost-of-living on the basis of a normal present day standard, in substitution for that now computed, based on a pro-war standard, and that as soon as favourable conditions obtain an enquiry will be instituted by the Ministry of Labour with a view to obtaining the data which are essential as a preliminary to the compilation of an index number on this basis.,     rt is proposed that at tho first opportunity an^announoemgnt to this effect shall &quot;be made in the House,II.    THE APPLICATION OF.TIE COST-OP-LIVING INDEX KTO31BS   IN   PECULATING   WAGES. &apos; The question of the application of the cost-of-living index figure in the regulation of wages is primarily a matter for the organisations of employers and workpeople who are responsible for negotiating wage agreements in tho various industries, In adopting this method they have been actuated by the desire to avoid repeated negotiations at short Intervals for the purpose of adapting wages to changing conditions but in no ease can it be shown that, in so doings the principle of fixing wages according to the capacity of the industry concerned to bear them has been abandoned. On tho contrary, reference to the facts shows that this has been the determining factor not only in the framing of the scales adopted but also in the changes made- from time to time both in the rates/of
of wages and in the scales themselves.   In no case .haa a scale been maintained unchanged.^ longer than has been JustifiedVbgjbhe conditions of tte^^^^^-SP^S6,^    fibere circumstances have so required special changes other than those justified by the cost of living scale have been made and, besides-, original scales have been altered with a view to accelerating changes In the wage rates.   She following are a few examples in illustration of this,(l) In the Tramways Industry the scale was recently altered from l/- pei week for 5 points to l/- per week for 4 points to be applied xetrospectively, involving an immediate reduction of 4/- per week. (2) In the Building Trade an additional reduction of l^-d, per hour was negotiated last year and a furthe^reduction is now under discussion.   Both of these sre outside the cost-of-living scale.(3) In June, 1920, railwaymen received an advance varying from E/- to 7/- additional to any advances due under the sliding scale agreement, owing to&quot;outside circumstances.   This additional advance has been wholly or partially withdrawn. In addition rates of pay for overtime, night work, special duty, etc., which are not covered by the cost&quot;of-living scale but are responsible for considerable additions to the wages bill are now the subject of negotiation with a view to reduction. Where the agreed minimum rates have been reached the cost-of-llving scale has ceased to operate,. (4) The Boad Transport employers are proposing to make a special reduction of 7/- per week apart from the cost-of-living scale,, In implying that wages in some industries are regulated solely oythe cost-of-living the Associated Chambers of Commerce appear to pverlook not only the actual practice of the trades concerned but also he&apos; fact that the rates of wages are determined by (a) tho amount of the/base
January, 1935.. tbase rate, (b) the number of points of movement of the index figure required to produce a change in wages and (c) the ampjant of the change of wage corresponding to the movement in the index figure, all of which are fixed and varied according to the circumstances of the trade.   So diverse aro these in the scales for the various trades that a change in the index number has a widely differing effeot on the rates in the trades and on their relation to the cost-of-living.Briefly the position is that while the cost-of-living index number has been taken as a convenient means of adjustment the various trades have maintained (generally   by variation of the other factors oi the scales, even to the point of suspension or abandonment)^ a close relationship of wages to trade circumstances.   If, therefore, the rates of wages appear to be too high it is due not to the existence of a cost-of-living scale but to the failure of employers and workers correctly to estimate the capacity of their trades, or the effeot of their own conditions on other trades, which are entirely different matters.If the basis of the Index Figure were changed it would obviously be necessary at once for employers and workers to reach new agreements but it would not follow that the actual rates of wages would be altered because they are not dependent upon the statistical method of determining the index figure, On the other hand, as the Trade Unions have never considered that the Index Blgure was just from their point of view, the negotiations thus made necessary would be difficult and would cause a considerable disturbance in the industries concerned at a time when interruptuon of production is least to be desired.
