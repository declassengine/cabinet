Slip, ^^^^1: &apos;   11 TOE CABINET.     . : &apos;f &quot;.    .THE MILITARY SITUATION IN CONSTANTINOPLE;MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The following memorandum has been, prepared by the General Staff on the; military situation which will arise at Constantinople in the event of the breakdown of the Lausanne negotiations ^       -The matter is so urgent and serious that i ask that it should, be discussed by my colleagues at the forthcoming Cabinet meeting.D.The War Office,3.0$ January-, 1923.General Harington, in histelegramNo.. 3515&apos; (attached as Appendix), asks fordefinite instructions as to the military policy the Government wishes pursued in Turkey after the Lausanne Conference breaks up. He states definitely that if the Turks refuse to sign, it is quite wrong to suppose that the British forces will be able to remain as at present.   The General Staff have never concealed their opinion (a) That under sucli circumstances the position of our troops at Ismid and Constantinople would be impossible militarily, and might result in a dangerous set-back, or at least an enforced withdrawal.(J) That the policy of the General Staff is, and always has been, to advise the Government to cut their commitments in the whole of the neighbourhood of Constantinople (including Gallipoli and Chanak) at the first opportunity^There is therefore no further advice that the General Staff can give; but they consider that it should be the immediate concern of the Cabinet to decide on a policy and issue instructions to General Harington, not only because of the danger of his position, but also because it appears that Lord Cureon, at Lausanne, has already committed the British Government to a refusal to leave Gallipoli unless the question of the graves is settled, arid he may possibly, for all the General Staff know, further commit the British forces to remaining in Constantinople for an indefinite period, while the Powders are waiting and hoping that the Turks may make up their minds to sign.The General Staff are firmly convinced that if the Turks refuse to sign, there wdll probably be a very short period of grace before the gravest incidents may occur in Ismid or Constantinople, which might compel an enforced retirement fighting a rearguard action ; or, worse still, force upon the Government, owing to public opinion becoming excited over losses, further military commitments which we are not in a position to undertake or to carry to a logical conclusion.It is playing with fire to remain a moment longer in Ismid or Constantinople than is absolutely necessary for the evacuation of the -troops, should the Turks refuse definitely to sign.It is, of course, necessary, if we evacuate Ismid and Constantinople, to retire accord-mg to plan to Gallipoli, and hold Chanak temporarily in order to permit of the orderly evacuation of the considerable amount of stores and heavy guns that we have on Gallipoli. All arrangements are made for this, and the General Staff do not anticipate that ah attack would be made on Chanak immediately, though they consider that the period of grace would probably not be longer than a month. A month would probably suffice to get I most of our impedimenta away.!        (B23/67)  100  1/23  W.O.P.   677
Whether or not General Harington would feel -he was able to carry out the evacuation of Gallipoli, and hold Chanak sufficiently long to ensure it, with his. present strength, aided by the Navy, or whether he would consider he could release at least three battalions now due for the East, should be a subject of immediate enquiry by the&quot;General Staff and General Harington himself.General Harington will, on receiving the Government^ definite instructions, no doubt withdraw the battalion now on the Maritza in time to avoid any complications.To sum up. From a military point, of view General Harington has not the military strength in Ismid and Constantinople to do anything but run the most serious risks should the Turks attack ; and it is quite impossible that we could reinforce him in time to be of the least assistance to him. It is therefore for the Cabinet to decide whether they consider such a grave risk is worth running, or General Harington should be ordered to evacuate Ismid and Constantinople the moment the Turks have refused to sign.We,therefore consider that General Harington should be told that, in the event of the Turks refusing to sign, he should evacuate to Gallipoli and Chanak, choosing his own time, and that he should be definitely instructed to run no military risks at all.The General Staff consider it of the utmost importance that, when the Government have made up their minds, they should immediately inform the French and Italian Governments of their decision.I hope that before Lausanne Conference breaks up instructions may be given me as to military policy the Government wishes pursued here. If Turks refuse to sign Treaty it -would be quite wrong to suppose that British forces will be able to remain as at present. It has only been by exercise of greatest restraint and conciliation that both Mudania and Lausanne Conferences were reached without conflict, and during last 2 months it has only been fact that both sides were waiting on end of Conference that has enabled us to avoid incidents. Peeling is none too good. Three of my soldiers have been killed and others wounded. Once the Conference breaks there may be more of this. I have definite evidence of Turkish plan 1o surround us here accompanied by plan of destruction of certain places by explosive. Angora has now been informed that everyone concerned knows his task and that all these plans are complete.We are in a thoroughly^ unsound military position here as I have often pointed out, and our position on Ismid peninsula invites attack. Delay is all in favour of the Turks who have initiative and time to perfect their plans while we, under the Mudania Convention, have to refrain from fortification and merely await a blow. To think that we still occupy Constantinople in a military sense is a farce. Constantinople cannot be effectively controlled by us unless we are prepared to seize reins of government and arrest Turkish officials and put in our own, and this would be a very large undertaking and impossible unless you are prepared to provide sufficient troops and guns to enable Ismid side to be held against Kemalist army which would certainly be put in motion. I have just recently inspected every unit in my command and no one could have a finer force, supported as it is by Navy, but unless reinforced strongly it cannot do all its present task indefinitely.There is no danger to French and Italians. They have their agreements and know quite well that Turks will direct all their energies against British. My considered military opinion, if we are going to have definite break or war with Turkey, is that our military force should be withdrawn from Constantinople and Ismid to Gallipoli peninsula, chanak being held as an outpost to cover our concentration on Gallipoli. From there we could sweep Turks out of Europe if necessary, which is what they fear most, as is evident from their anxiety the other clay when they thought we were going. It appears to me that to hold on here with three Guards battalions and one Marine battalion, which must be forced to evacuate if my three battalions on Ismid side are attacked by 50,000 Kemalists opposite them, gives Turks every chance of securing an initial success, which would be deplorable, and also necessitate keeping necessary shipping handy, and consequently great expense.Great strain is also imposed on troops who for past four months have been on outpost duties hi bad conditions. All units here are on field service conditions and always ready to move at short notice. We are, of course, prepared to do anything ordered, but I think we are running a grave military risk in remaining here if the Conference breaks down, and should withdraw at once to the Straits from which effective pressure can be brought to bear on Constantinople with help of the fleet.. This opinion has been held by me consistently for two years as expressed in CP. 29S1 of 26th May,This telegram has been shown to Acting High Commissioner and Admiral Brock both of whom agree.From Lieut.-General Sir Charles Harington to War Office.(No. 3515 cipher.)28th January, 1923.19.21.
