COMMUII-ISTSMoscow has sent to this country &amp; long manifesto., entitled &quot;To the Working men and Working women-of Town and Country&quot; urging the necessity for re-doubling efforts to secure a &quot;United Front&quot; and declaring that this is the chief decision of the recent World Congresses of the Communist International and the Bed International of labour Unions.&quot;...Unless ;;ou form this united Front you will be beaten in sections.   For that reason our Congresses resolved to strive in the first instance to bring about the unity of the industrial movement at all costs...&quot;The Reformist socialist parties and the labour leaders are acting on the direct instructions of the bourgeoisie, which is endeavouring to beat the working class in sections.   At the same time, however, they are endeavouring by cunning manoeuvres to deceive the working class...&quot;In England the leaders of the labour Party defend the British Government whioh is crushing Ireland with blood and iron...&quot;The labour Youth is with us...&quot;The poor peasants and agricultural labourers should maroh with us.     EEi IV Congress of the Communist International has imposed the obligation upon all Communist Parties to unite and organise the rural reserves of the Revolution, who in their struggle against the landlords cannot but come into conflict with the existing capitalist government.&quot;The oppressed colonial peoples are coming to our side...&quot;Our Congresses also discussed the question of fighting the most shameful thing of our day - the Versailles Treaty - and other so-called peace treaties. Against these treaties, which are supported by Vandervelde, one of its authors, against these treaties which the Stinnes Social-Democrats dare not attack, we have decided to conduct a ruthless war.Comrades!     Rise against these hellish treaties...At an enlarged meeting on December 6th, 1922, theBxecutive Committee of the Communist International decidedto publish a   second edition of &quot;The Communist InternationalYear Book&quot; in   Russian, German and Prench and has sinceinstructed each national section including the CommunistParty/

From East and West, from South and Horth they have handed together in Bed Moscow to report to the General staff, to review the activity of the past 15 months and to exchange the experiences made in order to apply them to the future work.   In the sixth year of the Russian Soviet Republic this parliament of young communists, held its sessions within the walls of the Kremlin, the only place in the world where communists can meet without heing disturbed.&quot;The Third Congress has not the task to take new decisions, this the Second Congress has done already.   As comrade ginoviev said in his final speech at the Pouxth Congress of the Comintern, when he summoned up the results of the Fourth Congress.   &apos; The Fourth Congress was a congress of precision, of concretisation, of study, it was not a congress which haa the task of formulating special new tasks, but it was the mission of the Fourth Congress to ooncretisise the decisions of the previous three congresses and specially those of the Third Congress, to shape them more precisely and in a more definite manner.1&quot;Our congress was in many respects similar to the Fourth Congress of the Comintern.   For us also it was not so much a question of taking new decisions of formulating new tasks, hut to precise and conoretisise the decisions of the Second Congress, to eliminate still existing misconception in the question of organisation and the structure of the Young Communist League and particularly in the question of the neuclei, to shape more clearly the Question of the economical struggle and the work in the unions, the question of educational activities and the anti-militaristic struggle.   And the congress had above all the mission to give practical directions for the day-to-day petty work of the Leagues in these domains...The Third Congress&quot;We/
&quot;We must learn to execute resolutions voted and decisions taken our Third Congress...&quot;Its up to one and all now to set to work and to build up through a stubborn and energetic day-to-day work in the workshops - a network of influence (as it is said very correctly In the Party Commission&apos;s report).     This means that we will have to transport the centre of gravity of our activities in the factories where we must set up our neuclei and so create continuous contact with the masses of young workers in mill, mine and workshop, i.e., on the point of production...&quot;The struggle against Militarism...&quot;The second Congress of the Young Communist International has dealt carefully with this question of the struggle against new wars and against tho plans of the Imperialists and the reactionary.   Great tasks stand before the working youth and the Young Communist league of all countries - and specially the countries directly concerned such as Great Britain - must pay the greatest attention to this important question...&quot;The Young Communists must become the champions not only of the oppressed in Great Britain of those who slave in mill, mine, and workshop of Merry England, but they must also be the standard bearer of the oppressed in Ireland and the other parts of the British Empire.   They must be the vanguard in the fight against the reaction and against Imperialism,   A call from the Youth of Britain to the millions of oppressed in the colonies must go forth and this call from the youth to the youth will have its echo in the masses of the colonial slaves, they will grasp the hands stretched across the seas by the young rebels of Great Britain and thus establish a fighting union, a united front of white and coloured slaves and together with the united front of young and old this united front will be the lever with which we shall overturn this rotten system, abolish Capitalism and establish the new society of communism...&quot;On December 20th the headquarters of the Young Communist league were removed from 55, Grayrs Inn Eoad, W.C., to 36, lamb&apos;s Conduit Street, W.C.   The league occupies three rooms on the second floor at a yearly rental of  100 payable in advance and two rooms on the third floor at a yearly rental of  50, payable quarterly in advance.     When these premises were taken over the necessary advance payment of  112.10.0. was paid to the agents/
COMMOHISTS AMD UHEMPLOYBiJThe following is a copy of a circular issued by communist headquarters &quot;to Party Committees and allunattached branches&quot; in connection with the unemployaddemonstrations on January 7th:&quot;Tin-employed Sunday&quot;The General Council of the Trade Union Congress has called on all Trade Councils and Local labour bodies to organise mass demonaorations throughout the country on Sunday nuz-j the 7th January to call attention to the urgent need for proper treatment of the unemployed.     It is of the utmost importance that every member of the Communist Party should identify himself with the demonstration in his locality and also to see that the Trades Council or ouher body    which has the matter in hand takes adequate steps to make the demonstration really effective.The line of action of the CP. members shouldbe:(1)   To stir up interest in the Trade union Branch, Trades Council, and other labour Organisations in &quot;Un-employed Sunday&quot;.(2)   To take part in the demonstration.(3)   To make the Party a prominent feature of the demonstration by displaying Party banners,   selling literature, etc.Wow that the un-ernployed have received recognition from this General Council it is more than ever important that CP. members should not relax the active part they have hitherto played in this movement, but that they should rather increase their vigilance so as to keep the General Council movement up to the mark&quot;.THE/agents &quot;in quite a careless manner&quot;.The Young Communist league is trying to establish an organisation similar to that of the Communist Party of Great Britain and in accordance with the Theses of the Second Congress of the Young Communist International: a comprehensive registration form has been sent out, the last item on which it:   &quot;Technical qualifications (Knowledge of printing, languages, nursing, military training, shorthand writer, typist, ate).
- e - -101^rrK JT1IBLIPLQ YJ3 the organised unemployed are most satisfied with the altitude of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress and other labour bodies and attach importance to the request of the Council to the prime Minister to receive a deputation:     some of the wilder spirits suggest that a general strike should be called with a view to forcing Parliament to assemble but at present there is practically no support for this proposition.On January 9th it was stated at the headquarters of the unemployed that reinforcements to the number of 6,000 or 8,000 might&apos;be summoned to arrive in London in time for the opening of parliament but this statement is largely bombast.Haye informed the secretary of one of the Glasgowcommittees on January 4th that,&quot;It is quite correct the marchers are not having too rosy a time, and although you and I are fully sympathetic with them, the real fact is that it is serving the purpose of agitation.&quot;It is estimated that between eight and nine thousand people attended the meeting held in Trafalgar Square under the auspices of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress, the London Trades Councils and Labour Parties and the national Unemployed Workers&quot; Committee Movement on January 7th.     Processions marched to the Square from various parts of London and comprised, in addition to the organised unemployed, representatives of a number of trade unions.Speeches were made from four sides of the plinth andfrom a platform against the wall at the back of the square:   the speakers were:George Lansbury, M.P. (from 4 platforms) J.B.. Williams (Chairman, General Council, TradeUnion Congress).Pre d/
Fred Bramley,,(Asst. Secretary, General Council,Trade Union Congress)W. Hannington,E. Friend, (Chairman, London Trades Council)D, Carmichael, (Secretary, London Trades Council)S. Saklatvala, M.P.,James Bromley, (Associated Society of LocomotiveEnginemen and Firemen)Tom Dingley, -. Griffiths,Henry, (Woolwich Trades and Labour Council)Eowarth, Y.L. HcEntee, Margaret Bond field, Robert Williams, (Transport Workers) C.W. Bowerman, M.Po, Councillor Gear, Battersea.The speeches call, for the most part, for little comment but emphasis was made on the necessity for employed and unemployed to stand together and satisfaction was expressed with the fact that a start had been made in this direction.Lansbury:&quot;There is only two ;&apos;ays of winning out.   You can have a bloody revolution - I am against that, because I think my way is the better way.   If you like you can capture every organised body in this country, and use it for the service of the people. Even the police are under your control once you capture that gas-house and turn it into a workshop... You sympathise with these marchers, don&apos;t you? You want them to have better conditions..   You cannot get it all at once*&quot;Hannington:&quot;We have at last succeeded in getting the Trades Dili on) Movement as a whole, to get into the struggle with tis against the Government, on the question of unemployment,     I recognise this.   How that the forces of organised labour have taken up the cudgels alongside of the forces of unemployed organisations, I realised then that now the struggle has started. How the united front has been formed, we have got to maintain that united front and march on to victory...nI am not a constitutionalist and I have never been a constitutionalist.     My attitude is, I will use the constitution when that constitution permits progress, but when the constitution stands m cm impediment, and an obstacle to progress, then I for one, shall advise the masses of the workers to kick over the obstacles of constitutionalism and become unconstitutional!sts...&quot;Here we have a splendid demonstration. Undoubtedly    the finest demonstration of solidarityever/
ever witnessed between the unemployed and the employed workers.   But it needs more than demonstrations to bring a reactionary Government of this description to its knees.   It needs action inside the Trade Union branches, inside the work-shops., inside the factories, on the railways and in the mines.&quot;Saklatvala:&quot;I put it quite bluntly and candidly that tho upper middle classes, with the governing class, and all the higher ruling classes are preparing for a revolutionary movement of a violent and physical character against the working class, and they want to conceal that fact.     They want the Parliament to shut up at a time when, in the history of Great Britain, a more critical time did not exist.&quot;Saklatvela then went on to say that they hsve given a Parliament to Ireland, where they were shooting men every week in the name of freedom;   a Parliament had been given to the workers of south Africa, where they were preserving law and order by hanging members of the working class;   and the parent of parliaments had now been shut up so that no inconvenient questions could be asked.The same remark applied to the other important events which were occurring all over the world - in the Hear East, in India and in Prance.   The Parliament was kept closed during all this time at the instigation of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers so that they could hatch in concealment the plans for the same movement which that wretched murderer Mussolini carried out in Italy.&quot;They want us to remain in ignorance of it &quot;by putting us out from the one place from which we can expose the trickeries and dishonesty of tho Cabinet Ministers of this country, who have been invariably the most dishonest persons in the country for the time being...&quot;They know that you are bodily weak and that you cannot assert your strength, and at that time thej are making preparations to fight you by violence.    In order to do that they v&amp;.ut to provoke you to a physical fight, with street riots, shop looting, and raiding empty houses, as the only means of your livelihood, and when you are driven to that you will be too physically weak to resist them when they send their forces of armed police to crush you...&quot;But we are no longer going to remain quiet and we shall know how to meet their bad policy.   If they provoke us into a fight upon their own battle ground that they have prepared, we shall not walk into the trap.   We.shall have to organise our own plans and have our own methods.&quot;We are told in the Eouso of Commons that the closing of parliament is due to the Royal prerogative, and that Ministers are not responsible for it...&quot;If/
- n -&quot;Parliament must act to limit this Prerogative, and that humbug of the Black Rod waiting into the House and shutting out the representatives of the people must stop for ever, lye demand it.&quot;James Bromley:&quot;I am glad to be here this afternoon at this vast demonstration to join my voice witli yours in protest against the House of Commons adjourning whilst millions of the workers in the country are starving.   I hope that every true hearted man and, woman will willingly support us in our determination to pull down the state which makes it possible for two millions of our people to starve for want of work whilst others live in luxury and idleness.&quot;Duncan garmichael;&quot;...We of the London Trades Council are not &apos; going to allow it to subside.   Prom this day until Mr. Bonar L&amp;w summonses parliament together to vote the necessary sums for building houses for the people, for putting land into cultivation, for setting the factories at work, so that we can get better boots, better clothes, better food for everyone, v/e are going to back up the Unemployed Organisation with all our might..,&quot;The following resolution was passed:-&quot;This Mass Meeting of workers and citizens protests against the action of the Government in declaring the prorogation of Parliament until February 13th, 1925.    We denounce this declaration of a prolonged holiday for legislators and regard it as a manifestation of indifference to the chronic suffering of thousands of men, women and children directly affected by the long-continued unemployment. We call upon the 5?rime Minister at once to take steps to summon Parliament to deal with this problem as a national emergency of vital importance, and we also call upon the Government to take such action as will-secure employment for willing workers, or the alternative of utilising the full resources of the State in order to provide a standard of maintenance such as will prevent the deterioration of those who continue to suffer the consequences of our industrial stagnation.&quot;This/
&quot;This meeting also urges individual electors to communicate personally with each member of Parliament representing their constituencies, calling upon them to support the terms of this resolution and to give effect to the decision of this meeting.&quot;Tho same resolution was passed by the , various provincial meetings regarding which the following numbers have been sent in by Chief Constables:Birmingham 800Coventry 1,600Dartford 800Edinburgh &quot;a good crowd&quot;.Loads (Afternoon) 1,500(Evening) 1,500Liverpool (extremists)        200Plymouth 200Salford 200Southamp t on 300Aberdeen 400&apos;Ihe iPinsbury Borough Council has refused to allow the unemployed to use the Taring Hall in Exmouth Street while the provincial marchers are in London and in consequence threats have been made to burn it down.A further contingent of 24 unemployed marchers from Clydebank reached Barnet on January 4th.There/
1.1?-5?There has been some friction between the Bouthwark Soard of Guardians and the Scottish marchers quartered in the local Union as the latter are averse to the proposal that they should be transferred to the Belmont Colony.Harmington has been asked by the Communist partyto stand for Parliament.   Speaking at an unemployedmeeting in the Town Hall, Poplar, on January 9th,Hannington said that it was possible that there would bewar in tho East in the near future and added:&quot;If they want you to carry a rifle, say to them rDo your o-m dirty work, and if we must carry a rifle then instead of shooting our own class in another country, we will use the rifles to shoot you1.&quot;IRISH BEVOIiUTIONARY ACTIVITIES Iff GREAT BRITAINIrish politioal activities in this country continue to be at a low ebb.   Irish clubs and associations are devoting all their time and attention to social gatherings and sporting competitions.   There is a marked renewal of interest in Irish athletics.     Peace talk is on the increase and a more hopeful tone is noticeable.A close connection appears to exist between the Clyde side&quot; Republicans and the Bolsheviks and arms are*, it is reported, being freely supplied from these sources. Joe Robinson, the Scottish Irish Republican Commander, Baid recently that he had never had such a supply.   His Bolshevist friend in Glasgow, referred to in previous reports is believed to be one Morris Maroovitch. Gurdit Singh Dara, an Indian Seditionist, isreported/
reported to hare said recently that he is in close touch with Irish extromists in London.Art 0&apos;Brien is trying to organise a nuraher of Republican meetings for January 21st.   The Irish Self-Determination League is reported to he badly in need of money;   the recent meeting at &quot;Essex Hall, Strand, resulted in a deficit.   A meeting of the extreme section took place on January 2nd at the Minerva Cafe, High Ilolborn, under cover of an ordinary Gaelic League meeting which was being held at the same time and place: about sixteen young men attended:   Art 0&apos;Brien presided.In Liverpool peter Murphy of 13, Scotland place, is trying to organise Republican Clubs.   He has applied to Joe Robinson of Glasgow for help to get into touch with leaders of the movement.On January 9th the Liverpool Police arrested three Irish Republicans and seized 7,500 rounds of &quot;45 revolver ammunition, six large revolvers, the fuse cap of a shell, two Galvanometers and component parts of rifles and machine guns.On the Tyneside the East Hewcastle bye-election is attracting a good deal of attention.   Mr, Henderson is not popular with many of the Irish voters and is being reproached with having acquiesced in the executions following&apos; the revolt of Easter Week, 1916, when he was a member of the Government.P.J. Little, Republican Director of Propaganda, arrived in Glasgow from Dublin on January 2nd for the purpose of starting a new Republican weekly to be called &quot;The Irish nation&quot;;   It riill replace Joe Robinson&apos;s &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;.A mysterious case of shooting was reported in the glasgow press of January 3rd.   Ho names were mentionedand/
Hiand no one was injured, and apparently, nc -one complained to the police.     The facts are that a member of the Terence KcSwiney Republican Club, named Plunkett, has been making enquiries about the movements of members of the local Irish Republican Brotherhood and Irish Republican Army and, as a   result, was suspected of being a Free state agent.   On the evening of January 2nd while in Ereadalbana Street, Glasgow, he was met by &quot;Ceptain&quot; Yihite, of the &quot;G&quot; Company, Irish Republican Army, and another man of the same company, and White immediately fired a shot which whistled past Plunkett&apos;s ear.   Plunkett threw himself on the ground and White, thinking he was dead, ran off.The new &quot;Rory 0&apos;Connor&quot; Republican Club formed in Maryhill is said to be doing well as is also the &quot; tact Mellows&quot; Club formed in Sword street.   Their principal business is propaganda and collecting money.   Any secret work is done by Joe Robinson and his Irish Republican foil Oflers,
