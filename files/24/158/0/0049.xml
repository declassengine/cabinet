&quot;Open LetterTo the lone!on and Vienna International and the AmsterdamTrade Union International&quot;On the 13th of this month the Executive of the Cormrranist International had addressed the question to you, aa to what you intend to do in order to carry out the decision of the Hague Conference regarding the organization of a general strike in case of a war. The Executive of the Communist International has empowered the undersigned together with Marcel Cachin, to enter into negotiations with you on the question of a common fight against the danger of war.     Owing to the persecutions to which the Communist Party of France, is subjected because of its struggle against the occupation of the Ruhr, and owing to his impending arrest, Comrade Marcel Cachin is unkble to participate in these negotiations.     The undersigned are awaiting your reply to form a joint Committee of Action with you, capable of taking up the struggle against the threatening war.At the Hague, the Russian Trade Union delegation proposed that an international protest strike bs called for the 2nd of January.     This would have demonstrated to the international bourgeoisie the determination of tho proletariat to wags war against the dangers of fresh wars.    At the Hague, the Russian trade union delegation predicted that January would surely see the occupation of the Ruhr,     Our warnings at the Hague fell on deaf ears..     Those present at the conference were satisfied with platoxtlc protests, in the belief that bourgeois diplomacy would find some way out.     But as we have seen these last four years, capitalist diplomacy has completely failed to create tho simplest conditions for the peaceful development of the world.     The occupation of the Ruhr threatens tho Tiorld with a new and unprecedented wholesale slaughter.&quot;The French plan aims not only at compelling the German capitalists to pay over money, but also to force them to admit French interests to the exploitation of these properties and thereby to add great numbers of cheap workers to tho low-paid labor army already at the disposal of Entente Imperialism.&quot;But this plan was based on the assumption that the French occupation authorities would bo able to supervise the Ruhr Valley to keep industry going and, by distributing or retaining the coal to force the German industry into submission.     But with the removal of tha German Coal Syndicate from Essen to Hamburg, the French plaa suffered shipcreok.     The French occupation authorities are helpless, and find it impossible to keep,the Ruhr industry alive^     Every succeeding day makes it more difficult for them topay/
&quot;We/u c -Jpay out the miners1 wages.     For this reason it is almost certain that they will reach out beyond the boundaries of the Ruhr Valley in order to tighten their pressure upon the German people.&quot;Already we hear of war preparations in Poland. France will sat her vassals against Germany.    But apart from all this avary moment is liable to bring a collision between the French troops sad the Ruhr population, in which case tho nationalistic spirit in Germany may reach its explosive point.     Should it happen that the French military elements will take advantage of Poincarers difficulties in order to drive him on towards the Rhine-S?o?3:don-Polioyt - the policy of dismembering Geinmany, - it may also well.bt that the chauvinistic elements in Germany will precipitate a war, in order to profit by the nationalistic oraae for the purpose of seising power by means of counter-revolution.&quot;Already the governments on either bank of the Rhine do not know what the morrow may bring..     On the 31st of January the situation will become jcoro acute, for on that day Germany will not be in P position to pay the sums demanded of her-     I&apos;as coiis:Jliiity then arises that the separate action of the Frrjea government may turn into a general later-Allied action. In that oase the German people may be faces, with the only alternative:    Complete subjugation and enslavement, or War.&quot;The Hague conference has decided that the proletariat would fight the danger of       with all means at its disposal, and that in case of imminent danger a general strike would be called.&quot;The danger of war is here,     Only the blind can fail to see it.     It is not only a question of war between Franca and Germany alone.     Such a war would set the whole East and South East of Buy ope ablaze. The capture of Memel by Lithuania and the events on the Roumanian-Hungarian frontier demonstrate clearly the aoutensss of the present situation, in which all forces tend to render every central JSuropeaa conflict, the starting point for a fresh European catastrophe.&quot;We doubt not but that the leaders of the Amsterdam Trade Union International,, as well as thosecf the Vienna and London Internationals see the situation in the same light as we do.     We therefore call upon you to lend reality to the solemn declarations which you have made at the Hague only a month ago, and to take the preparatory measures for the uhdelayed organisation of the mass strike.     We oall upon you to meat us without delay,  in order to decide upon the necessary steps to be taken.i&quot;The parties of the Communist International ana the working masses behind the Red Labor Union International will do their duty, as our French comrades have sufficiently demonstrated..
emirwp-JB?OjPoag, the 51st January bb the day when the intern&amp;tionaT protest mass-strike is? &quot;tbTegln.&quot;The duration of the strike must he decided upon -by the Join conference of three political and two trade union Internationals.     We propose that this conference he held on the 21st of January in Berlin. Should you prefer another place, we have no objection whatever.    We only ask you to .act immediately, so that tho undersigned may have ample opportunity to obtain the necessary visas.Berlin, January 16, 1923.FOR THB COMMUNIST INTERNATIONALClara Zetkin, Walton Newbold, Karl Radek.FOR THB RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSHeckert.P.S.     The other delegates, Comrade Tmdilieux, Hais end Watkins, oould not be reached until now.&quot;m OOMMDHISTSI i mum mi   p w - i   wii-The occupation of the Ruhr h&amp;s been the main the meat communist meetings during the past week end a leafletentitled   &quot;Stop the March to Ruin&quot; has been widely distributed, one South Wales communist group having offered to distribute 20,000 copies:   this leaflet concludes:&quot;Summon Parliament at once. Bring home the British Troops, Down with the Versailles Treaty.&quot;The resolution passed at various communist meetings in the Metropolitan area is as follows:&quot;That this Mass Meeting denounces the seizure of the Ruhr by the French;   Europe is on the verge of another war and calls upon the solidarity of the workers of tho world to oppose the war arafi demands the immediate assembling of the House of Commons;   the withdrawal of the British troops on tho Rhine and the repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles.&quot;J.T. Walton Newbold, M.P*, W. Gallacher, A. Inkpin,B** Peat and J.V. leckie have all been in Germany since thePrenoh occupation began and W. Gallacher states that while there he. addressed &quot;very many demonstrations in the RuhrBad Saxony&quot;:   he had no trouble with the German authoritiesaiad/
and supposed that the &quot;line he was on would be moreor less satisfacotry to them&quot;.     He had &quot;the other sids&quot;after him part of the time but &quot;managed to elude them&quot;:a further explanation of this episode was given in alater letter, in the course of which Gallacher wrote,after his return to London:&quot;r..Most of the time I was in the occupied ares, going from one place to another and it v/asn!t considered advisable to write-     On the Monday after my arrival I was tsken by French specials in Hamborn tustas I was leaving one hall to go to another.     They took me into a side room end several German comrades came in along with me.The French telephoned for their chief, but while they were at it the German comrades started jabbering and demonstrating end in the middle of the confusion I slipped off with one of them.     I had to tramp for more then en hour on a cold wet night to get to a place of security.     Meantime the Hotels were searched to see if I w-a3 in any of them.     At Cologne the platform was invaded by British officers and I though it was all up:   that they would pasB me over to the French, hut nof they were quite pleasant.     It&apos;s obvious that they are getting up against the French and to that extent sympathise with the communists.&quot;I got from the occupied area, to Berlin and was then despatched post haste to Saxony.     I had great meetings there in Chemnitz;. An&amp;, Annsberg. What7s more I could get them to understand me. I would fix up some deutchex frases before hand end slip them across them during the address.   It went all right too.     We had most enthusiastic meetings end ITve got to go b&amp;ck again.     The conference and the demonstrations were all that could be desired.&quot;There are signs of friction   at King Street between the former Party Commission and the other officials who so far have retained most of the money of which R. Palme Luti is endeavouring to obtain control.In connection with the organisation of the Coymuniefc Party on the lines of the Moscow Theses, it is reported that the membership of the Far Eftst London group has increased, within the last three months, from 83 to 176:similarly/
similarly the communist representation on the London Trades Council has increased from 6 to 15.Headquarters have sanctioned the formation of local Party Committees at Glasgow, Greenock, Eilmarnock, Motherwell, Vale of Leven and Alexandria hut consider that the present membership at Douglas Water is not sufficient for a Local Party Committee.     The Glasgow District Committee- expects progress with training and unemployed groups and also good results in Motherwell and Greenock:.On January 19th E. Palme Dutt, who is to be the editor of the daily communist paper next month sent the following letter to one of the leading Glasgow communists:&quot;The Party is building up its network of correspondents around ths paper in every fiirofition, both in the localities and in the Trade Unions end Workshops.     The Capitalist sources of   . -information do not give us what we want.     I am authorised by the Party to invite you to act as Correspondent for the national Union of Poim-dry Workers for the Hew paper.&quot;The new paper begins on February 10th, which means that we must start working for the first . number now.

It seems probable that future supplies will take the form of German paper, as the sheets are thinner and therefore more economical. tb4 YOUBC QOMMUSIST lEAGtffiThe organising secretary of the Young Communist league has informed the Berlin Bureau that the Socialist Youth Club at South Croydon has formed itself into the Croydonbranch of the League:   some of the 60 members have resigned, but the organising secretary considers that there are &quot;great possibilities in this locality&quot; for the league and draws the attention of the Berlin Bureau to this successful application of the United Front.THE/
THE UHBMP10YEDTho following circular was issued by the Council of Action on January 17th:&quot;To all branch secretaries.Dear Comrades,The Council of Action on instructions/from a delegate Conference of marchers-and London branches, issued this call for more men to take tho road to London to back up the comrades already here in their demand for an interview with the British Prime Minister.The General Counoil of the Trade Union Congress met Bonar Law yesterday and urged him to cull the immediate reassembly of parliament to discuss unemployment.   This Bonar Lav- point blank refused to do, which clearly indicates his callous indifference towards the problem.The Marchers are determined to break down this brutal attitude, and compel Bonar Laxa to listen to their grievances, and to move in the direction of immediate alleviation of the terrible poverty and destitution at present prevalent amongst two million unemployed in Great Britain.With this end in view the Marchers Council of Action call upon all branches of the national Uhumployed workers1 Committee Movement to immediately raise an army of reinforcements to march to London, and to arrive in London on the date Parliament reassembles, February 13th, 1923.The following is the plan to be adhered to for reinforcements:Birmingham will be the main assembling point for all reinforcements, and they must, arrive there on the evening of February 2nd, and leaving tho next morning.(b)   An array of picked men from amongst the marchers in London, and a number of London man will march to Birmingham to meet the reinforcements and 6o march back with them to London.   The London contingent will leave London on the morning of Wednesday 24th. and will arrive in Birmingham on the same date as the reinforcements February 2nd.(o)   In order to get the reinforcements into London on the Buy that Parliament opens, it has been found necessary on this occasion not to ack Scotland and the far Forth of England to send contingents as it would be impossible for them to arrive in Birmingham on the stipulated date of February 2nd.Tho other points at which contingents should converge and&quot;Call for arrive in PfellamentReinforcements to London on the day opens February 13ththe/
the dates of leaving are as follows:-Blackburn leave York &quot;Leeds &quot;Manchester &quot; Sheffield     &quot;Jen. 24th (Wecaesfiay)Jan.  4th       &quot;Jan.. 25th (Thursday)Jt;n. 26th. (Friday)Jan. 28th (Sunday)Obvitiingents should make for the most suitable point out of these, and arrive there the night previous to the date stated, so that they leave the next morning.Tho most essential thing to remember is that all contingents join forces in Birmingham on the date stated and leave the nest morning (February 3rd).From Birmingham to Loncon the route will be through Oxford, und any south Wales contingents can join the northern Marchers at Sfcatoes on the evening of February 11th.The following are.the conditions upon which men should be chosen for reinforcementsi(1)   All sen must be members of our organisation holding a card.(2)   B&amp;ch contingent must have a Chief Marshall, and strict discipline must prevail on the road and in London.(3)   The Marshall must send in daily reports to head office stating strength of contingent and whereaboutjs.(4)   Only men who are class-conscious and physically fit should come.(5)   Let it be quite understood that innumerable hardships will have to be endured, and no man should undertake the march unless ha is fully prepared to face these hardships without grumbling.(6)   The reinforcements must be given to understand that their hardships will not be over when they reach London-   It is in London now where the great struggle is taking place - a struggle not only for the right to state our  caaa and to point out the appalling conditions which are being suffered by the unemployed but an actual struggle for the common necessities of life for the marchers, as the Ministry of Health have instructed tho Local Authorities to mete out harsh treatment to the marchers with an endeavour to break their spirit and determination.   But we have so far beaten the Ministry of Health on this question.How comrades, rally to this call in your thousands.   We want the best of men who fully appreciate why they are marching, and who possess the necessary qualities that will enable us to win through.Bonar Law must be shaken out of this attitude of callous and brutal indifference, and he made to face the whole problem with concrete and effective proposals for an alteration/

At this thore were howls of execration and Zirby was fortunate in escaping c rough handling.     Richard purcell, of Woolwich, also spoke and denounced Kirby, the interrupter, as a traitor.   He denounced both British and Free state Governments in no measured terms and said the latter was doomed and would go down in history as the regime of &quot;Bloody Cosgrave&quot;.0&quot;Brian is playing an important part in the attempt to revive Irish discontent in thiB country.

He arranges and pays for the defence of all persons arrested for Irish political offences in this country and is the.chief distributing centre for all seditious propaganda.In his position as president of the Gaelic League he takes advantage of his opportunities to excite and influence young Irishmen against the Free State.
