Pj Jv) oi 00flOMMOfllSTS IN gins AMALGAMATED BNGIflEBBIHG TOflOHIfee luioashire District organiser has drawn up the. following interesting report regarding communist activities in connection with the Manchester District of the amalgamated engineering Union:&quot;Herewith a report of the &quot;Engineering and Shipbuilding Industrial Group Conference&apos; held at the A.E.-U. Institute, Kusholme Load, Manchester, on Saturday January 27th, and of the efficient way in which the comrades worked at the Conference.   I prefix the report by touching on the developments which preceded the conference.Prior to receipt of your letter containing copies of the A.B.U. Minority programme I had taken up the matter.   Some months ago a movement was started in the Openshaw 4th Branch A.E.U. for the establishment of a Vigilance-Committee.   Our membership is strong in this Branch and it wss fairly easy to win the Branch over to the policy.   Steps were taken to extend tha movement to other Branches of the A.ii!.U. in the locality.   It was subsequently learned that a movement of a similar character had been initiated in Levenshulme with Comrade J. Morton, late of Glasgow and of the S.L.P. as sponsor. i, joint meeting was arranged and a further section from Salford incorporated.   The Salford section included Comrades T* Cavanagh and R. France both of the Salford Branch CP.I asked the Comrades attending to press for the inclusion of the Altrincham Minority Group A.E.U. lead by Comrade C. Hoyle and they were ultimately invited and. Comrade Hoyle placed on the Provisional Committee. J. Morton and his Committee had somewhat prepared the ground for a conference by drawing up a manifesto to all kindred Branches.    The Manifesto was flamboyant but served to stimulate some interest.   We had good representation on the Croup the majority of whom by this time were CP. members.   At this moment I placed the Minority Programme which I had obtained from Comrade J.T; Murphy, in the hands of Comrades to get adopted by the provisional committee a3 part of the policy to be sent to Branches and discussed at the Conference.Unfortunately it was so clumsily handled by the Comrade in pn&amp;rgs of sponsoring it that it ran dangerously near being rejected.   However it was not accepted as a policy at the time and an Agenda Committee was set ireland to draw up a programme for the Conference.The agenda drawn up was full of packing and did not iy touch the vital issues which would attract masses of theengineering workers.   It was obvious that any steps to be taken must be to organise for the Conference itselfj so I typed out copies of the A.E.U. Minority programme and placed them in the hands of the D.P.C. Industrial Committee which by now had come into existence, togetherwith/
with a suggestion that they give the matter their immediate attention.   I sitpplied the names of fifteen   ; members who were attending the conference ana the Industrial Committee went through tho A.E.U. Minority programme and modified it and. made it cover the whole of the Unions and Trades which were likely to be represented at tho Conference.   Copies of the amended programme were ; placed in the hands of delegates and instructions issuGcl how to raise the matters and to vote.   I asked a Comrade to take a report of the proceedings and the following is one submitted by Comrade T*. Cavanagh of S&amp;lford (in charge of T.U. nucleus on Ind. Cttee).There were delegates present from 43.A.E.U. branches, 3 E.T.U. Eranches, 3 Boilermakers Branches, 2 Workers Union, 1 Patternmakers and 1 Sheet Metal Workers.The outline of policy contained in Manifesto was endorsed i.e. &apos;0ne Union for Engineering and Shipbuilding Industry&apos;.The second resolution constituting the delegates present as permanent groups entitled &apos;The Engineering and Shipbuilding Industrial Unionist group was also carrier.:.With reference to the next motion accepting en-bloc the present E.C. I mads a few enquiries and learned that the promoters had just before the Conference, decided to submit 8 names.   As 4 of these were members of the CP. and one of the others a strong supporter we gave our weight to this measure which was adopted.   In addition two delegates were elected from each of the following Unions:-&apos; B.T.U., Boilermakers, Patternmakers, Workers&apos; Union and Sheet Metal workers.   These with the above mentioned 8 will, constitute the E.C. of.the Manchester Movement.The questionnaire to which our polJcy was suggested as an amendment next csme before the Conference.   I learned that; the people who weie responsible for it were not averse to our policy and had suggested that it be placed before the meeting as a separate resolution.   I had a conversation with Comrade Hoyle and we agreed that no good purpose could be served by insisting that our policy remain as an amendment to Resolution 4 and that by acceding to this course we would remove any opposition and secure the passing of our programme.   We therefore had little difficulty in getting it passed and it was moved by Comrade Hoyle and seconded by myself as an addendum to the questionnaire.      Under new business I moved that:&quot;The 35..C. immediately consider the advisability of issuing a manifesto embodying the decisions and policy adopted by this Conference&apos;.     This was carried.Our bloc worked very well without it we should not have achieved anything like the successes which ws did.I forgot to mention that there were two fraternaldelegates/
delegates from Sheffield who informed me that our policy had been adopted by a similar conferenoe at     4 i Sheffield.1&apos;* Cuvanagh,rfrade Union Huolei B&amp;nartment.&quot;RED IJS^EHA&apos;1&apos;I0IUL Of LABOUR UHIOHSIn reply to a telegram received from Kalinin suggesting a one-day international strike against the occupation of the Ruhr ?rank Hodges cabled &quot;Miners International Federation does not take instructions from Moscow&quot;:     Kalinin has sent Watkins a copy of this reply which be terms &quot;cynical&quot;and &quot;insolant&quot;.The British Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions is concentrating upon the south V/alee coalfield where it is organising a oonferftnoS of the Minority movement:   attempts are also being made to stiffen the attitude of the south Wales Miners&apos; Jederation, the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Association and the National Union of Scottish Mine workers in regard to the termination of the present national agreement.Watkins anticipates a renewal of the American miners&apos; struggle in April next and, is directing propaganda against the alleged attempts of American coal owners to secure 2,000,000 tons of   British coal for various ports in the United States.The British Bureau is also taking a hand in the Building Trades Crisis:   a special meeting has been held to oonsider the matter and a factor of inrportance is that A.C. Cameron, Alexander Gossip and Tom Barron are all. communists, as is a Plymouth official named Earl, who has in I       the past worked for the underground department of theCommunist Party.     Moscow is watching the progress of the dispute with interest and wishes to be kept informed of developments/
developments. i f1THE YOUHG OOMOTHISI LEAGUSThere 1b evidence of increased activity among the officials of the Young Communist League, who recently sentto Berlin the following replies to a questionnairereceived from Moscow:&quot;Children&apos;s sections already exist in England. The number of sections is approximately 30, and there are about 1,200 children organised in the Communist Children&apos;s Groups.Nationally the communist children&apos;s groups are&apos; under the control of the Y.C.L.   Locally the section management committees are composed of members of the Party and the League, that is where branches of both organisations exist.One membor of the 3.C. of Y. C.L. acting as leader and three other comrades alecteO at a London Divisional Conference of Children&apos;s Sections.   The election of this committee took place early in October 1922, and after the delegates return from the congress of Leaders of Communists Children&apos;s Sections...One Divisional conference has taken place in Lonuon during the early days of October 192S...The decisions arrived at all centred around the Socialist Sunday Schools and v*ere as follows:1.     The conference decided that endeavours should be made to bring ah ont tho affiliation of the S.&apos;i.S. to the Y.C.I.2.     The conference then decided that members of the Party and the League must adopt a system of permeation within the S.S.S- in order to gain the realisation of the first decision-     There were present at this conference 31 delegates representing 16 sections.So dues are et the present levied upon the sections, but the ChildrenTs De2)artment of the Y*C.L. have under discussion the question of issuing membership cards for the children in our sections,, but a complete registration of our membership of our organisation is the first necessity-In the majority of cases the sections only meet on Sunday, the exceptions to this can only be found where the sections have     special branches of activity such as a choir, football team, etc     The meeting is conducted as ah ordinary public meeting, in many cases the children holding the principle offices.   The following is a typical agenda.The chairman opens the proceedings by saying Good Afternoon Comrades, this is repeated by thechildren/
ohi3t&apos;ro-ii.     The minuteE of the previous meeting are then read and this is followed by a revolutionary song .   The announcements are given and then the school ie handed over to a speaker who generally touches upon the different aspects of the olass struggle, after this another song and the section classes...A campaign for the permeation of the Socialist Sunday School movement has been put into operation and endeavours are being made to get a strong representation of communists at the annual conference of the S.S,S. which is to be held at Edinburgh on ;:pril the 1st and 2nd, 1923.Efforts are beln^made to get the children&apos;s sections to follow out the suggestions of the International conference of leaders of children&apos;b groups, such as th:i fight in the school, rambles, Kong evenings, and the teaching of the children revolutionary plays, poems, etc...No ohildren&apos;s newspaper is yet being published, hut now the financial position of the league is brighter, serious endeavours will he made to publish e children&apos;S paper.    (a report on this will follow later)...The socialist aujiday School movement is the only other proletarian children&apos;j; organisation in England.Thoxe are about 120 S.b.S. in existence but only about 80 of these are affiliated to the British Socialist Sunday School Union.     The approximate number of children attending the schools affiliated to the S.S.S. Union ia roughly 3,000, *mti the national body also claim that they have about 900 attending these schools.     The b.S.S. ie&amp;ue a monthly paper called the 1Young Socialist&apos; the price of which is 2d. and claim that thoy have a circulation of 2,500 per month.Their methods of work is identical with tho old conception which wt^s in being in the communist sections, of only gathering the children together on a Sunday afternoon.&quot;On jo.au..&apos;Xy 17th H. Young, the political secretary ofthe Young Communist Ici^uc, issued a secret circular tobranches in which he said that:&quot;At the present moment the activities of the communists working within the socialist Sunday schools ie seriously disorganised, and in order that the above body shall not fall into the hands of the reactionary elements, members of the Ptsrty and League must tyake an aotive part in all phases of this work.With/
With this view in mind the children&apos;s dept. of the Y. C.L. hfcve laid down various guiding lines for the use of members of the movement working within the Socialist Sundey Schools.Wherever a school exists, members of the perty and league must work on a basis of permeation from within, and endeavour to capture the management committee of the sohbol.   Any success in this respect must be reported upon immediately to headquarters of the Y.C.L.VJiwre no such school exists, members must endeavour to get up communist children&apos;sj groups, and success in this direction also to be reported upon,Vhorevor possible members must endeavour to get their committee to declare for the Young Ceranunist International, and should send this decision as a resolution to the S.S.S* national conference to be held on the 1st and 2nd -ir-ril, 1923.MemV-rs are instructed to oppose the proposition of a paid official being elected&quot;to the S.S.S. and this should also be dispatched as a resolution to the conference&apos;.&quot;In reply to this circular the secretary of the Brighton branch of the Communist P^rty has informed the national secretary that the local Socialist Sunday School   was formed and is controlled by communists:   he hopes that the elder scholars will form a branch of the Young Coramunist League in the near future6 -THE UffiilMPIOYSI)According to the information received from the Chief Constables concerned the contingent of unemployed marchers in the Midlands has received an addition of 12 men from the Manchester district, 7 from Stafford and 7 from Birmingham and has lost 12 of the Govan men who arrived at Birmingham on February 3rd:   they were in a wretched condition and were found by a police officer in a cellar known as the 1 Dug-out&apos;:   they were given a good meal of bread and cheese and their fares back to Glasgow were paid by the Chief Superintendent at Birmingham.The/
H[&quot;) Ai  3 &quot;a&apos;Jhe main body of marchers in the Midlands, numbering about 140, stayed in Coventry from February 1st to February 4th, when they left for Southam:     on their way through Rugby they raided the Workhouse stores and Btole twenty three pots of lam.    Hannington was arrested at Coventry for this theft and subsequently fined  ft at Rugby:   William Hunter who attacked the police who arrested Bannlngton was sentenced to two months&apos; hard labour.Hannlngton said at an unemployed meeting on theMarket Square at Northampton on January 29th:      ,When the gas-bag opened at Weetainster on the 13th February, they intended to see Bonar law. If they could not get their rights by constitutional methods, then they would by physical force.&apos;Ihe marchers in the south divided Into two sections after leaving Brighton:   one group of 86 in charge of Dingley and Gibson have visited Eastbourne, Hastings, Eye, Elham, Folkestone and Dover:   85 went   on to Ramsgate on February 5th leaving 1 in the Dover Union Infirmary.   !The other group whose numbers have varied from 83 to 87 and are in charge of tho Rev. &apos;T.3. Pickering and F. Stangroom, of Yarmouth, have visited Bust Preston, Chiohester, Fi;reham, Esstleigh, Southampton, Winchester and Basingstoke.   at Winchester the marohers expressed much dissatisfaction with the arrangements made at the Workhouse and adopted an insolent attitude but there was no actual disorder owing partly to police precautions and partly to lack of support from the local unemployed.Since the departure of the marchers from Brighton the looal unemployed have expressed their regret for tho conduct of the London men and have paid various trades people&apos;a accounts for food to the amount of  3.19.6.
February 3rd for London:   they are in charge of a hairdresser named Patrick tflynn, who is understood to be defraying the coat of tha journey:   these men arrived in London on Fobruary 5th and are at Poplar Institution.The temper of the unemployed marchers is sullen and it is probable that there would have been trouble in several districts, had the worlchouso authorities not been supported by the police.On February 1st the communist C.T. Pondry,   a leader of tho Eltham organised unemployed, was ejected from his house in Arsenal Road, Wall Hall:   Pendry and eight other men had barricaded the house, the front door of which was broken down by tho bailiff:   a crowd of about300 assembled but there whs no disorder.-IRISH REVOLUTIOHaRY -ACTIVITIES IH GREAT BRITAIN.Ixitjh organisations in Great Britain are bestirring themselves, organising concerts, etc., in view of the approaching Ifcsional festival:     the only two organisations that count - the Gaelic League and the Iriuh Self-Devorstiination League - are in the hands of the Republicans.In Liverpool and the north there are still a few active branches of the old United Irish league, but in Lciuon it is practically defunct.     The loaders of the Ancient Order of Hibernians support the Free State, but they have few followers among the ordinary London Irishmen,.Art 0&apos;Briwn is still busy arranging meetings and is hoping to secure the presence in Lent:on of the Countess Mfrkievics (now in Glasgow/ for a fortnight of meetings which are, he says, necessary to arouse interest.Art 0&apos;Brien&apos;s latest move ia to get one of his supporters to hire a publio hall ostensibly for a gathering of a social character and then turn it into a Republican meeting, distributing leaflets at church doors, etc.   Herrranged/12 unemployed men left Laith on the b.S. &quot;TeaO,&quot; on
arranged one at the Chelsea own Hwll for Friday nest (9th) but the Borough Authorities, on being informed, of the real character of the meeting, promptly cancelled the letting.A renurkable feeling of tension is noticeable in Irish olrclfis hero;   the Free skaters are depressed at the &quot;bKd news from Ireland&quot;;   while the Republicans are nervous and excited as if anticipating some big move.    All appear to agree that a critical time i3 approaching and that things cannot go on as they are at present in Ireland.It is definitely known that Republican activities in this country are on the increase.   &apos;ihe new &quot;officer commanding&quot; sent here some time ago has been visiting Scotland and the North of England for the purpose of putting the Irish Republican Army back on something like its old footing.   Recruits are being sought and new companies established in various centres, and all are being urged to become efficient and ready for any emergency that may arise.The Countess liarkievica is still in great demand as a speaker at meetings in Scotland,   she spoke in Dundee on February 1st; in Castle Street, Glasgow, on the 2nd; and at Parkhead on tho 4th.    A reception in her honour is to be held at St. Mungo&apos;8 Hall, Glasgow, on the 5th by the Cumann-na-mBan.The Republican organisation is considering the taking of now offices in Glasgow,, and premises in Jamaica street have been inspected:   the intention is to divide the offioe between the officials of the new paper and the Headquarters Staff of the Republican organisations.
