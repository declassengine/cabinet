[This Document is the Property of HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 54 (23).CABINET.ANZAC GRAVES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a message which I have just received from the Prime Minister of Australia.(Signed)        DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office, January 29, 1923.(Secret and Urgent.)Gallipoli cemeteries. Attitude of British and Allied Delegates in absolutely refusing to consider Turkish demands is most strongly approved by Commonwealth. Commonwealth Government desires to make it quite clear that in no circumstances can it assent to any of Turkish demands re Anzac graves. Should Turkish Delegation prove so unreasonable as to insist upon attempting to inflict this indignity upon Australia it ought to be made perfectly clear to them that Australia wili regard it as a casus belli. I do not doubt that a solid unyielding front by Allies is all that is necessary to induce Turks to recede from position they have taken up towards Gallipoli cemeteries. This we firmly believe we can rely on. But if unhappily it fails we desire to make it quite clear that Australia cannot give way in this matter. Hughes.[9438]
