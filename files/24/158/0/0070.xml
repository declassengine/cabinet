I i .  .(This document is the property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;a Government.)- C A B I N Eli / .home   AFFAIRS    COMMITTEE..   &apos; DANGEROUS DRUGS  (AMENDMENT) BILL. &quot; &apos; Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I circulate a draft Bill to amend the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920. I have considered the suggestion made at a previous meeting of the Home Affairs Committee that the Bill might be incorporated in.the Criminal Justice Bill, but think this course would be very undesirable.   The Criminal Justice Bill is a long Bill, the.consideration of which will probably occupy a good deal of Parliamentary time, and it will probably be some months, at the best, before it is passed,   For the reasons explained below,: the Dangerous Drugs Bill is urgently wanted and I am anxious to get it passed at the earliest possible moment.   It is almost certain to bo pressed for in the House of Commons when Parliament reassembles, and there is every reason to suppose it. will be- treated as non-controversial,The chief purposes of the Bill are (l) to give increased powers of search (clause l);    (2) to provide heavier penalties for bad cases (clause 2).   Both these provisions are urgently required in order to deal effectively with the large illicit traffic which is being carried on at the present time in morphine, cocaine, and the other drugs and preparations to which the Act applies^The existing powers of search (Section 10 of the Act) are very limited.   A constable or other person duly authorised is empowered to enter the premises of persons carrying on the business of a producer, manufacturer, seller or distributor of the drugs and to inspect his books and stocks of the drugs, but this does not help much in the case of the persons who are engaged in the illicit traffic.   It is necessary to have powers to search the premises, persons and papers of those suspected of being in illicit possession of the drugs or of being engaged in carrying on illicit transactions, whether in this country or abroad.   The action of my Department and the police in bringing to justice an international gang which is known to be carrying on this traffic on a large scale is being much hampered at the present time by the absence of these powers.As regards the other point, the penalties which may be imposed at present in the case of an offence against the Act are limited to a fine of  200 and/or six months imprisonment in the case of a first offence and a fine of  500 and/or two years imprisonment in the case of a subsequent offence.   These are very inadequate, whether regarded as a punishment orS-E C R E T. CP. 69 (23).
a deterrenti for the class of persons who are responsible for carrying on the international traffio in these drugs.    The transactions are on a big scale, the profits are enormous and the amount of mischief that is done cannot be estimated.     In a single instance recently, a man took out to the Par East 2,400 oz. of morphine, and 2,600 oz, of cocaine.    These quantities would represent several million doses,    France has recently adopted very severe penalties for this claBs of offence and the Council .. and Assembly of the League of Nations have recommended to the Governments to   consider the question of providing for substantial sentenoes of imprisonment.    The necessity for increasing the present penalties was pressed upon the late Government during the 1922 Session in the House of Commons,The remaining provisions of the Bill are of minor importance. Clause 3 clears away a difficulty .   which exists at present in the way of the supply of the drugs to duly qualified medical practitioners;,! and olause 4 removes a doubt as to the method by which the percentages mentioned in&apos; Seotion 5 of the Aot are to be calculated in the oase of liquid solutions. The British method differs from the Continental method and we are at present following the British method in the application of the Act,    The&apos;Bill would oonfirm this.W.C.B.2nd   February, 1923.9D.23-4
