I recommend that a Bill be prepared and introduced to give effect to the Majority Report except in so far as it relates to mortgages.     In this respect I recommend that the Bill should follow the &quot;Reservation&quot; made by Lord Onslow and three other members, and that all restrictions on dealings in mortgages should be allowed to lapse with the present Act,I have considered whether it would be better to proceed by way of an entirely new Bill or by means of a Bill continuing and amending the present Act,  and I have come to the conclusion that the advantage lies on the side of the latter course.     I appreciate the force of the arguments that may be,raised in favour of redrafting an Act which has given rise to so much dispute and that the plan I recOKrmehd may involve some legislation by reference^. On the other hand I would point out (1) that a continuing and amending Bill would be a comparatively short Bill, probably less than half as long as a new Act, (2) that there are manifest disadvantages in having to reproduce and defend long clauses, such as Section 2 of the present Act, which would be substantially unaltered, and (3) that there is a distinct advantage In retaining intact provisions on which legal decisions have already been given.A.G.B.5th Februaryj 1923.

Viscount Novar, G.O.M.G.My Lord and Sir,1. On the 25th July, 1922, we were appointed by your predecessors in office to be a Committee with the following terms of reference : &quot; To consider the operation of the Increase of Rent and Mort-gage Interest (Restrictions) Act, and to advise what steps should be taken to continue or amend that Act.&quot;  .On the 4th December, 1922; we were reappointed by you to carry on our inquiry. You appointed the Earl of Onslow as Chairman, in place of the Right Hon. Sir Henry . Norman, Bt., M.P., who was compelled to resign owing&apos;to the pressure of his private affairs; and added to the Committee Sir Ernest Hiley, M.P., and Lt.-Col. E. E. Fremantle, M.P. At the same time, the Hon. Alexander Shaw,.M.P., was unable to continue membership of the reconstituted Committee!2. Your predecessors had asked to, be furnished with an&apos; interim report on the general question of the continuance or discontinuance of the main principles of the present Act in time for submission to, the late Parliament - during its Autumn Session. An interim report (attached as an Appendix to this report) was accordingly presented to your predecessors on the 19th October; 1922. In this&apos;report it is recommended that protection of tenants against eviction, and against unreasonable increases of rent, as afforded by the present Act,&apos;should not be withdrawn when that Act expires in 1923. . In &quot;view of the &apos;fact that the reconstituted Committee, contained three new members, and that the terms of reference were unaltered, you informed us that we were not bound.by the. Interim Report furnished to your predecessors, but thatfif we so desifed.it was open to us to report upon the whole subject. We have!accordingly gone into the whole question afresh without, however, recalling any of the previous witnesses, inasmuch as The^new^membefs^wef^ provided with the Verbatim reports&apos; of. the evidence of-these witnesses. - .7. ....We should add that&apos;the particular&apos; situation created by We decision of the House of Lords in the case of Kerr v. Bryde has&apos; not been dealt (b 32/14)q a 2

The Building Societies&apos; Association (Mr. Enoch Hill). 4 A Questionnaire Form&apos;was sent to a selected list of those Associa-tions and bodies which might be expected to have special knowledge of the questions at issue. This form was as follows : 
(I) Whether the restriction of increases of rent should be continuedafter the expiration of the present Act. (2) If the restriction is continued, whether any alteration should be made in the amount of the increases permitted under the present Act.(3) Whether the restriction of the rate of mortgage interest should be continued after the expiration of the present Act.(4) If the restriction is continued, whether any alteration should be made in the rate permitted under the present Act.If the restrictions of increases of rent and of mortgage interest are continued, whether any alteration should be made as regards :  (5) The houses to which the restrictions apply. (6) The requirements as to notices of increase of rent and notices to quit.(7) The landlords right to recover possession, with particular reference to :-(a) the requirement as to &quot; alternative accommodation &quot; ;(b) other conditions on which the landlord can recoverpossession.(8) The position of &quot; one-house &quot; owners. (9) The position of sub-tenants.(10) The application of the Act to vacant dwelling-houses.(II) The provisions as to &quot; repairs.&quot;(12) The provisions as to &quot; key-money &quot; and premiums. (13) The provisions as to furnished lettings or lettings with attendance.(14) The mortgagee^ right to call in the mortgage. (15) Compounding for rates as affecting (a) The increases of rent allowed ;(6) The definition of net rent. (16) TKe effeot of rent restrictions upon the provision of new houses.(17) The effect of rent restrictions upon rating and assessment. (18) The provisions as to assessment of new houses. (19) Any other suggestions. Many of the replies given to the questions were elaborated in great detail, and were the means of putting us in possession of a most valuable mass of evidence. The replies received may be summarised as regards their source as follows : 13 Associations of Property Owners. 9 Associations of Tenants. 5 Trades and Labour Councils. 9 Legal Associations. 6 Technical Associations. 2 Government Departments. . 4 Housing and Town Planning Associations. 11 Local Authorities and similar bodies. 17 Trade Associations (including Building Societies).
. 12 Individual or Firms of Solicitors. ; 1 ,Citizens&apos; Association.        , ,In addition to this source of information, we have received over 4,000 letters from various sources, including in many cases elaborate statements of. experience by Estate Agents, Solicitors, Builders, Tenants&apos; Associations and individual tenants pr property:owners. The&apos;number-of letters given as having been received by the Committee does riot&apos; take into account a large number of letters addressed indi-individually to members of the Corhriiittee. We are also in possession of the views of the County Court Judges on some of the more contentious ppints of theAct, these views having been, elicited by a circular sent out by pur colleague His Honour Judge Sir Edward Bray.5. The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest.(Restrictions) Act came into force on the 2nd&apos;July, 1920,&apos;and remains in force, in the case of England and&apos;wales until&apos;the 24th June, 1923, and, in the case of Scotland, until the 28th May, 1923. It repealed the previous Acts on the same subject. Its general effect is to fix a &quot;standard rent&quot; for certain classes of houses, namely, that in which the pre-war rent or rateable value was not riiore than  105 in London,  90 in Scotland, and  78 elsewhere, and a &quot; standard rate of interest &quot; for mortgages on such houses; it prescribes what increases in the rent or rate of mortgage interest may be charged; and it.makes it impossible to dispossess a tenant or call in a mortgage, except in certain specified cases, so long as the proper rent or&apos;rate of mortgage interest continues to be paid.6. The evidence which has been presented to us on the. question as to whether or not the restrictions of the present Act should be con-tinued after June, 1923, is of a very conflicting character. That Act was passed because it was felt that in the absence of some protection, rents would be increased beyond the point which public opinion would have tolerated in the circumstances of the time. The increase feared would have been brought about by the two factors of scarcity of housing accommodation and the increased cost of building which made a commercial rent of new houses more than twice as great as the pre-war rent of existing houses of the same character. It was in essence a tenants&apos; relief Act. Obviously we have to consider its effect not only from the point of view of existing tenants and sub-tenants, but also &apos; from that of those at present unable to obtain houses, and not only from that of present and future tenants and sub-tenants, but also from those of the so-called landlord (especially the house-owner of moderate means) and of the mortgagee and mortgagor.In support of a continuance of the present restrictions it is urged that these considerations still apply to a not inconsiderable extent. The shortage of housing accommodation may be regarded as still acute, and although the cost of building has decreased greatly, there is still a wide gap between the rents of old houses, even with, the increases allowed at present, and the rents which would have to be charged for new houses if they, are let on a commercial basis. In addition it is urged that the prevalence of unemployment and the general fall in wages make even the&apos; present rents, a great strain on the resources of the working-classes, and in conclusion it is feared that numerous
evictions of tenants&quot; and subtenants might follow the withdrawal^ the present Act. This would cause grave unrest and would &quot;also accentuate the housing shortage.OnHKe other hand, we have been told that the only solution of the whole difficulty is an adequate supply of new houses, and it has been strongly represented to us that in&apos; spite of the fact that the present Act does not apply to new houses, this supply will never he forthcoming until all restrictions on dealings in house property are removed. This, it is said, alone can restore confidence in house property as an invest-ment. It is contended that in the case of the houses occupied by the working-classes, the removal of restrictions would in the large majority of cases mean no immediate increase of rents, because the present increases allowed to landlords, together with the large increases in ratesy make the total rent the maximum within their capcaity to pay.We have exa,min&apos;ed at considerable length the question of the influence of- the present Act on the provision of new houses. Before the war, private enterprise provided about 95 per cent, of the houses Built, the remaining 5 per cent, being provided by local authorities. During the war, scarcely any houses were built, whether by private builders&apos; of local authorities. Since the war, the bulk of the 200,000 houses provided have been built by local authorities with the aid of the Government, and private enterprise has been operative in few cases except those where it has been helped by a Government subsidy of a considerable sum per house. We haVe received evidence showing that in certain areas houses are now being erected by private builders without the aid of a Government subsidy, but these houses, like many of those erected with the aid of the subsidy, are of the villa type, and are erected for sale to intending occupiers, not for letting.This process of building only for purchase by intending occupiers is a post-war development. Before the war, the procedure which provided the bulk of the houses was the construction of a small number of houses, the sale of those houses to an investor, and the building of further houses out of the sale proceeds, and so on. The factors which have operated to drive away investment money from new house-property are both financial and psychological. In the first category comes the high price of building. Building costs have fallen very considerably indeed since the peak figures in 1921, and although they may go still lower, it is improbable that the further fall will he either so large or so rapid. All the witnesses agreed, however, that there is still a gap between the commercial rent of a new house and the rent which may legally be charged for a similar house erected before April, 1919. This factor, therefore, still operates, but the demand for houses at a rent rather than for purchase is so great that this alone would probably not deter investors from purchasing new houses from speculation-lative builders were it not for the psychological factor. This factor is, of course, the aversion to statutory control of any land, aversion which is the result of experience&apos; of control since 1915. The primary investor, the property owner, dislikes the prospect of increasing interference by the State in the relations between himself and his tenant; and both he and the secondary investor, the mortgagee, desire securities which
can be realised at short notice, especially if, as was the case to a con-siderable degree with investors in mortgages, they are trustees.The present Act, by making sale with vacant possession a rarity-has restricted the landlords prospect of realising his investment and by providing against the calling in of mortgages, has prevented liquidation-tion even in the case of death, and thus the winding up of many estates has been indefinitely delayed. Although it is true that houses erected since April, 1919, and money invested in such houses, do not suffer any disabilities of this character, investors feel that they have no security that future legislation will not bring those new houses under restrictions, and they point out that this has already been the experience.7. On the whole, we cannot but conclude that the Rent Restriction Acts, although their necessity in the past may not be challenged, have had an adverse effect on the provision of new houses. They have helped to prolong the shortage of accommodation which rendered them necessary, so that if the country is ever to get back to the position whereby the bulk of its houses is to be provided by private enterprise, the sooner all restrictions can be removed, the better.We are strongly of opinion that all restrictions should be removed at the earliest possible date, but we do not feel that it would be desirable to allow the present Act to lapse this year in its entirety. We recom-mend that it should be continued for a further definite period with such amendments as we suggest later. These amendments are designed to restore in as large a degree as possible the freedom of contract between landlord and tenant, and thus to restore confidence to the builder and the investor, and also to minimise the cases of hardship which would arise were the whole of the present restrictions to he allowed to lapse simultaneously. In short, our proposals are designed to provide a time for transition from the present state of affairs to a return to pre-war conditions.Our reasons for considering that the method which we propose offers the best method of getting rid of the restrictions are as follows :-(1) While the present acute shortage of houses exists, cases of hardship consequent upon eviction would arise, on a scale sufficient to cause great agitation and unrest.(2) The lapse of the Act in 1923 would probably accentuate the housing shortage in view of the number of sub-tenants who might be dispossessed.Although the complete lapse of the Act might stimulate private building, shortage would necessarily continue for some time, at any rate bringing with it its attendant hardships.We therefore propose that there should be a new Act under which certain tenants should be protected against unreasonable eviction and increased rents for a further definite period, which we suggest should terminate at the latest in 1925. During that period we propose that facilities should be given for as many houses as possible to be freed from the restrictions by unhampered arrangements between landlord and tenant.
Our recommendations are based on the view that a transitional period is necessary before we can get back to a complete freedom from restrictions. During this period it is hoped that a sufficient number of working-class houses will have been provided, by private enterprise,&apos; or by the State or by the Municipalities, or by any or all of these, to have reduced the shortage to a point at which the house-owners would no longer be in a position to demand and obtain excessive rents, and our suggestions have been framed with a view to assisting the achieve-ment of this object.Increases of Rent.8. The increase of rent permitted by the present Act is composed of all, or some, of the following : (a) For structural alterations (other than decoration or repairs), 6 per cent, on the outlay if incurred between 4th August,. 1914, and 2nd July, 1920, and 8 per cent, on the outlay if incurred after 2nd July, 1920. (6) In so far as the landlord pays rates, an increase equal to the increase in rates over the rates paid in the rate period including 3rd August, 1914, or the rate period including the date when rates were first paid.(c) An increase of 15 per cent, of the net rent.(d) Where the landlord is responsible for the whole of the repairs,an increase of 25 per cent, of the net rent. If the landlord and tenant share responsibility for repairs, the 25 per cent, is split up in proportion to their responsibility.The actual rent legally chargeable, therefore, is the &quot; standard rent&quot; plus the increase. &quot; Standard rent &quot; means the rent in August, 1914, or where the house was not let in August, 1914, the rent when it was last let previously, or in the case of a house first let after August, 1914, the rent at which it was first let. In any case where the rent is less than the rateable value, the rateable value at the appropriate date is tho standard rent, except that in the case of a tenancy where the rent is less than two-thirds of the rateable value, that tenancy is ignored for the purpose of calculating the standard rent. &quot; Net rent&quot; is the standard rent less the amount of the rates paid by the landlord.Tho increase of 40 per cent, of the net rent which is allowed by the present Act is explained by the Report of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Com-mittee as being arrived at as follows : 25 per cent, of the net rent to cover the increased cost of repairs. 10 per cent, of the net rent to enable the owner to pay the in-creased rate of interest of 1 per cent, allowed to the mort-gagee under the Act (two-thirds of the value of the house was assumed to he mortgaged). 5 per cent, of the net rent to give the landlord an increased rate ofinterest of 1 per cent, on his own capital. Provision was also made whereby if the landlord did not carry out his reponsibility for repairs, the whole 40 per cent, increase was suspended (see paragraph 13 of this Report).(b32/14)q&quot; a 3
Considerable difference of opinion existed among the witnesses as to whether these permitted increases should or should not be altered in&apos;any amending Act. On the one hand, we have been urged that it is necessary to allow a greater increase to the house-owner in order to put him in as good a position as before the war, and on the other hand, it has been suggested that inasmuch as the cost of repairs, and the cost of living generally have decreased, the increase permitted should now be reduced. It seems clear to us from the evidence sub-mitted that in the case of some houses in some parts of the country an increase would be justified, while in the case of other houses in other parts of the country the present increases are amply sufficient, and in fact in many cases have not been fully imposed.We have considered this question very carefully. It is clearly in the interests of all parties that no action should be taken which would discourage the provision of new houses. A decrease in net rent would certainly have this effect by widening the gap between rents of old houses and rents of new houses. A uniform increase of the present rents, while helping to bridge this gap, is hardly possible with the present widespread unemployment and falling wages. Possibly some tenants should pay an increased rent, but such tenants are com-paratively few in number, and they are certainly not the majority, of tenants at the present time. There is the further consideration that it is undesirable to alter the present increases permitted, which are familiar to all persons, during the remainder of the comparatively short period during which we recommend that restrictions should continue. On these broad grounds, therefore, we have come to the conclusion, that except in the case of a tenant who sublets part of his house, the increases should not be altered.In making the foregoing proposal we wish to make it clear without possibility of misunderstanding that we do not suggest that the prcs-ent maximum increase of 40 per cent, of the net rent is tho increase of rent which should reasonably be charged in all cases, or that the increase of rent which is now permissible under the Act should be regarded as representing in any way our view of the basis upon which the rent should be fixed when the restrictions are withdrawn. The moment the restrictions are withdrawn the statutory rent increases will ceAse and the settlement of rent should become entirely a matter of free bargain without any reference to the statutory rents which were chargeable during the periods of restriction. As we have stated above, in. a large number of cases the full legal increase of 40 per cent, has not been imposed by landlords. We do not wish to recommend anything which would affect this position.The Committee has had&apos;its attention drawn to the incidence of cost of repairs in the case of the tenants of colliery companies&apos; houses. It is alleged that the system by which the colliery companies charge the cost of repairs against the industry as a condition precedent to tho fixing of wages has had the effect of making the tenants pay a larger sum than 40 per- cent. We think this matter should be inquired into and corrected, so that the tenant is no cases shall dirctly or indirectly pay more than tho statutory 40 per cent, increase.
It has been strongly represented on behalf of the Scottish house! owners that in consequence of the different method of rating in Scot-land they are placed at a serious disadvantage as compared with English owners in relation to the 40 per cent, increase of rent allowed. Ia England the local rates are payable wholly by the occupier, whereas in Scotland they are levied partly upon owners and partly upon occu-piers. Thus in Glasgow in 1921-2, the rates were-On owners..      ..      ..   -......5,9. Zd. per  On occupiers      ..      ..      ...      ..      ..   8s. Id. per  while in similar circumstances in England the requirements of the rating authorities would have been provided for by a rate of 13s. lOd. per   falling wholly on occupiers.In normal conditions the Scottish owner would recoup himself by charging a rent sufficient to cover his part of the rate as well as the other outgoings incidental to the upkeep of the property, but he is prevented from doing so at present except in so far as allowed by the Rent restriction Act. The Bill-which afterwards became the Act of 1920 contained a clause to remedy this, as recommended by the Report of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee dated the 31st December, 1918 (para. 43), and as previously inserted in the Act of 1919, which the 1920 Act superseded. But this clause was so modified in the passage of the 1920 Bill through Parliament as seriously to reduce the equalising concession proposed to be made to the Scottish owner. The Committee recommend that this matter should receive attention in connection with any new Act.The houses to which a new Act should apply.9. The present Act applies to any dwelling houses where either the standard rent or rateable value is not more than  105 in the Metro-politan Police district,  90 in Scotland, and  78 elsewhere. The restrictions apply to any portions of a house let separately, and to a .ouse part of which is used as a shop or office, &amp;c.The restrictions do not apply (1) To any letting where the rent includes payment for board, attendance or use of furniture (except that profiteering is punishable by a fine); (2) To a house let together with other land or buildings, unless the rateable value of the extra land or buildings is less than a quarter of the rateable value of the house ; or (3) To any house built after the 2nd April, 1919, or to any house bom-fide, converted since that date into two or more self-contained tenements or flats. The rental limits in the present Act were reached by three stages. The Act of 1915 made the limits  35 (London),  30 (Scotland), and  26 (elsewhere); the Act of 1919 doubled these limits, and the present Act trebled them.A large number of witnesses have urged that if it is not considered feasible to remove all restrictions in 1923, it may at least be found possible to make a beginning in this direction. It is&apos; contended that the tenants of the larger houses are those in the best position to purchase(b 32/14)q a 4
their own houses; or to rent new houses at an economic rent; aridthat the&apos; effect;of-removingrestrictions from them will create a demand wliich will speed up&apos; considerably the building which is taking place at present, and which is mainly of this type of house. The building of the better class of house in any considerable numbers will allow of a moving up process which will help to relieve the pressure on the smaller houses/ We agree generally with these contentions, and consider that as control was imposed&apos;by: definite stages, the natural method of decontrol is by the same,stages. We therefore suggest that houses.in England and -Wales first included under the 1920 Act shoidd not be included in any new, Act; that at Midsummer, 1924, the restrictions should be with-drawn from houses in England and Walesfirst included in the 1919 Act, and that at Midsummer, 1925, all restrictions should lapse. In effect this means that an existing tenant of a house first protected by the 1919 Act, will have over 15 months in which to.make arrangements, either in the form of a new agreement with his landlord under the provision which we propose below, or by purchasing or renting another house. Tenants of the lower rented houses would have over two and a quarter years in which to make their arrangements.In the case of Scotland the corresponding withdrawal dates would be Whitsunday (28th May), 1924, and Whitsunday (28th May), 1925;Our next proposals under this head are also designed gradually to reduce the scope of protection. They are -(1) That when any house to which the Act applies is or becomes wholly vacant after the publication of this Report, it ski be withdrawn from the scope of the Act.(2) That at any time during the period of operation of the new Act the tenant of a house to which the Act applies shall have an exerciseable option to enter into an agreement with his landlord enforceable by both parties, for a lease of the house, the term of such lease (which may begin to run from any date to which the parties may agree) to extend beyond the date at which the new Act ceases to apply to the house, on any terms as to rent, &amp;c, which may be agreed upon; provided, however, that in the case of such a lease or agiec-ment in respect of a house which would remain under the protection of the new Act until 1925 the lease or agreement shall not - be valid until the landlord has obtained the approval of the Court.. With regard to the first proposal, we are of opinion that it will immediately lead to an increased use of the present available housing accommodation without inflicting hardship on any person. At present, when a house becomes vacant, the owner usually keeps it vacant until he can obtain a purchaser. He does this, not only because the rent which he can obtain from a new tenant is restricted, but because if he accepts a new tenant he cannot afterwards sell with vacant possession. Under this proposal, the owner who desires to sell will in the absence of an immediate purchaser be able to let the house on a tenancy termiii-able at. short notice, while he is awaiting a purchaser, , If he does
not desire to sell, he can let the house at whatever rent it will command, just as if it were a house erected since April, 1919,We confine our recommendation to the case of a whole house which is or becomes wholly vacant; we do not think that it could be applied to the case where a part only of a house becomes vacant.With regard to the second proposal, it will be seen that none of the existing rights of the tenant are taken away. He may still, if he chooses, stay on.as a statutory tenant under the protection of the Act, at the restricted rental, until the Act lapses asregards his house. . The proposal will, however, allow him, if he chooses, hut only if he chooses, to obtain security of tenure for a period extending beyond the period of his protection as a statutory tenant. At present he cannot do this, inas-much as such an agreement would be invalid in so far as the agreed rent exceeded the maximum legally authorised by the Act. Having regard to the fact that the tenant has the definite option of staying on as statutory tenant, or becoming a tenant under an agreement, it is clear that he is in a position to protect himself from any exorbitant increase of rent demanded as the price of the agreement.This second proposal, if adopted, will probably be mainly applied in the case of houses not of the working class. In so far as it is a step towards restoring freedom of contract between landlord and tenant, and so bringing rents nearer to the economic level, it will stimulate the supply of houses of this character ; and it must be borne in mind that the increase in the supply of this class of house will automatically reduce the pressure on working-class accommodation.The proviso requiring the approval of the Court in the case of agree-ments in respect of the lowest rented houses will confer a protection upon tenants of such houses who are not accustomed to tenancy agreements and might possibly be victimised under this proposal.We have carefully considered whether any alteration should be made in the provisions respecting business premises attached to dwelling-houses. In view of the proposed short duration of all the restrictions, the difficulty of discrimination, and the number of such premises which will automatically come out of the Act in 1923 and 1924, we do not recommend any alteration in the present provisions.We have received communications from the Brewers&apos; Society and certain licensing justices suggesting that licensed houses should be withdrawn from the Act; and we have obtained the views of the Licensed Victuallers&apos; Defence League, who suggest that, in the case of a tenant proved.to be an undesirable tenant by reason of a con-viction for such a breach of the licensing laws as would imperil the continuance of the licence, the landlord shall have power to apply to the justices at petty sessions or transfer sessions for an order for possession of the premises in question, the onus of proof to be on the landlord.It will be remembered that- the jurisdiction of the justices over licensed premises is extensive, and no transfer of a licence is valid without their consent; and, in consequence, we think that there is small chance of hardship by eviction being inflicted on a tenant, as the whole circumstances must come before the justices before the (b 32/14)q a 5
tenant can be displaced. On the other hand, with the Act as at present in force, the licence of the house may be lost or jeopardised from the misconduct of the tenant, and the owner has no power to obtain possession of the premises. We would, therefore, recommend that licensed houses should not come within the scope of the new Act.The landlords right to recover possession.10. Under the present Act, in order to recover possession, the landlord must make an application to the Court on one or other of the grounds (a) to (g) set out below, and before making an order for possession the Court must be satisfied that it is responsible to grant the order applied for.The grounds on which the landlord can apply are (a) That the tenant has not paid his rent or has broken the conditions of his tenancy. (6) That the tenant or someone living with him is a nuisanceto his neighbours, or has been convicted of using the house for an immoral or illegal purpose, or is causing the premisesto deteriorate.(c) That the tenant has himself given notice to quit, and the landlord has sold or let the house and would be seriously prejudiced if he could not obtain possession.(d) That the house is wanted by the landlord as a residence for himself, or for any person living with him or for some person employed by the landlord or by some tenant the landlord, and (except in the cases (i) to (iv) below) there is available for the tenant alternative accommodation reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects.(e) That the landlord of the house is a local authority or &quot; statu-tory undertaking&quot; (e.g., a railway company or water company), and the house is reasonably reqiiired for carrying out works authorised by Parliament, and alternative accommodation as defined in paragraph (d) above is avail-able for the tenant. (/) That the landlord became landlord after having served in the war and wants the house to live in, and offers the present tenant a sufficient number of rooms in the same house at a reasonable rent. (g) That the house is wanted for a former tenant who only gave it up to serve in the war.Where a landlord applies to the Court for possession of a house on the ground that he wants the house as a residence for himself, or for some person living with him, or for some person employed by him or by one of his tenants, the Court may grant an order for possession, even though no alternative accommodation is available, in the following exceptional cases: (i) Where the house was let to the tenant in consequence of his employment, and he has left that employment.
(ii) Where the house is required for the occupation of an agri-cultural workman whose work is necessary for the proper working of a farm or holding.(iii) Where the landlord gave up his house to serve in the war.(iv) Where the landlord became the landlord before a certain datevarying with the standard rent and the Court considers that greater hardship would be caused by refusing an order for possession than by granting it.We have heard a great deal of evidence, in parts very conflicting, with regard to relaxing the stringency of these conditions, but on the whole we have come to the conclusion that analogous provisions should he re-enacted. We suggest, however, that the following modi-iications should be made : (a) The definition of alternative accommodation. Under the present Act, when alternative accommodation is required to be provided, it must be &quot; reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects.&quot; These requirements are so stringent that in practice &quot;alternative accommodation&quot; is practically impossible to obtain. It has been held, for example, that where a tenant keeps lodgers, the alternative accommodation must also enable - him to keep lodgers; that the rooms in the alternative accommodation must not be too large or too small; that the accommodation must be in the same district; and so on. We consider that the Court should no longer he bound by this striugent definition, and that if the alternative accommodation is defined as &quot;reasonably suitable to the residential and other needs of the tenant and his family &quot; the Court could in many instances deal satisfactorily with cases where the alternative accommodation, although not exactly equal to the old accommodation, is in all the circumstances quite sufficient.It has also been held that the alternative accommodation provided must be available at the time when the order for possession is made, and not merely when the notice to quit is served. We have considered whether it would be desirable to provide that the alternative accom-modation need only bo available for a reasonable time after the date upon which the notice is given, but we feel unable to recommend this, as being likely to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous landlords.(b) The case of an owner requiring possession for occupation. This case has been most strongly urged on us, and we cannot but be im-pressed by the cases of hardship which have arisen, especially where a person owns only one house, owing to the inability of an owner to enjoy the occupation of his own house. . At present,, before he can obtain possession he must obtain alternative accommodation for the tenant, unless he became the landlord before the dates specified in the Act. We consider that this condition should be withdrawn in all cases where a house is required for occupation by the owner or his children, but, in view of the possibility of abuse, we think that this concession should apply only to those who have already become owners. We think, also, that there should be some discrimination between the owner who has been waiting for many months for occupation of his(b 3214)q a 6
house, and the man who has only recently bought his house.  We accordingly recommend : (i) that in the case of a person who has become tho owner of a house prior to 31st December, 1921, and who desires possession for his own occupation or for the occupation of t his children, he shall be entitled to possession without any &apos; conditions as to alternative accommodation provided that he has given his tenant at least three months&apos; notice to quit, such notice not to expire before 29th September, 1923 (or three months after the date of the new Act);(ii) that in the case of a person who became the owner of a houseafter 31st December, 1921, and before the date of publica-tion of this Report, and who desires possession for his own occupation or for the occupation of his children, he shall be entitled to possession provided he has given his tenant at least three months&apos; notice, such notice not to expire before 29th September, 1923, and the Court is of opinion that greater hardship would be caused by refusing an order for possession than by granting it.(c) WJiere possession is required for a whole-time employee. It has been urged that in such cases the present requirement whereby alterna-tive accommodation must be provided should be deleted. We do not feel able to recommend this. The relaxation of the stringency of the alternative accommodation required will help to relieve the situation somewhat. We consider that the entire deletion of the requirement in these cases might cause serious hardship in certain cases. We recommend, however, that the provision should be extended to meet the/case of a man who is not yet employed, but is about to be employed by the landlord or by one of the landlords tenants.(d) Possession required for agricultural workers. Paragraph 5 (1) (i) of the present Act provides that possession may be given, in the absence of alternative accommodation, where the Court is satisfied by a certi-ficate of the County Agricultural Committee, or of the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries pending the formation of such committee, that the dwelling-house is required by the landlord for the occupation of a person engaged on work necessary for the proper working of an agri-cultural holding.It has been represented to us that in many cases this paragraph -is inoperative inasmuch as it may be impossible to engage the man until he has possession of the cottage. We therefore recommend that this provision should be amended so as to provide for possession also in the case of a man to be engaged. In view of the fact that tho Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was - only empowered to take action until County Agricultural Committees had been constituted, it is worth consideration whether it is now necessary to continue to give this power to the Minister.(e) Possession required for carrying out loorles of improvement in the public interest. At present a local authority or a statutory under-
taking can obtain possession when it is necessary to carry out works authorised by statute, provided the tenant is found alternative aceom-modation. It has been strongly represented to us that this provision should be extended to meet the case of private persons and companies who desire to carry out improvements in the public interest, and also that the requirement of alternative accommodation should be deleted. We are impressed with the evidence which has been presented on this point, and which shows that many desirable schemes of improvement have been held up. We therefore recommend that this provision should be extended to cover improvement works carried out by any person or company where the Court considers that the carrying out of the works is in the public interest, but we consider that the provision as to alternative accommodation should be retained.(j) Possession when properly is being damaged by occupiers. At pres-ent a landlord can obtain possession without any question of altei-native accommodation when he proves to the satisfaction of the Court that the tenant or any person residing with him has been guilty of conduct which is a nuisance or annoyance to adjoining occupiers, or has been convicted of using the premises or allowing the premises to be used for an immoral or illegal purpose, or the condition of the dwelling house has, in the opinion of the Court, deteriorated owing to acts of waste by or the neglect or default of the tenant or any such person. It has been pointed out to us that this does not cover the case where a lodger or sub-tenant is causing the damage or nuisance, and in order to make this clear we recommend that the paragraph should be altered to include the tenant, any person residing with Mm, or one of his lodgers or sub-tenants. In order, however, to protect the tenant whose lodger or sub-tenant is damaging the property, it should be provided that the tenant is not to be evicted under this paragraph provided that he takes steps to get rid of his lodger or sub-tenant within a strictly limited time after the trial of the action against him by the landlord. Or it might be provided that the landlord should he entitled to take proceedings in the name of the tenant to evict the lodger or sub-tenant instead of taking proceedings against the tenant.It is, of course, understood that in all the cases dealt with in the foTe-going paragraphs, (b) to (/), no person shall be entitled to possession until he has obtained an order from the Court, and that such order shall not be given unless the Court is satisfied that it is reasonable to grant it.Mortgages.11. The present Act restricts both the rate of mortgage interest and the calling in of mortgages, as regards mortgages on houses to which the Act applies. We consider that so long as a house remains within the scope of any new Act, any mortgage on that house should be restricted both as regards the rate of interest payable and the right to call it in.Where, however, the mortgagee satisfies the Court that his security is seriously diminishing in value or is otherwise in jeopardy, or that for some reason, e.g., the delay in winding up an estate, hardship is
being caused by the inability to call in the mortgage, we think that the Court might be empowered to grant an order authorising him to call in and enforce the mortgage, subject to such conditions, e.g., as the payment of the principle by instalments, or otherwise, as the Court may think fit.Sub-tenants and sub-letting.12: The present Act is designed to afford to sub-tenants of un-furnished lettings the same protection as to tenants.The rent which the sub-tenant may be called upon to pay is based on the &quot;standard rent &quot; for the part of the premises which ho occupies, which may have to be determined by apportionment. An order for possession against a tenant does not affect the right of any sub-tenant to retain possession of his portion of the premises unless the tenant could not legally sub-let, or unless the sub-letting took place after the landlord had begun the proceedings for possession. In any case where the sub-tenant is lawfully left in possession, he becomes the first tenant of the landlord on the same terms as he held from the tenant who has gone.In practice, sub-letting is general in working-class houses. In most cases in England and Wales there is nothing in the terms of letting which prohibits sub-letting, or requires the landlords consent to any sub-letting, so that the great majority of sub-tenants are lawful sub-tenants, although the landlord may have no knowledge of their presence.We. agree with the general proposition that the sub-tenant should have the same protection as the tenant, and we therefore propose that in any new Act it should be provided that any lawful sub-tenant of a portion of a house to which the Act applies shall be protected against unlawful increases of rent and against eviction. Experience shows, however, that there are two grievances which demand a remedy. The first is the widespread practice of tenants demanding extortionate rents from their sub-tenants, which, although in excess of what is permitted by the Act, are apparently in many cases acquiesced in by the sub-tenant; the second is the fact that, when a house built for one family is occupied by two or more families, the wear and tear and, consequently, the expense to the landlord in repairs and decorations is increased.In dealing with these problems, the great difficulty is to avoid suggesting solutions which would have the effect of reducing the amount of sub-letting. With the present shortage of housing accom-modation, it is obvious that there must be extensive sub-letting if the pfeople are to be housed at all, and this fact immediately renders it impossible to accede to such favourite proposals as that sub-letting shall be prohibited in all cases except with the consent of the landlord.It is also an undoubted fact that tenants who sub-let part of their house do so to get more than the apportioned value of the part sub-let in order to compensate themselves for the inconvenience which cannot be separated from sub-letting. We agree, therefore, that as long as the tenant is protected against excessive charges by the landlord, the
sub-tenant should be equally protected against excessive charges by the tenant, but that at the same time tenants should be allowed to charge some strictly limited addition to the permissible rent of the part of the house occupied by the sub-tenant, and that the landlord should be allowed to charge the tenant some strictly limited addition to the permitted rent in order to recoup him for the additional expense entailed by extra wear and tear, or by structural alterations necessi-tated by the occupation of the house by more than one family. In order to check the present practice of excessive charges to sub-tenants, we think the landlord as well as the sub-tenant should he given the right to apply to the Court for determination of the permissible rent. As minor amendments to meet other difficulties we recommend : (1) That no tenant should have the power to sub-let or assign the whole of his premises to the same person for any period extending beyond the term of his contractual tenancy, so as to confer on the sub-tenant or assignee a right to remain after the determination of the term. This is not an un-common practice and is sometimes done for key-money.(2) That a tenant ceasing to reside on the premises shall retain no rights under the Act after the termination of his con-contractual tenancy, if he has sub-let the premises, and whether in one letting or in two or more.(3) That where a tenant gives his landlord notice to quit, the position of the sub-tenant shall not be affected. This is to meet the position created by a legal decision that the sub-tenant had no rights when the case falls within Section 5 (1) (c), the Court holding that the tenant in that pro-vision means not the sub-tenant but the superior tenant, and so defeating the general intention of the Act to protect the sub-tenant from eviction so long as his own conduct is not impeached.The landlords liability for repairs.13. Under the present Act, at any time or times, not less than three months after the notice demanding an increase of rent (except an increase for rates), the tenant can apply to the County Court for an order suspending the increase if he thinks that the premises are not in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation, or otherwise not in a reasonable state of repair. The tenant must satisfy the County Court, by a report of the sanitary authority or by some other means, that the application is well founded, and for this purpose he is, entitled to apply to the sanitary authority for a certificate. The address of the sanitary authority must be given in the landlords notice of the increase of rent. A fee of one shilling is chargeable on any application for a certificate, but if the certificate is granted the shilling can be deducted from the rent. Some sanitary authorities have refused to take action on receiving applications. They cannot be compelled.We have received very conflicting evidence as to the usefulness of this provision.   The witnesses who advocate its repeal contend
that the existing provisions in the Housing Acts give local authorities ample powers to compel an owner to keep his property in good repair, and that the present provision has merely led to litigation without any satisfactory results.&apos; On the other hand, it is asserted that a large number of landlords have not carried out their obligations to do repairs, especially in the case of internal repairs, such as decoration and painting, and that this provision is useful in such cases. On the whole, we think the present provision, should be retained. It is quite different in its nature from the provisions, in the Housing Acts. These provisions compel the landlord to carry out such necessary repairs as are scheduled by the local authority, or in default, the local authority can carry out the repairs at the landlords expense. The provision in the Bent Act, on the other hand, does not compel the landlord to carry out repairs, but in case of default on his part, it relieves the tenant from paying any increases of rent while the state of disrepair continues. In view of the fact that the greater part of the increase is allowed solely to enable the landlord to pay for repairs, we see no reason why this protection to the tenant should be withdrawn.Furnished lettings or lettings with attendance.14. The present Act does not apply to a house or part of a house, the rent of which includes payments for board, attendance, or use of furniture-ture, so that the tenant of such a house or part of a house can he turned out in the ordinary way when his tenancy expires. The Act, however, gives, protection to such tenants against extortionate increases in rent, by laying down the rule that the rent for a -furnished letting shall not exceed such rent as will show a profit of 25 per cent, more than the profit of the same letting in 1914. Any person charging an exor-bitant rent greatly in excess of this is liable to a fine of  100.These provisions are not used in practice to any great extent. We have received suggestions that the provisions should be repealed and that it should be provided that the permissible rent in furnished lettings should be the rent properly chargeable for.the house or rooms, if vacant, together with an amount depending on the furniture supplied. We consider, however, that this provision would prove in practice to be as difficult to work as the existing provision, and for that reason feel unable to recommend it. Neither can we suggest any other solution of the difficulty of exorbitant rents, different in effect from the present, whioh would not tend to discourage these lettings. We there fore recommend that the present provision should be left untouched as regards bona-fde furnished lettings or lettings with attendance; it provides a solution for exorbitant rents, if the tenant chooses to take advantage of it, and its presence probably has some deterrent effect.We should have recommended that some provision should be made to prevent a landlord escaping the restrictions of the Act by putting in a piece of linoleum or carpet or stove or some trumpery piece of furniture or arranging for some slight attendance, but in view,- how-&apos; ever, of. the very recent decision (26th January) in Crane v. Cox, which&quot; appears to &quot;put the matter on a sensible footing, it may be that
no amendment of the present position is required except perhaps in relation to attendance. ,...Key-money and premiums.15. The position under the present Act is that a landlord or agent is liable to a fine of  100 if he takes a premium or other consideration for the grant or renewal or continuance of a tenancy of any property to which the Act applies (other than a lease for 14 years or&apos; upwards), and any such premium may be recovered by the tenant from the land-lord. At the same time, any statutory tenant who tries to; obtain &apos;&quot; key-money &quot; in consideration of his giving up the house, from any person but his landlord, is.liable to a fine of  100.We have recommended that the tenant shall be free to enter into whatever arrangements with the landlord he chooses, as to the grant, renewal or continuance of his tenancy, so long as the new tenancy does not come to an end before the new Act ceases to apply to the house in question. Such arrangements might properly include a premium. The provision, therefore, requires amendment to meet this case. On the other hand, &quot; key-money &quot;is obtained by a tenant vacating his house and sub-letting it as a whole. We have already recommended that this be made illegal, but this only meets the position of the sub-tenant under such an arrangement. To deal with the tenant who takes key-money and leaves the sub-tenant in to be dealt with by the landlord, the provisions as to key-money should be retained.We also recommend that where a condition is imposed of taking furniture at an excessive price, the excess over a reasonable price should be treated as a premium. sThe assessment provisions.16. Two questions arise under this head, namely, the assessment of houses to which the Act applies and the assessment of new houses. Dealing with the first question, there is nothing in the present Act which specifically affects the assessment of houses to which the restric-tions apply, but as a matter of practice assessment committees have in most places restricted their assessments of such houses. This attitude will be affected by a case which was recently taken to the House of Lords (Poplar Assessment Committee v. Roberts), where the deci-sion seems to imply that statutory restriction on the rent of&apos; a pro-tected house does not entail a corresponding restriction in the :assess-ment. As a result of this, decision, assessment committees are left in some doubt as to the action which they should take. We regard it as important that the ordinary.principles of valuation which.are designed to ensure equality in the rating and assessment of all classes of property should not be impaired.In the case of new houses of the same class as those.under the Act, the present Act provides that their assessments shall be limited to the assessments on corresponding new houses which form, or might form, part .of a local authority&apos;s housing scheme. It has.been suggested to us that, this provision should be altered so as to avoid airy reference to Housing schemes^ a local authority and to&apos;make it&apos;clear that new
houses should be assessed on the same basis as similar pre-war houses in the same locality. This suggestion tacitly assumes that the assess-ments of pre-war houses should be kept down while the rents are&apos;kept down.In view, however, of the decision of the House of Lords already /. referred to, this suggestion falls to the ground.  We, therefore, recom- &apos; mend that the present provisions as to the assessment of new houses should be deleted altogether.Compounding for rates.17. In order that the increases of rent allowed under the present Act. should not take property at present within the compounding limits for rates outside those limits, the Act increased those limits, as regards compounding for the poor rate, by 25 per cent., except in the case of London. The compounding limits for the general district rates, which are somewhat different, were left untouched.As we have not recommended any alteration in the increase of rent permitted we do not consider that the present provision need be altered in any way.We do not consider, however, that apart from this alteration of the limits, the restrictions imposed by the Act should have any effect on the compounding allowances to which landlords have hitherto been entitled. The present position, as settled by the House of Lords in Nicholson v. Jackson (19 L.G.R. 512) is that in the case of compounded property the landlord is only entitled to claim from the tenant the actual increase of rates paid by himself to the rate collector and not the actual increase in the rates assessed on the premises. If the per-centage of compounding allowance is unaltered, this means that the tenant gains, and the landlord loses, part of the compounding allow-ance. As this allowance is paid to the landlord to recompense him for undertaking the collection of rates for the rating authority, and for paying some portion of the rates in advance, we consider that the landlord is entitled to continue to receive it.We therefore recommend that &quot; rates &quot; shall be deemed to mean the amount of rates assessed on the tenant, and that any increase in this amount shall be recoverable from the tenent, At the same time, &quot; net rent &quot; shall be the &quot; standard rent &quot; less the amount of &quot; rates &quot; so defined in 1914 or at the date when the &quot; standard rent&quot; is calculated. - .Restriction on levying of distress for rent.18. Under the present Act, a landlord cannot distrain for the rent of any property to which the Act applies unless he first- obtain the permission of the Court. On any such application, the Court has all the wide powers of adjournment, suspension, postponement, &amp;c, which it has in the case of an application for possession.We think that this is a most valuable provision and has worked in the interests of both landlord and tenant. We therefore recommend that it should be reproduced in any new Act.
Notice of increase of rent. (19. Under the present Act a notice of increase of rent must he in the form given in the Schedule to the Act, or in a similar form, and at least four weeks&apos; notice must be given, except in the case of an increase on account of an increase of rates, when only one week&apos;s notice is necessary. The Committee have had regard to the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of Kerr v. Bryde, but quite apart from the position created by this decision the requirements of the present Act have caused considerable hardship in many cases. It is often very difficult to fill up the form specified in the Act with perfect accuracy. For example, the &quot; standard rent&quot; is often im-possible to be determined accurately. Even with the best intentions, therefore, the form may have been inaccurate in some details. In such cases and they have not been infrequent when the case has finally come to the Court, the Judge has had no option but to decide that the notice was bad, with the effect that the tenant has been enabled to recover from the landlord all the increases of rent paid from the date when the notice took effect. This is clearly a hardship to the landlord, who has done, his best to ascertain the exact amount of the increases allowed. On the other hand, it is essential that a tenant should be in a position to protect himself against unauthorised increases of rent, and for this purpose he must be provided with the information as to &quot; standard rent,&quot; &quot; net rent,&quot; &amp;c, included in the Schedule.To meet this difficulty, we suggest that a notice of increase of rent shall not be required to contain anything other than the actual amount of increased rent claimed, although perhaps it might also contain an intimation that the tenant is entitled to obtain, on request of the land-lord, information as to how the increase has been calculated, including particulars as to the &quot; standard rent,&quot; &quot; net rent&quot; and amount of rates, or the obligation might be placed upon the landlord to give the information without any request. It should be made clear that the furnishing by the landlord of accurate particulars is not to be a condi-tion of the landlords right of increase, hut is to be an enforceable ohli-gation. It should also be provided that either landlord or tenant should at any time be at liberty to apply summarily to the Court for the determination of any of these matters without the necessity of an action which means expense, uncertainty in procedure, and delay.With regard to the necessity for a notice to quit, we think that there should he no room for the contention that a landlord can increase an agreed rent so long as the tenancy agreement is current; in our opinion it is necessary that the tenancy, if still in existence, should be deter-mined in order to support a claim to increase. We recommend, how-ever, that where a tenancy is determinable by notice, the notice of increase should be deemed to constitute a notice to determine the tenancy at the earliest date at which it could be determined.Recoverability of sums wrongly paid.20. Under the present Act a tenant or mortgagor may recover from the landlord, or mortgagee at any time after the date of payment any
sum which he has paid in excess of the amounts permitted under the Act.We consider that in many cases this provision inflicts hardship on landlords, who have in some instances been called upon to repay excess sums extending bach to 1920.Under the earlier Acts the right to recovery could only be exercised not later than six months after the date of payment, so that only six months&apos; excess payments could be reclaimed. If, however, our pre-vious recommendations are embodied in the new Aot this point will lose much of its importance, since inadvertence on the part of the landlord will then no longer operate to give the tenant a claim to refund of increases within the limits permitted by the Act, and we would not propose to limit the tenants&apos; right to refund of increases in excess of those limits.Determination of &quot; Standard Rent.&quot;21. As defined at present &quot; Standard rent &quot; means the rent at which a house was let on 3rd August, 1914, or where it was not let at that date, the rent at which it was last let previously, or where it was first let after 3rd August, 1914, the rent at which it was first let after that date. The present - definition has caused complications, difficulties and inconsistencies in determining the standard rent in cases not infrequent, where it is not shown that the dwelling-house was let as a whole, and at a separate rent, and with the same rights and privi-leges in 1914 ; for instance, in cases where it was let in parts and perhaps at different times or together with other premises or with or without Certain rights such as use of kitchen or stove or bath or garden or boxroom in common with other tenauts and which rights are of some value when included in the demise and now complicate the determina-tion of the standard rent.It is suggested for consideration that except in the most simple case, that is to say, where the dwelling-house is shown to have been let as a whole and at a separate rent and with the same rights and privileges in 1914, the standard rent should be the rent at which the dwelling-house could reasonably have been expected to let on 4th August, 1914. The determination of this figure would no t really occasion any difficulty, and the County Court Judge, or Registrar, could, if necessary, determine the figure without appeal, and it would get rid of all the difficult points that now arise in the varying cases and cause expensive litigation. But whether or not this is considered a satisfactory solution of the problem we strongly urge that some attempt should be made to deal with it.22. We are of opinion that all practicable steps should be taken to simplify the present procedure for settling cases of dispute, so as to provide if possible that a case might be heard and decided or a settle-ment arrived at before the relatively heavy costs of litigation are incurred.23. We think that a provision should be inserted in any future Act to prevent a landlord from having the power to exist a statutory tenant immediately on the lapse of the existing or any future Act as regards that tenant, without reasonable notice.

SUMMARY  OF   PRINCIPAL  RECOMMENDA-TIONS IN THE MAJORITY REPORT.1. That all restrictions should be removed at the earliest possible date, but that it is not practicable to remove all the restrictions on all classes of houses at once.2. That tire further period of restriction which is recommended should be regarded as in the nature of a transition period between the present time of full control, and the time when all restrictions are removed, and that accordingly the now Act should aim at the gradual withdrawal of control during the transition period.3. That in the case of England and Wales houses which were first brought within tho scope of restrictions by the 1920 Act should not be included in any new Act; that houses first brought in under the 1919 Act should be protected until Midsummer, 1924; and that protection should be withdrawn from the remaining class of houses at Midsummer, 1925. In the case of Scotland the corresponding dates would be Whitsunday (May 28th), 1924, and Whitsunday (May 28th), 1925.4. That the increases of rent permissible under the present Act should not be altered except in the case of a tenant who sublets part of a house. The position of Scottish house-owners, who are placed at a disadvantage as compared with English owners in consequence of the Scottish rating system, to receive consideration.5. That when any house to which the Act applies is, or becomes wholly vacant after the publication of this Report, it shall be witli-drawn from the scope of the Act.6. That at any time during the period of operation of the new Act, the tenant of a house to which the Act applies shall have an exercise-able option of contracting out of the Act by entering into an agreement with his landlord, enforceable by both parties, for a lease of the house, the term of such lease, which may begin to run from any date to which the parties may agree, to extend beyond tho date at which the new Act ceases to apply tb the house, on any terms as to rent, c%c, which may be agreed upon ; provided that in the case of a house which will be protected until 1925, such lease shall not be valid unless and until the landlord has obtained the approval of the court.7. That analogous provisions to those in the present Act relating to the landlord&apos;s right to possession in certain cases shall be re-enacted, but with the following modifications : (a) Alternative accommodation to be defined as &quot; accommodation reasonably suitable to the residential and other needs of the tenant and his family &quot; ; (6) An owner requiring possession of his house for his own occu-pation, or the occupation of his children shall, if he became the owner before the date of this Eeport, be entitled to it without any condition as to alternative accommodation, provided that he has given his tenant at least three months&apos; notice to quit, such notice not to expire before Michaelmas,
1923, and provided also that in the ease of a person who did not become the owner until after 31st December, 1921, the court consider that greater hardship would be caused by refusing the order for possession than by granting it;(c) In the case of a house, possession of which is required for an employee, whether agricultural or otherwise, the present provisions should be amended so as to apply not only to the case of a man already employed, hut also to the case of a man about to be employed;(d) The present provisions whereby possession can be obtained by public authorities and statutory companies to be ex-tended to the case of a private person or company carrying out improvement works, in cases where the court considers that the carrying out of such works is in the public interest j(e) The present provision whereby a landlord can obtain possessionif a person residing with the tenant is a nuisance or destruc-tive, to be extended to include the case of a destructive sub-tenant or lodger.In all the cases dealt with in paragraphs (6) to (e) an order for possession must be obtained from the court, and such order shall not be given unless the court is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so.8. That licensed houses should not come within the scope of the new Act.9. That so long as a particular house remains protected as regards rent, any mortgage on that house should be restricted as under the present Act, both as regards rate of mortgage interest and as regards the power of calling in the mortgage, but that the restrictions should be relaxed by leave of the court in certain cases.10. The position as to sub-tenants in houses to which the new Act applies shall remain substantially unaltered. So long as the tenant is protected against excessive charges by the landlord, the sub-tenant should be equally protected against excessive charges by the tenant, but at the same time tenants should be allowed to charge some strictly limited addition to the permissible rent of the part of the house occupied by the sub-tenant, and the landlord should be allowed to charge the tenant some strictly limited addition to the permitted rent in order to recoup him for the additional expense entailed by extra wear and tear, or by structural alterations necessitated by the occupation of the house by more than one family. In order to check the present practice of excessive charges to-sub-tenants, we think the landlord as well as the sub-tenant should be given the right to apply to the court for deter ; ruination of the permissible charges.Also,(a) No tenant should have the power to sub-let the whole of his premises to the same person for any period extending beyond the term of his contractual tenancy, so as to confer on the sub-tenant a right to remain .after the determination of the term;
(b) A tenant ceasing to reside on the premises shall retain no rights under the Act after the termination of his contractual tenancy, if he has assigned or sub-let the premises and whether in one letting or in two or more lettings ;(c) Where a tenant gives his landlord notice to quit, the positionof the sub-tenant shall not be affected. Tnis is to meet the position created by a legal decision that in such oases the sub-tenant had no rights.,11. That the existing provision whereby a tenant can apply to the court for a suspension of the increase of rent allowance, on the ground that the premises are not in a reasonable state of repair, should be included in the new Act.12. That the provisions as to furnished lettings, or lettings with &apos;. attendance should be re-enacted, but that there shoidd be some clearer definition of attendance.13. That the provisions as to &quot; key-money &quot; and &quot; premiums&quot; should be re-enacted (with modifications to cover the case of a lease under recommendation No. 6) and that where a condition is imposed of taking furniture at an extravagantly excessive price, the excess over a reasonable price should be treated as a premium... 14. That the provision in Section 12 (9) of the present Act relating . to the assessment of new houses should not be re-enacted,15. That the position created by the House of Lords&apos; decision in Nicholson v. Jackson should be altered. The benefit of the compound-ing allowance should be restored to the owner.16. That the provisions in the presemVAct restricting the levying of distress for recovery of rent should be re-enacted.17. That notices of increase of rent should be simplified so that on them the landlord need only inform the tenant of the amount of the increased rent he claims, but that the landlord should be bound to supply the tenant with particulars as to standard rent, rates, &amp;c, whether the tenant demands them or not. Any increase of rent which is in excess of the legal increase should be invalid only in respect of the excess.i 18. Attention is called to the serious hardships on landlords owing to the fact that under the present Act they may be called upon to repay excess sums extending back to 1920. Under the earlier Acts only six months&apos; excess payments could be reclaimed. If, however the pie-ceding recommendation is accepted, this point will, lose much of its importance, since a bona fide mistake on the part of the, landlord will only invalidate a notice for increased rent in so far as the increase, of claimed rent exceeds the permitted increase. Therefore no specific proposal to limit the tenant&apos;s right to refund of increases in excess of the permitted increases is put forward.19. -That an attempt should be made to provide machinery whereby cases may be heard and decided or a settlement arrived at before the cost of litigation is incurred.20. That, a landlord, should be prevented from evicting a statutory tenant immediately on the lapse of restrictions without reasonable notice.
*?RESERVATION AS TO MORTGAGES, BY LORD ONSLOWf SIR ERNEST HILEY, COL. WHELER, AND SIR AUBREY SYMONDS.We regret that we cannot concur in the views expressed by the majority of the Committee as to mortgages in the first part of para-graph 11.Having regard to the fact that the essential factor in the revival of house-building on the scale which it reached before the War is the attraction of the investor,we have considered most fully this question of the restriction on the callingrin of mortgages, and wei have come to the conclusion that all restrictions on dealings with mortgages should be allowed to lapse with the&apos; present Act.We have come to this conclusion because we are convinced that there is abundant capital immediately available to mortgagors with adequate security, so that although in some cases withdrawal of restric-tions might mean the calling-in of existing mortgages, a fresh mortgage could he obtained without difficulty and at a reasonable rate of interest. In this connection, it must be remembered that money is now com-paratively cheap,-while the value of house property,-the security, has advanced. Building Societies all over the country have very large sums available for mortgages. Although this process would mean in some cases that owners might have to pay a slightly higher rate of interest for a fresh mortgage, we consider that \ the decreased and decreasing cost of repairs will in most cases compensate for this.The greatest difficulty will arise in the case of mortgages secured on the lowest class of houses and on slum property on which it may be difficult to obtain a fresh mortgage of the same amount as the original sum. This difficulty, however, is bound to arise whenever the restric-tions are removed, and the difficulty will become, if anything, more acute the longer the restrictions are imposed. The fact that under the other proposals this class of property will continue to be subject to restrictions sd far as increase of rent and-right&apos;to possession are con-cerned will not affect the question inasmuch as this type of house is already let at the highest rent which can be obtained from the class of persons occupying it, and it has practically no higher value i when vacant than when occupied. It is not the class of house usually bought by a person for his own occupation. There is the further consideration that mortgagees of such property are not likely to foreclose with a prospect of losing part of their capital while their interest is safe.The great advantage which we anticipate would follow the removal of all restrictions oh mortgages is the revival of confidence in house property as an investment. It would leave the investor completely free to deal in old property as with new and should entirely remove the fear which is at present such a potent factor in diverting capital from house-building that fmther legislation-may extend the scope of restirctions to cover new property and new mortgages.(Signed)   * Onslow (Chairman). &apos;- ,,     ; Eenest V.Hiley.G.
