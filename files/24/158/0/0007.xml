THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.No.cabinet.Secret.       poor law emergency provisions (Scotland) act, 1921,CP.7 (23). Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.1.     Until 1921 it was illegal for Parish Councils (the Scottish Poor Law Authorities) to grant relief to the able-bodied.     In the Autumn of that year, however, cases of acute distress due to unemployment became so numerous and the machinery for dealing with them was bo inadequate that Parliament passed the Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1921, au&amp;horising the giving of poor relief to persona who are destitute and unable to obtain employment.     The Act, as its title indicates, is a temporary measure and unless renewed its provisions will finally expire on 15th May, 1923.2.     In my opinion the state of unemployment, as it is at present and is likely to be for some time to come, renders it necessary to renew the Act for a further period and I therefore aak for authority to introduce the necessary legislation to continue the Act until 15th Kay, 1924, i.e., for another year.3.     The Act placed on Parish Councils a heavy additional burden which they have shouldered with considerable reluctance and in many cases under protest, their contention being that the responsibility for dealing with a special but long continuing emergency such as the present period of unemployment should be a national rather than a local one.     They submitted repeated requests to the late Government for a grant in aid of their expenditure but without success.     These requests may be expected to be renewed with increased force when it becomes known that the Act is to be continued.4.     As this fresh obligation imposed upon Parish Councils was entirely contrary to the law and custom hitherto prevailing in Scotland, I feel that something will have to be done to disarm their opposition.   I have, therefore, submitted proposals to the Unemployment Committee for relieving the local burden, temporarily at least, by easing the conditions under which loans are advanced by the Goschen Committee and by giving sympathetic consideration to the suspension and possible remission of the annual loan charges in specially hard cases whether the loans are obtained from the Goschen Committee or from private lenders. With a similar object, I propose to insert in the Bill clauses -(a) enabling the repayment of loans raised to meet expenditure on the relief of the able-bodied unemployed to be spread over a longer period than at present.   (The maximum period is now 5 years with an extension in exceptional cases to 10 years.    Por these periods, I propose to substitute 10 years and 15 years respectively).(b) enabling Parish Councils to make arrangements with Local Authorities or with public Authorities approved by theBoard/
Board, of Health, e.g., the Leith Dock Commission, whereby the able-bodied poor may be employed on works of public utility instituted for the relief of distress due to unemployment.5.     With regard to (b) one of the grievances of Parish Councils is that they have to grant poor relief to the unemployed without being able to exact any work in return, and in that connection a considerable number of representa-tions have been received by the Board of Health.   I have much sympathy with the object in view which is to check the demoralisation which necessarily results from the continued receipt of relief without work and to provide something in the nature of a work test to be applied in doubtful cases. The Bill would, therefore, enable arrangements to be made to that end.6.     A draft of-the proposed Bill is appended and I shall be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet for itB introduction early next Session so as to allow time for the necessary stages to be concluded before 15th May.NOVAE.Scottish Office,Whitehall, S.W.1.January, 1923.
