D.    3.35.a.m. January 13th, 1923.       -       lit) K,    9.00.a.m, January 12th, 1923.14,    (R).----oOo----Following for Prime Minister from Chancellor of the Exchequer: Chairman indicated at to-day&apos;s meeting that commission would unanimously recommend and that Congress would, probably accept 1 interest at rate of .3&amp;  together with amortization in 61 years by I means of an accumulative sinking: fund at rate of half per cent per I annum payable either annually or in definite periods, e.g, every I five years.     For the purpose of calculating annual payment com-I mission have added, to outstanding principal (4075 million dollars) I Interest, which has been accruing tar the last, three years at 5t making total as at May 15th,  1922, of 4.686 million dollars.     Thus offer new made involves an annual payment of 187 million dollars for 61 years,In reply I said, that I thought His Majesty&apos;s Government would I in no case agree to this figure and that I had regarded as the m utmost I could offer, and that His Majesty&apos;s Govcrnmont could afford, annual payment of 140 million dollars for net more than 50 years. I&apos;added that I myself had considerable apprehensions as to our I ability to pay even this amount and that I had only extracted from you permission to go as far as this with the utmost difficulty. I Chairman then offered to halve rate of interest for the first five 1 years, balance of interest being deferred and added with interest I thereon to principal.     He pointed out that this ?;ould enable Great I Britaln to tide over the earlier and more difficult years.     I repliedthat even this was beyond my power to accept and that I must now I communicate details of their offer for decision of His Majesty&apos;a government.     vv*c accordingly adjourned in order that this might be done immediately.     Only other point on which any definite attitude &quot;as indicated is willingness of commission to recommend that debtor be allovsed option of making annual sinking fund payments either in cash or in United States government securities at par.

Sir ,ik*GfeddeB . thinks it possible . that C&amp;irdiiasioh; ban be Induced to recommend a 3%. rate interest plus half par cent sinking fund to extinguish.debt.in 66 years and that this, is most that we&apos;, can hope for.     Both, he and Governorformer on political and latter on financial grounds, regard an,agreed settlement as most desirable,    Farther above would represent better settlement than Treasury .believed to be possible,few months ago and a vast improvement on terms offered us under United States funding aot.Taking all thingn into consideration we are all three strongly - of opinion that we-should go as far as this and-I urge that I be authorised to make a definite offer on this basis firstly, in the hope   of securing an &quot;agreement / but if that prove impossible that we may be in a position&apos;of having made an offer that will appeal ts many Americans as. fair.-, If back interest is calculated as I beiiev3&quot;wai.,agreed by yourself in - .1918 this would involve a total annual -payment - of one hundred and sixty--four million dollars bat it is conceivable that Commission will.agree to re-calculate at 3$ compound,&quot;interest in which case this figure would be reduced -to one hundred-;-.and fifty-six - million- dollars per annum,. :   As.-regards question of;form I think, we can-.-obtain an option-to- redeem bonds at par at any&apos; time upon notice.    There remain- three questions of -subrcgated securities,&quot;marketability and&apos; possibility; of. obtaining&apos; a promise in the part of-&apos;    &quot;     &quot;  &apos; &quot;-&apos;.;,1  -;;&quot;     &apos;;   : &quot;;   1 ,&apos; /United&apos;&quot; &quot;&apos; &apos;&apos;

These are still -open to discussion hut it should he possible, to reach not unfavourable agreement rn. thesej once-main question is settled,.Shculd you accept, my recommendation I intend to -submit my complete proposals to. Commission in.writing and-in the event, of breakdown of negotations to publish them, in full as an earnest of Great Britain&apos;s good: faith.You will not, of course, forget terms of our original obligations as to funding viz.. on such terms and conditions as may be. required by. Secretary of United States Treasury,As we meet again an Sunday afternoon it is -essential that I should have your decision at earliest possible moment.
yellowing for Chancellor of the Exchequer from prime Minister.Your telegram 14*It is quite impossible that the British Governmentcould accept such a proposal as that indicated &quot;by you.Apart altogether from such considerations as&apos;that the debt was incurred in a cause for which America alsofought and that we should have had. no external debttheif we had advanced nothing to Allies frouyloans to us of the American - Government and if we had used our international securities before America entered into the war only for our own needs and has not employed them freely in assisting the Allies, the proposal seems to us harsher than in ordinary business would be employed by a Bank to a good customer.     Jjfo Bank in such circumstances would insist on a customer settling with the Bank until time was given to the customer to deal with the debts due to him.     In addition we should surely have the right to expect that as our debt to America could not be paid unless we were solvent the rate of interest charged should net be higher than that which would have to be paid to lenders on the jointsecurity nf the American and&apos;British Governments and ever a long term of years that rate of interest in all probability would not exceed 2%%.      If a settlement is- not attainable cn terms which seem-to us reasonable-, you have nc alternative but to ask for further time for consideration and to return.13th.January f 1923.II.Your second telegram just received.     It is impossible to call a Cabinet in time for your meeting to-morrow; butpersonally/
personally: I think the- rate of&quot; interest under the circumstances&apos; ou.&quot;ht not to ha mere than a$Ju..     If, however, you think they mifht remit the arrears of interest I would call a cabinet.net for IConday and if you still press it would recommend acceptance of pffer as so amended.     Bear in mind, however, that, as I believe we both think the proposal is most ungenerous, we might&apos; easily pay too big a price for a momentary increase of goodwill between the countries.,    I believe also that time is on cur side in this- matter.,     There would also be, the strongest possible objection tc making such a proposal unless it were certain to be accepted as it would be almost impossible to attempt to improve it in the future.     Per this reason if you are hot to succeed would it net be.better to end discussion on their proposal rather than commit ourselves to definite plan.13th January, 19.23..
