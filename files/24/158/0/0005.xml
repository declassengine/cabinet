Period ended December 29, 1922.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION. The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 18th December was 1,357,981, a decrease of 30,660 over the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The position in the Forest of Dean is now almost normal, and no further improvement is expected. Employment remains good in the Midlands, and steady in the Yorkshire, Durham, and South Wales coalfields. The improvement in the Lancashire coalfield has been well maintained, and the position in Scotland continues steadily to improve.IRON AND STEEL.There has been no material change in the general position in the Midlands and in Wales. In Northumberland, Durham and Yorkshire there has been a slight decline in activity, but continued improvement is reported from Lancashire and Cumberland; there are also indications of improvement in Scotland.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The improvement on the Tyne and Tees has generally been maintained, and the outlook on the Mersey and at Barrow is hopeful. In Scotland, the position appears to be slowly improving.ENGINEERING.There is no material change to record in the situation given in the previous report, but there appears to be a tendency towards improvement in most districts, particularly in the Home Counties.TEXTILES.Cotton. There has been no improvement in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the immediate prospects are not good.Hosiery and Woollen and Worsted. Employment in the hosiery industry in the Midlands and in Scotland remains normal. There has been no improvement in the woollen and worsted industry in the West Riding of Yorkshire, whilst in Scotland, although employment remains good in the Galashiels district, activity is decreasing in the Dumfries area.Lace. Unemployment continues to be severe in the Midlands, and there is no prospect of early improvement.Jute. The outlook in this industry is regarded as more hopeful.BUILDING.There is still considerable unemployment in most districts, more especially amongst unskilled workmen and painters, but improvement in the Home Counties, the Midlands and Lancashire continues.
BOOT AND SHOE.There has been no improvement in London, and employment has declined in Norwich. There has been no material change in the position in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire; employment has slightly decreased at Wellingborough, but at Leicester there are fairly encouraging reports as to the export trade.CLOTHING.There has been no material change in the position.POTTERY AND GLASS.In Staffordshire, unemployment is still severe, and has increased to a slight extent at a few centres. The glass-bottle manufacturing industry in Yorkshire continues to be very quiet.TINPLATEi.Employment in the Welsh tinplate industry continues to improve. TRANSPORT.Employment at the London Docks is subject to considerable fluctuation, and the improvement previously recorded as regards Avonmouth has not been maintained. On the Tyne and Tees employment has decreased, but on the Mersey there has been increased activity. Employment has improved at Barry and Port Talbot, but has decreased at Cardiff. At most centres in Scotland there has been considerable activity.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.I.-DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1. General Percentage of Unemployment.[Note.

On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, 19324] b 2 &apos;
which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow monev from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 19.20, to the 23rd December, 1922. 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later-measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Eeport. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 113,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local^ Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.
In September .1922., the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes assisted last year. All applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6). County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the S9jIIi6 8.S last winter. With the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications may be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 30tb November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government will be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :-Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...         ...        ....... 600,000Land Drainage         &quot;...         ...         ...         ...         ... 170,000.

The sum set aside for this purpose is, as stated above,  100,000.
