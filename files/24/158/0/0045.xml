this D0CI7MBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC ROAD PUMP;   Road Expenditure and Motor Car Taxation. (Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury) ?It appears to the Treasury that the time has come when it is desirable to hold an Inquiry to determine what, should be the. national polioy in regard to the finanoe of Road Expenditure and motor oar taxation.The Road Fund is an anomaly in the national finan- &quot; cial system.   The proceeds of motor oar taxation unlike&apos; the proceeds of all other national taxes are not carried effectively into the National Exchequer, but pass through it. to a Fund, the Road Fund, which is administered by the Ministry of Transport, and expended as to the greater part in grants to looal authorities based on a percentage of the *ost of maintenance eto., of roads in the areas of the local authorities; the remainder of the fund after bearing certain charges suoh as the cost of collection, grants to looal authorities in respect of the salaries of Surveyors is available for grants for the construction of new roads, the relief of Unemployment etc.The financial objections of this system d-an be realised by imagining tons extension to the rest of the national financial system. Suppose it were decided that the proceeds of other taxes instead of being pooled in the Consolidated Fund were   constituded into a number of separate funds,   each of which core the
chargee for the olaes of national e^en6iture&apos;most &quot;appropriate to it - e.g. the taxes on Drink, liquor licenses etc, to bear the chargee for Polioe, Prisons and tho administration of Justice the Income Tax the cost of Defence:   tho Death duties the Debt charges, ana so forth - it is easy to imagine the oonfusion that would result.    Some of the Taxes would produce too much and some too little; the Chancellor of the Exchequer would find it difficult if not Impossible to alter the rate of taxation on any one subject with reference to his general financial requirements; some of the services charged on the funds would languish for insufficient fundB, some would run riot with excessive sums at their disposal.    In short before long the whole system would be reduced to chaos and it is safe to predict that it would not be long before the country would be driven back to the sound plan of paying all taxes to a single fund and of balancing revenue and expenditure on a review of the situation as a whole.It may be argued that the motor taxes are applied to Roads as a result of a Parliamentary bargain, which could not be set aside without a breach of faith.   But it is a preposterous claim that any set of taxpayers are entitled to make binding terms with Parliament as to the application of the taxes levied from them.   The bargain suoh as it was, was made during another Parliament and with another Government;   and there can be no question that Parliament has full power to alter the rates of motor taxation and the application of the proceeds without the consent of the motor users.
Hie situation now arises that at a time when tha Chancellor will have the greatest difficulty in balancing hia Budget, when essential national Bervices. have to be severely out, and when the possibility of fresh taxation has to be seriously considered, the Road Fund has an Inoomo substantially larger than was estimated, and is able to undertake large works of construction *n an unprecedented scale.Even this exception to the normal rule of economy and restriction of commitments imposed on other Government Departments might be tolerated if the Road Fund authorities were content to live within their income.   But as the whole of their construction programme is optional expenditure and there is no limit to the programme of road expenditure for which a case can be made to the satisfaction of road enthusiasts, the Ministry of Transport propose to forestall their expenditure in future years, or to borrow on the security of the future revenue.   Instead therefore of being at the least a relief to the National Exchequer by reason *f its abounding revenue, the Road Fund will actually bo a borrower and a burden.In view of tho severity of unemployment it has been found convenient in the past to acquiesce in the Road Fund surpluses being used as a means of financing
tTj. &apos;.&apos;:) !T\ 0 ;. the situation now arises that at a time whan the Chancellor will have the greatest difficulty In balancing hie Budget, when essential national Bervices. have to be severely cut, and when the possibility of fresh taxation has to be seriously considered, the Road Fund has an income substantially larger than was estimated, and is able to undertake large works of construction en an unprecedented scale.Even this exception to the normal rule of economy and restriction of commitments Imposed on other Government Departments might be tolerated if the Road Fund authorities were content to live within their income.   But as the whole of their construction programme is optional expenditure and there Is no limit to the programme of road expenditure for which a case can be made to the satisfaction of road enthusiasts, the Ministry of Transport propose to forestall their expenditure in future years, or to borrow on the security of the future revenue.   Instead therefore of being at the least a relief to the National Exchequer by reason of its abounding revenue, the Road Fund will actually be a borrower and a burden.In view of tho severity of Unemployment it has been found convenient in the past feb acquiesce in the Road Fund surpluses being used as o means of financing
relief works - road construction being a convenient way of using unemployed labour.   But it is clear that schemes primarily adopted for the relief of unemployment should be schemes which give immediate relief through being set in hand at once, and which should not heavily mortgage the future by continuing into a remote period when, unemployment may cease to be a burning question*The propositions whioh I suggest ought to be examined by a Committee of the Cabinet are(1)   that the proceeds of motor taxation carried to the Boad Fund should be limited to say 10 millions per annum, any excess being retained in the Exchequer for the benefit of the general taxpayer:(2)   that the proportion of the annual income of the Boad Fund to be devoted to maintenance grants and to new construction respectively should be examined:(3)   that tho proportions devoted to maintenance and oonstruotion as between  rural and urban areas should similarly bo examined.   I observe that ihe Bating Reform Committoe in C.U.511 (page 5) suggest that some solution of the agricultural
rating difficulty may be found by an adjustment 9f the measure of assistance granted from the Road Fund in respect of highway expenditure in rural areas.25th January 1923.J.W.R
