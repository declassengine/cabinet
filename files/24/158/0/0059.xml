c[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.      January 1923.)SECRET:&quot; CP. 58 (23).CABINET.Legislature in India to remove Racial Distinctions in criminal procedure.In accordance with a decision of the Cabinet, the Government of India&apos;s proposals on this matter were considered on the 20th December by a Committee of the Cabinet, whose conclusions, if unanimous, were to be taken as final Cabinet decisions.I now circulate to my colleagues : (i) The minutes of this Oommittee&apos;s meeting, which are appended to this paper.(ii) The telegram, dated 21st December, which I&apos; &quot;sent to the Government ofIndia in pursuance of their conclusions.(iii) A telegram dated 29th December giving the sanction of the Secretary ofState in Council, which is required by law, to the proposed legislation.(iv) A telegram, from tlie Government of India, dated 13th January, asking forthe modification of these decisions in certain particulars, and making certain final proposals on other points in modification of their own original proposals.The terms of the telegram dated 21th January (also appended), which I sent to the Government of India in answer to theirs Of the 21-th, were settled, with the concurrence of my colleagues of the Cabinet Committee, so far as the three points affecting the decisions given in my telegram of 21st December were concerned.PEEL.29th January 1923.Telegram from Secretary of Slate to Government of India, Home Department,dated 21st December 1922.Racial Distinctions Proposals.His Majesty&apos;s Government agree to publication of Report and introduction of Bill in January session to carry out the proposals contained in Committee&apos;s Report, subject to following three reservations : First. Definition of European British Subject. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that existing definition in section &amp; (1) (i) of Code must be amended, but cannot agree to any form of amendment which will exclude from definition persons born, naturalised or domiciled in Dominions or Colonies. Nationals of Dominions and Colonies, whether civilians or members of any arm of British or Indian Armies, must be treated in this matter on exactly the same lines as nationals of United Kingdom. The definition of &quot; European British subject &quot; they desire to see adopted, is definition of &quot;European&quot; in electoral rules, with the omission of words &quot;and resident in British India,&quot; which are unnecessary.Second. Position of British Soldiers. The scheme as a whole is accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government only on condition that the proposed Bill contains a provision enabling the &quot; competent military authority,&quot; in any case in which a person, subject to military law and charged with one of the five offences specified in section 4-1 Army-Act would be triable under general provisions of Bill by Court of Session to move the nearest High Court (as now to be, defined) to transfer case to its own file, and requiring High Court, on such application being made, to transfer case accordingly.Please let me have your proposals as to what authority should be &quot; competent military authority &quot; for this purpose. It was generally felt amongst my colleagues that it would be advisable that the authority in question should be higher than Commanding Officer of unit.6029     100  1.23 A
This decision mutatis mutandis should be understood as applying to Air Force and British Navy as well as to British Army, and your proposals as to &quot;competent authority&quot; should include each oi these.Third. Special procedure for racial cases. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the procedure proposed for trial of &quot;racial&quot; warrant cases must be applied also to trial of &quot; racial &quot; summons cases that is, in all &quot; racial&quot; cases there must be right to claim trial by Court of Session with jury containing majority of Europeans or Indians as the case may be.I should be glad to be informed at once of precise terms in which you propose to define cases in which racial considerations are involved.2. You will of course understand that these decisions are subject to the two points already, agreed between us, firstly, that sections 460 and. 461 must be left intact, since their repeal would be inconsistent with treaties subsisting between His Majesty&apos;s Government and six States which guarantee nationals of those States in India same treatment in judicial matters as is given to &quot;native subjects &quot; of His Majesty; and obviously differentiation would be impossible, and secondly, that seutences of whipping would not be impossible on European British subjects by first-class magistrates, district magistrates, or Courts of Session.Further, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear that in agreeing to diminution of Europeans&apos; existing rights of appeal proposed by Committee (namely, removal of right to appeal against sentence of fine only not exceeding Es. 50 imposed by district or first-class magistrate or Sessions Court, and against sentence of imprisonment of one month or less imposed by Sessions Court, also removal of right to appeal direct to High Court from magistrate^ order) His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any further diminution should such be proposed in course of passage of Bill.Telegram from Secretary of Stale to Government of India, Home Department, &apos; dated 29th December 1922.5020. Eacial distinctions. I have already communicated to you in my telegram dated 21st December decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter. I have now approved in Council, under section 65 (3) Government of India Act, introduction of legislation which will have effect (i) of empowering Courts of Session to sentence to death European British subjects as now to be defined ; (ii) of bringing within, definition of High Court in section 4 (1) (j) of Code for purposes of trial of European British subjects Courts of Judicial Commissioner of Central Provinces, Oudh and Sindh.2. This sanction is given without prejudice to decisions on points of detail, as to which I await your final proposals.Telegram from the Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of Slate for India, dated 13th January 1923 (received complete 15th January).Racial Distinctions. Reference to correspondence ending your telegram of the 29th ultimo, 5020. We have now considered opinions of Eocal Governments as affected by the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and submit our final recom-mendations for your approval.2. In the first place, Ave refer to the three reservations of His Majesty&apos;s Government mentioned in your telegram of the 21st ultimo.First, definition of European British subjects. We recognise the Imperial considerations which have moved His Majesty&apos;s Government in this respect, and we merely reiterate the view which we have already expressed, that the decision on this point involves the practical certainty that the Bill will not be passed without amendment in regard to this definition. As regards the definition in electoral rules, we understand that the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to restrict the present definition so as to apply only to persons of European descent, and at the same time to extend it so as to apply to such persons from all His Majesty&apos;s possessions. But we think definition is unsuitable for the purposes of Code of Criminal Procedure for following reasons :-(a) &quot; British possession &quot; is defined in General Clauses Act of 1897 and includes British India.    Adoption of definition in electoral rules will, therefore, extend
to the Report of the Committee recognised that their proposal to abolish this privilege was subject to there being no treaty obligation which would require its continuance It has since been ascertained that by treaties with Italy, Switzerland, Argentine&quot; Venezuela, Costa Rica and Columbia, the nationals of these States are secured in India the same privileges as are given to Indian subjects of His Majesty, as regards the procedure in criminal trials applicable to them. The contingency foreseen by the Committee has, therefore, arisen, and it is necessary to retain the existing privileges, as Indian subjects of His Majesty are given in the Bill a full right to claim trial by jurors, of whom the majority shall be Indians, or with the aid of assessors, who shall all be Indians. It would be impossible to differentiate between nationals of the six States and of other European or American States, and accordingly the privileges have been retained for all. The only difference is that, so far as these persons are concerned, in analogy with the provisions as regards Indian British subjects, it has provided that they shall be allowed to claim, if practicable, trial with the aid of assessors, all of whom are European or Americans. These provisions are included in the subsections (2) of the proposed sections 275 and 284a of the Code which are included in clauses 13 and 15.&quot;15. Secondly, position of British soldiers : &quot; Bill includes a provision which is not dealt with in the proposals of the Committee. This relates to the position of persons serving in His Majesty&apos;s Navy, Army or Air Force. Formally, a person who is subject to military law is triable either by ordinary courts or by courts-martial; but, by the proviso (a) to section 11 of the Army Act, courts-martial may not try persons subject to military law who are accused of commission of either treason, murder, manslaughter, treason felony or rape, within 100 miles of a competent civil court, unless person is on active service. It is proposed in the Bill to make Sessions Courts competent courts for trials of such cases, instead of High Courts as at present, whether alleged offence is committed by a European soldier or by a European civilian. It is thought, however, that in particular cases it may be desirable in the interests of discipline to secure that the case shall be tried by a High Court.&quot; Bill therefore gives power to a competent authority, when a person subject to the Naval Discipline Act, or to the Army Act, or to the Air Force Act, is accused of one of the five offemces, to instruct the Advocate-General, who is then required to move the High Court as now to be defined. High Court will then transfer the case to itself or order that it be committed to itself for trial, when it will be tried by jury in the High Court. The provision is merely an extension of the existing provisions of section 526 of&apos; the Code. Under subsection 2 of the proposed section 526a the Governor-General in Council is empowered to declare by notification the officers who shall be the competent authority for this purpose. The Governor-General in Council proposes to appoint the following authorities to be the competent authorities for this purpose : &quot; (1) For persons subject to the Naval Discipline Act The commander-in-Chief of His Majesty&apos;s Naval Forces in the East Indies ;&quot; (2) For persons subject to the Army Act The General Officers Commanding the Northern, Southern, Eastern or Western Command, to whom such person is subordinate, and in case he is not subordinate to any such General Officer, His Excellency the Commander-m-Chief ; and&quot; (3) For persons subject to the Air Force Act The Air Vice-Marshal.&quot; In this respect the Government of India have thought that it was advisable to give the power only to officers entrusted with very high responsibility, and they are confident that the power which it is now proposed to vest in these officers will only be used in exceptional cases.&quot;Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, Home Department,dated 24th January 1028.337. Racial Distinctions. Your telegram dated 13th January received here complete 15th January.His Majesty&apos;s Government accept form of definition of &quot; European British subject &quot; proposed in your para. 3, also proposals in your paras. 6 and 7 as to method of defining &quot;racial cases,&quot; and proposals in your para. 10 as to method of trial of such cases.   As regards British soldiers, they accept your proposal that &quot;competent
privileged position as regards procedure in criminal trials applicable to them to large numbers&apos; of Anglo-Indians who may have been domiciled in India for several generations and have never enjoyed privileged position in past. British India must, therefore, be excluded from expression of &quot; British possession &quot; lor this purpose.(6) There appears to be no reason, for the present purposes, to differentiate between persons born or domiciled in States in India and persons born or domiciled in British India.(c) Definition in electoral rules does not include grandchildren, who are included in the present definition.(d) We think it unsafe to exclude naturalised persons, who are included in the present definition.(a) We consider that concessions should only apply to persons of legitimate descent. This is a restriction which has been in. force since European British subjects were first made amenable to jurisdiction of the ordinary magistrates&apos; courts in 1872. As a general rule, persons of mixed illegitimate descent are of such a class that it is inadvisable to give them privileged position as regards criminal procedure applicable to them, and we think existing restriction should therefore still continue.In these circumstances we recommend that definition should be : &quot; (i) Any subject of His Majesty of European descent in the male line, born, naturalised or domiciled in the British Islands or any colony ; or&quot; (ii) Any subject of His Majesty who is the child or grandchild of any such person by legitimate descent.&quot;We believe this will give effect to intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and, if not, for rejection of continuance of concession to grandchildren, we should propose,, whilst opposing, to acquiesce. The word &quot; colony&quot; will, of course, be interpreted by reference to definition in General Clauses Act, and we consider it advisable to t;dce advantage of this definition in order to avoid necessity for expressly excluding British India, as would, be the case if we used term &quot; British possession.&quot;4. Secondly, position of British soldier. We consider that the decision that the competent military authority should be able to ensure that any of these cases shall be transferred to High Court for trial in High Court is open to obvious legal objections, and that we may be subjected to serious theoretical criticism in the Legislature, where legal profession is strongly represented. On this account, we consider that no provision of this kind is required, for, as indicated in para. 9 of our telegram No. 28 C, dated 20th December, we think, in any case in which competent military authority would be justified in using these powers, he would already be able to obtain transfer to High Court under existing law. But if a provision is to h&apos;e included, we think it would be far preferable to give power to Local Government than to any military authority, and we should be glad to receive your approval to our accepting such a modification of the clause, if it is pressed in Legislature. We recognise that you may not be able immediately to answer regarding this approval, but immediate reply is not necessary, in View of course we have suggested. As it is, we are including competent military authority in Bill, and will endeavour to persuade Legislature to accept on grounds : (a) that  the  competent  military  authority would only utilise provision in exceptional cases, and(b) High Court already possesses power to transfer such cases for trial by itself,or to order committal to itself under section 520. Thus, trial itself would be held according to procedure already admissible under Code, and provision merely means the introduction of special procedure for ensuring that such cases shall be tried by High Court as now to be defined.5. The provision will be new section 526a. In this we take power to Governor-General in Council to declare by notification competent authority for particular classes of cases. We think it advisable to take the power in this way rather than definitely to specify competent authority now, in order to avoid the necessity for legislation if, in future, it should be thought desirable to change the competent military authority for this purpose. We agree with His Majesty&apos;s Government that authority should be distinctly higher than Commanding Officers of a unit, because the higher the responsibility of an officer, the more discreet is exercise of his powers. In this respect, we observe that Commander-in-Chief and the Army Commanders have been given advisory staff as regards legal matters. For persons subject to military law, we therefore propose that competent authority shall be Army contribute-A2
inander to whom such person is subordinate, and, in cases when such person is not subordinate to any Army Commander, it should be His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief. As regards His Majesty&apos;s Naval Forces, we similarly propose that competent authority shall be COmmander-in-Chief of His Majesty&apos;s Naval Forces in the East Indies, and, as regards His Majesty&apos;s Air Forces, the Vice-Marshal. We propose definitely to inform Legislature that it is the present intention of the Governor-General in Council to give power to these authorities. We are providing that competent authority will instruct Advocate-General, who will then be required to move High Court, and High Court will then order case to be committed or transferred to itself for trial by jury. As regards this, please see definition of Advocate-General in Code. It will, we think, avoid any question of competent authority being required to move High Court personally.6. Thirdly, Racial Cases. As regards the terms in which racial cases will be defined, we observe that, in the draft Bill, procedure for such cases is included in chapter which takes place of present chapter 33 ; other special provisions relating to European British subjects and Europeans and Americans being distributed in their proper places throughout the Code. Wre have drafted Bill on idea that it is not advisable to include in it actual term &quot; racial cases &quot; (though for convenience of reference we refer to racial cases in this telegram), and that, save in cases where, if claimed, provisions of the chapter will automatically apply, the decision must be left to, the courts, who wall be guided, by the same criterion as in section 526, sub-section (1), clause (e). Subsection (1.) of proposed section 413, therefore, after providing for the claim by the accused person in course of the trial outside the Presidency towns of any offence punishable with imprisonment, runs as follows :  &quot; The magistrate enquiring into or trying case, after making such enquiry as he thinks necessary, if he is satisfied &quot;(a) that the complainant and the accused persons, or any of them, are, respectively, European and Indian British subjects, or Indian and European British subjects, or&apos;&quot; (6) that, in view of the connection with the case of both European British subjects and an Indian British subject, it is expedient for the ends of justice that the case should be tried under the provisions of this chapter, shall record a finding that the case is a case which ought to he tried under the provisions of this chapter; or, if he is not so satisiied, record a finding that it is not such a case.&quot;Subsection (2) provides for appeal in the case of the rejection of the claim to sessions judge, whose decision is final; and subsection (3) for staying of the proceedings until expiratiou of period allowed for appeal, or until appeal is decided.Proposed section 444 then defines complainant so as to include persons laying information to police, but by the proviso it is secured that the case shall not be tried under the chapter, by reason of the fact that the complainant is Public Prosecutor, or public servant or officer, or servant of local authority, or railway servant or officer, or servant of company, association, or body to which Local Government, by general or special order, declares provisions of section to apply, and accused is of different nationality. As regards this proviso, we note that it gives effect to our original intention and is justifiable on grounds indicated in such opinions as the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, and Chief Court, Lower Burma.7. We are fixing period of limitation for appeal from finding that procedure shall not apply at seven days ; this period will be included in the Limitation Act among the provisions of that Act. These, in particular section 5, will apply to its computation.8. We now turn to the decision that procedure for trial of racial ujarrant cases shall be applied to trial of racial summons cases, and on this question we trust that the decision is not, as regards the exact form, wholly irrevocable. We did not anticipate that His Majesty&apos;s Government would think it necessary to issue definite instructions in this respect, and have, therefore, not hitherto placed our position in detail before you. The proposals of the Committee represent, as we have urged before, delicately balanced compromise between interests affected. Proposal to modify proposals in report, in favour of course suggested by one party to compromise and to attempt to carry out modifications in Legislature where the other party is oyer-overwhelmingly predominant, would place us tactically in a clearly undefendable position.
9. Reference to Oarey&apos;s minute of dissent will show that the objection of European community to&apos; this portion of proposals is based, not upon any idea that proposals of Committee will not prevent failure of justice in cases in which European British subjects are accused, but to point staled in minute that the proposal of Committee would begin the &quot;introduction .o  a procedure which the progress of Inclianisation of the services may make difficult to maintain,&quot; and feel consequently as procedure is found impracticable it will ultimately be abandoned. We have examined the nature of probable racial summons cases and believe their numbers will be very few indeed. This follows largely from a fact that such cases will frequently only become summons&apos; cases on proof by accused of considerations which will reduce the gravity of offence, and such cases would be, therefore, normally triable as warrant cases under procechtre applicable thereto. On these grounds, we think that the position of Europeans would be adequately met if suggestion of Government of Assam were adopted, and no special procedure wrere prescribed for such cases, but Europeans were to depend upon trial by as experienced magistrate as possible and powers of appeal. We recognise, however, that the strong position taken by European community in this respect precludes our making any such proposal. If, as we believe, European view is as stated above, it is supported by views of some Governments that, in some areas, Committee&apos;s proposals are impracticable, and on consideration we doubt whether committal to sessions will be more expensive on the average than the adoption of the Committee&apos;s proposal. These are the considerations pointing to acceptance of decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in form communi-cated to us, but we believe that Indians, on the other hand, would urge that it would mean that Indian magistracy now given no jurisdiction over European British subjects would in practice obtain in future only very slightly greater jurisdiction than at present. Proposal would, therefore, be strongly opposed in the Legislature, and we should like in this respect to be able to put forward proposals which we would support on the lines indicated above, and which we consider would meet the European standpoint, and therefore, we trust, of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and at the same time we hope to have some prospect of securing approval from the Legislature..10. We recommend, therefore, that procedure recommended by Committee should be prescribed for racial summons cases punishable with imprisonment, but that Local Government should be given power to direct that in any district specified in notification such cases should be tried in accordance with procedure laid down for trial of racial warrant cases. This latter provision may be compared with powers given to Local Government under section 269, as amended by Devolution Act, 1920, as regards juries. This would be only a minor deviation from the proposals of the Committee, and we think we might carry Legislature with us. We doubt, however, whether we should do this if we omitted the proposal of the Committee altogether, particularly as ihe alternative of only having warrant case procedure was considered and rejected by Committee. We have tentatively provided accordingly in draft Bill. We believe that this meets the views of European community and trust it also meets the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.11. We now turn to our final conclusions. As regards details, we propose to accept the views of the Committee as previously endorsed by us, subject to the following modifications, which, as indicated in para. 3 - of our telegram of 20th December, have been framed so as to effect such reductions in cost as may be possible without affecting the bases of compromise : (A) Rights of appeal from sentences of fine only, inflicted on summary trial by-first-class magistrate empowered under section 260, should only be given when sentences of fine only exceeding Rs. 200 have been imposed. So. far as European British subjects are concerned, this will reduce the existing rights of appeal beyond what already proposed, and for others will leave rights of appeal from sentences of fine only, inflicted after summary. trial, unaffected. We believe that Europeans are not concerned about the slight reductions in the right of appeal from sentences of fine only ; their objection&apos; is to any reduction in rights of appeal from sentences of imprisonment, and their position in this&apos;respect must be fully secured. So far as Indians are concerned, we hope to carry Legislature in this proposal to reduce the rights of appeal proposed by the Committee ; we do not think that it affects bases of compromise, and we are impressed by the suggestions in several opinions that adoption of, the Committee^ proposal will result in demand for more elaborate procedure for trial of summary cases, and a consequential considerable increase of 6029 A 8
expenditure. This modification of the Committee&apos;s proposal is of some importance in this respect, as sentences of line only are perhaps visual sentences in summary trials.(B) Rights of appeal from sentences passed in jury trials on matters of fact shall be restricted outside Presidency towns to racial cases and cases transferred to High Courts and tried in High Courts by jury ; and in Presidency towns to cases in which the High Court grants leave to appeal on the ground that, if tried outside Presidency towns, cases would have been triable as racial cases. It is essential that appeals should lie in these cases, as acquittals by jury of same nationality as accused is gravamen of charge against present system. So far as other cases are concerned it is not essential to give right of appeal now; provisions of section 307 will still apply to sessions cases ; and though we are prepared to announce that grant of rights of appeal on facts from sentences passed in all jury cases is proper course, and will be followed when money available, or if experience shows that expenditure involved by such course is not likely to be very heavy, yet present estimates indicate that this course will involve increase in number of High Court Judges and consequential heavy additional expenditure which should not be incurred in present financial circumstances. Opinions of Calcutta High Court and Mr. Justice Kincaid, Bombay High Court, afford some support to our present, recommendation.(C) With restriction of appeals, as in (B), we would not continue restriction previously proposed that such appeals shall not lie if jury unanimous and Judge agrees with them, as that merely meant one obstinate juror could give right of appeal in cases of appeals from decisions in High Courts in jury trials.We will only provide bench of two Judges, same number as for similar appeals from sessions trials; Chief Justice has power to arrange bench of three Judges if he considers that advisable, and it is unnecessary to provide that bench, in all such cases, shall consist of three Judges.(D) We are modifying proposals as to number of jurors so as to give jury of seven, and, if practicable, nine in all cases punishable with death, which are tried in Court of Session by jury.1(E) As indicated in remarks in para. 0 above, power to claim that case is racial, case will be given to accused only, and not to complainant as well. We do not see how it could ever serve the purposes of complainant to make such application, and we understood that possibly Committee&apos;s proposal was made because suggestion was once considered by them to give right of appeal from acquittal in racial cases to complainaut, instead of to Government only, though this proposal was never included in the previous drafts of report. If Legislature re-inserts complainant, we should acquiesce, as we believe that complainant is never likely to make claim.We trust that you will be able to communicate your orders on these recora-mendations within next few days. We have already indicated our opinion that decision regarding the definition of European British subjects involves practical certainty that Bill will not be passed without considerable amendment. As regards this point, we note that it is notorious that two members of the Government were members of the Committee, and took considerable part in securing compromise embodied in the Committees report. They signed the recommendations in the report, and it must, therefore, be clear to any intelligent observer that the Govern-ment of India were prepared to accept the proposal of the minority of the Committee regarding definition of European British subjects. Further, the Committee did not think it necessary to include any special provision regarding the position of the British soldier, and it may, therefore, be readily surmised that the Government of India did not consider special provision in this respect essential. On these two points we are bound to accept the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but, particularly as regards the definition of European British subjects, we must observe that, as the representatives of India, we were driven to make proposals for the withdrawal of the privileged position possessed now by subjects of His Majesty, loom, naturalised or domiciled in any of the Colonies. His Majesty&apos;? Government have rejected our proposals because they cannot accept any discrimination^ between the various Colonies, and this is the very principle upon which India takes its stand, namely, discrimination against her subjects in certain Colonies. We would ask, there-fore, for your specific approval to our stating in the Legislature that the only reason for the inclusion of these two provisions in Bill is the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in view of the position which they hold with reference to the Dominions and to the Army, were only able to sanction the proposals made by the Committee subject to these&quot; two reservations. From the political point of view the third reservation of His Majesty&apos;s Government is perhaps of even more importance, and we accordingly trust
expenditure. This modification of the Committee&apos;s proposal is of some importance in this respect, as sentences of fine only are perhaps usual sentences in summary trials(B) Rights of appeal from sentences passed in jury trials on matters of fact shall be restricted outside Presidency towns to racial cases and cases transferred to High Courts and tried in High Courts by jury ; and in Presidency towns to cases in which the High Court grants leave to appeal on the ground that, if tried outside Presidency towns, cases would have been triable as racial cases. It is essential that, appeals should lie in these cases, as acquittals by jury of same nationality as accused is gravamen of charge against present system. So far as other cases are concerned it is not essential to give right of appeal now; provisions of section 307 will still apply to sessions cases ; and though we are prepared to announce&apos; that grant of rights of appeal on facts from sentences passed in all jury cases is proper course, and will be followed when money available, or if experience shows that expenditure involved by such course is not likely to be very heavy, yet present estimates indicate that this course will involve increase in number of High Court Judges and consequential heavy additional expenditure which should not be incurred in present financial circumstances. Opinions of Calcutta High Court and Mr. Justice lvincaid, -Bombay High Court, afford some support to our present recommendation.(Cj With restriction of appeals, as in (B), we would not continue restriction previously proposed that such appeals shall not lie if jury unanimous and Judge agrees with them, as that merely meant one obstinate juror could give right of appeal in cases of appeals from decisions in High Courts in jury trials.We will only provide bench of two Judges, same number as for similar appeals from sessions trials ; Chief Justice has power to arrange bench of three Judges if he considers that advisable, and it is unnecessary to provide that bench, in all such cases, shall consist of three Judges.(D) We are modifying proposals as to number of jurors so as to give jury of seven, and, if practicable, nine in all cases punishable with death, which are tried in Court of Session by jury.(E) As indicated in remarks in para, fi above, power to claim that case is racial case will be given to accused only, and not to complainant as well. We do not see how it could &quot;ever serve the purposes of complainant to make such application, and we understood that possibly Committee&apos;s proposal was made because suggestion was once considered by them to give right of appeal from acquittal in racial cases to complainant, instead of to Government only, though this proposal was never included in the previous drafts of report. If Legislature re-inserts complainant, we should acquiesce, as we believe that complainant is never likely to make claim.We trust that you will be able to communicate your orders on these reeom-mendations within next few days. Wo have already indicated our opinion that decision regarding the definition of European British subjects involves practical certainty that Bill will not be passed without considerable amendment. As regards this point, we note that it is notorious that two members of the Government were members of the Committee, and took considerable part in securing compromise embodied in the Committee&apos;s report. They signed the recommendations in the report, and it must, therefore, be clear to any intelligent observer that the Govern-ment of India were prepared to accept the proposal of the minority of the Committee regarding definition of European British subjects. Further, the Committee did not think it necessary to include any special provision regarding the position of the British soldier, and it may, therefore, be readily surmised that the Government of India did not consider special provision in this respect essential. On these two points we are bound to accept the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but, particularly as regards the definition of European British subjects, we must observe that, as the representatives of India, we were driven to make proposals for the withdrawal of the privileged position possessed now by subjects of His Majesty, born, naturalised or domiciled in any of the Colonies. His Majesty&apos;s Government have rejected our proposals because they cannot accept any discrimination between the various Colonies, and this is the very principle upon which India takes its stand, namely, discrimination against her subjects in certain Colonies. We would ask, there-fore, for your specific approval to our stating in the Legislature that the only reason for the inclusion of these two provisions in Bill is the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in view of the position which they hold with reference to the Dominions and to the Army, were only able to sanction, the proposals made by the Committee subject to these two reservations. From the political point of view the third reservation of His Majesty&apos;s Government is perhaps of even more importance, and we accordingly trust
that the modification&apos; we have suggested as regards the racial summons cases will be-accepted. We referred in. our telegram 889, dated 11th November, to efforts of the mischief-makers to exploit the delay in publication of the report and our proposals thereon, as evidence of the conflicting opinion between you and His Majesty&apos;s Government and us, and as indication that His Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to resile from the measure of legislative autonomy already granted to India. Decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding Dominion subjects, though it may cause much feeling here, will, however, be regarded as not without justification from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in view of its position as custodian of Imperial interests. Similar considerations apply to the special provision as regards the position of the British soldier, but they do not apply to the decision as regards racial snmmuns cases, and we think that the latter decision, if not modified as we have recommended, is likely to be politically more harmful.13. If we receive your orders within the next few days, we propose, in conformity with the views previously urged by you, to delay publication until we can publish the Bill at the same time as the Report. Publication would then take place about seven days after receipt of your orders, as this interval will be necessary in order to cable, copies of the Bill to reach Local Governments in time for release on same clay as Report. Bill would then be introduced in Assembly by publication on about 27th January, which would enable consideration stage to be taken in Assembly in second half of February, and if Bill is passed by Assembly in February it can be taken in Council of State during March. To Bill we would attach full explanatory statement of objects and reasons, indicating the proposals of the Committee, how those proposals have been modified, small differences in criminal procedure applicable to European British subjects and Indian British subjects which would be retained, rights which would be taken from European British subjects, and general method adopted in Bill in giving effect to proposals. Then would follow detailed notes on the clauses. We gather that you do not wish to see memorandum verbatim, before it is published. We think, however, that you should know how we propose to refer to the modifications as regards European British subjects, Europeans and Americans, and position of British soldiers. We therefore repeat for your approval terms in which we would refer to these points.14. First, European British subjects and Europeans and Americans. We begin by saying that the main modification in the proposals of the Committee which has been included.in the Bill is in regard to the definition of European British subjects. We then recite the actual proposal of the Committee.. We then continue as follows : &quot; Subjects of His Majesty who were born, naturalised or domiciled in any Colony, and their children and grandchildren by legitimate descent, have, however, been retained in definition. It is assumed that the object of the Committee in proposing the discrimination against Dominion subjects was to obtain a medium of bargaining which could be used to secure an improvement in the conditions of Indians living in certain Dominions. The disabilities of Indians in certain Dominions exist, however, in an entirely different plane, and it must be remembered that Indians in the Dominions are (?not) subjected to disabilities as regards the procedure in criminal trials applicable to them. The number of Dominion subjects in India is so small that it is doubtful if the point would be of any weight as a medium of bargaining, and it would probably result in the loss of benefits which the Government of India hope will follow from the recent tour conducted by the Right Honourable Srinavasa Sastri. His Majesty&apos;s Government are particularly interested in the Imperial aspect of the proposal, and they consider that it would raise an invidious and controversial question throughout the Empire. The Secretary of State for India in Council, whose sanction was required for certain provisions of the Bill, has accordingly only accorded his sanction on the understanding that the definition proposed in the Bill will be accepted. On the other hand, it is recognised that existing definition is unsuitable, for the reasons given by the Committee, and accordingly the category of persons included in the definition at present has been restricted, on lines adopted in the definition of a &quot; European &quot; in the Electoral Rules, to persons of European descent in. the male line.&quot; A connected question is that of the position of Europeans (not being European British subjects) and Americans. At the present time they are empowered to claim in sessions trials that they shall be tried, if practicable, by jurors or with the aid of assessors, of whom the majority shall be Europeans or Americans.   The signatories &apos;
authority &quot; should be prescribed by notification, and they regard as suitable the various authorities you intend to prescribe. They are, further, prepared to accept substitution of Local Government for military authority as authority to move High Court, if you find sucli an alteration essential in debate, but subject to the under-standing that this amendment if adopted must be so drafted as to require Local Government to instruct Advocate-General to move High Court, and the High Court being moved to order transfer, if the &quot;competent authority&quot; so desires. This amendment will not affect your proposals for definition of competent authority. It will be best, in order to avoid possibilities of misunderstanding, if you telegraph text of amendment you would propose with this object; ample time remains before consideration of Bill.Para. 11 of your telegram.J accept without question your proposed modifications of original scheme headed (A.), (D.) and (E.). As regards (B.) and (C), I make no objection, but suggest that it would be wiser not to announce that you regard extension of right of appeal on facts to all jury cases, &quot;non-racial&quot; as well as &quot;racial,&quot; as proper course to be adopted if funds permit, unless you find this tactically necessary in course of debates. I feel there is much to be said for the view that extension of this right to non-racial jury cases is unnecessary and undesirable, irrespective of question of cost.Para. 14 of your telegram.As regards text of proposed explanatory statement, I suggest following for your consideration on Dominions point, as alternative to passage beginning &quot; It is assumed &quot; and ending &quot; Srinavasa Sastri.&quot; It seems to me preferable to reserve your arguments as far as possible for debate, and to give only one reason on this occasion : &quot; Indians in the Dominions are not subjected to disabilities as regards the procedure applicable to them in criminal trials, and the principle of reciprocity accepted by India- makes it impossible to accord to Dominion subjects in India less favourable treatment than is accorded to Indians in the Dominions. Any other decision would prejudice, rather than improve, the prospect of obtaining for Indians in the Dominions better treatment in matters outside the sphere of judicial procedure.&quot;Foreign Office desire following to be substituted for fourth sentence in passage relating to Americans and non-British Europeans: &quot; It has since been ascertained that by treaties with Italy, Switzerland, the Argentine, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Columbia the same privileges as regards procedure in criminal trials are secured in India to the nationals of those countries as are given to Indian subjects of His Majesty.&quot;Para. 15 of your telegram.Would it not be advisable to omit the words &quot;in the interests of discipline&quot;? xTo doubt some such reason must be given if you are pressed in debate, but it seems unnecessary to give this somewhat controversial explanation in advance.Please note that wording of whole of passages quoted in your paras. 14 and 15 must be so altered for publication as to preserve integrity of telegraphic cypher, since same secret cypher was used for them in your telegram as for para. 13.

CP. 4320, CP. 4.328, CP. 4352, CP. 4363, CP.4346 and CP. 4370.THE LORD CHANCELLOR then read a.condensed summery of the present law and of the proposals for its alteration. This is reproduced as Annexure I to theso Minutes, after consideration, of,the scheme in detail and&apos;as a whole it was decided - ,&apos;   .that the&quot;&apos;proposals of the Government Of India should be accepted subject to the&apos; following reservationsA. Thst the proposal made, in %r. Carey1s Minute attached to the Indian Committee^ Report should ho accepted - that, is to say that.the prooedure proposed, by the Indian &quot;Committee for the trial of warrant cases in which racial considerations are involved should be adopted for&apos; the trial of all oases - whether 1 summons&apos; or r - warrant1 cases --in whioh racial considerations are involved.B. That while there is no objection to the curtailment of existing rights of appeal possessed by European British subjacts to the extent &apos; proposed - that is, that there should be hence-forward no&quot;appeal against a sentence of fine only set exceeding fis. 50 imposed fey a District or First
Claws. Magistrate or a Sessions Court, nor. against-.&apos; a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding one-&apos;       ^ ;; month imposed by a Sessions Court and that the existing right of appealing direct from a Magis-trate to a Eig-h Court should be removed   - it should bo made clear that His Majesty&apos;e Government could not agree to any further diminution of the rierhts of aepesl available to European British subjects, should such be proposed in the course of the discussion nf the Bill.C.   That the coa.promise relating to tho exclusion ^f/^Coi^nials&apos;&apos;,,from the definition of &quot;iSaropean British subject&quot; which was suggested in the viceroy private telegram of 16th December - namely that &quot;colonials&quot; should be placed in the same position as Americans and Europeans who are not British subjects was unacceptable, and tbat the decision of the Cabinet of 19th December on this matter must stand.(Before this decision was taken attention was partiou-. larly drawn to the position of the Viceroy in this matter as set forth in CP. 4370.It was suggested that in communicating to the Severnmant cf India Hie MajastyTs GnvarncahVs decision on this matter, stress should be -aid on the fact that the definition as proposes by the Committee would not have excluded immediately all British subjects born or domiciled in the Dominions and Colonies, and would therefore apart from the demerits arising from the policy underlying it, have been ineffective to secure the object aimed at by the Indian Committee.   This suggestion was generally endorsed by the Committee).I), ^rising cut of decision C; it was decided that th - d/vfinitior: of European contained, in the Indian Bl-vct oral ruins should fee adopted as the definition
: &apos; &quot; &quot;&apos;&apos;    ir&apos;&quot;of &quot;European British subjeot&quot; for this ntirpose, and. **&quot; rdiould he substituted for the definition In S.4(l) (i) of the Co&quot;e of Criminal Prooodure subject however to the &apos;omission of the words &quot;and resident in British India,&quot;I!.   The proposals in their effect upon/the-&apos;British soldier.The attention of the Committee&quot;in this connection also was drawn to the position of tho Viceroy in this matter as set out in his private telegram of the 16th December (CP. 4370).THE SECTARY OE STATE FOR war stated that he could not agree to&apos; the proposals unless some arrangements were made whereby the five offences specified in S;41 of - the Army Aot were removable from&apos; the jurisdiction of Sessions Courts. If no such arrangement were possible&apos; then he would have to press for the entire exclusion of the British soldier from the scope of the proposed alterations of the law.On tho suggestion of the Lord Chancellor It was agreed that this object could best be secured by providing in the proposed Indian Bill that the competent military authority should have the right to move the nearest&apos; High Court (as now to be defined) in any case in which a&apos; person subject to .. military, law and charged with one of those five offences would bo triable under those proposals by a Court of Session, totransfer the case to its own file, and that on such an ap;li-bocation being nado, it should/obligatory upon tho High Court to transfer the case accordingly.&quot;&apos;   TIE:: SE(E&quot;&apos;-:EAPY OP STATE FOE EAR stated that this proposal Vfould meet his views on the understanding that if the Oovcrn-meht of India did not accept the suggestion then tho existing position&apos;, of-British soldiers as regards the&apos; five offences shall remain unaltered,TEE QCMEJEEEE then called in and &quot;questioned SIR&apos;vrILLIaM VTECrET on this sug,.os?&apos;tion.     Ho stated that he saw he technics objection to making such a provision,&quot;but that to make this or any other exception in favour of the British soldier *&apos;ouia , reatly increase the difficulty /
of se curjLng the- a^eemerrfc^f&quot;--the^.JndiarL-le^^aturre-t o the proposed legislation, and might involve the breaisdowa-of. the entire scheme.     He did not think the object ion would he lessened by making the reservation applicable   $ also to Indian soldier a.THE EIRST LORD 01- THE ADMIRALTY explained the position of the Savy in relation to the proposals in the terms of the Memorandum attached as Annexure II, hut-stated that the Admiralty would wish the iTavy personnel to he placed in the same legal position in this matter as the British Army and Air Eorce,TEE GOIaMIITEB then decided:-that the proposals of the Government.of India could be agreed to only on the condition that the suggestion made by the Lord Chancellor as set out above (which should be taken as includ-ing members of the navy and Air -EoT-cc-als-cr) ware adopted-. (2)    SIR WILLIAM VlhCEITT was also questioned by the Committee regarding the Dominions question-. . He- sard, the proposals of the Indian Committee in this matter were regarded as an essential part of the compromise, and that the the Indian Legislature would almost certainly disagree to the definition of European British subject now adopted ty His Majesty&apos;s Government.THE COMMITTEE agreed that as the Cabinet had decided that in tho event of agreement by this Committee., the Secretary of State for India was at liberty to Communicate the decisions as those of His Majesty&apos;^ Government to the Government of India -That the minutes of these deciaicits chorale b&quot;--;;otllod hp tho Secretary of Stats for;-,India in.: consultation TTitk. tho Lord Chancellor end that the decisions diould thon b&quot; communicated to the Governor of india:2i?-te^hL:L Gardens, g.W.1.20th Dgoembl^lQgl??&quot;7 \- 4 -

But if the criminal is claimed by the Civil Power on&apos;shore, we cannot, prevent their trying him by-fany competent Court on shore;   and in a tussle the Civil Power would over-ride the Laval.(Sgc..)
