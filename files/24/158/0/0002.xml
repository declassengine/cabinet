(THIS DOCUMENT IS TPE FRO TORT OP HTa PFITANNIC MAJESTY -S GOVERNMENT).. VERY SECRET. C A I NJ5 T.6*P.2(23). RELEASE 0-&apos; &quot; &quot;E CO CAUGHT RANGER PRISONERS. 1 gNote by the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies,,By the direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies the attached copies of recent belecrams that have passed between the Colonial Office and Dublin upon the subject of the release of the Connaught Ranker prisoners are circulated for the information of the Cabinet..On receiving Mr. Loughnane&apos;s telegram of today, I communicated with the Duke of Devonshire by telephone and read over to him the text of ...the..&apos;message.     The Secretary of State took the view, also held by the Rjme Secretary, that the condition attaching to the decision taken by the Cabinet on Friday last (as recorded in the Cabinet minutes 72 (22) item 4) was fulfilled by the message now received through Kr, Louehnane from the Government of the Free State, convey-&quot; ing a definite expectation that the release of the Connaught Ranger prisoners alone would give a sufficient impetus to the Amnesty Bill to carry it through safely and an assurance that the Free State Government would do their utmost to ensure Its passage,,     The Secretary of State considered that the authority already given by the Cabinet, supplemented by the oral directions of the Prime Minister before leaving London for Paris, was sufficient for immediate action to be taken.The Duke of Devonshire authorised me to convey his view to the TTome Secretary in order that the necessary step might be taken for the immediate release of the prisoners, as the second reading of the Indemnity Bill was being taken in the Irish Parliament tomorrow and. it was important that the release could not be ascribed to political pressure brought to bear as a consequence of debate upon the Bill in the Dail.(Sd,) J.E, Master-ton Smith,Colonial Office, S. 3rd January, 1923,
5BXBGBAM RECEIVED III THIi IRISH OFFICE.Date Janxiary 1st,,&apos;1923,  &apos; ended in at Vice Regal Lodge, Received here at 11,50 a,ia0&apos;rom Loughnane To Masterton Smithw_____________________________________________________(Secret and Personal).____I had a further discussion yesterday with the Governor General, President Cosgraye, Mr, Duggan and Mr., Desmond litagerald regarding the cases ox CBR. and D.      The reply to the question I was instructed to put to them is that theygreatly fear that the resv.lt would not be to diminish to\any material extent the difficulties they apprehend in dealing with the Indemnity Bill.     While giving this as his considered view of the probable result Mr, Cosgrav-c said that the question was a very difficult one.    It supposed a situation they had never seriously contemplated and he gave his opnion with some degree of uncertainty.     The case of the CR, was for the moment of much greater importance than that of D. because it was attracting much more attention but he feared that If it was out of the way the case of DQ might quickly leap from a position of secondary to one of primary importance.     In fact its present secondary importance was mainly due to its supposed dependence on that of the C.R.It was the general feeling shared hitherto by the Free State Government that the satisfactory solution of D&apos;s case would necessarily follow as a corollary upon that of the C.R.     I explained the essential difference between the two cases an opinion in which the Governor General concurred and which Mr, Cosgrave and his Ministers were quick to appreciate . but Mr, Cosgrave felt that the reasoning would not carry &quot;conviction to many of his supporters still less to his opponents.     The fact that D&apos;s case carne up in 1918 and notin,. .
in 19l6 does not in his opinion make much material difference as the activities associated with it were those associated with Gasement and through Casement as a link it was easy to represent I)!s case as really belonging to the 1916&apos; episode.   .Aa illustrating the potential mischief involved in differentiating the treatment of D1s case fttom that of the C.R. Mr, C&amp;sgraste said that if tho -agitation around 1&quot;). gathered force a likely move would he tc run him as a candidate against a certain minister to whose constituency he &quot;belongs.     This would bs very awkward for that Ministar who is accused of being largely responsible for the drastic measures which the Free State Government have been compelled to adept and has incurred considerable, odium with the Republicans -,n that account,   ..Even against this Minister be present position would make him a formidable opponent and in several other Constituencies he would have a very good chance of success,     Mr. Cosgrave pressed Very strongly for a favourable decision in D&apos;, s case.     He pointed out that one of his Government1s greatest assets has been their ability in meeting Treaty difficulties to say that the British Government have carried out. all their undertakings in the spirit ,and the letter of the Treaty and he is very anricas to us., the argument with effect in handling the Indemnity Bill.     He and his Ministers have no sentimental interest in B. who is largely a mystery to them.     They knos- nothing of his antecedents and they are regarding his case solely from the point of view of political expediency.     He asks the British Government to take this view also and to subordinate entirely all considerations arising from the merits or/demerits
demerits of the case.   He mentioned in justification   *of this request that his Government have adopted this-attitude to meet British political necessities in the case of Li. Genochio which on investigation they regard as the shooting of a robTaafc who was attempting to escape from custody.   Mr, Cosgrave expects to meet with much criticism for paying compensation in this case as if it were one of deliberate murder but he feels that prior consideration is due to the difficulties in which the British Government have been placed by British public opinion as it is hopeless to attempt to convert British public opinion to a different view of the case by presenting what he now believes to be the true faots.0 Mx*c 0&apos;osgrawe is anxious for a clean slate on both sides as between British r.nd Free State Governments and thinks that this is worth obtaining by big concessions on both eld A further argument for an immediate favourable issue of the ceramic and D. cases was brought forward by Mr. Cosgrave label in the interview during a discussion of Heustons case Mr,. Cpsgrave stating that it would greatly strengthen his hands in dealing with sny difficulties result!rg froa delay in releasing Heuston.
TELEGRAMMasterton Smith to Loughhane. (By private Irish Office wire)January 2nd, 1923.    7 p.m.Secret and Personal *I have-discussed at length with Anderson and. with Curtis who returned.to-day your secret and personal telegram of yesterday.     It is important to appreciate at the outset that the question of the C.R. even taken by itself Is hedged about with difficulty, that in several quarters here considerable doubts have been expressed about the suggested pardon of an act of mutiny, and that the sole object that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have in advising pardon in the case of the C.R. would be to relieve - Mr. Cosgrance from serious political embarrassment and enable him to secure a reasonably smooth passage for the Indemnity Bill,It would be on these grounds that the case for remission would be presented to Parliament and to the public here as an act of high policy directly related to the Irish settlement.Then we come-to.the case of D, the more closely it is examined the- more difficult it becomes to maintain the vie?.&quot; that It can be regarded as a case of vhlch the main aspects are directly related to the Irish conflict. D was a British subject a member of His Majesty1s Forces who for two years after the death of Casement persisted in a continuing act of gross treachery to the State.     His-5- case....
ill P;    . , &quot;... I?case is strictly comparable with that of several other cases in. which British subjects similarly circumstanced and guilty of less flagrant acts of treason are still serving life sentences whose release has never been con-templated or suggested.The sum total of these considerations is that if as we had hoped you could have&apos; conveyed to us for the in-forrnation of the Cabinet an   assurance that very consider-able relief would have been afforded to ivir .Cosgrave by the immediate release of the C.R. and that the case of D. did not fall within the same category of importance, we have little doubt that it would have been far easier to bring the matter to a conclusion.     But if the&apos; case of the C.R. is to be complicated by the case of D. we can hold out no hope in present circumstances of an early decision being reached.You should put these considerations to -Kr.Hea?v&apos;&quot;-and to Mr-Cosgrave and let me know the result.  &apos; The Secretary of State is not in &quot;London bat I do&apos;not hesitate to say that the message reflects his mind.Private,and Personal Addendum,  (to go as a separate message)The passage in your telegram about &quot;Lieutenant Genochio is disquieting.     This is -the.&quot;second time that so far as I am.&apos;aware a statement of the kind has been made and. none of us here have ever seen, a scrap of evidence in support of it.     If it is persisted in, His Ma,jesty,:s Government maywell have to revert to the original request made  some monthsandago that a full/searching enquiry should be undertaken by the Free State Government into all &quot;the circumstances surrounding the death of this British Officer.
gram from Laughnane-to- Sir James - Masterton- Smith- (Secret and onal)B      Dated January 3rd, 1923-sI have discussed with the Governor General and with Mr/ Duggan and another Minister (Mr, Finian &quot; Lynch) on behalf of Mr0 Cosgrave the cases of the CfRc and of D, in the light of the&apos; further considerations set out in your telegram of last evening.     Hie&apos; fact that D-s case is strictly comparable with that of several &apos; (non Irish) other cases of men serving similar sentences whose continued detention the British Government would   -: find it difficult to justify in Parliament if DV were  .    -released impressed them greatly as an argument they could use in meeting, criticism of the differentiation of his&apos; case from that of the CR. and while they cannot commit themselves to the statement that: a separate agitation for D. would not grow&apos;to formidable dimensions during the discussion of the&apos; Indemnity Bill they do not&apos; wish, to forego the chance that, remission in the case of the C.R. would give a sufficient impetus to the Bill to carry it through safely.     As I pointed out in my last telegram Mr, Cosgrave:s opinions therein expressed were given with a feel- . ing of uncertainty and with realisation that the: appre-apprehensions of the dangers involved in D1s, non release might prove unfounded.     Both the Governor General and the two Ministers were strongly of opinion that If the difficulties&apos; surrounding the case of D. are so much greater . than &quot;those&apos;- surrounding those of the come. it is much better to try the experiment of differentiation than to attempt to pass the Bill while leaving both cases as they now stand.     The experiment might work out successfully and/the
the free State Government--would do -their utmost to ensure that it should.     While the two cases hang together in uncertainty it is felt to he impossible to estimate justly the importance which D&apos;s case would have alone and although there might remain unknown possibilities of mischief the removal of the 0.R. obstacle would give the Bill more than a fighting chance.     Tlith this obstacle still in the way the passage of the Bill would be very uphill work and riien completed might leave behind It lasting damage to the Government.The second reading of the Bill comes on on Thursday and I would strongly urge that the case of the CeR. should not&apos; be further held up by consideration of the possible&apos; effect of leaving D^s case either unsettled or adversely decided. &apos;   If the&apos; Free&apos; State Government could get a favourable decision with regard to the C.R. before Thursday it would hearten-them greatly-but there is no disguising &apos;the &apos; fact that they&apos; remain! quite- unconvinced of the necessity based on grounds of British or&apos; Imperial policy of holding on to D&apos;. &apos;   In the discussions I have had with &apos;MrV Cos grave and his -Ministers&apos;T have been very strongly impressed by the sincerity&apos;of their-conviction&apos; that it is desirable in the interests of -Anglo-Irish friendship to wipe the slate absolutely clean as regards the injuries inflicted and wrongs1 committed by both sides during the past, few years.     It was only as      -: illustrating this need that Mr. Cosgrave instanced the Genochio case, the point of the illustration not being that he was paying compensation under-protest or with reservations but that although it was represented to him by his own sido that the facts were as mentioned he had/determined .
determined not to discuss or to give publicity to that possible explanation of the case but to settle- the case in the only way which would satisfy the British public.IIo mention of this case was made in last night&apos;s discussion but Mr. Duggan pointed put&apos; that to pass an Indemnity Bill is one thing and to ensure that there shall be an effectual and plenary Indemnity is another. There are many Irishmen now exiled Including former servants of the Crown who will not venture to return to Ireland merely because this Bill becomes law.     The Free State Government wish It-to be made safe beyond question for them to return and their hope is that by animating every stratum of Irish public opinion with a sense of the justice and the sanctity of the protection the Bill seeks to afford they will curb private as well as public animosities.     They feel assured that hostility against British servants and sympathisers will be appeased by the completeness of the British amnesty and with this object in view as well as to facilitate the passage of&apos; the -Indemnity Bill they desire to be able to say that In every case represented   by them to the British Government&apos; as a fit subject for amnesty the amnesty has been given. This- they think will sink deeply into the minds of the Irish people..
