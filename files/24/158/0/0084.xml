0(This document ia the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,1ST. ip, 83(23).C A B I H E I,HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.EXPLOSIVES   BILL,Memorandum by the Home Secretary.ilI circulate a short Departmental Bill for the amendment of the,Explosives Act, 1875.Clause 1 proposes to give the Secretary of State power to require special precautions to be taken in times of disturbance, etc., for the protection of explosives factories, magazines and stores.   The need for such a provision was shown by experience during the Sinn Fein disturbances of two years ago.   It will be remembered that during these disturbances considerable quantities of explosives were stolen by Sinn Fein sympathisers, and special; measures had to be organised for the protection of places where explosives were stored.   In most cases the local police authorities, acting on the instructions from the Home Office, were able to secure more or less satisfactory arrangements, but in some oases there was difficulty,   Under the existing provisions of the Explosives Act occupierB of factories, magazines and stores are already required to take all due, precautions for preventing unauthorised persons having access to the premises or the explosive therein, but there is no power for the authorities to prescribe the nature of the precautions to be takenj   and, further, the only method of enforcing the observance of the provision 1b by proceedings in the Courts.   It will, I think, be generally agreed, in the light of past experience and of the fact that the war has made a large number of men acquainted&apos;with the handling and use of explosives, that there should be power in times of public disturbance to require adequate precautions to be taken for the protection of stocks of explosives, .and in the event of. emergency,  to ensure that these precautions are
taken at onoe.   The Bill accordingly proposes that the Secretary of State should have power to direct the special precautions to be taken in the event of special circumstances arising, and in case of any default by the occupier to take steps tp darry out the measures himself.The second Clause of the Bill, which relates to the employment of young persons in the danger buildings of explosives factories and in explosives stores; arises out of the Tipton explosion last March, when a number of young girls employed in breaking down ammunition were killedo    A great deal of public feeling was aroused by the circumstances of the disaster (which led to the conviction of the occupier of the factory for manslaughter and his being sentenced to a term of penal servitude), and in reply to questions in the Bouse I promised to consider the question of placing further       &apos; ;.ipu:. restrictions on the employment of young persons in danger buildings in explosives factorie3o   The law at present is that a young person under the age of 16 may not be employed in a..danger building or an explosives store except in the presence of and under the supervision of a grown up person.,    I am informed that, except in firework factories,, very few young persons under the age of 13 are employed in explosives factories.   In firework factories there are a number of small jobs which are quite free from danger and on which young persons can be advantageously employed^   I propose therefore that the employment of young persons under the age of 16 should be &apos; entirely prohibited in danger buildings except in connection with such non-dangerous processes 8,3 may be specified by Order of the Secretary of State; and to extend to young persons up to the age of 18 the existing provision which only permits the employment of young persons in the presence of and under the supervision of grown up persons.    There are numerous precedents in our industrial legislation for restricting the employment
of young persons in dangerous processes, e.go in the Factory . Act and Regulations made under the Factory Act.   Young persons, through their lack of experience, etc., are not only apt to he more heedless than adults, hut are also likely to be less alive to the existende of dangerous conditions^   In the case of the Tipton factory the young girls were being employed under conditions which were excessively dangerous and in direct contravention of the law, and which would $not have been allowed had the authorities been aware that the work wa3 going on.   It is possible that if adult workers and not young girls had been employed at the factory, they would have realised the danger of the conditions and given warning-   The proposal in the Bill Iwould be an additional safeguard against such occurrences in future..The third proposal in the Bill provides for a strengthen-ing of the penalties for keeping explosive in .an unauthorised-place.   It has long been felt to be a defect of the Act that the penalty for an offence of this character, which may involve serious consequences,- is limited to a fine of 2/- for every pound of explosive so kept,,    This has been found to be quite an inadequate penalty in some cases.-  For instance; a person keeping a box of 100 detonators,  or a few ounces of high explosive, either of which might give rise to a bad accident, would only be fined a purely nominal sum.I shall be glad to receive authority to introduce the Bill at a convenient opportunity.i7.
