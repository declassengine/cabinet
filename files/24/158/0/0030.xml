CHARGES    II?   TERMINOLOGY   CONSEQUENT ON   THE   ESTABLISHMENT    OP   THE   IRISH   FREE   STATE.The establishment of the Irish Free State will necessitate certain changes in terminologyoThe most important case is the name of Parliament itself.     By the Union with Ireland Act, 1300, it Was efcacted that &quot;Parliament is to be styled the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland&quot;,     It is clear that some alteration in the title must be made;   for though Parliament will still, legislate as respects reserved matters for Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland will still be represented in the House JF Commons and Irish representative peers will continue to sit in the Rouse of Lords,, the functions of Parliament with respect to Ireland will be comparatively insignificant, and the Irish Free State would almost certainly object to the.retention of a title which implies tha:. Parliament is the legislative authority for the whole of Ireland.Assuming that it is decided that the title must be changed, the question arises - What title is to be substituted?     The Attorney-General has suggested the title of &quot;Parliament of the United Kingdom.&quot;     The expression &quot;United Kingdom&quot; was recognised before the union with Ireland,     The Union with Scotland Act, 1&quot;0G; speaks of &quot;the United Kingdom of Great Britain&quot; though the title given to Parliament by that Act was &quot;the Parliament of Great Britian&quot;,The change of name, whatever the new title decided on may be, will have to be effected by Act of Parliament;   for though legally the change could be made by Order in Council under section six of the Consequential Provisions Act, to ohange the name of Parliament by any authority other than an Act of Parliament ia out of the question.     The matter is one of very immediate importance, as one of the first Bills to be introduced in the coming Session will be the Consolidated Fund Bill, the opening words of which are;    !lV/e, your Majesty5 s most dutiful end loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled.11     The necessary change will have to be made before the first Consolidated Fund Bill is introduced.The change having been made, it will have to be considered what is to be the heading of the &quot;Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons.&quot;     If no change-had been made, the Votes and Proceedings of the ensuing Session would have been headed &quot;Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons in the Second Session of the Thirty-second Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland/&apos; Are the words 11 of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; simply to be struck out. or is the heading to run;    &quot;Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons in the First Session of the First Parliament of the United Kingdom&quot; - or whatever the new title of Parliament may be?     The difficulty is that whatever change is decided on cannot be made before Parliament assembles.     The heading of the Votes and Proceedings will therefore have been issued before the change is made, but no doubt the necessary alteration can subsequently be made.Another statutory expression the modification of which will requiie
consideration is   &quot;The Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&quot;     This title was made statutory by the Consolidated Fund Act, 1816. No payments into or out of the Fund will in the future be made as respects the Irish Free State;    but as respects Northern Ireland the proceeds of reserved tsixes collected in Northern Ireland will be paid into the Fund, and the cost of reserved services in Northern Ireland will be paid out of the Fund.     If the title &quot;Parliament of the United Kingdom&quot; is adopted, it will follow that a corresponding change should be made in the title of the Consolidated Fund, which should henceforth be styled &quot;The Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.&quot;In all future Acts of Parliament, it will, generally speaking, be possible sxd expedient to avoid the use of the expression &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.     If the area intended to be described is Great Britian and the whole of Ireland, the expression &quot;Great Britian and ireland&apos; can be used;    if the area to be described is not to include the Free State, the expression &quot;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; can be used.The modification, however,, to be made in the historic preamble to the Army (Annual) Bill will require special consideration.     This runs;&quot;Whereas the raising or keeping of a standing army within the United &quot;Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland in time of peace, unless it be with the &quot;consent of Parliament, is against lawj&quot;And Whereas it is adjudged necessary by His Majesty and this present &quot;Parliament that a body of land forces should be continued for the safety of &apos;&apos;the United Kingdom and for the defence of the possessions of His ila jesty&quot;&apos; s &quot;Crown, and that the whole number of such forces should consist of including those to be employed at the depots in the &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the training of recruits for &quot;service at home and abroad, but exclusive of the numbers actually serving within &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Indian possessions.&quot;And Whereas it is adjudged necessary for the safety of the United Kingdom &quot;and the defence of the possessions of this realm that a body of Royal Marine &quot;forces should be employed in His Majesty&apos;s fleet and naval service under the &quot;direction of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, or the Commissioners &quot;for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforenaido&quot;It is suggested that the modifications to be made in this preamble should be as follows:-(l)   In the first recital, strike out the words &quot;of Great Britian and ireland! (8)   In the second recital, substitute for &quot;the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland&quot; the words &quot;Great Britain and northern Ireland,&quot; (S)   In the third recital, substitute for &quot;Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom or the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral aforesaid&quot; the word &quot;Admiralty.&quot; (4)   Possibly for the words &quot;the safety of the United Kingdom and for the defence of the possessions of His Liajesty&apos;s Crown&quot; in the first recital and for similar words in the third recital there might be substituted the words &quot;the safety and defence of His Majesty:s dominions,,&quot;
T A 0 *v0The use of the expression &quot;British Islands&quot; in future Acts of Parliamentgreaterpresents soraewhat^difficulties.     By the Interpretation Act the expression is td, mean the United Kingdom; the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.     The effect of the Adaptation of Enactments Order in Council will be to exclude from this definition the Irish Free State;   but it would be a little ridiculous in future Acts of Parliament to use the expression &quot;British Islands&quot; as meaning Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,    At the saae tine, some expression meaning this area will constantly be required.Finally, the form of sections defining the extent of   Acts requires con-Eideration.     Hitherto the rule of law has been that an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom does not extend beyond the United Kingdom, unless by expreas provision or necessary implication it is made to do so, and when an Aot is intended to apply to part only of the United Kingdom an express provision., stating the part to which it is not to apply or the part only to which it is to apply, hasbeen inserted:   e .&apos;This Act shall not extend to Scotland or Ireland&quot;;  &apos;or&apos;;&apos;J&apos;his Act shall extend to Scotland only,&quot; In the future( the Irish Free State being in the position of a dominion., no Act of the Imperial Parliament will extend to it unless by express provision or necessary implication! But in the case of iiorthcrn Ireland no such rule of law will apply - certainly as respects reserved matters, and possibly not even as respects the matters with respect to which the Parliament of northern  Ireland has power to deal,, for by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920., the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament over allI per sons, matters and things is to remain unaffected and undiminished, At the same time Parliament will practically, no longer legislate for Northern Ireland in respect of matters with respect to which the Parliament of Northern IrelandIhas power to make laws.     Is it to be necessary in every case where ah Act is passed dealing with matters with respect to which the Parliament of NorthernI Ireland has&apos;power to Bake laws to insert a provision to the effect that the Aot is not to extend to Northern Ireland?F.F.L.9C 13,9-15
