A manifesto &quot;to the Workers and Peasants of India&quot;from thB Presidium of the Communist   International is printed in the same issue, in the course of which it isstated that:&quot;We are deeply interested in the struggle of the Indian people to free itself from British domination.     In this historic struggle you have the sympathy and support of the revolutionary proletarian masses of the Imperialist countries including Great Britain.&quot;We Communists know very well the predatory nature of western Imperialism which exploits brutally the peoples of the Sast and which has held them in a backward state of economio development in order that the insatiable greed of imperialist capital can be satisfied.&quot;The Infamous methods, by which British Imperialism sucks the life-blood of the Indian people, are well known.   They cannot be condemned too strongly: nor will simple condemnation be of any practical value.&quot;British rule was established by force and it is maintained by foroe;   therefore, it can and will be overthrown only by a violent revolution.   The people of India are engaged in this great revolutionary struggle.   The Communist International is whole-heartedly with them...&quot;Economic, social and cultural progress of the Incian people demands complete separation from Great Britain.   This separation, however, cannot be realised by peaceful means, nor by negotiation.   Imperial connection means nothing less than the control of the destinies of the Indian people by and for the interests of the British ruling class.   And the welfare of the Indian people demands a complete end of any such control exercised directly or indirectly in conjunction with the native upper olassos...&quot;We have watched with great enthusiasm the development of your movement during the last two years. It was a period of great revolutionary activities. How social forces of immense potentiality were drawn into the movement.     It was inspiring to watch the vast -peasant masses throw off their age-long apathy and begin a revolutionary mass action sweeping the country.   The awakening of the peasantry with the rebelliousness of the proletariat has added unprecedented vigour tc the nationalist movement which, thus, has become a formidable foe of imperialism. But it must be said that the leadership of the national Congress fell short of that intensely revolutionary situation.     The existence within the rankfc of elements, which are materially and spiritually bound up with reactionary socio-economic elements, wan responsible for this lamentable failure.
&quot;Our sympathy and support for the liberation of the Indian people are not confined to empty phrases;   therefore, it is not possible always to utter sweet ones.   The relation of the Communist International with the struggle of the oppressed peoples is based upon mutual interests and inspired by revolutionary idealism.   We must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Indian people in its struggle against Imperialism;   therefore we will fail in our revolutionary duty if we do not point out to you the mistake that weakens the movement.&quot;Indian National Congress stands in need of a thorough clarification of its idealogical background; its socio-economic outlook should cease to be confused;   and it should formulate a programme in accordance with the needs and demands of the great majority of the nation.   These conditions must be fulfilled if all the social forces objectively in conflict with imperialist domination are to be united in the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.&quot;In conclusion, we express our hope in the ultimate success of your cause, which means the destruction of British Imperialism by the revolutionary might of the Indian masses.&quot;DOM WITH BRITISH IMPERIALISM&quot; &quot;LONG 11 vE   THE FREE PEOPLE OP INDIA&quot;,INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST COLLABORATION    &apos;On the conclusion of the Mosoow Congress, Communist officials are turning their attention to smaller \international meetings:   A. IOsr of the French Coronunist Party has sent to the Communist pj;rty of Great Britain an invitation for a conference at Frankfurt on January 7th at which the agenda will be: Reparations.The political and economic situation of prance and Germany.The syndicalist movement.Organisation of opposition to the Treaty of Versailles.Inkpin and Gallaoher are to be the British delegates:the latter has been studying special issues of the&quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; tmd other relevant literature.The/
Tho Gorman Communist Party is holding a meeting inleipsig on January 28th and has asked the OomnunistParty of Groat Britain and other foreign Communist Partieto send representatives to assist in the consideration ofthe reports on,(1)   the recent congresses of the Comintern and Profintern,(2)   the United Front,(3)   activity in local government bodies and (a)   the Gorman Communist programme. When in Berlin last month, McManus informed Tom Bell that:&quot;Everybody seems very much concerned about the strike which is taking place at Lucir/igahafen, Badon, chiefly because it is the first effort of the Party fraction.   Evidently the Party control decided to call this strike and it is meeting with much more success than anybody anticipated.   How I think we would be doing a good bit of work if we could manage to make a grant to the strikers.   Comrades Stewart ana Whitehead will tell you about it and tell you about its significance here.   The French Party has granted 600,000 marks, approximately  18 and it has had a very good effect.   Can you do anything in this direction?   If you csin then send it to the Party Central committee to be forwarded to them.&quot;THE OOMHOHISTSThere is reason to believe that the Communist party of Great Britain has quite recently received anotherfinancial subsidy:   on December 19th Inkpin informed theScottish organiser that,&quot;It is quite impossible at the moment to hold out any hope that any financial responsibility in regard to the maintenance of these offices can be accepted by the Central Executive Committee.   Later on in the Hew Year the situation may alter, and it may then be possible to render some financial assistance, particularly if anything materialises in respect of the suggestion that a Scottish Divisional Council embracing the whole of the District Party Committees in the Scottish area shall continue to exist.&quot;This week additions have been made to several of theregular/
regular payments made from Headquarters.Albert Infer.in has betr deputed to attend the Congress at Birmingham on January livth at which the District Party Committee will be formed:   this Committee will cover Birmingham, Coventry, Smethwick, Walsall, West Bromwich, Volverbampton and Worcester.     In addition to representing the Executive at this Congress Inkpin will spend four or fjyo hours instructing the local officials in their new duties.In connection with the presence of Executive membersat District Congresses the following interestingcommunication was sent to the Scottish organiser by Inkpinon December 19th:&quot;I am asked to take the opportunity of pointing out that the assumption that the one appointed to attend the Congress on behalf of the Executive will necessarily be available to be turned on to do a public meeting on Sunday evening indicates a complete misconception of the purpose of sending Executive representatives to these District Party Congresses. If only those are appointed to attend these District Party Congresses who are available for public meetings, it would mean that the Exeoutlve Committee would be considerably restricted in the selection of those available for visiting the districts and initiating the work of reorganisation,   what is required for this purpose is a thorough knowledge of the principles underlying the new form of organisation, and not necessarily ability in the way of speaking.   Moreover, if the Executive representative has any time to spare on Sunday,   that time should be spent in discussions with the District Party Committee on the lines of their Immediate work, the selection of the personnel of the leading committees and the many problems of local party organisation to which the District Party Committee will have to get down immediately it. is appointed.   We are sure that your suggestion about a. meeting on Sunday was made with the best of intentions; but at the same time you will pardon us for pointing out that the mi stales of the past was to overemphasise the importance of public meetings and to pay too little attention to the work of organisation.   This mistake has got to be guarded against in the future if the new form of Party organisation is to have a fair chance and the Communist Party is to begin to make real progress.&quot;On December 20th, 1922, Inkpin informed, the Scottishorganiser/
organiser that: ox-&quot;Dutt will arrive in Glasgow on Friday morning and will proceed straight to your office at 196, St. Vincent Street.   In my telegram I asked you to make arrangements for a meeting on Friday of the members of the present Central Committee, together with other representative members in the Glasgow        I District, so that Dutt can have a talk with them about th6 new form of organisation and the functions and immediate tasks of the new District party Committee.    In a letter I had yesterday from Dutt he was anxious that arrangements should be made, if possible, for a meeting to be held of the members of the first training group to be set up in the Glasgow District, so that he would have an opportunity during his visit Of taking them through the first-course.&quot;On December 23rd the District Party Congress in Glasgow was attended by 32 delegates representing 16 branches:   R. Palme Dutt delivered a lengthy address on Party discipline and the following committee was elected:J.R. Campbell, A. Haimes, Alexander Park J. Logan Sadie Span V. McMillan, Aitken Ferguson Pinlay Hart.At the conclusion of the Congress the members of the Committee were told by Palme Dutt to &quot;go home and have tea and tell your people that you will be absent during the night&quot;:   when they returned Dutt detained them until 2 a.m. in order to deal, with the details of the new organisation.   The duties of members were allocated as follows:Organising Bureau:        A.. Ferguson,P. Hart, V.. McMillan S* Span.Political Bureau; J.R. Campbell,A. Eaimes, J, Logan, A. Park.Sadie Span was appointed seoretary and- C. Whitehead andV/. Denholme auditors.The Exeoutive Committee has decided that the congress to establish the Edinburgh District Committee shall b&amp; heldin/
in Edinburgh on January 20th:   the arrangements appear to he in the hands of Aitken Ferguson.Moscow&apos;s instructions regarding the education of prospective and budding communists are being put into effect in the London area:   the outline of the scheme is as follows:-&quot;BAffjgY TRADTIHG&quot;The above Department has been set up at Headquarters, under the voluntary direction of Comrade george Deacon (Central Executive Committee), and has for its aim the initiation and management of the Party&quot;a Beheme for training members as roughly outlined in the Report of the Commission adopted at the Battersea Congress.&quot;An abridged syllabus will be found in that Report and thi3 will givo an idea of the scope of the training sehese.   This syllabus is being worked out in dotail and, vrtien completed, will act as a handbook for leaders and students alike.   This will not be ready for some time yet, but we are arranging to issue shortly the syllabus for the first three or four courses to onable the work to proceed. Meantime group leaders will utilise the headings of present abridged syllabus.&quot;The party training groups must not be confused with other present-day workers&apos; educational classes. Even where the latter are distinctly &quot;working--class1 in character they do not fulfil the needs of our Party, the education being rather general in character,&quot;Our groups are based upon the obvious fact that the Party must train its own members for Party purposes.&quot;jit the moment a few advance groups are being set up in ceruain districts, but other groups will be formed almost immediately all over the country. A false start, however, would be unfortunate.   It is therefore recpumonded that no group be set up without consuitavion with the Head Office or corresponding District Committee.,&quot;Wo group should exceed twelve members in the interests of efficiency,, and for practical purposes the membership will noed to go through the scheme in relays. Ultimately the training scheme will be for new and probationary members but at present all members should go ihrough training.   The first groups should contain the most active and responsible Party members drawn from all the activities of the party, and particularly should members be chosen who, in their turn, are capable of acting as leaders for future groups.&quot;The Education Bureau met at Jiing Street on December2 8th/
18th and decided that in addition to the Training Groups outlined above, an &quot;Instructors1 Group&quot; should be formed at King Street immediately:   the women&apos;s Training Group is to be revived shortly.Communists are beginning to fear the possibility of a British movement boing started on lines similar to the Fascisti movement in Italy:   they fear that they may be forced to work underground.   In Glasgow the communists say that a branch of Fascist! has been formed and that this will provide an oxouss for them to arm.Regarding the Dundee parliamentary contest Gallaoher has informed a comrade that &quot;Old Pal Trotsky has sent word across regretting that I did not get in.     They say that I must get in so it&apos;s up to us to see that there&quot;a no mistako next time.&quot;Dick Beech, who left this country in an Arcos boat, was in Petrograd in November and expects to be home this month.COMMONISM IN THE TRAPS UNIONSEvidence is accumulating of communist attempts topermeate the trade unions on the lines laid down by Mosoowin tho &quot;Decisions of the Third Congress of the ThirdInternational&quot;:   the following circulars were issued fromheadquarters to District Industrial Committees onDecember 20th;&quot;The Amalgamated society of woodworkers will, early in the New Year, re-elect its General Secretary, in addition to the Executive Committee, delegates to Congresses, etc.    It has been suggested that Comrade Strain would meet with a certain amount of support as a candidate for the post of General Secretary.   I shall be glad if you will let me know what are the possibilities of hie oandidature receiving support -in Glasgow, and in the Union generally.&quot;&quot;Comrade Robert Purcell, of 67, West View   &apos;4oad, Barrow, a member of the Burrow Branch of the Commtoist-Pferty, has been nominated for the Executive Committee..of/
