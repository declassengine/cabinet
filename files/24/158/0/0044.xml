^^kNES (WORKING FACILITIES AND SUPPORT) BILL. K23))SO r.&apos; psffrandum by Secretary for Mines - 24th&apos;January 1823.The attached Bill and explanatory memorandum-are circulated te the Home Affairs Committee by the instructions of the Prudent of the Board of Trade.The Bill is founded upon the recommendations contained in the third report (dated April 1919) of tho Acquisition and Valuation of Land Committee&apos; of ,which. Sir Leslie -Scott wor chairman,, and though&apos; Part I is shorn of the mare - ar-r-aa^Mnp and contentious - proposals contained in that report, it is sull a Bill of great importance to the mining industries and&quot; more&quot; &apos;idirectly to the Railways.     Not only willso far as ItI - mdgoes, add to available mineral resources, conduce to their mire efficient working, and increase employment, but it will do much towards depriving the advocates of nationalisation of minerals of their most effective arguments.An outline of the proposals of the Bill has been unanimously approved by the Coal Advisory Committee of the Mines Department and I am able to submit it on tho footing that it will be an agreed measure.     For though there are still one or two points upon which complete agreement has not yet been- reached between the interests who aro directly concerned - (reference is made to these points in the accompanying memorandum) - discuss ion?, upon them are still proceeding and.I have every confidence   in their outcome.At the same time the negotiations have been   long   and difficult and I am doubtful whether I could hold the par-ties together indefinitely.     The fact that at&apos; this moment agreement has practically been reached&apos;is due very largely to the   help and influence of Sir Leslie Scott; an: and even generousadopted.. I &quot;fear that any delay in pasting the Bill into Law would seriously jeopardise the measure of agreement   which nowto the very, reasonable -xttltude which the Railway Companies   haveexit-the R-ai.Companies in fact have offered certain concessions on the definite condition that there is. no delay -and I consider it very important therefore that time should be found fcr this Bill during the forthcoming session.:. LANE-FOX.B..1I L
MineWorking Facilities &amp; Support) Bill.Memorandum by Mines Department, 24-th January, 1925.This Bill is the outcome of several years&apos; negotiation between representatives of Mine Owners, Owners of Mining Royalties and Railway Companies. Mr. Bridgeman, when Secretary for Mines, undertook to embody the result of these negotiations in a Government Bill and to use his best endeavours to   get it passed next Session.     The negotiations had their origin in the decision of the House of Lords in Howley Park Coal and Cannel Company v London &amp; North Western Railway Company, (1913) which, as explained later in this memorandum, knocked the bottom   out of the Mining C6de of the Railway Clauses Consolidation   Act, 1845.     Their sc6pe was later enlarged by the&apos; recommendations contained in the. third report of the Acquisition add Valuation of Land Committee of which Sir Leslie SCott Was chairman.The Bill is divided into two parts.     The object of both is to facilitate the working of minerals, but this is the only feature common to them.Part I.The Acquisition and Valuation of Land Committee (1919) called attention to certain ways in which the private ownership of minerals unduly hampered the proper developient of   the country&apos;s mineral resources, and proposed to remedy this by setting up machinery through which compulsory orders might be obtained in suitable cases .     The Committee on the Non-Ferrous Mining Industry (1920) supported this recommendation   with certain modifications.     The Coal Industry Commission, 1919, had under consideration the handicap to development arising from these causes, but they proposed a different remedy, viz., the acquisition of royalties by the State,Two abortive attempts have already   been made for legislation on the lines recommended by the Acquisition and Valuation of Land Committee.     Lord Gainford in 1920 introduced a Bill in.the House of Lords proposing to.set up a &quot;sanctioning Authority&quot; to which &quot;anyone interested in the production   and development of minerals   might apply for a compulsory   order to remove any impediment to the production or development   of minerals &quot;contrary to the national interest&quot;.     This Bill passed through all its stages in the House iif Lords without amendment, but the Government could not, of course, support it   in   the House of Commons as they were committed to the alternative plan of purchase of royalties by the State.     The Law&apos;of Property Bill as originally introduced contained a clause dealing   with one aspect of the question, viz., conflict of interest between persons whose consent is necessary to the working of minerals. But the Lord Chancellor, after consultation with the interests concerned, decided to drop this clause on the   understanding that a Bill dealing more fully with the same subject would be introduced later.In,order to make the present Bill as far as possible non-contentious, the proposals contained in Part I   fall far short of those recommended by   Sir Leslie Scott1,s Committee, some of which, howeverf they might have   been regarded four   years ago, would be   clearly repugnant to   the public opinion   of
,   dayXt     The Bill follows the precedent of the Acquisition    c ? of&quot;Land Act and the Ministry of Transport Act, as well as the recommendation of the Non-Ferrous Committee, in making the Railway and Canal Commission the Tribunal to decide, within the limits of the discretion conferred upon them by the Bill, whether a case is a proper one for a compulsory order.     The general limit on their discretion is that they can only recommend a compulsory order when the right asked for cannot be obtained by negotiations for one of the reasons specified in Clause 4 - i.e. briefly, that the persons having power to grant them are numerous, or have   conflicting interests, or cannot be found or ascertained, or have not   the necessary powers of disposition, or unreasonably refuse to grant the rights.     The rights which may be obtained by   compulsory order include both the right to work minerals and also   rights ancillary to their proper working.    (These latter are enumerated in Clause 3(2)) .     For each of these two classes cf rights special limits, as well as the general limits mentioned above, are set to the Commissioners&apos; discretion.   The right to work minerals   can only be granted either (a) in respect of minerals in which   the applicant has an interest, or minerals adjoining them,   which, without a compulsory order are in danger of being left permanently unworked, or (b) for a rectification of boundaries tin which   both the lessees concerned are agreed.     Ancillary rights can only be granted where the 11 proper and efficient working of the minerals is unduly hampered&quot; for want of them.If the Commission, after hearing the case, come to   the conclusion that the necessary conditions are fulfilled, and that the case is a proper one for a compulsory order, they will make a recommendation accordingly, fixing the compensation   &quot;on the basis.of what would be fair and reasonable between a willing grantor and a willing grantee&quot; and it will then be for the Board of Trade &quot;if they consider it expedient in the public interest to do so&quot; to make an order conferring the right.The Bill also contains provisions that, conversely,a right of support may be conferred in suitable cases   on   persons interested in the surface (Clause 9)K.All these provisions have been agreed between the mine owners and the royalty owners except one which is still under discussion, viz., the precise nature of the restriction which is to be placed on the Commissioners1 discretion in granting ancillary rights. As the Bill was originally drawn the condition that the minerals must be   &quot;in danger of being left permanently unworked&quot;, applied to ancillary rights   as   well   as the right to work   minerals. But   it was pointed out   that this condition   could   seldom, if ever,   be   shewn   to   be   fulfilled   in   a&quot;^For instance, the Committee proposed to* entrust very wide powers to their sanctioning authority.     An application for a compulsory order might be made &quot;wherever the best development of&apos;the National Resources is impeded by private property&quot;.     they also recommended that the Mines Department should have a general supervision over the lay out and working of coal fields, with power to apply for a compulsory order to prevent uneconomic working,, and even, in the last resort, to take over and work collieries itself.nThe other proposals made by Sir Leslie Scott&apos;s Committee for aealmg with the question of subsidence, however valuable on merits, are not practicable at present.   They depend upon the formation ofn insurance, fund, and such a fund cannot be created without some extraneous financial backing.   This cannot be, forthcoming without imposition of a fresh burden upon either &quot;the taxpayer, theatepayer, the mineral worker or the mineral owner.     This is fatal.

case where the application was for ancillary rights, and to impose it would therefore be to render the provisions under, this head, nugatory.     The Mine Owners agree to the substitution of the &quot;unduly hampered.&quot; test,     The Royalty Owners have under consideration the question whether they are prepared to accept this or wish to propose something more stringent.Part II.Part II relates solely to minerals adjacent to railways. The position that it is designed to meet is briefly as follows,Under the common law every land owner (unless he has voluntarily parted with it) has a right of lateral support - iae. support from the minerals in land adjoining bis own - and may obtain an injunction to prevent them from being worked in such a manner as to let down his own land,.     In the case of railways, however, this right of lateral support is dealt with by statule (the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845)..   The gist of that statute is that railways may, in order to secure support, require minerals to be left unworked up to 40 yards on each side of the railway on payment of proper compensation.     Deeper mining has long rendered this 40 yards limit inadequate to ensure protection of the railway.     But until 1913 it was thought that the Statutor right took the place of the common law right and that any owner pr lessee of minerals had full right to work the minerals up to the 40 yards limit without any liability for any damage that might be caused to the railway.     The decision in Howley Park and Cannel Company v0 The London &amp; North Western Railway Company was, however, to the effect that the Railway Company possessed a common law right of lateral support from minerals outside the 40 yards and could obtain an injunction to prevent their being worked so as to endanger the railway.     Two results have followed from this decision.     First, a great deal of mineral has been sterilised which might safely be worked and ought to be worked. Secondly, it has produced in the mine owners a willingness to negotiate with the railway companies, which was conspicuously absent before 1913,This Bill repeals the relevant sections of the Railway Clauses (Consolidation) Act and re-enacts them on lines agreed between the railway companies; mine owners and royalty owners, The upshot of this agreement is that the railway companies give up their common law right of support in return for an extension of the 40 yards limit varying in accordance with the depth of the mineral being worked,&quot;and that the mine owners and royalty owners accept a share of the liability for any damage done to the railway by the authorised working of minerals within that limit.One or two points of detail still remain to be accepted by one or other of the parties, but only one of these contains the possibility of serious disagreement.     This arises from the unwillingness that the royalty owners are showing to accept what everyone else regards as the obvious and necessary consequences of their agreement to bear a certain part of the liability for damage done to the railway by the working of minerals set free by this Bill,     This too is now under consideration by them.
