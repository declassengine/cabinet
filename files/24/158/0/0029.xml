[This Document is the Property of His-Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   Januarij 1923.SECRET..CP. 29 (23). ,CABINET. \SIR HUGH LANE&apos;S PICTURES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE question of the ultimate disposal of certain pictures owned by the late Sir Hugh Lane has again been raised.It may be remembered that under his original Will, Sir Hugh Lane bequeathed these pictures to the National Gallery, which has since been responsible for their custody. By a codicil, which was not properly witnessed, he transferred the bequest to the City of Dublin. The full history of the case is described in the following Cabinet Papers : 1. Note by Mr. Macpherson (then Chief Secretary for Ireland) covering Memo-randiun from a deputation.   (G.T. 7823.) 2. Memorandum by the Trustees of the National Gallery.   (G.T. 8283.) 3. Extract from Minutes of 43rd Meeting of the Committee of Home Affairs.(H.A.C. 43 (2).)4. Extract from Conclusions of a Conference of Ministers held on the 17th Novem-ber, 1919. -5. Memorandum by Viscount Long (then First Lord of the Admiralty.) (CP. 162.)1 am advised that the legal position is not free from ambiguity ; it appears, however, that if, as is being urged in certain quarters, the pictures are to be handed over to the City of Dublin in accordance with Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s desire, as expressed in the codicil, legislation will be necessary to empower the National Gallery Trustees to. dispose of their responsibility for them.It has been suggested that an independent Commission of three should be appointed by Government to hear evidence and report on the equity of the case. In the circumstances I recommend that this suggestion be adopted.DEVONSHIRE.January 22, 1923.[9390]
