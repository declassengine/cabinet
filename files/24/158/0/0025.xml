[THIS. DOCUMENT IS TILE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY.&apos;S. OpVBRNMBMT.SECRET^CABINET. Copy No.- 1CP.25 (55) v *AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS, 3ILtj. Memorendum by the &quot;Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries-I desire the authority of the Cabinet for the introduction of the Agricultural Holdings Bill.     This Bill is a purely consolidating measure and, with the exception of such drafting amendments as are necessitated by the passing of the Allotments Act, 1922, it follows the lines of the Bill which passed through the House of Lords in the flrs&quot;t   Session of 1922 and lapsed on the dissolution of the late Parliament.The Bill was prepared by my predecessor as the result of an undertaking given during the passage of the Agriculture Act, 1920, and I am advised that it is very desirable that the consolidation of the various enactments relating to Agricultural Holdings should be proceeded with as soon as possible.   Unless the Committee so desire I do not propose to circulate a draft of the Bill.
