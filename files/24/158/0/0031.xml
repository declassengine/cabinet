COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL CREDIT.REPORT.To Lieut.-Colonel the Right Hon.Sir Robert A. Sanders, Bt., T.D., M.P.Sir,1. We were invited by your predecessor on the 13th October, 1922, to serve as a Sub-Committee of an Agricultural Committee of the late Cabinet for the purpose of enquiring into the adequacy of the credit facilities available for agriculturists in Great Britain at the present time and to make recommendations. You have intimated your desire and that of His Majesty&apos;s present Government that we should continue and complete our investigations.2. The original terms of our reference were : (a.) To examine the means available for the provision of cheaper credit for landowners to be used in. productive capital works, such as buildings, drainage, reclamations, &amp;c, and for the provision of short-term credits for farmers to enable them to continue operations.(b.) To examine the question whether these two objects could best be attained by the establishment, with State assistance, of co-operative Land Banks, and, if so, to elaborate a scheme for the establishment of such Land Banks, and a draft of the constitution of these banks, which could be used in legislation to be introduced next Session.(c.) To report to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on the above subjects, not later than the 4th November, 1922. -3. With regard to (c), we have since been informed that our deliberations could take the normal course which the dimensions and importance of the subject required, and that the submission of a report by the 4th November was no longer regarded as essential.4. We are glad to have had this latitude, without which it would have been impossible to carry out a comprehensive survey of the credit facilities at present available for agriculturists or to form any considered judgment as to their sufficiency.5. We have held twenty-one meetings, and have heard evidence from all parts of Great Britain covering all branches of the industry and all types and classes of agriculturists. We have consulted representatives of the Banks, the Development Commission and various Government Departments.6. We now beg to present the following Report: I. Introduction.The Function of Credit and the Part that Credit Plays in Agriculture.7. The cultivation of the ground, including the harvesting of crops and the rearing and management of live-stock, is not only the oldest, but the most widely dispersed occupation of civilised man. The interval between seed time and harvest, between the rearing and killing of beasts, probably necessitated in the earliest times the use of some system of credit. Indeed, it may be assumed that agriculture gave birth to the conception of credit. It is therefore natural that credit should have come to be regarded by the farmer as an essential element in the productive process. Although there has been a tendency in most countries to isolate &quot;agricultural credit&quot; and to treat it as a peculiar credit problem demanding special consideration, fundamentally credit plays the same part in agriculture as it does in any other industry. Credit has been aptly defined as supplying the means whereby the transfer of wealth from one person to another is effected for a period of time,[9393] b 2
at the end of which it is restored to its owner. Credit cannot directly increase the actual means of production which are potentially at the service of mankind, but credit machinery can and does transfer from one individual to another the right to use these means, and - it is therefore both natural and relatively accurate from the individual point of view to regard credit as an important agent in the productive process. Nevertheless, credit is merely another name for someone else&apos;s money.8. An essential factor in credit is trust or confidence in the return to the original owner of the money which has been temporarily placed at the service of the borrower. . It.is obvious, therefore, that such credit as is available in a country will tend to flow into those channels from which its return will be most certain. Other things being equal, credit will find its way to those who possess the highest credentials and offer the greatest security for the repayment of advances. Now agriculture, though commonly spoken of as though it were a - homogeneous industry, covers an immense field of diversified occupations and businesses, in which men of every degree of financial position, skill and condition of life are engaged, and in discussing agricultural credit it is useful to begin by dissociating the conception of credit from the industry of agriculture taken as a whole and to realise that the flow of credit will depend upon the individual factors in each individual case. The precise occupation of the would-be borrower, or the purpose for which he seeks credit, will generally be a lesser consideration in the mind of the hypothetical lender than factors such as the borrower&apos;s personal character and general financial circumstances. The agriculturist who is in possession of sufficient personal wealth in one form or another, whether it be in real estate, abundance of stock, or income-producing securities of a readily marketable character, will normally find little difficulty in mobilising a portion of his fixed wealth by borrowing upon its security, thus obtaining by credit the means to carry out those operations which may be said to be within his means without disturbing his own capital. On the. other hand, the impecunious or impoverished producer who may be lacking in skill and character will, if he wishes to undertake an operation on borrowed money, find it difficult, if not impossible, to secure the necessary credit. Between these two extremes lie every possible gradation of case. At the same time, it has to be admitted that there are men with skill and enterprise, good health and abundant energy who, with adequate financial resources, would be in a position to undertake successfully operations which they are unable to carry out for lack of means. There are many such to be found in the ranks of agriculturists men who have all the qualifications which make for success but who cannot, under existing conditions, obtain the necessary capital. These are the type for whose assistance the State may consider it desirable to promote more adequate credit machinery than exists to-day.9. &quot;We recognise that it is not only in the industry of agriculture that such types may be found, and we are not unmindful of the argument that it is not a proper function of the State to provide money to assist private enterprise. We feel, however, that the case of the agriculturist presents special features entitling him to exceptional and preferential consideration. In the very nature of things the agriculturist is often isolated and remote from the normal opportunities for obtaining credit. Compared with those of the manufacturer and the trader, his operations are complex, long-in their cycle and subject to exceptional risks from weather and disease beyond the ordinary ups and downs of prices and wages which he suffers in common with industrialists. For the greater part of the year, and especially when he is most in need of credit, his capital is sunk in forms of wealth, difficult for anyone but an expert to value and not readily chargeable as security for an advance, while his personal training and method of life are not such as to fit him to surmount these natural disadvantages and to establish that position in the credit market to which his financial stability and high standard of probity generally entitle him. But beyond all these considerations, the deep importance to the welfare of the nation of a prosperous agriculture warrants a peculiar interest being devoted by the State to the financial position of the food producer, an interest all the more necessary in a country whose population is predominantly engaged in urban pursuits and,
consequently, slow to appreciate, except in times of grave national peril, the significance of agricultural prosperity to the wellrbeing of the nation as a whole.10. The fundamental difficulty in devising any system of credit for agriculture lies to-day in the uncertainty of the economic outlook. As we have already said, trust and confidence are the essence of credit, but the market prices of many agricultural products have recently fallen below the cost of production and production continued under such conditions spells loss and ultimate bankruptcy. Without collateral security credit is shy of such conditions. The effect of establishing a widespread system of easily obtainable credit for an industry that is sick, while it is still sick, may be to throw good money after bad and instead of proving a boon it may well accentuate the disease.11. It is also of the utmost importance that the country as a whole and the agricultural interests in particular should not be led to believe that in easily obtainable credit there lies a panacea for the ills from which agriculture suffers to-day. What is of vital importance is that agriculture should be made to pay. Credit alone cannot convert an unprofitable industry into a profitable one. Credit may enable an individual to make a certain operation pay which might not otherwise pay, or might not otherwise be undertaken at all, and the price which the producer has to pay for credit may just turn the scale towards profit or loss in his own case. Viewed in this way, credit may be an important factor in the cost of production in individual cases, but it is mainly in other directions that a solution must be sought of the difficult problem of how agriculture generally can be made to pay, and these lie beyond our province. We were appointed to consider within very limited terms of reference specific questions as to the availability of credit in certain cases, and we have confined our attention to these matters. But we feel bound to point out that to the extent that agriculture can be made to pay it will tend to attract naturally both capital and credit. What British agriculture really needs is not the expedient of artificially created credit, but to be placed on such a footing that credit and capital will flow into the industry through normal channels stimulated by that trust and confidence without which credit ceases to be credit and becomes a species of dole.II. Analysis or Ceedit Needs.12. The normal credit requirements of agriculturists can be broadly divided into the two classes referred to in our terms of reference, namely : (1.) Long-term credit-(A.) For landowners, to be used&apos; in productive capital works.(B.) For tenant farmers purchasing the freehold of their farms.(2.) Short-term credit for farmers to meet current outgoings and to facilitate the production and the marketing of their products.It is essential to a proper understanding of the subject to consider these two main classes of credit in some detail, and it will be convenient to deal with them separately.III. Long-Tebm Credit.(A.) Credit for Improvements.18. Long-term credit for improvements is required by land-owners from time to time for various capital works, such as drainage, reclamation, the erection and extension of farm buildings and cottages and the provision of water supply. Many landowners, even in pre-war days, could not meet the cost of these works out of current income, and, owing to increased taxation and to the increased cost of living, very few can do so to-day. Money for these purposes is, of course, often raised by bank loans or overdrafts, or by private mortgages, but it has long been recognised that this class of business presented a promising field of activity for special
institutions. The General Land Drainage Company was formed for this purpose under statutory authority in 1849, the Lands Improve; ment Company in 1853, the Scottish Drainage and Improvement Company in 1856 and the Land Loan and Enfranchisement Company in 1860. The Lands Improvement Company has since absorbed the first and last of these undertakings. The Improvement of- Land Act, which was passed in 1864, authorised landowners to raise loans and to charge their estates in the same way as provided tinder the Acts of the various Companies referred to. The Lands Improvement Company has advanced during the seventy years of its existence some  13,000,000, and so far few, if any, losses have been incurred. During the war the business of the Company was practi-cally suspended, partly owing to the rate of interest chargeable on loans being limited under Statute by a maximum of 5 per cent, and partly owing to the general discouragement of avoidable expenditure on works of this character. The operations of the Scottish Company were suspended for the same reasons. In 1920 the English Company was successful in obtaining an amending Act (10 &amp; 11 Geo. T, c. 11), the effect of which was to replace the old maximum rate of 5 per cent, by such rate of interest as the Ministry of Agriculture may approve.   The English Company also operates in Scotland.14. The business of the Lands Improvement Company has revived considerably since the war and it is performing a useful function. Its modus operandi is very simple, and it is worthy of note that small owners are now making more use of the Company than formerly. Money is advanced for the erection and extension of farm buildings and cottages, for the making of roads, sewers, drains, &amp;c, and for the erection of silos. Applications received from landowners are forwarded to the Ministry of Agriculture, or, in the case of Scotland, to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, for the issue of a Provisional Order that the property concerned will prima facie be improved at least to the extent of the proposed increased charge. An inspector of the Department visits the property, and, if his report is satisfactory, a Provisional Order is issued. This is the authority to proceed. On the completion of the work, the Department concerned, after further inspection, issues a final certificate making the capital sum advanced a charge, on the property ranking, prior to existing mortgages and settlements, but after quit rents, Crown rents or tithe rent-charge payable out of the land. The interest of the holders of prior charges are fully safe-guarded by this process of statutory certification. The loans are repayable by an annuity over a prescribed period which varies from fifteen to forty years, according to the nature of the improvement, interest being charged at present at 4^ per cent, net, after deduc-tion of tax, which represents a gross rate of about 6 per cent, per annum. In addition, the Company charges 5 per cent, commission on the total sum advanced, and the Department a fee of \ per cent, on the cost of the work and also the expenses of inspection. These expenses, together with the cost of registration and stamp duty, are added to the capital sum borrowed. No proof of title is required, a certificate of the receipt of rents and profits being the only evidence asked foi and the whole business is carried through with private capital without any State guarantee.15. We were informed that the mortgages contracted are readily assignable to leading insurance companies, and it will be seen therefore that the resources of the Lands Improvement Company are practically unlimited, whilst from the point of view of security its advances are in almost every case covered many times over by the total value of the properties concerned. In view of the first-class nature of the securities offered, credit flows normally and easily into the business.16. We endorse the view expressed in 1918 by the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee that the principle underlying the Improvement of Land Act is sound. We can conceive of no method on an economic basis for the provision of capital for permanent improvements which would be more advan-tageous than that by which the Lands Improvement Company operates. In view of the ample security offered, we are inclined to think that the Company ought now to be able to borrow money at about 5 per cent., but in all other respects the arrangements seem to us to be satisfactory.
17. Under the general statute other organisations may establish machinery, find money for this kind of business and operate under the aigis of the State as in the case of the existing Company. The drawback, however, is the fixed rate of interest of 5 per cent, in the general statute. As previously stated, the Lands. Improvement Company has obtained special statutory authority to charge a rate in excess of this figure, and hence, to that extent, the Company is virtually in a monopolistic position at the present time. We see no reason to suppose that this is operating in any way adversely to the general interests of borrowers. Applications for loans appear io receive prompt attention and no reasonable applications are refused. On the receipt of the Ministry&apos;s certificate, money is advanced without delay and, if necessary, during the actual progress of the work. We have, however, been impressed by the fact that land-owners do not avail themselves more largely and generally of the Lands Improvement Company&apos;s aid. No doubt, in many cases, landowners, other than tenants for life, feel some repugnance at imposing burdens of a recurring nature on their estates. On the other hand, we feel that the facilities which the Company is in a position to offer would be more frequently used if they were better understood and more universally known.Recommendations.18. We recommend that the Improvement of Land Acts should be amended to empower any association operating under those statutes to charge such rate of interest as the Ministry of Agricul-ture or the Board of Agriculture for Scotland may approve. We also recommend that the Lands Improvement Company should be urged to consider the means of bringing the scope and advantages of its operations more prominently before the notice of the owners of agricultural estates than is the case at the present time.IV. Long-Teem Credit. (B.) For Land Purchase.19. There is a further class of long-term credit demand which has been accentuated by the peculiar circumstances of those tenant farmers who, having purchased their holdings during recent years, now find themselves in consequence short of working capital. We are aware that such credit cannot normally be strictly deemed agricultural credit. It is, in fact, pure Land Mortgage, and is in quite a different category from credit for agricultural purposes. We were not specifically directed by our terms of reference to consider this phase of the credit problem, but we feel that the &quot; short-term &quot; needs of these men for agricultural purposes are so intimately bound up with the depletion of their resources due to purchase that it is impossible to consider the one question without being brought face to face with the other.20. The owner-occupier is in the same position as the landowner in that he has, in his land, an absolutely first-class security to offer. The difficulty, however, in his case is that no adequate machinery has been established in this country for the purpose of granting long-term loans on real estate of which tenant farmers who have bought or wish to buy their holdings can avail themselves, and, consequently, a large number of the new owner-occupiers in the country have pledged their title-deeds as security for temporary loans of uncertain duration which they raised in order to complete their purchases. The problem is one to which we have devoted very careful consideration, and we feel it desirable to draw attention to the special features of the case as they have presented themselves to us.Recent Increase in Occupying-Ownership in Great Britain.21. The Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for 1921 (England and Wales) reveal an increase of over 21,000 in the number of holdings owned or mainly owned by their occupiers as compared with 191.4. The increase in acreage owned is over 21 millions. In Scotland, the number of owner-occupiers has increased by about 1,600 during the same period. The majority of these purchases took place between June 1919 and June 1921. The

We also recommend that the, Lands Improvement Company should be urged to consider the means of bringing the scope and advantages of its operations more prominently before the notice of the owners of agricultural estates than is the ease at the present time.IV. Long-Teem Cbbdit. (B.) For Land Purchase.19. There is a further class of long-term credit demand which has been accentuated by the peculiar circumstances of those tenant farmers who, having purchased their holdings during recent years, now find themselves in consequence short of working capital. We are aware that such credit cannot normally be strictly deemed agricultural credit. It is, in fact, pure Land Mortgage, and is in quite a different category from credit for agricultural purposes. We were not specifically directed by our terms of reference to consider this phase of the credit problem, but we feel that the &quot; short-term &quot; needs of these men for agricultural purposes are so intimately bound up with the depletion of their resources due to purchase that it is impossible to consider the one question without being brought face to face with the other.20.

The problem is one to which we have devoted very careful consideration, and we feel.it desirable to draw attention to the special features of the case as they have presented themselves to us.Recent Increase in Occupying-Ownership in Great Britain.21. The Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for 1921 (England and Wales) reveal an increase of over 21,000 in the number of holdings owned or mainly owned by their occupiers as compared with 1914. The increase in acreage owned is over 2  millions. In Scotland, the number of owner-occupiers has increased by about 1,600 during the same period. The majority of these purchases took place between June 1919 and June 1921.  The
latest statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture, compiled from returns dated the 3rd June&apos;, 1922, show that this figure of 21,000 new owner-occupiers for England and Wales had undergone a reduction during the preceding year by about one-third and now stands at approxi-mately 13,500, while the acreage involved had been reduced from 21 millions to 1,700,000 acres. We mention these figures in order primarily to show that the special problem of credit for the new owner-occupier is not one of large dimensions, but stands within well-defined limits. We think also that the somewhat surprising reduction in the number of new owner-occupiers referred to may not be withdut significance and may point to the possibility of certain purchasers having bought with the intention of reselling and having since been obliged to let the farms, and also to some of the owner-occupiers having been forced to retire from farming owing to its general unprofitability and to the new and onerous obligations which they, in many cases, unavoidably assumed in circumstances of. extreme difficulty.Economic Reasons for the Increase in Occupying Ownership.22. The increase in occupying-ovmership arose mainly from the necessity with which landowners were confronted of selling their estates and diverting their capital to a remunerative form of investment. This, of itself, was no new feature. Indeed, as far back as 1911 a marked increase was noticeable in the number of agricultural estates offered for sale. This increase was considered then to be partly due to a feeling of apprehension among landowners as to the tendency of legislation and taxation in regard to land, and partly to the opportunities then existing of disposing of agricultural estates on favourable terms. The crushing demands of war taxation hastened the process and many landowners saw in the general rise in the value of agricultural real estate an opportunity to relieve themselves of the unremunerative duties of ownership and to sell their estates on a rising market at considerable personal advantage. Increased returns could no doubt have been obtained by raising rents, but farmers, as a whole, had shown some hostility to the proposal, and for personal reasons many landowners. hesitated to take this course. The keen demand which, on the other hand, had existed since 1910 for the purchase of farms had been stimulated during the war by the prevailing high prices and the prospects of continued prosperity. The resultant competition among purchasers-was, moreover, increased in 1919 and 1920 by the entry into the market of the County Councils, who bought extensively for purposes of Land Settlement. We consider, therefore, that farmers were as much pressed to purchase by the keenness of the demand for land for occupation as they were by the landowners who wished to sell. In many cases they bought in order to avoid being turned out of the homes which their families had occupied for generations.Political Factors.23. The political circumstances must be considered in the light of their reaction from a business standpoint. During the war, the whole nation demanded a maximum output of foodstuffs from the land. The successful prosecution of the war was the dominating circumstance. Farmers were urged to increase their acreage under the plough and were promised security against resultant losses. These promises were confirmed by. legislation, firstly and temporarily in 1917, and finally, as a feature of permanent agricultural policy, in December 1920. When the Corn Production Act of 1917 was before the House of Commons, farmers were assured that &quot;whatever befalls, agriculture will never again be neglected by any Government.&quot; In October 1919 a speech delivered by the late Prime Minister at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, gave farmers reasonable assurance that the prices of the staple products of their farms would be maintained at a level which, if markets fell, would, at least, safeguard them against serious loss. It was in accordance with this spirit that the Agriculture Act of 1920 was placed upon the Statute Book. In the case of wheat and pats, the Act established, for a period of at least five years, guaranteed minimum prices on a sliding scale based on the 1919 costs of production. These statutory guarantees were repealed in 1921 on grounds of financial exigency.
24. There is, in our opinion, little doubt that in certain individual cases purchasers were directly influenced by the Corn Production and Agriculture Acts if not actually to embark on ownership, at any rate to pay a higher price for their farms than in other circumstances they would have been prepared to offer. In this connection, a special Sub-Committee of the statutory Agricultural Advisory Committee for England and Wales which considered this question in February 1922 reported that &quot; the plea that the farmer was induced to buy his land by the representations made by the Government has undoubtedly a solid foundation.&quot; In these circum-stances it follows that where it is claimed that individual farmers definitely bought on the strength of the Government guarantees no satisfactory reply can, from the nature of things, be made, and where such men are now in a serious financial condition as a result of their new commitments, the case for the most sympathetic consideration of their difficulties is similarly unanswerable. We are reinforced in this view by the following extract from a speech which the present Prime Minister made in the House of Commons on the 5th December last, when he said: &quot;Then there is another evil, almost as important, which requires a remedy. As the result of our Agricultural Bill, apart from the general evils from which our farmers are suffering, they were encouraged to buy their farms at what are now absurdly high prices. They are suffering from it terribly, and, therefore, credit facilities are needed, not only for them, but all round.&quot;Financial Situation of the Nero Owner-Occupiers.25. It is obvious that as farmers, generally, are in a difficult position at the present time, the financial situation of many of the new owner-occupiers, some of whom were driven into ownership without an opportunity for mature consideration, must be even more precarious. In this connection, the following factors are important: 26. (a.) Price at ichich Land was Bought. It is impossible to fix any universally applicable figure as an index of the degree of inflation in the value of agricultural land during the recent selling boom. Prices varied from month to month, from county to county, and from farm to farm. In some parts of England land was sold for  25 and  30 an acre which was worth  20 an acre before 1914. In Lincolnshire, the price of land advanced in some cases over 50 per cent, above the pre-war figure. In other cases farmers paid fancy prices with insufficient regard to prospective values. Taking everything into consideration, there is no doubt that the war-time prosperity of the industry, coupled with the Government guarantees, resulted in a general rise in the value of agricultural real estate, and that the new owner-occupiers, in most cases, bought on the basis of this enhanced value and, in some eases, at prices far in excess. It should be noted, however, that the price of land did not rise to anything like the same extent as the prices of commodities generally.27. (b.) Extent to which Money was Borrowed from Various Sources. Apart from the comparatively few cases in which farms were bought outright, either from accumulated capital entirely or from accumulated capital combined with a sacrifice of some of the movable equipment of the farm such as live-stock, &amp;c, the more important sources of accommodation were as follows : Banks. There is evidence that in England and Wales nearly one-half of the purchase money in the aggregate was advanced by the Banks. In Scotland, on the other hand, the Banks did not lend on heritable security to such a great extent. The English Banks lent money freely by means of overdrafts. This source of credit had many attractions for the farmer. Secrecy was ensured, and the arrangements were elastic, the loan being repayable in. instalments at convenience. Moreover, the initial expenses were negligible as compared with a legally-drawn mortgage. The Banks appear to have lent anything up to the full price of the farms according to circumstances, though usually there was a margin of at least 25 per cent, which the farmer found from his own resources.Relatives and Friends. The probability is that the purchase of many farms was made on a purely family basis. . This is a time-honoured and well-known method of raising money amongst the[9393] o
farming community. In individual cases few, if any, persons outside the family know the proportions of the loan, or its conditions, until a death occurs or a settlement has to be made for other reasons. This source of credit possesses all the advantages of secrecy and cheapness associated with bank overdrafts.Solicitors (as an investment for Trustee-funds).-Loans raised from Trustee-funds amounted in the aggregate to considerable sums of money. They were contracted usually on the basis of legally-drawn mortgages and were not repayable by annual or other instalments, but were withdrawable at three months&apos; notice.Other Sources. In many cases, vendors &quot;left&quot; a portion of the selling-price with the purchasers. Other sources from which farmers obtained money to complete their purchases were the Farmers&apos; Land Purchase Company and, particularly in Scotland, various insurance companies.28. (c.) Rates of Interest charged. Banks.-The rate of interest charged by Banks varied from 6 per cent, to 6  per cent. This has since been reduced to from 5 per cent, to 5^&apos;per cent. The usual charge for overdrafts appears to be I per cent, to 1 per cent, above bank rate, with a minimum of 5 per cent.Relatives and Friends. This was naturally the cheapest form of accommodation. In many sases farmers lent to each other at 4 per cent, to 4^ per cent.Solicitors lent Trustee-funds at 6 per cent, to 7 per cent, without redemption. In some cases these rates have been reduced by 1 per cent., but it has been represented that a reduction is difficult to bring about. These mortgage contracts often involved farmers in considerable expenses and procuration fees.Vendors appear to &apos;have lent money at a general rate of 5 per cent.The Farmers&apos; Land Purchase Company charged a net rate of 41 per cent, to 5 per cent., after deducting income tax (representing a gross figure of 6 per cent, to 61 per cent.) plus a half-yearly repayment of 2  per cent, of capital. Where endowment policies were insisted on by assignees, the rates charged to the farmer were proportionately higher.Insurance Companies charged the market rate of interest plus a fluctuating charge in respect of life insurance depending on the age of the borrower.29. (d.) Declineinthe Value of Agricultural Land. Since 1920, as a result of prevailing economic conditions, there has been a steady decline in the value of agricultural real estate. The greatest fall in value has been on land which is expensive to cultivate. Apart from Lincolnshire, however, where, owing to exceptional circum-stances, land has dropped more than 30 per cent., the depreciation even of strong arable land has not exceeded 25 per cent. The average drop in the value of land generally would appear to be not more than from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent.30. (e.) Present Attitude of Lenders. So far as we have been able to ascertain, the attitude of the various categories of lenders is, at present, as follows : Banks. It has been represented to us that the Banks are not bringing pressure to bear on new owner-occupiers to reduce overdrafts; that it would be inimical to their immediate interests to do so, and that it would be bad business in the long run to take any action which would break farmer after farmer throughout the length and breadth of the country. The conditions on which the Banks advanced money were essentially those for short-term loans. It was specified, in many cases, that advances were to be repaid in six to twelve months. This, however, was merely a customary precaution and, as yet, the Banks do not appear to have exercised to any considerable extent their right to call in their money. At the same time, it has to be borne in mind that the Banks are not in a position to lend money on long-term mortgages. Having regard to their obligations to their depositors, they are bound to keep their money within reasonably short call. They realise, however, that agriculture is in a bad way, and that its revival will be later than that of other industries. Moreover,, to call in their loans too drastically would probably involve the Banks in heavy losses.
Their present policy is, therefore, to. nurse farmers by reducing interest whenever possible and generally to keep them going, even though, in. some cases, the Banks are receiving no interest and no repayment of principal. They would, however, naturally prefer to see the outstanding loans paid off as soon as possible, and, if a farmer is doing well, they will probably suggest, after a time, that he should effect a permanent mortgage elsewhere for the amount of his loan outstanding. We are aware that it has been argued that the present quiescence of the Banks is due to the absence of demand for money in other directions and that when trade revives they will be anxious to recover their loans and will bring stronger pressure to bear on farmers to reduce their overdrafts. We are satisfied, however, that, taking everything into consideration, the Banks are handling the situation with patience and forbearance and are showing reasonable consideration within the recognised principles of sound banking.Solicitors (in respect of Trustee-funds). Occasional calling-in is a characteristic of loans from Trustee-funds owing to adjustments of the Trust due to deaths, marriages, &amp;c. At present such loans are not being called-in to any abnormal extent, and there is no general tendency on the part of mortgagees to foreclose. If the present depression continues, mortgagees may, however, foreclose in order to avoid further loss and so involve the farmers concerned in heavy renewal or replacement charges.Other Lenders. Mortgages contracted through Insurance Companies and through the Farmers&apos; Land Purchase Company are not ordinarily liable to be called-in and no difficulties arise with regard to these loans. Nor have landowners shown any marked anxiety to require repayment of sums advanced at the time of purchase. On the other hand, there is evidence that loans derived from wholly private sources are, in many cases, being called-in for reasons, no doubt, of personal necessity.Besume of Financial Position of New Otcner-Occupiers.31. From the foregoing, it is clear that in the great majority of cases the new owner-occupiers are in a state of great uncertainty as to the tenure of their loans. It is equally clear from evidence that we have received that owing to the existing depression, and to the heavy annual charges which they have now to meet in respect of interest on borrowed money, tithe, repairs, improve-meuts, &amp;e., they are finding the greatest difficulty in making both ends meet. A few farmers paid off their loans entirely soon after the purchase of their holdings, particularly those who bought in 1917 and 1918, when big profits were still being made. A considerable number of borrowers have paid off part of their loans, so that the amount outstanding in their case no longer represents any large proportion of the value of the properties concerned. Both these classes are in a fairly sound position. It is probable, however, that the great majority of the new owner-occupiers borrowed as much as two-thirds of the purchase price, and, as a result, have incurred annual charges which are far in excess of the economic rents of the holdings, and in many cases amount to as much as double the pre-war rentals. . This is particularly so in cases where high prices were paid. It &quot;would appear that those farmers who bought at exceptionally high prices and were unable to find more than a small proportion of the purchase price cannot be relieved from the consequences of their action. They made bad investments, in the first instance, and nothing short of a free grant from public funds can save them from disaster. Effect on Production.32. It is important to examine the general effect which the impecunious condition of the new owner-occupiers is exerting and will no doubt continue to exert on the agricultural output of the country. There is abundant evidence that the employment-giving and productive capacity of the new owner-occupiers have been fettered by lack of the capital which they have sunk in the purchase of their farms and by the uncertainty they feel as to the duration of their loans. Instead of being in a position to increase their circulating capital, i.e., capital required for wages, seeds, fertilisers, feeding-stuffs, &amp;c, these farmers, if they succeed, have to devote[9393]   &apos; &apos; o2
their profits largely to reduction of their overdrafts or to the repayment, in large instalments, of the capital borrowed from other sources. This obviously involves running their farms on less productive methods than normally, and though this is defensible, as a sound, and indeed almost inevitable, treatment of the individual business problem, it has reactions on national welfare which are clearly detrimental.The Case for Helping the Netv Owner-Occupiers.33. Briefly, the arguments in favour of State intervention are : (a.) The obligations of the State towards farmers who bought in good faith relying on the permanence of the Government promises.(6.) The adverse effect on production and employment now and in the future of allowing these men to remain in their, present position of difficulty and uncertainty.34. We are satisfied that existing machinery does not adequately meet the situation. Bank overdrafts and loans from private sources are of an essentially temporary character, mortgages from Trust funds are capricious and the Farmers&apos; Land Purchase Company is finding difficulty, we are informed, in raising sufficient capital to extend its activities. We have therefore addressed ourselves to the problem of devising means by which the more deserving cases can be assisted out of their present difficulties.Facilities in other Countries.35. In this connection we have been impressed by the extent to which nearly all progressive countries in both hemispheres have created special and permanent machinery under the auspices of the State to facilitate the provision of long-term mortgage-credit for agriculturists. We find that in Germany, for instance, long-term credit is available either through the Landscbaften, which are co-operative associations of landowners operating under State supervision and dating back to the middle of the eighteenth century, or through the agency of provincial and State-endowed Mortgage-Credit Banks or through the ordinary Joint-Stock and Savings Banks. Similar arrangements have been made, to a greater or less extent, in other European countries&apos;, and ample provision also appears to exist in the United States and Canada. Many of the agencies employed are  of a non-profit-seekingi character. They grant loans up to two-thirds of the property valuation on first mortgage at moderate and fixed rates of interest, the loans being repayable by small annual instalments over a fixed period, though mortgagors have the privilege of paying off the whole or part of the loan at any time on short notice.36. It is curious that no corresponding facilities exist in this country. The problem, in its general aspects, is no new one. A Committee under the Chairmanship of the late Lord Haversham enquired in 1911 into the position of tenant farmers on the occasion of any change in the ownership of their holdings. This Committee recommended the establishment of a State-assisted Land Bank or Institution to lend money to the farmer to enable him to purchase his holding. We are unable to go as far as that Committee in recommending State assistance for land purchase generally. Not only are the relative advantages of ownership and tenancy still a highly controversial subject, but it would appear that the effect of lending money on easy terms may lead to the tenant paying a higher price than he would otherwise do. We consider that in the present financial circumstances State assistance should be confined to those who contracted to purchase their holdings between the dates of the passing of the Corn Production Act, 1917, and the passing of the Com Production Acts (Repeal) Act of 1921, that is to say, those who may be said to have purchased their farms relying on the continuance of State guarantees.Proposal.37. To meet the case of these oceupying-owners we make the following concrete proposal: That Statutory Authority should be obtained under which approved Mortgage Societies or Institutions should be granted a
measure of State assistance by way of loans and guarantees under regulations to be made by the Treasury.We suggest that these regulations should contain, inter alia, the following specific provisions : (a.) The State to guarantee the interest and capital for the lifetime of special issues of Debentures made by such approved Societies, the proceeds of such issues being used by the Societies as a fund for loans on approved mortgages on agricultural holdings purchased by farmers between the date of the passing of the Com Production Act, 1917, and the passing of the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act, 1921.(b.) The Debentures to be redeemed by drawings within a period not exceeding forty years out of the proceeds of repay-ments of the loans by the mortgagors, the liability of the State in respect to such Debentures thus ceasing automatically.(c.) The loans to mortgagors to be made by the Society at a. rate of interest not more than ^ per cent, above the rate of interest at which it is able to borrow, and to be repaid by the mortgagors within the period of the lifetime of the Debentures.(d.) Loans to mortgagors not to exceed 75 per cent, of the present value of the security, and to be repayable by equal half-yearly instalments calculated on an annuity basis on the \\ per cent, tables within such periods as may be agreed, but not exceeding the lifetime of the Debentures.(e.) The expenses of the Society in connection with the granting of the loans to be added to the amount borrowed and to be fixed by scales approved by the Treasury on the advice of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.(/.) The \ per cent, margin between the interest paid by the mortgagors and the cost of the money to the Society to be divided into equal moieties. One-quarter per cent, to be paid to the State and set aside to constitute a reserve fund against any possible call upon the State guarantee. The remaining \ per cent, to be retained by the Society to cover expenses and management.(g.) The reserve fund to be retained by the State until the whole of the Debentures have been redeemed, and any balance of the fund, after deductions to meet deficits of interest on the Debentures, to be paid to the Society.(h.) The constitution and capitalisation of the Society to be approved by the Treasury, and the interest payable on any private share or loan capital of the Society not to exceed such rate as may from time to time be fixed by the Treasury.The detailed regulations would have to be worked put by. negotiation, but we are of opinion that the above provisions form a fair and workable basis.38. An approved Society should be able to place a guaranteed issue of Debentures on terms which, after covering the expenses of the issue, would give them the necessary capital at an interest not exceeding 5 per cent. The mortgagor would thus have to pay 5J per cent, plus amortisation. If a period of forty years is allowed for the repayment of the loan the total annual charge to the borrower would be  6 8s. M. per cent, per annum.89. We recommend that at the outset the capital should be issued to the Society or Societies by the Public Works Loan Board, and that the issue of State-guaranteed Debentures should be made when a sufficiently large sum has been lent to any individual Society from this source. We regard it as essential to the successful issue of any guaranted stock that it should be of sufficient dimensions to be handled economically and to enable a market in the stock to be created. Not only is the expense of handling a small issue relatively much heavier than a large issue, but the status of the stock on the market will depend to a Large extent on its bulk.40. We are satisfied that the method by which the State first lends the money and subsequently replaces the loan by a State-
guaranteed issue of Debentures is preferable to a State loan for the whole period. It will accustom the market to this type of security and encourage the Society or Societies to make further issues at a later date without the guarantee of the State should they desire to extend their operations beyond.the restricted group of purchasers to whom we have referred.41. We are confident that an arrangement such as that outlined above will be of real and lasting benefit to the great majority of the new owner-occupiers. We are under no delusion as to the extent of the limitation imposed by our recommendation that the capital sum advanced in each case shall not exceed 75 per cent, of the present value of the holdings. We fully realise that this proposal will not help those farmers who made grossly injudicious purchases and borrowed the greater portion of the money for the purpose. On the other hand, the proposal will help materially those who found, or have since paid off, a reasonable proportion of the purchase money, and it will relieve them of their present grave anxiety as to the duration of their outstanding loans. It will also enable many farmers who have fixed irreducible mortgages to take up loans of a reducible character. We believe that farmers, generally, will welcome the opportunity which the scheme affords of paying off a small portion of the loan each year, instead of discharging their liabilities by the payment of lump sums as and when required. They will feel that under the scheme their indebtedness is a diminishing factor, and they will be encouraged to make good in the knowledge that their position is improving year by year. We suggest that borrowers should bo enabled, if they so desire, to pay off the whole of the balance of the outstanding loans whenever they find themselves in a position to do so.42. We are aware that in most cases a rate of interest and sinking fund of  6 8s. 3d. per cent, per annum will, be in excess of the cost of the temporary accommodation which these farmers have obtained. We see no reason to suppose, however, that those whom the scheme is designed to benefit will find the added cost a burden of undue magnitude, or that they will not readily assume the increased annual charges having regard to the substantial and permanent nature of the advantages conferred.43. As an example of the way in which the scheme will operate, we cannot do better than quote the following concrete case which has been brought to our notice. A farm, the value of which may be taken asvt&apos;12,000, was recently purchased by the tenant, who raised  9,500 on mortgage for the purpose. The mortgage debt has been reduced from time to time, and the principal sum now owing is  7,470. This is repayable by half-yearly payments of  237 10s., making  475 per annum in all. In addition the interest.charge for the current year will amount to approximately  440. The total outgoings for the current year in respect of the loan amount, there-fore, to  915. Owing to the fall in prices, and to the fact that the farmer concerned is being pressed to reduce his Bank overdraft, he is finding difficulty in making both ends meet. Under the scheme we have proposed he will be enabled to contract a fresh loan for  9,000 on which his total annual payments on a forty-year basis will amount to  576 as against  915 at present. He will also be able to liquidate his present loan of  7,470, and, in addition, fully satisfy the Bank by substantially reducing his overdraft.44. We are of opinion that loans not exceeding 75 per cent, of present value will be found to be well secured as to capital. The remarkable stability of the value of agricultural land, both at times of high farming profits and in the face of agricultural depression, is due to the fact that the market value of land at any given date reflects opinion as to the whole future revenues or profits which tho occupation of the land may afford. Capital values are based on the long view and are not greatly affected by ephemeral conditions. We are also of opinion that the world-wide phenomenon which we have recently experienced of the prices of agricultural produce falling below the cost of production cannot continue and that the position is bound to adjust itself in such a way that profits will be made in agriculture in the future as in the past.45. We do not consider, therefore, that the liability of the State under the scheme will prove to be serious. We have endeavoured to frame our proposals on sound business lines and we are not
without hope that the success of the scheme in dealing with the war purchases will stimulate the establishment of machinery of wider scope to afford facilities to tenant farmers who may desire or find it necessary to purchase their holdings in future years. We see no reason why, after a little experience of the present scheme, the approved Society or Societies should not be able to raise capital on reasonable terms in the open market, without a State guarantee, to enable them to undertake, concurrently with this scheme, the business of financing land purchase in other cases.46. Finally, we desire to draw attention to the fact that the Farmers&apos; Land Purchase Company, incorporated under an Act of 1920 (10 and 11 Geo. V, c. 50), is already doing business somewhat on the lines of that which we have suggested. Advances are made upon approved security up to 75 per cent, of the purchase money at a fixed rate of interest, repayable by half-yearly instalments of capital spread over a period of twenty years. The Company has contracted loans so far to the extent of approximately  500,000, but it has had to refuse applications amounting to  5,000,000 to  6,000,000 owing to lack of resources. The Company is not a Public Utility Company, but we understand that it would be prepared to subject itself to a proviso that its Dividend should be limited to a figure approved by the Treasury, providing it received some measure of State assistance and recognition. It will be observed that our scheme makes it possible for this Company to obtain such assistance, though its terms do not preclude the recognition of other similar Companies.V. ShoH-Term Credit for Farmers to Meet their Current Needs.47. This division of our subject represents the main problem of agricultural credit and is of the greatest importance to the agricultural community as a whole.48. Credit for a comparatively short period is often of assistance to farmers for the purchase of seeds, fertilisers, feeding-stuffs, seasonal stock and equipment, and for the purpose of enabling them to arrange the systematic marketing of their produce. In the nature of things, loans are also needed by farmers in the course of their operations for purposes which are not strictly seasonal, in the sense that the period necessary to secure for the farmer a turnover on the outlay involved may extend from one to five years. The main purposes for which accommodation of this nature is required are for the initial purchase by breeders and dairy farmers of foundation stock, the purchase of machinery and implements, and the execution by tenant farmers of minor improvements such as additional fencing or drainage, or the erection of silos and Dutch barns. Improvements of this nature have frequently to be under-taken by tenants owing, in many cases, to the reluctance of landowners to impose further charges on their estates.49. We have carefully considered the facilities at present available for farmers for these purposes, the attitude of the lenders and the general adequacy of these facilities, having regard to present and potential requirements.Existing Facilities.50. The main sources whence farmers derive short-term credit at the present time are (i) Banks, by means of loans, or overdrafts on accounts, and (ii) auctioneers, seedsmen, manure-merchants, traders, dealers and private money-lenders.51. (i.) Banks. The Banks are obviously interested in the development and maintenance of the trade of the country. They are out to increase their business and their profits, and. within the limitations of ordinary business risks, it is only logical to assume that they are making every effort to meet the short-term credit requirements of the agricultural industry. There is, however, considerable conflict of opinion as to whether they treat agriculture as sympathetically as they do the urban interests. The main indictment against the Banks appears to rest on their alleged indifference to the interests and needs, of agriculture. It is held that since the disappearance of the old country Banks and their absorption by the big Joint Stock establishments, whose policies are directed from London on more or less rigid lines, there is a growing
1(5tendency for the Banks to handle agricultural loans on a hard-and-fast commercial basis which is inapplicable to rural conditions and to impose unfavourable terms. It is asserted that the local managers, who have been substituted for the old type of country banker, have less discretion with regard to loans, being unable to make advances beyond small limits without reference to London, and that they are moved about from branch to branch and often do not acquire that intimate local and personal knowledge which is so essential to a proper appreciation of the credit status of their farmer customers. A further complaint against the present banking system is that the deposits received from rural areas are not returned to fructify in the countryside, but are diverted to urban areas and monopolised by the Banks for commercial and speculative purposes at home and abroad.52. It is important to realise that these charges of unsympathetic policy, unfamiliar managers and discrimination in favour of commercial investments are not of recent origin, but have been preferred, in a general way, against the Joint Stock banking system. They are not, therefore, special features of the crisis through which agriculture is now passing.53. On behalf of the Banks, it has been pointed out that relatively more agricultural loans are, in fact, outstanding to-day than in the days of the small private Banks.   The fact that all applications for overdrafts are referred to the Head Office for approval no doubt accounts for some of the criticism to which the Banks have been subjected, though, in actual practice, the older and more experienced managers are allowed considerable latitude. Moreover, where applications are refused, it is possible that the local managers seek refuge from the unpopularity of adverse decisions by throwing the onus on to the Head Office.   The Banks have always regarded the farmer as a good customer and they are anxious to maintain and,  where possible,  to develop their agricultural connection, there being very keen competition between them for that purpose.   They claim to appreciate fully the farmer&apos;s difficulties at the present time, and their policy is to be as helpful as possible, consistent with then- responsibility to their depositors. With the great majority of farmers an overdraft is a routine arrangement for a part of the year.    The farmer who is enter-prising, keeps books and knows bis way about the world, has little difficulty in obtaining credit, and even the less enterprising type of farmer is more afraid of the Bank than the Bank is shy of him. In some e;ases of complaint, it transpires that the farmer is carrying on some other business, doing badly at it, and trying to play off one Bank against another.   To any ordinary farmer, of whom the Banks have personal knowledge, they would, if necessary, give credit on his crops alone, although they can take no legal charge. In the fruit-growing districts of Evesham and Pershore, for instance, growers obtain credit from the Banks on what the manager can see for himself on the trees.   The Banks realise that the liquidation of agricultural loans is a longer process, as a rule, than the repayment of purely commercial advances, but there is a constant ebb and flow of money from and into the farmer&apos;s account which means good business, although the loan account may not be cleared rapidly.   In the country districts, an overdraft, unspecified as regards purpose, is more common than definite loans for particular requirements.   The overdraft is reduced or extended according to the daily or weekly alternations of receipts and expenditure of the farmer concerned.    It is an essentially elastic arrangement, affording both secrecy and simplicity, and one pre-eminently suited to rural conditions.   Moreover, it is the cheapest way of obtaining money; the normal rate of interest is 1 per cent, above Bank rate, though it is understood that a minimum of 5 per cent, is almost invariably fixed; interest is only charged on the net amount outstanding from day to day and there are no legal or procuration charges such as are usually associated with the advance of money from other sources.   If the account is remunerative, no charge for keeping it is made.   If it bears an overdraft, the charge, apart from interest, is only the bare cost of keeping it.   The complaints that incidental Bank. charges are excessive are generally without foundation.    With regard to managers, there is admittedly a tendency for more changes to be made in the managerships of the
country branches than in the days before amalgamation, as these appointments are now open to a wider field. A large number of the old managers are, however, still in office. As far as promotion difficulties will permit, the Banks endeavour to retain the staff in the districts to which they belong, and even in those cases where a townsman is appointed to a county branch, he is first attached in a supernumerary capacity to study the local characteristics of the business before he is allowed to take over. Admittedly, the old country banker has disappeared, but some of the Banks have local directors who live in the district and know a good deal about the farmers&apos; business. Finally, from the point of view of the agricultural community, it is important to realise that, notwith-standing the absorption of the small country Banks, there is, in fact, far keener competition for rural business than ever before; while, in the matter of security to depositors, the amalgamation of the Banks has also been of very great advantage. The old private Banks were always&apos; heavily -involved in the fortunes of a restricted area and this was a source of weakness at times of local crisis. The Joint Stock Banks spread their risks over a wider area and a greater range of industries, and can better carry periods of depression.54. As regards Scotland, there is a similar vague feeling that the existing Scottish Joint Stock Banks, so far as they have entered the English amalgamations, are more or less unsympathetically controlled from London and that credit is suffering as a result-Taking everything into consideration, however, few complaints have reached the Committee with regard to the attitude of the-Scottish Banks. This may, perhaps, be explained by the fact that&apos; within Scotland there has been no concentration of banking such as has happened in England, and the national Banks, which are well diffused through the country, have remained as separate entities. As a result, they are well acquainted with their clients. The local agents are, moreover, more or less stationary, which makes for stability in management. Short-term credit for agriculture is habitual in Scotland, and legal security is seldom asked for provided a man is known. In addition to this accommodation, the Banks in Scotland almost universally advance credit for working capital for a term of years on the guarantee of joint sureties. Indeed, in their earlier years, the Banks built up their business on this basis. The smaller agriculturists have thus been enabled to obtain credit more easily than in England. In the aggregate, the Banks have very large sums invested in this way. The sureties are conjointly and severally liable and are bound to-the extent of the principal plus three years&apos; interest. The rate of interest generally charged appears to be 5 per cent.55. Suggestions have been made to the effect that the Banks should be invited to attach agricultural experts to the country branches in order to remove any impediment to an extension of credit business among farmers which may be due to lack of agricultural knowledge and supervisory machinery on the part of the Banks. The appointment of agricultural experts of sufficient standing to be of real value would raise numerous difficulties and we do not regard the suggestion as practicable. In our view, the-system of local directors is the best line of development and one which could, with advantage, be adopted by all the Banks and more-widely extended.56. (ii.) Credit from Auctioneers, Merchants, Dealers, Trades-men, &amp;c. The great majority of farmers obtain credit from, auctioneers, or from the vendors of materials such as seeds, fertilisers and feeding-stuffs, required for ordinary farming opera-tions, or from live-stock dealers, tradesmen and, in some cases, professional money-lenders. It is common for credit from these sources to be concurrent with credit from the Banks. These practices have grown up automatically and instinctively with the development of the industry itself and may be regarded as the natural result of the persistent under-capitalisation of farming. So much, however, has been said as to the positively harmful nature of these sources of accommodation that it is desirable to examine in some detail their function and purpose.57. (a.) Credit from Auctioneers. The practice of obtaining credit from auctioneers is resorted to in some countries much more[9393] D
ISthan in others. Auctioneers of live-stock allow farmers to buy cattle -and sheep on credit and on the condition that these cattle and sheep, or lambs born from the latter, are resold in their markets. Apart from any question of prices, the auctioneer appears to obtain a slightly higher rate of interest than the current bank rate, in addition&apos; to commission on resales, while the farmers are handi--capped by being tied to their market and, in some cases, being bound rather by the auctioneers&apos; interest than their own as to time .of sale. The arrangement, however, is neither unnatural nor generally unbeneficial. It has been represented that auctioneers, as a whole, certainly do not treat farmers badly. Moreover, there are incidental advantages, notably that the auctioneer is usually a man of accumulated knowledge and sound practical judgment whose experience is always at the disposal of the small farmer to help him buy wisely and well.58. (b.) Credit from Merchants. Credit from merchants is almost universal, extending to corn .and hay merchants, cake merchants and, to a less extent, to the purchase of fertilisers. A farmer buys seeds of all kinds on credit from a corn merchant, who may make the condition that the corn crops are sold to him when harvested. Very long credit is sometimes given in this way. We have been informed that in some districts seedsmen supply grass seeds in the spring of one year and have to wait until the summer -of the following year when the crop is secured before their bill is settled. There is no doubt that at present all traders have very long lists of debts against farmers. It has been represented to us, on behalf of corn merchants, that, taking the trade generally, they practically never receive any return by way of interest on overdue accounts, and the method of granting discount for cash is not adopted to any appreciable extent. Merchants, generally, show no sign of forcing matters at the present time and it is certainly not in their interest to do so.59. (c.) Credit from Dealers. In certain districts dealers have a monopoly of supplying cattle to farmers on a credit basis. They pay periodical visits to grazing districts and buy largely for some farmers on commission, while others they supply with a &quot; yardful of bullocks&quot; on credit. On the sale of these latter bullocks it is frequently the custom to divide the profit in equal moieties between the two parties. Dealers, as a rule, are keen business men. They dispose of the best cattle to those farmers who can pay cash; the inferior go to the financially involved. This does not mean that the dealer serves no useful part in rural economy. It is far cheaper for a farmer to buy his stock through him than to travel long distances to markets for the purpose.60. (d.) Advances on Crops. This particular system of credit operates largely in districts where fruit and market-garden produce is grown. Merchants will buy a grower&apos;s crop early in the summer, make him an advance and take the risk of the yield and the price realised. In Lincolnshire and Kent it is not uncommon for a merchant to pay a farmer to grow a crop, usually potatoes. The farmer&apos;s price includes a profit on the cultivations, and the merchant takes all risks. In some parts of Essex this practice is extended to seed growers. These systems are by no means disadvantageous to the farmer. The middlemen concerned in the transactions indulge in a speculation and may make big profits or big losses. This applies particularly to the fruit trade. So far as horticultural produce is concerned, there is general agreement that selling crops on the ground in this way, or growing them at a guaranteed price, is preferable to selling them through a commission agent when harvested. We see no reason for interference with these customs. &quot;The farmer is insured and guaranteed an average profit. The merchant, by means of his dealings in different localities and &quot;districts, is able to spread his risk over an extensive area.Adequacy of Existing Facilities.61, It is desirable to consider to what extent these various facilities meet the present credit requirements of farmers. Taking first the question of the Banks, we have been at some pains to ascertain from each of the five leading Banks in England and Wales the precise extent of the loans to agriculturists outstanding at the present time. Aggregating the information which we have received
we find that no less a sum than 46^ millions sterling is at present out on loan to farmers from these sources, of which 26 millions-represents loans for the purchase of agricultural land and 20 millions normal loans for current trading. We confess to some surprise at the magnitude of these figures, which, in. our judgment, furnish the most convincing evidence against the general criticisms we have referred to above. This is not to say, however, that the Banks cover-the whole of the credit needs of farmers in so far as they are not met by merchants and others, and we will proceed to indicate the directions in which, in our judgment, further facilities are required.62.; (a.) Farmers without Effective Access to Banking Facilities. Credit from the Banks is, of course, restricted to men having banking accounts. Admittedly, there are not many farmers without them in Great Britain to-day, but such as they are they reveal a gap in the credit system. A far larger class is that of small farmers in the thinly populated areas who, although they have banking accounts, live so far away from their Banks, or, for other-reasons, are so much outside the ambit of the managers, acquaintance that they are unable to pledge their personal integrity. We fully realise that the Banks are in a unique position to assess-the personal factor because of the knowledge they possess of the past and present fluctuations of individual accounts, but the transactions, of farmers&apos; accounts, are not an infallible criterion of their credit status. Farming is essentially an undertaking which cannot be easily appraised without considerable technical knowledge, and, in these cases, the Banks have very little else to go on beyond the general make-up of the farmer as a business man. Some farmers, are, of course, largely themselves responsible for this, as they make little or no effort to present what security they do possess in the most attractive form by keeping books worthy of the name and supporting their case by a proper balance-sheet. Credit - from merchants, as apart from Banks, does not of itself adequately meet their need even in normal times, let alone times of severe-depression like tho present though there is evidence that merchants are at present helping them very extensively as in addition to the cost of materials, heavy charges have to be met in respect of labour, rent, rates, &amp;e. In periods of depression, credit in respect of these charges is necessary to supplement the customary year-in year-out accommodation which farmers derive from merchants, and it is precisely this supplementary credit that many farmers are finding it difficult to obtain in present circumstances.63. (b.) Credit for the Purchase of Live-stock, cic. A second direction in which the Banks, except perhaps the Scottish Banks, do not uniformly&apos;favour the advance of money is for the purpose of purchasing seasonal stock. This is mainly due to a feeling of&quot; nervousness that such stock is easily removable and difficult for the Bank to trace, and, therefore, does not constitute a satisfactory banking security, but the relative magnitude of the amounts, required is no doubt an important consideration. And yet seasonal stock fulfils the fundamental credit requirement of productiveness and may, indeed, yield, in certain circumstances, considerable-profit. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that farmers who have no collateral security to offer to their Bank tend to make use of such credit facilities as are offered by dealers and auctioneers, and, in times of depression, the amount of credit given in this way may increase very greatly, while, of course, the terms on which it is-given do not become easier as the risk increases. In the early nineties prominent dealers are said to have boasted that half the farmers in certain districts were farming for them, and this state of affairs may recur if the existing depression continues and no-alternative facilities are provided. In a similar way, the arrange--ments offered by merchants and other traders tend to become decreasingly favourable as the financial position of the farmer-weakens. It is, therefore, a matter for serious consideration whether some alternative machinery cannot be provided, to which farmers may resort, if they so desire, and thus avoid the economic servitude which some forms of mercantile credit undoubtedly entail.64. (c.) Credit for Additional&apos; Equipment.- Finally, there is-evidence to show that the&apos; Banks do not satisfactorily meet the case-of the farmer requiring a loan for a few years to enable him to[9393] D 2
improve the equipment of his farm. This is not surprising, for the investment of money in non-convertible securities in this way is hardly consonant with the canons of banking. This accommodation may be required for such purposes as the purchase of permanent breeding-stock, the provision of implements, machinery and equip-ment, and the execution, by tenants, of minor improvements, such as fencing, drainage, &amp;c. The evidence we have received from Scotland is emphatic as to the desirability of loan capital being made available for farmers for these purposes. In this connection it is interesting to note that under existing Treasury regulations, pursuant to Section 18 of the Land Settlement Facilities Act, 1919, advances to statutory ex-Service small-holders may be made for a period of three years, subject to extension to five years in exceptional cases, for the purchase of live-stock, fruit trees and implements. It may be observed here that it was precisely this type of credit inter-mediate credit we may call it which was the main accommodation provided by the original Eaiffeisen Societies in Germany and with .such extraordinarily successful results.65. To sum up, we have come to the conclusion that the existing arrangements do not fully meet the needs of the small farmer who has no effective access to banking facilities, that machinery should be devised, or existing machinery extended, to enable farmers who so desire to purchase their seasonal stock and raw materials on credit at least commensurate with that at present given by dealers and merchants, but under agricultural rather than purely mercantile auspices, and that some arrangements are necessary to enable, farmers to obtain a measure of intermediate credit, over a term of years.Short-Term and Intermediate Credit in Other Countries.66. We have devoted some attention to the machinery existing in other countries for the provision of short-term and intermediate credit for farmers. In most European countries the conditions of farm life are especially adapted to local organisation along the lines of the co-operative purchase of supplies, sale of produce, insurance and credit. The small size of the individual farming unit often renders the need of organisation essential in order that the individual farmer may save himself from exploitation. Policies on this basis have been framed by the majority of European Governments, and in India, Japan, the United States and Canada progress along these lines has also been considerable. For various reasons into which we need not now enter, we do not consider that the systems now in existence in other countries will apply without substantial modification to conditions in this country at the present time.Proposals.67. We have very carefully considered the scheme which was recommended by the Credit-Sub-Committee of the Agricultural Advisory Committee in February 1922, under which it was proposed that loans should be granted to farmers on the advice of the County Agricultural Committees working through the Banks who were to be guaranteed against loss by the Government. A restricted scheme of this kind would, of course, tend to relieve existing credit organisations of some of their outstanding loans without conferring any appreciable benefit on the farmers, while we doubt whether, in the present condition of the national finances, the State could afford to face the losses which would be incurred if a large sum of money were advanced in this way, due regard being had to the general contraction of existing facilities which would undoubtedly occur on the entry of the State into the field. Moreover, the scheme is not a constructive proposal. It was devised as a purely temporary expedient and does not build up for the future any definite and permanent system of credit.68. Again, it has been suggested to us that it would be a natural and useful arrangement for the State to arrange for credit to be conveyed to agriculturists through the channel of the purchase of their ordinary requirements. A scheme of this character, applied to agricultural merchants and dealers as a whole, would be administratively impracticable, even if it were desirable generally. An attractive modification would limit the application to agricultural co-operative Trading Societies.   Indeed, it has been urged that an
-arrangement of this character should be introduced with the definite intention of stimulating the development of these Societies. Such .a proposal would certainly be received with considerable hostility in ordinary trading circles, and would, of course, only help those who traded through those organisations. It would also narrow down the purposes for which credit is given, whereas we are satisfied that where credit is needed in existing circumstances meticulous discrimination as to the purpose for which it is given is not only of secondary importance, but is quite impracticable.69. The essential difficulty in devising any sound scheme for affording additional credit facilities for agriculture lies in the fact chat unless means can be devised which will enhance the intrinsic credit status of borrowers, the risks involved may be serious. The most effective way of increasing a farmer&apos;s credit status is by inducing him to link up his credit with that of his fellows. This is the principle of co-operative credit which has been successfully applied to the case of farmers in other countries and we are convinced that it is in this direction that a solution of the short-term credit problems of agriculture in this country should be sought.70. Beyond the system of Bank loans on the guarantees of sureties jointly and severally liable which has done so much to assist agriculture in Scotland, nothing has yet been done on a large scale to mobilise credit in Great Britain in this way, though there has been a certain amount of propaganda in the past. Although conditions are now probably more favourable for an innovation of this kind than ever before, we are satisfied first that -any attempt to form Credit Societies without the stimulus of State assistance would be futile and, secondly, that it will not be possible to establish co-operative Credit Societies to the desired extent on the Baiffeisen principle of unlimited liability which has been the foundation of most of the previous proposals. The weight of evidence is, in this respect, overwhelming, and it is supported by the comparative inactivity of the few Societies on the Baiffeison model which already exist in this country. We see no reason, however, why, with State assistance, approved Societies should not spring up and develop rapidly on the basis of a strictly limited liability, a considerable portion of their capital remaining uncalled except in the event of liquidation.71. With a view to enlisting the fullest local support, we consider that the scheme we submit below should provide for utilising the local savings of the villages concerned as a fund from which to make loans for productive agricultural purposes instead of allowing them, as at present, to be diverted to the industrial areas. An arrangement of this kind has been dovetailed succesfully into many credit systems abroad. We develop this suggestion in the ensuing pages, hut we mention it, at this stage, in order to indicate our view as to the source whence the financial assistance should, if possible, be derived.72. The proposal to encourage, by State assistance, the formation of co-operative Credit , Societies possesses the further advantage that it will afford means, indeed, the only means, by which agricultural labour will directly benefit by any measure of State credit for the farming industry. The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament contained the statement with regard to the existing depression, that it is hoped that &quot; means may be found to alleviate some of the difficulties confronting both farmers and labourers.&quot; The labourers will be able to take full advantage of the local Credit Societies for the purchase of live-stock, &amp;c, on a reasonably long-term basis. It is obvious that with wages down to 30s. a week, or even less, few married labourers with families are able to buy live-stock without a very large measure of &quot;improvement&quot; credit at the present time. In this connection, we have been informed of instances where members of the few Credit Societies already existing have risen, by means of a succession of loans, from the position of labourers to that of substantial small-holders.73. Our concrete proposals are as follows : (1.1 Agriculturists should be urged on grounds of self-interest to form themselves into co-operative Credit Societies, the constitution of which should be in accordance with rules laid down by the
Treasury in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and&apos; Fisheries and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.(2.) Although the Societies would be intended primarily for those engaged in agriculture, membership should be open to any person sufficiently interested in promoting the prosperity of the countryside to be willing to lend his capital and his credit for that purpose. We attach special importance to securing at the outset the hearty co-operation of persons of standing in each district. In this way, not only will the formation of Societies be facilitated,, but they will commence operations straightaway with a solid financial backing and a correspondingly greater capacity for useful service.(3.) The rules framed before the War by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries may to some extent be adopted as a basis for defining the constitution and functions of the proposed new Societies, but they will have to be considerably modified and amplified to meet the necessities of the case. In the time at our disposal we have been unable to consider in any great detail the precise status and form of the Societies, but if the general principles we propose are accepted we shall be pleased to go more fully into the matter with a view to securing the establishment of Societies on a basis which will give them individuality and prestige and provide them with such powers as will enable them to be of real service to the community.(4.) Special branches should be formed in the Departments of Agriculture to encourage the formation of the local Credit Societies. The Societies should be affiliated through these Central Depart-ments, or standing Committees appointed for the purpose, and the-Departments should superintend their operations. The system by which the War Savings Associations were first formed and after-wards kept in view by the National Savings Committee might well be followed. The Departments would not be directly responsible for the operations of the Credit Societies, but should be in a position to cancel their affiliation and cut off State assistance when advisable. In our opinion, the success or otherwise of the whole scheme will depend entirely on the vigour and activity of the Central Depart-ments. Propaganda will probably prove to be even more important than finaneiahassistance.(5J The geographical unit for the formation of such Societies should be normally the Rural District, though in some cases, especially in Scotland, the civil parish will be preferable.(60 A capital sum should be advanced to such Societies by the Government on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, or the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, on the basis . of  1 for every  1 of share capital raised by the Society itself and upon which not less than 5s. in the   have been paid up, and which should rank for all purposes prior to the subscribed capital.(7.) The rate of interest payable by the Societies on the capital advanced by the State should be at the lowest economic rate possible.(8.) In the event of liquidation the State should have first charge on the Societies&apos; assets, including the uncalled capital.(9.) We do not see any objection to the Societies being entitled to receive deposits from members or non-members in order to increase their resources, but such deposits would not rank for State foans. The Societies should not, however, be entitled to raise other-loans without the previous approval of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries or the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.74. Reverting to the question as to the source&apos;from which the financial assistance should be derived, it may be argued that it does not matter from what State fund the money is provided so long as it is appropriate from the point of view of the Executive. We do not assent to this view. We are of opinion that, from the psychological standpoint, it is- important that the borrower should be made intimately aware that he is employing other peopled money, and that although the State is the agent whence the money is derived, it is merely the agent and that it has responsibilities to the lender from whom the money has been borrowed. It has also long been a criticism by country people that the Post Office Savings Bank and other systems of State-organised thrift, in so far as they are effective in the country districts, have the effect of
-collecting the small savings of individuals living in rural districts and transferring such capital to the towns or cities to be used for national purposes. The Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee drew attention to this absorption of rural capital in its report presented in 1917. This criticism has been met to some extent by the system introduced in October 1920, by which Local Authorities were empowered to borrow for local purposes from the Public Works Loan Board sums equal to one-half of the proceeds of Savings Certificates purchased in their respective districts. This system of borrowing Certificate monies for local needs has not had much effect in the rural districts mainly for the reason that Local Authorities with a rateable value below  200,000 had already the right to borrow from the Local Loans Fund.. We think that it is worth consideration whether State loans for agricultural credit on the lines suggested should not be drawn from the funds produced by the sales of Certificates in the rural areas. It is not possible to assess the amount of money actually invested by the rural population, as some of it is invested in the neighbouring towns. Moreover, the distinction between an urban and a rural district is often somewhat arbitrary. Of 650 technically rural districts only 337 have taken steps to inform the Savings Committee of the sales of Certificates in their respective areas, but it is possible from the figures which have been obtained to estimate that the proceeds of Savings Certificates in the rural areas is somewhere in the neighbourhood of from  5,000,000 to  6,000,000 per annum. A comparatively small proportion of this fund returned to benefit the rural areas through agricultural credit would go far to assist in the building up of the Credit Societies and to link up to mutual advantage the rural creditor, who is the purchaser of Certificates, with the rural debtor, who is the member of the local agricultural Credit Society giving bdJh parties to the contract an added sense of their responsibilities. We suggest that this aspect of the question might be submitted to the Savings Certificate Enquiry Committee at present sitting under the Chairmanship of the Right Honourable Edwin.S. Montagu, with a request that it should consider the effect of the above suggestion on the Savings movement.75. Local Credit Societies, formed on the above lines, should, if adequately financed, be able to meet the needs for short-term credit which we have found to exist. We see no reason to fetter in any way the discretion of these Societies to give credit for any agricultural object which, in their judgment, represents a justifiable investment of the Societies&apos; funds, but we hope that their efforts will be specially directed to assisting such operations as are calculated to maintain or increase the food production of the country.76. To sum up, an analysis of the short-term credit facilities available for agriculturists has revealed the following deficiencies : (a.) Credit for agriculturists without effective access to bankingfacilities. (h.) Credit for live-stock, &amp;a.(c.) Intermediate credit for improvements, foundation stock, implements, &amp;c.It will be seen that under the preceding proposals all these deficiencies can be met in a way which, in our judgment, is in strict conformity with the economic principles upon which we have understood credit should be normally based.77. We feel that it is in the interests of the State to give substantial support to a system of credit based as proposed on mutual association and collective effort, having the confidence that such assistance will develop powerful self-supporting natural machinery which will prove of permanent benefit to British agriculture.78. If our recommendations are deemed by some to be insufficient to meet at once and fully the exigencies of the moment, we refer to the inherent psychology of credit as their justification. Credit follows confidence, and the creation of confidence must be a condition precedent to the establishment of any sound credit system. To devise machinery for providing credit on any other basis is to court disaster. The main constructive proposals of the Committee will necessarily take time to fructify but as the proposed Credit
January 20, 1928.Societies increase in number and in strength a powerful and useful&apos; system of credit will be established which will prove of greater value to the community in the long run than could possibly result from any attempt to bolster up an unsound position by the general extension of credit on any other basis.;79. In conclusion, we desire to place on record our indebtedness to our Secretary, Mr. A. W. Street. His industry and ability in marshalling the evidence and in drafting our report have been invaluable, and throughout our inquiry he has been of the greatest possible assistance.YI. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. 80. Long-Term Credit.(a.) For Improvements: We recommend that the Improvement of Land Acts should be amended to authorise any association operating thereunder to charge such rate of interest as the Departments concerned may approve. We further recommend that the Lands Improvement Company should be urged to consider the advisability of wider publicity.(b.) For Purchase: We recommend that those farmers who purchased their holdings between the date of the passing of the Corn Production Act, 1917, and the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act, 1921, should be enabled to obtain loans by an approved Society operating under the aegis of the State, such loans not to exceed 75 per cent, of the present value of the holding concerned and to be repayable within a period of 40 years on an annuity basis. Funds for this purpose to be advanced in the first instance by the Public Works Loans Board and, subsequently, by the issue of guaranteed stock.Short-Term and Intermediate Credit.We recommend that the State should encourage the immediate formation of agricultural co-operative Credit Societies, and should place a capital sum at the disposal of each Society on the basis of  1 for every  1 of share capital raised by the Society, of which not less than 5s. in the   shall be paid up. These Societies to be affiliated through the Ministry of Agriculture or the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, to be allowed to receive deposits and to be given a free discretion as to the granting of loans to members for agricultural purposes. We further suggest that the State funds employed for the purpose of the scheme should be derived by the application of a portion of the money derived from the sale of Savings Certificates in rural areas.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants, (Signed)     THEODORE G.

Committee on Agricultural Credit,Reservation by Mr. H. M Conacher. of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.[9393]
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL CREDIT.RESERVATION.To Lieut.-Colonel the Right Hon.Sir Robert A. Sanders, Bt., T.D., M.P.Sir,1. I have signed the Report, because I agree in its recommen-dations, but in my view it does not go far enough. The reference directs the Committee to examine the means available for the provision of short-term credits for farmers to enable them to continue operations, and it appears reasonable to read the expression &quot;continue operations&quot; as referring to the particular difficulties of the present time for British farmers. The Committee have generally interpreted the reference as allowing them to consider how far it is necessary at all to make such provision and how far the existing machinery of credit adequately meets the situation, and they have reached the conclusion that the ordinary Banks under their existing practice on the whole meet the requirements of the farmer for what can strictly be called credit.2. I propose to develop the lines of my reservation by canvassing this conclusion, which seems to me to have been reached rather by regarding too exclusively the practice of the Banks as it works in normal times. The present times, however, are not normal, and one cannot overlook the fact that the Central Banks have been placed in a position of unusual responsibility in most of the more important belligerent countries since the war. The increasing-power of Banks in relation to the other elements of the economic fabric of society has been noted in Germany and the United States as well as in this country. This is only another way of emphasising the fact that industrial undertakings have been dependent to an abnormal extent since the war upon credit for carrying on their operations. For this purpose the national credit has been mobilised and conveyed to industry through the channel of the Banks.3. Industry has required credit to an unusual degree because long credit has often had to be given by producers to their customers, and to a certain extent because the expenses of production, and in particular wages of labour, have been abnormally high. Apart from extraordinary credit given through Banks, mention may be made of the statutory credit facilities afforded by the Overseas Trade Act and Trade Facilities Act.4. With the contraction of the currency the Banks have probably not had occasion to give credit to such a great extent to industry, and the corresponding needs of the agricultural community have only become urgent during this latter period. All the same, as the agricultural industry has reached a position similar to that of other industries, there seems to be a case for considering whether special credit should not be afforded for it, in order to.tide over the next few years, and if the Banks are not prepared to give agriculture credit except upon the lines which they have regularly followed in dealing with the farmer, it appears to me that his needs should be met from other sources.5. It is sometimes said that the farming industry is under-capitalised. This is only another way of saying that the profits from farming are small, and that if a fair remuneration be assigned to the farmer for his labour, the interest on his capital is low. This is the conclusion (put rather differently) that the United States Congress Commission on Agriculture came to in their Report published in 1921. Referring to a table printed by them, they say that &apos;&apos; the average income received b3r a farmer in pay for his labour, after deducting a return of 5 per cent, on his property, is far below the average earnings of employees in other industries.&quot;6. It should be kept in view that the ordinary English farmer is a working farmer. The directing farmer, who supervises the use of his capital invested in the farm, is in a minority.7. At the same time, modern farming requires a considerable amount of capital per acre.   In an old country, subject to the operation of the law of diminishing returns, such returns as are [9393] e 2
yielded eome more from the capital invested in the land than the actual land. This has become increasingly true as the farmers of old countries like ours have had to face the competition of produce from new lands, in which for a&apos; time the farmers are to a certain extent using up the capital formed by the stored-up fertility of virgin soil. The English farmer can hold his own, but with a larger outlay of capital, and in order to get an adequate return thereon probably a larger unit of farming is necessary. Hence the working farmer in England is put to various shifts to get enough working capital. Pie may have to get stock on credit from the auctioneer, and similarly fertilisers and feeding-stuffs from the merchants who deal in them. Hence, in order to get enough capital to work a farm, the farmer may have to call in outsiders, whose interest in some eases may almost amount to that of debenture holders or sleeping partners.8. Even short of this, it is generally recognised, as part of the normal procedure of farming, that the farmer should get short-term credits from a Bank in order to anticipate the passing of the interval in the farming year between the time when his outlays are greatest and the time when his returns are coming in. Such a practice is justified by the fact that the arable farmer tends to turn over his capital more slowly than other traders and producers. The United States Commission suggested that these short-term credits should be rather longer than has heretofore been the case. Thus they say that while &apos;&apos; in the case of crops six months may in some eases be sufficient, in the case of live-stock three years may be required.&quot;9. It is clear, however, that while, on such a principle, this or that special outlay may be the subject of a short-term credit, the total amount of accommodation given in this way cannot well exceed a certain proportion of the farmer&apos;s circulating capital. A rough test of the limit to be imposed might be given by saying that, while fertilisers and feeding-stuffs might form the subject of credits, rent and wages should not. So far as we could find out, the practice of the English Joint Stock Banks is to allow the farmer an overdraft for a few months in order to cover the time of his heavy seasonal outlays.10. An indication that the farming community is in need of something further than the ordinary short-term credits may be found in the fact that the Credit Sub-Committee of the English Agricultural Advisory Committee definitely recommended an extension of credit to wages payments in their Report issued in February last.11. There seems, in fact, to be a case for giving a section of the farming community at the. present time extraordinary accommodation to tide over the next few years, such as other industries were getting from the Banks during the so-called inflation period. The farmers are as entitled to quote their relatively high wages bill as were the &quot; industrials,&quot; to make good a similar claim. They are suffering from a collapse of the purchasing power of the urban population which forms their chief market, and the profits from which their capital is renewed have equally been eaten into by two bad seasons.12. There seems to be no reason why arable farming should not recover within a few years in this country. The former depression was long and gradual, but it succeeded a period of rising prices which was also fairly long. The rising prices were due largely to the series of wars which were carried on in Europe and America between 1854 and 1871, and the fall which would have come in any -ease as wealth was renewed after these wars was accelerated in Europe by the sudden development of the new corn lands in America -during the years of recovery after the American Civil War. The recent war period has been shorter, the rise and fall in prices have both been carried along very steep gradients, hence there is reason to hope that the recovery will be fairly rapid. Within the English farming community it is the arable farmer of the eastern counties whose difficulties are greatest. The dairy farmer of the west is working under easier conditions. His prices are better maintained, and in any case his returns come in at frequent and regular intervals, and generally speaking the counties north of the Trent,
9 -r 0 ti 10which find their markets near at hand in the great industrial areas of South Lancashire, the West Hiding, Durham and Tyneside, seem to be getting along better than those in the east and south of England, in which London and Birmingham areas are the chief markets. It is possible, too, that, owing to its geographical position, the London market is more accessible to foreign competition for such commodities as fruit and vegetables, including potatoes, from Normandy and the Low Countries than are the northern markets.18. If one can concentrate attention on the arable districts of the eastern counties, it is clear that the problem by being localised is less serious of solution. Thus there is an obvious difference between the agricultural conditions of such a county as Leicester and the Lindsey Division of Lincoln. While Leicester has in round figures 119,000 acres of arable land as against 845,000 acres of permanent grass, Lindsey has 563,000 acres of arable as against 289,000 acres of permanent grass. Leicester has less than one-third of the area which Lindsey has under wheat, less than one-tenth of the area which Lindsey has under barley, and between one-third and one-fourth of the area under oats. In potatoes and turnips the disparity is much greater, and also in clover and rotation grasses. These figures are striking, even when it is taken into consideration that Leicester has only about five-eighths of the area of Lindsey. In spite of the far greater area under crops in Lindsey, there are almost as many cattle and twice as many sheep and nearly three times as many pigs.It is scarcely necessary to add that great numbers of labourers are employed in these eastern arable counties, especially in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent, and possibly the most practical way of dealing with the problem would be to provide some means by which the wages bills might be met and the skilled labour kept in being in the arable areas in which the crops raised are sold off the farm for human consumption. The wages bill is the&apos; heavy item in the arable farmer&apos;s outla3&apos;s. It is here that he will look for a reduction, and it may not be an exaggeration to say that, just as the last agricultural depression was weathered by remissions on rent, the present one may be largely liquidated by reductions in wages. Further, while in large-scale industries many &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; have been carrying on their business for some time past with hardly any profit and mainly to keep them going, the farmer is too small a capitalist for this to be possible in agriculture.14. No system of separate loans to individual farmers seems to meet the case. What is wanted is a scheme that will be carried out by the joint and organised effort of the agricultural community in any district. It is suggested that something in the nature of a supplementary wages fund should be formed in a specified arable area similar to the funds built up under the National Health and Unemployment Insurance Acts.15. Under such a scheme the question would be treated as directly affecting labourers as well as farmers, and the former would be directly associated with the latter as beneficiaries of any advance to the fund from public funds. It must be recognised, in my view, that the agricultural industry can only bear its burdens if it organises itself in large groups like other industries, and takes concerted action in such groups.       *16. Any such fund would be constituted by contributions from farmers and labourers paid at regular, frequent intervals. An advance from public funds of a sum not less than their total joint contributions and repayable in a period of five to ten years might be made. Theoretically, every contributing employer of labour would have a right to apply to obtain from the fund a sum to cover a maximum of, say, one-fourth of his wages bill in any year. This sum might in part take the form of an advance.17. Obviously, the scheme could not succeed if any farmer contributing to the fund wanted assistance from it every year. It is accordingly to be hoped that any such scheme would be supported by large and well-to-do farmers, who would not need assistance from it.18. Other inducements might be offered to a farmer to secure a sparing use of the fund. A second appeal for assistance in a second year might justify&apos;only the issue of a loan.
19. A scheme could be brought into action in any area in. which two-thirds of the farmers and of the labourers, presently insured under the National Health Insurance Act, were ascertained to be willing to work such a scheme.20. Of course, under such a scheme any contributing employer-would be required to pay an agreed living wage, and it would be difficult to apply the scheme except to more or less regularly-employed labourers.21. As things are, the Unemployed Insurance Act of 1920 does not apply to agriculture. And agriculture was exempted generally on the footing that unemployment, as incident to other industries,, does not commonly arise in agriculture. There is undoubtedly always a market for agricultural produce, and under the conditions imposed by nature it is impossible to have spurts in agricultural production. At the same time, it is possible to have rather quick drops in prices which bring about what is the next worst thing to unemployment, and that is a low rate of earnings.22. Under present circumstances it will not be too difficult to-relieve the situation in agriculture at the expense of labour. In ordinary times the discontented agricultural labourer can drift in to the towns, but this escape from the conditions of his own calling is not open to him at present. The obvious alternative is for him to remain and take low wages. Hence, any scheme which obviates that alternative is for agriculture very much the equivalent of a scheme of Unemployment Insurance for other industries, and if other industries which are liable to bursts of unemployment can stand the greater part of the cost of unemploy-ment insurance, then agriculture should be able to bear the cost of a similar scheme for maintaining the rate of wages at the level of subsistence. In a sense, too, a scheme of this kind would have some of the characteristics of co-operative credit. The State loan would be secured upon the joint contributions of the farmers and labourers, and upon their willingness to see the scheme through.23. Mass action of this kind is to a certain extent novel in the farming community, but the more there is of it the better. The formation of branches of the National Farmers&apos; Union all over the country, and the growth of trade unionism among the agricultural labourers further facilitate such collective action, which in this country will more naturally flow in such directions as this than towards the various forms of association which have manifested themselves among peasant communities on the Continent.24. Though is is in my view necessary before all things that wages in agriculture should be maintained at a proper level, there is another direction in which credit would be useful at the present time, i.e., for the provision of fertilisers and feeding-stuffs through co-operative Trading Societies. High farming cannot be carried on without these; but if economies are to be made, it is possible that they should be used more sparingly at the present time.25. The law of diminishing returns almost certainly applies-to the ease of feeding-stuffs for fat stock beyond a certain point; and there seems reason to believe that the same may be true of fertilisers. At the same time, they are indispensable: and the ordinary farmer is well advised to get them through a co-operative Trading Society. Normally, such Societies require from their j members payment in cash, and in order to give credit it would be necessary for the Trading Societies to have rather more capital than they usually command. It might be possible for arrangements to be made for the banks to give such Societies reasonable aceom-modation for a term of years, if their solvency and efficiency were certified by a public Department. It will be objected that this is assisting co-operation in a manner unfair to the private trader. To this it seems fair to retort that if the urban population insists that the farmer is to make his way without protection and at the same time social considerations make it undesirable for the present form of our rural economy to be replaced by large farms extending to 2,000 acres, the town-dwelling majority has no right to deny the farmer every facility for collective purchase and sale, such as are the very minimum of improvement in the organisation of an industry which is fatally handicapped by being carried on in a very great number of small units.
19. A scheme could be brought into action in any area in which two-thirds of the farmers and of the labourers, presently insured under the National Health Insurance Act, were ascertained to be willing to work such a scheme.20. Of course, under such a scheme any contributing employer&quot; would be required to pay an agreed living wage, and it would be difficult to apply the scheme except to more or less regularly-employed labourers.21. As things are, the Unemployed Insurance Act of 1920 does not apply to agriculture. And agriculture was exempted generally on the footing that unemployment, as incident to other industries,, does not commonly ai&apos;ise in agriculture. There is undoubtedly always a market for agricultural produce, and under the conditions imposed by nature it is impossible to have spurts in agricultural production. At the same time, it is possible to have rather quick drops in prices which bring about what is the next worst thing to unemployment, and that is a low rate of earnings.22. Under present circumstances it will not be too difficult to-relieve the situation in agriculture at the expense of labour. In ordinary times the discontented agricultural labourer can drift in to the towns, but this escape from the conditions of his own calling is not open to him at present. The obvious alternative is for him to remain and take low wages. Hence, any scheme which obviates that alternative is for agriculture very much the equivalent of a scheme of Unemployment Insurance for other industries, and if other industries which are liable to bursts of unemployment can stand the greater part of the cost of unemploy-ment insurance, then agriculture should be able to bear the cost of a similar scheme for maintaining the rate of wages at the level of subsistence. In a sense, too, a scheme of this kind would have some of the characteristics of co-operative credit. The State loan would be secured upon the joint contributions of the farmers and labourers, and upon their willingness to see the scheme through.23. Mass action of this kind is to a certain extent novel in the farming community, but the more there is of it the better. The formation of branches of the National Farmers&apos; Union all over the country, and the growth of trade unionism among the agricultural labourers further facilitate such collective action, which in this country will more naturally flow in such directions as this than towards the various forms of association which have manifested themselves among peasant communities on the Continent.24. Though it is in my view necessary before all things that wages in agriculture should be maintained at a proper level, there is another direction in which credit would be useful at the present time, i.e., for the provision of fertilisers and feeding-stuffs through co-operative Trading Societies. High farming cannot be carried&apos; on without these; but if economies are to be made, it is possible that they should be used more sparingly at the present time.25. The law of diminishing returns almost certainly applies-to the case of feeding-stuffs for fat stock be37ond a certain point; and there seems reason to believe that the same may be true of fertilisers. At the same time, they are indispensable; and the ordinary farmer is well advised to get them through a co-operative Trading Society. Normally, such Societies require from their members payment in cash, and in order to give credit it would be necessary for the Trading Societies to have rather more capital than they usually command. It might be possible for arrangements to be made for the banks to give such Societies reasonable accom-modation for a term of years, if their solvency and efficiency were certified by a public Department. It will be objected that this is assisting co-operation in a manner unfair to the private trader. To this it seems fair to retort that if the urban population insists that the farmer is to make his way without protection and at the same time social considerations make it undesirable for the present form of our rural economy to be replaced by large farms extending to 2,000 acres, the town-dwelling majority has no right to deny the farmer every facility for collective purchase and sale, such as are the very minimum of improvement in the organisation of an industry which is fatally handicapped by being carried on in a very great number of small units.
26. With some such measures the arable farming industry of /this country should have time to look round. Merely to put arable land back everywhere under grass for stock raising would put England back to where a country like Hungary was a hundred years ago. We tend to fail where agricultural processes become complicated. We breed and feed stock well and grow good staple crops. Our farming, however, is conducted on the assumption that the town consumer should always be prepared to take the produce just as it leaves the farmer. Perhaps this is the result of our farmers having had earlier than those of other countries a considerable market near at hand in the form of a numerous town population. Certainly we are backward at working up agricultural produce, except in cheese-making and bacon-curing.27. The farmers in such continental countries as Germany, Belgium, Bohemia and Northern Prance have a great advantage over our arable farmers in respect that two of their most important crops, sugar-beet and potatoes, are the raw material of industry. With us agriculture is not thus :o-ordinated with industry. Our root crops are only grown to be eaten by stock, and if the whole of our potatoes cannot be consumed at once by the urban population, the farmer who grows potatoes is in a bad way.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.
