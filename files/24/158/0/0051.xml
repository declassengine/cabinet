January 1923. j cabinet.SEPARATE ANNUAL BILL FOR CONTINUANCE AND AMENDMENTOF AIR FORCE ACT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I WISH to urge upon the Cabinet, the desirability of the continuance and amendment of the Army Act and Air Force Act being undertaken this year by separate bills. Hitherto, owing to Parliamentary exigencies, it has not been thought practicable to adopt this procedure, and the continuing and amending bill has been a joint bill to amend both acts divided into three parts, containing (a.) Amendments peculiar to the Army Act. (b.) Amendments peculiar to the Air Force Act. (c.) Amendments common to both Acts.I attach the highest importance to the introduction of separate bills, for the following reasons: 1. Although the Air Force Act as originally framed was based on the Army Act (being in fact the Army Act modified in accordance with tlie provisions of the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917), it cannot remain identical with that act. The code governing the Royal Air Force as a separate service should be developed on the lines best suited to the very different conditions of that service, which in some respects approximate more closely to those of the Navy than those of the Army, and free scope for that development and for its consideration by Parliament cannot be attained by a system under which Air Force Act amendments are included in a bill which is necessarily associated in the minds of most with the maintenance of the Army.2. My main reason for advancing this proposal as one of urgent importance is that the present system of a combined Army and Air Force (Annual) Act has undoubtedly given rise to a widespread belief that the establish-ment of the Air Ministry as a separate Department of State has not yet been fully determined and that the Royal Air Force has not even now attained a permanent independent status comparable to that of the Navy and Army. This mistaken belief has a two-fold reaction on the well-being of the Force internal and external. Inside the Force, those who do not understand the realities of the position are exercised by the fear that they have not that security of. tenure which is enjoyed by the older services; whilst those who are better informed feel that the continued merger in an Army Bill of an essential piece of Royal Air Force legislation is derogatory. Outside, would-be recruits and parents, who would otherwise be disposed to enter their sons as cadets or boy mechanics are deterred by doubts as to whether the Royal Air Force is in a position to offer them a stable career.S.
