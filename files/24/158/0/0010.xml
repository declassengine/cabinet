(&amp;Jc fit iis Document is the proper*ty of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,!CABINET. ...... I 21 v r oboTHE ANInUAL REGISTER PROPOSAL,Memorandum by;the Home Secretary.It is desired to obtain a deoision of the Cabinet on the polioy of introducing legislation to authorise the preparation of a single annual register of electors in plaoe of the two half yearly registers.   Attached is a copy of a Bill for the purpose whioh has been prepared at the request Of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who desires the change in view of the eoonomy which it will effect.The matter has been deferred to or various oocasiona during the life of the last Parliament.   Oh the 15th november 192;), the Prime Minister, then Leader of the House, stated in reply to A Question that in view of the large saving likely to result the Government would be glad to see adopted the proposal for one register per annum instead of two and that &quot;if it commends itself generally to the House, they would be prepared to introduce legislation accordingly as soon as possible.&quot;Subsequently 270&apos; members of the last Parliament expressed themselves in favour of an annual. register; and on the 24th February, 1921, the then Minister of Health brought the subject before the Cabinet, who at a meeting of 4th March, 1921, asked that the views of the Government Whips should be obtained.The late chief Unionist Whip and his successor the present Vftiip eaoh reported in favour of the change, but the chief Liberal Whips stated that the proposal would meet with almost unanimous opposition from Coalition Liberals,   It was understood also that the Independent Liberal and Labour Parties would strongly iresist the change,A memorandum (C,P, 3881) dealing with the question, was circulated to the Cabinet by the late Home Secretary on 23rd March, 1922,. but no decision was reached.During the passage of - the Government Bill of last Session to extend the time for preparing the registers, amendments raising the question of an annual register.wers put down by several members but were ruled out of order.   Later in the Session the First Reading of a Bill, introduced by Mr, D. Herbert to restore an annual register, was only agreed to after a division by 200 to 112,   The Bill did not progress further.The main considerations to be borne in mind are these:-1, The system of two Registers a year which was introduced by the Representation of the People Aot 1918 is generally regarded as an integral part of the compromise reached by the Speaker1s Conference on whose recommendations the Aot was based.   Previously one register only in the year was prepared.
again at 10 o&apos;clock tonight and were informed that after consultation president of commission would recommend unanimity and president would endorse settle-ment on basis of 3 per cent interest for first ten. years and 3  per cent thereafter,     Sinking fund would be at rate of half per cent throughout payable yearly or every three or five years.    This would be sufficient to amortise debt in about 62 years.     They offered moreover to recalculate back interest at 4  instead of 5 per cento    This proposal means 161 million dollars yearly for first ten years and 184 million dollars for remaining 52 years,    I believe we should obtain option to pay principal and interest in United States government bonds and date at par, and an option to pre-pay principal at any time upon due notice. These options would make bonds practically unmarket-able.    We are all three convinced that these are best terms we can (group omitted).    They represent a tremendous advance in .American opinion.    Moreover it must not be forgotten that we are tied hand and foot by terms of our existing obligations and I beg you to consider the only alternative to immediate acceptance of present offer,Eeport to Congress will be made by commission de-tailing firstly,original terms of His Majesty1s Govern-menfs obligations and secondly, offer of commission which would have been refused,   . This will be followedby request to His Majesty&apos;s Government to pay regular-ly under original terms.What then will be position of His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment?I referred above to &quot;immediate&quot; acceptance be-cause failing acceptance within next few days it willbe
-a-2, All General Elections within the last IS years have taken place during the period of the six winter months covered by the present Autumn Register, and all ordinary elections of local authorities take place during the same period,   The Autumn Register is therefore mere important than the Spring Register,,   But many Bye-elections of course take place on the latter;   and the political atmosphere of the second quarter of 1922 hardly justified much confidence in the view that a General Election will never be held during the currency of the Spring Register.3. The substitution of one Register for two would defer the inclusion, in the Register for a constituency, of electors who have removed to the constituency and of persons newly qualified.   In the event of an eleotion during the present Spring Register period the former oould vote in their old constituencies only, and the latter could not vote at all.   The extent to which this consideration would operate is indicated by the fact that the new names included in any half yearly register are on the average 5 to 5K$ of the total electorate, the proportion varying substantially in different areas;   e,g, in Islington the new names are over 10,000 on a total electorate of 15.% 000,4. The change would effect a saving of approximately  250,000 per annum, half of which aoorues to the Exchequer and half to local rates. The total yearly cost of the two registers   is now about  992,000 ( 640,000 for compilation and  352,000 for printing),   The eoonomy may be reduced below  200,000, if, as appears probable, the change necessitates a reversion to the earlier and more expensive method of publishing the electors lists;&apos;&quot; while there is some risk of higher printing charges being incurred in consequence of the work becoming more seasonal.SUPPLEMENTARY REGISTER SCHEME,While tho Bill submitted has been prepared, at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to embody the single annual register proposal, mention might perhaps be-made of another proposal which has been under examination and which, though productive of considerable eoonomy, would involve a less drastic curtailment of franchise rights.   A complete register to remain in foroe for one year would be prepared in respect of the Autumn qualifying period.   The qualification in respect of the Spring Register qualifying period would remain, but there would be no canvass by the*The electors Lists are the provisional Register prepared hy the Registration Officer as a result of his oanvass, eto0 and are published to give an onnertunity for claims and objections to be made before the final Register is printed off.   At or.o time the Electors Lists, and the final Register of eaoh half yearly occasion were separately, printed throughout, but in 1920 the present method,was instituted oi publishing composite electors Lists consisting of (a;.the previous half-yearly Register;    (bj a list of additions; and (o) a list of deletions..    After claims and objections have been dealt with on the composite Electors Lists the three lists aro combined in a final clean Register.
10th January, 1933.Registration Officer, and those persons only who choose to make claims would be registered in respect of that period,,   A list of such claimants would be printed as a supplement- to the main annual register,   This would effect a saving estimated at S154,000, reduced to ,-6110,000 if it became necessary to revert to the more expensive previous system of publishing the Electors Lists,!   This saving could be increased to about  217,000 by arranging for the main register&apos; to-be issued without any previous printing and publication of electors lists!    on this plan claims and objections could be made on the register as issued, and the results included in short lists printed as supplements to the main register.   This scheme is, however, open to the objection that it involves the use at elections of composite registers., i,e, registers consisting cf tv,o or more documents supplementing or correcting one another.   The introduction of this principle is looked upon with considerable apprehension by Registration Officers and Party Agents who on several occasions have advised that the use of composite registers at elections would entail very serious risks.The scheme is also open to the objection that the claims for the Spring Register period would in large measure have to be initiated by the Party Agents and would thus merely transfer to the political organisations much if not all the expense saved to the Exchequer by suppressing the Spring Register canvass,   Moreover, as no revision of the main annual register would be made upon the issue of the Spring Register, there would be a very large number of duplicate registrations.In view of these objections it does not appear that the supplemental register scheme is a practicable alternative to the annual register.;V. 0.
