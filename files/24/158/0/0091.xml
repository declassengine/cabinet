Before the war upwards of one-third of our Export Trade was done directly with Europe.    Indirectly, we were still more dependent upon European purchasing power, because credits created by Indian and Chinese sales in Europe were used for financing Eastern purchases from Britain.   The Russian
debacle, the, probable collapse of Germany,; the general uncertainty and reduced production In other countries, the uneconomic frontiers of new States, coupled with a polioyof high protection and trade restrictions, make it certain that&apos;for many years to come our trade with&apos; Europe cannot reach&apos;anything like &quot;normal proportions.(4)   It is eminently desirable that we should purchase more raw materia,&quot;&apos;^ within kirs Empire and less fromMthe United States^   In the-i-oase of cotton,, in addition to the financial advantages of increasing our production and purchases within the Empire, there is a dangerous risk of an aotual shortage of supplies, whioh can only be safeguarded by an intensive increase of cultivation of ootton in the Empire^(5)   The development is bound to be very slow unless the Imperial Sovercment will give direct financial assistanoe,(6)   Such a use of credit will undoubtedly pay. Expenditure on unemployment relief will be reduced, both by th? placing of orders and by the openings for emigrants; and expenditure cf this kind creates growing markets with a complementary trade for the future.   Nor is it fair yOJ contend that prices will be proportionately increased. Factories running on partial production mean high costs; if the factories are filled costs are reduced.In these circumstances&apos;, we think it essential that we should, is scon as possible;, obtain statutory powers which, within a given financial limit, will permit the Secretary cf State for the Colonies a wide discretion in assisting suitable schemes.    .7e therefore suggest that a Bill should be introduced giving the Secretary of State
powor to sues ici go bo homes bf  mporijjl development, subjoot to a finsnoial limit that the annual ooot to tho Imperial Exchequer should not exceed  2,000,000 ;; a ye-:.r.   This power should be ezercisable either by the payment or. advance of interest in whole or in part for a term of years during the constructional jperiod or until the scheme becomes revenue producing; , Ior by the direot loan of money at a cheap rate, or by a combination of these two methods. JIt is suggested that the power of the Secretary: iof State under this Bill to approve new schemes should belimited to a period of ten years from the passing of an ;Act and that as regards schemes involving tho payment or advance of interest as distinct from the loan of capitalat a cheap rate, liability tp make such payments or advancesunder any approved scheme should terminate within fifteen years from the passing of the Aot,   Direct, loans should;,be made repayable within a period not exceeding thirty years from the date of issue, whatever that date may bo.The attached memorandum gives a list of develop-ment schemes which have been prepared in detail by the Colonial Office, and which could be rapidly put in hand. They are all .schemes which form part of the normal development programme of the Crown Colonies, but which, owing to the present financial resources of the Colonies, could only be put in hand over a long period of years,, unless the Imperial Government is prepared to finance thorn in the initial stages.The schemes to be assisted should be defined as works providing improved facilities for transport; the provision of railway locomotives and rolling stock and other forms of transport; and works of public utility generally,   !:Public utility&quot; would cover water
8.2.23supply, drainage,, reclamation and sea defence, and the supply of power and light.The great majority of the schemes in the list would he financed by loans raised uireotly by the Colon! backed by tha undertaking of the Imperial Government of a guarantee or advance of interest during the initial period,   The Colonial Office are satisfied that in-&apos; eaoh case they could deal with the case on its merits, and in accordance with&apos; the financial capacity of each Colony, so as to limit the period of free or postponed interest to the shortest term which is fair and&apos;-practicable in all the oir-oumstarices?(Signed)   DEVONSHIRE&quot; P.

^ fl 9LOCOMOTIVES, RAILWAY ROLLING STOCK, AND MOTOR TRANSPORT.It is believed that some of the larger Colonies would be prepared to place additional orders for locomotives, rolling stock, etc, if satisfactory&apos; financial terms could be arranged.     Definite figures cannot be given without reference to the Colonies, but it would be necessary to give the Colonies at least an outline of the financial terms before asking them what additional orders they -could place,
With reference to the proposals for the grant of assistance to certain Colonies for the development of their resources, I would draw attention to the Ceylon Hydro Electric Scheme.     This is a project for utilising the water power of certain rivers in Ceylon.     It has been examined and reported upon by the Electrical Adviser to the Government of India, and a scheme has been prepared and criticised by the Consulting Engineers to: the-Crown Agents.     The scheme provides for construction in three stages, but it Is proposed, to proceed with the first stage only at present.     This first stage is estimated to cost about  l,000,000j and the Governor and Executive Council have expressed the opinion that the first stage is financially sound and would be self-supporting on a moderate estimate of the demand likely to arise for power to drive machinery, etc. already in existence.     The legislative Council, who are very much opposed to any increase of liabilities at the moment, have so far declined to make financial provision for the scheme, and their attitude has been affected to some extent   by dls-a-greemsnts as to the appointment of a Chairman of the : Board tl control the scheme0     It seems, however, probable that if adequate financial assistance were afforded the   &apos; Ceylon Government would be prepared-to proceed at once with the scheme-; for which plans and specifications are well advanced.    &quot;&quot;Details of the scheme are shown in a recent sessional taper which could eventually be put before any Committee if desired.
