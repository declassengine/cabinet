(This document is the property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government.)C R g T.GAB I HE?.P. 68(S3),HOME   AFFAIRS   COMMITTEE.PETROLEUM   B I L L.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Committee Of Imperial Defence in a memorandum dated the 16th September, 1921 (278 - B) called attention to -(a) The importance of safeguarding in time of emergenoy supplies of oil fuel and light petroleum products suitable for naval, military or air purposes, (b) The necessity for ensuring the safety of important defences which might be damaged or otherwise rendered ineffective by the ignition of the supplies.They recommended that there should be direct Government control of petroleum storage and that a licence to be issued by the Home Seoretary should be neoessary before the   ereotion is commenced of any installation for the storage of 6,000 tons or more of oil fuel and 1,000 tons or more of petroleum spirit in the United Kingdom, and suggested that, in view of the inoreased importance of preserving all such supplies in times of emergency and of safeguarding them against attack, the details of the proposed site of any such installation should be referred to them for consideration from the defence point of view before being finally approved.Legislation is necessary to carry out these recommendations and the attached Bill provides for the licensing system reoommendod.   At present, all installations large or small, used for the storage of petroleum spirit require the licence of the local authority, and the effect of the Bill therefore, so far as they are concerned, is only to substitute in the case of the large installations the licence of the Secretary of State for that of the local authority.   Installations for the storage of petroleum other than petroleum spirit do not at present require as such to be lioensed under the Act of 1871, but I am informed that all, or almost all, the large installations which will he affected by the Bill are used for both kinds of storage.The Bill also makes certain other amendments in the Petroleum Acts, especially for improving the control over the conveyance of petroleum by road and on ship, which were reoommended by a Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Office in 1913, and some of which are urgently required&quot;   She Bill is not likely to excite any controversy and I ask authority for its immediate introduction,,2nd February, 1923.V/. 0.
