[This Document is the Property of His-Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] -/Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 78 (23).CABINET.IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a telegram which I have just received from colonial Office, February 5, 1923.February 2. Prime Minister has asked me to send following telegram to you. (Begins.) In reply to your telegram of 29th November re proposed Economic Conference, Commonwealth is alive to the importance of improving the Empire economic relations and, as you know, Prime Minister holds very decided views on the necessity of developing the Empire&apos;s trade and&apos; has set these out on very many occasions in Britain both during and after the war.Australia has done everything in her power to encourage trade between various parts of the Empire and particularly with Great Britain. She has given Britain very great advantage under her tariff, has concluded a reciprocal tariff with New Zealand and is carrying on negotiations with Canada for a similar purpose.As the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom knows, while under the Common-wealth tariff Britain is accorded preference on practically every item, the preference granted to Australia under British tariff does not go very far and Australian goods have to face very keen competition of foreign countries in British markets. Quite recently, as is well known, a most invidious distinction was made between Canadian and Australian products under the Cattle Embargo Act. The position, then, seems to be one which calls for action by Britain rather than mere discussion. If you want us: to buy more British goods there is only one way in which it can be done, Britain must buy more Australian products; that is the position. And it is respectfully suggested that Britain might with great advantage to herself and to the Empire give products of Australia preference over foreign goods in British markets.It is not necessary to stress the importance of Empire trade development or value of Dominions&apos; markets for British goods. Australia is one of the very best markets British manufacturers have. No European country compares with it and if given suitable encouragement it will become a still better market. All facts are perfectly well known; a Conference cannot alter them nor can it do anything more than pass the resolution. What is really wanted is action by Britain. (Ends.)  Governor-General .Australia.DEVONSHIRE.[9468]
