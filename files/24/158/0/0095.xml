[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1923.SECRET CP. 94 (23).CABINET.OVERSEAS TRADE.Note by the President of the. Board&apos; op-Trade.I HAYE had the attached tables prepared in order that, in dealing with questions of economic policy, the Cabinet may have a clear picture of the volume and destination of our Export Trade in 1913 and since the War.Table (A) shows the proportionate distribution of our Export Trade among the various groups of markets.Table (B) shows the deficiency or increase in the estimated volume of our Export Trade to the various groups of markets, as compared with 1913.In both tables figures are given for complete years in 1913, 1920, 1921 and 1922, and also for the; final quarter of 1922.In order to make the comparisons of estimated trade volume shown in Table (B) current values for the years 1920, 1921 and 1922 have been adjusted by reduction to the common basis of 1913 prices; but it will be appreciated that the figures so obtained can only be taken as a rough approximation, since the character of exports to particular destinations varies, and the price movements of different classes of commodities have also varied considerably.Notwithstanding this margin of error, I think the tables afford a valuable picture of the course of our Export Trade in the past, and a useful indication of future prospects.(Initialled)     P.

Table (B)a-Estimated Trade Volume.NnTE. The estimated volume of trade as compared with that of the year 1913 is calculated by correcting the declared value of exports to each country, or group of countries, proportionately to the ascertained rise of average prices for exports to all destinations. Such estimates involve an element 01&apos; error, Bince (a) the composition of export trade to a particular destination is not identical with that of export trade as a whole, and (b) the price movement for different classes of goods shows considerable variation. The figures for trade volume to particular destinations can therefore only be regarded as giving a rough indication of relative changes,1913.Estimated Volume (i.e., Estimated Value at Price Level of 1913).GrEOUP AND COUNTBIES.																1 ?
