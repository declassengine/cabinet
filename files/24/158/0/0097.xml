IIS DOCUMENT IS&apos;THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.THE   ROAD   FUND.SECRET.CP. 96 (23) .: MEMORANDUM BY THB MINISTER OP LABOUR- ,I desire to reinforce the view expressed by the Minister of Transport in his Memoranda CP. 75 (23) and CP. 84 (23&apos;).     He points out that the programmes of work which he has recently suggested to the Unemployment Committee have been put forward with the sole object of assisting in the relief of unemployment in a practical manner.     As I understand it, the schemes in question have been the subject of discussion between the Minister of Transport and the Local Authorities for some time and in many oases the. sohemes have now reached the,point at which the work can be put In hand as soon as the authority of the Minister is given.     Indeed, unless the Minister of Transports proposals are approved by tho Cabinet, It will be neoessary now for Colonel Ashley to write ,to the Local Authorities (who have been consistently urged by the . Government to put forward schemes) and say that the money is not now forthcoming; this seems to me to be an extremely unsatisfactory attitude for the Government to adopt.As I stated in my Memorandum, of the 30th January, (CP. 59 (23)), the Road Sohemes have figured most prominently among tho measures taken, by the Government with a view to providing work in relief of unemployment.At
It seotaa- to me that it would be a short-Bighted policy to attempt to hold up the putting in hand of these schemes, more especially as the money to bo utilised does not mean a direct charge upon the Exchequer but is drawn from the anticipated revenues of the Road Fund.To stop tho progress of the Road Scheme policy would mean the stoppage of so large a proportion of the reliof work that is being assisted by tho Government that we might shortly find ourselves forced to adopt some other method of finding work   a method which would be bound to involve a hoavy direct charge upon the Exchequer.(Initialled)   M. B.Ministry of Labour. 15th February, 1923,
