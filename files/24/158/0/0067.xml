It appeared to be advisable for us to consider andreport upon the question of this History without delay, asconsiderable cost to the Stationery Office is involved in the storage of ths type 1&apos;. or these twelve volumes.It has been pointed out to the Committee that Volumes9 - 12 contain highly secret matter, tfhieh it would be undesir-able to issue to the Public.     The cost of the revision necessary before these volumes would be suitable for issue would be considerable,5.     The dommittee are of the opinion;-(a) That the cost of re-printing the present Volumes I to XII aoull not be justified;(b) That Sir Graham Greene should be authorised to give instructions for the breaking up of the&quot;existing.&quot;type&quot; of the History of the Ministry of Munitions;
