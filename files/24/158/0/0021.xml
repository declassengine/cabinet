ii. .     .      . .  i .   .   ,. 158following from Prime.-Minister to Ghanc-ellor of the -Sxche-quer. No. 22. Despatched -January 17th.  1923. I think it undesirable that ambassador should come.In first place it will look too much as if he were coming to nut pressure on Government here and in addition he mightbe required for discussion with American Government afteryour return,I am, as I am sure you know, most unwilling to differ from you but, si.:;ce you left, the reasons against making a settlement now st a high rate have been greatly strengthened. The action of the French may destroy hope of reparations and with it any chance of our being paid debts due to us.    It may also so damage chance of recovery of trade as to make position here worse and there, is always the chance, and with this big annual payment of dollars a real danger, that the exchange may go seriously..against us and greatly add to tho annual burden-. .&apos;I suppose there would be no chance of America accepting payment in sterling based on present rate of exchange.i&apos;.l.iyw
