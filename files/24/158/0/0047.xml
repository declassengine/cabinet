[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maiesty&apos;8 Government, and should&quot; bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] 315SWITSS5I.AH).POLITICAL.from Lord Curzon (Lausanns)January 24th, 1923.D. January 24th, 1923.H*   8.20 a.m.   January 26th, 1923.No. 231.i] *^FAFI, X.(Private   (For Cabinet but not for print).I will attempt to depict situation.   Bompard having come hack with instructions which I described in an earlier telegram, Barrere affected an Illness which had no real foundation, declining to be a party to concessions which he though disgraceful.   Whether this was a display of conscience or of cowardice, on hiE. part is immaterial.   Anyhow it left in command Bompard, a confirmed partisan who years ago bowed his head in the temple of Kimmon at Stamboul.    His tactics are plain.    He thinks we ought to remain here for another fortnight, reopening every discussion, and gradually whittling away every point for whicl we have hitherto stood out in order to obtain signature of a treaty which would constitute an allied humiliation. With this object in view meetings of commissions or sub-commissions for which he is responsible are spun out or delayed on various pleas, and some fresh excn.se is invented daily for postponement.    Meanwhile the French and Turks who live in same hotel fraternise.Everything......
Everything that passes or is in contemplation is disclosed to latter; and at night there is abundant hob-nobbing over champagne.    The custom of enter-taining the Turks which was started by the French, has been pursued by other delegations, and the spectacle may be witnessed nightly of the French and Italian delegates joking and clinking glasses with the men by whom the allies were openly affronted in the conference chamber only an hour or two before. Having done my duty by giving one such entertainment to all the delegations, I have for some time desisted from these amenities, which disgust our people and can only give the Turks an impression of complete allied . hypocrisy.    Meanwhile text of treaty is much advanced and should be ready for presentation.Bompard has not yet attempted to introduce into it the various forms of capitulation proposed by Poincare&quot; and I have told him plainly that I cannot accept them.    Italians wobble from one side to the other with an invariable preference for retreat.   Thus the British are in a constant minority, for the two other allies and the Turks may be said to constitute a working alliance.Next as to presentation of treaty.   It had been definitely agreed to present this at a plenary meeting of the conference and I had told Barrere that as senior foreign delegate I claimed the right to do it.Barrere thereupon, resting; his case upon a technical interpretation of the rules which lay down that the plenary sittings of the conference shall bepresided......
presided over by the three presidents in turn, claimed that I had exhausted my right by having been put in the Chair at the preliminary meeting which laid down the order of procedure, and declared that the honour of Prance would be fatally Impaired unless he adhered to his claim.   I.did not in the least care about amour propre - though I confess that the spectacle of the Peace Treaty being presented by an ambassador while a Secretary of State is present struck me as both invidious and improper.   But I was afraid of what might happen if the French or Italians were in the Chair and the Turks made a demonstration or raised some fresh issue which I knew that my colleagues from their, inexperience of public meetings, would be powerless to cope with.Barrere&apos;s claim was supported by Poincare&apos;   and is clung to with even greater desperation by Bompard, in proportion to his own Inferior status.    His method of escaping the difficulty and making a final kowtow to the Turks was accordingly to have no plenary meeting of the conference at all, but either to have three separate sittings of the three commissions, at which each president in turn would offer his slice of the truncated treaty with the proper supplicatory gesture, or to send *ound the treaty in an envelope.    That an international conference after sitting for over two months should not dare to meet to present the result of its labours, or that the final attitude of the Turks would be determined by the difference between the two methods&apos; of presentation did not strike M, Bompard as considerations of the least moment compared with the necessity for a crowning display
of allied humility.PART II.     (For circulation in print).In view of the situation I convened a meeting with M. Bompard and Marquis Garroni this afternoon, in order to bring matters to a head.    Rumbold and Crowe were also present and the meeting lasted 21-hour s .I began by recapitulating various stages of postponement to which I have been forced by proceeding of the French and Italian delegations, and said that orders of His Majesty&apos;s Government did not permit me -to continue this process indefinitely.    It would therefore be necessary for me to leave next week and when I went I should not go alone but should take entire British delegation with me.    Treaty must there fore be presented before that date.    For this I proposed following time table.    All meetings of commissions and sub-committees to be concluded by Friday evening.    The text of treaty, which is far advanced, to be completed on Saturday, to be^read or reviewed If thought necessary by the principal allied delegates on Sunday and to be handed confidentially to the remaining allies on that evening, and to the Turks on the following day.    The meeting at which the formal presentation to the Turks shall be made, to take place on Wednesday, discussion of Straits con-vention, if demanded by the Turks or Russians to be held on Thursday, departure of British delegation Friday.     This will admit of an extra day should I be driven....
driven to it,    tut will mean, unless unforeseen Obstacles occur; my return at latest on Sunday February 5th.    I told my colleagues that unless this plan were adopted I shoul have no alternative but to publish a full statement of our recent deplorable procedure, and to place the responsibility on the right shoulders.After many protestations of Injured innocence this time table was accepted by the allies, and I propose at once by making tentative enquiries of the railway company to let the plan leak out.   I then said that our departure must involve the retirement not of a single delegation but of all, in order to avoid on the one hand the appearance of allied disunion, and on the other the risk of a Turkish attempt to reopen discussion with the party or parties left behind. This was received with enthusiasm by Marquis Garroni, who has strong domestic propensities, and with chastened satisfaction by Monsieur Bompard.    The allies will leave behind one or two competent officials of the Fromageot type, to give such explanations as the Turks may require.We next discussed the manner of presentation.   I said it was almost incredible to me that Monsieur Polncare or anyone should be so nervous as to be afraid of holding a plenary session of the conference, which would in these circumstances adjourn without ever having met at all except to fix our procedure ten weeks earlier.    Monsieur Bompard wanted, the text of treaty
to be sent by the three presidents in a letter. Marquis Garronl suggested three meetings of the three commis-sions to present the treaty in three parts, and then a fourth or plenary meeting to dispel the illusion that we were not united,I ended by proposing, nominally to oblige Monsieur Bompard, but in reality in order to escape a plenary sitting presided over by him with its perilous possi-bilities, that as the conference and the commissions consist of exactly the same persons under a different name, we should convoke the three commissions at the same time  on Wednesday next for the presentation of the treaty,   I would preside over the first and explain the treaty from my point of view, then ceding the Chair to Garronl who would explain his clauses, and he to Bompard who would explain his.    In practice it will be found that any reply would have to be made by me.   Even this simple but rather childish arrangement which after all concerns nobody but ourselves was not accepted by Monsieur Bompard who said he could not agree without the permission of Monsieur Poincare*.    I could not refrain from asking how Kis Excellency came to be described as a plenipotentiary at all and added that my government could not consent that the procedure of the conference should be dictated from Paris, and that I Intended to act in the manner proposed.  Another difficulty was raised when both Bompard and Garronl said that they could not sign the treaty without send-ing the full text to Paris and Borne for examination and....
and approval by their respective governments - an operation which would necessarily waste another week or more of time.   I pointed out that there was nothing to prevent them from sending the text in sections, as I was sure that they had already done: but said that if the whole treaty was either to be delayed by the above procedure or to be returned, with suggestions for amendment, there would be no British delegation to sign it when it arrived,I also told Monsieur Bompard as regards the capital concessions suggested by Monsieur Poincare\ that I could not adir.it that the head of any of the three allied governments was justified in proposing a re-castlng of the whole instrument at the last moment and that I could not accept any of them.   Ke then dropped the matter.The treaty to be thus presented will contain at least twenty provisions, affecting Prance and Italy equally with if not more than ourselves, which Turks, if we may judge from their protestations, will refuse to accept.    Question of Mosul will only appear in the form of a clause to the effect that that section of the Turkish frontier is referred for decision to the League of Nations.   Thus I think I&amp;all have carried out my promise to the Prime Minister, that if we split it will not be on that rock either primarily or alone. As to attitude of Turks I regard immediate or early signature by them as out of the question.   But it is certain that between now and next Wednesday French and italians.....
Italians will be busily at them to prevent abruptrefusal.    Indeed it is more than probable that Born-pard will tell them of the tender heart of MonsieurPoincar  and will ask them to believe that if theywait awhile its friendly pulsations will awake acorresponding beat in London and Home and that Turkeyby being patient will end by obtaining all that shedesires.   I anticipate therefore that after expressingprofound disgust and indignation Ismet will state his intention either to consult Angora or to defer his finaldecision.   He may even try to start fresh colloquieswhich of course my plan will defeat.    We should however declare our willingness to meet them again for signature whenever they desire and after all the future will be in our own hands, since His Majesty&apos;s Govern-merit if they require me to come out again to thisdetestable place can formulate the conditions on whichI am to do so.There remains of course the contingency thatwhether Turks refuse at once, or delay refusal, they mayhave recourse to military movements of a menacingcharacter, which might lead to resumption of hostilities.I think that the omens on the whole are against sucha course both because the French will strain everynerve to keep them quiet, knowing that a Franco-Britishrupture in the   East will mean the disappearance of thelast shred of our toleration in the ruhr, and becausethe Turks are in deadly terror of the revived Greek army, which might seize any such occasion for pushing its claims.   But here on the threshold of the region of speculation, I desist.
