In view of the great advantage of removing misconceptions which prevail, particularly in regard to the, scope of the enquiry, I have&apos;authorised the Government of India to make the proposed announcement, which I rshall also, make public in this country. 22nd. January 1923.Peel.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated S 1st December 1922.4-927. Viceroy. Correspondence ending with your telegram of 23rd November. MacDonnell Committee Report. His Majesty&apos;s Government have reviewed situation which was reviewed by MacDonnell Committee&apos;in.-regard &apos;to recruitment for the services, and have reached conclusion in favour of. appointment of ;.a Royal Commission on the Services in India, with the following terms of reference. ;&apos;.&apos;.&apos;&quot; Having regard to the necessity of maintaining a standard of administration in conformity with the responsibilities of the Crown for the Government of&quot; India, and to the declared policy of Parliament in respect of the admission of Indians to every branch of. the administration, to enquire into the organisation of the superior administrative services in India, with reference to the functions they should exercise,. the general conditions of service, financial and otherwise, under which they can best perform those functions, and methods of ensuring satisfactory recruitment of Europeans and Indians^ respectively, and to make recommendations.&quot; -;       .      -It will be observed that draft terms of, reference ,ar.e, framed on the basis of concluding part of the supplementary note to Mac Donnell Committee Report. His Majesty&apos;? Government are impressed with the force of the considerations in favour of enquiry in this direction, and are of opinion that it is desirable to institute sucli an enquiry now that sufficient experience has been gained of general effect of Reforms-on functions and conditions of the Services. *It is most desirable that Commission if appointed should,.if possible, visit India before the end of this cold weather, and I shall be glad therefore if you will telegraph as early as possible whether you concur in appointment of Commission&apos;.I shall be glad therefore to have your observations on terms of reference, though these could.be sent by separate telegram to avoid delay.(     &apos;-&apos;    From, Viaeroy, 1,5th January 1923. I have considered in Council your telegram of the 21st ultimo. No. 4927, in which you intimate, conclusion reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government in favour of appointment of a Royal Commission on Services in India, and invite our concurrence.2. We assume at the outset that position indicated in your Despatch No. k3, dated 2nd November, and in several recent pronouncements in Parliament, holds good, viz.: that HisvMajesty&apos;s Government are resolved to  discountenance any attempt or any proceedings having a tendency. to anticipate statutory period for 6052     100  1.23
re-exam in ati on of the constitutional position. We. ourselves are opposed to any inquiry being now instituted which would lead: to&apos;re-examination of constitutional position, and we, therefore, feel constrained to point out that appointment of Royal Commission on terms proposed would, in our judgment, be likely seriously to disturb the present situation. In respect of constitutional advance, there is already, as you are aware, insistent demand in many quarters for acceleration of reforms; appointment of Royal Commission, even if limited to sole and separate question of condition of Services, and indeed the more so, because such limitation must stimulate&apos; this demand, but it is obvious that Committee could make no progress with enquiry into permanent and fundamental facts in constitution of Public Services without embarking on constitutional issues. Your predecessor, in his telegram of 7th January 1922,.No. 84, himself clearly recognised that the future, of the Services was closely connected1 with&apos;the whole development of Indian constitution towards self-government. The specific inclusion in the proposed terms referred to, &quot; of organisation of the Services-with reference to functions they should exercise,&quot; may be held: to raise these issues in a mure or less definite form. Consequences we apprehend are:  ... .&apos;-.(0 Revival of racial animosities and exacerbation of opinion towards all measures -for,relief of Services, including the proceedings of the Royal Commission -   itself. i  :..r. . &apos;(2) Increased unrest in Services owing to premature and necessarily unauthori-tative discussion of organic changes, regarding which they are particularly alarmed.(3) Alienation of perceptibly growing current, of public opinion more favourable to reasonable solution of Services problem on administrative and financial, rather than racial and political grounds.3, If question of constitutional changes is not explicitly excluded from reference to Commission, it seems inevitable that its members will be led to attempt provisional and speculative forecasts of future decisions in matters which would be unsound basis for practical recommendations, and would prejudice subsequent proceedings of the statutory Commission. If, on the other hand, as we think essential, such explicit exclusion is made, conclusions of Commission could only be of ad interim character with maximum period of validity up to 1930, and, therefore, in themselves little likely to afford solution of the problem regarding recruitment. Immediate problem affecting Europeans in Services, as we.see it,i is :-. I. To deal with situation arising from premature retirements. .11. To encourage and stimulate European recruitment.III. To secure maintenance of the strength, and efficiency of the Services during :       the period of transition, up to the date on which effect is given to resultsof statutory Commission. It will be impossible to deal comprehensively and effectively with all these objects on an entirely, provisional basis, and some decisions must be reached of -a more permanent character, so far as this is possible, without anticipating consti-tutional developments, immediate problem is to provide for above-mentioned period of transition, and we consider this can be clone more expeditiously and effectively by a committee of experts appointed by us in India, working mainly on the data already before us and under our direction, than by a Royal Commission.4. We have considered it necessary to set forth at some, length our objections to the particular expedient contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government. But we fully appreciate importance of the suggestions and considerations set forth in the concluding portion of the supplementary note to the McDonnell Committee Report, which has formed the basis of.your draft terms of reference to the proposed Commissions. The enquiry into increasing Indianisation you suggest can, in our view, be more expeditiousiy and efficiently dealt with by agency we propose, and with less political disturbance. We think that an exploration on ,the lines of this suggestion may, in effect, assist in the solution of some&apos;of the difficulties confronting the existing members of the Services in India. We fully recognise the gravity of the situation caused by large number of premature retirements and by present state and prospects of European recruitment, and the imperative necessity of prompt remedies to meet it. We are accordingly prepared to proceed forthwith i to examine and formulate proposals to provide such remedies. i -5. Following are specific points&apos;upon which representations-,have been made regarding the Services. We would propose examination of these with a view to the formulation of certain definite proposals.
(1) Complete separation of &quot;European and Indian recruitment,- ^on the lines that in future all Europeans should be recruited in England on European basis, and all Indians in India on Indian basis. w. ,(2) Recruitment of certain/technical Services, such as Agricultural Department; to be&apos; placed on a provincial basis without, prejudice to&apos; the interests of the existing&apos; members, any European recruitment required in these Services to be carried Out by flioii Commissioner as Agent,of Indian Government concerned.0 ($) As corollary, to (1) and (2) above, proportion of Europeans to be maintained in. -each. Service, to which appointments are made by Secretary of State, to be reviewed and fixed. &apos;      V / &quot;/ :- ;;i&apos;Vr!&apos;:&apos; ;&apos; &apos; &apos;v      -. &apos;       &apos;    ;.&apos; -(-1) Compensation on definite scale, in addition to gratuity/or pension nOw admissible for premature determination of an officers service, otherwise &apos; than-by 1 misconduct, inefficiency or invalidation. &apos;J(5) In the case of persons appointed by His Majesty or the Secretary of State, -existing statutory guarantees to be confirmed, and, where they are not now sufficiently -clear and specific, amended.(G) The grant to married officers recruited on a European basis as a substantial increment, with allowances for children, to the present scale of overseas pay, based mainly on high cost of living iri United Kingdom, but taking into account the rate of exchange. These increments to be liable to variation or withdrawal as result&quot; of -economic changes, on which they depend,. Question of admitting officers holding posts above time-scales to be considered.        .&apos;    * &quot;&quot; 1(7) Free passages at; reasonable intervals for European officers and their families. &apos; &quot;(8) Provision for medical attendance.  &apos;.G. In formulating their proposals after examination of.above, points, the Govern,-. , ment of India would be compelled to have due&apos;regard to the financial situation,,&apos;Jjij^,.. recognise that the matter cannot be determined on financial considerations alone.:7. If. notwithstanding the: above considerations, His Majesty&apos;s-Government decide to appoint a Royal Commission, we should be glad of an opportunity to comment further on the proposed terms of reference with the dangerous implications of which we have already dealt. In particular, we consider that all enquiry into constitutional -changes should be explicitly excluded, and that inclusion of the question of increasing the Indian element in the Services should be more definitely expressed. We should -desire to lay special emphasis on considerations mentioned in concluding paragraph -of supplementary note to McDonnell Committee.tS. Notice of most important resolutions opposing the appointment of a Royal Commission on the Services, without previously ascertaining the views of the Legislature, have been received in both Chambers, and similar resolutions have been passed by United Provinces, Chambers of Commerce, and other bodies.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 18th January 1923.251. Tour telegram of 15th January. I have carefully considered objections which you advance against proposal to appoint Royal Commission on the Services in India. I.wish to make it clear in the first place that there is no question of re-examining the constitutional position, and that, in my opinion, adequate safeguards can be devised to prevent any attempt in the direction, of anticipating the work of the statutory Commission. The considerations which I have felt bound to impress on His Majesty&apos;s Government are these. Difficulty of securing European recruits is, as you are aware, a matter of grave and immediate concern, and is clearly due not merely to reports of existing grievances, but even more to uncertainty of future prospects.. Unless problem is taken in hand now on as comprehensive basis as possible, there is imminent risk that situation will be created shortly which will seriously impair the administrative machinery of India &apos;hereaftef and will thereby endanger prospects of future political development. We cannot afford to await a breakdown. But if we are to take the problem in hand, it is essential that we should frame some outline of the career which we can offer to recruits of the type we must secure.On this basis a reconsideration of the position and functions of the Services can properly be regarded as an inevitable concomitant of the Reforms as now established. Indeed, such an enquiry should logically.have proceeded hand in hand with the parallel enquiries on which the Act of 1919 was based, were it not for the obvious fact that at that time the necessary data had not been elicited by working experience. The enquiry, in fact, should be linked as a, complement to those which preceded the inauguration of Reforms,
In such an enquiry the remedying of existing grievances cannot take the leading-part. The main question will he the functions of, the European element in the Services.     . , . . v flConsideration of improvements in the conditions of. service of that element will of course, be an integral part of the enquiry, but h. can only be made effective by determining at the same time the spheres in which the. element is really essential and to which it should be restricted. Any method of effecting restriction by aceeJ.erati.ao the process .of indianisation within the: Services ,as. they, now exist is manifestly undesirable. The right alternative- appears to be,,.to.,effect It by devolution to specifically Indian Services by methods to be ascertained by full investigation.I cannot convince myself that anything short of an enquiry in this direction will meet the true needs of the case, or that enquiry can satisfactorily be conducted by any body of less authority than a Royal Commission. Even apart from these considerations it must be realised that a vital, factor is the1 state of public, opinion in this country which reacts directly upon the field of, British recruitment, aud that that opinion as-expressed in Parliament would not be satisfied by an expert enquiry of the limited scope that you suggest.. .- .     Si; -.. In maintaining my previous conclusion, I have given.full weight to the arguments-adduced by-Your Excellency -s Covei-nment, but I do not find that they counterbalance the disadvantages, and; indeed the risk of any alternative&apos;procedure. In particular, 1 do not&apos; contemplate&apos;the findings of a Royal Commission need only be of ad interim character with maximum period . of validity up- to 1930.: -I contemplate rather that [ Royal Commission will be able to, lay ;!do\vn; general -lines, on-which further developments will be possible&quot;hereafter, and that this can safely be done in the light, of experience already acquired without in any,way trenching on settled questions of constitutional relations, and without any need for bringing these under examination save as governing factors-of the case11 Under enquiry. J think it desirable, however, to emphasise. that in my view an&apos;adequate solution of the urgent problem of the Services will be found &apos;to be an essential condition of further constitutional progress.i I have decided, therefore, to proceed - with the recommendation&quot; to; appoint a Royal Commission. I shall be glad to receive-1 as early as possible your further views on the Terms of Reference, and I will carefully consider any suggestions you desire to make with a view to excluding enquiry&apos;into:constitutional changes.
