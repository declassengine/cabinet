It has since been discussed in detail with the representatives of the various interests concerned and has been amended in some respects.   The Bill can now be regarded aa practically non-controversial,I am anxious that this Bill should be re-introduced early next   Session for it has been under consideration for so long that unless it is passed this year a strong volume of protest must be expected from all parties interested in the salmon and freshwater fisheries.R.
