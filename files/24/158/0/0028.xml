(This Document isihe Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet. . January 1923.SECRET.CP. 28 (23).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 83.    Period ended January 12, 1923.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 8th January was 1,473,419, a decrease of 12,459 on the previous week.COAL-MINING.Depression exists in the Somerset coalfields, and the improvement previously recorded in the Forest of Dean has not been maintained. Employment is normal in the Midlands and continues steady in the Yorkshire and Durham coalfields. The situation in Lancashire continues to improve and prospects are good. In Scotland, the position is unsatisfactory at some centres, but much better at others. In the Welsh coalfields employment has been irregular. It is reported that there is an increasing demand for British coal from France, Italy and Germany, but the effect of this increase was not felt during the period under review.IRON AND STEEL.There has been no change in the Midlands. In Northumberland, Durham and Yorkshire, the pre-holiday improvement has not been maintained, but slow and steady progress continues. There are signs of further activity in Wales, and the improvement in Cumberland and Lancashire continues. In Scotland, the expected improvement has not materialised.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The situation in the South-Western Counties is still below normal, but a gradual improvement is manifest. The improvement on the Tyne and Tees continues. Orders have been received on the Mersey and at Barrow, and at least some temporary improvement is expected. On the Clyde, prospects are hopeful, but the absorption of workmen is being retarded at one centre by a trade dispute-There are signs of improvement at certain of the Welsh ports, but on the whole there is no great activity.ENGINEERING.Although slackness is still the rule, improvements have either been realised or are expected at some centres. The improvement in the motor and textile sections continues.TEXTILES.Cotton. There has been a revival of activity which may only be temporary  in Yorkshire.   In Lancashire, production is still curtailed.Hosiery, Woollen and Worsted. Trade in the Midlands and Scotland remains normal. In the West Riding of Yorkshire, there is still no improvement to record and none is expected for some time.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.
Silk. Weaving is good at Coventry, but trade at Leek is slack.Lace. In the Midlands, depression exists in all branches except the curtain section, which is fairly well employed.Jute. The present state of this industry, though poor, indicates some improvement on the position six months ago.BUILDING.The volume of unemployment continues to be abnormal and the position generally is quiet, although at certain places some activity is evident.BOOT AND SHOE.The situation in the London area is on the decline and depression is the rule in the South-Western Counties. In the Midlands, unemployment continues to be abnormal and at Northampton particularly trade is slack. While the position at Leicester and Kettering is not very bright, employment is good at Bromsgrove and Wolverhampton.   In Scotland, employment is scarce.CLOTHING.Seasonal depression exists in most places, but at some centres activity is evident.POTTERY AND GLASS.While severe unemployment continues in the pottery industry, there are prospects of an improvement in the early Spring consequent upon a revision of wages and prices.   In Yorkshire, the glass bottle trade does not show any improvement.TINPLATE.Employment in this industry remains good.TRANSPORT.There has been a temporary improvement at the London and Avonmouth Docks, but on the Tyne and Tees there is still a general surplus of dock labour due to a decrease in timber cargoes. A steady improvement is anticipated in the Liverpool district. There is little change to report in the position at the Scottish Docks or in Wales.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN. [From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods oi benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and impoped^a special levy to provide for these grants.  The Unemployment Insurance Act, (1922,
which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot;&apos; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow monev from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 6th January, 1923. 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 121,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(G.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.[9389] p. 3
In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes assisted last year. All applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils. (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16,. 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are &apos;shown below (see table 6). County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications may be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Eural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 30tb November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government will be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ...        ... ...        ...       600,000Land Drainage ... ...    &apos;   ...        ...        ...        170,000Afforestation ... ...        ...        ...        ... ...        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works......... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000 --     1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.! On the 12th December,. 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the home Office would puE in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to the effect that forestry grants are now available for the relief of unemployment on the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The sum set aside for this purpose is, as stated above,  100,000.By the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act, 1922 (Session 2), enacted on the 15th December, 1922, formal sanction was given for the increase of the aggregate -capital amount of loans the principal or interest of which mav be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.
