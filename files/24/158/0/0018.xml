Goddess (Washington).januaryy 14th, 1923.D.    6.55.a,m. January 15th, 1923.IR.l,0O.p.m. January 15th, 1923.No.19.(R).URGENT.Following for Prime Minister from Chancellor of exchequer:My telegram No. 14;Immediately on receipt of your telegram I had confidential conversation with chairman of commission whom I am persuaded is not only anxious for immediate settlement but is genuinely friendly to Great Britain but whose position is such as to preclude separate negotiations with me.As a result I offered at this afternoon&apos;s meeting that if commission would agree to recommend to President and to present congress a settlement on basis of % interest plus half per cent sinking fund I would ask that matter should be considered at a full cabinet. I indicated that if commission agree to make such a recommendation I should have proposals to make on certain minor points on which, however, I did not doubt that it would be possible to reach satisfactory agree-ment.We then withdrew from the meeting in order that commission might discuss this suggestion.   We metagain
1 ?ii tj 1&quot;be too late to get any alteration of funding act through present congress which will be adjourned on March 4th. and next congress will probably not meet again till December.    In the meantime public opinion which has moved in our favour partly because of recent action of France,partly because American public has come to believe we mean to pay, will have swung back and in new and evenly balanced congress it is (? gr. oratd.) that question of our debt would be debated in bitterly partisan spirit.    No reasonable settlement could then be expected until after next presidential election and how that will go no one can say except that it will not mark return to policies of Mr. Wilson. In absence of settlement British debt would inevitably become undesirably prominent issue in election.We feel very strongly that a settlement is well nigh essential and that without it we cannot expect im-provernent in general financial conditions.    Any such improvement will presumably be preceded by a general economic conference and at this it is vital that we should not have to take a place amongst the ranks of defaulters.Issue then is whether settlement now proposed as is so burdensome as to outweigh all these disadvantages. In my opinion it is not.    I have little doubt that Great Britain would not regard 33 million sterling yearly as being too high a price to pay to escapeappearing
appearing as a defaulter.    This is annual payment for first ten years and it ought to be within our powers. The increase of 5 millions sterling in ten years time is comparatively small and we have time to provide against it.    Further much may happen in ten years. What is quite certain is that if we fail to settle now not only American opinion but world opinion will questloi our willingness to pay with serious damage to our pres-tige.All of us who are working here are convinced of necessity of settlement and I urge cabinet to accept.It appears to me in- all circumstances that honestygoand expediency for once/hand in hand and I gravely fear lest by trying for shadow we lose the bone.
