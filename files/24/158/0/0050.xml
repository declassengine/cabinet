DOCUIOTT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.COPY NO,C A B I N E T.(23).RATING AND VALUATION BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.1.     I refer to the report of She Rating Reform Committee CP.27 (23).2.     It is proposed to embody in the Rating and Valuation Bill provision for the additional rating relief to agriculture in England.     This proposal, if adopted, necessarily involves a separate measure to give a like additional relief in Scotland.3,     I have considered whether the Scottish Bill could be .confined to this limited purpose, and I an satisfied that it will be necessary not only to alter the basis on which the agricultural rating relief is distributed, but also to make provision for the removal of certain specific rating grievances, and for the simplification of the rating system.4.     At present the agricultural rating relief in Scotland is confined to the occupiers&apos; rates, and, as rates in Scotland are, generally speaking, imposed half on owner and half on occupier, the relief which agriculture as an industry receives is very considerably less than that enjoyed by agriculture in England.     This, I think, must be remedied.5.     Rating for education expenditure was left in a most anomalous state by the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, and the demand for a readjustment as regards this rate has been widespread and weighty.In addition, a recent Departmental Committee on Local Taxation in Scotland (presided over by Lord Dunedin) has reported, and it would, I feel, be very difficult to pass a neasure dealing with rating in Scotland unless it included the main recommendations of that Committee.   The Bill would therefore contain provisions dealing with the matters mentioned in this paragraph.6.     I may add that the English Bill could not be . spiled to Scotland.NOVAR.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,26th January, 1923.
