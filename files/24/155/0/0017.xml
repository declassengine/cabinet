FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ALBANIA.Recognition of the Government [F.C.R., lvi, p. 2]. On 17tliNovember Mr. Kennard reported [No. 475] from Rome that, the Italian Government bad recognized the Albanian Government and had so informed them.Frontiers. Lord Hardinge sent the following telegram [No. 890] from Paris on 1.8th November : On examination it has been found that the absence of correct maps and the lack of information regarding local conditions render it impossible to define at the present time, in a satisfactory manner, the frontiers of Albania as fixed by the conference of Ambassadors on 9th November.In these circumstances the conference feels that the only way to avoid collision between Jugo-Slavs and Albanians, and continual disputes with regard to the frontier line pending its definite delimitation by the boundary commission, is to establish provisionally a neutral zoiiebetween Jugo-Slavia and Albania. It is clearly understood that in fixing this neutral zone the conference is in no way prejudicing the ultimate decision of the boundary commission which is to delimit the frontier. Such a neutral zone has accordingly been defined, as far as it is possible to do so with the maps at the disposal of the conference. It is being communicated to-day to the Jugo-Slav and Albanian Governments with the request that they will withdraw their troops from it before the .10th December. This decision of the conference is likewise being communicated to the council of the League, who will be able to consider it at their meeting to-morrow.The conference is convinced that it is essential that the boundary commission -which is eventually to delimit the frontier should proceed at once to Albania, even though it may not be able, on account of the lateness of the season, to begin its work. It is felt that there are almost sure to be disputes with regard to the limits of the neutral zone, and it is most desirable that there should be an allied body on the spot, preferably at Scutari, able to give a decision at once in the case of such disputes, and to introduce modifications in the lines as drawn here where they are found to be impracticable. In fact the conference has suggested to the League of Nations that if the commission of enquiry which the League is sending to Albania has reason to believe that the neutral zone is being violated, it should in the first place consult the boundary commission on the subject. It is essential, therefore, that the boundary commission should be constituted as soon as possible, and I trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able very shortly to nominate their delegate and instruct him to be ready to proceed to Albania without delay.ARMENIA.Refugees. Lord Alleuby telegraphed [No. 644] as follows from Cairo on 26th November:-The Armenian patriarch here called upon me on 25th November to inform me that numerous Armenian refugees from Cilicia were expected in Egypt in the course of the next month or so, and to request the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government in making arrangements for their reception, as the funds at the disposal of the Armenian community here were quite inadequate to cope with the influx, which the patriarch anticipated might eventually amount to many thousands of refugees. I informed him that it was quite impossible for me to agree, to any such refugees being admitted to Egypt, and that instructions had been given to the port authorities to prevent their landing.The patriarch enquired whether I had any alternative suggestion as to how the situation should be dealt with. I replied that I had none, beyond advising him to refer to the French High Commissioner in Syria, who was responsible for the arrangements in connection with the evacuation of Cilicia.
BELGIUM,Remits of the Election. On 25th November Sir George Graham e reported [No. 183] from Brussels that the final results of the election for the chamber showed a gain of nine seats for the catholic party ; a loss of one for the liberals, and of four for the socialists. Several small groups had. lost seats. The respective strengths of catholics, socialists and liberals in the new chamber would be 82, 66 and 33. The catholic success and the liberal failure were equally unexpected. The catholic party was politically homogeneous only in name.. CHINA.Tariff [EC. 11., IV, p. 3, The Washington Conference]. On 19th November .Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed [No. 427] as follows from Peking: In an identic note of 18th November the Minister for Foreign Affairs states that the Chinese Government, pending unanimity on the part of foreign Powers&apos;to consent to a revision of the tariff, propose to increase the present tariff rates by a surtax of 25 per cent. The note points out that the tariff will still not represent a full 5 per cent.The additional revenue anticipated from the above surtax is to be employed for the issue of a public loan of 350,000,000, of which $20,000,000 is to be for the service of foreign debts and $30,000,000 for the service of internal debts. A speedy -answer is requested in order that the surtax may be put into force immediately. No mention is made of any form of control.The matter will lie considered, by the corps diplomatique.Resolution of the British Chamber of Commerce.  On 24th November Sir Beilby Alston transmitted [No. 432] the following text of a resolution, passed unanimously at a meeting of the British chamber of commerce in China and Plong Kong on 3rd November, at the request and expense of the associated chamber of commerce in China and Hong Kong : (? Groups omitted) consisting of representatives of British banks, shipping and insurance companies, manufacturers and merchants, whoj by reason of their (? wide-spread) business interests and (? considerable) capital invested in this country, are deeply concerned with the commercial and industrial development of China and the preservation of her national independence and territorial integrity, desires to place on record its conviction that the cause of China will not be advanced, and may, indeed, be prejudiced, if, as is reported on good authority they intend to do, the Chinese delegation to the Washington conference put forward far-reaching demands for the abolition of extra-territoriality, tariff autonomy, cancellation of existing agreements regarding railways, mines, &amp;c, which are not justified in view of the present inability of the Chinese Government to maintain order in the country, to protect the lives and property of foreigners, to establish courts of law where justice shall be freely and impartially administered, and to devote the revenue accruing from the taxation of trade to the development of the country&apos;s resources.That this conference is of opinion that the time has come when China should frankly recognize that foreign assistance is essential in order that her national finance and currency may be placed on a sound basis, her railways maintained and developed on modern lines, and her judicial system reformed so as to bring it into accord with that of. western nations, and that she would be well advised to accept the proposals which the Powers taking part in the conference may make for the attainment of these objects.The Washington Conference. On 21st November Mr. Balfour reported [No. 47] that at a meeting of the Far East and Pacific committee the following resolution Avas adopted:  .It is the- firm intention of the Powers hereinafter mentioned attending the -conference, to wit, America, Belgium, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Portugal:  (1) To respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial and administrative integrity of China.(2) To provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China to -develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government.
(3) To use their influence for the purpose of effectually establishing and main-taining the principle of equal opportunity, commercial and industrial, of all nations throughout the territory of China.(4) To refrain from taking advantage of present conditions in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly states, and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such states.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Relations with Hungary. Sir George Clerk telegraphed [No. 1.67] as follows from Prague on 28th November:  I have to-day received a note from the Prime Minister informing me of recent incursions of Hungarian armed bands into Czecho-Slovak territory, the most serious of which, took place on the ItJth instant, when&apos; Hungarian gendarmes and armed civilians crossed the frontier at Gestete, killing two Czech gendarmes and taking-four others prisoner. The Czecho-Slovak Government has informed the conference&apos; of Ambassadors of the incident and demanded satisfaction from the Hungarian Government.On.23rd and 24th November Hungarian regular soldiers occupied four villages which are either in Czecho-Slovak territory or in the hands of Czechs pending the decision of the boundary commission.The Prime Minister points out that the &quot; strange and dangerous &quot; attitude of the: Magyar commandant synchronized with the demobilization and. withdrawal of Czech troops from the frontier. Sufficient Czech forces have now been reconcentrated, but have been given orders to avoid contact with the Magyars.The Prime Minister has requested the conference of Ambassadors to instruct the-inter-allied commission, to intervene and the boundary commission to hasten its decisions regarding the disputed areas.FINLAND.The German Minister. - Mr. Ronnie telegraphed [No. 172] as follows from Helsingfors on 28th November: The new German Minister, accompanied by all his staff, assisted at two lectures delivered here on 24th and. 25th November by a German lady propagandist of American origin, representing the, Hearst press and Bolshevik interests. The lecturer grossly insulted the allied forces on the Rhine and in Upper Silesia, her statements being vigorously applauded by the German Minister and personnel. After the first lecture the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed himself to the German Minister, and asked him to request the lady to abstain from language insulting to the Allies. The German-Minister declined. The allied representatives at Helsingfors, who have always hitherto maintained correct relations with the German representatives, now see-themselves unfortunately compelled to suspend their relations with the present German Minister at Holsingfors. The British, Italian, Polish and Rumanian Ministers and the French Charge d&apos;Affaires have decided to send this identic telegram to their Governments, requesting approval of this attitude, and asking that the matter may be brought to the notice of the German Government.Telegraphing [No. 173] again on the same day Mr. Rennie said that the Finnish Government had been placed in an awkward, situation. After the first lecture, the-Minister for Foreign Affairs received a promise from a member of the German legation that the lecturer should be asked to refrain from remarks offensive to friendly countries. The German Minister, however, seems to have deliberately&quot;abstained from, giving effect to the promise. He understood from the Minister for Foreign Affairs , that he would now make a representation at Berlin, calling attention to the attitude of the German Minister.Mr. Ronnie added that he and his colleagues wished to do nothing further-to embarrass the Finnish Government or in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs; They had, therefore, in an identic telegram to their respective Governments, confined themselves to a protest against the proceedings of the German Minister in his capacity as a member of the corps diplomatique. Ills behaviour could hardly suit his Government at the present juncture. He presented his credentials only a week ago.   The lady&apos;s name was Mrs. Ray Beveridge.Aland Islands. See &quot; Russia &quot; and &quot; Sweden.&quot;
HUNGARY.Suggested Mission, to London. On 17th November Mr. Hohler, telegraphing [No. 448] from Budapest, recommended to Lord Curzon&apos;s favourable consideration a proposal made by the Hungarian Government to send Count Csaky on a special mission to London to lay before his Lordship an authoritative expose of. the views of the Hungarian Government on the present political situation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attached special importance to this as the Government desired their future action to be framed on lines which would meet with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos; ITALY.Relations with the Angora Government. Telegraphing [No. 759] from Cohstanti-nople on 28th November, Sir Horace Rumbold reported that the Italian High Commissioner has stated in an interview now published that: In general politics Italy constitutes with England and France an indivisible whole. Therefore, whilst she desires to re-establish peace, there can be no question of her attempting to work to this end in isolation. As for deliberations at present taking place in Angora, 1 can affirm that my country is not now in a state of war with any other, and as she is not affected like France by questions of Syria and Silesia, she has no need to conclude either a treaty or convention with Angora.And that the High Commissioner went on to explaiu that these negotiations were not intended to effect a verbal settlement with certain allies at Zongulak Adet, and reasserted that they had no political character.JAPAN.A Regent. On 25th November Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 4G9] from Tokio that an imperial decree had been published that day announcing the appointment of the Crown Prince as regent.Manceuvres. This telegram [No. 464] was sent from Tokio by Sir Charles Eliot on 23rd November : -The manoeuvres held in the neighbourhood of Tokio terminated yesterday in&apos;a grand review. General Kirkpafrick, who attended them, informs me that he (? considers) that (? their) object was spectacular and (? ceremonial) rather than military, and that they succeeded iu arousing the enthusiasm of the population.I think it very probable that the military authorities wished to bring the Crown Prince prominently before the army as its future chief and to create an interest in. the troops which will render (? public) (? group omitted) opposed to the reduction of the land forces.PERSIA.Oil Concessions in North, Persia. Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 627] on 14th November that he had been informed that the Persian Charge d&apos;Affaires at Constantinople had interested an American &quot; admiral&apos;: there in Persian oilfields. The Persian Government had then been approached by these two through the German Charge d&apos;Affaires at Teheran. The latter, on being informed by the Persian Government that the North Persian oilfields had been purchased by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, was said to have offered to repay whatever this &quot;company had paid.In the course of conversation with Mr. Bridgeman the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires had remarked that the fact of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company having paid a considerable amount in respect of the Khostaria concession need not by itself present any obstacle to the surrender of the company&apos;s claim, because any American group wishing to acquire it would be prepared to repay any sum already paid for so. important a concession.Referring to the above message, Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 642] oil 19th November that the Prime Minister had stated in the Medjliss that the Persian Government did not recognize the Khostaria concession as lawful, and considered it void, inasmuch as the Medjliss had never ratified it. The party concerned had been notified accordingly.34-5 B
Qn 22nd November Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 648] that the President of the Council had that day asked the Medjliss to grant a concession to the Standard Oil Company for exploitation of the oilfields in Azerbaijan, Gilan, Astrabad, Mazanderan and Khorassan.   The Medjliss had approved after a short debate.The terms of this concession were given in a telegram [No. 651] dated 24th November. They were to the effect that the Standard Oil Company has the right to extract oil in the provinces named for a period of 50 years, the Persian Government being entitled to dues of more than 10 per cent, of all oil and bye-products extracted. Other conditions, regulating financial arrangements and govern-in en tal supervision, and invalidation clauses had not yet been determined, and would be submitted to the Medjliss at a later dale. The company would not have the right of transfer to any foreign Government or association.Mr. Bridgeman had called the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the views which His Majesty&apos;s Government might be expected to eutertain regarding this fresh concession. The Minister had replied by repeating the arguments as to the invalidity of the Khostaria concession.Mr. Bridgeman had been informed that the Russian legation had made an official protest against the grant of the concession, on the grounds that until ratification of the Russo-Persian treaty had taken place the concession remained Russian property. After ratification, the Persian Government would be bound by its engagement not to grant to the subjects of a third Power a concession which the Russian Government had renounced.Telegraphing [No. 655] on 25th November Mr. Bridgeman reported that the French Charge d&apos;Affaires had informed him that on bis own initiative he had protested to the Prime Minister against the grant of the concession without previous notification to the French Government. He had based his protest on the fact that, in accordance with instructions from the French Government, an immediate cash advance had been offered to the Persian Government for the granting of an oil concession in North Persia to the Societe Francaise.Mr. Bridgeman had himself addressed an official protest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting under the directions received from Lord Curzon.:   - -1 &apos;V:,i; . i V&apos;Financial Difficulties. Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 640] on 18th November that the President of the Council was much depressed at the refusal of the British Government to help Persia with money. He appeared to have been equally unsuccessful so far in raising money from other countries, and was contemplating resignation if help was not forthcoming.Referring to the above, Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 658] on 27th November the receipt of a message from the Prime Minister, saying he was at his wits&apos; end for money, and enquiring the conditions on which opposition to borrowing from the Imperial. Bank of Persia could be removed. Colonel Grey, through whom the message was sent, had remarked to the Prime Minister that the present moment was somewhat inopportune for an appeal for British assistance in view of the action of the Persian Government regarding the oil concession in North Persia and the British protest against it. The Prime Minister had reiterated the views of the Persian Government regarding the Khostaria concession, but had admitted that it would have been better to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government before surrendering it to the Americans.Mr. Bridgeman understood that the American company had paid no money down, and that there was no immediate prospect of any payment being made. The Prime Minister had declared that, failing money, the country would have to be abandoned to the soldiery, who were crying out for their pay. Instructions for-bidding the payment of money for administrative purposes to any government department had already been issued by the Minister of War, who had also seized the municipalities funds.Relations with Russia. On 28th November Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 659] the following : On 23rd November the Russian Minister addressed two notes to the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   The text of the first is as follows  &quot; By clause 24 of the Russo-Persian treaty ratification must take place within three months of signature.&quot;This period expired on the 26th May, and from the legal point of view the treaty has. become invalid. Therefore any measure which may have been taken by the Persian Government as regards the appropriation of institutes belonging !o the former
Russian Government (group undecyplierable) subjects and failure to pay the instalments of loans advanced by the former Russian Government are entirelyillegal.k &quot;Five months have elapsed since the period fixed for ratification, during which time neither parliament nor competent government authorities have taken any steps for the ratification of the treaty. This disregard, even disrespect, with regard to the treaty of February last, for the conclusion of which a special mission was despatched to Moscow, may be interpreted as unwillingness on the part of the Persian Govern-ment and the Medjliss to ratify. There remains, therefore, no alternative for my Government except to relieve the Persian Government of the unpleasant duty of pronouncing the treaty invalid.&quot; In consideration of the foregoing I respectfully state that so long as the treaty is not ratified, and the obligations undertaken thereunder by the Persian Government are not carried out, I do not approve of any measure of the Persian Government based on the signature of the said treaty, and I consider it my duty to inform you that if the treaty be.not ratified as soon as possible I shall he obliged to refer to my Government for instructions as regards the future situation of the treaty.&quot;The text of the second note is as follows: &quot;1 have learnt from the newspapers that the Persian Government has submitted a proposal to the Medjliss for the concession of the North Persian oil wells, which up to the present belonged to Russian subjects, and has asked for its immediate ratification by parliament. Parliament ratified it immediately. As the Russo-Persian treaty has not yet been ratified, this action of the Persian Government and the Medjliss is an illegal infraction of the concession in question. Since clause 13 of the above-mentioned treaty precludes the giant to subjects of a third Power of the concession restored to Persia, even after ratification of the treaty, such measures on the part of the Persian Government and the Medjliss.would be illegal. I therefore consider it necessary to acquaint your Excellency that if the Persian Government and the Medjliss do not desist from steps which trample ou the rights of the Russian Government, and the most important conditions of the agreement, I shall notify you of the consequences of such an attitude.&quot;The state of public opinion is such that it looks as if the fate of the Anglo-Persian agreement may overtake the Russo-Persian. The fear of Russia existing here a year ago has much diminished.POLAND.The Political Situation-Mr. Max Muller reported [No. 440] as follows from Warsaw on 17thNovember :-The diet yesterday, after a stormy debate lasting two days, adopted by 171 votes to 158 with 100 abstentions the proposal of the Government for including the districta-of Lida and Braclaw in the area in which the elections for the Vilna diet are to be held.The grave clanger of a fresh Government crisis and also of the resignation of the President has thus been avoided, but only by the narrow margin of 13 ; and I was surprised to find the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon expressing himself as entirely satisfied with the result.(?Tie) told&apos; me that preparations would now be made for elections throughout the larger (? group omitted), but he did not think that they could be held before some date in January. The actual date would be announced by General Zeligowski, who would then leave Vilna.RUSSIA.The- Aland islands. The following wireless message was despatched from Moscow by M. Chicherin on 13th November: Le Gouvernement russe a appris avec etonnement par Pintermediare de la presse occidentale quune convention avait ete signee le 20 octobre a Geneve relativement a la situation juridique des iles cPAland. Des le 2 octobre 1919 le Gouvernement russe declarait aux puissances de 1&apos;Entente ainsi que la Suede et a la Finlande quo le sort des iles cPAland ne pourrait, selon lui, etre regalement fixe sans la participation de la Russie. Le Gouvernement russe ajoutait une protestation energique contre Pintention des puissances de PEntente tFusurperune autorite qui ne leur appartient pas et de 34-5 C
disposer de territoires en dehors efc a 1&apos;insu de la volonte des nations et des masses laborieuses interessees. Le 28 juin 1920 le Gouverneniont russe declarait eucore vine fois qhaucune decision des puissances ou de qaelque groupement que ce soit a l&apos;cgard des lies d&apos;Aland ne serait reconnue valable par lui si il n&apos;avait ete participant aux transactions eorrespondautes. Depuis lors le Gouvernement russe ayant reconnu les iles d&apos;Aland com me faisant partie de la republique de Finlande exprima a inaiutes reprises le point de vue qu&apos;aucun changement dans la situation juridique de ces lies ne pent avoir lieu sans son concours. Le 22 juillet le Gouveme-inent russe adressait aux Gouvernements de la Suede et de la Finlande une protesta-tion relative a 1&apos;intention du Gouvernement suedois de convoquer un congres pour la neutralisation des iles d.&apos;Aland, indiquant que si une solution nouvelle etait envisagee, quant a la situation juridique de ces iles, le droit de la Russie ehtra.it immecliatement en jeu et aucune decision sur letir status international ne pouvait etre adoptee de droit sans la participation de la Russie. Le Gouvernemeut russe declare en con-sequence toute decision des puissances allectant la situation juridique des iles d&apos;Aland adoptee en dehors et a 1&apos;insu de la Russie et par consequent les stipulations de la convention du 20 octobre ne peuvent etre considerees par lui comme ayant force legalc. Le Gouvernemeut russe ne recommit aucune des decisions formulees dans cette convention, declare n&apos;etre aucunement lie par elles et tirera le cas echeant de cette constatation toutes les consequences qu&apos;il pourra considerer connne oppor-tunes. Ni les stipulations relatives a certaiues limitations cle droits dans la zone cles iles dAlaud, ni celles qui coucerneut les exceptions a ces limitations, ne peuvent etre admises par le Gouvernement russe comme ayaut force legale. Le Gouvernement russe proteste en particulier contre 1&apos;attribution a une societe cle nations qui il. ne connait point de fractions juridiques embrassant la zone des iles cVAland. En sa qualite de puissance riveraiue cle la mer BaLique, la Russie se considere comme particulierement affectee par tout aCte cle tierces (sic) puissances visant la situation juridique des iles cPAlaucl et declare encore une fois que vu 1&apos;interet special que ces iles presentent pour les classes laborieuses de Russie a cause de leur situation geographique le Gonvernement cles Soviets qui represents la volonte de ces masses considere de son devoir inprescriptible de ne pas admettre cle changement clans la situation juridique des iles d&apos;Alancl en dehors de sa volonte. II croit pouvoir constater en pleine connaissance cle cause que des decisions de ce genre prises sans le Russie manqueront totalement cle stabilite. Le (louvornement russe n&apos;entre nieme pas en discussion sur 1&apos;eventualite d&apos;une accession ulterieure a cles decisions prises par cTautres contractants et declare la convention du 20 octobre purement et simplement inexlstahte pour la Russie. Le Gouvernement russe se croit en droit d&apos;exprimer un etonuement tout particulier que le Gouvernement britannique, qui est attache a la Russie par les relations cle fait et par des conventions reciproques Comportant cles obligations mutuelles d&apos;attitude amicale, ait era pouvoir participer a une convention internationale qui reclamait obligatoirement la presence de la Russie sans se preoccuper cles droits essentiels et cles interets primordiaux cle cette derniere, violes du fait cle sa iron participation attitude cle la part du Gouvernement britannique qui constitue inclubitablenrent un acte clinamitie envers la Russie.On 16th November Mr. Barclay reported [No. 171] from Stockholm that M. Kersjentsev had presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a note signed by M. Chicherin protesting against the Geneva convention of 20th October respecting the Aland Islands.The note expressed particular astonishment that the Swedish Government, which was bound to Russia by de facto relations and reciprocal conventions involving mutual undertakings to preserve a friendly attitude, should have taken part in an inter-national convention which necessarily required the presence of Russia, not taking into account Russia&apos;s fundamental rights and primary interests. The note considers that the participation of Sweden in such circumstances involves hostile action against, Russia.On the following day Mr. Rennie also reported [No. 159] from Helsingfors that M. Tchernykh had presented a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting against the Geneva convention.The note stated that Russia refused to recognize the legal force of the convention regarding the Aland Islands drawn up without her being consulted, nor would she tolerate any change made without her consent in the judicial status of the Aland Islands.
Surprise was expressed that Finland, hound&apos; to Russia by ties of peace and friendship, should, have partaken in a convention in which Russia had an absolute right to share, without considering Russians vital interests, which had been ignored.The note added that such procedure on the part of Finland was undoubtedly an act hostile to Russia.[See &quot;Sweden.&quot;]SERBIA.Demobilization of Reservists.- On 19th November Sir Alban Young telegraphed [No. 271] from Belgrade that the military attache had been informed officially that all reservists on the Albanian frontier had been sent home, and that the dispositions on the Hungarian front had returned to their normal peace state.Rumania and Serbian Policy.- On 1.7th November Sir Alban Young reported &apos;[No. 269] that the Rumanian Government had sent, through their Minister in Belgrade, a message to M. Pasitch, urging him, in the interests of peace, to comply with the wishes of the Powers, and adding that the Little Entente was already unpopular. M. Pasitch had replied that he had informed the conference that as soon as the Serbian frontier had been sufficiently traced the Serbian troops would retire behind it. Sir Alban added that the same statement had already been made to. the French Charge d&apos;Alfaires, in course of conversation with whom M. Pasitch had also affirmed that there were no irregular Serbian forces fighting with the Mirdites.SILESIA.Hie Frontiers. On 25th November General Sir W. Heneker transmitted [No. 383] from Oppeln the following translation of a telegram addressed by the commission of government to the conference of Ambassadors on 22nd November : The commission of government has taken note of the report of 1.9th November, addressed by General DupouLto the conference of Ambassadors, regarding the method of working adopted by the boundary sub-commission in Upper Silesia.This body proposes that the frontier to be traced by it on the map should be materialized on the ground by the commission of government.lire inter-allied commission is unanimously of opinion that its duty is to inform the conference of Ambassadors that it cannot undertake either the cost or the responsibility for this work. On the one hand, as a matter of fact, it has not sufficient allied personnel to supervi se the installation of notice boards, x^cave and barriers. On the other hand it does feel it cannot substitute itself for the.boundary sub-commission on which both German and Polish interests are represented. Any boundary operations carried out under its supervision would certainly be regarded with suspicion by the two interested parties who would be excluded because the territorial situation on one side or the other had not yet become subject to their administration.On the other hand the commission of government is prepared to facilitate in every way possible the work of the sub-commission by providing such personnel and material as it may require.Silesians detained in Germany and Poland. On 25th November Lord Hardinge telegraphed [No. 903] from Paris regarding the Silesians detained in Poland and Germany, saying that the conference of Ambassadors had decided that delegates to be appointed by the allied representatives should hold an enquiry in regard to them. This was in answer to representations made by the allied representatives in Berlin and Warsaw.SWEDEN.The Aland Islands-llw Barclay reported [No. 173] from Stockholm on 19th November that an official communique stated that the Swedish Government had. decided to ratify the Aland Islands convention. He added that he had heard thai the ratification would be deposited in Geneva in the first clays of December.[See &quot; Russia.&quot;]TURKEY.Italy and the Angora Government.
