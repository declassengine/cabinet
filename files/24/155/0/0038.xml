AUSTRIA.The Situation-Telegraphing from Rome on 7th September, Mr. Kennarcl reported as follows : The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me very seriously about the situation of Austria to-day, and urged that His Majesty&apos;s Government should reconsider her attitude of disinterestedness in this question, in which the peace of Europe was involved. As union with Germany was impossible, and Italy would not tolerate confederation, the only alternative was to keep Austria on its legs.A loan of 15,000,0001. would suffice for this purpose, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would only have to guarantee a third of this.A commission of control would be necessary to superintend the expenditure and the balancing of the budget. Italy must insist on securing the presidency of this commission, and might even go so far as to accept a mandate for Austria if offered to her. She (? group omitted) no territorial ambition in connexion with Austria, and only desired to keep the peace and avoid the possibility of Bolshevik revolution. It was impossible to secure the satisfactory co-operation of France, and he therefore hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would lend her moral and material support to any satisfactory proposal which might be made for saving Austria from dissolution.Seventy million lire are being advanced in two instalments this month, and negotiations for a commercial treaty with Austria are now proceeding.CHINA.Negotiations with Tibet.-On 15th September Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed from Peking as follows: I enquired verbally from the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 13th September whether the Chinese Government were now prepared to fulfil the assurance given years ago to resume Tibetan negotiations as soon as possible after the Washington conference. His Excellency replied that he was bearing the matter in mind, but that as Parliament was now sitting it would be necessary to consult the parliamentary leaders before proceeding further.In view of the instability of the present eentral Government and the complicated internal political situation, there is,&apos;I fear, small prospect of an early resumption of negotiations.Situation in Manchuria [F.C.R., Ixxvii, p. 2]. Telegraphing on 16th September, Sir Beilby Alston informed the Foreign Office that he had received a report from the British Consul at vladivostock that a mission from Chang-tso-lin, with which the Chinese Government disclaimed any connexion, had arrived at Vladivostock on 3rd September. The ostensible motive for the mission was the conclusion of arrange-ments for mutual assistance in controlling the passage of the border, while permitting White agents to pass through Manchuria, and, if necessary, the withdrawal of White troops from provinces on the sea-board.The British Consul-General at Mukden reported that Chang-tsodin has received a quantity of ammunition for his Russian guns from the Vladivostock Government as a. consideration for the advantages to be derived from these arrangements.CZECHO-SLO-slovakia.Treaty with Jugo-Slavia [F.C.R., LXXVII, p. 2], Sir George&apos; Clerk reported on 6th September that the Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav treaty had been signed at Marienbad on 31st August, and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had communi-cated to him the confidential text.It appeared from this that the principal point was contained in the fourth article, which dealt with the protection of common interests, and made provision for mutual support in international matters, whether diplomatic or political; the particular
-bearing of this clause being directed against the display by Italy of an over-warm interest in the affairs of Austria in her present crisis.. r A further point to be remarked was that the duration of the treaty was only for five years instead of for a period three or four times as long, as had been supposed. Provision was also made for a commercial treaty, and the existing treaty of 14th August 1920 was prolonged to cover the period of the new treaty..EGYPT.Smyrna Refugees. The following request was telegraphed by Lord Allenby on 10th September:  -i-Ships are reported to be on the way to Alexandria with refugees from Smyrna. An influx of Greek or Armenian refugees into Egypt in any numbers would constitute -a danger to the public security, and 1 earnestly trust that His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Smyrna will not grant British visas for landing here, except to British, French, Italian, American and Egyptian subjects. Exceptions may also be made in the case of Greek and other nationalities, where the applicant can show that he is self-supporting, and has close family or business connexions in Egypt, but I should be glad if such could be previously referred t6* the Director-General of Public Security, Cairo, address Amnam.Arab Movements in Sinai. On 12th September Lord Allenby telegraphed as follows : A force of some 1,500 Wahabis is reported to be about 50 miles south-east -of. Akaba, and to be advancing northward. Their objective is unknown, but the British and Egyptian military authorities are concerting measures to assist the frontier districts&apos; administration, if necessary, in dealing with any inroad into the Sinai peninsula. The Governor of Sinai has been instructed to keep in touch with the General Officer Commanding, Palestine, and to co-operate if necessary.I have agreed with the Prime Minister that the intervention of British and Egyptian troops, if it becomes necessary, should be simultaneous. The Egyptian Government will bear the expense of aerial reconnaissance and other measures,FINLAND.Political Situation. Mr. Forbes sent the following telegram from Helsingfors on 12th September :  iParliament having assembled, the Cabinet of [Affairs consider their mission fulfilled aud have tendered their resignation. The President has requested.them to carry on until a new Government is formed.GERMANY.Negotiations with Belgium. Lord D&apos;Abernon made the following report oir 10th &quot;September : The position of the negotiations between the German Government and the Belgian delegation is stated somewhat differently by the two parties, but &quot;it appeared certain that an agreement had been reached on all points except that.of prolonging bills of exchange beyond six months. The refusal of the Belgians regarding this is based on the legal point that they would be contravening the decision of the Reparations Commission. The German impression is that if other Powers, represented on the Reparations Commission, stated that they did not object to the proposed prolongation, the Belgian Government would not themselves object to it.M. Delacroix&apos;s mission, although momentarily unsuccessful, has cleared the ground considerably. Approval of the guarantee has been obtained from the directorate, and has been accepted in principle by Belgium. The idea of a gold -deposit has been dropped.Sir J. Bradbury&apos;s proposal has been discussed. It is strongly desired by the German Government. At first it was resisted by the Belgians very vigorously ; later somewhat more mildly. But Brussels still refuses absolutely to join with Germany in -asking for it. If it was proposed to them from another quarter whether they would still object is doubtful.I regard the prospect of final agreement as still fair to good. It was never probable that the negotiations would finish this week.
On 18th.September.Mr. Addison telegraphed as follows : I hear from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the President of the Reichsbank having concluded a satisfactory private arrangement in England, a note will be sent to the Belgian Government to-morrow, agreeing to the fieiehsbank&apos;s guarantee of a six months&apos; bill, without the condition of prolongation, -Referring to the above telegram, Sir George Graham sent the folio wing -message-from Brussels on 19th September : The Minister for Foreign Affairs interns me that he has received a note from the-German Charge d&apos;Affaires notifying the Reichsbank&apos;s guarantee without condition of prolongation.His -Excellency expressed his appreciation of British support in effecting the settlement of the question.GREECE.New Cabinet. On 8th September Mr. Bentinck telegraphed as follows : The Government resigned yesterday evening.   The King has entrusted M. Calo-geropoulos with the duty of forming a Cabinet.   The latter has asked for 24 hours&apos;delay before -replying- *Mr. Bentinck further reported on the evening of the Hth September thatM. Calogeropoulos had formed a Cabinet, but that it was not expected to be longlived.The.following day Mr. Bentinck reported that M. Calogeropoulos after all had failed, and that M. Triandaphyliacos, late High Commissioner at Constantinople, whose co-operation Calogeropoulos had invited, was then endeavouring to form a Ministry. If he failed it was expected that the King would fall back upon General Metaxas.A later telegram announced that M. Triandaphyliacos had been successful, and on 11th September Mr. Bentinck reported as follows : The following is the Government: -(-    M. Triandaphyliacos - - Premier and War, and provisionally Marine.M. Calogeropoulos - - Foreign Affairs.M. Pjousios       - - - Interior, and provisionally Supplies.&quot; M. Maneas       .... National Economy.M. Yannopoulos - - - Justice, and provisionally Refugees.M. Matsas        - Communications, and provisionally Posts.M. Eutaxias     - - - Finance, and provisionally Public Treasure.M. Skouphos     - - - Education, and provisionally Agriculture.The General Situation. On 10th September Mr. Bentinck telegraphed as follows : The general situation is calm, but there is a certain amount of nervousness, especially in view of the difficulty experienced in forming a Government and the return of discontented troops. The police have prohibited all open-air meetings or gatherings in Athens and the piraeus.His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Volo reports apprehension lest the large communistic-element there should join the soldiers on their return. The Union of Volo business men has telegraphed to the King urging the recall of M. Venizelos to save the country. Similar action on the part of two deputies for Thrace resulted in their arrest.General Constantinopoulos is taking severe measures to prevent criticism of the . Government by the press.Telegraphing on 12th September, Mr. Bentinck reported an improved appearance in the situation consequent on the formation of the new Government, The beginning of any potential trouble might be expected in the provinces rather than in the capital.. General dissatisfaction and dejection existed everywhere, coupled with apprehensions of danger in Thrace, of the attitude of Serbia and Bulgaria, and of the doubtful future of Constantinople. Tentative suggestions had-been made by the supporters of M. Venizelos that aid from the British Government might be forthcoming if King Constantine were removed. But it was realized that bloodshed would be inevitable unless the retirement were voluntary.The complete evacuation of the Smyrna area had been announced in the press, and thousands of demobilized soldiers were returning. Many refugees of the better class had arrived in Greece, while vast numbers were flocking to the islands off the Asia Minor coast.
Press -Restrictions. Oil ; 15th&quot; September;- Mr. Bentinck sent the following telegram:- J. - General Constantinopoulos, the head of the military district of Athens, issued the following orders to the press : (1) All articles or interviews with politicians or military men respecting the responsibility for the Asia Minor debacle are prohibited. (2) All mention of disturbances.or movements in Thrace is prohibited. (3) Articles tending to excite the public ever the situation are prohibited. (4) Publication of the present order is. prohibited and will be, deleted by the censor.These restrictions, which are unconstitutional, were anonymous,, but the. press were informed verbally that they came from Constantinopoulos.Governments Acknowledgments. Mr. Bentinck sent the following telegram on 14th September : -   &apos; ,The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that as the evacuation of Asia Minor is practically completed an armistice is objectless.His Excellency desires me to convey the thanks of the Greek Government to His Majesty&apos;s Government for having interested themselves on Greece&apos;s behalf.Export of Gold. Information received by Mr.. Bentinck on 6th September, and telegraphed by him on 14th September, Was to the effect that 25 millions&apos; worth of gold francs had been despatched to the Federal Reserve . Bank, New York, from the National Bank in Athens. This represented half the reserve amount at the home bank, and Mr. Bentinck had been informed that the remainder might follow. To enable this to be effected a law had been passed recently, of which the financial commission had no previous knowledge./HOLLAND.Neto Cabinet.

Sir Ronald Graham sent the following information on 18th September : The following semi-official communication appeared in the Tribuna last night r-&apos;&quot; We have reason to believe that Italy would not participate in the eventuality of military operations/ which might be provoked in the East should Asiatic complications be extended to European territory.&quot; Italy will always maintain solidarity with her Allies in defending the principle of liberty of the Straits, but she could not employ her military forces should hostilities, which she has made every attempt to avoid by peaceful negotiations, be extended in their scope.&quot;JAPAN.The Position in Siberia [F.C.R., LXXVII, p. 5].-Sir Charles Eliot reported on 6th September that he had received the following information from Vladivostock : The evacuation of Japanese troops from Spassky and the Suehan districts took place as arranged on 26th August. The Whites at once occupied Spassky, and have since forced the Reds to withdraw to the north of Lake Hanka. The Reds, however, hold the Suchan district.The first transport with Japanese troops left for Tsuruga 3rd September ; prior to the evacuation of troops, about 1,500 Japanese and Koreans, resident in Spassky, 44-3 , B
Nikolsk, and the Suchan districts, left for Japan and Korea. Only very few now remain there.:- On 16th September Sir Charles Eliot transmitted a further message received from Vladivostock, which is as follows ; .-:. Mr. Hori, the new chief of the Japanese diplomatic mission, informs me that the stand taken by the Russian delegates at Changchun regarding the representation of the Soviets at the conference, is doe to the intention of Soviet Russia eventually to-absorb the far eastern republic. .&apos;   -He states that, with the exception of a few miles north of Nikolsk, there are now, ho Japanese troops between Nikolsk and Pogranitchnaya, and that the railway is guarded by White troops. The Japanese troops between Pogranitchnaya and Harbin have also been withdrawn.Prom 18th September Japanese troops will begin, to withdraw from Nikolsk to Razdolnoye, and after 20th September it will be theoretically possible for the Reds to enter Nikolsk.In a battle near Ussuri on 8th September, in which the Reds and the Whites numbered about 2,000 each, the Reds lost 300, and have withdrawn to the north of the Ussuri river.PERSIA.The Cabinet and the Press [F.C.R., LXXVII, p. 6], Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed from Teheran on 13th September as follows : The Persian Government has released the suppressed newspapers, but a printers strike temporarily prevents their publication.The Mujtehids, whom Sir Percy Cox invited to leave Iraq, are heading for Teheran, and are causing trouble; their alleged expulsion by the British authorities threatens, to cause fresh anti-British agitation.Anglo-American Oil Concessions [F.C.R., lxxiv, p. 5]. The following telegram was sent by Sir Percy Loraine on 13th September :-The Prune Minister .has submitted to the Medjliss the latest proposals of the Standard Oil Company and SinclaiFs,. requesting it to decide between them. The Medjliss retorted that it was the Governments business to present its conclusions, which Parliament would no doubt accept. The matter therefore rests with the Prime Minister....      -   -     &apos;    RUMANIA.Attitiide on the Straits Question.1 On 14th September Mr. Millington Drake telegraphed the following passage, which appeared the previous night in the political article of the Viitorul, the recognized mouthpiece of the present Liberal Government:  ; ., &quot;The lessons of the&quot; war have shown the Allies the immense prejudice to the cause of civilization resulting from the closing of the Straits. It brought about the collapse of Rumania and Russia, who were thereby deprived of munitions of war, the entry into the war of Bulgaria, and above all the dissolution of Russia and the success of the Bolsheviks. For this reason the Allies will maintain the treaty of Sevres in its broad lines. Rumania is interested in the freedom of the Straits, and cannot admit a change in the Balkan equilibrium to her disadvantage, and declares her solidarity in the common interests of all the other Allies in the maintenance of the freedom of the Straits.&apos;&apos;Mr. Millington Drake added that his despatch of the same date reported that the same paper advocated the internationalization of Constantinople and the Straits, or the creation of a neutral buffer State there between Greece and Turkey. The whole of the Rumanian press expressed similar views, claiming that Rumania, must have a voice in the settlement of the Straits question.A telegram from the Foreign Office to Mr. Millington Drake, dated 15th September, in acknowledgment of the foregoing message, expressed the satisfaction of His Majesty s Government at the views so emphatically put forward by the Government organ. It pointed out the danger which menaced both the freedom of the Straits, and the equilibrium, of Balkan affairs, as the result of Kemalist successes, and urged the necessity of guarding against this danger before it was too late.
,. SERBIA. .Attitude on the Eastern Crisis. Sir Alban Young sent the following telegram from Belgrade on 15th September:; It will be difficult for the present to learn here with certainty what orientation the.-Serb-Croat-Slovene Government may be contemplating towards the Turco-Greek crisis.The Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs told me to-day that only four out of -.20 Ministers of State are in Belgrade, so that no policy can be authoritatively&apos; initiated. Monsieur Nesic, a high functionary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been telegraphed for to join M. Pasitch at Marienbad. The papers state that M. Pasitch will proceed to Paris and London, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot confirm this. Monsieur Nincic will not return from Geneva before 20th September, and our representatives there will doubtless be in contact with him.On 18th September Sir Alban telegraphed the following further information : -The press bureau to-day publishes  &quot;dementi of the alleged pro-Turkish statement -of M. Nincic to the Paris Mtitin, and states that M. Nincic is opposed to any territorial-modification in the Balkans. I understand that M. Nincic is now in London, and that M. Pasitch will meet him iu Paris on his return there ; consequently no decisions will be taken in Belgrade for the present.The press continues to pronounce against a Turco^Bulgarian common frontier, but in general public opinion is very calm. Mussulmans have been celebrating the Turkish victory. All reports as to any kind of mobilization measures on the part of this country are without foundation.No action has yet been taken in conformity with the Greek request for strong pressure to be brought to bear on Bulgaria in regard to bands threatening Thrace. The Bulgarian Charge d&apos;Affaires has given formal assurances with regard to the -correct attitude of the Bulgarian Government, but stated that the latter relies on the Powers to take the opportunity of settling the Thracian question, and according to Bulgaria the promised outlet to the sea. -The Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs hears that the Greek armies in Thrace -are (? group omitted) ing discontent at not being demobilized like those returning to Greece.SPAIN.Policy in Morocco. On 4th September Sir Esme Howard reported a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he had enquired what was the Government policy in Morocco, and what was the position as regarded-the High Commissioner. The Minister had replied that there was complete agreement between the Government and the High Commissioner. As to the declared policy of occupjdng Alhucemas Bay, the Minister had said that this had been approved by the Government if it could be carried out without resorting to arms, and authority had been given to General Burguete to proceed on those lines. Although the Government had not given any authority for military operations in occupying Alhucemas, it was not to be understood that they would not be undertaken should circumstances require them.Regarding negotiations with Raisuli the Minister spoke in sanguine terms, in which Sir Esme placed no great faith. The latter was of opinion that the. Government had arrived at no determined plan of operations in Morocco.TURKEY.Fathy Bey&apos;s Reception.-Referring to a telegram from Sir Ronald Graham reporting a conversation he had had in Rome with Nizami Pasha, Lord Curzon sent the following telegram to Sir Ronald on 13th September : -I observe that you report Osman Nizami Pasha as deeply deploring on behalf of Fathy Bey that His Majesty&apos;s Government refused to receive the latter, who had been specially sent by Mustapha Kemal to ascertain Our views and wishes, and the refusal -to receive whom was regarded by Kemal &quot; as a personal slight.&quot; This absurd and belated attempt to throw responsibility for recent Turkish actions upon the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Fathy Bey has received wide circulation .in the press and merits emphatic repudiation. No intimation was made to us that Fathy Bey came on special mission from Kemal. He is not even Foreign Minister of that Government, as was Yusuf Kemal Bey, with whom I spent many hours in fruitless conversations in March last. He did not ask the Prime Minister to see him, nor did His Majesty&apos;s Government refuse to receive him. On the contrary, after he- had already had a conversation with my private secretary, 1 asked, being unable, owing to
medical treatment in the country, to receive him myself, that he should be specially invited to the Foreign Office to make a full statement of his case to Sir William Tyrrell and Mr. Lindsay. This he did, and when it was found that he had nothing: to propose; beyond terms of national pact, it was felt unnecessary to pursue the matter, the more so as at that time we were arranging for a joint conference of the allied High Commissioners with the Turkish and Greek representatives, and that negotia-tions with Kemal by any single Power had always been, regarded by us as inconsistent with loyalty to the Alliance. You may make such use of this explanation as you. think desirable.Official Account of Events in Smyrna.   On 18th September Sir Horace-Rumbold telegraphed the following account of events in Smyrna, which had been supplied to him by Mr. Hole, Vice-Consul at Smyrna, who bad arrived at Oon-stantinople on 16th September: The retreating Greek army had undoubtedly committed grave excesses on the march from the interior, but they reached Smyrna in a state of exhaustion, and no-excesses on their part within the town came to Mr. Hole&apos;s knowledge. The evacua-tion of Greek troops in Smyrna was completed by 8th September. Something like 50,000 refugees had also arrived from the interior ; of these no more than 5,000 were-able to leave.On 9th September at 11, Turkish cavalry entered the town, which was formally surrendered by the allied representatives. They were perfectly in hand and gave every assurance regarding the safety of persons and property. The Turkish civil population, who previous to evacuation had been pleading their defenceless condition,, appeared all over Smyrna.armed to the teeth. There was some looting and murder,, but&apos;the Turkish occupying officer explained that as soon as he had sufficient forces at his disposal the city would be tranquillized. On arrival on 10th September of a division of regular infantry, incidents rather increased than diminished, and the army was responsible for much looting. Several British houses, notably at Burnobacl,. were forced, and in tbe streets patrols held up and robbed civilians.On 10th September the Italian consul-general informed Mr. Hole confidentially that that evening an important decision concerning the deportation of Armenians-was to be arrived at, at Konak. The following day was the first of Armenian massacre. Certain Armenians had furnished a pretext for the adoption of vigorous measures by having bombs in their possession,&apos;and a systematic hunt now took place. Men were killed in large numbers and parties were formed and driven off. Sir IP Lamb succeeded in partially penetrating into the Armenian quarter, and counted 20 bodies in 50 yards.On 12th September fires broke out at several points in the Armenian quarter.. The Turks asserted that the Armenians burnt clown their houses to discredit them in the eyes of Europe. It may, however, be remarked that the first houses fired were1 all to windward of the district, and that in the evening, when some of the fires had died down, a new one was started half-a-inile to windward again. The whole quarter had been surrounded by a Turkish cordon since the previous clay.The natural spread of the fire was accelerated by new fires started in the-European quarter; this was particularly noticeable the following morning, when the wind blowing now from the European quarter, half-a-dozen houses burst severally into flames half-a-mile to windward,Mr. Hole has no doubt that both massacre and fire, including the destruction of the European quarter, were the deliberate work of Turks, carried out by order of responsible authorities, the object of the former being vengeance against the Armenians who had sided with the Greeks, and of the latter to root out Christian and foreign influence generally.The flight of the refugees is pitiable ; they wore herded together on the narrow quay, with such few possessions as they had been able to save, with, very little possibility of obtaining water or food and none of shelter. About 1,500 were, for the past week, crowded into lighters against the exterior of the breakwater, ancljshot if they attempted to escape.The evacuation of the British colony was completed on 12th September. Possibly a dozen British elected to remain and a certain, number of. Maltese. One. British subject, Mr. Murphy, was wounded in his house by looting regular soldiers, and died 12th September. So far as Mr. Hole knows, there was no other loss of British life.. The attitude of the Turks towards consular authorities was correct after the first trying on of non-recognition, but a Turkish guard was placed outside the consulate-.general.   This was not done at the other consulates. . ; \.
