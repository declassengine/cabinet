FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.- ALBANIA.Anglo-Italian Formula. On 23th September Lord Curzon informed [No. 536] Lord Hardinge that the Italian Government had definitely accepted the following-formula, and instructed their representative at Geneva to withdraw his opposition to the discussion of the Albanian question by the Assembly : The Governments represented in the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris,, recognizing that the independence of Albania, as well as the integrity and inalien-ability of its frontiers,&apos; as defined by their decision, is a matter of international concern, and recognizing that the violation of these frontiers or of the independence of Albania might constitute a menace to the strategical security of Italy, are agreed as follows: (1) In the event of Albania being unable to maintain her territorial integrity she shall be at liberty to apply to the Council of the League of Nations for external assistance. . -(2) The Governments represented on the Conference of Ambassadors undertake that, in that event, they will instruct their representatives on the Council to recommend that the restoration of the territorial frontiers of Albania be entrusted to Italy.(3) Should a menace to the integrity or independence of Albania, either territorial or economic, arise, whether from external aggression or from any other cause, and should Albania not have recourse within a reasonable time to the procedure contemplated in Article 1 above, then the above Governments will bring the facts to the notice of the Council of the League of Nations, and, if the Council consider that intervention is justified, will give to their representatives the same instructions as those contemplated in Article 2 of this agreement.(4) If the Council of the League -,of Nations should decide by a majority vote that they cannot usefully intervene, the Governments represented in the Conference of Ambassadors will reconsider the question, conforming their decisions to the idea expressed in the preamble, namely, that any violation of the Albanian frontiers constitutes a menace to the strategical security of Italy.Your Italian colleague has been instructed to obtain the consent of the French Govsrnment to this formula and to arrange for its immediate passage as a resolution of the Conference of Ambassadors.Please give the Italian Ambassador all assistance.ARABIA.Negotiations with King Hussein. Colonel Lawrence, reporting [No. L. 16] on the discussions which had taken place up to 8th September on the proposed treaty with King Hussein, stated the final modifications in the articles of the treaty which were put forward for acceptance. Among these was a proposal to substitute &quot; His Hashimite Majesty&quot; or &quot;Arab-Hashimite Government&quot; for &quot;&quot;Hejaz,&quot; where this&apos; occurred in the treaty.Telegraphing [No. 1] on 9th September the Secretary of State enquired the precise significance of the proposed substitution, pointing out that recognition had only been given to a &quot; King of the Hejaz,&quot; and that &quot;Hejaz&quot; alone was mentioned in the Versailles treaty as a member of the League of Nations.On 11th September Colonel Lawrence replied [No. L. 18] that the suggestion came.from Hussein, and that he himself thought that &quot; Arab-Hashimite Government&quot; was a convenient style, since Hussein&apos;s present area was in some places more and in some places less than the Turkish Hejaz ; and considering the fluid character of the State, a family, rather than a geographical, title might prove an advantage.   It
offered no conflict with or negation to the use of the word &quot; Hejaz &quot; in the Versailles treaty, and would in no way affect any claim to be ruler of anything inside or outside the Hejaz limits.On .16th September the Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 6] as follows: The proposed substitution of His Hashimite Majesty &quot; or &quot; Arab-Iiashimite Government&quot; for &quot; Hejaz &quot; it approved. I should prefer the former. The words &quot; in the territory of &quot; will in consecpience require to be inserted in several articles.Colonel Lawrence reported [No. L.25] on 22nd September that King Hussein had approved each clause in the treaty, and had publicly announced his intention of signing it When, however, Ali presented it for ratification, he flew into a rage, .and then sent various sets of contradictory and unacceptable conditions. Ali was preparing with Zeid to obtain his formal abdication.According to the telegram [No. 567] sent by Colonel Lawrence through Cairo on 25th September, there was little alteration in the position. Colonel Lawrence thought that King. Hussein&apos;s shortness of money might induce him to give his signature, but in the meantime he had informed Ali and Zeid that until the King-had sent him the treaty signed he would take no action.AUSTRIA.A:nglo-French Advance. The following instructions were sent [No. 530] to Lord Hardinge on 24th September :-In order to allow for American consideration of the release of the relief credit obligations, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to consider a proposal for the -advance of 250,000i. to Austria for food purchases abroad, provided a similar sum were advanced for the same purpose by France. &apos;It is essential that both French and. British advances should be used for the financing of food purchases abroad; that the amount and nature of the advances should, be kept confidential; and that they should nominally be made by a bank (which, as regards the British share, would probably be the Anglo-Austrian Bank).The French Ambassador has intimated that the French Government are ready to&apos;participate, but that they must make it an express condition that the Austrian Government should submit acceptable proposals for the settlement of the arrears of the pre-war Austrian debt held in France.   .We fear that insistence on this condition may wreck the scheme or delay it indefinitely. Moreover, the Austrian Minister informs us that the Austrian Government have already made proposals on the point to the French Government.You should, therefore, express to the French Government the earnest hope that they will not raise difficulties under this head&apos;, and that they will join with us in making the advance with the least possible delay. The financial and economic position of Austria is such that if the advance is further postponed, its utility as a remedy for the present situation must be greatly diminished.In making a communication in the above sense, you should add that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that an advance of 500,000Z. will be inadequate by itself, and that further assistance will, in all probability, be required. In that event, they will lie prepared to consider the possibility of making a further advance, provided that the French Government will do the same.&apos; Please impress on the French Government that it is most important to withhold from the press and the public any information as to the amount how proposed. If the amount is known it will be regarded in Austria as wholly inadequate, and the position of-the Austrian Government will be made more difficult.CENTRAL AMERICA.The. Constitution of the New Republic. The following paragraph appeared in. the Times of 4th October: The Guatemalan Legation in London has received official telegrams -announcing that the Central American constitution was solemnly promulgated on Sunday. The authorities have taken the oath of allegiance to the new federal flag of the Republic of Central America constituted by the States, of &quot;Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras.
CHINA.    .Shantung. The following telegram [No. 368] was sent from Peking by Sir Beilby Alston on 27th September : I &quot;asked the Japanese Minister to-day what progress was being made with the Shantung proposals. He said that be had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 23rd September that, as he had had a fortnight to consider them, he would be glad of some answer. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had replied that the delay was due to the fact that 10 days had not been long enough for the public to form their opinion of these proposals; that owing to the Cabinet crisis the Premier was not attending his office , and that he was convening a conference of those opposed to direct negotiations, Mr. Obata reminded him that when he went on leave last May the Minister for Foreign Affairs had suggested that he should persuade the Japanese Government to put forward moderate proposals for negotiation, and that in consequence he had had many discussions with his Government and the officials at Tokyo. Furthermore, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had himself privately sent a delegate to Japan in May last with certain proposals, which did not differ fundamentallv from those now put forward by the Japanese Government; and he warned the Minister for Foreign Affairs that when these facts became known a very unfavourable&apos; impression would be created towards China. The Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to try to hasten the decision, but the Japanese Minister expressed his disappointment and had little hope of receiving a favourable reply.Mr. Obata thinks this question is delaying the decision as to the Minister for Foreign Affairs going to Washington, and he hears that Alfred processes has warned the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the liberal elements there are likely to make it very hot for him and might even assassinate him.The Japanese Minister confirms my impression that the Premier and the Minister&apos; for Foreign Affairs are both in favour of direct negotiations with Japan, but apparently dare not face public opinion.Financial Situation. Telegraphing [No. 372] on 3rd October Sir Beilby Alston submitted the following brief resume of the financial position, as, he said, the question of Chinese finances seemed bound to come up at the conference either from a demand for tariff revision or in some other way :-Competent observers here agree that the financial situation is far worse than is generally realized. The Chinese Government has .come to the end not only of its resources but of its credit, and, unless some new and dependable revenue can be found, complete chaos must ensue in the near future, resulting in the collapse of all central authority and anarchy throughout the country.Your Lordship has approved the proposal not to support the Japanese proposal for a 25 per&apos;cent, increase in-the customs duties. The United States Government are equally opposed to this, apart from the unsoimclness of allowing the Chinese Government to impose surtaxes a precedent which would be liable to flagrant abuse-Such a surtax would only be a measure of temporary relief, serving to keep the present Government going a few months longer and to give a fictitious fillip to-Chinese credit.There would appear to be two alternatives : either to leave the Chinese Govern-rnent to get out of the present financial impasse in her own way and trust to her weathering once more the dangers of bankruptcy and disintegration,&apos; without ignoring, however, the risk she will continue to run of being a prey to every aggressor, or for some comprehensive scheme to be put forward at the conference for rehabilitating the financial position under foreign control. This might take the form of a mixed commission, invested with adequate powers for a period of years, to assume the control of specified revenues and expenditure and the reorganization of the unsecured public debt. The only new revenue which could be fully relied on would be an increase in the customs. Pending an agreement on tariff revision it might be necessary to consider the imposition of a surtax as part of such a scheme, despite the general objection to surtaxes and solely in order to provide the funds necessary to enable any financial commission of control to operate effectively. In short, the present conditions indicate that the question of financial reform must take precedence of all other reforms which may be raised at the conference.CUBA.Proposed Commercial Agreement with the United States. On 28th September Mr. Haggard telegraphed [No. 61] the information that, as a result of the new American
tariff against foreign sugars, from which the Cuban sugar industry would suffer &quot;terribly, a bill would shortly be proposed in Congress providing for a new commercial treaty with the United States. The object would be to secure the free import of sugar into the United States in return either for a free import of American goods into Cuba or the imposition of a 30 per cent, duty on imports from other countries. In either event British goods would be penalized.&apos;CZECHOSLOVAKIA. &apos;&apos; New Ministry--On 27th September Sir George Clerk reported [Mo. 113] that a new Ministry had been formed as follows :  M. Benes -	-	-   Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Cerny -		-   Interior.M. Udrzal	- -	-   National Defence.M. Novak -	-	-  Finance.M. Stanek-	-	-   Commerce.M. Sramek	-	-   Railways.M. Derer -	-	-   Unification.M. Srba   -	-	-   Posts and Telegraphs.M. Vrcensky	-	-  Health.M. Habrmann	-	-   Social Welfare.M. Tucny -	-	-  Public Works. ,M. Srobar-	-	-.. Education.M. Dolansky		-   Justice.M. Micura-	-	-   Slovakia.Sir George added that only MM. Benes, Cerny and Micura were in the last Ministry.Telegraphing again [No. 121] on 3rd October Sir George Clerk said that M. Benes, on his appointment to the Prime Ministership, had received many congratulatory telegrams from European statesmen; notably one from MM. Briand and Berthelot, expressing the satisfaction felt by the French Government that the Government of the Czecho-Slovak people had been entrusted to the great&quot; patriot whose friendly feelings for France were a guarantee that the two countries would work together more than ever to assure that peace was maintained and treaties respected.FRANCE.Colonial Native Army. Lord Hardinge reported [No. 693] on 21st September that some stir had been created in Paris by the Minister for. the Colonies stating, in an interview with a newspaper correspondent on the eve of his departure for West Africa: &quot; If we are going to be able to reduce military service in France in the near future it is thanks to our colonies. We shall indeed have a new military organization based on a native army of 300,000 men.&quot;GERMANY.The Proposed Coalition. -On 2nd October Lord d&apos;Abernon reported [No. 473] that the Reichstag had adjourned for a month, and that the negotiations for the entry of the Peopled party into the Government coalition had been postponed, partly owing to the provocation and rather unwise speech of the Chancellor, partly to the Berlin Socialists not endorsing the decision of the party at Gorlitz. The Berlin Majority Socialists would, he said, prefer an endeavour to coalesce with the Independent Socialists rather than with the People&apos;s party. Negotiations to this end have been started, but do not promise much success. Probably after an interval, the attempt to bring the People&apos;s party into the Government will be resumed.Ratification of the Treaty with the United States.-On 1st October Lord cPAbernon reported [No. 472] that the treaty of peace between Germany and the United States had been ratified by the Reichstag on the previous day.   The Communists had voted against and the German Nationalists had abstained from voting. 33-1 b
Union of German Industries.-On 30th September Lord d&apos;abernon telegraphed [No. -170] that a general meeting of the Union of German Industries at Munich had passed the following resolution : This Union, convinced of the necessity of fulfilling the terms of the London ultimatum, is prepared to make use of the credit which it enjoys abroad for the purpose of placing gold and foreign exchanges at the disposal of the Government provided that banks and other commercial and agricultural circles give similar support and that measures are promptly taken to put the State finances into order.GREECE.The Retirement of the Army [F.C.R.,lii, p. 4]. Lord Granville sent the following telegram [No. 501] from Athens on 21st September : The President of the Council, who did not appear at all cheerful, assured me this morning that the decision to retire had been taken because a further advance, though it would have been useful, was not essential and would have been very costly, and also because the rains were about to begin and would make communication difficult. The army was retiring gradually, removing everything and leaving a desert. The final line was not definitely settled, but would probably be just to the east of Eskishehr.As the campaign was over, the King would probably return to Athens next week.I asked whether they meant to take the first step towards negotiations with Kemal and he said no, they would hold the line decided on and see what happened. He made no allusion to mediation.HUNGARY.The Situation. Telegraphing [No. 307] from Budapest on 1st October Mr. Hohler reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had given him the following account of the present situation.: When M. Benes made the offer of mediation, the Hungarian Government was embarrassed on account of the negotiations with Italy, whom, as a Great Power, they naturally wished to treat with the greatest deference. The Austrian consul-General therefore at once pressed the Italian Minister for a reply to their counter-proposal, but receiving none up to the evening of the 25th September and M. Benes being urgent, the Minister for Foreign Affairs started (? that) night and met him at Brnnn. The meeting was of a very seemly nature, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained the state of negotiations with Italy, of which M. Benes was already cognizant through the Austrian Chancellor.Meanwhile the Italian answer came in the form of making secret negotiations with (? the Chancellor) and communicating them to France and England. M. Benes&apos; offer is at present limited to offering to the Great Powers his good offices in bringing about an arrangement which would be in accordance with a general and permanent peace and therefore in the interest of his country.The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that M. Benes had despatched a telegram in this sense to the Powers on the evening of 26th September.It was clear from the language of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would prefer the mediation of Czecho-Slovakia.I said I knew nothing about these mediations and could only regard the note of the conference as authoritative, and again exhorted him to hasten to concentrate his attention on that and on the peace treaty. He replied that they would pursue the negotiations as actively as possible, but if there was no result up to the night of the 3rd October the Hungarian officials and gendarmes would be withdrawn by the hour fixed, though he thought it his duty to say that in this case the situation in the comitats would be very serious.JAPAN. ;The Pacific Conference-Sh Charles Eliot reported [No. 370] from Tokyo on 27th September that.the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the three
ohief delegates at the conference would be Admiral Baron Kato, Minister of Marine, Baron Shidehara, Japanese Ambassador at Washington, and Prince Tokungawa, President of the House of Peers, and that they would all be officially on the same footing.PERSIA.South Persia Rifles [F.C.R., lii, p. 5].-On 20th September Mr. Norman trans-mitted [No. 521] a message from the South Persia Rifles begging him to endeavour to persuade His Majesty&apos;s Government, if there seemed any hope, of their reconsidering their decision. It was contended that it would be difficult to explain to the Persian ranks the refusal to comply with the proposal of the -Persian Government. The unwillingness of the Persian Government to find funds had been given as the reason . Tor the disbandment of two-thirds of the force, but it was asked what reason could be given for the disbandment of the remainder. An alternative proposal was to get the Persian Government to agree to Qawam&apos;s suggestion&apos; to maintain 1,000 South Persia Rifles in Fare as gendarmerie, in the hope that in view of past satisfactory relations with Qawam His Majesty&apos;s Government might also approve. The collection and destruction of the arms in possession of the remaining 1,600 men would be a matter of chance, and they might well fall into the possession of less desirable, people than Qawam or the Persian Government.Telegraphing [No. 522] on 20th September in sequence to the above, Mr. Norman explained that QawanPs suggestion had been made by the Governor-General of Fars to the Shah at the beginning of the month, and by Qawam to the Prime Minister for consideration by the Medjliss, but so far there had been no result. In view of the dissolution of the South Persia Rifles and of the spread of Russian influence in the north, Qawam, with whom the proposal originated, was seeking a means of saving the south from Bolshevism, and for some time had been strengthening his own position to that end.Mr. Norman reported that he had suggested to the Inspector-General, as a reason for the final disbandment, that the proposal of the Persian Government offered no guarantee for the effective maintenance of a highly disciplined force in possession of a large quantity of munitions.The Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 385] on 26th September his approval of Mr. Normans suggestion.The following message from the.consular officer at Kermari was transmitted .[No. 537] by Mr. Norman on 28th September: The spread of the news of the impending disbandment of the South Persia Rifles has caused disorders on a large scale in the province, which the Governor-General is powerless to check, owing to the small force maintained by him and the practical non-existence of Qara Suran, payment for which is shared by the Governor-General and the Head of the Department. Large robberies have taken place on the Yezd, Bunder-Abbas and Ivhorassan roads, in which British subjects alone have lost over 37,000 tomans&apos; worth of goods. Bands have appealed in the Sirjan and Khaclri districts .and have looted several villages. The Governor-General is endeavouring to prevent reports of these.disorders reaching the capital.Mr. Norman added : The anticipated results of the dissolution of the South Persia Rifles are thus already beginning to appear.On 1 st October Mr. Bridgeman, acting in the place of Mr. Norman, reported [No. 548] that when the latter took his leave of the President of the Council this Minister appealed to him that the Persian Government might be allowed to purchase rifles, guns and machine guns from the South Persia Rifles. The Persian Govern-ment was proposing to create a force from the disbanded South Persia Rifles for the purpose of preserving order in the Kerman and Fars districts, but no arms would be available if His Majesty&apos;s Government adhered to the instructions they had given. Mr. Bridgeman, in view of the situation, advocated compliance with the request, especially as purchase by the Persian Government would remove the risk of the last 1,600 rifles falling into less desirable hands.Mr. Bridgeman transmitted [Nos. 549 and 550] on 1st and 2nd October messages from the Inspector-General, strongly advocating the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-
chief delegates at the conference would be Admiral Baron Kato, Minister of Marine, Baron Shidehara, Japanese Ambassador at Washington, and Prince Tokungawa, -President of the House of Peers, and that they would all be officially on the same footing..PERSIA.South Peisia Rifles [F.O.R., lii, p. 5]. On 20th September Mr. Norman trans-mitted [No. 521] a message from the South Persia Rifles begging him to endeavour to persuade His Ma.jesty&apos;s Government, if there seemed any hope, of their reconsidering their decision, It was contended that it would be difficult to explain to the Persian ranks the refusal to comply with the proposal of the Persian Government. The unwillingness of the Persian Government to find funds had been given as the reason for the disbandment of two-thirds of the force, but it was asked what reason could be given for the disbandment of the remainder. An alternative proposal was to get the Persian Government to agree to Qawam&apos;s suggestion&apos; to maintain 1,000 South Persia Rifles in Ears as gendarmerie, in the hope that in view of past satisfactory relations with Qawam His Majesty&apos;s Government might also approve. The collection and destruction of the arms in possession of the remaining 1,600 men would be a matter of chance, and they might well fall into the possession of less desirable, people than Qawam or the Persian Government.Telegraphing [No. 522] on 20th September in sequence to the above, Mr. Norman -explained that Qawam-s suggestion had been made by the Governor-General of Fars to the Shah at the beginning of the month, and by Qawam to the Prime Minister for -consideration by the Medjliss, but so far there had been no result. In view of the dissolution of the South Persia Rifles and of the spread of Russian influence in the north, Qawam, with whom the proposal originated, was seeking a means of saving the south from Bolshevism, and for some time had been strengthening his own position to^that end.Mr. Norman reported that he had suggested to the Inspector-General, as a reason for the final disbandment, that the proposal of the Persian Government offered no guarantee for the effective maintenance of a highly disciplined force in possession of a large quantity of munitions.The Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 385] on 26th September his approval of Mr. Normairs suggestion.The following message from the consular officer at Kerman was transmitted ;[No. 537] by Mi-. Norman on 28th September : -The spread of the news of the impending disbandment of the South Persia Rifles has caused disorders on a large scale in the province, which the Governor-General is powerless to check, owing to the small force maintained by him and the practical non-existence of Qara Suran, payment for which is shared by the Governor-General and the Head of the Department. Large robberies have taken place on the Yezd, Bunder-Abbas and Ehorassan roads, in which British subjects alone have lost over 37,000 tomans&apos; worth of goods. . Bands have appealed in the Sirjan and Khadri districts .and have looted several villages. The Governor-General is endeavouring to prevent reports of these.disorders reaching the capital.Mr. Norman added : The anticipated results of the dissolution of the South Persia Rifles are thus already beginning to appear.On 1st October Mr. Bridgeman, acting in the place of Mr. Norman, reported [No. 548] that when the latter took his leave of the President of the Council this Minister appealed to him that the Persian Government might be allowed to purchase rifles, guns and machine guns from the South Persia Rifles. The Persian Govern-ment was proposing to create a force from the disbanded South Persia Rifles for the purpose of preserving order in the Kerman and Fars districts, but no arms would be available if His Majesty&apos;s Government adhered to the instructions they had given. Mr. Bridgeman, in view of the situation, advocated compliance with the request, especially as purchase by the Persian Government would remove the risk of the last 1,600 rifles failing into less desirable hands.Mr. Bridgeman transmitted [Nos. 549 and 550] on 1st and 2nd October messages from the Inspector-General, strongly advocating the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-
merit. He reported that the disbandment so far had been carried out with unexpected, smoothness, and that the behaviour of the South Persia Rifles had been admirable. At the end of a difficult and unpleasant task, he would be grateful if His Majesty&apos;s Government would grant a concession which would permit British officers to leave the country with some gratitude and prestige.POLAND.Vilna. On 2nd October Mr. Max Muller reported [No. 395] from Warsaw that the question of Vilna had been discussed in the Diet the clay before. Telegraphing again [No. 39(i] on the same clay, he said : -The Diet confirms the resolutions previously passed that any decision as to the political status of the Viina district must be based on the will of the inhabitants. The Government is requested to draw attention abroad to the fact that Poland will neither conclude mor assent to any agreement which would dispose of the Vilna district without the consent of the population thereof having been previously obtained. This is the effect of the proposal of M. Hymans which was recommended by the League of Nations after Lithuania had rejected his first and equitable proposal which would have left the final decision to the inhabitants of Vilna, The Polish Government should, then, open negotiations on the basis of the first proposal. The Diet, knowing that the prolongation of the present provisional administration is harmful to the population of Vilna and a menace to Poland, is of opinion that it is impossible to prevent the convocation of the Diet of Vilna to determine the future of the country. ;PORTUGAL.Revolutionary Movement. The following telegram [No. 91] was sent from Lisbon by Sir Lancelot Carnegie on 2nd October: The Government have learnt that the revolutionary movement, about which rumours have been prevalent for some time, was arranged, to take place early on Saturday morning. Extensive military measures were taken and the movement completely collapsed, partly, it is said, owing to dissensions amongst the revolutionaries, none of whom seem to have been persons of any importance. The principal objects of the latter were to form a new extra-party Ministry, to have a fresh general election, and to amend the constitution, . All has been and is perfectly quiet.RUSSIA.Soviet Reply to British Note, On 30th September Mr. Hodgson reported [No. 87]: from Moscow that the reply of the Soviet Government to the note of the 7th September had been despatched by bag the day before and that the contents were as follows : Though the Commissary of Foreign Affairs realized on a cursory glance&apos;that the charges were unfounded or based on false information he refrained from the precedent of the Foreign Office in returniug the note and subjected it to a careful investigation.The reports and speeches quoted are inventions, and the conclusions drawn from them that it is the policy of the Russian Government, in collaboration with the third International, to undermine the influence of the British Government abroad are worthless.The fact that the third International lias its seat in Russia in no wise implicates the Russian Government in the activities of this organization any more than the presence of the second International in Brussels incriminates the Belgian Government. Neither Stalin nor Eliava were ever connected with the third International, The eastern section of the International ceased to exist in the autjiimn of 1920. Karakhan never made the report ascribed to him. Nuorteva has been in prison since March and no department of propaganda existed in June 1920. Lenin did not speak on 8th June.The various quotations in the note have appeared from time to time in the Russian counter-revolutionary papers. The Government, in endeavouring to trace the source of these and similar forgeries, traced them to a bulletin printed in Germany under the title of Ostinformation. The address of the printing works is A. Winser, Wilhelm-strasse II, Berlin, S.W. 48, and Bank&apos;s, Westerhagen-Potsdam Strasse 127, Berlin..
This bureau supplied secret information on Soviet Russia to various Governments. Sample photographs of its production are transmitted with the Soviet Governments reply, it is regretted that the British Government should have based charges against a friendly Government on documents issuing from this bureau. The apocryphal speeches, &amp;c, in the British note are repeated in the bulletin almost word for word. Had the Foreign Office realized the dubious source of its information, the Soviet Government is confident that the note never would have been sent.. The Soviet Government states most emphatically that since the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian agreement it has had no dealings, direct or indirect, with any Indian revolutionaries. No propaganda school exists in Tashkend for preparing emissaries for India. The Government has had no contact with Hafiz, nor has it any knowledge -of his present (? group omitted), hut the Indian who proposed to organize traffic in arms in Kabul has been arrested and is still in prison.&apos; The Government disclaims any responsibility for the actions of Jemal Pasha, to whom no assistance is being-given. The crossing of Russia by Indians on their way to Afghanistan does not violate the agreement any more than the hospitality extended in England to counter-revolutionaries. The Soviet Government lias not tried to prevent the Angora Government from coming to an agreement with Great Britain, nor. has it assembled forces on the Anatolian frontier. M. Chicherin himself brought the Angora Ambassador into contact with the British agent to allow a discussion of differences.Strict instructions were issued by the Soviet Government to its representatives, on the conclusion of the trade agreement, to adapt their activities to the new relation-ship between the two countries. It is believed that these instructions are being followed, and that the Russian representatives are confining themselves to the protection of Russian interests without infringing those of Great Britain. True to the principle of self-determination, Russia respects the independence of the eastern countries and is abandoning the privileges and concessions extorted by imperial Russia. Any help given to Afghanistan in accordance with a treaty brought to the knowledge of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Mr. Krassin cannot be construed as an unfriendly act. Rothstein has not set up a revolutionary committee or attempted to secure the dismissal of the Afghan representative, with whom he is on friendly terms.If the Russian representatives (? have) (two groups undecypherable) infringed British interests it is because these have not been defined. Repeated requests during the negotiations (one group undecypherable) agreement for full discussion of the contracting parties&apos; mutual obligations in order to prevent future misunderstandings were repulsed. The Russian Government has done its best to honour its under-takings and obviate causes of friction, but it could not prevent malefactors forging documents and deceiving His Majesty&apos;s Government; nor could it expect that the Foreign Office would use such documents in order to discredit it.The British attitude recently has been far from friendly witness the arrests in Constantinople, the co-operation with France on the Russian question, the support of French schemes tending to frustrate the famine relief, and the presentation of a note at a time when France was inciting Poland and Rumania to make war on Russia.His Majesty&apos;s Government is well aware of the readiness of the Russian Govern-ment to discuss in a friendly manner the means for removing hindrances to the re-establishment of normal relations. When, instead of resorting to baseless charges to impugn Russian good faith and deter other countriesLrom concluding agreements with Russia, England will show a similar disposition, she will find a ready response.Russo-Polish Relations.-On 30th September Mr. Hodgson telegraphed [No. 84] from Moscow as follows; -The period of acuteness in Russo-Polish relations seems to have passed. On 22nd September the Soviet Government, in reply to a Polish note of 18th September confirming the intention of withdrawing the Legation unless Russia fulfilled the conditions of the treaty of 1st October, reiterated its willingness to carry out its obligations, jprovicled that Poland dissolved the counter-revolutionary organizations and suggested that the term of the Polish ultimatum be extended to (? 5th October). On the night of 27th September the Polish Minister left for Warsaw. Poland on the same date presented a note couched in conciliatory language to the effect that: 1. The Polish Government is prepared to have documents purporting to establish Polish participation in the White movement submitted to the Polish law courts for examination. . .2. Measures have been taken to render innocuous the persons to whose presence in Poland exception is taken, but if the Russian Government can prove that the right 33-1&apos; C
10of refuge is being abused, Poland is ready to act under clause 5 of (? the Riga) treaty. The Russian objection to effecting payment by 1st October cannot therefore be maintained (group Undecipherable) inducing her to adopt an aggressive policy.3. The existence of any French note inciting Poland to aggression is denied. The only desire of Poland is to induce (? Russia) to fulfil her treaty obligations.4. It is hoped that the conciliatory disposition of Poland will be met by a corresponding attitude on the part of Russia, upon whose decision at the present time will depend in a large measure the development of further relations between the two States.SERBIA.Western Hungary. Mr. Strang sent the following telegram [No. 204] from Belgrade on 20th September: The Austrian Charge cVAffaires tells me that as far as he knows the Austrian Government has not made any official (? requests) to this Government that the Serbian occupation of villages in western Hungary should be maintained till the Austrian Government can take possession; but he says that when speaking of the subject at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he expressed the personal view that his Government (? would) rather that the Serbs stayed than that Hungary came in. He (? obtained) a written assurance that the Serbian authorities of occupation had not advanced from the 1919 line and that (? this) Government would conform to the decision of the commission of delimitation. In transmitting the assurance to Vienna he has suggested that the Serbs be asked to evacuate as soon as the Hungarians have left the comitats. but has not yet received instructions to this effect.The Tirana Government. On 1st October Mr. Strang reported [No. 210] that an official communique issued in Belgrade stated that, the Tirana Government having ordered a general mobilization and concentrated along the frontier and the demarcation line with a view to violating that line and to attacking the Serbian troops around Kljesh and Aias, the Serbian Government had found itself compelled to reinforce its frontier garrison in order to be ready for any eventuality and to guard against a surprise. Also that a further communique had stated that the Government possessed a document, emanating from the Albanian Minister of War, proving that an attack had been premeditated by the Tirana Government.TURKEY.Russian Refugees in Constantinople [F.C.R., hi, p. 81. The following telegram [No. 637] was sent from Constantinople by Sir Horace Rumbold on 27th September: An international relief committee for the Russian refugees in Constantinople has been formed here to take over from the American Red Cross their organization, offices, food stations, and such stock as they have left with a view to continuing as far as possible the work of the maintenance of the Russian refugees here. The work performed by the American Red Cross at Constantinople since the Crimean evacuation in November has involved an expenditure of over $10,000,000. And this expenditure has exhausted all the available funds of the American Red Cross.I have now ascertained that there are between 32,000 -and 33,000 Russian refugees in Constantinople and its surroundings ; and that 17,000 of this number are absolutely destitute; and that over 1,000 sleep in the streets. In November last the residents of Constantinople, principally the British community, raised a large sum of money for the relief of the Russian refugees. But the British community is incapable of any further big effort in this direction, owing to the fact that trade is practically non-existent.The international relief committee will, therefore, only be able to support an extremely limited number, and in view of the gravity of the problem, the committee have requested me to ascertain whether a grant in aid cannot be obtained from the allied Governments.   -Whilst a grant in aid would, of course, relieve the situation, it is only a temporary palliative, as these destitute Russian refugees will be an indefinite and continuing liability. It costs 11. a month at the present rate of exchange to feed one Russian refugee. For the above reasons it is suggested that the international relief committee which is to meet at Brussels on 6th October, should tackle the problem once and for
all. I need hardly emphasize the danger of the presence of 17,000 destitute Russians -to the security and health of this already overcrowded town.In the meantime, I have informed the committee that I doubted whether a grant ha aid could be obtained from the allied Governments.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The conference.-On 3rd October Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 635] from Washington that the United States Government had accepted the 2nd November as the date of the conference, and had proposed Rear-Admiral Nathan C. Twining as the senior representative, and Commander Andrew S. Hickey as the second representative.Relations ipith Greece. On 29th September Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 625] as follows ;- .   &apos;The Under Secretary of State said to-day that pressure was being brought to bear on the President to appoint a United States Minister at Athens.The United States Government had not wished to appoint a Minister until they were assured that the loans made by the United States to M. V.enizelos had been taken -over by King Constantine. They had now been practically assured that this had been done.The Under Secretary said that the State Department would like to have the views .of the British and French Governments as to the appointment of a United States Minister to Athens before nominating one.
