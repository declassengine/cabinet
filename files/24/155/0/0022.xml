FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ARABIA.King Hussein. The acting-agent at Jedclah telegraphed [Nos. 9 and 11] on 1st and 2nd February to the following effect :-In accordance with his instructions he had had a conversation with King Hussein, who had furnished a lengthy reply which was being sent by bag. It reasserted his old grievances and pressed for sympathetic treatment on the lines of his corre-spondence with Sir Henry McMahon. He declared that he would abdicate unless he received a categorical answer to his claims by 27th February. He denied the existence of any &quot;former pacts:and agreements,&quot; and stated that a reference thereto made the treaty Avorthless, dangerous and impossible to ratify. In any case the restriction of Idrisi and Ibn Saud to their pre-war authority and boundaries was a necessary condition for his ratification of the treaty. The refusal to permit the Emir Abdul!a&apos;s visit has made him very sore.BALTIC STATES.Proposed Conference with Poland. Mr. Wilton telegraphed [No. 10] from Riga as fellows on 6th February : \ The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me to-day that the Polish Government had invited Latvia, Esthonia and Finland to a conference at Warsaw to discuss subjects of joint interest preliminary to the Genoa conference. He thought Moscow was apprehensive that the object of the Warsaw conference was to conclude a military alliance aimed against Russia. He seemed to think that the tendency of the present Bolshevik step might induce Finland to seek an alliance.Lithuania.Recognition de jure by Hjzecho-SlovahiaOn 24th January Mr. Dilley reported [No. 6] from Kovno that on the previous day Lithuania had been recognized de jure by the Czecho-Slovak Republic.New Cabinet. On 1st February Mr. Dilley reported. [No. 10] from Kovno that a new Cabinet had been formed, and three days later [No. 12] that its composition wa&apos;s as follows: M. Galvaanskas       - - - Prime Minister.M. Yurgutis - -        -        - Foreign Affairs: -     .        . .   -M. Slizys     ---        - War.Ah Oleka     - Interior.M. Dobkevitch        -        -         . Finance.M. Aleksa    -        -        -        - Agriculture.M. Kadoblis ... Justice.M. Vileisis    -        -        -        - Communications.M. Juodakis -        -        -        - Education.M. Soloveichick       ... Jewish Affairs.In the earlier telegram he said that the only changes were in the ministries of war, education, the interior, and communications.Relations with Poland. Mr. Wilton telegraphed [No. 8] from Riga as follows on 28th January : -The Lithuanian minister has informed me that his Government has sent an official note to the Polish Government proposing direct negotiations. The basis of nego-tiations laid down in the note is recognition of the validity of the treaty, the annulment of the Vilua elections, and the temporary administration of the Vilua area under a joint agreement.I am inclined to regard the note as a move in political strategy, as it seems unlikely that Poland will return a favourable reply:- [See under &quot; Poland.&quot;]
oCHINA.Macao [F.C.R. lvi, p. 4]  The following telegram [No. 26] was sent by the. Foreign Office to Sir Beilby Alston at Peking on 24th January :  The Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Lisbon that pending reference to the League of Nations the Governments of Macao and Canton have practically agreed to endeavour to secure.a provisional arrangement by means of arbitration; the suggestion being that each Government should choose two arbitrators and that the Governor of the Philippines should be asked to be the fifth. The Portuguese Minister at Peking was to proceed to the Philippines to see the Governor.It is desirable that there should be nothing in the terms of any provisional arrangement which, might be taken to imply a formal recognition of the Canton Government,The Situation. Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed [No. 31] as follows on 26th January : -Wn-Sei-Fu has continued his attacks on the Premier and. induced the six northern and the central Yaug-tze provinces to join him in threatening to sever relations with the Cabinet if he remained Premier.The President finally granted Liang leave of absence on 21th January and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has reluctantly agreed to assume the duties of acting Premier from 27th January.Money for the Chinese new year Settlement on 28th January has beeh raised.On 2nd February he further reported [No. 30] : The situation in the southern and western provinces remains unchanged.Wu-Pei-Fu&apos;s open attack on Liang-shih-yi was ostensibly based on the pro-Japanese tendency of the 1&apos;atter&apos;s foreign policy, and was supported by the Governors of Shantung, Shensi, Honan, Hupei, Kiang-si; Kiang-su forced the new Premier to take sick leave (? on) 25th January. Chang-tso-lin has not yet accepted this (? challenge) from the Chih-li party.Financial negotiations with the consortium are suspended until the political situation clears : but the Chinese new year settlement was tided over by a loan from the native banks on the security of the surplus of the salt revenues.CZECHO-SLOYAKIA,Payment of British Debts [F.C.P, Ixi, p. 3]. The following telegram [No. 24] was sent from Prague by Mr. Cecil on 25th January: The bill which has now been altered to include a guarantee of the payment of debts to all the allied Powers in this country will be passed by Parliament on Saturday. The bill does not enter into details, but the Prime Minister has promised to give me a written interpretation, which he assures me will satisfy the conditions of the Board of Trade formula except that referring to debts contracted&apos; through Vienna. This latter condition is one which the Czecho-Slovak Government cannot accept.For political reasons Dr. Benes urges the importance of keeping the question of the settlement of pre-war debts separate from the loan negotiations. He could not get Parliaments assent to the bill if it was thought that after the sacrifices he has made in connexion with the Anglo-Czech Bank he was making further surrender.He is personally still determined to place his loan in London and, as he fully realizes the feeling in certain circles in England towards Czecho-Slovakia, isgbihg as far as he can to meet the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government. But I know he has received a tempting offer from America, which his opponents may well blame him- for not accepting.I venture to hope that the fact that the bill will be passed this session, and that the Prime Minister has given his assurance that it will be interpreted in such a manner as to satisfy the Board of Trade formula, except as regards debts contracted through Vienna, will be considered a sufficient guarantee to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to give their support to the loan negotiations.Telegraphing again [No. 31] on 31st January Mr. Cecil said :-Owing to technical difficulties and disturbances in Parliament it was&apos;impossible to pass the bill on Saturday and. it must now wait until next session.
I have received an official note from the Prime Minister the translation of which is as follows : -In view of the long negotiations concerning the question of British pre-war debts in this country and of the desequestration of our property in England I have the honour to communicate that the point of view of the Czecho-Slovak Government is the following : Animated by the keenest desire to solve the question of liquidation of pre-war credits and debts contracted by Czecho-Slovak subjects towards British subjects, the Czecho-Slovak Government submitted to the national assembly before the end of the winter session a draft law authorizing it not only to examine the whole question thoroughly but also to have legal power to act as guarantors for the Czecho-Slovak debt towards British creditors.For purely technical reasons it was impossible to have the law passed as the Government of the republic had wished, but it undertakes to submit to : and have passed by Parliament, at the next session, a new bill authorizing it to give State guarantees to British creditors for payment of the debts of Czecho-Slovak citizens contracted directly, without intermediaries, between - - the two parties before 28th October PJ18. &apos;The Government of the republic wishes to emphasize that it expects that the question of the qualification (nationality) of Czecho-Slovak subjects, whether creditors or debtors, will be settled by competent authorities on the basis of reciprocity.In the meantime the Government, according to the law voted in the last session of the assembly, will draw up a return of all credits and debts contracted prior to 28th October 1918 by Czecho-Slovak subjects and British . subjects.As this note did not appear to me to give the definite assurances in regard to the Board of Trade formula which the Prime Minister promised me (see my telegram No. 24), I saw his Excellency last night and urged him. to let me have a more detailed statement,   He repeated that (1) The question of State guarantee was now definitely assured, and that he had specifically secured the formal consent of the Ministry of Finance ;(2) The restrictions imposed by the bank \? officials) on the private settlement of pre war debts had already been removed ; and(3) He personally saw no objection to the five years&apos; limit, and that he hoped, after consulting with the Minister of Finance, to be able to give me a definite -assurance to-day on this point.Credit for Austria.-On 25th January Mr. Cecil reported [No. 25] that the Prime Minister had stated that he had the day before formally promised to grant Austria a credit of 500 million crowns even in the event of the collapse of the loan negotiations in London; and that the Austrian Charge d&apos;Affaires confirmed this to Mr. Lockhart.Recognition of Lithuania. See under &quot; Baltic States.&quot;GERMANY.New Foreign Minister. Telegraphing [Nos. 26a and 27] on 31st January and 1st February, Lord d&apos;Abernon reported that Herr Rathenau had been appointed Foreign Minister, and that his appointment had been well received by all parties, except the Volkspartei. The nationalist papers, though critical, were less hostile than might have been expected. The Volkspartei stated that they had supported the recent taxation compromise on the condition that they should be consulted regarding the vacancy in cabinet posts. As this had not been done, they regard themselves as free from their pledges regarding the compromise.GREECE.King Constantine. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 24] as follows on 26th January: The Oreek newspapers yesterday published a statement emanating from the London Daily Express to the effect that I had informed King Constantine that in the interests of Greece he must abdicate in favour of the Crown Prince.
Great excitement was caused and many newspaper correspondents came to the legation to enquire. I saw none, but caused them to be informed that there was not 41 word of truth in the statement.I saw the acting Prime Minister later in the day and he told me that he had just-received an urgent telegram from the Greek Minister at Bucharest stating&apos;that the ITavas agency had reported the statement and asked if it were  rue. .1. gave his Excellency the same answer as to the correspondents.I have not discussed the question of recognition of the King with anyone here except with my diplomatic colleagues as reported to you, and am inclined to think that the rumour must have been deliberately started by some French agency. The Daily Express is in close touch with Paris.I do not believe it is possible to instal the Crown Prince, and trust that the question may be settled at the forthcoming Paris meeting.Two days later he telegraphed again [No. 27] to the following effect: Two days ago a Venizelist newspaper office was broken up and petty persecutions still continue.The only argument likely to incline the Greek Government to show more energy in punishing offenders would be that failure to do so prejudices any chance King Constantino may have of being recognized by the Powers. I have not felt at liberty to use this argument because the Greek Government would be&apos; sure.to conclude from it that recognition was probable, and their papers would very likely publish next clay .a statement that I had already promised recognition.The uncertainty of the present situation is weighing on the whole country, and the editor of the paper mentioned in the first paragraph declared to me it was becoming intolerable and that he would prefer the recognition of King Constantine to its continuance.Crete. On 3rd February Mr. Lindley reported [No. 3-4] that the Minister of the Interior had left for Crete on the 2nd with instructions to get into touch with the insurgents and find out what they wanted, fie was to threaten to enforce the brigandage law if they should prove recalcitrant.The Army. On 3rd February Mr. Lindley also reported [No. 35] that a royal decree had just been issued calling up the 1910 and 1911 classes in Macedonia, Thrace, and the islands. He added that it was officially explained that this measure was not due to the situation in Asia Minor, but had been decided upon in order to equalize the military burden in old and new Greece for reasons of internal Order in Macedonia and Thrace.ITALY.The Ministerial Crisis. Sir Ronald Graham telegraphed [No. 40] as follows oh 3rd February: Although the Bonomi Government was not expected to last long, its sudden fall -came as a surprise. The reasons why the Giolitti party provoked the crisis remain obscure, as they are unlikely to be able to profit by it. It appears that Signor Giolitti himself was averse to such action but was over-persuaded by his followers; although without socialist support, and with the declared opposition of the catholics, there was little prospect of his being able to form a Government. Theposition of the Bonomi Government was always intrinsically weak, but it had secured several substantial majorities at the end of the last session, and nothing had happened since of a sufficiently grave nature to compromise its position. The chief criticisms against it have been in connexion with the handling of the iianco di Scon to incident, and its attitude on the death of the Pope, which has been considered too subservient to the catholics; but the present crisis has been provoked by the desire of certain sections of (group omitted) to obtain office. Their action has aroused general and strong resentment amongst all other parties, except the socialists, who are glad to see any Government fall.It is considered likely that as Signor Giolitti caused the crisis, the King will send for him to-morrow morning, but that he will probably refuse to attempt to form a Cabinet in view of catholic hostility. A Giolitti-Orlando combination is still talked -of, but suffers under the same disabilities. The catholic party still holds the,key to-thesituation. In the circumstances, the chances of Signor Ue Nicola, a young man of 42-who has never held ministerial office, but was Undersecretary of State for the Colonies and the Treasury, and has made a -considerable personal reputation as president -of the Chamber, are viewed, with favour. His political slate is clean, and he would be -acceptable to democrats, catholics, and socialists, The King sent for him when the. 37-2 &apos; b
-Giolitti Ministry fell in June last, but he then declined, to form a ministry, and it is feared that on this occasion he may pursue the same course. He is ambitious, but is believed to consider that his moment has not arrived. The partisans of Signer Nitti are active, but it is generally (&apos;? group omitted) that his prospects at this juncture are negligible.&quot;If Signor De Nicola fails there are chances of a reconstructed Bonomi Ministry either with Signor Bonomi himself remaining Premier, or under the presidency of Signor de Nava, Minister of the Treasury. The position of the Marquis dela Torretta has been shaken lately, and a change at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is in any case probable. A parliamentary candidate would be preferred, but there is none -forthcoming with suitable experience.Sigouri Romano Avezzano, late Ambassador at Washington, who is to be secretary-general at the Genoa conference, and even Signor De Martino are spoken of in connexion with the post.I do not consider the prospects of Genoa conference are compromised by the present crisis as all parties in Italy are in favour of its taking place, as arranged. I am informed by the Foreign Office that orders have been issued for all preparations in connexion with it to proceed as if nothing had happened.Telegraphing again [No. 44] on the following clay Sir Ronald said : The. ministerial crisis is still unsolved. In private conversation this evening the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he himself had every intention of leaving office. He was tired and disillusioned. He had been himself in favour of the Government facing the chamber, as a vote would have made the situation, clearer, but his colleagues had not accepted his view. He thought that the prospect of a Giolitti or Orlando ministry was remote for the reasons I reported yesterday. &apos; The chances of Signor De Nicola, were more favourable, and he could probably form a Government if willing to do so. Signor De Nicola had so far refused unless assured of socialist support, but up to the present uo satisfactory assurances on the subject could be obtained from the socialists. Failing Sigouri De Nicola a De Nava combination was possible but unlikely. His Excellency evidently considered a De Nicola Cabinet to be probable, and this is the view generally held to-night. Sigouri Romaperio Avezano is freely mentioned as the likely Minister for Foreign Affairs.I expressed in suitable, terms the regret which I was sure you would feel at losing the Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; co-operation. He replied that he had always been a firm partisan of a close understanding and co-operation with His Majesty/a Government. He believed that whoever succeeded him would follow the same policy as if was the only one consistent with Italian interests. As regards the Genoa conference, all shades of opinion in this country were in favour of it. Nor did he think that the present crisis, which was unlikely to last long, need entail postponement.- He added that the Italian Government desired to concert with us in resisting the French pretension that the programme of conference as drawn up at Cannes was not definite but only tentative. Pie had sent instructions to the Italian Ambassador in London on the subject.Telegraphing once more [No. .51] on 6th February he farther reported as follows : The King has charged Signor De Nicola with the task of forming a Government and the latter is now attempting to do so. fie ought to succeed as even the Right are believed to be favourable to him. The catholics might be content with less than five portfoliosj and the socialists should at any rate ^abstain from voting against him. In those circumstances he may be able to form a strong coalition Cabinet. Some of the better elements in the chamber desired the fall of the Bonomi Government in order that a stronger ministry might be in power at the time of the Genoa conference. No forecast can yet be made as to the composition of the ministry. Signor Schanzer, the Italian delegate at Washington, Signor De Martino and the Marquis lmperiali are mentioned as possible for the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs. The first nanmd is now the most fancied as the chambers favour the appointment of a parliamentarian rather than a diplomatist.Misurata. Telegraphing [Nos. 5 and 6] on. 26th and 2&quot;th January, Mr. Monahan reported from Tripoli that the port of Misurata had been occupied by a small Italian force which had left the former place on. 25th January.   There was no resistance.NETHERLANDS.Possessions in the Pacific. On 2nd February Mr. Balfour reported [No. 327] that to save time and insure delivery at the proper moment, the following telegram
Lad been addressed mutatis mutandis direct to His Majesty&apos;s representatives at the Hague and at Lisbon : In concert with your American, French and Japanese colleagues, you should make the following communication to the Netherlands Government on Saturday, 4th February: The British Empire has concluded on 13th December 1921 with the United States of America, franco and Japan, a treaty with a view to the preservation of general peace and the maintenance of their rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific ocean. They have agreed thereby as between themselves to respect their rights in relation to these possessions and dominions.The Netherlands not being signatory to the said treaty, and the Netherlands possessions in the&apos; region of the Pacific ocean therefore not being included in the agreement referred to, His Britannic .Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Government, anxious to forestall any conclusion contrary to the spirit of the treaty, desire to declare that it is finally resolved to respect the rights of the Netherlands in relation to her insular possessions in the region of the Pacific ocean.PERSIA.New Government [F.O.R., lxi, p. 6].-On 22nd January Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 47] as follows : The appointment of Mushir-ed-Dowleh to form a Government was approved unanimously by a meeting of the delegates of all parts in the Medjliss.I hear that there is a good deal of private talk amoug deputies respecting the desirability of coming to terms with Great Britain, and the temporary Regent designate called on me to express his great desire to encourage and facilitate the resumption of old friendly relations, and hopes that His Majesty&apos;s Government will help in this direction with a view to some honourable arrangement. I said that with any Government in office (one group undecipherable) which had an evident sincere desire for the closest relations, being themselves convinced that these were in Persia&apos;s own interests, I felt sure the horizon would become clearer.On the next day the composition of the new Government was telegraphed [No. 51] in the following message: The new Government presented itself last evening to the Medjliss and was given a vote of confidence.To be composed of: President of Council  and  Minister  of the Interior .   -        -        -        -   Mushir-ed-Dowleh.Foreign Affairs    .... - -   Hakim-ul-Mulk.War        -        -        -        -        -   Sardar Sepah.Justice-   -        -        -        -         -   Serdar Muazzam.Posts and Telegraphs      -       : -        -   Ittila-es-Sultaneh.Education - Nayer-ul-Mulk.Finance   - - - - -   Mudir-ul-Mulk, as acting Minister.Referring to the above, Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 53] on the same date the following :--The new Prime Minister in addressing the Medjliss outlined the foreign policy as follows: The continuance of friendly relations with all Powers, and especially the neighbouring ones, while safeguarding national interests and independence. As regards internal policy, the reform of all departments, especially that of finance, and to strengthen the Ministry of War. In general respects the same programms&apos;in principle as the preceding Government, as sanctioned by the Medjliss, whose approval will be sought if modifications in detail appear necessary. The declaration was well received.Commenting on the foregoing in a later telegram [No. 54] also dated 23rd January, Sir Percy Loraiiie expressed his belief in a serious effort on the part of the Persian Government to come to better terms with Great Britain. This was largely the result of a private conversation with the Minister of War, who had adopted a very conciliatory attitude, and had explained that, although he was not anti-Russian, he was entirely anti-Bolshevik, and thought that by maintaining relations with the Russians he could keep a better eye on them. At the same time he admitted that these relations had become less since the recovery of Gilan, which had been a severe blow to the Russians. Mtishir-ed-Dowleh, he said, had a reputation for honesty and intelligence, and was believed in by the Medjliss. In response, Sir Percy animadverted on the attitude of the late Government, and especially on its financial policy, emphasizing the necessity of settling old debts before new were contracted.
The Regent, Reza Khan, having formed the cabinet himself, apparently, wished to reach an understanding with us, and Sir Percy Loraine was hopeful as to the future.Telegraphing [No. 72] on 30th January, Sir Percy reported a long conversation with Mushir-ed-Dowleh, in which the latter had asseverated his sincere wish to-clear away past misunderstandings-and to establish friendly sympathy with His Majesty&apos;^ Government.American Altitude. Sir Percy Loraine sent the following telegram [No. G2] on. 24th January : -The United. States&apos;Charge d&apos;Affaires informs mo confidentially that, under telegraphic instructions, just received, from his Government he has addressed a communication to the following effect: The United States Government is deeply interested in the principle of the open door ; it will insist on this principle in negotiations with the British Government or any other Government; it attaches importances to the maintenance, for American interests in Persia, of the same oppor-tunities as those enjoyed by the interests of any other nation. I have replied that the declaration, will doubtless be agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have themselves frequently proclaimed and sustained the principle mentioned, even in cases where considerable British interests already existed. I enquired what are the negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government referred to, and remarked that insistence with His Majesty&apos;s Government on this principle resembles pushing an open door.POLAND.Relations with Lithuania. Mr. Max Muller telegraphed [No. 2] as follows on .1 st February : The Minister for Foreign Affairs, with whom I discussed the question of the Lithuanian note yesterday, told me that the proposal as couched was, as Mr. Wilton foresaw, entirely unacceptable to the Polish Government, The latter were, however, anxious not to miss the opportunity of direct negotiations and had replied to the Lithuanian overture in a most friendly spirit, The Minister for Foreign Affairs had given me copies of the notes exchanged.The Lithuanian note states that the Lithuanian Government, in spite of the regrettable decision of the League of Nations to abandon the question, are determined to arrive at a pacific solution, and therefore propose the opening of direct negotiations between the two Governments on a broad basis, comprising all the future relations of the two countries. They must, however, maintain a prote.-t against the Vilna elections and the system of violence under which they were held ; the Diet thus elected they regard as mill and void, and they refuse to recognise or deal with any authorities based on the results of the elections. The Vilna question is one for settlement between the Polish and Lithuanian Governments, though account might be taken of the wishes of the population expressed in a legal and acceptable manner. The opening of negotiations with the Polish Government pro-supposes the restoration of the former status quo in Vilna and the withdrawal of the Polish elements and the military south of the Suwalki line. The note finishes with an appeal to the Polish Government to open, direct negotiations on this basis in the name of the two countries and of humanity.The Polish reply, which is couched in friendly terms, begins with an expression of the desire cf the Polish Government to establish neighbourly relations with Lithuania and of gratification at the proposal of direct negotiations. After a reference to certain recommendatious of the League, the note expresses the willing-! ness oF the Polish Government to commence negotiations at once either at Vilna or Kovno, but, protests energetically against (? the strictures) passed on the Vilna. question and the Diet, in regard to which it explains the Polish point of view. The note suggests as subjects, in regard to which agreement is most urgently required :   diplomatic and consular relations, the regulation of passports and communications, navigation and postal, telegraphic, commercial and customs relations. The Polish Government are also ready to negotiate a commercial treaty. Finally, the note expresses the conviction that by these satisfactory good feeling can be most quickly re-established between the two countries and requests that a speedy reply be sent as to place, date and programme.\See under &quot; Baltic States.&quot;!
