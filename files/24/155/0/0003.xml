FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ARGENTINE.Labour Dispute. On 12th May Mr. Maeleay reported [No. 70] that all work in the port of Buenos Aires was still at a standstill, the efforts of Government to effect an amicable solution of the dispute having so far proved abortive. The solution had become more serious through the attitude of the federated port labourers, who had declared a strike and their intention to refuse to resume work until they had received a Government guarantee that no non-federated labour would be permitted in the port and docks.AUSTRIA.The Gendarmerie Question. On 11th May Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 124] as follows :         ,The president of the police has just called to make a last appeal concerning the excess gendarmerie and police. This is the first time I have discussed the question with any Austrian official.The present position of the army is that, the Government, by stopping recruiting and encouraging undesirables to leave, have reduced the actual effectives to about 16,000 men. They have only been able to do this by acting quietly, without giving the Social Democrats any opportunity of openly resisting the diminution of what they consider their army.Mr. Schober declared that the Government felt quite unable to propose the incorporation of the excess gendarmerie with the army because the Social Democrats would at once offer to fill up the ranks with their own people and were quite capable of raising men.The Austrian Government, therefore, if forced to choose, would choose to reduce the gendarmerie and the police. The numbers of these forces were already inadequate to fulfil the duties caused by the situation, which was entirely different from that existing in 1913, and Mr. Schober did not see how he could with, a reduced force be responsible for the maintenance (? of order).. He did not threaten - to resign, because he is not the man to try to bring pressure to bear by such means.I entirely agree with Mr. Schober in his appreciation of the situation.BULGARIA.Serbian Accusations. On 14th May Sir Arthur Peel telegraphed [No. 70] as follows: The Minister for Foreign Affairs has addressed a circular note to the allied and associated representatives in reference to accusations in the Serbian press of Bulgarian comitadji activities in Serb-Groat-Slovene territory, and to numerous (? threats) of rigorous sanctions against this country, one Serb-Croat-Slovene journal even urging a modification of the frontier established by the treaty.The Bulgarian Government state that the whole country is in the greatest alarm at the prospect of sanctions, and urge the formation of an international commission to inquire into all points at issue and decide whether the Bulgarian Government are acting in good faith.My United States colleague is also telegraphing to his Government the substance of the note in question, which, it should be pointed out, is based on Serb-Croat-Slovene newspaper comments only.1 should mention that reports of this nature are being received in Sofia daily.ESTHONIA.Meeting of Foreign Ministers. See under &apos;-&apos; Lithuania.&quot;
o of inland.   &apos;The Aland Islands-Telegraphing [No. 94] from Helsingfors &quot;on 17th May-Mr. Russell reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had expressed satisfaction -at the general terms of the report of the rapporteurs, but had misgivings at the -suggestion that the Finnish Government should.grant the general council, of the Aland Islands the right of direct recourse to the&apos;Council- of the League of Nations, which,he feared might give rise to frequent vexatious appeals. Mr. Russell added that the report had been favourably received by the press,- with, however, some reservations regarding the guarantees.GERMANY.New Ministry. On 11th May Lord IVAbernon telegraphed [No. 211] this list of ;the new Ministers :  :Chancellor: Dr. Wirth, who is provisionally entrusted with the Ministry forForeign Affairs. Vice-Chancellor and Exchequer : Herr BauCr. Interior : Herr Grandnauer. Economics: Herr Schmidt, * Justice : Herr Schiffer. - /Army: Herr Gessler. Post Office : Herr Giesberts. Communications: Herr Groener. Labour : Herr Braims. Food : Herr Hermes.Of the above, the following four are members of the centre party : Wirth, Giesbefts, Hermes, Brauns; the following three belong to the democratic party : Gessler, Groener, :Schiffer;  and the following three to the  majority socialists: Bauer, Schmidt, Grandnauer.Reparation. -On 17th May! Lord D&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No number] the following summary of an interview given by the Chancellor to the editor: of --Oer mania :  &apos;.We have said yes. It was a sincere and honourable yes. AVe do not attach -to it any condition in the sense of formal interpretations which could in any Avay 6 limit the sincerity of the yes. Therefore I do not speak of conditions. I will do everything in my power to cause disarmament and delivery of material as welTas of money to be carried out as soon as possible, and I hope that in the coming week proofs will be forthcoming that will show the Allies that we are not playing with words but are ready to proceed to deeds as far as lies in our power. Our yes has, I believe, brought about a great detente, in the international situation. Please God, we may soon be able to say in the world : &quot; Put. aside ihe gun and return to the plough and anvil.&quot;Upper Silesia.Note from Lord Carson. On 8th May Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 231] to Lord Hardiuge as follcwrs: I fear that it is impossible to absolve the Polish Government from, at any rate, partial responsibility lor the present untoward events in Upper Silesia, both.as regards their genesis and their actual course. Korfanty has placed himself at the head of the insurgents, has defied the inter-allied Commission, and has proclaimed that the Polish party will submit to be shot down to a man by the allied troops rather than bow to the deoisionsof the allied GoverniTients hi accordance with the treaty, and will destroy the mines and foundries first. It. is true that the Polish &quot;Government have disavowed him, but, having strenuously opposed our previous attempts to secure his removal, which we had urged for the very reason that he was organizing an insurrectionary movement, they cannot escape responsibility for that movement so organized, now it has broken out.Moreover, the information which we are receiving contains abundant evidence that the movement is not only well supplied with material from Poland, but is actively supported - by regular Polish military formations.   I cannot believe that the Polish
4Government did not dispose of adequate forces to stop this by closing, the frontier, as--the Commission had consistently urged, had they wished to do so.A clear and immediate communication on the above lines from the allied; Governments to the Polish Government seems necessary at this stage. It would possibly have some practical effect if they were at the same time told, not merely that the allied Governments will hold them responsible on these grounds, but that, if the-movement under Korfanty&apos;s leadership results in serious damage to&apos;mines and other-German property in the industrial, area, by flooding or otherwise, the question of&quot; mating compensation to Germany from those districts in which there has been an, overwhelming Polish vote will necessarily require consideration when the frontier is fixed. An attempt, passively allowed, even if not directly encouraged, by the Polish&apos; Government, forcibly to frustrate the operation of the treaty, may wrell introduce a new factor which must weigh with the allied Governments when reaching their decision on the results of the plebiscite.Please make proposals as above to Ambassadors&apos; Conference without delay.Air. Lloyd George&apos;.s Speech. On 15th May Mr. Max Muller telegraphed [Nos. 253,. 254] from Warsaw, saying that he had received a note from the Polish Government regarding the speech pronounced by the Prime Minister on 13th May in the House of Commons.After saying that they reserved the right to revert later to other questions -and. notably to that of the attitude of the Polish Government raised by the speech, they had called his attention to a passage in which Mr. Lloyd George w7as reported te have said; that he saw no objection to Germany herself restoring order in one of her provinces. The note pointed out that according to article 88 of the treaty of Versailles (a treaty which the Poles were determined to respect) and its annexe, Upper Silesia, the fate-of which was to be decided by the &quot;result of a vote determined by communes accord--ing to the majority of votes in each commune,&quot; could not be regarded as a German province seeing that the plebiscite area was under the control of an inter-allied, commission.   As Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s utterance could not fail to rouse great excitement-in Poland, it was of the utmost importance that the Polish Government should be in a position to obviate the dangers which might arise from an incorrect interpretation of his words, and they therefore requested the British legation in Poland to furnish them-with the necessary explanations with as little delay as possible.. Such explanations -appeared to the Polish Government all the more called for.as, if Mr. Lloyd GeorgeV words had the meaning which at first sight they appeared to bear, they had not only&apos; ,   emphasized, but also gravely\ggravated the menace to the peace of Europe to which the legation note of 10th May called attention, and the existence of which had been confirmed by reliable information of German military preparations on the Upper-Silesian frontier.After asking for instructions Mr. Max Muller went on to say that he did not feel sure that sufficient allowance had. been made for the difficulties of the Government to which he was accredited.   In his opinion there was not a shadow of doubt that the Erench had for some time past intended that Korfanty&apos;s coup should coincide with their own march into the Ruhr district.   It was not surprising that the Polish Government should have made no attempt to interfere with the preparations for the-rising in view of the French attitude and of the knowledge that the British and Italian Commissions had recommended giving the industrial triangle to Germany,, knowledge presumably clue to the deliberate indiscretion of the French.    The Government admits that it was not strong enough when the rising occurred, and the-whole situation had been changed by the German acceptance of the ultimatum to take vigorous measures to effectively close the frontier immediately.   Now according to its-repeated assurances it intends to make its measures effective, and it thinks that it has. the internal situation well in hand. It is, however, to be feared that nothing could prevent the intervention of the Polish army if the Germans should march into Upper Silesia.If the blames is to be apportioned the fact cannot be overlooked that if we had. &apos; been in a position to fulfil our obligations the rising would have been promptly -suppressed if, which is unlikely, it had occurred ;   but the French are mainly responsible.Influx of Germans. On 15th May Colonel Percival reported [No. 108 ?] that it. was clear to him that large numbers of Germans were flocking to Upper Silesia from every part of Germany to take up arms against the Poles.   Every class of person was represented, and, unless the German leaders there  were  able-to exercise control over them,  Upper Silesia would   be  overrun by a horde-
of irresponsible armed bands. He had sent for one of the German leaders, and informed him that he was aware- that these bands were forming; drawing his attention to the danger of allowing them to remain uncontrolled. He had at once admitted, but did not acknowledge any responsibility for, that state of things, and had also agreed that every effort should be made to get these bands under control. He thought, however, that a German leader would make his appearance and act on the same lines as Korfanty, that- is to say, occupy &quot;the country without taking (group omitted) against the allied troops and the Commission. No doubt a considerable number of these men might be dealt with by enlisting them in the police force, but the French would never countenance that being clone.GREECE.Press Campaign against France. On 6th May Lord Granville reported [No. 225] that the campaign against France in the government press was exceeding all bounds; the Veuizelist and independent papers had expressed strong disapproval, and referred to all that France had clone for Greece, but this had only incited the government press to more violence. He had mentioned the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, pointing out the folly of thus irritating France; and the Minister had replied that the Government heartily disapproved of the campaign, which was most inconvenient to them, but that the liberty of the press was one of the first principles in Greece, and their attempt to persuade these journalists to be more moderate had met with no success.One of the Yenizelist papers had suggested that the campaign against France was got up to draw off public attention from the failures of the Government and to propagate the idea that present difficulties were all clue to M. Venizelos and his foreign allies having landed Greece in an impossible position from which the present Government might have to extricate her by withdrawal from Asia Minor.&apos; General Papoulas&apos;s Order [F.C.R., xlii, p. 6].  On 7th May Lord Granville reported [No. 227] that he had spoken to the Minister of Foreign Affairs about General Papoulas&apos;s order, and that the Minister had said that as soon as he saw a report of this &quot;blockade&quot; he had taken on himself to have instructions telegraphed to the Greek navy not to act on it, and this morning had telegraphed to M. Gounaris asking for an explanation. The Minister had read to him the latter&apos;s reply, which declared that there had been a complete misunderstanding; that there had been no: intention whatever to impose blockade of any sort; and that all ships were perfectly free to call at any ports in the area in ciuestion and to load or discharge cargo. The only measure taken was a strict police one to guard against espionage, and it had been laid down that no person might land in the area affected without a passport visa by the military mission at Constantinople and that no person might embark without a visa of the Greek military authorities of the area.Sir Horace Rum bold had already reported [No. 329] from Constantinople on the previous clay that the Greek Senior Naval Officer had notified Admiral Webb that he had received instructions from his Government not to act on General Papoulas&apos;s blockade order pendiug further instructions.Offers of Loans. On 12th May Lord Granville reported [No. 243] that according to press reports three offers of loans had been made to Greece: One by a Dutch group for some 20,000,0001 on the security of the tobacco monopoly ; the second by a British syndicate represented by Admiral Mark Kerr ; and the third by an American syndicate, represented by an American Greek, for a much larger sum on the security of (? 50 years) tobacco monopoly, the management of the currant trade, and the exploitation of Greek water power. Lord Granville added that Admiral Kerr had informed him that he hoped to help the Greek Government to secure a loan of some two million pounds in&apos;(? Holland).Regulation of Exchange.  Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 245] from Athens on 13th May that a, Government bill with the object of regulating exchange and preventing speculation had been read for the first time on the previous clay. The proposal is to form a consortium of all bankers possessing foreign exchange, who are each to deposit in proportion to form a capital which is expected to be at least one million sterling. This will be arranged by a committee representing the bankers and no exchange can be bought or sold above a limited sum without the committee&apos;s. consent.I gather that the financial circles think that this may check speculation to a certain extent, but do not expect much practical benefit. 28-3 B
LITHUANIA.Meeting of Foreign Ministers^ Mr. Wilton reported [No. 43] from Kovno on 17th May that, on 3rd June, there would be a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania at Riga. He understood that the first and the last-mentioned would urge the advisability of the three states concluding a military convention ; also that an economic convention and a common foreign policy towards Russia and Germany formed part of the programme of the conference.PANAMA.Relations with tile United States of America. On 3rd May Mr. Graham&apos;, telegraphed [No. 22] from Panama as follows :  The United States Government have presented, through their legation in this city, a reply to the Panama Governments note dated 18th March, in which they repudiate the contention that the United States&apos; obligations towards Panama (? embrace) an obligation to support any claims to adjoining territory regardless of the opinion of the United States regarding their validity and justice.The note acids that the claim of Panama to unchallenged occupation of the disputed territory since the colonial days does not entitle her to remain in occupation: of territory conclusively adjudged to Costa Rica.The White boundary line must be respected, and unless the disputed territory is given to Costa Rica within a reasonable time &quot; the Government of United States will be compelled to proceed in a manner to assure itself that the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriately transferred, and that the Pacific boundary as defined by President Lou bet, and the Atlantic boundary as determined by Chief Justice White, is specifically laid down.&quot; The note ends by stating that the &quot;United States feels obliged to communicate to Panama this determination,&quot; but that it is the result of careful and friendly deliberation.PERSIA.South Persia Rifles [F.C.R., xl., p. 7]. On 9th May Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 282] that the Persian Government had orally pronounced that they would take over the South Persia Rifles on 1st June. Although this force would be included in the gendarmerie, it would be under the distinct command of British officers, who would be stationed at Ispahan, for choice, and would be directly under the Minister of War or the Minister of the Interior. The Inspector-General would proceed with the scheme of reorganization. Such British officers and non-commissioned officers as would not have employment provided for them under the scheme could go back to India as soon as their services could be dispensed with. The same applied to Indian ranks.The Persian Government, having no money for the purchase of arms and equipment, had expressed the hope that the Indian Government would allow these to be handed over without payment. Mr. Norman advocated this, or at least that only a small charge be made on credit, because of the cost to India which would be entailed by the necessary destruction of some and the transport to India of the remainder, if the Persian Government did not take over the South Persia Rifles.Russian Attitude [F.C.R., xlii., p. 9].-Mr. Norman transmitted [No. 2S8] on 12th May the following telegram received from Kasvin, and dated 8th May: The Bolshevik consul-general, named Ilya Levin, accompanied by a female &quot; typist,&quot; has arrived via, Menjil and left co-day at noon for Teheran. His military attache, now at Menjil, is expected later to-day.He informed the Governor that he had been IS years in England. He claimed that Russia had prevented England from absorbing Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan, and warned him that British advisers would do Persia no good, and suggested that &apos; graduates of Bolshevik administrative schools should be employed. He said he was going to bring a large sum of money for the &quot; Persian National Bank.&quot; -LATVIA.Meeting of Foreign Ministers. See below, under &quot;Lithuania.&quot;
RUSSIA.Relations with the United Slates of America. The following wireless message was sent to M. Chicherin by M. Fridtjof Nausen from Christiania on 13th May :-Having sent the American Government your telegram, I have now received tire following answer: The Government of the United States appreciate very highly your friendly and humanitarian activity on behalf of the American citizens imprisoned or detained in Soviet Russia, and asks that you will continue to do everything possible to obtain their release or the amelioration of their conditions pending release. Any suggestions from you concerning the most efficacious methods of procedure will be welcomed. A condition precedent to any communication of any nature whatsoever between this Government and those who are responsible for the detention and imprisonment of the American citizens in Soviet Russia is the sale delivery of these citizens into friendly hands beyond the Soviet borders. (Signed) Ciiahles E. Hughes.From other sources I am informed that public feeling in the United States is growing more and more hostile towards the Soviet Government owing to the detention and imprisonment of American citizens in Russia, and I fear it may lead to serious consequences if allowed to go on. I have several times urgently suggested the American Government to negotiate direct with the representatives of the Soviet Government, but they have repeatedly answered that under present circumstances this is impossible. My opinion is that the situation would be materially improved by the immediate release of Americans in Russia, and it would show American people that you do not desire to use prisoners for political purposes. If you so desire, I will -do my best to carry out any wishes regarding repatriation of Russians in America or any other suggestions you may make.To this M. Chicherin replied as follows on 15th May :-Answering your wireless message of 13th May. are we to understand that the detention of American citizens in Russia is the only hindrance to the resumption of trade and de facto relations between Russia and the United States of America ?SWEDEN.The Aland Islands. Mr. Barclay telegraphed [No. 85]  as follows  on 11thMay:-The official summary of the rapporteurs&apos; recommendations respecting the Aland Islands is published this morning. The press criticizes them as illogical and -opportunist. Exception is chiefly taken to the appeal to Sweden to show her magnanimity by counselling moderation to the Alanders. The guarantees are considered to be worthless, and the general opinion is that Sweden cannot fail to continue to support the Alanders.The Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me that he considers the recommendations unfair and very unsatisfacteuy. In his opinion the premises on which they are based are distinctly weak. He cannot understand why the fact that Finland repelled the Bolsheviks should be a ground for&apos; attributing the islands to her. The Swedish Government will enter a strong protest against findings of the rapporteurs.The Swedish. Ministers in London and Paris, who are the delegates representing Sweden before the Council of the League of Nations, are on their way here with a view to assistance in drafting the protest.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Message from the Allied Conference. On 4th May Lord Curzon transmitted [No. 257] the following message from the Prime Minister to the United States ^Government: As President of the Allied Conference, which is just completing its sittings in London, I am authorized, with the unanimous concurrence of all the Powers here represented, to express to the United States Government our feeling that the settle-men t of the international difficulties in which the &quot;world is still involved would be -materially assisted by the co-operation of the United States; and I am therefore to
inquire whether that Government is disposed to be represented in future, as it was at an earlier date, at the allied conferences, wherever they may meet at the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, which sits at lJaris, and on the Reparations Commission.We are united in feeling that American cognizance of our proceedings, and,., where possible, American participation in them, will be best facilitated by this procedure.In reply to this the following message was transmitted [No. 307] by Sir Auckland Geddes on 7th May :  The Government of the United States has received through the British Ambassador the courteous communication in which you state that, with the-unanimous coEcurreuce of the Powers represented at the Allied Conference in London, you are to inquire whether this Government is disposed to be represented in the future, as it was in the past, at allied conferences, at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, and on the Reparation Commission.The Government of the United States, while maintaining the traditional policy of abstention from participation in matters of distinctly European concern, is deeply interested in the proper economic adjustments and in the just settlement of the-matters of world-wide importance which are under discussion in these conferences, and desires helpfully to co-operate in the deliberations upon these questions.Mr. George Harvey, appointed Ambassador to Great Britain, will be instructed, on his arrival in England, to take part as the representative of the President of the-United States in the deliberations of the Supreme Council. The American Ambassador to France will be instructed to resume his place as unofficial observer on the Conference of Ambassadors, and Mr. Roland W. Boyden will be instructed to sit again in an unofficial capacity on the Reparation Commission.The Government of the United States notes with pleasure your expression of the belief of the representatives of the allied Governments assembled in London that American co-operation in the settlement of the great international questions growing-out of the world-war will be of materiaL assistance.Sir Auckland added that in handing him the reply the Secretary of State had taken the opportunity of saying that he was extremely pleased to be able to inform-him that the President had wholeheartedly endorsed his recommendation that the-. United States Government should be represented on all the allied bodies.As a consequence of this exchange of messages, Lord Hardinge telegraphed&apos; &quot;[No. 260] on 9th May that the United States Ambassador had that day resumed his-attendance at the Ambassadors&apos; Conference. - -
