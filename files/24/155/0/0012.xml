FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ALBANIA.Serbian Action. Telegraphing&quot; from Valona on 19th September, Mr. Eyres reported [No. 32] that he had just returned from the Drin frontier, where all was quiet except for casual machine gam bombardment by the Serbs. The previous clay the Serbian commander had presented an ultimatum for the immediate evacuation of Aras, &amp;c, and the mountain of Luria, which would lay Mirditia at their mercy. This outrageous proposition having been refused, a heavy bombardment had begun the same evening.ARABIA.Aeroplanes.-On 6th September Mr. Marshall reported [No. 76] the landing of six Italian aeroplanes at Jeddah, adding that he thought King Hussein intended to use them in his attempt to re-occupy Khurma. Four days later Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 3] to Colonel Lawrence asking whether these aeroplanes had been paid for, and, if so, how the King had paid for them. At the same time Colonel Lawrence was instructed to do what he could to dissuade the King from organizing an expedition to Khurma and also from establishing an aerodrome at Taif. .In reply, Colonel Lawrence sent the following telegram [No. 20] on 13th September : King Hussein, paid for his 10 aeroplanes in cash from the Hejaz revenue, which this year will amount to about 320,000L The six Italian machines were ordered to spite us when we refused the export licence for four British. One has been assembled and has twice failed to reach Taif.The pilot is leaving the country and King Hussein (? is) sick at having, paid 2,500Z. for such rubbish. 1 believe that two (? pilots) and two mechanics, all British, are being sent to operate our machines.A landing ground has been prepared, at Mecca and at (? Taif), where I fear tribal conditions fully justify Ali&apos;s determination to show his aeroplanes. In accordance with your telegram, I will ask him not to, but his refusal will be probably prudent; I think he can be persuaded not to allow flight beyond (? Taif). Ibn Saud might be informed that they have no&apos;unachine-guns or bombs. I am also getting Ali to put off Khurma, since he has sent me documentary evidence that Tarabaranyabisha belonged to the Turkish Hejaz, and. he will wait for Ibn Saud&apos;s reply. The present situation is intolerable, and must be regulate(ed) somehow.[See under &quot; Italy.&quot;]ARGENTINE.Mr. Ginnell [F.C.R., li, p. 2].-Telegraphing [No. 147] on -17th September. Mr. Macleay reported that Irish bonds were to be printed up to the value of $7,000,000, and that the order for engraving them had been transferred to another firm by Mr. Ginnell. The text was to be- in Spanish. The bonds could not be lawfully placed on the market in the Argentine as they would not bear the statement, that they were issued under the authority of the Argentine Government. Mr. Ginnell had given as references the Banco Aleman Transatlantico in Buenos Aires and the National City Bank of New York; he had also informed the engravers that he was acting on the authority of the president of the Irish republic, and that the Argentine . Government had nothing to do with the bonds. Mr. Macleay added that, should he have proof of the bonds being exchanged for cash he proposed to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had assured him that he had informed Mr. Ginnell that he would not be allowed to raise a loan.CHINA.Tibet. The following telegram [No. 355] was sent from Peking by Sir Beilby Alston on 8th September : At his weekly reception yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the resumption of the Tibetan negotiations
had received the careful consideration of the Chinese Government. His colleagues were as anxious as himself for a settlement, but it did&apos; not seem possible to negotiate either here or in London at the present moment. If he went to Washington, as appeared probable, he would have to start in about three weeks. ..Dr. Koo was in Geneva and would later be going to Washington.Apart from the question of negotiators, he did not see how the Chinese Govern-ment could deal with the question when Szechuen and Yunan were not (? within -their) control.   Furthermore, the Chinese Government at the present time was far from beiug as strong as it was in the time of Yuan-Shih-Kai and Tuan-Chi Li, and &apos; yet under neither of those strong men had it been possible to reach a settlement.   It&apos; was a big question, and it appeared to him and his colleagues that to attempt to settle it now might be to the disadvantage not only of China, but of Great Britain. The negotiations themselves would put an additional weapon into the hands of the opponents of the Government, with the likely result that the latter would be turned out.   His Excellency contrasted this action with, the frequent affirmation of a desire on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government for a strong and united China and their&apos; avowed intentions to assist Peking to that end. Incidentally (apparently oblivious for the moment of Tibet) his Excellency remarked that the Government was in consider-, able difficulties : there had been difficulty in inducing the Premier to stay; in three or four weeks there might be a change of Government. ..This likewise made the time inopportune for negotiations.   I pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that all that he said showed how regrettable it was that no attention had been paid to our frequent suggestions for resuming negotiations when these difficulties had not. been present; His Majesty&apos;s Government had always been anxious for a settlement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs repeated that the Chinese Government had also been eager when the time was opportune.   His Excellency again asked why it was that His Majesty&apos;s Government were so urgent for a settlement now.   I repeated the explanation that Mr. Bell was about to leave Lassa, and that they wished to know definitely what the future position was before he left.   His Majesty&apos;s Government had waited for years and did not propose to wait indefinitely.The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and I would view sympathetically the position in which China found herself. Her relations with Great Britain were never better and Tibet was the only bone of contention, which he was sure he and I. could settle at an&apos; opportune moment. I said I appreciated and sympathized in China&apos;s difficulties and would inform your Lordship of the answer which his Excellency had given me, but I felt obliged to warn him that His Majesty&apos;s Government might consider themselves free to make such arrangements with the Tibetan Government as they thought fit and to ask for a written guarantee against encroachment on the frontier.In reply to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy&apos;s enquiry his Excellency said that he had received a further telegram from the Chinese Minister in London and that it corroborated all that I had said to him last week. I presumed that he was telegraphing to London the purport of the reply which he had now given me, and he said he would do so, but doubted whether the Charge d&apos;Affaires would be able to represent it adequately in Dr. Koo&apos;s absence.GERMANY.Resignation of the Bavarian Prime Minister.  On 11th September Mr. Seeds reported [No. -29] from Munich that the Prime Ministers obstinacy in the face of the Berlin Governments demands, had lost him the support of all the coalition parties except the Middle (V Nationalist) party, and that he had therefore resigned, together with the Minister of Justice, who represented the last-mentioned party.GREECE.Southern Albania. The following telegram [No. 485] was sent by Lord Granville on 7th September : I told the President of the Council this morning that I had heard rumours of a possible intention to take possession by a coup de main of the disputed territories in southern Albania; I said I had no positive information as to the state of the discussion by-the Conference of Ambassadors, but I pointed out that any such action, would certainly have the worst possible effect on the Powers, and would prejudice them against Greece.   He assured me that there was no truth whatever in the
Tumours in question, of the existence of which he seemed to he aware; that the Greek Government were continuing 10 do all in their power to restrain the inhabitants of those territories and their sympathizers, and that they were confident of being able to keep them quiet unless and until an adverse decision were to be taken by the Powers ; in that case he&quot; had uot the least hope of being able to prevent a rising of the Greek inhabitants with the assistance of the extremely numerous natives of those parts settled in Greece. In 1913 the Greek Government had done its utmost tq prevent a rising.and had. utterly failed; iioav it would be even more difficult, as everybody in Greece: and Epirus had been convinced that the question was actually and definitely settled in their favour, and it was even less possible now than it was then for a. Greek to be prepared to become a subject of Albania, as at that time there was some hope of Albania becoming, a properly organized state, whereas now such a hope had proved to be an illusion, as Albania was more hopelessly disunited than ever, and there were no signs of any real or general national feeling. When I pressed him, &apos;M. Gounaris assured me that the Greek Government would not encourage a rising even in the case of an adverse decision, but he admitted the possibility of their beng forced by an overwhelming public opinion to give eventual assistance and save, their compatriots from being massacred by the Albanians.Advance on Angora checked. On 16th September Lord Granville reported [No. 493] that he had been informed that the Government had decided to abandon the advance on Angora on account of the waste of life which the advance would entail.Telegraphing again [No. 497] on the following clay, he further reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had confirmed the decision to give up the advance to Angora, and to retire to a suitable position, which he had assured him had not yet-been selected.He, Lord Granville, had asked whether there was not some foundation.at least for the Turkish claim of a great victory, and had been assured&apos;that every communique issued tp the press by the commander-in-chief had been the exact repetition of the cyphered communique 24 hours earlier to the Government, and that the Turkish claims were therefore entirely unfounded. The Minister had added that according to the general staff the Greek losses did not exceed 14,000.On 18th September, however, Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 620] as follows from Constantinople : It is now proved that the Greek advance on Angora has been definitely checked. General Papoulas admits having encountered a stronger resistance than he expected, and has withdrawn to the west of Sakharia.The British military authorities inform me that everything indicates a Greek retirement to the. Eskishehr line for the winter. The Turks appear, however, to be working round both flanks, and it remains to be seen whether this retirement can be carried out in good order. JThe Greek troops have fought remarkably well, in spite of heavy losses, hut the morale of their staff appears to be shaken.HUNGARY.Tlte Western Zone.-On 10th September Mr. Hohler reported [No. 260] that the following telegram had been despatched by [? the diplomatic body] to the conference: In view of the serious nature of the situation and the failure of the methods hitherto employed, the Hungarian Government has proposed that the western zone should be cleared by the Hungarian gendarmerie, who would advance to the old frontier, capture the bands, and return within four days. We beg you to accept, if the Hungarian Government, will give formal and public, guarantees. It may be risky, but it seems the only solution, as an advance by the Austrian army would almost certainly provoke hostilities with the Hungarian army. The generals consider tins scheme the only feasible one, and we request instructions whether we may be authorized to give Hungary the mandate to restore order on the condition that she guarantees to withdraw her gendarmes within four days. We would point out that, the Austrian Chancellor having informed the generals that he is withdrawing the Austrian gendarmes, the territory will be utterly without a police force unless Hungary occupies it.
ITALY.Aeroplanes, for Hejaz. [See under &quot;Arabia.&quot;] On lOtb September Lord Curzon sent Mr. Kennard the following telegram [No. 391] in regard to the supplying of Italian aeroplanes to the Hejaz : We presume the aeroplanes were not Italian Government property, and that the pilot, and mechanic are not in the Italian Air Force, but that the Italian Government are able to control the export of aeroplanes by the issue of licences. Since the Hejaz is an independent state and consignment to a government which is signatory of the Arms Traffic Convention is permissible even in &quot;prohibited areas, we are not on strong ground in making representations to the Italian Government, more especially as we have ourselves recently agreed to the export, under licence, of four aeroplanes from Egypt to King&apos;Hussein. The latter were, however, of indifferent quality, and had been bought when the licence was applied for.You should, however,&apos; represent to the Italian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel sure that, from their experience in Tripoli, the Italian Government will,appreciate the danger of allowing excessive armaments to fall into the hands of Arab rulers at a time when, as a result of the war, there&apos;is no lack of arms in these areas. Though His Majesty&apos;s Government were themselves forced during the war to supply arms to the Arabs, and have recently found it necessary to allow the export of four aeroplanes under the above-mentioned special circumstances, they are anxious to do all they can to control the traffic in armaments of any kind. In the present case there is a real danger of the arrival of these aeroplanes leading to trouble with the neighbouring rulers in the peninsula from which His Majesty&apos;s Government, as mandatories for Palestine and Mesopotamia and with special interests in other parts of the peninsula, will, alone of the Allies, be likely to suffer.His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore be grateful if the Italian Government could see their way, if possible, to stop the aeroplanes now at sea from being landed, and if in future they could give His Majesty&apos;s Government an opportunity of expressing their views before further consignments of armaments are licensed for export to the Hejaz.PERSIA.South Persia Rifles- [F.O.R., li, p. 7]. Referring to Mr. Normahs telegram [No. 490] of 3rd September, Mr. Soper telegraphed [No. 179/592/G.] from Shiraz on 6th September that from the point of view of the South Persia Rifles it was desirable that the offer from the Persian Government should be accepted. The following reasons were given: A refusal could not bo justified to the Persian ranks; the disposal, of effects would be facilitated ; the recognition of the force, even at this late hour, would provide protection for the Persian ranks who were already discharged from the animosity which would otherwise be directed against them ; there appeared to be no danger in accepting the offer.Mr. Soper pointed out that the force at the end of the month would be reduced to 1,000 men in Fars and 600 men in Kernian unless the disbandrnent was stopped. This could be clone at any moment when the matter was settled, but to continue disbandment after the Persian- Government had made public announcement that they were prepared to take it over would be to incur the hostility of the force. Its future value would depend on the arrangements made to officer it, but if the co-operation of local notables were secured by the Persian Government there was hope that it might once more become a factor of value for local security.On 12th September a telegram [No. 367] was sent to Mr. Norman from the Foreign Office, acknowledging the receipt of his telegram [No. 490] and of the foregoing-message from Shiraz, and informing him that the proposal of the Persian Government could not be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Accordingly, the disbandment was to continue.Soviet Activities. The following telegram was sent from the Foreign Office to Mr. Norman on 10th September : A note has been sent to Moscow yesterday by bag for presentation to the Soviet Government, drawing attention to continued violations of the trade agreement. An account is given of the activities of the Third Inter-national, especially in the East, for which the Soviet Government is proved to be responsible. Attention is called to RothstehPs anti-British policy in Persia, including propaganda, subsidies to newspapers and the proposed establishment of a revolu-tionary committee in Teheran. Reference is also made to the Bolshevik support .32-4 b
afforded to the Angora Government and to the intrigues in Afghanistan. The note concludes by&apos;calling upon the Soviet Government for an assurance that these activities will cease.     &apos; &apos; - :POLAND.Resignation of the Government. On 10th September Mr. Max Muller reported [No. 376] from Warsaw that the Prime Minister bad sent in the resignation of the Government to the Chief of the State and that the latter had requested the Marshal of the Diet to submit proposals for another Government. The Ministers would remain in office pending the formation of the new Government.Telegraphing again [No. 381] on 17th September, Mr. Max Muller further reported as follows: The Marshal of the Diet and the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me last night that it had been found impossible to form a Government of members of the Diet; so that it had become necessary to go outside for a Prime Minister in the person of M. Ponikowski, rector of the Warsaw polytechnic institution, who was Minister of Public Institution (&apos;? Instruction) under the regency (sic) during the German occupation.M. Ponikowski has accepted the task of forming a Government, and will retain certain members of the last Cabinet, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of War.Note from the Soviet Government.-The following telegram [No. 379] was sent by Mr. Max Muller on 16th September :-The Soviet Government Iras handed to the Polish Charge d&apos;Affaires at Moscow a long and violent note, quoting the alleged correspondence between M. Savinkov and the Polish general staff with a view to implicating the Polish Government in anti-Bolshevik activities, and citing a Lieutenant Myslowski as the intermediary. The latter has published a statement in the press to the effect that the whole correspondence was a hoax. All the letters had been written by himself and handed to &apos; the Soviet delegation in Warsaw, from whom he received a large remuneration. He had further been charged by the Soviet delegation with enquiries as to the formations of the Polish army. In spite of the improbable and even fantastic nature of the corre-spondence the Soviet delegation had allowed itself to be deceived.RUSSIA.Note from His Majesty&apos;s Government. A note dated 7th September was sent to Mr: Hodgson for transmission to the Soviet Government. The following is a summary; The note opens with an expression of the profound disappointment of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the last five months have shown no abatement of the hostile activities which M. Chichefin promised should cease. It proceeds to establish by verbatim quotations from reports and speeches dated May and June by prominent Bolsheviks who are not only members of the Soviet Government, but also officials of the Third International, that the activities of latter are controlled and financed by the Soviet Government, that the policy of both as to undermine the capitalist states of western. Europe, especially Great Britain, by an attack on their power in the East, especially India, and that the policy is being actively pursued in Afghanistan, through which, by virtue of the friendly relations guaranteed by the Russo-Afghan treaty, &quot; the communist International maintains direct communication further south with British India propaganda in which area is the primary objective of the eastern secretariat,&quot; and in. Persia, where &quot; in the near future we shall have at our disposition in the immediate neighbourhood of India a base amply sufficient for our task.&quot;The note then proceeds to substantiate charges under the following heads (a) India. Refers to the evidence held by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Soviet Government afforded financial and other assistance to the Indian revolutionaries summoned to the Moscow conference of 25th May, to discuss means for a revolution
iii India ; to Chattopadhyaya and members of the Indian Revolutionary Society in Berlin ; and to Hafiz for his journey to Afghanistan.(6) Persia. Refers to the various anti-British activities of Rothstein and his staff, including his desire to co-operate closely with Raskolnikoff, with whose assistance lie seeks to secure the replacement of the Afghan Minister in Teheran by &quot; another more actively hostile to Great Britain.&quot;(c) Turkestan.  Refers to orders issued by Moscow in March for the intensification of the propaganda in Turkestan and on the Indian frontier, and the allocation of 2,000,000 gold roubles for this work!(cl) Angora.-Calls attention to the money and arms supplied by the Soviet Government and the offer of active support, and quotes Stalin, Karakban and Eliava verbatim to the effect that Angora is the unifying centre of the front stretching from the Ganges to the Nile, along which no important event occurs &quot; without the sanction and knowledge of the Angora centre, which in its turn completely co-ordinates and regulates its instructions in accordance with our proposals and desires.&quot;(e) -Afghanistan. The note deals especially fully with this subject, and refers to the Bolshevik treaty as&apos; &quot;the most serious charge of all which His Majesty&apos;s Government have to make against the Soviet Government.&quot; It shows how the covnmuiiist luternationars line of communication with India is admittedly guaranteed by Article,X. and the supplementary article of the treaty communicated by Krassin, and by Articles IV. and V. providing for the consulate staff, which, in spite of protest, were stated by Suritz to Tarsi in May to be arriving writh Rosenberg. It is mentioned that His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware that quite recently M. Chicheriit laid particulai emphasis on the importance of the retaining clause providing for the eastern consulates, alleging economic reasons, though M. Chicherin must know that these are not valid. The note refers to the Bolshevik subsidy, and states that cash, which is no doubt part of the first instalment, is known to have arrived a,t Kabul. The note then deals with Jamal, who was sent to Afghanistan by the eastern depart-ment of the Moscow Foreign Office, and receives funds from Moscow through the Minister at Kabul, who in turn supervises Ins work. Objection is made to Jamals work amongst the tribes, and the amounts of the money received by him for this work are mentioned. It is then pointed out that the selection of Jamal, the cireum-stances of his appointment, and the fact that instructions sent him by the Turkish nationalists are sent after consultation with the Soviet or Third International, all show that he is merely an instrument in the latter&apos;s scheme for &quot; the creation of a powerful united Moslem movement which would deal the final blow against the power of capital, and destroy the colonial system upon which the power of western European capital rests.&quot;The note then concludes : &quot; On the above review of the history of the last five months, it is abundantly clear that the conditions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to renew relations with Soviet Russia by the conclusion of the trade agreement remains unfulfilled. In spite of all the professions of good faith on the part of the Soviet Government, there have been indications of bitter hostility towards I his country and its dominions and dependencies. Even apart from the specific considerations to which it is pledged, it seems utterly to have failed to grasp the eleinentary principles which ordinarily underlie the relations between Governments professedly at amity with one another, and naturally jealous of any attack on their own particular institution, it still appears quite incapable of realizing that a constant flow of inflammatory invective delivered by its leading representatives against the existing institutions of this country, is an absolute barrier to the renewal of correct relations, and that actual hostile activities by its agents must necessarily prompt the belief that its desire for such relations is insincere.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government.have long been loth to believe that the Soviet Government were not as anxious as they themselves to create a more favourable atmosphere than previously existed, in which Anglo-Russian relations could be gradually cultivated till they finally became entirely normal. It has been their sincere desire that the trade agreement should not only be carried out, but should be the prelude to better relations between the Governments and peoples of the two countries. Such a future is, however, incapable of realization if the conditions, which have been described in this note are to continue ; and His Majesty&apos;s Government, must ask for a definite assurance that the Soviet Government will cause these activities which constitute breaches of the trade agreement to cease.&quot;32--4 C ....
On 17th September Mr. Hodgsomreported [No..66] that he had that day presented the note lo.M. chicherin in the presence of M. Litvinoff.M/Ohiclierin had- qualified its contents as. a mass of forgeries and inventions. The pronouncements&apos; attributed to. Stalin.were, not genuine&apos;; Nuorteva never occupied the post with which he&apos;was credited, andhaving been in gaol since March could not have played the part ascribed to him ; MM. Lenin and Trotsky were the only members of the Government who were liaison members of the executive of the Third International, and this fact no more identified tire Third International with the Russian Government policy than did the fact that M. Vandervelde belonged to the Second International identify the policy of that body with the policy of the Belgian Government. AIT relations with Indian revolutionaries had been broken off and the propaganda school at Tashkend had long since been abolished. No anti-British agitation had been, undertaken hi Persia, where M. Chicherin understood that relations between the British Minister and the Russian representative were friendly. It was not the fact that troops had been sent or promised for Anatolia.With regard to Afghanistan,, it was the case that (? consulates) were to be (? created), but for trade purposes only. Relations with Afghanistan ,were: friendly, but had not been utilized for the purpose of the detraction of Great Britain.Commission for Russians-Relief.--Telegraphing ,[No. 681] from Paris on 15th September, Lord Hardinge transmitted the following&quot; telegram from Sir P. Lloyd Greame:--.The inter-allied commission for Russian relief, which met to-day at the Quai d&apos;Orsay, resolved that, notwithstanding the refusal of the Soviet Government to admit a mission of enquiry into Russia, the&apos; work..of the commission should .continue. No reply will be returned to the telegram of the Soviet Government, but an invitation will be issued to all Governments, including Germany, directly interested In. the Russian question to send representatives to a further meeting of the commission to be held at Brussels on 6th October. The invitation will explain the reasons;which decided the commission to propose the mission of enquiry, and will request the collaboration of the other Governments in recommending what methods, should be adopted in giving relief to the population in the famine area. The text of the invitation will be drawn up at to-morrow&apos;s meeting. &quot;  :&apos; % .SERBIA.Baranya.-The, following telegram [No. 200] was sent from Belgrade by Mr. Strang on 17th September:-The Serb-Croat-Slovene Government replied to-day to the joint note presented on 12th September by my allied colleagues and myself regarding the evacuation of the Baranya estuary. The following is a summary of the note, the integral text of which is being telegraphed to Paris by the French Minister: Having thanked the Conference of Ambassadors for its just appreciation of the attitude observed by the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government, the latter points out that its evacuation of Baranya within the specified period was made at a great moral and material sacrifice and without insisting on the previous fulfilment of a similar engage-ment by the conquered countriefe, The troops are established on a line which is in agreement with the terms of the treaty, leaving the final demarcation to the commission of delimitation. &apos;.As regards the villages in western Hungary, this is no new occupation, but one which dates from January 1919, when the line of demarcation between the Serb-Croat-Slovene territory and Hungary was established. (That?) Government feels it must maintain this line and hopes that the commission of delimitation will speedily fix the final frontier. This provisional occupation is all the more justified as the Austrian Government has begged that it should vbe maintained till the latter can take possession.TURKEY.Russian Refugees in Constantinople.--^ Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 616] as follows on 16th September : *&apos;&quot;...&apos; The United States High Commissioner has notified me that, owing to lack of funds, the dissolution of the Constantinople unit of the American Red Cross and the complete cessation of its activities from 1st October has been decided.
He points out that there are now some 50,000 Russian refugees in Constantinople, and lays stress on the menace to public health and order if concerted action is not taken for their relief before next winter, now that the French have ceased feeding civilian refugees and the wide activities of the American Red Cross are reaching their end. Owing to the continued business stagnation there is no labour market and the sources of local charity are running dry,Admiral Bristol has laid these facts before his Government and the American charity associations.I have caused Admiral Bristol&apos;s letter to be considered&apos;at a meeting of the allied and American military attaches, who recommend :  -(1) That the allied Governments be requested to urge the International Russian Famine Relief Commission (? Constantinople) to assist indigent Russian refugees in Constantinople.(2) That all possible steps be taken to repatriate such Russian refugees, as are willing, to Russia and particularly to the Caucasus.I share unreservedly the American High Commissioner^ view and consider that both from a humanitarian and a practical standpoint, this iDroblem calls for urgent and concerted international action.No further help can be expected from local charity.
