FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN:Attitude of Bnkliara.-Qn J3th May the Viceroy of India transmitted [681. S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs at Kabul recounting complaints that had appeared in the Kabul press agamst the encouragement given by the Bokharan Government to the Society of Afghan Revolutionists. This society consisted of prisoners escaped from gaol, convicts, and bad characters. The question was asked if this was to be the reward for the devoted friendship of Afghanistan.In a telegram [709 S.], dated 19th May, the Viceroy transmitted a sequel to the above in which Sir Henry Dobbs reported that the Amir of Bokhara had arrived in Kabul as the guest of the Amir and had been given a great public reception.Afghan Mission to Europe.--The Secretary of State for India informed [2681] the Viceroy on 28th May that Habibullah Khan, the Military Attache on the Afghan Mission, which it appeared had gone direct to Rome from Berlin, had applied to the British Ambassador the,re for facilities to return to Afghanistan via, Bombay. The views of the Viceroy were invited. The Mission was said to be in close, touch and in sympathy with Indian organizations in Europe, and especially with the committee in Berlin.ALBANIA.Relations with Greece. On 24th May Mr. Eyres telegraphed [No. 16] from Durazzo that an Italian consular officer from Janiua had arrived at Argyrokastro as an intermediary, bearing proposals from the Greek Government, viz., to release the arrested Albanians, now amounting to some hundreds according to the President of the Council, on condition that the Albanian Government, issued passports to Epirus without any national denomination. The President of the Council observed that this showed the baseless and arbitrary character of the arrests, but he could not accept&apos; the proposal, and intended making a formal protest to Greece.Also that a deputation of four notable Ohimara had reached Valona, and stated that they accepted the Albanian flag, the entry of Albanian troops, and the custom duties, but desired to discuss other questions affecting their ancient privileges. The President of the Council had accepted.False Statement in the London Press. Telegraphing [No. 17] from Durazzo on 25th May, Mr. Lines reported that the President of the Council had been informed by telegraph that a statement had been published in the London press to the effect that 200 Turkish officers under Noureddin Pasha had landed in Albania to levy war against Greece. He had requested him to state that there was absolutely no foundation for this allegation, which he suggested was only another instance of false Greek propaganda. His sole aim was to maintain good relations with their neighbours, and to be allowed to develop the country in peace.ARABIA, - 1IbnSaud and the Tlejaz. On 27th May Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 55] to -Jeddah informing Major Marshall that on 17th May King Hussein and the Emir Feisal had telegraphed to General Hadclad that Ibn Saud&apos;s troops were attacking near Taif, and that Sir Percy Cox had been instructed to inform Ibn Saud of this report and to warn him that he would receive no further assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government unless he adhered to &quot;his undertaking to maintain peace with the Hejaz.ARGENTINE.Port of Buenos Aires. On 27th May Mr. Macleay telegraphed [No. 80] from Buenos Aires as follows : The Argentine Government re-opened the port of Buenos Aires on 23rd May by a decree directing the port authorities to permit access to all qualified labourers.   In
view of the &quot;vague wording of the decree, employers sought and obtained assurances from the Government that the decree applied to non-union as well as to union labour, and that the former would be adequately protected. The.operatives were complacent .and resumed (? work) on 24th May; but some. conflicts occurred, resulting in two men being killed and several wounded.The two days following were public holidays, but to-day the port is in full operation ; so far with only minor (? disaffection^;.Both union and non-union labourers are engaged. The port area is patrolled by armed police and naval guards.The sudden change in the Presidents attitude is as unexpected as it is welcome, but developments in the immediate future are awaited with some anxiety.FRANCE.- The Ex-Emperor Karl. On 20th May Lord Cprzon instructed [No. 261] Sir Milne Cheetham to propose to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs that the French and Italian Governments and that of his Majesty should intimate officially to the Swiss Government that they will lie held responsible for the supervision of the Ex-Emperor ; asking them at the same time to indicate the measures taken to control his movements, and suggesting that adequate guarantees should be exacted that he will not leave Switzerland without permission, and binding assurances that he will neither enter the Austrian or Hungarian territories nor direct insurrectionary -movements there.GERMANY.Reparation. On 26th May Lord D&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No. 256] as follows :-The German Government have handed me a memorandum drawn up to show the measures taken since the acceptance of the ultimatum with a view to fulfilling its conditions.   It says : in the reparation question the preparations for the carrying out of the scheme of payment are in full swing. A sum of 150,000,000 gold marks in foreign currency has been at once placed at the disposal of the- Reparation Commission. To cover the remainder of the 1,000,000,000 gold marks payable before the end of May in gold foreign currency or Treasury bills, on Saturday, 28th May, according to the desire of the Reparation Commission, 20 Treasury bills to the value of $10,000,000 each, i.e., $200,000,000 (840,000,000 gold marks) will be remitted to Paris. The Treasury bills are endorsed bv German banks. $80,000,000 are payable in New York, 160,000,000 in Paris, and $60,000,000 in London.In regard to the disarmament question, the time limits fixed by General Nollet for the execution of the ultimatum have hitherto been all kept. The maximum establishment fixed by him for the armament and equipment of the army has been accepted, orders have been issued for the surrender of material thereby rendered superfluous. The immediate delivery of armament and other equipment of land and coast fortifications not permitted by the Commission of Control has been ordered and will be carried out without delay. The list drawn up by the Commission of factories authorized to supply stores for an army of 100,000 men has been accepted, and . the factories which are not permitted will be closed as soon as possible. In accordance with the request of the Commission of Control every order for war material without the previous consent of the Commission is prohibited. Orders have been issued as requested for the assistance of the activities of the Control Commission.The demands contained in the Paris decisions concerning the navy have already been partly fulfilled and are partly in course of speedy execution.The search for concealed aviation material is being carried out with the.greatest, -energy. The law forbidding the construction of aeroplanes and air motors of every sort is being drafted and -will be submitted to the Reichstag in the next few days. The export of aviation material of every kind has been forbidden. The German Government have declared their readiness to make indemnity for the destroyed Zeppelins in the form demanded in fulfilment of this obligation. Two civil airships, the Bodensee and the Nordstem, will be surrendered at once. The 25,000,000 marks demanded in the Paris decisions for exported aviation, material have been paid. The prohibition to employ aeroplanes for German police information has been agreed to.
The Commission of Control has been informed that the definition laid down by it for &quot;distinguishing civil from military aviation will be recognized.The surrender of the surplus arms of the police is nearly complete. The-necessary orders have been issued that the total strength of the German police should not exceed the limit of 150,000 men laid down in the Boulogne note.The legislative measures demanded in the Paris decisions for the alteration of the military service law and of the law regarding the import and export of war material are so far advanced. that they will be submitted to the legislative bodies-within the next few clays., Formation of Military Bands.-On 24th May Lord d&apos;abernon reported [No. 2481 that the President had that day issued the following order forbidding the formation of military bands : By virtue of article 4S of the constitution of the German state, I hereby decree as. follows for the restoration of public security and order : (1) Whoever undertakes to collect people together in military bands without the consent of the competent authorities, or whoever takes part in such bands, will be punished either by imprisonment or by a fine not exceeding- one hundred thousand marks. (2) This order enters into force on the clay of publication.Bavaria.The Sanctions.-On 31st May Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 11] to Mr. Seeds at Munich instructing him that he might declare categorically to the Bavarian Government that the only way in which they could avoid automatic application of&apos; the sanctions was for them to meet their obligations in full. Lord Curzon added that if Mr. Seeds could get his French and Italian colleagues to join so much the better, but if not he should act alone.On the same day Mr. Seeds reported [No. 24] that the Bavarian Prime Minister had explained in Parliament that morniug the necessity for complying with the terms of the ultimatum. He had said that the Bavarian. Government would loyally co-operate with the German Government as regarded disarmament, but as to dissolution they had asked the German Government to represent to the Entente that the einwohnerwehr did not fall under article 177 of. the peace treaty; should these-representations fail, the Bavarian Government and. the einwohuerwehr itself would loyally co-operate with Berlin in carrying out the latter s decision.Silesia.New Representative on the Plebiscite Commission. On 30th May Lord Curzon informed [No. 67] Colonel Percival, who has resigned his position as British repre-sentative on the Plebiscite Commission, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had appointed Sir Harold Stuart, K.C.S.I., K.O.M.G., K.C.V.O., to succeed him, and that he would, probably arrive at Oppeln on 4th June.The Situaiion-On 26th May Colonel Percival reported [No. 152] that the following telegram was being despatched by the Commission to the Council of Ambassadors: Numerous acts of pillage and destruction are reported to have been committed by the Polish insurgents, more particularly in. the districts of Rosenberg, Rybnik and Gross Strehlitz. The station of Rosenberg has been completely burnt.&apos; Two castles in the Gross Strehlitz district have been sacked. The corpses of both men and women have been mutilated. The Polish bands that have come, in from Posnania at Landsberg have pillaged the, country districts and even workmen&apos;s cottages. Con-centration camps for German prisoners have been established by the insurgents on the Polish frontier in Kreis Pless. (? Movement) for Italian and British officers and officials in execution of their duty has now become very difficult in the territory occupied by the insurgents. Officers and officials are often arrested,, detained and. subjected to insult; some of them have even been robbed of their money and personal belongings.Yesterday a train escorted by an Italian and a British officer and conveying food and clothing to the Italian troops at Gleiwitz was plundered.    The two officers,.
as well as the soldiers who formed the escort, were threatened, and only after surmounting many difficulties were they able to proceed.The Commission, which has not ceased to exert every effort to bring about peace and to prevent bloodshed, received a telephone message from the Polish consul-general at Beuthen, saying that Korfanty had asked him. to communicate the following: We are prepared to show our submission to the decision of the allied Powers by restoring the administration of the occupied, territory to the Inter-Allied Commission. In order that this-may be accomplished in an orderly manner and without compromising the safety of the person or the property of the inhabitants or the economic life of the country, it appears necessary to us that&quot; the Commission should determine the manner in which this restoration should be carried out, and that it should be supervised on the spot by the representatives of the Commission. We therefore request the Commission to take, without delay, such measures as are necessary to bring about a speedy pacification of the country. (Signed) Korfanty, Executive Committee.The Commission immediately considered the initial steps required for the execution of the above request, and particularly that of an occupation by the allied troops of a neutral, zone between the ,German bands and the iusurgents, which occupation could not be made effective until after the arrival of the British troops.Warning by the German Governm.ent.-On 19th May Lord D&apos;Aberuon telegraphed [No.. 22S] the following summary of an official warning issued by the German Government with reference to the recruitment of volunteers for Upper Silesia : While the Central Government understand, the feelings and the great excitement of the population, they must take strong action against the efforts which aim at offering independent help to the oppressed Upper Silesians by the formation of bands of volunteers from other parts of the state. In this way the steps that the Government have taken to defend German interests in Silesia will not be furthered but hindered. The Government draw very definite attention to the fact that such recruitment and the formation of military bodies are contrary to the existing laws.This urgent warning, under threat of prosecution, is given against the issue of recruiting appeals in any form, and especially in the press.GREECE.Exemption of Moslems from Military Service. On 19th May Lord Granville &quot;telegraphed [No. 263] that a Bill had been read the first time iu the National Assembly exempting&apos;all moslems from military service. The press stated that those already serving would be released when the measure became law and that no more moslems would be enrolled in the meantime.The Disputes with Albania and Serbia.  The following telegram [No. 273] was sent from Athens by Lord Granville on 25th May :  The Minister for Foreign. Affairs informs me that the President of the Council has received a telegram from the League of Nations stating that the Albanian Govern-nient have requested the intervention of the League to settle the disputes between Albania, Greece, and Serbia and enquiring whether the Greek Government would accept such intervention.The Greek Government have not yet replied and would be glad to know the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The only disputes they know of worth mentioning are in connexion with the settlement of the frontier which they consider to be in the province of the Supreme &quot;Council and to be practically already settled by M. Venezelos&apos; agreement with Italy which received the sanction of the Supreme Council.I gather from my Serbian colleague that he takes a somewhat similar view.To this Lord Curzon replied [No. 160] on.30th May, saying that the Conference -of Ambassadors in Paris would shortly, it was&apos; hoped, proceed to determine the future frontiers of Albania. Meanwhile the League of Nations would only be -exercising their functions as guardians of the peace in offering their good offices for the settlement of disputes which threatened at this, moment to disturb the tranquillity of certain regions oh the borders of Albania, Greece and. Serbia.   The recent- 29-1 13
incidents at. Koritza and the action of Serbs at Kossovo and Di bra were cases in point.ITALY.The Ex-Emperor Karl. On 20th May a telegram [No. 206] was sent to-Sir George Buchanan in the same terms as that to Sir Milne Cheetham [see under &quot;France&quot;&quot;].MEXICO.Relations with the United States. On 24th May Sir Auckland geddes reported. [No, 351] from Washington that the Secretary of State had informed him that the-United States Charge d&apos; Affaires in Mexico, who had been at Washington in con-sultation with the State Department, had just left for his post with a document designed to give effect to the following aims : (1) Recognition of the Obregon regime by the United States Government. (2) Abrogation of the objectionable features of article 27 of the Mexican constitution.1 - - : Sir Auckland added that he had observed that, the Embassy had kept in close-touch with the State Department in regard to Mexican affairs, and had expressed the-hope that the Department on their part would keep it informed of developments ; to which the Secretary of State had replied that he was doubtful whether these new proposals could properly be communicated before they had reached President Obregon, but that he would look into the matter. He had added that the press, statements made the clay before in regard to the nature of the proposals were entirely inaccurate.PANAMA.The Frontier Dispute [F.C.R., xxxix, p. 5], Telegraphing [No. 25] on 18th May from Panama Mr. Graham reported that the following were the names of the countries-and of the heads of the extraordinary diplomatic missions which have been appointed, to them to set forth the Panama case in connexion with the frontier dispute :-United States - - Sefior Narciso Garay, Minister for Foreign Affairs.Chile  - - - Sefior Octavio Menclez Pereira.Peru   - -. - Seiior Ednardo Chiari.Argentine - - SenorJdarmodio Arias.Brazil - Sefior Antonio Burgos.The missions were expected to last from two to three months. The three-principal missions to South America were to leave that clay and that for the United States on the following clay. The expenses were being paid out of the loan for national defence.Sefior Ricardo Aifaro was in charge of the Foreign Office during the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.PERSIA.Internal Affairs. Telegraphing [No. 312] on 25th May, Mr. Norman reported&apos; that the combined efforts of the Shah and the Minister of War had been successful in driving the Prime Minister out of office. Mr. Norman attributed this result to the-fact that the Minister of War no longer feared us since our troops had been withdrawn, and the Shah, to whom the Prime Minister had been represented as a dangerous. Bolshevik, was fearful for his own safety. Mr. Norman greatly praised the constructive efforts of the Prime Minister and the. comprehensive reforms initiated by him during; his three months&apos; administration,POLAND.Prince Sapieha.-On 22nd May Mr. Max Midler telegraphed [Nos. 266, 207] from. Warsaw as follows : I saw Prince Sapieha last evening, when he told me that, though he maintained, his resignation, he had consented to carry on temporarily at the Ministry of Foreign.
Affairs as a matter of public necessity. He has made three conditions : firstly, that he should not be called on to sign the acceptance of M. Piltz&apos; resignation, in regard to which he expressed himself very strongly ; secondly, that the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Diet should either apologize or resign ; and thirdly, that he should have an absolutely free hand in dealing with the Upper Silesian question without any interference either from the Government or from the Foreign Affairs Commission.   To these conditions he said that M. Witos had consented.I expressed my personal satisfaction at his Excellency&apos;s determination to stay on, even if only temporarily, and my regret at his absence from Warsaw during the early part of the present crisis.After telling us that he had been given a free hand to deal with the Upper Silesian question and expressing profound regret at &quot;his absence from Warsaw during the early days of the crisis, he declared that he was determined to do all in his power to restore the status quo ante in Upper Silesia and the full control of the inter-allied commission, as he realized that this was the first step towards securing a solution of the present international difficulties. I replied that I fully shared this view, and I felt that the safest method of securing this end was through the moral influence of the Polish Government with the insurgents.Prince Sapieha agreed, and begged me to inform your Lordship that he felt that he still had some influence with Korfanty and was only too anxious to exert it in the direction desired by the inter-allied commission. He had already instructed the Polish consul-general at Oppeln to ascertain from the commission exactly what action they would wish him to take. He would also be glad to receive any suggestions from His Majesty&apos;s Government.He was impressed with the need for acting before Korfanty lost entire control of the movement he had started, and the consequent urgency of combating the possi-bility of famine as hungry men knew no law. He had already informed the inter-allied commission that Poland was prepared to supply a certain amount of foodstuff through the Polish Red Cross provided that (group omitted) could control its distribution.   He sincerely hopes that the necessary arrangements can be made.Prince Sapieha has made a similar communication to the French Minister.PORTUGAL.New Cabinet.-The Times correspondent telegraphed from Lisbon on 25th May that a new Cabinet had been constituted as follows : -Senhor Barros Queiroz       -        -   Prime Minister and Finance.

On 21st May Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 367] from Constantinople as follows :-According to precise and reliable information the Greek military authorities are enrolling Ottoman subjects in the parts of Asia Minor under their occupation. Certain recently appointed employees of the Ottoman Bank have been called to the colours.My colleagues and myself have on two occasions notified the Greek High Commissioner of these facts, requesting him to take the necessary steps to put an end to acts contrary to international law, which expose Ottoman subjects to the gravest peril should they fall into the hands of the nationalists.The Angora Government have protested to my French colleague against such enrolments, requesting him to remind the Greek Government that they are exposing to the clanger of being treated as rebels those whom they force in this manner to-fight against their country.I. should be grateful if your Lordship would press the Greek Government to-(? group omitted) an end to these dangerous proceedings.
