FOREIGN COUNTRIES REPORT-ALBANIA.New Cabinet. Mr. Heathcote-Smith telegraphed  [No. 65] as   follows from Durazzo on 23rd December : -The resignation of Hassan Bey was hastened by the approach to Tirana of Ahmed Bey Mati with a force of several thousand strong consisting of Government troops, his own followers, and also Mirdita. This force remains in and around Tirana at his disposal.Hassan Bey ordered, his-armed partisans, who were the less numerous, to offer no resistance.2. On 22nd December I was present at the re-assembly of parliament which (? first) annulled the elections of eight deputies from the Drin district as having been illegal in view of the presence of Serbian troops in that region at the time. By this vote Hassan Bey and his chief followers were deprived of their seats.3. The chamber then voted a declaration to the effect that Akif and Mgr. Boumdoes had ceased to be Regents by reason of their dismissal from the Evangel Cabinet. Their colleagues had in vain maintained tlia-t Regents are irremovable, and that in virtue of the statutes- of Adslinia, the declaration of parliament would be ultra vires. .Akif Pasha with 100 armed followers left Tirana openly to-day.4. The questions of personal, responsibility for the crisis and1 of the formation of the new Cabinet are being now discussed.At present Ahmed Bey is virtual dictator of the situation, which is &quot;uucon-stitutional.&quot;Leaders of both sides profess to me a desire to avoid a conflict-provided that their adversaries are not too provocative.On 26th December Mr. Heathcote-Smith reported [No. 66] that a new Cabinet had been formed on the 25th as follows :-Djaffer Upi Bey - - - President of the Council.Mgr. Fan Mol &quot;      ,   - - - - Exterior.A mined Bey Mati Zogoli   -   - :- -. Interior., Kol Thatchi    -        - - - - Finance.Huscin Bey Urioni     - Justice.Colonel. Ismail Tazarti - - - - War.Spiro Koleka   -        - - - - Public Works.Recljtb Bey Mitrovitsa - Education.ARGENTINE.Purchase of Argentine Products.- Telegraphing [No. 191] from Buenos Aires on 22nd December, Mr. Macleay reported that it was announced in the press that the 1 Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed instructions to all Argentine legations abroad that they were to inform the Governments to which they were respectively accredited that the Argentine Government was prepared to concede them facilities for the purchase of Argentine products. It was understood that the facilities referred to would consist principally in the concession of credits. The measure was doubtless due to the desire of the President, in view of the impending election, to make a display of his anxiety to assist the agricultural and cattle-raising industries, which were passing through a serious period of depression.AUSTRIA.The Plebiscite. On 14th December Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 474] from Budapest that a telephone message had come through that morning from General Gorton to say that the Austrian Government had refused to recognize the validity of the plebiscite, and that their commissioner had been withdrawn; nevertheless the plebiscite operations had commenced. -. -     --     --
On 23rd December Lord Ilardinge reported [No. 970]; that the. result of the plebiscite bad been accepted by the conference of Ambassadors, whodiad addressed, a note tp. the Austrian. Government,;pressing, them to do the same. The-Austrian Government was also being told that a week after the Generahs formal proclamation Sopron. wouldbe handed over to Hungary. , &apos;[See &quot; Hungary..&quot;]-   BELGIUM. :New Cabinet.. On 15th-December Sir George Graham telegraphed [No. 192] from Brussels. that M. Theunis had formed a catholic-liberal Cabinet; M. Jaspar remained Minister for Foreign,Affairs.and M. Edck.Minister for the. Colonies. Seven out of the eleven Ministers had, been members ofthe Carton de Wiart, Cabinet.Transfer-of Territories-in Africa-Sir&apos;-George Graham telegraphed [No. 195] as follows on 17th December : The Belgian Government makes a pressing appeal to His Majesty&apos;? Government to delay taking over territory Until the frontier has been sufficiently defined. The Belgian delimitation&apos; commission could begin work in the early spring.The Belgian Government foresees inextricable difficulties connected with the maintenance of order, jurisdiction, the raising of taxes, and cattle diseases, if the operation is carried out before the establishment of the frontier line. . &apos; -Telegraphing [No. 19b] again on the 20th, he said: The Minister: for Foreign Affairs sent forme in order to beg me to impress upon His,Majesty&apos;s Government the earnest desire of the Belgian Government to postpone the evacuation of the ex-German African territory until the delimitation of the frontier. &apos;&quot;BOLIVIA.Tacna Ariea. On 22nd December Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 121] from Santiago that the Bolivian Government had telegraphed claiming the right to participate in the.Chilean-Peruvian negotiations and suggesting a tripartite-conference; &quot;and that the Chilean Government had replied to the effect- that it was noiconcern ofBolivians.,-;     ,   . . - -        . -&apos; . ;&apos; . - . ; .. ,Next - day Mr. 0&apos;Peilly1 telegraphed [No. 62] from La Pass that the Bolivian Government had replied to the; effect that Bolivia was not concerned, in a strict legal sense, but that no settlement could be just or lasting which left it without a coast.&quot;-&apos; [See &quot;Peru.&quot;; *CHILE.Tacna Arica.-^See &quot;Bolivia and&quot;-Peru.&quot; &apos;      &quot;&apos;&apos;-&apos; &apos;        &apos;   -&quot;&apos;      CHINA. -   -\-.* The- Tariff-On 13th- December Sir Beilby Alston transmitted [No. 456] the -following resolution of the British chamber of commerce at Shanghai; The British chamber of commerce at Shanghai, having learnt that the Washington conference proposes to agree to an immediate revision of the Chinese import tariff up &quot;to ah&apos; effective1 7;l: per cent, ad valorem, desire to record an emphatic protest against any revision of the Chinese tariff involving an increase in the existing fate1 of import duties which is unaccompanied by a corresponding revision of China&apos;s internal taxation of merchandise. The chamber of commerce see no reason whatever to alter the views expressed and unanimously approved at the conferences of the associated British chambers of commerce in-1919 and 1920, notably in the resolution passed at the second conference to the effect that advantage should, be taken of.a revision of tariff to press for the reorganization of the whole system of taxation of trade in China, and that, as a practical step hi this direction, the Chinese Government&apos; should.be-pressed forthwith for the abolition of the coast trade duties.&apos; The chamber recalled that in December 1918 the international tariff revision commission at Shanghai concluded its labours by passing a resolution earnestly recommending td;-the Chinese Government the advisability&apos;of devising measures for
the total abolition of all forms of inland taxation, and they understand that in February 1920 the Chinese Government notified the British Minister at Peking of their desire to abolish li-kin and their intention of &quot;summoning a conference of provincial representatives to discuss the matter. The chamber are of opinion that the conference now sitting at Washington affords a unique opportunity of bringing pressure to bear ou the Chinese Government to initiate these long-delayed and most necessary reforms and that failure to seize this opportunity will mean a continuance for an indefinite period of the burdens which now hinder the development of the trade of China.If the chamber are right in supposing that the Washington conference are considering the carrying into effect at a later date of the provisions of article 8 of the-Mackay treaty, they would point out that this article does not provide for the effective and complete abolition of internal taxation, as although it abolishes li-kin it leaves a loophole, for the maintenance of other and equally objectionable forms of internal taxation of trade.With reference to the suggestion that this increased revenue should be earmarked for railway construction, the chamber are of the opinion that if the Chinese railways are properly administered their revenues afford ample security for the raising of any further loans for their upkeep and extension, and consider that it is quite unnecessary to raise China&apos;s import tariff for this purpose.The chamber, acting on behalf of the associated British chambers of commerce in China and Hong Kong, beg that His Majesty&apos;s Minister will be so good as to telegraph the views above expressed to the Foreign Office for transmission to the British delegation in Washington.Resignation of the Premier. On !.9th December Sir Beilby Alston reported [No. 4(14] that the Premier had resigned. And on the 26th he further reported [No. 474] that Liang Shih Yi had formed a Cabinet and assumed office as Premier.FINLAND.Note from the Soviet Government. The following telegram [No. .193] was sent from Helsingfors by Mr. Rennie on 20th December:  On 17th December the Soviet Government addressed a further note to the Finnish Government in reply to the latter&apos;s note of 11th December, stating that they possess proof of the negative value of the assurances given by the Finnish Government. They declare that recruiting centres are (? working) in Helsingfors and other named places, and. that the organization of the bauds received help from the Schutz corps, and that bands numbering 300, 700 and even 1,000 men have crossed the frontier,, that their (&apos;? activity) now has been transferred from the northern to the southern parts of the Karelian frontier, with the connivance of the frontier authorities, and that the bands possess arms of Finnish origin.. Further, that the movement is actively supported by Finnish journalists, politicians, officers and even members of the Government. The note adds that the Government are evidently pursuing a policy contrary to the -wishes of the majority of the Finnish population, reiterates the assertion that the Government is responsible for the movement, and, in conclusion, declares that if the Finnish Government, persists in its refusal to take the.steps demanded in the Soviet Governments preceding note, the responsibility of the menace to peace with Russia will rest with the Finnish Government.The tone of the note is less threatening than that of the previous one. The Finnish Government will not reply for a few days, but, meanwhile, the Finnish Minister has been already instructed to reply to the more obvious mis-statements in a note verbalel27)e Situation. The following telegram [No. 201] was sent by Mr. Rennie on .27th December : -The representatives of the allied and associated Powers and the Baltic States were asked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go to see him in order to receive the latest information regarding the situation.According to the report of the chief of the general staff, three regiments of infantry have been echeloned along the frontier, with one regiment behind in reserve, :and artillery has been unloaded; but the remaiuing infantry regiment of this, the 11th, division has remained at Petrograd. Complete mobilization has apparently -been delayed.   Some few artillery shots were heard yesterday morning.
As the result of the previous meeting of the Cabinet the following statement was made to the representatives present: , .   -The Finnish Government, which on its side has respected and will continue to. .. respect the treaty of Dorpat, hopes that peace will not be violated on thei part on Russia. But if, contrary to expectation, a surprise attack be made against Finland, the latter will defend herself. In that event, and also if Russia, in consequence of the dispute regarding the Karelian question, presents to the Finnish Government an ultimatum, such as the latter could not accept from the point of view of the national interests or honour, the Finnish Government will ask whether the Government of Great Britain (read also France or Italy), either alone or in concert with her allies (also addressed to the Governments of Esthonia, Lettland, Poland or Roumania &quot; cither alone or in concert with the other border States on Russia&apos;s western frontier &quot;) would support Finland in her efforts to reach a. pacific solution of the dispute that has arisen.The Minister for Foreign Affairs added the following explanation :- On the receipt of the first news of the rising the Finnish Government instructed all governments and the frontier officials that all (1) recruiting and organization of bands on Finnish territory, (2) crossing of the frontier by armed individuals and groups, (3) sending across the frontier of munitions of war and Avarlike material, &amp;o, were forbidden; (4) that groups or individuals entering Finnish territory from Karelia, either as refugees or otherwise, were to be disarmed; and (5) that individuals showing an intention of entering Karelia with the object of participating in the fighting were to be sent back from the frontier districts.The Minister for Foreign Affairs added a declaration on behalf of the Finnish Government that neither did any organization of either Karelia or White Russia exist on Finnish territory with the object of armed activity against Russia, nor so far as the Finnish Government were aware did any such Finnish organization exist. (The so-called Karelian Government, consisting of two persons, Avere sent back to their country last week.)This measure, he contended, had been effective as to results.Transit Traffic to Riissia-Oh 20th December Mr. Reunie reported [No. 194] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that an agreement in principle had been reached at the Reval meeting regarding the transit traffic to Russia between Finland and the Baltic States, including Lithuania.A transit traffic commission was to be permanently established in Riga, Poland would be invited to adhere to the policy of the Baltic sea board States.Further, it had been decided to hold a meeting at Helsingfors at the end of February, to which the four Baltic States and Poland, would be invited in order to draAv up the basis of the general lines of economic policy to be pursued in commercial treaties with Russia for which it was expected that negotiations would be initiated next. spring.The Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared to be satisfied with the results of the Reval meeting, and hoped that these agreements would lead to a united economic front and prevent the economic penetration singly of the States concerned, by Russia, as Avell as by Germany.HUNGARY.The TUbi.scile.r-On 18th December Mr. Holder telegraphed. [No. 479] the following translation of a telephone message received on the 17th from the president of the generals commission, Sopron: Of the total population of 51,708 in the plebiscite area, the statistics of voting are as follows :  : -Registered on electoral lists - - -   26,900Effective voters    - - - -   24,068Voted for Hungary &apos;- - -   15,334      &apos;Voted for Austria - - - &quot; -.   8,227.

PERSIA.Position of the Government [F.C.R., lviii, p. 7]. On 14th December Mr. Bridgemau telegraphed [No, 685] as follows :-The Shah appears to have made up his mind to start for Europe as soon as he has obtained the consent of the Cabinet. The position of the latter is shaky ; it seems that the Russian Minister is urging the necessity for the Medjliss passing the Russo-Persian treaty as it stands without further delay. This the Medjliss is unwilling to do. Meanwhile the Minister of War is collecting all the revenues that he can lay hands on.. The receipts of the provincial post offices are paid to him, though as yet not those of the Teheran post offices.The financial difficulties of the Government are very great. Hospitals have closed. A strike of government employes is spoken, of, and the Prime Minister says the only alternative to handing over the country entirely to the military is to dissolve government departments, and to return to the kind of Government there was 50 years ago in the time of Nesr-ed-din Shah. He sent me &quot;a message to know whether the bank could be induced to lend money on the crown jewels, I replied that I was not authorized to help him in any way unless the conditions mentioned in your telegram No. 468 [E.C.R., lviii, p. 8] were complied with.With reference to the Foreign Office telegram No. 46S, Mr. Bridgeman reported. [No. 688] on 14th December that he had informed the chief manager of its substance, and had spoken to the Prime Minister in the general sense with reference to his constantly repeated appeal for money, accpuiinting His Highness with the four guarantees which the Persian Government must give in writing before there could be any cpiestion of an advance.With regard to 2, he had said that the Persian Government would prefer to raise the money from British sources, and if an advance were made by the Imperial Bank of Persia on oil royalties, he would guarantee not to offer them to third parties.With regard to 3, the Prime Minister had enquired what concessions were referred to. Mr. Briclgeman had replied that he had no precise information, but supposed that the Khostaria concession and the option, for railway construction granted to the Persian railway syndicate were included. He had undertaken to ask Lord Curzon to specify the concessions which must receive full recognition.With regard to 4, the attitude of the Prime Minister has been most unsatis-factory. He was disposed to argue that the option, granted by the Persian Foreign Minister to the British syndicate in January 1920, was not valid, because it had not been approved by the Medjliss. Mr. Bridgeman had said that if he took that line, he did not expect that Lord ,Curzon would let him have any money. -As regards the conversion of the former Russian bank into the national bank, the Prime Minister had. assured him that although it had been openly proclaimed that the policy of the Persian Government Was to restart this bank, there was no idea of making it into a State Bank or of interfering in any way with the position and privileges of the Imperial Bank of Persia.As regards the engagement of Swedish instructors to replace the British officers dismissed from the South Persia Rifles, the Prime Minister had observed that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government had agreed in principle to his note of 17th July, which included the engagement of officers of a non-limitrophe European country [F.C.R., xlix, p. 6], and no objection to, or preference for, any particular nationality had been expressed at that time.The Prime Minister had enquired whether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs objected to an American financial adviser for Persia. He had replied that he had formed the opinion from the Secretary of State&apos;s telegrams that the idea was not -welcome to His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Secretary of State replied to the above in a telegram [No. 4-84], dated 17th December, commenting on the extremely unsatisfactory situation, and pointing out that the Persian Prime Minister was apparently not prepared to give the necessary assurances on any one of the conditions under which His Majesty&apos;s Government might remove their embargo on British advances being made. The Secretary of State then dealt seriatim with each of the points to which the Prime Minister had endeavoured to reply.Referring again to the Foreign Office telegram [No. 4-68], Sir Percy Loraine sent the following report [No. 705] on 22nd December : The Prime Minister sent me a
message to-day enquiring our views as regards pawning a number of the crown jewels to the Imperial Bank&apos; of Persia. I replied orally, through.the Oriental Secretary, that in my opinion such an&apos;operation- would be most damaging to the general credit of the Persian Government, and that, if the need for money were so great, it would seem much better to secure it on conditions which your Lordship had. laid down.Perso-Afghan Treaty - [F.GR., xlviii, p. 81. Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 684] on 13th December that, with the addition of. two articles, dealing respectively with the protection of nationals of either country by their own officials, and the position of frontier tribes, the Perso-Afghan.treaty had been signed and the whole treaty had been approved by the Medjliss.Russo-Persian Relations [F.C.R., lviii, p. 7J. Gn 46th December Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 692] that the Russo-Persian treaty had been passed by the Medjliss the previous night.Referring to the foregoing message, Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 695] on .18th December as follows:-Russo-Persian relations, which had become rather strained in consequence of the Russian protest against the grant of oil concessions in the northern provinces to the Standard Oil Company, and of the unwillingness of the Medjliss to ratify the treaty without the modification of certain articles, have improved to a marked degree within the last few days. Yesterday the Ittehud, the particular organ of the Prime Minister, published the following under the heading:- &quot;Brotherly salute. To the Russians who. have rendered us assistance, and cancelled Article 13 of the Convention, and given us assurances regarding Article 5 and Article 6.&quot; To Rothstein, the learned socialist, who has enabled relations to be continued with Russia in a manner satisfactory to both parties. The Russo-Persian treaty was ratified last night.&quot;Mr. Rothstein overcame the opposition of the Medjliss by means of a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which was read out in the assembly. When the ratification of the treaty was moved the Government accepted the proposal that the Russian note should be placed on the same footing as the treaty, and be read in conjunction with it.   The treaty and note were then voted.On the motion of the Prime Minister the following suggestion by Moshir-ed-Dowleh was adopted : -&quot;The Medjliss does not consider that the concessions which have not been ratified by the Medjliss are included in Article 13.&quot;The Russian Ministers note explained that Article 5 and Article 6 provided solely for the contingency of armed hostility against Russia on the part of partisans of the former regime, or of foreign sympathizers who might be in occupation of part of Persian territory whence an attack against Russia could be launched. Article 5 and Article 6 do not refer to an academic or verbal attack on the Soviet regime by Persian or Russian refugees, which would not be of a nature to disturb the ordinary relations between friendly powers.As regards Article 3, Mr. Rothstein admits that there was error in connexion with the frontier as defined in 1881, and with regard to Article 3, Arfic-le 13 and Article (? 20), declares his confidence that the Russian Government wid raise no unnecessary barrier to Persian development, and adds that he is prepared, on condition that friendship--between the two Governments is preserved, to render the necessary assistance in negotiating the modification of the aforesaid articles in accordance with the wishes of Persia and the interests of Russia.I gather from the tone of the note and from the objection to passing the treaty raised in some quarters of the Medjliss, that Mr. Rothstein may have drafted his note without specific instructions from Moscow on every point.In view of the opposition in the Medjliss to the treaty, it is surprising that it should have passed so speedily, and apparently on the strength of rather flimsy assurances.Arrival of Sir Percy Loraine.-On 21st December Sir Percy Loraiue telegraphed [No. 702] as follows : t called on the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning. The former welcomed me very amicably, and said he had always been animated by friendly feelings towards Great Britain, but that unfortunate-nately he had come into power at a moment when circumstances rendered it-impossible to give effect to them. He trusted things would improve, and looked forward hopefully to my friendly co-operation. I said I was always at His Highness&apos; disposal for frank discussion of an)- questions between the two Governments, and would always do my utmost to settle them in our mutual interest.35-4 0
Tdcna Ariaa. Telegraphing [No. 180] from Lirmv on 10th December, Mr. Duff reported that the Peruvian Government had communicated.to him the text of (Pa-telegraphic) note of (? 12th December), received direct from the Chilean Government, inviting Peru to agree to hold a plebiscite forthwith respecting the, sovereignty of Taena Arica, and the text of the reply of the Peruvian Minister, for Foreign Affairs rejecting the proposal, but inviting the Chilean Government to join Peru in submitting the whole question of the sovereignty of the Pacific to arbitration arranged on the initiative of the United States Government. ;-On 24th December Mr. Duff further reported [No. 182] as follows :-In a telegraphic note of 20th December, Chile does not absolutely reject arbitration, but thinks it indispensable that the precise points to be determined should be first fixed and that it should be ascertained what the discrepancy in plebiscitary formalities is which compels recourse to the judgement of another country. The Chilean Government invite the Peruvian Government to continue direct negotiations, in the form deemed adequate by the lattel-;in&apos;order to reach a solution compatible with the treaty of Aeon, from the terms of which the signatories cannot depart. ...    &apos; &apos;The Peruvian reply of 23rd December hopes that Chile will define a declaration in favour of arbitration. The Peruvian Government does not consider that the execution, of Article 3 of the treaty of Aeon is the sole matter in debate : arbitration is essential to settle all existing differences, and accordingly the Peruvian Minister for Foreign Affairs has proposed impartial American arbitration under the auspices of the United. States Government, which will save irritating and disappointing direct, discussion..The Peruvian Government is ready to appoint a representative to meet the person selected by Chile in Washington to settle the basis and objects of arbitration.Four days later Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 131] from Santiago that Chile in a third;note, had replied that she accepted. (1) PeriPs suggestion and would send a mission to Washington to discuss ad referendum bases, and (2) object of the arbitration as being-the solution of all difficulties which prevented direct agreement and which stood in the way of the complete execution of the treaty of 1883..[See &quot; Bolivia.&quot;]POLAND. -Relations with the Soviet Government. The following telegram [No. 466] was sent from Warsaw by Mr. Max Muller on 16th December :-The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that he found M. Ivarachan, who called on him to-day on his return from Berlin, in a most amiable temper. Pie was full of expressions of goodwill towards Poland, and said that now that the Polish Government had given such clear proofs of their pacific intentions the Soviet Government would, on their part, fulfil scrupulously all their obligations under the treaty of Riga. Indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that numerous railway wagons containing works of art and furniture from Warsaw palaces are already on the way, and that a beginning has been made with the payment of the second instalment of 1-0,000,000 gold roubles. M. Karachan is going to Moscow in a few days, and has promised to urge his Government to open negotiations with the Polish Government for the conclusion of a treaty of commerce. Altogether, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without placing much confidence in M. Karachaks sincerity, is evidently pleased with the general tone of his remarks.M. Karachan also spoke of the recent rising in Karelia, declaring that the Soviet Government were much incensed against the Finnish Government for their attitude towards the movement, and for allowing Savinkov to set up at (? Helsingfors) new headquarters for his organization.PORTUGAL.New Cabinet.  On 3.4th December Sir Lancelot Carnegie reported [No. 135] from -Lisbon that, owing principally to the divergence. of interests of the political parties and of  the  revolutionary committee  in  connexion  with  the   coming
general elections, the Government had resigned. The situation, he added, was extremely complicated, but he hoped that a peaceful solution would be found. The visual rumours of trouble were current and might have some basis; as the exorbitant aiid ever-increasing cost of.necessities caused misery arid discontent.Telegraphing [No. 139] again on 17th December lie further reported, that a Government had been formed by Senhor Cunha Leal, who was Minister of Finance in Colonel Pinto&apos;s ministry.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senhor Julio Danfas, was a well-known literary man, who had been Minister of Instruction for a short time last year.None of the. new Ministers were persons of much political distinction; but they represented various parties hitherto in opposition ; the Government were said to have-the support of the principal political groups, the republican guard and the majority of the October revolutionaries ; the situation, was therefore easier. The Prime Minister had declared his intention of suppressing any disorder with the utmost, rigour..   -  ROMANIA.The Occupation of BiidapesL-On 19th December Sir I.L. Dering telegraphed [No. 264] as follows from Bucharest: The Prime Minister begs me to inform you that a question has arisen, in the commission of reparations at, Paris respecting the responsibility of Rumania for the occupation of Budapest. He hears, that the British delegate has proposed that the question should in the first instance be referred to the legal commission to , decide if die-military operations, in question were legitimate (? hostilities) owing to the attack of the Hungarian Bolsheviks.M. Take Jonescu strongly deprecates a reference to the legal commission and lays emphasis on the strictly legitimate character of. the.operations, which may be. held to have. (? saved) (? Hungary) from Bolshevism and also Vienna and other capitals at the same time. A decision adverse to Rumania would have disastrous consequence (? here). ... , .      .......     - &apos;- &apos;He personally begs His Majesfy&apos;s Government not to admit the possibility of,a reference to the legal commission, and has instructed the Rumanian Minister in London to speak on the. subject to your Lordship and, if possible, also to the Prime. Minister.RUSSIA.      rv-    ......Relations urith Finland. The . following telegram [No. 145] was sent from Moscow by Mr. Hodgson on 17th December :-The Russian Government professes to regard its relations with Finland as having reached a very critical stage. They appear satisfied that the Finnish Government is not in favour of the movement in Karelia, but attribute it to the machinations of reactionary Finnish groups receiving their inspiration from Manuerheitn and aiming at the. acquisition-,of Karelia. They insist on the complicity of Savinkov and the. White Russian organization. They will not (?-group omitted) Lettish rising could be the result of a spontaneous outburst of discontent, but maintain that it had been long-prepared and only rendered possible by help from Finland in the shape of volunteers and military supplies. M. Litvinoff declares that the Russian members of the mixed commission sitting in Helsingfors have been recalled and that the Government is contemplating the recall of the diplomatic mission. Probably M. LitvinofFs statements are designed to lend enhanced gravity to the situation, for it is untrue that the commission has been recalled, but Russians are so obsessed with the idea that they are the object of a conspiracy that a diplomatic rupture is not impossible.The result, however, would not necessarily be serious, for, according to the information, of the Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires; Russian troops cannot move forward from Petroxavodsk for several months owing to the lack of skis and other winter equipment. As a precautionary measure, all ladies attached to the Finnish legation have been sent home.Movement of Troops. On 23rd December Mr. Ronnie reported [No. 197] from Helsingfors that the Finnish Government had learnt that the Soviet Government were, concentrating some 50,000 troops, composed of three divisions and two independent brigades, on the Karelian isthmus. The object of the movement was stated to be the carrying out of the winter manoeuvres to last for a week beginning 27th December. M. Kamenef was reported to be in command ; M. Trotzky would also be present.
.; .       - -   SERBIA. -   ,,. .   .New Cabinet.-On 25th December Sir Alban Young reported [No. 302] from Belgrade that a new coalition ministry had taken ollice. M. Pasitch remained President of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs; :VI. Voja Marinkovic-became Minister of Interior in place of M. Pri bide vie; and M. Roho had taken the Ministry of Public Instruction.SYRIA.- The Armenians at Mersina. On 17th December the Foreign Office informed [No. 42] Mr. Satow at Beirut that further representations in regard lo the Armenians, at Mersina would lie useless, the French authorities being fully aware of their responsibilities.Protection of British Subjects. On 17th December Mr. Satow was instructed [No. 42] to inform the Spanish vice-consul, and any British subjects concerned, that the necessary protection of themselves and of British interests would be undertaken by the French agents in Cilicia. His Majesty&apos;s Government had been so informed by the French Government.TURKEY.The Patriarchal Election. Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 738] as follows on 19th December ; The Minister for Foreign Affairs has notified me that the Turkish Government&apos; consider the recent patriarchal election as null and void.The note states that, whilst desirous of assuring the religious liberty of its uon-Moslem subjects compatible with the interests of the State, the Turkish Government has regulated its exercise by fixed decrees and rulings, from which it has never derogated.As regards the oecumenical&quot; patriarchate, the rule has been that this religious chief shall be chosen by his community, but nominated by the Turkish Government; that he shall be an Ottoman subject and elected by such;&apos; that the members of the electorate colleges shall have been confirmed in their position by the State; that any candidate obnoxious to the State shall not be received ; and that, even in special cases, the elected patriarch may be deposed.Since the armistice, the late locum tenens had infringed the existing order concerning the formation of colleges not in conformity with the law, and without the confirmation of the State.On his decease the present locum tenens assumed his functions illegally, and is therefore not recognized by the Government.The Turkish Government, in view of the exceptional situation in Constantinople, did not intervene. The locum tenens has now, however, proceeded through colleges having no legal existence to the election of a patriarch, who by his Hellenic nationality alone is excluded from this dignity, to which only Ottoman subjects born of an Ottoman father are eligible.
