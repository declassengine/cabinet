FOREIGN COUNTRIES REPORT.ARGENTINE.Mr. Ginnell. The following telegram [No. 136] was sent hy Mr. Macleay from Buenos Aires on 24th August:  In the course of conversation this morning, at his weekly reception, the Minister for Foreign Affairs., without my having raised the subject, referred to his interview with Mr. Ginnell.I observed that I had seen a report of the interview in the press &quot;and that the meeting had taken place at the Ministry. I could, of course, only express my private and personal opinion, and could not conceal from him my surprise, not only that Mr. Ginnell should have been received at the Ministry, but that, the objects and nature of the latteFs mission being perfectly well known, his Excellency should have considered it necessary to see him at all.Dr. Pueyrredon replied that he had informed Mr. Ginnell previously through a member of his staff that the meeting could only be of a purely private character. As regards the question of receiving him at the Ministry, his Excellency appeared to consider this immaterial on the grounds that he could not divest himself of his official capacity by the mere fact of receiving Mr. Ginnell in his private residence. . fie had decided that, in order to remove all possible grounds for misunderstanding, it would be preferable for him to receive Mr. Ginnell privately and explain to him frankly the attitude of the&apos; Argentine Government rather than to decline to see him. He wished to tell me exactly what had passed at the interview.   -Mr. Ginnell exhibited his alleged credentials and, speaking in the name of four million Irishmen wdio claimed their complete independence, asked the- Minister to arrange an audience with the President in order that he might present his credentials and obtain recognition of the Irish republic by the Argentine Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he could neither accept the credentials nor ask for an audience, and, further, that the close ties of friendship between the Argentine Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government entirely precluded the former from recognizing an independence which the latter had. not admitted. Mr. Ginnell then asked if the Argentine Government would allow him to float a loan here for the Irish republic, and he replied in the negative Mr. Ginriell endeavoured to discuss the question, but the Minister declined to do so.His Excellency told me that he-had committed to writing the answers he had given to Mr. GinneRs questions and that he would be glad -to show these to me privately on another occasion.I thanked his Excellency for giving me such, a frank and full account of what had passed at the interview and said that I would at once report our conversation to you.AUSTRIA.Treaty of Peace with the United Stales. On 24th August Mr. Keeling reported [No. 176] from Vienna that the treaty of peace between Austria and the United States had been signed that day by the Federal Chancellor and the United States High Commissioner.The Military Situation. Mr. Keeling.telegraphed [No. 186] as follows on 1st&apos; September : hx the northern part of zone A, the situation is stable. Austrian gendarmes are at their posts on line A, which is held on the Hungarian side by a well-disciplined battalion of chasseurs. The country is quiet and the armed bands have disappeared. Oedenburg is on the Hungarian side of the line.The southern part is unoccupied. Gendarmes have been withdrawn behind the old Austrian frontier and the Hungarians profess to have recalled all their organized forces. The Austrians, however, believe that detachments are still at large with machine guns. The men therefore will not advance and the authorities will not order them. English officers left last night to clear up the situation on the Fried-burg-Pinkafehl road, by which the main column of the gendarmerie should advance.
- In the extreme south there are reports of encounters, but the generals do not -attach much importance&apos; to this isolated area. There are apparently some Serbian troops actually in the territory, aid the Austrian Government has received information -of a large concentration of troops in the neighbouring district of Hungary proper.The stories of outrages are grossly exaggerated. The actual casualties are : AAustrian gendarme,killed, 12 wounded and three Hungarians killed, all in the first day&apos;s skirmishing. It does not appear that any civilian has been killed, and in&apos; the northern area there was little or no. violence after the first encounter..    m yThe generals were dissatisfied with the behaviour of the gendarmes and with the Austrian civil Governor.- They were still opposed to.,theuseof the wehrmacht and wished the Chancellor to put soldiers in command of the gendarmes and move with -energy in the southern area. They believed that the resistance would collapse-if resolutely handled, but that delay would exasperate the population against the Austrians. The Hungarian commandant had begun to.-represent, the danger of communist incursions if the area remained unoccupied, and offered to re-occupy it with Hungarian forces under allied control.   The generals were not replying to this communication.,; BALTIC STATES.Note to Russian Soviet. See under&quot; Poland.&quot; , .&quot;     CHINA. &apos; &apos; &apos;   &apos;Intelligence Report. The following report was telegraphed [No. 343] by Sir Beilby Alston on 1st September. The resignation, of the military governoiyof. Hupei was accepted on 9th August And one of Wupui.fu&apos;s generals - was; appointed, to succeed him, Wupuifu being nominated inspector-general of Hunan and Hupei. This did hot satisfy the&quot; forces attacking Hupei, who have now been ejected from the province by Wupuifu. The latter has refused to accept his appointment and has issued a circular,telegram to all -the provinces condemning both the Peking and the Canton Governments and inviting .a national conference to meet at Lushan (a happy inspiration owing to its associations) with a view to the formation of a united Government, the revision of the constitution -and the appointment of delegates to the Pacific conference. The situation on the Yangtze has caused Chang Tao Lin to. abandon all idea of invading Mongolia, and the negotiations between him and the representative of-the Far East Republic have since been broken off. His position has at any rate temporarily&apos; undergone a set-back vis-avis that of Wupuifu, whose star appears to be in the ascendant.The efforts made to float an internal loan have so far failed to produce material results, and the Governments financial difficulties continue to increase.COSTA RICA. Relations mitli Panama-See under &quot;Panama.&quot;CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.- Zionist Congress. Telegraphing [No. 1-02] from Prague on 2nd September Sir George Clerk reported that the Zionist congress had requested him-to transmit the following message:-    -.     .The twelfth Zionist congress at Carlsbad, attended by Jews from every country, .sends His Majesty King George the expression of its respectful homage. It trusts that the: realization of the age-long aspiration of the Jewish people to rebuild a -national home in -Palestine may be consummated under the asgis of His Majesty&apos;s -Government, as mandatory of the League of Nations, to the advantage of Palestine,, the Jewish people and the whole of humanity..    : GERMANY.Treaty of Peace with the United States. On 25th. August Lord d&apos;abernon reported that the treaty between the United States and Germany had been sigued that -day at 5 o&apos;clock. &apos;
After reciting in a preamble portions of the Congress resolutions approved by the. President on 2nd July 1921 and stating that the two Powers are desirous of restoring friendly relations : Article I. grants to the United States all the advantages specified in the aforesaid resolution as well as in the treaty of Versailles, notwithstanding the fact that the latter-treaty has not been ratified by the United States.Article ]I. cites the main articles of the treaty of Versailles, defining the rights; to be enjoyed by the United States: it states that the United States shall. not be bound&apos; by the clauses relating to the League of Nations ; that the United States assumes no obligations under Part II., Part-III., Part IV. (sections 2 and S), and Part XIII.; that the United States can participate in the Reparation Commission, but is not bound to do so; that the delays mentioned in Article 440 of the treaty of&apos; Versailles run.from the coming into force of the present treaty.Article III. provides that ratifications shall be exchanged as soon as possible at Berlin. .Emergency Lair. On 29th August Lord D&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No. 4-39] as-f ollows: A Cabinet Council was held this, morning, at which measures of urgency were-passed to protect the Republic against the clangers which menace it. The following is a summary of the statement issued, and of the emergency law which has been, promulgated: -The Government notes with grave anxiety the growing decay of public morals. Political agitation aiming at the overthrow,of the constitution and the Republic has-become shameless. Certain political groups openly suggest violence and murder as a means to this end, and these views tend to spread to the people. The Government is described as a clique of incapable, weak-kneed and un-German politicians. It is our duty to deal with a firm hand with these agitators, who are partly irresponsible, partly unscrupulous.The emergency &quot;law provides that periodical literature inciting to violence against the constitution or its institutions, or members of the Government, may be-suppressed for 14 clays or, if a previous warning has been issued, for three months. Such periodicals may also be summarily confiscated. The publisher, printer, or retailer is liable to a fine of 500,000 marks with imprisonment. Meetings and processions may be forbidden whenever just anxiety exists that the overthrow of the-constitution, or its institutions, or violence towards members of the Government may be discussed at them, or where disobedience to the law or contempt for the ordinances of the Government may be encouraged.Promoters of and speakers at proclaimed meetings are liable to a line of 500,000&apos; marks and imprisonment.Commercial Agreement with Italy. See under &quot; Italy.Licensing Organization. On 1st September Lord Curzon sent [No. 70] the-following instructions to Mr. Robertson at Coblenz : The Supreme Council decided on 13th August that the expert allied committee-should meet forthwith at Oobleuz to discuss with the German authorities the precise form of the organization which, when the customs sanction disappears on 15th September, will collaborate with the German authorities in supervising the issue of -import and export licences. The committee was to submit recommendations by. 1st September.The British expert having gpne to Coblenz with full instructions, and the French experts having been appointed, I had assumed that the High Commission had brought the experts and the German authorities together, and that discussions were proceeding. In this way useful preliminary work would have been done pending the consideration of the German reply by the allied Governments.As you are aware, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government has throughout been that the customs sanction should be removed if the German Government accepted the-principle of an inter-allied organization for the purpose indicated. I therefore fail to understand the assumption of your telegram that thc^ experts cannot meet the-&quot;Germans until the reply of the German Government has been accepted as satisfactory.. They might have met without, committing either side. You should expedite-discussions on these lines.   -
Silesia.The Silualion-On 24th August General Sir W. Heneker telegraphed [No. 347J that the latest report of the situation in Kreis Rosenburg was better. Count Prashma had seen the principal Germans in Kreuzburg and Rosenburg, and they were all on the -side of law and order, and if assured of British support will take steps to rid the country of the principal leaders (? of the) gangs of hotheads who have lately got out of hand. I saw Colonel Kennedy, the military commandant of the area, on the subject yesterday, and the closest liaison and co-operation is being established between the military authorities, the Kreis controllers, the police and the influential Germans. If the Germans themselves will do the work so much the better, and I think they will. Four machine guns and all of the rifles taken in the British detachment incident on 7th August have been handed over to the British military authorities by the Germans.   The ringleaders have fled across the border.HONDURAS.Invasion of Nicaragua. Telegraphing [No. 22] from-Tegucigalpa on 24th August, Mr. Lyall reported that armed Honduras forces had invaded Nicaraguan territory. It was believed that arms and ammunition had been supplied from Sah Salvador and, the plot organized there. The Government of Honduras&apos; denied all responsibility. Information had been received that American marines :had been landed at Corinto (Nicaragua).HUNGARY.Treaty of Peace with the United (States.-Mr. Hohler reported [No. 240] from Budapest on 31st August that the United States representative had informed him that the treaty between the United States and Hungary was signed on 29th August. It contained sections 3, 4, and 5 of the peace resolutions passed by the Senate on 1st July. It further contained parts 5, 6, 8, 9,10, 11,12, and 14 of the treaty of Trianon, omitting the remainder.- &apos; ITALY.Commercial Agreement with Germany. Telegraphing [No. 357] from Rome on 30th August Mr. Kennard reported that it had been &quot;announced that a commercial agreement between Germany and Italy had been signed in Berlin, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that it &quot;was only a technical arrange-roent regulating imports and exports to and from Germany for the next nine months. It contained no other provisions of airy interest.The Albanian Problem. Mr. Kennard telegraphed [No. 368] as follows on 5th September :  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has handed me a note expressing satisfaction at the interest displayed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the realization of the inde-pendence of Albania, which has always been advocated by Italy. He (? observes),. however, that the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government is due to the threats against the integrity of Albania, which justify the Italian Government in insisting on italy&apos;s demand for definition beforehand, in consultation with the Allies, of her position as regards Albania. &apos; This definition the Italian Government consider essential in the undeniable interests of the country before any further decisions be taken as regards the future of Albania.As the object desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government is in harmony with the initiative spontaneously taken by Italy for the solution of the Albanian problem, the Italian Government cannot but fully approve it, and as soon as the diplomatic situation of Italy (group undecypherable) has been defined she would see no objection to authorizing the League of Nations to declare that the Great Powers have granted Albania, the frontiers of 1913, on the understanding that Italy remains in possession of Saseno Island, respecting which she can admit no discussion.The Italian Government count on the friendly attitude of the Allies in regard to the Albanian problem, which is of national interest to Italy. In order, however, to facilitate the satisfaction of her wishes and the execution of the British proposal, she is of opinion that instructions should be sent to the respective delegates at Geneva to press for the postponement of the discussion of the Albanian question in order that 32-2 B
the allied Governments may have time to come to an understanding regarding the-position of. Italy. . Meanwhile, to avoid complications, steps should be agreed on in Athens and Belgrade in order to prevent any possible action by Greece or Serbia in-Albania.The Italian Government await the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government, confident that the latter, realizing the sincerity of the intentions of Italy and the importance which Italian public opinion attaches to the Albanian question, will come to the^ requisite preliminary understanding so that the collaboration of the allied Govern-ments in the solution of the Albanian problem may prove expeditious and. efficacious.JAPAN.The Coming Conference. The following telegram [No. 327] was sent by; Sir Gharles Eliot on 27th August :--The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that he has instructed the Japanese Ambassador at Washington, to ask the Secretary of State for a definite statement as to the proposed agenda for the conference.Public meetings have been held about the conference in Kyoto and Osaka under-official auspices, in which the speakers showed great distrust of the United States,, and the audience seemed in favour of Japan making a firm stand.The general staff continue to discuss the details of disarmament, and have been, recently considering the propriety of such modern methods as poison gas and air-bombing; also the possibility of adopting in Japan the system of the British territorial force.MEXICO.Capture of Senor Dominguez. Telegraphing [No. 93] from Mexico on 2nd September, Mi-. Cummins reported that Sehor Robles Dominguoz, who entered the Republic with a view to heading a new revolution and the establishment, of a provisional Government in New Laredo, had been captured.NICARAGUA. Invasion from Honduras: See under &quot;Honduras.&quot;PANAMA.Relations with Costa Rica. On 25th August Mi\ Graham telegraphed [No. 27] as follows from Panama : -The. Government of Panama have ordered the evacuation of Goto, without resistance, to the Costa Ricans.This step followed an official communication from the United States Government, received on 22nd August, that they would not tolerate the renewal of hostilities, and the news that 400 marines had been sent on board the United States S.S. Pennsylvania under sealed orders to Panama, in connexion with the frontier situation.The Government of Panama have since published a manifesto signed by the President and the Cabinet, setting forth the history of the frontier question since February last, and protesting against the course adopted by the United States of America and Costa Rica.PERSIA.South Persia Rifles [F.C.R.,&apos;l, p. 7]. On 25th August Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 471] that the Prime Minister had stated to him that the deputies, with whom he-had discussed the subject, had raised difficulties regarding the terms on which the Persian Government were to take over the South Persia Rifles, and in spite of his efforts would only accept the following: (1) The force to be handed over to the Persian Government without British officers; (2) a sufficient number of Swedish officers lo be engaged for instructional purposes, and, pending their arrival, the force to be officered by Swedish officers already in the Government employ and by a number of Persian officers to be appointed to the force ; (3) after the expiry of three
or four mouths from the date of the exchange &quot;of dotes, no British officers or officials to be remaining with the force; (4) His Majesty&apos;s Government to undertake an arrangement with the Imperial Bank of Persia for a credit to the Persian Government to cover the cost of the force&apos;for six months ; (5) all arms, munitions and equipment in possession of the force to be handed over to the Persian Government without payment. While holding out no hope that these terms would be accepted, Mr. Norman had said that he would submit them.Commenting on the above, Mr. Norman said that he considered the terms&apos; impudent, and recommended that not only should the disbandment be continued, but,, in view of the lack of funds, accelerated if possible.The Prime Minister had stated that according to advices received the Swedish were prepared to lend 10 regular officers to the Persian Government.In reply to the above/the Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 343] to Mr. Norman on 26th August his agreement with the Iatter&apos;s views, and instructed him to inform the Persian Prime Minister officially of the surprise and regret with which they had received his proposal, and their inability to consider it.Mr. Norman acknowledged the foregoing in a telegram [No. 483], dated 31st August, and reported that the Prime Minister had communicated to him his obligation to consult the Minister of War or the Shah before accepting the conditions we proposed. It appeared that the former, who was short of arms and ammunition, had counted on acquiring those which were with the South Persia Rifles, and the Shah, alarmed at the prospective disappearance of the force, had begged postponement of the clisbauclment for five clays, so as to afford time for a more satisfactory solution of the problem to be found.Mr. Norman had stated his inability to comply, but had recommended the Shah to make his offer without delay. Mr. Norman doubted if the new proposal would be more worthy of consideration than the other, and pointed out that the state of uncertainty in which British officers were being kept, and the financial situation, rendered it necessary for the question to be settled without further delay.Referring to the above, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 490] on 3rd September the following revised offer from the Persian Government: (I) The readiness of the Persian Government to take over the force at their present strength, without British or Indian officers and officials, and to provide for the cost of upkeep from their own revenues ; (2) agreement in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government to hand over the force within three months from date without&apos;any conditions; (3) sale of the arms and stores now with the force by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Persian Govern-ment, concessions being made as to price, and payment to be made by instalments. Superfluous stores, &amp;c, to be taken out of the country.In his remarks on these proposals, Mr. Norman called attention to the absurdity of the proposal to pay for the maintenance of the force out of revenues. He suggested that the Persian Government; on the strength of having recently received an unconditional loan from the Imperial Bank of Persia, now thought that th.w had only to ask for money to obtain it. As to the proposed sale of arms, &amp;c, it showed the anxiety of the Minister of War to obtain them, and a possible suspicion of an&quot;intention on our part to sell superfluous arms to the Bakhtiaris. He proposed to consult the Inspector-General and asked for no decision before obtaining his opinion.Anti-British Altitude.---Telegraphing [No. 472] on 25th August, Mr. Normaii reported the opposition of the deputies to the engagement of Mr. Armitage Smith, on the ground that the Medjliss would refuse to sanction the employment of a Financial Adviser belonging to a neighbouring country. The Prime Minister feared he would lose his majority if he included the engagement in his programme. Mr. Norman was of opinion that the Prime Minister, while professing friendliness to us, was making-no effort to give, a pro-British direction to affairs.In a succeeding telegram [No. 473] on the same date, Mr. Norman described the situation as being that Nosrat-ed-Dowleh, by means of bribing the deputies, had secured a majority in the Medjliss, and at the same time had come to some agree-ment with the Prime Minister to maintain the present Government in power, so long-as they kept up their anti-British attitude. Attacks on British policy, led by Nosrat,&apos; had recently increased in violence. In particular, the agitation .against the South Persia Rifles and the Financial Adviser was stronger than ever. Mr. Norman antici.-. pateel no change in the course of events so longas the present Government saw that
they could obtain money&apos;unconditionally from British sources. He considered that the only way to bring the Persian Government to reason and to produce a situation generally favourable to our interests, was to induce British financiers to abstain from making any advances to Persia until the establishment of. a more friendly and less unprincipled regime.On 3rd September Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 492] that the Financial Adviser-found his position so intolerable that he&apos; had decided on immediate withdrawal. Mr. Norman expressed his approval of this decision, and of his intention to remain in India in the hopes that a favourable change in the situation might enable him to-return and take up his work again. Mr. Norman doubted, however, whether such an opportunity would be likely to occur.In a later telegram [No. 494] dated 4th September, Mr. Norman explained that the Financial Adyiser felt the impossibility of working without the complete support of the Medjliss. The anti-British agitation, the exorbitant demands of the Minister of War, the threatening attitude of the Russian Minister, which put the introduction of financial reforms out of the cprestion, all combined to make the position unworkable. Mr. Norman agreed and emphasized the fact that the Financial Adviser&apos;s inability to continue was in no way due to his personality, which still commanded wide respect.Political Development in Kurdistan. See under &quot; Turkey.&quot;POLAND.Note to the Russian Soviet.-The following telegram [No. 372] was sent from Warsaw by Mr. Max Muller on 26th August :--The Ministry for Foreign Affairs have sent me the text of a note from the Polish Government to the Russian Soviet Government, which was presented on 25th August by the Polish representative at Moscow.The note complains that organizations in Russia which are undermining the authority of the Polish Government, harming Rolands social welfare, and embittering Polish-Russian relations, are permitted to continue and are even supported. Certain of these organizations will, it is unclerstodd, be transferred to the office of the Third International; but the Polish Government will hold the Soviet Government responsible for the activities of this institution so long as it is on Russian territory.The note also complains that the Soviet Government is evading its.obligations&apos; (? concerning) the repatriation of Polish citizens in Russia, and is preventing the return of educated persons.The Polish Government states that all its efforts to establish good relations with the Soviet Republic are thwarted by a lack of good faith on the part of the latter, and expresses the hope that this Government will rectify the evasions of the treaty of Riga mentioned, thus proving its desire to strengthen the peace concluded between the two countries.Similar notes have been handed simultaneously by the Finnish, Esthonian, and Lettish representatives at Moscow on behalf of their respective Governments.   It was decided to take this step at the Ilelsingfors conference between the four Baltic   j States on 29th July.      &quot;PORTUGAL.New Government.-Telegraphing [No. 70a] on 29th August Mr. Grant Watson reported that owing to internal dissensions the Government had resigned on 27th August and that Senhor Queiroz was endeavouring to reconstruct the Cabinet from members of the Liberal Party. If he failed Senhor Granjo, the late Minister of Commerce, would endeavour to.form a Government from the same party.Telegraphing [No. 72] again on the following day he further reported that Senhor Granjo had formed a new Cabinet composed solely of Liberals, and that five Ministers of the former Government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs,, remained in office.The situation, Mr. Watson added, owing to the attitude of a section of the army, was very much disturbed and there was much opposition to the new Government.
RUSSIA.Retie/.-6n 25th August Mr. Hodgson reported [No. 40] from Moscow as follows : Dr. Nansen arrived at Moscow yesterday as High Commissioner for the Geneva Conference. He is accompanied by Messrs. Gorvin, Lodge, and Friclc... lie is placing before M. Chicherin two proposals. The first is to create an (? international) Russian relief executive, consisting of representatives of the Geneva Conference and the Russian Government, for handling such relief resources as shall be forthcoming from private organizations. The second is that the Russian Government approaches through him the.Governments of foreign countries with a request to grant to Russia credits for 10,000,000?., to be repaid by bonds bearing 6 percent, interest repayable in 10 years, to be a first charge on the national assets.Dr. Nansen does not appear to hope much of the Paris conference, which he thinks will waste much time before getting to work. He criticizes the American relief plan, under which operations are to commence in Petrbgrad and then in Moscow, whereas it is obviously vital that relief should begin in the district where it is most required, namely, the Volga.On 31st August Lord Hardinge telegraphed from Paris [No. GG1] that at the. first meeting of the Russian Relief Commission held, on the previous day.it had been decided to send a mission of enquiry to Russia, owing to the lack of adequate information about the conditions in the famine area. The constitution of the mission, its terms of reference, and the text of the message to be sent to the Soviet Government would be drawn up by a sub-committee.Notes from Poland and the Baltic Stales-See under &quot; Poland.&quot; The Par East.Relations with Japan. Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 327] from Tokyo on 27th August that the conference with the Chita representatives was to begin that day atDairen; and that the orders for the 8th division to proceed to Vladivostock had been suspended but not cancelled.SERBIA. &apos; &apos;The Occupied Territories. Telegraphing [No. 189] from Belgrade on 29th August, Mr. Strang repeated the following message, which had been sent to Budapest by Colonel Gosset:  .I interviewed the Minister (group undecipherable) Pasitch and M. Popovic, Assistant-Minister for Foreign Affairs, to-day with regard to the line taken up by the Serbs. They denied that any document had been signed giving the. Serbian Governments approval to any plan, map, or line in connexion with the occupied territories. I replied that in that case it was a question for the diplomatists to arrange, as my instructions were merely to supervise the withdrawal to the line approved by both Governments and the Ambassadors&apos; Conference. M. Pasitch inclined to weaken, but M. Popovic remained firm. They both agreed that one commander, with full power over all the occupied territories east of the Danube, should have been appointed in accordance with the plan which they appeared to acknowledge in this connexion. Also possibly they may give way on the question of the signature of the protocols. The conversation was very friendly throughout, as I took the line, in view of their statement, that the matter was now out of my hands. I am returning to Pecs to-night. ainLwili send a map showing the line held by the Serbs.SPAIN.Political Situation. Sir Esme Howard reported [No. 172] as follows on 23rd August: Senor Cambo has accepted the Ministry of Finance, but has pointed out to,the Prime Minister that he cannot support the railway policy or the public works policy of Senor (&apos;? La Cierva). The papers state that the President of the Council assured him that as the programme of the present Government would contain only two planks,32-2 C
10viz., the settlement of the Morocco question and the extension of the law re the Bank of Spain, the opposing views of Messrs. Cam bo and (? La Cierva) need not prevent the former from accepting office.This means, of course, that so long as the present Government remains in office the railway settlement and other important contentious questions will be shelved. So far as I can gather the general, opinion is that the Government cannot last much beyond the autumn. -Senor Cambo stated in an interview that his efforts would be directed to the reduction of expenditure wherever possible, to avoid further increase of the deficit, which, with the new expenditure for Morocco, would npw amount to 1,200,000,000 pesetas..... SYRIA.The Druses. On 5th September Mr. Palmer telegraphed [No. .13] from Damascus: that Disiib and Abdul-Gafar-Attrash had .called upon him, and iu the name of the Druses asked for the whole of the Druses to be included in the British zone as an independent emirate not (? under) the rule of Abdullah.They had declared that all the Druses desired this, and that if they received assurances of our backing they would start (? a propaganda) and appeal to the League of Nations.   He had given a non-committal reply.TURKEY.Political Developments in Kurdistan. The High Commissioner of Iraq reported by telegram [No. 433], dated 26th August, that the indications of political development in Kurdistan outside Iraq were increasing.1. As stated in previous correspondence ending on 13th November 1920, they had been definitely invited in November 1920 to assist abdul rahman of Shernakh in an anti-Turkish movement., The divisional adviser had just notified him that abdul rahman was now pressing for an interview with King Feisal, whom he wishes to proceed to Zakho for consultation with him. He had also asked that the assistant political officer at Zakho and cerlain leading contractors might be allowed to meet him in conference. His object, it would appear, was to create a small state immediately north of Iraq, arid possibly adjoining another state to be created by Simko, both of them taking advantage of the present weakness of Persia and Turkey.2. Although the position was obscure, the Kurds in the region of Dersim and Kharput appeared to have been in a more or less constant state of revolt.3. In correspondence he had reported the Simko outbreak against the Persian Government. Although direct information was difficult to obtain, it would seem that Simko had succeeded in establishing some sort of semi-independence in the region of Urumia.4. There were unconfirmed rumours shortly after Zia-ul-din&apos;s fall of attempts to form a Kurdish federation with the object of carrying out a separate Kurdish state in the event of Russian intrigue resulting in the break-up of Persia into several minor states.5. Not only has Persia confessed her powerlessness to protect her own subjects in the Urumia district, but, by refusing to allow Assyrians to re-enter Persia at all, may be held to have relinquished all claim to retain her sovereignty over the Assyrian community. One result arising out of this has been that after being turned back from the Persian frontier by armed force some Assyrians are reported to have died of hunger and others to have become converts to Islam in order to be allowed to return home by devious routes.6. Simultaneously^ with the communication referred to in para. 1,, the political officer at Suleimaniyeh has forwarded me an invitation addressed to him by Simko to meet him. I have informed him he may meet Simko at a point near our frontier provided he is satisfied as to his personal safety, and discuss the reasons why the latter permitted hostile Turks freely to penetrate the territory over which he exercises some measure of control, and also to sound him as to possible terms of repatriation of Christians.
7. A report has since reached me that Simko is reported to have circularized leading Kurds, suggesting that Kurdistan should throw off the yoke of the Persian Government and promising assistance of the most powerful character from a foreign power.8. The recent situation in Rowanduz seems to show that preponderant opinion in these areas is in favour of Great Britain if we can find a political solution which will content them.9. The situation may be summed up as follows : In light of this accumulation of evidence, generally speaking there is a growing movement in the direction of Kurdish independence which is favourably disposed towards Great Britain. If the proposition develops along these lines, it must sooner or later involve a breaking away of Kurdish districts from Persia and Turkey respectively. The altered attitude of the Persian Government towards Great Britain, and recent Turkish defeats in Anatolia, suggest that considerations which would formerly have prompted us to discourage such a movement have lost for the time being much of their importance.10. Unless instructed to the contrary, therefore, I propose, while refusing formal intercourse with the Kurdish chiefs beyond our borders, to use opportunities of ascertaining their intentions and to take (? promptly) such action as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the frontiers of Iraq. It is impossible not to recognize that their quarrel with their present suzerain may break out, but I shall carefully avoid any side in it.   However circumspect our action, we shall be accused of complicity.
