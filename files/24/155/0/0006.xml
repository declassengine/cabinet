FOREIGN COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Agreement with Angora [F.O.R., xlv, p. 2]. Referring to the agreement- between Afghanistan and Angora as the Afghan-Kemalist treaty, the Secretary of State for India notified [3044] the Viceroy on 19th June that the High Commissioners report, of 25th May conveyed the further information that three secret clauses were reported to exist. The sense of these clauses was that (1) the Afghan Government agreed to-the formation of an Islamic Confederation, and consented to become an independent member of it; the Turkish Government agreeing to the constitution in central Asia of a Council of representatives of inoslem republics, and to the apiDointment of an Afghan president thereof. (2) The Afghan Government agreed to contribute to the expenses of organizations in India, central Asia, Eastern Persia and Baluchistan for the purposes of revolutionary propaganda. The Afghan Government further agreed to strategical plans for offence and defence being drawn up by the Turkish military mission, and to the latter undertaking the reorganization and, when the time came, the command of the Afghan army. (3) The interference by a foreign Power in the administration of either party to be regarded as an attack on its own independence by the other, and mutual assistance in. material or moral to be undertaken.The Italian Agreement-See under &quot;Italy.&quot;ALBANIA.Ghimara [F.O.R., xlv, p. 4 (Greece)]. Mr. Eyres reported [No. 18] from Durazzo on 15th June that the population of Chimara had settled its differences with the Albanian Government and that complete accord had been established between them.ARABIA.IbwSaud and the Hejaz. Gn 25th June Lord, Allen by telegraphed [No. 430] a summary of a message he had received from King Hussein for transmission to Mr. Lloyd George. The King stated that he had been informed by the Governor of Medina that preparations were being made by Ibn Sand for attacking that place, and&apos; that Ibn Saud also threatened to proceed against the inhabitants of. Kora Kheibar if they refused to rebel against King Hussein. - The King said that he was.apprehensive for the safety of the 15,000 pilgrims who had just left Mecca for Medina, but was refraining from action on account of his friendship with His Majesty&apos;s Government. He suggested, ironically, that the latter should hand over the Hejaz to Ibn Saud as a recognition of that chieftain&apos;s great loyalty to them; this would not only secure the safety of the pilgrims but would also enable, him to abdicate, and he should greatly prefer abdication to the degradation he suffered at present.AUSTRIA.New Government. Telegraphing [No. 158] from Vienna on 22nd June, Mr. Lindley reported that Police-President Sehober had formed a new Government and taken over the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Christian Socialists could not form a Government.BELGIUM.The Leipzig Court. On 18th June Sir Geoige Grahame telegraphed [No. 128]: from Brussels us follows :  . The Minister of Justice protested in the Chamber yesterday against the acquittal by the Leipzig court of Max Ramdohr, accused of cruelty to Belgian children at
-Grammout daring the war.-He declared that the Belgian delegates at the trial -considered it a real travesty of justice. The acquittal had aroused general indignation in Belgium ; and the Belgian. Government had instructed their Minister at Berlin to protest against it, to remind the German Government that the cases before the Leipzig court had only been submitted as tests, and to say that the Belgian Govern-\meut intended to maintain their rights under articles 228 to 230 of the treaty of Versailles: M. Variderveldo added that the. Belgian Government would of course have to come to an agreement with the allied Governments in order to give efficacious &quot; sanctions &quot; to these rights ; but he knew that he was responding to the deep and unanimous feelings of the Belgian people in raising a most energetic; protest against the decision of the Leipzig court.FINLAND.The Island of Hogland. The following telegram [No. 105] was sent from Helsingfors by Mr. Rennie on 22nd June :  According to clause 14 of the treaty of Dorpat, Finland engages herself to take steps in view of (? group undecipherable) the neutral island of Hogland under an international guarantee.The Finnish Government have approached me to sound His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment as to whether they would be willing to guarantee the neutralization of the island according to the terms of the treaty.They are addressing a similar request to the French, Italian and,American Governments.FRANCE.The Eastern Volley of the Allies. On 24th June Lord Hardinge sent the following telegram [No. 406] from Paris:  The President of the Council yesterday gave to the Senate Commission on Foreign Affairs a very favourable account of the increasing solidarity between France, Great Britain, and Italy as regards their eastern&apos; policy, lie anticipated that the allies&apos; offer of mediation would be accepted, as the Turks&apos;aud the Greeks now realize that a fresh offensive would create a critical situation for both of them, and that the Turkish Government when re-established, with the necessary security and freedom, would again become an element of peace and a useful collaborator with France in her duties, influence and interests in the Levant. Complete agreement now exists between England and France regarding the Greek evacuation and the allied occupation of Smyrna. England consents to a fresh and full discussion about the status of Thrace; she is prepared&apos;to contemplate an eventual evacuation of Constan-tinople, and to accept certain modifications of the London agreements with a view to facilitating an understanding with Turkey. Being bound by the promises made to King Hussein when he took up arms against the Turks, she intends to give Emir Feisal the throne of Mesopotamia, but has assured France that she will guard against -any difficulty being thereby created for the French in Syria, and with this end in view has limited Emir FeisaPs power to Mesopotamia. Far from seeking to embarrass France in Syria, His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate establishing in. Transjordania (the region immediately adjoining French mandated territory) Emir Abdullah, who is better disposed towards France than his brother.GERMANY.Dr. Rathenau on the Situation. On 18th June Lord Kihnarnock telegraphed [No. 318] the following resume of a conversation he had had with Dr. Rathenau :-Dr.&apos; Rathenau told me that his interview with M. Loucheur had led to very fairly satisfactory results, and that he thought that the outcome was quite as good as could be expected. It had been a great advantage to discuss the whole question.personally with a French Minister, and M. Loucheur had. shown considerable understanding of the German point of view. Germany wished to pay as much as was possible of the sums due for reparation in the form of deliveries in kind, as this would avoid what, would otherwise be a severe disturbance of foreign exchanges. The French quite appreciated this, but it was necessary for them to receive a certain amount in money,
4owing to the fact that their proportion of the total reparations only amounted to 52 per cent.Dr. Rathenau also spoke very frankly about the situation of the present Cabinet.. He said that their position was not at all secure, and he repeated well-known arguments as to the necessity for enabling them to show some signs of success in order to secure the support of Parliament.   He said that, the French, attitude&apos;had: become more sympathetic, but that an impression had been created that the attitude-of England had changed for the worse.   This he attributed to the fact that great and., perhaps excessive hopes had been aroused by Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech on Upper Silesia.   People in Germany had understood that Germany was to be given a free-hand to defend her interests in Upper Silesia, whereas now it appeared that the-Polish insurgents and the self-defence corps were both classified by the inter-allied commission as being on the some footing.   This was considered a grave injustice, as the German corps had only come into existence after the Polish insurrection was in. full swing.   He thought that the Government might manage to scrape through the-impending debate on Silesia;  but unless the external position improved very materially within the next week or 10 days, the Cabinet would almost certainly fallv Any other Cabinet which succeeded it must be less satisfactory from the point of 1 view of -carrying out the ultimatum.   A change of Government must mean a change-of policy, and it would be a long time before such a constellation as at present existed could be restored if once it fell.Upper Silesia.The Inter-Allied Commission. Telegraphing [No. 314] from&apos; Berlin on 16th. June, Lord Kilmarnock reported as follows : The German Government take note of the communication which you made to-them yesterday; and recognize that the inter-allied commission is de jure the Government in Upper Silesia. They nevertheless draw attention to the fact that for the past six weeks the commission has not in fact exercised its power of government, over a large portion of Upper Silesia, and that, as a result of this, the German inhabitants of this district have been left unprotected to suffer from excesses-committed by the insurgents, such as arson, murder, forcible evacuation and plunder. This state of things still exists, and will in the opinion of the Gorman- Government continue to do so as long as the allied troops do not take energetic action against the insurgents and thoroughly clear the country of them. The self-defence corps under Hoeffer have protected certain districts from the fate of the remainder. The German Government, have succeeded in persuading Hoeffer to restrain his troops from taking offensive action. The German Government exercises no authority over Hoeffer, but--nevertheless cannot put to him the unreasonable request-that he should evacuate ;German villages and then watch them being destroyed by Polish bands under the-very eyes of his troops, and allow their inhabitants to be killed or ill-treated. Moreover the; complaints which have been made against Hoeffer seem now to have-lost their raison d&apos;etre as, according to both German and English reports, an agreement has already been arrived at between the general and one of the allied commanders.The German Government, who have given so many proofs of their goodwill and patience at the cost of the greatest sacrifices, would not, in our opinion, be able to remain in power if, contrary to the result of the plebiscite, the Upper Silesian question were solved in a manner unacceptable to Germany, or if the solution of this question were further postponed.Telegraphing [No. 322] again on 21st June Lord Kilmarnock reported as follows : The French Ambassador received serious news from Oppeln this morning to the-effect that the Germans had definitely refused the new plan of evacuation which has been proposed, and were setting up commissions with administrative powers in such a way as to constitute acts of open rebellion against the commission. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs had asked me to receive him at 1 o&apos;clock to discuss the situation, I took the opportunity of drawing his attention to these serious reports, and we went over all the ground again. I used every argument I could to induce him to bring pressure to bear on General Hoeffer and the committee of 12, and, at the same time,. endeavoured to show the advantages which Germany would gain if the plan were-
accepted, and to provide him with such meagre material as was available lor helping &apos; him to defend his position before the Reichstag.The&apos;French Ambassador saw him later in the day, and our combined arguments seemed to have produced the desired impression, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me after dinner and told me that the Cabinet had decided after a protracted discussion with the party leaders to make a strong effort to induce General fioeffer to agree to the plan proposed by the intei-allied commission. They are sending to Oppeln an official from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs accompanied by a deputy from each of the three governmental parliamentary parties.to bring pressure to bear in the sense desired. Meanwhile the Chancellor has again prevailed on the parties &quot;to postpone the interpellation in the Reichstag on the ground that fresh negotiations are in progress. The chief argument which has prevailed in obtaining the above is the fact that the new plan provides for the complete evacuation of the plebiscite area by the &apos; Polish insurgents within a period of from five to seven days.The. Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked me to give him a statement to this effect in writing, and I am addressing to him a signed memorandum.The French Ambassador has already given him a plan in writing. In view of this fresh proof of the goodwill of the German Government, I earnestly trust that the withdrawal of the Poles wifl.be effectively carried out within the time limit specified.. &quot;In regard to this Sir II. Stuart telegraphed [No. 220] from Oppeln as follows on 22nd June: The information of the French Ambassador is not correct. The Germans have not &quot;definitely refused the plan of evacuation and negotiations still continue ; nor have they acted in open rebellion against the commission by setting up commissions with administrative power.I asked M. le Rond about the information supplied to the French Ambassador and he said that there had been&apos;some misunderstanding. He had reported that General Hoeffer had said that he could not accept the plan, but would refer it to the political parties committee. This was clearly not a definite refusal. He presumed that the statement about the administrative commissions referred to a proclamation of the committee of 12 which was published in the Breslau newspapers of 18th June It deals only with recpiisitions and arrests, and its general effect is to check and bring-under some sort of control acts which are being done by the self-protection forces without authority. It is a gross exaggeration to describe thi?action as an administra-tion of territory occupied by the self-protection forces or as open rebellion against the-commission. If M. le Rond had held this view he would not have failed to say so -when he mentioned (? the proclamation) to me at Saturday&apos;s meeting of the commission.On 26th June Sir H. Stuart reported [No. 233] that both Poles and Germans had, signed an agreement for reciprocal withdrawal, which would be finally effected by .5th July.GREECE..The Indemnities Law.-On 22nd June Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 357] that he had received a long note in reply to his representations regarding the indemnities law which had been passed and gazetted.The note concluded with an expression of hope that His Majesty&apos;s Legation would recognize that the sole object of the Greek Government was to satisfy elementary justice and by no means to renounce their good-will towards the Allied Governments. The note believed that His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a &quot;friendly and allied Govern-ment,&quot; would be equally interested in the appeasement of public opinion, which demanded compensation for those who had suffered unjustly.ITALY.The Afghan-Italian Agreement. The following facts appear from a telegram [No. 257] sent by Lord Curzon to Sir George Buchanan on 13th June, and the latter&apos;s reply.[No..229] sent from Rome on the following da3v: Secret information, resting on the authority of. Mohammed Vali Khan himself, reached the British Government that the Afghan mission to Rome had concluded a29-5
treaty which awaited ratification; also that an Italian, mission would be sent to Kabul. When spoken to on the subject the Italian ambassador appeared to be unaware of the facts. Lord Curzon told him that, should the story be true, he could not conceal the painful impression it made upon him ; the professions of Count Sforza being in sharp discord with his acts, first in concluding a secret Kemalist agreement&apos;and now one with the Afghans. The British Government was negotiating a treaty with Afghanistan which&apos; would, reaffirm our predominant political interest in that country, and the attitude of an. ally in concluding an agreement of whatever character without informing them was surprising.When Sir George Buchanan took up the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the latter said that he feared there had been misunderstanding on both sides. Before receiving the Afghan mission he had made official inquiries of the British Government as to the status of Afghanistan and had been informed that that country enjoyed full sovereign rights. He had in consequence received the mission and signed a protocol recording the fact that Italy and Afghanistan desired to establish .direct commercial relations and authorizing the despatch of an Italian mission to Kabul to negotiate a commercial convention. He had not understood the nature of the treaty now being negotiated between Great Britain and Afghanistan, and had gathered from the British reply that he was at liberty to enter into negotiations on behalf of Italy. To prove that the mission had no political object he would instruct the Italian agent to do nothing except in agreement with the British agent. When Sir George Buchanan told him that the sending of such a mission would be setting a precedent which might gravely embarrass the British Government in the future, Count Sforza said that if the British Government held that view he would reconsider the matter, but were he to renounce the mission he would be accused of abandoning Italian interests, so he hoped that this would net be asked.Telegraphing again on 21 st June Lord Curzon informed [No. 205] Sir George Buchanan that Sir Eyre Crowe had suggested to the Italian Ambassador that His Majesty&apos;s Government expected to be further consulted before the mission actually started, and that the Italian Government would be wise if they delayed its despatch and. perhaps later abandoned it altogether.On 27th June Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 259] that Count Sforza had informed him that the departure of the Italian mission would, be suspended.Resignation of the Government. Telegraphing on 27th June [Nos. 250-258] Sir George Buchanan reported that on 26th June the Government obtained a majority of .34 in the chamber on a Socialist motion condemning its foreign policy. In spite of the majority Count Sforza decided to resign, his decision being due to the announcement that the Social Democrats would have voted against ihe Government had the question been merely that of the foreign policy. Signor Giolitti supported Count Sforza and the Government tendered its resignation. It. was reported that the King was urging Signoi Giolitti to stay, but the latter remained solid with Count Sforza and refused to reconsider his decision.JAPAN.The Minister- of Finance. The following telegram [No. 222] was sent from Tokio to Sir Charles Eliot on 10th June :-The press states that the Minister of Finance has printed a pamphlet, for private circulation among the high officials, in which he emphasizes Japahs need for raw . material, and the necessity for developing china&apos;s resources. He is said to condemn the vague attitude of the present Ministry ; and to advocate the cancellation of the 21 demands, and the formation of an economic alliance with China, even if it involves a break with the consortium.I made enquiries of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day, and he replied that if the Minister of Finance had given expression to such views, it was. in his private capacity only. He left, on me the impression that the Minister of Finance had urged, some such policy on his colleagues, but that it was not acceptable to them or at least to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. -The Minister of War.-On 10th. June Sir1 Charles Eliot reported [No. 221] that it had been officially announced that the Minister of War had resigned, and that General Yamanashi had been appointed his successor.
MOROCCO.Tangier [F.C.R., xtv, p. 5]. Ou 16th June Sir Esnie Howard reported [No. 129], from Madrid that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had spoken to him at great-length on the question, of the dahirs granted by the Sultan of Morocco.The Minister in the course of the conversation expressed the opinion that the concession of the port of Tangier without consulting the other Powers was the grossest violation of international treaty rights so far&quot; committed in Morocco by the French, and if the British and Spanish Governments allowed the concession to-materialize they might look on Tangier as a French possession. No one after this would talk of Germany alone as treating treaties as scraps of paper. Some steps, he .-said, must be taken without delay to end these continual French encroachments, which would continue so long.as the status of Tangier was not settled, and the French Government placed every difficulty in the way of the conference proposed by the Spanish and British Governments to that end. The Minister added that this action of the French Government had come as a still greater.shock to the Spanish Government because the latter had only recently concluded au arrangement with the, former for the repayment of the Spanish loan to France without requiring any compensation, on the terms asked for by France. -NORWAY.New Cabinet. On the 21st June Sir Mansfeldt Findlay telegraphed [No. 82] the list of a new cabinet formed by Mr. Otto Blehr : &apos; Mr. Blehr, Finance. Mr, 0. M. Mjelde, Public Works.Doctor   Arnold    Raestad,   Foreign        Mr. Olsen Nahun, Education.Affairs. General Aavatsmark, Defence.Mr. J. L. Mowinckel, Commerce. Mr. Olaf Amundsen, Justice.Mr. Lars Oftedal, Social Affairs.The Ministries of Agriculture and of Food have been offered to Mr. II. Five, who was at present in the United States ; if he refused the latter Ministry, it would -probably be offered to Mr. R. 0. Mortensen,PERSIA.Russian Influence. Telegraphing [No. 344] on 17th June, Mr. Norman reported thai, the Armenian Soviet Government of Erivan, prompted by the Russian Soviet -Government at the instigation of the Russian Minister at Teheran, had telegraphed to the latter requesting him to take charge of, Armenian interests pending the arrival of their representative. The Persian Government was officially informed of this request-at the same time. The&apos; present Armenian representative, who had received bis instructions from the anti-Bolshevik Armenian Government of Zangezur to maintain his position, had returned no answer to the request of the Russian Minister to name a day for handing over the Armenian legation.The Persians, who were much afraid of the Russian Minister, had taken no action up to the date of Mr. Norman&apos;s telegram. The Armenian representative, however, on the ground that the independence of Armenia as a non-Bolshevik State had been recognized by the allied and associated Governments, had asked for the support of the Belgian, British, French and United States legations, should the question become acute.Mr/Norman requested instructions as to his line of conduct in the matter.On 24th June Mr. Norman further reported [No. 352] that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Soviet Government of Azerbaijan had also asked the Russian Minister at Teheran, to take charge of their legation pending the arrival of their representative;-and that the legation had been handed over by the present Minister, who had been appointed by tin; anti-Bolshevik Azerbaijan Government.Although the&apos; Armenian, representative had received no official intimation from., the Persian Government, Mr. Norman considered.it evident, that they had ceased to recognize him. as no member oi the Armenian legation had been present at the opening of the Medjliss, which Air. Norman reported [No. 351] on 22nd June as. having taken place that day.29-5 C
POLAND.Tlie. Rumanian-Russian Peace Negotiations. On 17th Juue Mr. Max Mailer reported [No. 310] from Warsaw that the Polish Government had agreed that the Rumanian-Russian peace negotiations should take place in that city ; and that it was believed, that M. Karachan would be the head of the Soviet delegation.RUSSIA.Message from M. Chicherin. The following message was sent from Moscow by M. Chicherin on 17th dune :-The attention of the Russian Government has been drawn to certain proposals to be brought before the Council of the League of Nations regarding material, help to-so-called Russian refugees. The Soviet Government would not concern itself with the proposals were it convinced that they were prompted by purely humanitarian sentiments: Knowing, however, from experience that in many cases, under the cloak of philanthropy, actual support has been given in the past to counter-revolutionary-movements, the Russian Government feel bound to declare that it&apos; will regard&apos; as direct help to Russian counter-revolutionary forces any aid rendered to the remnants of Russian mutinous armies as long as they are kept in compact masses retaining their military organization and their subordination to their former commanders, or any aid given through the various so-called Russian committees of councils which, while-professing to care for Russian refugees, are in reality centres of counter-revolutionary activities. The Soviet Government firmly hopes that the British Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Anglo-Russian agreement, will not be a party to any such unfriendly acts towards Russia.SPAIN.The Ex-Emperor Earl. -On 25th June Mr. Wingheld reported [No. 137] from. Madrid that he, with the French and Italian ambassadors, had asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allow the Ex-Emperor of Austria to reside in Spain. The Minister replied that he would place the matter before his colleagues ; they were not anxious to have the Ex-Emperor there, and. should he come Spain could not consent to place herself, in the position of a gaoler, or to lay herself open to representations in regard to the measures adopted by her to watch over-, her visitor, lie further said that if the Ex-Emperor should come to Spain, he must be in a position to support himself in a becoming manner, and this charge should not fall entirely on the Spanish Government.TURKEY.The Command of the Allied Troops. On 19th June Lord Curzon telegraphed; [No. 380] as follows from Paris to Sir Eyre Crowe :-An agreement was reached this morning with the French by which General Harington will assume the imniediatecoimnand of the allied troops in Constantinople ;-the necessary instructions are being sent by the French Government to General Charpy.It was further agreed that the military commission should supervise three sub-commissions : (I.) A sub-commission of control presided Over by an Italian officer ;(2) A sub-commission of gendarmerie; presided over by a French officer ;,(3) A sub-commission of &quot;special elements&quot; presided over by a British officer.It was also agreed that the post of permanent secretary-general of the Financial Commission should be attributed to a Frenchman, and the post of inspector-general of Customs to a British official; a third analogous post will probably be devised for an Italian in order to maintain the principle of equal distribution.The, Italian Ambassador here was unable to accept the above arrangement without instructions from Rome, but is submitting it immediately to his Government,, and I do not apprehend any difficulty on their part.The Kemalists. Telegraphing [Mo. 430] on loth June, Mr. Rattigan said that the Constantinople Turks were panic stricken at the idea of Great Britain supporting-Greece, and were doing their utmost to impress upon the Kemalists the&apos;need for
abating the extremist policy. At the same time they were trying to prove to ns that the Kemalists sincerely desired to turn over a new leaf; but he feared that it was a case of the wish being father to the thought.The Angora Government.The Visit of Beltir Sami to France. On 19th June Lord llardiiige telegraphed [No. 393] from Paris that the Rome correspondent of the Matin had reported the following declarations made to him by Bekir Sami on arriving there on the 18th :-My mandate is to enlighten France on the real intentions and objects of the Angora Government.   I will try to dissipate certain prejudices and to explain fully the motives for our present action.   I also firmly hope (and in this I interpret the feeling of the whole national assembly) to arrive at an agreement with your country, which is always regarded amongst us as a traditional friend of Turkey.   The agreement which I signed with France.has not been ratified by our parliament, but neither has it been definitely rejected.   I have reason to believe that one of the results of my journey will be to bring into force a treaty some clauses of which will perhaps have been modified by common agreement.   As I explained to the Supreme Council in London, the Turks desire not only the independence of strictly Turkish territory, but also financial and economic independence.   France need have no fear of any interference by us in Syria, Mesopotamia, or elsewhere (these regions not being Turkish), nor of action by us on the Cilician front.   England, according to press reports, is disposed to suggest the evacuation of Smyrna and all Asia Minor ; this solution seems to me sound in principle and, subject to examination in detail, capable of being favourably received by the Turks.   As regards our alleged alliance with Moscow, much false information is published as emanating from Kemalist sources ; but I will say with all frankness that as neighbours of the Russians it is our interest to live on friendly terms with them, and friendship exists between the two nations.   Being at grips with the Greeks, who aspire to enslave us, we have a Turkish army which in the future as in the past will do its duty.   As for the help which Moscow may have been led to offer us in critical circumstances, we have a proverb which says &quot; A man fallen into the sea will even grasp at serpents.&quot;Overtures to General ILirington. On 22nd June Lord Curzon informed Lord Hardinge [No. 341] and Sir George Buchanan [No. 2G7] that Mustapha Kemal had offered to send a general officer to Ineboli on the Black Sea, to converse with General Harington ; and he instructed them to communicate this fact to the Governments to which they were accredited and to add that His Majesty&apos;s Government, not being -favourably inclined to conversations with secondary persons, proposed, should the French and Italian Governments concur, to reply that a British representative would be prepared to meet Mustapha Kemal himself on the Black Sea. General Haringtori held the view that Mustapha Kemal should state his case in person in Constantinople : the intermediary through, whom the offer was made said in reply to this suggestion that neither Mustapha Kemal nor his representative dared to goto Constantinople, and that Mustapha Kemal himself was practically confined to Angora by die extremists.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Obligations of Foreign Governments-On 24th June Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 437] that, at the request of the President, Senator Pen rose had intro-ducecl a bill drafted by the Secretary of the Treasury empowering the latter to extend the time of payment of the principal or interest, or both, of any obligation of any foreign Government arising out of the war, and to refund, or convert such obligations into bonds or other obligations of the same or of any other foreign Government. Sir Auckland added that it was reported that some objection was felt to the- last clause as making it possible for German reparation bonds to be accepted as security from the allied Governments.The Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The following telegram [No. 435] was sent by -Sir Auckland Geddes on 24th June : As a result of the reports of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference published in this country, interest in the question of the renewal of the Anglo-
Japanese alliauce is considerably increased both in political and newspaper circles... As is not infrequently the case, an acrimonious triangular discussion is proceeding between the State Department, a newspaper agency, and the press geuerally as to the accuracy or inaccuracy of a press statement that the United States Government is being kept informed of the progress of the negotiations betwreeu His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Japanese Government which are assumed to be proceeding; and much is being made of a communique issued by the State Department to the effect that it has no information. This leads to headlines such as &quot; Mystery of Anglo-Japanese Treaty,&quot; &quot; Britain Ignores United States of America.&quot;They are being made use of to stir up still further the American feeling against any form of special Anglo-Japanese relations of friendship or co-operation.There can be no doubt that American opinion regards even the thought of the renewal of the treaty as evidence that British protestations of friendly feeling towards the United States of America are insincere. It has to be remembered that the American people think, of Japan in the same way as many British thought of the Germans iii .1913 as the inevitable enemy of the next war, and view a British association with Japan, now as we should have viewed an American association with Germany at that time.
