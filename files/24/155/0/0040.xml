ARGENTINA.The New President. On 12th October Sir Claude Mallet reported that Senor Alvear had assumed the presidency the day before, and had appointed Dr. Lebreton Acting-Minister of Foreign Affairs, pending the return of Dr. Gallardo, Argentine Minister at Rome, who would take over tbe portfolio.AUSTRIA.Financial Reform. On 10th. October Mr. Akers Douglas reported as follows : In accordance with protocol 3 of the League of Nations scheme, a Bill will be laid before Parliament on 12th instant for full powers for the Government to allow the financial reform programme. The Chancellor tells me that he is sure this will pass, and that meanwhile the question is being considered whether a two-thirds majority is required by the Austrian constitution for this purpose. If so, the social democrats (who are making a great fuss about the &quot; elimination of Parliament &quot; but will probably accept the situation) will have to vote for the Pill. In that case they may demand a price which may be the resignation of the present Chancellor.The Government is pleased with the results of Geneva, and feels sure that the country is behind them in endorsing all the conditions.Meanwhile the Chancellor has strongly impressed on me the desirability of an Englishman being in the commission which comes next week to study conditions and draw up a programme of first financial reforms, in conjunction with, the financial Ministry.CHILE.Goal. The following telegram was sent by Mr. Bateman on 13th. October; : ,The state railways have refused a renewal of the contracts with the national coal companies, as foreign coal is being increasingly imported much cheaper. Some mines have already closed down, and. the national, companies are again clamouring for an import duty on foreign coal and petroleum.The United States Ambassador has promised to make joint representations with me if a Bill should be introduced, which is likely, as the coal companies are very influential..&quot; CHINA.Intelligence Report. On 4th October Sir Ueilby Alston sent the following monthly intelligence report :-The Government have momentarily tided over the financial crisis connected with the autumn settling clay, 5th October, by means of an internal loan, at about 15 per cent., secured on the suspended portion of the Russian indemnity funds.A new acting-cabinet was appointee! by a presidential mandate on 21st September; The efforts to induce Tang Shao-yi to head the administration have been abandoned and Wang Chung-hui has been definitely appointed acting Premier. Koo is Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Cabinet is predominantly young China and entirely dependent on Wu-Pei-fu and Tsao-kun, who as the price of support demanded 3,000,000 dollars before 5th October. Only one portfolio, not yet accepted, has been assigned to the south. -Parliament, which adjourned on 18th September for a month without having accomplished anything, is supposed to be engaged on drafting a constitution, pending the completion of wdiich no progress towards unification is expected.Chang Tso-lin has obtained a large supply of arms from Siberia. Wu-Pei-fu is strengthening his military position. Sun-Yat-sen in Shanghai is in touch with ali parties including the Bolshevik emissary. The civil war in Szechuen has ceased and, apart from the usual brigandage and some trouble with remnants of Sun!s anti-north expedition in Kiang-si and Fukien, the provinces are nominally at peace.
On 14th October Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed as follows in regard to the last-paragraph in the above telegram : The trouble in Fukien has developed into a serious rebellion against ths Govern-ment by the remnants of Sun Yat-sen&apos;s forces under the leadership of the notorious Anfu General Hsu Shu-cheng. The rebel force, which is alleged to have the support of Sun Yat-sen, Chang-Tso-lin and the former Anfu&apos; party, captured Foochow -on 12th October, and proclaimed a new Government.The British, American and Japanese naval guards have been landed at Foochow, but so far no disorders have occurred;Loans and the Telegraphs. In reply to a telegram from the Foreign Office, on 4th October.Sir Beilby Alston expressed the opinion that international control over. the telegraphs and their revenues on, say, postal lines, would, of course, be excellent if feasible, but there was no indication that China would consent to this. Loans to China were only safe if secured on revenues collected under foreign supervision and paid into foreign banks. To say that this loan would be &quot; secured &quot; on telegraph revenues meant nothing without such supervision.Arms Embargo.- On 5th October Sir Beilby Alston reported that the following identic telegram was being sent by the representatives in Peking to their respective Governments : As regards the arms embargo, the Corps Diplomatique unanimously approved of the Washington formula &quot; arms or munitions of war whether complete or in parts &quot; ; but they could not agree on any modification of that language for the purpose of extending or strengthening the prohibition. They unanimously agreed, however, to submit to their respective Governments the following interpretation of the note :  This is understood to include aircraft, other than commercial aircraft, and machinery -and materials destined exclusively for the manufacture of arms or the equipment of an arsenal.On 7th October he telegraphed further as follows : My telegram of 5th October was sent, as the result of a meeting summoned to discuss the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I have done my utmost to urge on my colleagues the. importance of widening the embargo,: but the majority are sceptical and the general impression exists that the embargo is more or less of a farce.   I. submit the following observations on the identic telegram : (1) The Washington formula only prohibited export, to China. We alone prohibit import into and sale in China and alone have had the requisite authority to enforce the terms of the 1919 embargo.(2) Unless and until a recognized Government in Russian Siberia becomes a party to the embargo there must continue to be serious leakage. Large quantities of arms have been sold to Manchuria, and my colleagues have no power to prevent their nationals taking part in this trade.(3) Proposals as to questions of personnel in arsenals and the inclusion of all aircraft were ruled out by the meeting as unattainable.There is growing dissatisfaction, which may be voiced at meetings in November of the Chamber of Commerce, at the much wider and stricter interpretation given to the embargo by His Majesty&apos;s Government than by other Powers. It may be said that tlie 1919 embargo has saved China a little money but has not had any effect whatever in stopping civil war.  -Munitions in Siberia. The following message was sent by Sir Beilby Alston on 12th October :-His Majesty&apos;s consul-General at Mukden reports the arrival on 3rd October of a. further 15 cars of munitions oE war, including 5,000 shells and 5,000 bombs, by the South Manchurian Railway! presumed to be part of Chang Tso-lin&apos;s purchase from, the Vladivostock Government.The development of the Mukden arsenal is also proceeding rapidly, though the machinery from Denmark has not yet been delivered. and may be detained by the Chinese customs. The latter cannot effectively control importation from Siberia, however, and, if this continues with Japanese connivance and help as regards transport, Chang Tso Jin&apos;s military strength will be greatly increased and the prospect of another civil war next spring enhanced.[See under Japan.]
on 7th October he gave the following list of the newCZECHO-SLOVAKIA.New Cabinet. On 5th October Sir George Clerk reported that the-Cabinet had&apos; resigned that evening and that a new Government had been constituted under the leadership of M. Svehla.Telegraphing again ministry:  M. Svehla M. Benes .&apos; M, Malypetr , M. Udrzal .    .   -M. Dolansky M. Basin M. Stribrny M. Tucny M. BechynePrime Minister. Foreign Affairs.. Interior.National Defence.Justice.Finance.Railways.Posts.Education.M. Hodza M. Novak -M. Srba M. Habrman-M. Sramek -M. Franke -M. Markowic M. Kallay   -Agriculture. Commerce. Public Works. Social Welfare.. Health. Food.Unification. Slovakia.EGYPT.The International Conference. Gn 11th October Lord Allenby reported that he had received from the Egyptian Government a request that Egypt should be-invited to send a representative to the forthcoming international conference on Near East questions, believed to be on 1st November at Prinkipo... jje added that he considered that it was most important to agree to this and hoped that he might be authorized to inform the Prime Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government acquiesced.To this Lord Curzon replied as follows on 14th October : You should inform the Egyptian Government that the technical basis of the present conference is the revision of the treaty already signed with Turkey and that the signatories of that treaty were Powers who had either declared war on, or broken off relations with&apos; Turkey.-,! It is impossible, therefore, at this stage to give any undertaking that Egypt will be admitted as a signatory of the final treaty of peace.On receipt of this Lord Allenby telegraphed that he strongly urged that he should be authorized somewhat to modify the tenour of the reply to Sarwat Pasha and to inform him that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the presence at the meeting place of the conference of a representative of the Egyptian Government, and that while the eventuality of Egypt being invited to sign the treaty appeared to be excluded by the considerations mentioned by Lord Curzon, His Majesty&apos;s Government would support her doing so should those considerations cease to be operative.Proposed Revision of the IVeaty of Sevres. On 14th October Lord Curzon informed Lord Allenby that the following were the suggested modifications of the treaty of Sevres as regards Egypt: Article 101, substitute for last sentence : &quot; Turkey hereby accepts the status of Egypt as defined in the declaration of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to His .Majesty the Sultan of Egypt on the 28th February 1922.&quot;Articles 102 and 103, for &quot;18th December 1914&quot; read &quot;5th November 1914,&quot;Article 104, insert after &quot;treaty&quot; in first line the words &quot;apart from Article 261.&quot;Article 107, omit.Article 108, insert at beginning, &quot;Pending the conclusion of a commercial convention between Egypt and Turkey.&quot;Article 428, omit in first paragraph and in sub-section (fc) the words &quot; or by the Alexandria Maritime and Quarantine Board,&quot; and also in first paragraph the words &quot; and in any territories which cease in accordance with the present treaty to be under the suzerainty of Turkey.&quot; Insert at end of the Article between the words-;&quot;Pilgrimage will be represented&quot; and &quot; on a co-ordinating Pilgrimage Quarantine Committee &quot; the words &quot; together with the Sanitary Maritime and Quarantine Board, of Egypt.&quot;
GERMANY,The Financial Crisis. The following report was sent by Lord d&apos;Aberh&apos;qh oh. 10th October :- -The financial crisis continues to get worse. Notes are,poured out from ;the printing press in an unceasing stream and the mark.has fallen to 13.000 to the,pound sterling. The only improvement discernible is the fact that some writers in the press are beginning to admit a possible connexion between the quantity of notes issued and the value of those notes, but this view has not yet permeated official or Reichsbank circles. The salient and relatively hopeful fact is that the present value of the total note issues at the current exchange is only 25,000,000 sterling, whereas the Reichsbank gold reserve is approximately 50,000,000 sterling. There is twice the amount of gold to guarantee the present currency in circulation at the present exchange level. -It should therefore be possible to devise a scheme to ensure stability at a rale materially above the present, but I doubt whether the German Government are capable either of devising, or of carrying through, any such scheme without external advice and, assistance either from the bankers&apos; committee, or some other body, or from foreign experts called in to advise.GREECE.,, : The . Mudania Agreement.-0\x 13th October Mr. Lindley reported, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had just communicated to him the.text of the declaration to be made by the Greek High Commissioner.at Constantinople to the allied High -Commissioners, of which the following was a translation :  i.^The Greek Government considers that the declarations made by the Greek -delegates at Mudania should have been taken into consideration especially regarding the guarantees and the delegations strictly necessary for the safety of the lives and property of the Christian popidations of eastern Thrace.The Greek Government makes a final appeal to the sentiments of humanity of the allied Powers in favour of these populations. . -Desiring, nevertheless, to conform to the decisions of the Powers, the Greek -Government see themselves obliged to submit, and declare that they adhere to the armistice protocol signed at Mudania on.11th October. .      ,  . , ...On 17th October Mr. Lindley telegraphed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had asked him that morning if he could do nothing to get the Allies to interpret the Mudania agreement in such a sense as would allow some delay between the date for the departure of the&apos; Greek military forces and the. arrival of the Turkish gendarmerie. -That.was, he said,; the only hope-of saving a catastrophe. ,,Evacuation of Thrace and Asia Minor. On 10th October Mr. Lindley reported that the Thracian deputy, M. Antoniades, deputed by the Greek Government to deal with the evacuation of the Greek population of Thrace, had called that morning before leaving for Constantinople, and had given the following information : There are 148,000 Asia Minor refugees in eastern Thrace. There are also 220,000 Christian inhabitants without counting those in the regions of Karagatch and Demotinea, of which there are 20,000. It is physically impossible to evacuate all these within a month, especially if they are allowed.to.take their, agricultural imple-merits which are necessary to their future life. He hoped,, therefore,, that the, period of evacuation would be prolonged to; three months. He laid particular stress on the necessity for avoiding a panic which would probably produce massacres of Turks. He hoped, therefore, that some assurance, would be given to the population that they would be unmolested for a certain period. He asked whether I thought it possible&apos; for the, population to remain, as evacuation even in the,best conditions would mean ruin and great loss of life. I said that I could;give no.opinion, but that it was in the: interests of the population to remain if they safely ;couhl. Finally he, expressed great fear of the Turkish gendarmerie who seem to be chosen for ferocity, The limitation of their numbers was absolutely necessary.if; On 14th October i Mr.. Lindley further reported that the . Ministry, of ;publie Assistance had given him the following information that morning :-The evacuation of refugees- from Edremid will be- finished to-morrow.  -At-Adalia and Makri, the ports designated for the concentration of refugees, there are 25,000 45-3 b
Tefugees; three Greek ships have been sent to these ports. At the Asiatic ports of&quot; the Sea of Marmora 80,000 are concentrated. Four Greek ships have been sent. The Ministry reckon 2,000 refugees to one of. their ships.I presume that the Greek ships will be fully employed transporting refugees from Thrace during the next month, so that the bulk of transport from Asia Minor will have to be done by others. I regret that I can give no clearer indication as to. the amount of British tonnage required...   . ITALY.The Dodecanese. Sir Ronald Graham reported as follows on 9th October: The Greek Minister informs me that the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs sent, for him yesterday; and, told him that in view of the new situation in the Near East which differed substantially from that existing at the time of the treaty of Sevres, the,Italian Government considered, their special arrangement with Greece regarding the Dodecanese as cancelled.The Greek Minister, who was taken completely by surprise, protested that there-was no change except for the Greek evacuation of Asia Minor which the Powers had approved in March last. Further, that Count Sforza, when Minister for Foreign Affairs, had informed M. Gonalis (sic) that Italy would return the islands to Greece.The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that if the islands were handed back to-Greece, the population would be exposed to clanger from Turks, and then declined to-discuss the question further.- : The above information is confirmed in a Stefani communique which has just, appeared. There seems to be no doubt that the action of the Italian Government has been dictated to them by the Fascisti party.JAPAN.Munitions in Siberia. -The following report was sent by Sir Charles Eliot on 6th October: &apos; * This morning I called on the United States Ambassador, who expressed his personal desire to join in the representations, but is awaiting instructions from his. Government. As the matter is urgent I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs at once. -He said that-the Japanese, Government were most unwilling that ammunition should pass into the hands of Chang Tso-lin, and were anxious to destroy or remove it if possible.   But the difficulties are very great.(1) The Japanese Government do not see their way to retain troops after the date-fixed for evacuation. I gathered that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not particularly object to this, but that the Cabinet as a whole opposed delay., (2) The British and American as well as the Japanese military and naval authorities agree that the process of removal will take a long time, because the-ammunition is in various stores, some of which are several miles from the wharves.1(3).The Russians, whether, red or white, object to interference with the-ammunition, and might oppose by force.. The Minister for Foreign Affairs can suggest only two plans in which Japan would be willing to take part:  ;(1) To send more men-of-war and land sufficient marines to guard the arms and superintend their destruction or throwing into the sea.   I pointed out that neither the United States nor His Majesty&apos;s Government favoured the plan,. -   but he replied that it had the advantage of time. !- (2) To hire merchant vessels at once to remove the ammunition and place it on ;some island, or throw it into the sea.   The cost to be defrayed by the Governments interested. The greatest difficulty of all is that ho Japanese department which can arrange-practical measures is. inclined to take the matter in hand energetically.The naval attache, military attache, and myself agree that the only practical course-is to press the Japanese Government to delay-the evacuation of a part of their troops. The United States Ambassador said that he did not think that his Government would object. . - -       .
-    A further report was sent by Sir Charles on 11th October : -The United States Ambassador has received no instructions, but has spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his own initiative. It is now recognized that the second plan mentioned in my telegram of 6th October is not practical. The Minister for Foreign Affairs states that the Japanese Government are not willing to delay evacuation in order to destroy the ammunition, but are still willing to consider the first plan should His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government change their minds. Since nearly all the Japanese ammunition has been removed, the Japanese Government consider that they cannot reasonably be called on to alter their plans in order to destroy ammunition deposited by other Powers, and that they will be doing all that can be expected if they assist us to destroy it.The Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks there is a movement against General Dietrichs at Vladivostock, and that he will probably fall before evacuation is complete.Hence the ammunition will probably pass into the hands of ihe Reds. They are less likely to sell it to Chang Tso-lin, but they may send it to Russia.The Alinister for Foreign Affairs evidently wishes to resume negotiations with, the Reds. He said this may be possible when Eastern Siberia and Chita are united with the Moscow Government.On 13th October Sir Charles further reported as follows : It was only to-day that the United States Ambassador received instructions. They state that the United States Government are unwilling either to land troops at ATadivostock or to press the Japanese to delay evacuation, and the Ambassador is merely authorized to ask that Japanese troops may destroy as much ammunition as possible before departure. I am joining in this request as it seems better than nothing.The United States Ambassador thinks that the Japanese will remove a con-siderable number of rifles for their own use. He also thinks that considerable quautities of munitions of war besides Czecho-Slovak stores have been sent to Chang Tso-lin.Ou the following day he again telegraphed as follows : The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the Japanese troops cannot destroy the munitions of war unaided (? group omitted) evacuation, because the danger of provoking a conflict with the Russians is greater than the advantage of destroying the small quantity possible in the time left. The Japanese Government would be ready to take part in any international action for removing munitions of war before evacuation, but they recognize that this offer is a mere formality since the United States will not join and also the time is insufficient. They propose to hand over the munitions of war to the municipality of ATadivostock and not to General Dietrich.On 9th October Sir Charles informed the Foreign Ollice that His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Vladivostock had reported as. follows :-(1) The Vladivostock Government have appealed to the Japanese commandant to hand over all munitions of war by 15th October, otherwise they will be compelled to take &quot; corresponding decisions.&quot; The Government state that they can guard against the &quot;explosion of munitions of war by the Reds,&quot; provided they are handed over before evacuation.(2) The Japanese have apparently decided to hand munitions of war to the municipality (sulphuric), but the transfer of the most dangerous portion will be delayed as long as possible. The stores consist chiefly of ammunition unsuitable for available rifles and guns and of chemicals which cannot be readily utilized.[See under &quot; China,&quot;]PERSIA.The Press Campaign [F.C.R., lxxix, p. 8].-Telegraphing on 5th October Sir Percy Loraine expressed his views of the gravity of the situation created by the attacks of the press, instigated by the Russians in Teheran. The latter were taking advantage of Kemafs successes and were doing their utmost to undermine British influence in Persia and to force recognition of the Soviet Government. Various factors, such as the impotence of the Persian Government, its financial instability and economic decline, the venality of the press, and the weight in the Medjliss of the anti-British party, contributed to strengthen their hands, and to enable them to
influence public opinion.. The primary aim of the press campaign was to break up relations between Great Britain and Persia, and the ultimate object to net Persia into a-n Islamic combination under Russian control.... Nevertheless, there existed a numerous pro-British party, who, in consequence, of the tolerant attitude of the British Government, had been brought to favour the . connexion, with Great Britain, rather than with Russia.   Failing a strong lead, however, the intimidation, to,,which they were subjected prevented those who held these views from giving expression to them.In. a later telegram Sir Percy said that he thought that the return of the Shah and the arrival of business advisers would eventually tend to stabilize the position, but in the meantime it was imperative that something should be done to counteract the Russian manoeuvres. Pie advocated the creation of. a press which would conduct a counter-campaign, and afford protection for those of bur friends who wished to make their voice heard.Telegraphing again on the same date, Sir Percy reported the increased gravity of the situation, owing to the publication, in the principal journal subsidized by the Russians, of a direct denial of the facts recorded in an official statement by Sir Percy Loraine, published, with his consent, by the Prime Minister.&apos; Sir Percy officially called the attention. of the Prime Minister to the matter as insulting to the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and personally appealed to him, as a last warning, to terminate a situation which had become unbearable. He pointed out that their offensive attacks were the deliberate and disgraceful method adopted by the Bolsheviks to effect a rupture between Great Britain and Persia, and besought him to consider what might be the results if a feeble Persian Government allowed it to succeed.The Prime Minister, admitted the,gravity of the situation and undertook to consult the president of the Medjliss and the leading members as to the measures to be taken, and to acquaint Sir Percy with the results.Referring to the foregoing message, sir percy Loraine sent the following telegram on 10th October :  Under pressure from the Prime Minister, the editor of the offending newspaper has published an expression of regret, not a very generous one, but perhrfps sufficient to produce the desired effect locally. His Highness expects in the next two or three days to pass through the Medjliss an emergency law constituting a jury for the trial of press offences......The Political Situation.  On 7th October Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed that thefeeling in the Medjliss against the Minister of War had latterly increased, and that an attack had been levelled against him in Parliament. The movement against him appeared to be within the cognizance of the Russian representative. There seemed to be wide fears.of a coup oVetat by the Minister of War, and Sir Percy, in anticipation of such action, had endeavoured to communicate with the Minister of War,, and to urge on him the necessity of exercising greater restraint.Telegraphing on 10th October, Sir Percy Loraine reported an easier situation, and the probability of a compromise being arrived at between the Minister of War and the Mecljliss. The advice which Sir Percy had managed to convey to the former through the Oriental Secretary had apparently borne good fruit, although the effects might be easily dispelled by malign influences. The Minister of War had repudiated the suggestion that he was considering any action against the Medjliss, or con-contemplating resignation. He had referred to the necessity of paying the troops and the want of proper financial arrangements. Finally he had appealed for financial assistance.Sir Percy Loraine reported on 11th October that- he had had a personal conversation with the Minister of War, and had retained, the impression that/the latter had at length realized. that an amicable understanding with Great Britain was essential to a sound Persian policy.On 14th October Sir Percy Loraine sent the following telegram :--The differences between, the Minister of War and the Medjliss have been settled. The former-gave way on the main, points very much on the lines of my advice.
The Sliah&apos;s Visit to Europe, Sir Esme Howard telegraphed from Madrid on 10th October as follows :  The Shah of Persia, accompanied by the Persian Minister in Paris (who while here has been given the special rank of Ambassador), arrived in Madrid this morning, and will stay for three days at the Royal Palace at the special invitation of the King of Spain. Newspapers, in welcoming the Shah, generally point out that the visit has no political significance.RUSSIA.The Rejection of the Urquhart Agreement. On 11th October Lord d&apos;A.bernom telegraphed from Berlin as follows : In a published interview M. Litvinoff states that the rejection of the Urquhart agreement by Russia was mainly clue to resentment at the attitude of England regarding the representation of Russia at the Dardanelles conference. Russia knew that her exclusion from the conference was due to English initiative at the Paris meeting, which was proof that the anti-Russian influences in the English Cabinet had. got the upper hand. This indicated a change in the Englishman hostile to Russia and shut out the possibility of the improved relations which the Urquhart agreement had been intended to initiate. The Russian Government had hesitated to reject the Urquhart agreement, and had deferred the rejection for a fortnight after the Paris conference to give the British Government an opportunity to make good the mistake and to revert to a basis permitting permanent peace in the East. As, however-, the British Government had not cleared up the misunderstanding, and had left notes of the Soviet Government on this subject unanswered, nothing remained but to refuse&apos; ratification.To this Lord Curzon replied on 12th October : The attitude taken up by M. Litvinoff in the interview to which you refer is both mendacious and absurd. Russia has not been excluded from the Dardanelles conference. On the contrary, it was recognized at Paris that the Straits question . could not be &quot;settled unless she were admitted to the discussion; and we are now considering with our Allies plans by which this can best be brought about. On the other hand, when the conference to conclude peace between Turkey and the Allied Powers still at war with her-which is an independent question was under discussion at Paris, no initiative was taken by England or indeed by anyone in proposing the exclusion of Russia. It was not necessary even to consider the point, for the obvious reason that Russia is not a belligerent and that with the bulk of the questions affecting Turkey, with which the Peace. Conference will have to deal, she has nothing whatever to do. As a matter of fact, as far back as 29th September we were given to understand that the French Government objected to the presence either of Russia or Bulgaria at the approaching conference. M. Litvinoffs excuse is therefore merely a piece of political blackmail, characteristic of its author and of Soviet methods in general. . .Siberia.Whites and Reels.-On 13th October Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed that His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Viadivostock had reported that, after heavy fighting near Spassky, the Whites had been outnumbered and driven south by the Reds. Communication with Harbin was broken. The VJadivostock Government had failed to raise the money for the army, and the spirit of the public and of the recruits was poor. The general opinion was that it was only a question of time before the Whites retreated into Manchuria. .On 17th Uctober Sir Charles Eliot informed the Foreign Office that His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Viadivostock had reported that General Dietrich intended to withdraw the bulk of his forces, which included 15 small vessels, to Possiet Bay. The families of the Ural Cossacks would accompany them. The public, the Consul added, regarded resistance as a waste of life and feared Red reprisals. The labouring class was in sympathy with the Reds.In a later telegram sent on the 17th Sir Charles reported that the Consul at Viadivostock had telegraphed as follows : The struggle is over and the Whites have been definitely defeated. Nikolsk fell into the hands of the Reds yesterday and they are shortly expected to reach the boundary of the neutral zone. The main part of the White army is falling, back on Possiet.Munitions-See above, under &quot; China &quot; and &quot; Japan.&quot; 45-3 . - -
TURKEY.Financial Position. On 15th October Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed as follows :  The financial position of the Constantinople Government is momentarily easier. The Ottoman Bank has consolidated its previous advances by an advance of  T. .1,500,000 in current account,  T. 313,000 of which is a new cash advance.On the other hand the declaration which the Angora Government is reported to have published to the effect that all acts, treaties, contracts and official decisions of the Constantinople Government since March 1920, including its financial operations, are to be considered as null and void is not calculated to facilitate the task of finding in future money for the Constantinople Government.Arrest of Christi.ans.-On .8th October Sir Horace Rumbold reported from Constantinople that the Turks had started arresting Christians there, especially in the Asiatic suburbs, where Kemalist influence wa,s strong. He considered this to be intolerable while the allied occupation lasted. He had sent a very strong message to Jhe Grand Vizier and would see him to-morrow. Diplomatic pressure alone, however, would produce but little result: he was in communication with the General Officer Commanding as to other action.. .British Subjects and Smyrna. The following message was sent by Sir Horace Rumbold on 16th October : I caused Hamid to be asked on 12th October whether the employes of the Aidin railway and the Eastern Telegraph Company and British subjects generally could return to Smyrna with security for personal liberty and liberty to carry on business. He promised to telegraph to Angora.   I asked for an early reply in explicit terms;I have consulted the vice-consul at Smyrna independently. He replies that the Vali states that all British subjects temporarily absent are free to return to take possession of property and recommence business. The vice-consul favours the return of British subjects having property without their families. He suggests that as the Aidin railway is requisitioned and the Eastern Telegraph Company&apos;s office burnt, the presence of managers without staffs is sufficient for the moment.I will press Hamid for a definite reply. Meanwhile I think the vice-consuFs report justifies the advice to British subjects having property or urgent business to return, provided they are prepared to&apos; take a moderate risk.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Drastic Prohibition Proposals. On 7th October Sir Auckland Geddes reported as follows : This morning the press publishes a ruling laid down by the Attorney-General in response to a request of the Secretary of the Treasury, and with reference to the recent Walker and Anchor Line decisions by the Supreme Council, to the effect that under existing legislation (Volstead) it is illegal for American vessels, whether publicly or privately owned, to carry intoxicating liquor anywhere or in any waters, while it is equally illegal for foreign vessels to bring such liquor within the three-mile limit even in a sealed bar.In a letter dated yesterday addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury, the President notifies the former that Shipping Board vessels are being instructed to observe this ruling, and requests that masters of privately owned ships operating under the American flag may receive a similar warning. The letter continues : &quot; You will note that the ruling holds possession or transportation of all intoxicating liquors by foreign ships in American waters to be contrary to the decision of the court. You will therefore proceed to the formulation of regulations for the enforcement of law and such notice to.the agents of foreign shipping lines touching American ports or docking therein as becomes the circumstances, and commits us to the full enforce-ment of the law.&quot;The press reports indicate that a reasonable time will be given before enforcing the new ruling as regards foreign ships, and that the administration will give facilities for bringing test cases before the Supreme Court if desired.Although both I myself and the members of my staff have had conversations with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury within the last few days on the liquor question, we have not been afforded the slightest indication of any intention to take this drastic step.The main motive is probably to win the support of the &quot; Drys &quot; for the Ship Subsidy Bill, but the Administration probably also think it desirable to take a definite stand on the dry platform in forthcoming elections. The prohibition issue has recently been bulking largely in the Ohio Presidents home State.
0D 176itScrapping of Battlesiiips [F.C.R., lxxix, p. 10]. The following instructions were sent to Sir Auckland Geddes on 14th and 16th October: The decision of the United States Government, if persisted in, must gravely prejudice the British naval position, and destroy the principle of equality which was the essential basis of the treaty.Though none of the signatories are legally bound, by the treaty until all the ratifications have been deposited, the Powers chiefly concerned, namely, the British Empire, the United States and Japan, have all ratified; France and Italy alone not having done so. Neither of these two latter has to scrap any capital ships before 1930; consequently, their delay in ratification in no way affects the relative strengths of the signatories in. battleships. The suspension of scrapping by the United States Government, pending ratification by France and Italy is, therefore, not justified on naval grounds, while there are the strongest moral grounds on which to challenge the decision, amounting almost to a question of good faith.Not only did the three principal naval Powers ratify more than two months ago, but so long ago as 20th June the First Lord announced in a debate on the Wash-ingtou Treaties Bill that His Majesty&apos;s Government were actually carrying out the naval provisions without awaiting the ratifications of the other signatories.Nineteen out of the 20 ships scheduled in the treaty have been scrapped, or -are in process of being scrapped, in pursuance of the policy thus publicly announced, the Lion alone remaining capable of restoration to fighting condition if the treaty were abandoned. Concurrently, the naval personnel has been correspondingly reduced.The above action was taken in the confident belief that the United States and Japan would do likewise. The decision of the United States Government has, therefore, not merely come as a shock to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but is a menace to British interests against which we must enter the strongest protest. We may not only be placed in a position of inferiority in capital ships, which is directly contrary to the whole spirit and basis of the Washington treaty, but an atmosphere of grievance and mistrust will be created which will destroy all the moral effects of the conference and inaugurate a new era of suspicion and naval competilion.You should make strong and urgent representations to the United States Government in the above sense.To this Sir Auckland. Geddes replied as follows on 16th October : I have seen the Secretary of State, and have spoken to him as instructed. He was surprised at and somewhat disturbed by the strenuous language employed. His attitude is most friendly, and so far as he is personally concerned there can be no question of good faith ; but neither he nor the President can order ships (other than obsolete ships) to be destroyed except in accordance with, the terms of the treaty in other words, not until the treaty is ratified formally by the five Powers.If that position is to be changed, a new treaty^ or treaties will have to be negotiated and ratified, and Mr. Hughes is of opinion that the moment for such negotiation has not arrived.The American mind is deeply suspicious of Japan, and the United States Govern-ment fear, according to Mr. Hughes, is that ,if they were to proceed to scrap without a definite formally binding agreement with Japan, they would suddenly find that Japan retained her naval power while they did not.It is only fair to add that Mr. Hughes pointed out with equal vigour that the provision of personnel and supplies for the United States fleet have been made on the basis of the treaty fleet. I find Mr. Hughes unwilling at present to bring influence to bear on France to hasten her ratification. I have urged him to do what he can, and he tells me that he thinks he may be able to find an opportunity in speeches, which he is to deliver at the end of this month, to say something which will be helpful.Opinion on Near East Affairs. On 11th. October Sir Auckland Geddes reported that opinion in responsible American circles had been most favourably impressed by what it regarded as strong and tactful handling of the Near Eastern situation, by His Majesty&apos;s Government. France, on the contrary, was regarded as having behaved&apos; very badly and anti-French feeling was becoming very strong.The prestige attaching to the Prime Ministers name, especially in. the large eastern cities, was higher than it had ever been. When the political situation at home permitted it a visit by Mr. Lloyd George to this country should in his (Sir Auckland&apos;s) opinion be arranged for because of-the results which might confidently be expected. *
