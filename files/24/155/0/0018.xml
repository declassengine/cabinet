FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ALBANIA.New Cabinet. Telegraphing [Nos. 58 and 59] from Durazzo on 8th December, Mr. Heathcote-Smith reported that the Pandeli Envangeli Ministry had resigned, and that a new Cabinet-had been formed. The change of Cabinet, he said, was somewhat in the nature of a coup cVetat effected by the regency council under Akif.The latter summoned the former Premier to resign on the ground that his Cabinet was incomplete; the Premier, demurred,, but shortly afterwards consented as the regency appeared to contemplate force. The new Premier was at once installed with a, complete Cabinet. The Premier, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of War are natives of. the Uskub vilayet; and the Cabinet is Serbophobe and distinctly Italophil. The threatened crisis was brought about mainly through personal rivalry; the new Cabinet, -however, is expected to tackle actively the questions of the constituent assembly and the form of government to be adopted. It is composed as follows-1:1 assan Bey Prishitina    -        -.       - .     ..-  Premier and Xad interim)Foreign Affairs.&apos; &apos;- Interior.- Finance.- War.- Justice.- Education..- Public Works.On 11th December Mr. Heathcote-Smith further reported [No,-62] that protests from every part of Albania, refusing to recognize the new Cabinet in view of the illegal manner of its constitution, had resulted, in. its resignation to-day. A Christian-, merchant of Durazzo, I. Costuris, was to act as Premier, with permanent officials in charge of their own respective ministries, until parliament, which is. spontaneously re.rassembling, should:choose the; new;;Premier.ARGENTINE.Disturbances. On 29th November Mr. Mac!eay telegraphed [No. 180] as follows from Buenos Aires : . I have again requested the competent Argentine authorities to take all measures, to restore order and safeguard British life and property and (group omitted) Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of reports received from the British consular agent at trio Gallegos. The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has renewed his assurances and promised to communicate the consular agent&apos;s reports immediately to the Minister of the Interior with a request for a report on the present situation in the Santa Cruz territory. He was also requested to enquire into the circumstances of Mr. Herbert Robins&apos; death.. I learn from my United States colleague that the Armour plant has been retaken undamaged by the Government troops and the manager, Mr. Sidney J. Macbey, released, as well as other hostages imprisoned by the insurgents at El Paso by arrangement between the troops and the strikers. Several casualties occurred in the original struggle with the insurgents, including probably Mr. Robins.Mr. Ginnell [F.C.R., lii, p. 2].-On 12th December Mr. Macleay telegraphed [No. 186] as follows :-Mr. Ginnell is absent from Buenos Aires and has so far made*no public state-ment, but his representative here has declared that the telegram of congratulation to the Prime Minister, despatched by a group of prominent Irish Argentines, does not represent unanimous Irish opinion in this country.The indications are that the extreme party here will side with de Valera against the agreement, and this will probably lead to a split in the Irish Argentine community. The solution has been acclaimed in the Argentine press, which considers it a triumph of English statesmanship.Luigi Gurasxuta, Kocho Tassi. Zia Dibra : Koiiya Kadri . Cristo Dako Kakki Defwik
AUSTRIA.Venice Conference [F.C.R., lv, p. 2].-Telegraphing [Nos. 279- and 280j&apos;from. Vienna on 1st December, Mr. Keeling reported that a motion which was approved by the foreign affairs committee on 29th November and adopted by the national council on 28th November had the effect of ratifying the Venice protocol under certain conditions; The following was a summary of the motion :  . .   .The national council, taking cognizance of the promise of the conference of: ambassadors that (1) the plebiscite area would be cleared of all Hungarian forces, completely pacified, and occupied by allied troops prior to the plebiscite ; and (2) that an impartial plebiscite would be assured, expected that (1) pacification would not be declared prior to the complete evacuation of the area by all Hungarian formations and occupation by allied troops ; and (2) that participation in the plebiscite under safe-conduct would be made possible for refugees from&apos; Burgenland now in old Austria.     ..&apos;   . &apos;&quot; .......... &quot; i &apos;.   &quot;       i   &apos; &apos; -The Austrian Government had informed him that by refugees was only meant persons who had left the comitats during the recent troubles.   There was no question1 of the return of persons of Bolshevik tendencies who had left the territory after the fall of Bolshevism.   The Austrian Government, had no intention of departing from&apos;; the regulations for the plebiscite laid down by the generals. &apos;The Plebiscite. On 9th December Mr. Keeling telegraphed [No. 282] as follows : I have received an urgent note from the Chancellor in which he states that the position at Oedenberg is such as to exclude all chance of an impartial plebiscite. In support of this statement he adduces the following facts: The presence in&apos; the; plebiscite area of Hungarian authorities, who continue to function in spite, of the factf that all executive power has been formally invested in the commission of generals.^ The presence of numerous individuals who were formerly members of bands and who, together with the officials above, carry on a violent propaganda in favour of Hungary. Intimidation of persons, of Austrian sympathies. Election lists prepared in an arbitrary manner and based largely on false information. The opening of official Austrian correspondence by Hungarian authorities;The note proceeds to state that the generals have been informed of these facts, but appear powerless to remedy them, and that in these circumstances the Austrian Government are unable to-take part in a plebiscite the result of which they cannot recognize to be of any value. The public opinion of the Austrian national council would not admit of any other attitude. With the help afforded, however, by the allied troops this deplorable situation may be remedied, provided a sufficient interval is allowed to elapse between the arrival of the troops and the date of the plebiscite. Mr. Schober, therefore, addresses an urgent appeal to this effect and requests that the conference of ambassadors be asked to instruct the generals to fix the date in accordance with the above view of the situation.From information I have.received from other sources, it would seem that the plebiscite will be a ;farce unless a suitable interval is allowed to elapse after the arrival of the troops.[See Hungary.] . iBALTIC STATES.Meeting of Foreign Ministers. On 9th December Mr. Wilton reported [No. 54] from Riga as follows:  :: .    &apos; &apos;:A meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Finland, Esthonia, Lettlaiid and Lithuania has been arranged for 16th December at Reval. It will be given out.that the subject of. discussion will be an economic conference with Russia.The Prime Minister told me this morning that three other questions will also be discussed : First, the non-fulfilment of the treaties by Russia; second, the- Karelian question ; third, the Vilna question.    ;The Finnish Government has also requested the intervention of the Esthonian, Lettish and Polish representatives at Moscow as regards the Karelian affair.The Prime Minister was guarded in his language, but gave me the impression that in the event of Bolshevik aggression against Finland both Esthonia and Lettland would stand by her. He did not think it possible for the League of Nations to give a favourable response to FinlancPs appeal. Nevertheless Lettland and Esthonia had given their support to the appeal.
As regards the Vilna question, he expressed no hopes of agreement. Tie stated that he had been advised to accept M. Hymaus&apos; scheme amended in accordance With Lithuanian wishes, and was inclined to adhere to this advice.The Lithuanian Foreign. Minister. On 10th December Mr. Dilley telegraphed [No. b4] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had resigned that day, his resignation, taking effect from 13th December. The Vice-minister would probably act as Minister for Foreign Affairs until a fresh appointment was made.The. official reason for the resignation was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had authorized the visits of Mr. Rosen baum to. Warsaw on his own authority, and had failed to inform the Cabinet, at subsequent meetings, of his action.In regard to this Mr. Wilton telegraphed [No. 55] from Riga as follows : -The lithuania anian Minister visited me yesterday, and indicated his opinion, that the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was due to a disagreement with theMinister of War over.the.Vilna question, and. with the Minister of Agriculture on theagrarian reform question.He stated that in view of political difficulties the selection of his successorwould be delayed, and it would probably be impossible for him to proceed to theReval conference.FINLAND.The Soviet Government and the Karelian Tiising. On 5th December Mr. Itennie reported [No. 183],from.Helsingfors, that the Finnish Government had, that afternoon, received, a-note addressed to the Finnish legation at Moscow, of which the following was a summary : The Soviet Government protest against the appeal made to the League of Nations regarding the Karelian rising, as the League consists of a group of nations hostile to Russia, notably France and Japan. The appeal is considered as a hostile act violating the treaty of peace. The Russian Government possesses proof that the Finnish Government had long prepared the movement, and were only waiting for a favourable mompiit to act; this is shown by the fact that the attacks took place solely in communes touching the Finnish frontier. The Finnish Government is said on 22nd November to have.given Savinkotf permission to enter Finland, and has also permitted acts of aggression by the corps of counter-revolutionaries which participated in the Kronstadt rising. The Soviet Government insists on the Finnish Government taking the following steps : (1) The immediate and effective closing of the frontier.(2) The cessation of all support of organizations or individuals preparing acts of aggression against russia. (3). The dissolution of all organizations and bureaux on Finnish territory whichdirectly or indirectly participate in the organization of incursions. (4) The dissolution of all organizations formed by Russian counter-revolutionaries - and the expulsion of those who directed them.Unless these measures are executed the Russian Government will (? take) other steps to ensure observation by the Finnish Government of the treaty concluded with Soviet Russia.On 11th December Mr. Rennie telegraphed [No. 185] the following summary of the reply of the Finnish Government to the above Soviet note and others: The Finnish Government maintain that it is their right as well as their duty to address themselves to the League of Nations regarding events occurring on their frontier which threaten to provoke various difficulties. If impartial enquiry proves that the Soviet Government has fulfilled her promises to the population of eastern Karelia, this result can only be to their advantage. The Finnish Government, in general terms, categorically deny that they are responsible for the rising in Karelia, adding that, although the Soviet Government state that. they have confirmatory docu-mentary evidence, the latter have produced nothing to justify their accusations.. As to the. demand that certain measures should be taken with a view to putting an end to the rising, the Finnish Government renew their declaration of absolute neutrality, and state that directly the news reached them they issued orders to prevent any violation of the peace treaty, and forbade all recruiting, organization of bands, and transport of materiel on Finnish territory.   They cannot refuse the right of asylum to
political refugees, but armed refugees will be disarmed. They cannot.consider as justified the demand that private persons are to be prevented from sending humanitarian assistance, food, medicines, &amp;c, to the civilian population of Karelia, especially in view of the fact that the Soviet Government is already receiving such help from other foreign countries, including Finland. As regards those demands of the Soviet Government which imply an interference in Finnish sovereign rights, the Government will maintain full liberty of action. The note concludes by stating that the best moans of restoring order in Karelia is for the Soviet Government to execute the provisions of the treaty of Dorpat and its annexed declaration.Telegraphing [No. 188] again on the same day, Mr. Rennie further reported that, -in order to stop fighting in Karelia, the Finnish Government had formally offered its good offices to the Soviet Government, suggesting a recommendation to the Karelians that, if the Russian attacks ceased, they should make terms on the basis of the Dorpat treaty.   His informant was the Minister for Foreign Affairs.Bequest for a Loan to Karelia.-Oi\ 11th. December Mr. Rennie reported [No. 186] that the Finnish Government had refused, in reply to an enquiry from White Russian officers, to make a secret loan to the Karelians, and in reply to further enquiry had stated that their policy was based on the principles of strict neutrality and observance of the Dorpat treaty.   Mi-, Rennie went on to say : The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the Finnish minister in London has been asked by several British officers who served in the Murmansk expedition to be given visas to enable them to pass through Finland in order to volunteer with the Karelian forces. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has instructed the Finnish Minister to grant visas to such applicants only when they are recommended by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Visas have been, also refused to several. German and Swedish officers who have tried to volunteer.There lias been no special news from Karelia these last two days. The Bolsheviks are apparently concentrating forces, otherwise operations are. at a standstill.   Here there is little enthusiasm noticeable in favour of the movement.The Aland Islands. Mr. Rennie telegraphed [No. 184] on 10th December that the day before the Diet had finally&apos; approved three laws giving effect to the Aland Islands convention, and granting an amnesty to the Aland Islands separatists.A law was also passed providing for the bringing into force of the autonomy law at a date to be fixed by the President of the republic.GREECE.The Turko-Greelt Question. On 9th December Mr. Bentinck telegraphed [No. 602] as follows from Athens : In view.of press reports of the forthcoming conference on the Turko-Greek question, I venture to draw attention to the fate of Greeks, Armenians, and Turks friendly to Greeks inhabiting the territory now occupied by the Greeks if abandoned to the Turks as in Cilicia. The French Minister recently spoke about this. He considered that the safety of the population would be secured by the formation of a competent international gendarmerie in place of the Greek army, but it appears to me that it would be dangerous to remove the army before the gendarmerie are ready to take their place, and then the removal could only be done gradually.In my opinion, and in the opinion of those who know the Greeks, the surrender of part of Thrace would be a bitterer pill to swallow even than that of Smyrna.In the event of a settlement including the recognition of King Constantine, it will be essential to obtain ample and real guarantees for the protection of the Venizelists in Greece.GUATEMALA.Revolution. -Mr. Gaisford reported [No. 25] from Guatemala on 6th December that a revolution had broken out at midnight on 5th December, and that the President of the republic had been forced by prominent generals to sign his resignation. As the army in the.capital was entirely on the side of the revolutionary party there had been very little fighting. The Ministers of the Government were under arrest. The movement was led by Liberals who were in power under the last administration. 35-2 b
Telegraphing [No. 26] again on the following day, Mr. Gaisford further reported that the military coup aVeiat had been so far successful. Power was in the hands of three generals Orellana, Lima and Larrave and order was being maintained. Guarantees of tire lives and property of foreigners and of the life of the President of the republic, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others had been given by General Orellana.Telegraphing [No. 27] on 9th December Mr. Gaisford still further reported that at a &quot;meeting specially convoked of the assembly of 192u (that of 1921 being alleged illegal by the Liberals), General Orellana had been nominated provisional President of the republic. In order to avoid the necessity of calling for elections within a week, he might declare a state of siege. Good order was still maintained and general conditions were normal.On .11th December Mr. Gaisford again telegraphed [No. 29] saying that the United States Minister had asked for a warship to be sent. Popular feeling was reacting against the usurping general. The capital was calm, but there was ground for apprehension elsewhere and there might be danger for foreigners.HUNGARY.New Cabinet.-Mr. Holder reported [Nos. 462 and 463] from Budapest on 5th December, that Count Bethlen had formed a Ministry which, with the exception of the portfolios of home affairs, agriculture and finance, was identical with the preceding Cabinet. The portfolio of hoine affairs was held by Count Klebelsberg, that of agriculture by M. Mayer, and that of finance by M. Kallay. The Government had revived the Ministry of Pood, which was held by M. Terffy.The Plebiscite. The following telegram [No. 466] was sent by Mi-. Hohler on 8th December:  The generals telephoned yesterday to the conference of Ambassadors&apos; represen-. tatives stating that they considered that the allied contingent, which is expected to arrive at Sopron this evening, insufficient to execute the plebiscite, and that in any event voting arrangements could not be completed before 18th December.The Hungarian Government have addressed a note to us requesting that the plebiscite may be taken within the time limit stipulated by the Venice agreement.In view of the fact that the conference of Ambassadors have now definitely decided against the despatch of additional forces, and that the dangers of the present situation can only be aggravated by further delay, we are telegraphing to the generals urging them to fix the actual date of the plebiscite at the earliest possible moment, and adding that in our opinion voting should take place by 13th December at the latest.On the same day Mr. Hohler also telegraphed [No. 467] as follows : The Hungarian Government have been formally notified of the decision of the conference of Ambassadors regarding the closing of the frontier, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has intimated to my Italian colleague the readiness of his Government to execute this measure without delay.We have also informed the generals of this decision, which should facilitate their task in fixing the actual date of the plebiscite.[See &quot;Austria.&quot;]   .PARAGUAY.The Revolution [F.C.R., lvi, p. 7.J. Telegraphing [No. 181] from Buenos Aires on 29th November Mr. Macleay reported as follows : I have received a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new Paraguayan administration informing me of the election by Congress of Dr. Eusebio Ayala as provisional. President of the republic, and of his own appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs.An official reply would appear to be tantamount to recognition of the new Government. The Foreign Affairs representatives at Asuncion consider the provisional Government legally elected, and that it might be regarded as a continuation of the old one.This is the attitude of the Argentine Government, who will not send their Minister at Asuncion fresh credentials.Am I authorized to recognize the new Government ?
PERSIA.Relations with Russia [F.C.R.,. LVII, p., 6].-Referring to his telegram [No. 659], Mr. Bridgeman, telegraphing [No. 660] on 29th November, reported the com-nm ideation to him by the Prime Minister of the Persian Governments replies to the Russian notes. Regarding the Russo-Persiau agreement, the excuses for the delay in. ratification were that for two months the Medjliss had been occupied with other matters-; that for the next six weeks the position of the Government had been too uncertain to permit consideration ; and that on a vote of confidence being registered, the treaty had been submitted to the Medjliss for the customary examination by a. commission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This examination&apos; had revealed discrepancies between the Russian and Persian texts, and. to avoid anything which might adversely affect Russo-Persian relations, the Government had . been authorized to discuss privately with the Russian Minister, who had undertaken to refer to Moscow. Owing to the apparent misinterpretation of the discussions as pro--crastination, the instructions to the commission would be that their report should be presented to the Medjliss forthwith.Regarding the concession of the North Persian oil wells, the reply had been that the invalidity of the Khostaria concession, wdiich had been notified to the British, legation, placed it outside the Russo-Persian agreement, and the Government were therefore unable to accept the Russian point of view.Financial Difficulties [F.C.R., LVII, p. 6],  On 30th November Mr. Bridgeman sent [No. 664] the following telegram : The chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia has received a letter from the Prime Minister to the following effect: &quot;I do not think you are unaware of grave situation created in the capital and provinces by the non-payment of funds to the military for the last few months. I must request you most emphatically to provide the Government with 1,000,000 tomans in order to prevent the undesirable circumstances that may arise from withholding funds from the military.&quot;The chief manager anticipates that this threat will be followed by a demand from the Minister of War for cash to be delivered to him if the advance be not willingly granted by the bank.This was followed by a telegram [No. 667], dated 2nd December, saying that the Imperial Bank of Persia had advanced 100,000 tomans to the Persian Government. Mr. Bridgeman added that he had no previous knowledge of the transaction.In acknowledgment of Mr. BridgemaiPs telegram [No. 658] of 27th November, the Secretary of State sent [No. 468] the following on 5th December: -Colonel Grey&apos;s reply to the Persian Prime Minister that the present moment did not seem opportune for appealing for British assistance was quite correct. He might in fact have based his reply not only on the Persian Governments action regarding the Khostaria concession, but upon their wdiole policy ever since they came into power.It is astonishing that the Prime. Minister should pretend to hope for British financial assistance while he is actively carrying on a definitely anti-British policy and seeking to introduce foreign influence with.the avowed object of supplanting us in Persia.Our evidence on these points is conclusive. We are fully aware of the activities of the Persian Minister in Washington, where, acting on the instructions of his Government, he has sought to enlist, as it is alleged with success, the services of Mr. Lansing in the. Persian interest, has actually engaged Mr. Sinister, and is in treaty with other American officials, who are to proceed to Persia to act as financial adviser and directors of the former Russian Bank, the intention being to turn it into a State Bank and thus supplant the Imperial Bank of Persia, which is already in fact the State Bank.At the same time we know that the Persian Government are seeking to obtain a . large loan from America, and, to facilitate this, have offered to hypothecate to American financiers the royalties derived from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In addition they have actually offered to America concessions already owned by British subjects, e.g., the Persian Minister is prepared to grant to an American syndicate a railway from Mohammerah to the Caspian, Sea, in entire disregard of the prior rights of the Persian Railway Syndicate. A. further instance is that of the Khostaria 35-2 C
concession, the rights of which had previously been acquired in proper form by a British firm..The Persian Government have also dismissed the British officers from the South Persia Rifles, and in complete disregard of past experience and of the hostility displayed to this country by some of the previously engaged Swedish officers during the war, have decided to introduce Swedish officers in their place. .Not long ago the Persian Government concluded agreements with the Soviet Government and with the Government of Afghanistan, and have even sent an emissary to conclude an agreement with the Kemalist Turks, all inspired by a policy inimical to British interests. Lastly the Persian Government have thought fit to carry on a series of overt acts of unfriendliness to His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect&apos;of our telegraph, postal and other interests in the country.The Persian Government are of course at liberty to turn for help to any country or syndicate they please. But they cannot in reason expect that the British Govern-riient, after being ostentatiously and consistently flouted by successive Persian Ministries, should come forward with material assistance to a Government known to be engaged in undermining British interests wherever possible; and to have only applied to us in order to tide over the necessities immediately confronting them, after which there is no security that they will not continue or resume their anti-British activities.Your telegram No. 6(14 has now been received (vide supra).You should make it quite clear to Plis Highness that such a threat as that reported therein can carry no weight with His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would know what action to take were the present military dictator to act in a high-handed and illegal manner towards the Imperial Bank of Persia. .The Imperial Bank of Persia have received from their manager a telegram in the sense of your telegram No. 664, and are desirous of taking some action. I am strongly adverse from&apos;approving any financial advance by His Majesty&apos;s Government for reasons above stated, and would only consent to the Bank&apos;s or the Oil Company&apos;s making advance if they did so on their own responsibility, and if the Persian Government were previously to give in writing the following guarantees : (1) Hussein Khan&apos;s activities in America shall be abandoned.(2) The Persian Governments royalties from the Anglo-Persian Oil Companyshall not be offered as securities for loans from third parties. (3) Existing valid British concessions shall receive full recognition. (4) Railway.concessions already under discussion with the British syndicate, shallnot be-offered elsewhere. ... , ...-British Financial Claims- On 1.0th December Mr. Bridgeman was instructed by telegram [No. 473] from the Foreign Office to address a note to the Persian Govern-&apos; merit stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto abstained from approaching them regarding numerous advances made during the last 10 years in order to afford time for the study of Persian resources by the British financial adviser. In the&apos; present circumstances, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that steps should now be taken for the payment, or the better regulation of these advances, which &apos; by the accretion of unpaid interest are gradually attaining undesirable proportions. Floating advances will amount on 6th March next to 1,217,333L 11s. and krans 124,626,714.75 cents respectively, against which the only payment now being made is 2,858L 6s. 8d. monthly in respect of interest on items 3 to 6 in Maclean&apos;s list. In view of the present financial difficulties of the Persian Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not suggest the immediate liquidation of these debts, but they consider that an adequate provision for interest and sinking fund should now be made.Oil Concessions in North Persia.-[F.C.R., LVII, p. 6]. On 7th December Mr. Bridgeman sent [No. 675] the following telegram: In reply to my note protesting against the Standard Oil Company concessions, the Minister for Foreign Affairs declares in a note dated 30th November that the Persian Government had repeatedly pointed out that Khostaria had no valid concession, the documents which he obtained having been &quot; issued contrary to legal prescriptions,&quot; and not approved by the Medjliss. The Persian Government, therefore, could not regard as serious (1 group undecypherable) (? objections to) the grant to the American company of rights incontestably the property of the Persian Government.
RUMANIA.Resignation of the Gabinet-Siv Herbert Bering telegraphed [No. 254] frohx : Bucharest as follows on 12th December ; ;M. Take Jonescu resigned yesterday. For some, time past he had not been sympathetic with the Prime Ministefs policy of retaining office because he has a parliamentary majority in spite of the manifest desire of the Crown for a change of government, nor has he approved of the premier&apos;s policy of reconciliation with the peasant party, whose programme he regards as dangerous. Of his two supporters in the Cabinet, the Minister of Justice has also resigned and the Minister of Finance will shortly follow suit.I anticipate a coalition of the remainder of the Cabinet with possibly Transylvanian and conservative elements. If the Premier is successful, liberal prospects in future will be considerably less favourable.Telegraphing [No. 259] again on the following day Sir Herbert reported that the Prime Minister had also resigned, and that M. Take Jonescu had been requested by the King to form a new government. He had asked for three days for the purpose, and-was reported to have received guarantees of no opposition from the liberal party. -RUSSIA.Protest from M. Chicherln.-^Tb.e following telegram was sent from Moscow by . M. Chicherin on 9th December: Apres sa protestation exprimee dans les notes circulaires du clix-neuf juillet et du deux novembre contre la, convocation sans la participation de la Russie d&apos;une conference avant trait des questions interessant directement le peuple russe, le gouvernement russe se voit oblige d&apos;emettre en outre une protestation speciale contre 1&apos;examen par la conference de Washington de la question du chemin de fer est chinois qui ne regarde que la Russie et la Chine. Le gouvernement russe s&apos;etant declare pret a remettre le chemin de fer en question au pouvoir cles autorites chinoises sous condition de 1&apos;adoption par la Chine cle certaines garanties indispensables cette transmission n&apos;a point, encore eu lieu, et les droits de la Russie aur ce chemin cle fer restent intacts. Au moment on un accord sera survenu entre la delegation russe chargee de cette tache et le gouvernement chinois sur cette question 1&apos;alteration cles droits de la Russie qui sera stipulee par cet accord entrera en vigueur mais jusqu&apos;alors ils sont et demeurent les memes qu&apos;auparavent. Le gouvernement russe se voit done oblige de protester contre toute decision qui serait prise par la conference cle Washington au detriment cles droits de la Russie et declare que il ne reconnaitra aucune infraction aux droits du peuple travailleur russe qui serait adoptee a 1&apos;insu du gouvernement representant sa volonte et conservera sa liberte d&apos;action pleine et entiere pour faire valoir ces droits et toute reclamation eu decoulant au moment et par les moyeus que il jugera opportuns et propices.SERBIA.Resignation of the Government. On 4th December Sir Alban Young reported [No. 283] from Belgrade that, apparently on account of (&apos;? unacceptable (? demands) (? principally) in connexion with the distribution of offices made by the (? democratic) wing of the coalition Government, M. Pasitch and his Government had resigned, and that the King had accepted his resignation. After consulting the president of the national assembly, the King subsequently sent for M. Pasitch, but no statement. had been made as to the result of the interview.TURKEY.Message from Youssouf Kemal.-On 1st December Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed [No. 766] the following summary of the reply, dated Angora, 17th November, from Youssouf Kemal to a joint telegram of the allied High Commissioners of 21st October : After thanking us for our intervention with the Greek Government with regard to the excesses of the Greek troops, he protests against a comparison between the
Greek massacres and devastation and the legal and impartial sentences on Turkish . subjects in the Samsoun region, who plotted the dismemberment of Turkey and worked for years to detach the Black Sea littoral and the adjoining region as a separate Greek State, Pontus, arming and equipping bands and organizing secret tribunals and recruiting offices.He claims that the court-martial punished the guilty and prevented a more extensive rising, the real object of which would have been to draw the Turkish forces from the western front.He protests against the accusation of inhumanity contained in our telegram,, declares that the Angora Government have not failed to punish all officials who exceeded instructions or failed in their duty in the repression of revolt.He insists on the atrocities of the Greek troops during the evacuation, which have-left 100,000 inhabitants homeless and destitute, adding that the Turkish public, well knowing that the Entente powers provoked the Greek invasion, wonders at the calmness they show in face oh the Greek crimes. He concludes by saying that it is indispensable to treat Christians and moslems alike, and that the calmness shown by the great Powers is all- the more inexplicable seeing that the Greeks by their devastations make it impossible for Turkey, after peace is concluded, to pay the interest and sinking fund on her share of the Ottoman debt, and for the Angora national assembly to contemplate the linking of the question of debt with that of the reconstitution of the devastated region.
