FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ALBANIA. -The Situation  [F.C.R., lix, p. 2].-On 28th December Mr. Heathcote-Smith telegraphed [No. 67] from Durazzo as follows :-1. Both Hassan Bey and the present Premier make it clear by their (? group omitted) that the retention of power is considered ultimately to belong rightly to that official party which can command superior armed forces. Each boasts its own superiority in this connexion. Hassan Bey is openly for the first party, Ahmed Bey the veiled leader of the other.2. The presence of the League of Nations commission was largely the deciding-factor in the resolve of Hassan to accept the situation for the present without fighting. It appears that discontent is growing at the arbitrary decision regarding the Drin elections.3. The remaining two members of the regency resigned as a protest against the removal of their colleagues by parliament.4. Mgr. Fan Mol later on withdrew his acceptance of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Premier considers that he wished to remain free in order to wait for the establishment of the independence of the Albanian Orthodox Church.CHILE.Tacna Arica. The following telegrams [Nos. 133 and. 135 of 1921 and 1 of 1922] were sent from Santiago by Mr. Vaughan on 29th December, 30th December and 1st January respectively : (1) The third Peruvian reply refuses the restriction, of the arbitration to Article 3, and demands the fulfilment of the arbitration as to all differences arising from the treaty of 1883.Chile is invited to make a simultaneous request to the President of the United States to act as arbitrator, and his decision is to be final.(2) The Chilean reply to the third Peruvian note laments Peru&apos;s demand for full arbitration. of all questions, which Chile cannot (? accept). The only course, therefore, seems to be to put an end to this telegraphic exchange of notes, and Peru must bear the consequences of her present attitude.(3) Peru has sent an acrimonious reply to the fourth Chilian note, maintaining that Peru alone has respected the treaty, and suggesting that the question of Chile&apos;s violations of it and the manner of rectifying them shall be submitted to.arbitration.On 28th January Mr. Grant Duff sent the following telegram [No. 184] from Lima: The Peruvian Government reject direct negotiations at Washington to reach an agreement respecting difficulties in regard to the plebiscite, and refuse to submit to arbitration differences which cannot be.solved by. direct discussion, which has hitherto never led to a satisfactory result. They repeat the proposal that as soon as Chile has defined a declaration in favour of complete arbitration, Peru shall send a representative to Washington to meet the Chilean delegate in order that differences between the two Governments may be conjointly submitted to the discussion [sic] of the arbitrator.Peru also proposes that simultaneous telegrams shall be sent by the Peruvian Government aud by the Chilean Government to the United States Secretary of State requesting that negotiations may take place at Washington, and that the President of the United States will accept the duties of arbitrator in order to determine-definitely all differences between the two countries arising out of the treaty of 1883.CHINA.Boycott of Messrs. Butterfield and Swire. Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed [No. 6] as follows on 5th January : The boycott of Messrs. Butterfield and Swire commenced at Amoy on 7th November, contrary to the real wishes of the Chinese merchants, who admitted that
they were helpless in the face erf the students&apos; declared intention of terrorizing any Chinese working for the firm.On 19th November the Chinese foreman was attacked, and had one ear cut off as a warning at a time when both the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and the Taoyin were absent from Amoy, leaving no responsible Chinese official in charge. Scurrilous pamphlets in English (? group omitted) His Majesty ?s Consul by name were circulated broadcast by the local society formed to promote agitation, whose representatives in Peking are in. close touch with Wai-Ohaio-Pu.On.10th December ills Majesty&apos;s Consul was refused lighterage for his -private--effects from the consulate to ButterfiehVs warehouse, and the Chinese, who eventually hired him a lighter, was tarred and beaten by the students.On .1.6th December lighters were not allowed to coal H.M.S. Hollyhock until the permission of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce had been obtained.On 21st December, both the Chinese officials being again absent from Amoy, two of Butterfield&apos;s Chinese employees were arrested, and no explanation has yet been obtained from the Chinese officials.The agitation has naturally received immense encouragement, from the local official attitude as revealed by the above acts, aud has thus been enabled to spread as far as Hankow, Bangkok and Manila. Here,-my own offer to concede non-essential points and my repeated personal appeals to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Chinese Government should at least, publicly express disapproval of the agitation and deal with the perpetrators of outrages against innocent parties, have met with a reception which can only be described as unfriendly.No British subject :iu the employment of Messrs.. -Butter-field and Swire is involved.: s-   .:    FINLAND.   .Relations with the Bolsheviks [F.C.R., lix, p. 4].-On 30th December Mr. Rennie reported [Noi-204] from flelsingfors that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had fold him confidentially that he: had that day received a message from the Bolshevikrepresenta-tive suggesting negotiations with him with a view to reaching an amicable solution, as the Russian&apos;Government did not-intend to push the matter further.Telegraphing [Nos. 7 and S] again on 7th January, he said :  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has had a conversation this week with the Bolshevik representative.   The latter asked that the Finnish Government  (1) should in principle promise to expel the White Russians, who would be enumerated in a list which he would present;(2) should return all arms taken from refugees crossing the Finnish frontier ;(3) should pay the expenses of the expedition against the Karelians. .      The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he could not discuss (2) or ($)&apos;.As regards.(1), he said that he would receive and examine a list and take a decision on the, merits of each case. Pie told me that there were certain undesirables whom the Finnish Government would be glad to remove, and that a list presented,by the Bolsheviks might accordingly be useful.Mr. Rennie added that the Minister thought it unlikely that such a list would,be presented.-[See &quot;Russia &quot;and &quot;Italy.&quot;]GERMANY.Commissions of Control. On 9th January Lord d&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No. 8]: that the following was reported to be the position regarding the different commissions of control:- Naval (Jommission.-Jias reduced personnel 50 per cent., and.should complete destruction by April.   Factories will take rather longer.Military Commission. Has reduced personnel by 33 per cent. Should,finish, destruction in from three to six months.Air Commission. Has completed its task and is merely waiting a decision regarding &quot; constant supervision &quot;, and its installation. -The delay in closing up by the military and naval commissions is to some extent caused by Germany, as minor obstructions and minor discoveries of arms constantly occur and are not visited with adecpiate punishment.
GREECE.Financial Agreement. The foUowing telegram [No. 2] was sent to Mr. Bentinck from the Foreign Office on .3rd January : A financial agreement has been signed with M. Gonnaris, ,of which the following are the chief points : (I) Although the advances to Greece under the 1918 agreement have not been repaid, His Majesty&apos;s Government consent to the assignment of the security by Greece to a loan to be raised in. Great Britain up to 15,000,0001.(2) No part of the proceeds is to be used for repaying advances made by theUnited States of America. (3) As much as possible of the proceeds is to be expended in Great Britain on british goods.(4) The Greek Government waive all claim to further advances out of the 10,000,0001. credit provided for in the 1918 agreement and to any advances out of the 2,000,OOOL credit of the 1919 agreement.(5) As regards the debt for supplies and services rendered prior-to 1st July 1919, the Greek Government will furnish an acknowledgment of indebtedness for a round sum of 9,000,000Z. This figure will be adjusted as soon as the exact total is ascertained ; His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve the right to ask for Greek Treasury bills, to the amount of such total later.(6) His Majesty&apos;s Government will renew for a further 12 mouths the Greek Treasury bills for 2,100,000L, which fell due on 20th October 192.1.The above agreement does not constitute a raising of the financial blockade of Greece, nor does it imply that His Majesty&apos;s Government are themselves prepared to give the Greek Government financial assistance. His Majesty&apos;s Government merely waive the lieu on Greek security which they held under the 1918 agreement. This will undoubtedly facilitate the Greek endeavour to obtain a loan on the London market, but will by no means ensure their being able to do so.You should make the above quite clear if questioned on the subject.HUNGARY.Relations with Auslria.-Oi\ 29th December Mr. Hohler reported [No. 486] that he had spoken that day to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs being ill, and that the latter had informed him that the Hungarian Government had already addressed a conciliatory note to the Austrian Government, even explaining that if they had known that the latter had given pledges to the conference that the delay would not extend beyond 18th December, and had a request for delay till that day reached them in time, they would gladly have assented to it.The Under Secretary of State had responded very gladly to his recommendation of a further move in the direction of friendly relations with Austria. He said that the Prime Minister was anxious to have a meeting with Herr Schober, but that the Austrian Minister had expressed the opinion that this would be premature. Perhaps His Majesty&apos;,s Minister at Vienna could forward this idea if it met with Lord Curzohs approval. There were, of course,.many matters on which it was highly important to come to an arrangement.ITALY.Appeal from Finland. On 1st January Sir Ronald Graham reported [No. 1] that the Finnish Minister in Rome had appealed to the Italian Government for moral support in the differences between his Government and that of Soviet Russia, and that the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs had given a non-committal reply. He did not consider that a reference to the League of Nations would (group undecypher-able) very practical result, and he could only suggest that the limitrophe States to Russia, such as Poland, should exercise a moral pressure in Moscow through their representatives there.[See &quot; Finland &quot; and &quot; Russia.&quot;]
The Banco di Roma.-8\i- Ronald Graham,gent the following telegram [No. 8] on 9th January :  -The British Consul, Rome, informs me that the position of. the Banco di Roma is reported this morning to be much improved, and is now considered sufficiently satisfactory. Other banks which had suspended business with the Banco di Roma are said to be prepared to resume. The decision will probably be taken to-day for the fusion of the Banco di Roma with the mew bank which tire parliamentary catholic party have for some time been proposing to institute. A. large capital will be provided and the directors will be persons of high standing and capacity. Agrarian interests will be strongly represented. The counsellor of the French Embassy states that the. French Government, who have large deposits (? formerly) derived from the French loan for lira payments, including over 15 million lire in the Banco -di Seonto, have,, in order to avoid a crisis, not attempted to withdraw any of these sums. They have, however, requested the Italian Government to give such deposits priority of repayment.JAPAN.Foreign Relations. On 7th,January Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 5] that he had been officially informed that the Japanese Government recognized that a good understanding with America was essential, and, while they regretted the termination of the alliance with, ourselves, they were on the whole so far satisfied with the results of the Washington Conference. The Minister for Foreign Affairs thought that his Government would be. able to come to an agreement with Great Britain and the United States on the question of submarines. He was, of the same opinion in regard to Mr. Roofs resolutions about China, though these might require some alteration. The integrity of Russia would also be accepted by Japan ; but the question of Saghalin must, in the opinion of his Government, be settled by direct negotiation with Russia.PERSIA.Position of the Government [F.C.R., lix, p. 6]. -Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 714] on 26th December that all Government schools were closed for lack of funds. The disaffected sections in the gendarmerie, the police and the cossacks, were demanding arrears of pay from, the Minister of War, and threatened dis-turbances in the town failing his compliance. The Minister of War had been sharply rebuked by the Shah for the assumption of dictatorial powers and interference in civil administration.Telegraphing [No. 720] on 29th December, Sir Percy reported that the Prime Minister had sent him a message enquiring whether the banks&apos; lien, on customs could be extended for another six or eight months, so as to raise some 700,000 tomans. He had informed the emissary that if the proposal was communicated in writing he would transmit it, and had expressed his personal opinion that it would not create a good impression on His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had already formulated conditions on which they would facilitate an advance.On 1st January 1922 Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 1] as follows : The Shall sent for mo yesterday afternoon. His Majesty&apos;s object was to induce me to authorize on my own responsibility a small advance by the Imperial Bank of Persia for the payment of the discontented soldiery, which he said would ease the tense situation here, but would not weaken our means of pressure on the Persian Govern-ment. He painted a most gloomy picture of the situation, and threatened its total collapse, the resignation of the Government, and the inability to find a new one, &amp;c. Although the situation is unquestionably precarious, I said I could do no such thing, and I refused to be moved by His illajesty&apos;s arguments and pessimism during nearly two hours. I told His Majesty that his Government had been acquainted with the conditions on which you were prepared to authorize an advance, and begged him to exhort his Prime Minister to come to terms on these, and not himself to confuse the issue by fresh proposals. I could not of course decline to represent His Majesty&apos;s views to you, but I could hold out no hope of their producing any satisfactory result.I think that the interview may have had a good effect. The Prime Minister saw His Majesty immediately afterwards, and came to see me early this morning. His Highness was much more tractable, and I hope to be able to telegraph within 24 hours 36-2 B
to- you a form of written assurances on the four points, which I think and trust will he acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The. Prime Minister has now gone to secure the approval of the Medjliss in so acting. I have received valuable assistance from Colonel Grey in these protracted conversations with His Highness.The Shah&apos;s idea was, no doubt, to get something on account for the army for fear of its holding him to ransom when he wants to leave for Europe. Somewhat to my relief, His Majesty made no allusion whatever to his projected journey.On 3rd January Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 1] his approval of Sir Percy&apos;s action and language on both the occasions reported above.Referring to his telegram of 1st January, Sir Percy Loraiue reported [No. 2] that the Prime Minister had been unable to obtain the assent of the Medjliss to the assurances on the four points on which he and the Prime Minister had agreed, although the latter was entirely satisfied with Sir Percy&apos;s attitude. It appeared that the chief difficulty rested with the third condition, which requires the recognition of the validity of existing British concessions.In Colonel Grey&apos;s opinion, unless the Medjliss became more amenable, the. Prime Minister was likely to request the Shah to dissolve it. .Sir Percy&apos;s private information was to the effect that the matter had not been submitted at all in open Medjliss, but had been discussed secretly in the Foreign Affairs Commission, where presumably Nosret-ed-Dowleh had created the opposition.On 5th January Sir Percy Loraine sent [No. 10] the following telegram: This afternoon the Medjliss passed a resolution authorizing an advance loan of one million dollars from the United States, secured, on the southern oil royalties payable by December 1922.   Interest 7 per cent.   The source of the funds is not stated.POLAND.Vilna. Mr. Max Muller reported [No. 1] from Warsaw on 1st January that he had handed an aide memoire to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, warning the Polish Government against accepting the annexation of Vilna in spite of pressure from the Vilua and Warsaw diets which would be brought to bear on them, and that His Excellency had replied that the Polish Government were determined to refuse the demand and he added that though taking exception to some of the expressions in my aide memoire, its general sense would strengthen his hands in resisting the pressure.Russian Reconstruction. On 8th January Mr. Max Midler telegraphed [No. 8] that, according to a communique in the press, the French Minister had informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if an (? international) scheme for the economic reconstruction of Russia materialized the French Government would insist on the participation of Poland.PORTUGAL.The Prime Minister. On 4th January Sir Lancelot Carnegie reported [No. 3] that the Prime Minister, having come to an arrangement with the political parties under which the elections were postponed to the end of the month, had withdrawn his.resignation, and his ministry remained unaltered. The troops near Lisbon were returning to their permanent stations.RUSSIA.The European Conference. On 9th January Sir Eyre Crowe telegraphed [No. 1] to Lord Curzon at Cannes the following translation of a message received by M. Krassin from M. Chicherin for the Prime Minister and communicated by the Prime.Ministers private secretary: The Russian Government accept with satisfaction the invitation to the European conference convoked for next March. The Central Executive Committee will meet in extraordinary session to proceed to the selection of the Russian delegation and confer upon it the widest powers. Even should M. Lenin, the President of the Council of the People&apos;s Commissaries, be prevented from leaving Russia by his multifarious
-duties, more particularly in connexion with the famine, the composition of the delegation and the scope of its powers will in any case be such as to invest it with the same authority as if citizen Lenin formed part of it. Nothing therefore that depends on Russia will in any case impede the rapid progress of the conference.Relations with Finland [F.C.R., lix, p. 9]. On 29th December a telegram ;[No. 127] was sent to Mr. Hodgson in regard to the relations of the Soviet Government with Finland. .It was pointed out that the Soviet Government appeared to be presenting demands with which the Finnish Government might find it impossible to comply, and. at the same time Russian troops were being concentrated either on or near the Finnish frontier. The peace might, therefore, at any time be broken, and His Majesty&apos;s Government felt it a matter of urgency to take any step that might be possible to avert such a disaster.-The Finnish Government had appealed to the League of Nations for an enquiry, and the Soviet Government might be asked by the League to state its case ; should this be done the latter Government would be well advised to accept the invitation. If he saw no objection, Mr. Hodgson was instructed to see M. Chicherin with a view to dissuading him from doing anything which woidd be likely to bring the dispute to a head before everything had been done to arrive at a peaceful settlement,The Foreign Office was satisfied that the behaviour of the Finnish Government had been correct and that it had done its best to prevent the perpetration of unneutral acts from Finnish territory.[See &quot; Finland &quot; and &quot; Italy.&quot;)SERBIA.New Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 6th January Sir Alban Young reported [No. 5] that Dr. Momcilo Nincic had been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pasi having declined to continue the combination of that office with the presidency of the council.SI AM.Loan.- Telegraphing [No. 05] from Bangkok on. 29th December Mr. Crosby reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him officially that the King of Siam had issued a royal decree, dated 24th December, authorizing the Siamese Miuister in London to conclude the necessary arrangements for floating a loan of 2,000,OOOZ. sterling on the general credit of the King of Siam, and to sign agreements, bonds and other, necessary documents relating thereto. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had added that the arrangements for the flotation would be effected through the Hong-Kong and Shanghai Bank in London.TURKEY.Signor Vuozzi on the Situation in Anatolia. On 6th January Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 13] an appreciation of the situation in Anatolia which had been given, him by Signor Tuozzi.The nationalists, according to Signor Tuozzi, hate England, and the successes they have had over the Greek army have been considered as so many successes over England. The Malta deportees on their return to Anatolia indulged in violent propaganda against England, and proclaimed that she was a weak power in reality. The report reached Angora while Signor Tuozzi was there, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had come to an agreement with the Egyptian Government. This was considered a further proof of weakness on the part of England. Angora had carefully followed the developments of the Irish situation.In regard to the general political situation, he said that there was much discontent in Anatolia, as was shown by the appearance of armed bands, whose suppression taxed the resources of the Angora Government. The appearance of these armed bands was becoming more and more frequent, and Signor Tuozzi thought that just as the Kemalist movement had its origin in the formation of bands, so it might collapse through the agency of bands. Gendarmes had to scour the country for deserters or persons unwilling to serve in the army.
Relations with the Bolsheviks were characterized by mutual suspicion, and the nationalists realized that the situation of the Soviet Government was not nearly as. strong as it was. Tine nationalists were receiving a diminishing quantity of arms and munitions of war from the Bolsheviks. These arms, &amp;c, were delivered at Black Sea ports, and Signor Tuozzi considered that they should be intercepted.The representatives of other eastern States, such as Afghanistan, were busy intriguing at Angora, and the nationalists indulged in the illusion that there was serious trouble in India. They attached undue importance to the propaganda they were attempting to carry out in India through Afghanistan.Mnstapha KemaPs position, he said, was stronger than ever. As president of the National Assembly and commander-in-chief of the nationalist forces, his power, was that of a dictator: The present resolve of the Angora Government is to establish the future capital of Turkey either at Angora or at some other spot in Anatolia. The Sultan would be left, at Constantinople. By fixing the seat of the National Assembly in Anatolia, Mustapha Kemal counted on escaping from (he pressure which could be applied to a Turkish Government established at Constantinople. A Turkish Govern-ment having its seat in Anatolia would also be at greater liberty to intrigue with or against the surrounding States. Mustapha Kemal, who was now inspired as much by personal ambition as by patriotism, also felt that he would no longer be the same personage if Constantinople were maintained as the capital of Turkey. The man next in importance to Mustapha Kemal was his personal friend Fethi Bey, Minister of the Interior, and one of the Malta deportees.   Refet Pasha did not count for much.The partisans of Enver did. not constitute a danger to Mustapha Kemal in the present circumstances though matters might be different if Mustapha Kemal suffered a set-back.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Holland in the Pacific. The following telegram [No. 222] was sent by Air. Balfour on 4th January : The United States of America concluded ou (? 24th December) 1921 with the British Empire, France and Japan, a treaty with a view to the preservation of general peace and the maintenance of their rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean. They agreed thereby as between themselves to respect their rights in relation to these possessions and dominions. The Netherlands not being a signatory to the said treaty and the Nether-lands possessions in the region of the Pacific Ocean, therefore, not being included in the agreement referred to, the Government of the United States of America, anxious to forestall any conclusion contrary to the spirit of the treaty, desire to declare that it is firmly resolved to respect the rights of the Netherlands in relation to their insular possessions in the region of the Pacific Ocean.THE VATICAN.Appreciation of His Majesty the King. On 29th December Count de Salis reported [No. 49] that on his presenting the customary congratulations for the coming year, the Pope, after anxiously enquiring about, the delay on the part of the Irish in ratifying the agreement, had expressed the highest appreciation of all that the King had done in the cause of peace, and had spoken with great cordiality of his good wishes for the health and prosperity of their Majesties.
