FOREIGN COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.WalVs Attitude. In a message from Kabul dated 18th July, but not received until 27th July, Colonel Humphrys reported that he had been told by the Persian Minister that a party of Indian muhajirin, who did not want to go back to India and had been refused permission to remain in Afghanistan, had applied to him to be allowed to go to Persia. The Minister had recommended by telegram to his -Government that they should be allowed to do so. Colonel Humphrys added that, the Wali had undertaken to rid Afghanistan of seditionary elements from India, and to use his utmost endeavours to keep them away from the tribes.ALBANIA.    &apos;Recognition by the United States. Mr. Chilton reported from Washington on. 28th July that on the previous day the United States Government had announced the grant of cle jure recognition to the republic of Albania.AUSTRIA.An Appeal. On 4th August Mr. Akers Douglas informed. Lord Balfour that the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs had come to him that day and had made an appeal on behalf of the Government for early consideration at tbe forthcoming meeting of Premiers of the precarious situation of Austria. A memorandum showing the serious state of affairs and the needs of this country would be presented on Monday by the Austrian Minister in London. Mr. Akers Douglas added that without help in the shape of a loan guaranteed by foreign Governments he feared that tbe state administration might soon collapse.BALTIC STATES.Recognition by the United States. Mr. Chilton has reported from Washington that on 27th July the United States Government had announced the grant of de jure recognition to the republics of Esthonia, Livonia and Lithuania.CHINA.Financial Situation [F.C.R., lxxiv, p.&apos;3). The following reply to Lord Balfour&apos;s enquiries was sent on 28th July : The Anglo-Japanese group of banks&apos; representatives recognized that a 2\ per cent, surtax could not be pledged in advance and had proposed to secure funding operation, firstly, on the customs revenues so far available ; secondly, on the wine and tobacco tax; thirdly, on the salt revenues.After consulting Mr. Hillier and my consortium colleagues, I submit the following replies to the questions :-(1) The floating debt is held to include all overdue payments in respect of the Chinese Government loans, advances, domestic or foreign, and unpaid claims of foreign firms, societies, or individuals, which have been admitted by the Chinese Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had admitted that it amounts to over $400,000,000, and, including debts for railway, telegraph and telephone material, it is probably nearer $500,000,000.(2) It is held that the financial situation is so desperate that without assistance no Government will be found to carry on and no debt consolidation scheme is possible. Undoubtedly, any advances for administrative purposes to a bankrupt Government are unsafe, but it is not proposed they should be made without a strict measure of control.(3) The. Chinese Government have already agreed verbally to the supervision of expenditure by the board of audit with foreign advisers. Monthly advances would be placed to the credit of an account in the name of the Minister of Finance with the group banks and used solely for the payment of the current expenses of the Peking-Government. Cheques could only be drawn if accompanied by a statement of the board of audit countersigned by two of its foreign advisers giving details, of the disbursement and the name of the officer to whom payment is to be made.
The Chinese Government must undertake not to borrow money from other sources during the continuance of the advances which may be continued if negotiations, for a funding bond issue do not proceed satisfactorily.  .....&apos;;&apos;-(-1) The Chinese Government would be required to satisfy its pledge of disband-in ent by summoning a conference of provincial representatives to decide on the necessary measures, and if would be difficult for Chang Tso-lin to refuse to participate in such conference. Disbandment is admittedly a most difficult point and it can only come as a result of the slow pressure of public opinion in China.(5) Neither the present Cabinet nor any other Cabinet approved by the Parliament which is to meet on 1st August can have any stability without financial support. Given such support there is a chance of some sort of control being re-established over the majority of provinces.       .(6) The disappearance of the present Government, and probably of Parliament, would be followed by the progressive diminution of control,over the country by succeeding Governments ; but if Parliament (? goes) or merely obstructs, some form of military dictatorship it&apos;is not improbable.Intelligence Report. The following was sent by.Mr. Olive on 3rd August: -No progress has been made towards reaching unification. Sun Yat Sen is still on a gunboat off Canton and has the support of the radical labour extremists. Chen-Chiung-Min is unwilling to take resolute action although his troops control Canton. Wu Pei-fu remains at Loyang and. has entirely failed to keep the Peking Government together, which has disintegrated from lack of funds. With the exception of the Minister of Communications, who is. the special nominee of Wu Pei-fu, and the Minister of Justice, all Ministers have resigned or declined to take up their posts. The opening of Parliament on 1st August was marked by wrangling and disturbances and no business was done.Chang-tso-lin continues to strengthen his position in Manchuria where he is supported by the ex-Premier Liang-Shih-Yi and the ex-Minister of Communications. He has seized the salt revenues as well as railway earnings in defiance of the Peking Government and foreign protests. He is still nominally an outlaw and has failed to -come to terms with the Peking Government, but as a result of the rapprochement with Tsao-Kun it is generally thought that hostilities against Wu Pei-fu will recommence next spring or even this autumn. Fighting has recommenced in Szechuen, and Kiangsi is in a state of turmoil owing to the presence of rival bodies of southern, northern and native troops. The general outlook is bad and the Chinese .are pessimistic as to the future.Mandate for New Cabinet. ReuteFs Peking agent reported on Gth August that .a mandate had been issued appointing the following Cabinet: -Tang Shao-yi    - -        -        -        - Prime Minister.Dr. Wellington Ivoo      -        -        -        - Foreign Affairs.Tien Wen-lieh   ----- Interior.Kao Ling-wei     - -        - - Finance.General Chang Shao-tseng       -        -        - War.Admiral. Li. Ting-hsin    -        -        -        - Navy.Chang Yao-eheng - - - Justice.Dr. Wang Chung-hui     - . - -. Education.Lu Sin   - - - - - Commerce.Kao Eng-hung   ----- Communications.Dr. Wang Chung-hui would, he said, act as Prime Minister pending Tang Shao-yi&apos;s assumption of the premiership. These appointments required the approval of Parliament, and it was still doubtful whether Tang-Shao-yi would accept office.GERMANY.The Situation.-Lord d&apos;Abernon informed the Foreign Office that on 29th July the Chancellor had sent him an urgent message to see him and continued : -I found him gravely perturbed at M. Poincare&apos;s reply of 26th July to the German request that the monthly payments of 2,000,0001 for clearing house payments should be reduced to 500.000Z. The Chancellor said that the language of this note was not only most unusual but totally contrary to the policy of reconstruction and pacification. It appeared to be a deliberate attempt to force Germany into a &quot;voluntary default.&quot; It destroyed the last hope of financial recovery by means of a moratorium and a loan.
The tone of the note was that of a European dictator. It was, moreover, quite illogical in that on one page M. Poincare declared the. German demand mill and void and on the next he said that &quot; since you have made the demand 1 have determined on a certain number of measures of sanction which will come into force automatically unless I receive within ten days a promise from the German office to continue payments at the old rate.&quot;The Chancellor informed me that he intended on Monday to reply to the French Government not on the details but on the disastrous effect of their communication.Tie desired me to inform His Majesty&apos;? Government that a catastrophe was imminent. So far, he had not published the full text in the German papers as he feared the exact words would excite public feeling and accentuate a crisis. It was,, however, generally known that the German request had been roughly declined; the result had been that the mark had fallen from 2,400 to 2,750 to the pound.I promised the Chancellor that I would telegraph his communication. The German Embassy in London will communicate a textual-copy of the French note.GREECE.Tlie Situation. On 27th July Mr. Bentinck reported from Athens that it was stated in the press that M. Gounaris had informed a number of journalists on the Government side that &quot; the results of the decisions and activities of the Government in national questions would exceed the most sanguine national expectations.&quot;Other Ministers had told the journalists that&quot; if they would have a little patience they would see very satisfactory things.&quot;   ,The Minister for Foreign Affairs had called and handed him a note addressed to-Lord Balfour, which was also being addressed to the other allied Governments.The note sketched the recent course of negotiations and stated that the Greek Government was not responsible for the prolongation of the conflict.Massacres and deportations were threatening with extermination the entire-Christian population of the regions under Kemalist occupation. In face of this situation Greece was obliged to consider the best measures for putting an end to the conflict.Greece, the note added, would always be ready to examine every peace proposal in common with the allied Governments.On 29th July he further reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had just handed him and his colleagues a further long note which stated that the Greek. Government had come to the conclusion.that only the occupation of Constantinople would bring about the conclusion of peace, and that they requested the Allies to give-the necessary orders to the occupying troops.He had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was still without instructions. The Minister had repeated that orders to advance had not yet been issued.In reply to this on 29th July Lord Balfour informed Mr. Bentinck that so far-he had not received the further Greek note, but must express his astonishment that a request for permission to occupy Constantinople should have been put forward by the Greek Government who must, from the repealed declarations of His Majesty&apos;s. Government, be aware that the Allies were quite determined not to consent to such a proposal.Mr. Bentinck then informed Lord Balfour that he had handed a copy of his message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs explaining that it was about the second note and a point blank refusal. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he understood the situation perfectly. He added that the Minister of War had that clay shown him a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief in Thrace assuring him that we need have-mo fears of an advance or any rash acts.On 31st July Mr. Bentinck further reported as follows : My colleagues have at last received their instructions which are to take joint action. We therefore handed in an identic note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening (my note was in English) to the effect that we were instructed to say that the allied Governments must refuse to take the measures requested by the Greek Government in their second note, and that orders had been given to the inter-allied military command to repel by force every military movement directed against the zone occupied by the allied troops. -
Although I had already handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the messages conveyed in your three telegrams, I considered myself justified in associating myself with my colleagues.We added a personal suggestion to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the troops should he withdrawn from the frontier to avoid any incident. The Minister for Foreign Affairs took notes and said he would enquire of the general staff as he still maintained that Greek troops were not on the frontier, at any rate not in contact with the allied forces.The Minister for Foreign Affairs again enquired whether an early decision could be reached on the whole eastern question.On 1st August instructions were sent to Mr. Bentinck to address an urgent note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the following sense : His Majesty&apos;s Government received on 31st July a copy of the Greek note asking for allied consent to a Greek occupation of Constantinople. They are unable to concur in the arguments by which this proposal is supported, and they have in the past signified unequivocally that the proposal itself is unacceptable. To this view they still adhere.It has been the sole aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the direction of their policy in the Near East to bring about peace between the combatants in that region, and they therefore welcomed the action of the Greek Government in accepting the mediation of the Allies. His Majesty&apos;s Government deeply deplore the non-success of their efforts in this direction, but they have not yet abandoned hope that further negotiations may result iu peace ; and they are clearly of opinion that the military occupation of Constantinople by a Greek army would do nothing towards ending the present war, and might be the fruitful parent of new ones.It has further to be observed that the apparent imminence of a conference at Beicos or elsewhere at which discussions would be resumed makes the proposal of the Greek Government, always inadmissible, peculiarly inopportune at the present moment. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore feel it incumbent on them to state once again, in the most unambiguous manner that they are entirely unable to assent to an occupation of any kind by Greece of Constantinople or of the neutral zone, and that any attempt on the part of Greek troops to effect such an occupation would be resisted by force.On 2nd August Mr. Bentinck reported that he had handed an urgent note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs that morning with a telegram from General Harington to the War Office about the Greek reconnaissance of the allied front.The Minister for Foreign Affairs was in the middle of a Cabinet council and said he would read the note and telegram to the other Ministers and have immediate instructions issued to the Greek commander-in-Chief in the sense desired.Later in the same day he further reported as follows : The Minister for Foreign Affairs has just sent mean urgent letter to say that after seeing. General HaringtoiFs telegram, the Minister of War, who had not previously heard of the incident, has telegraphed to the Greek Commander-in-Chief giving the strictest orders : -(1) To take immediate steps to prevent every incident between the troops.(2) To punish severely those responsible for the incident.(.3) To arrange the dispositions of the troops so as to prevent any repetition of such incidents.The Minister of War himself came to me in haste after the meeting of the Council of Ministers and gave me the same information which he begged me to telegraph urgently to you and to General fiarington. He has promised to show me the result of the enquiry which he had ordered.I warned the Minister of War of the dangers from frontier incidents and drew attention to my personal suggestion made to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about withdrawal from the frontier. The Minister said that the troops were being withdrawn to the villages behind the line.On 3rd August Mr. Bentinck reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had handed him and his colleagues another note that morning in reply to theirs of 31st July. The note stated that the decision of the Powers was an obstacle to decisive action by the Greeks for the conclusion of peace and drew serious attention to the delay which would produce fresh calamities for Christian Asia Minor.43-2 b
On the same day he also further reported in regard to the frontier incident that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had called that morning&apos; and read,out to, him a telegraphic report from tbe Greek Commander-in-ChJef received at midnight:--The report stated that at G.30, 1st August,. 12 Greek soldiers, of whom six were unarmed, went to. look for wood. They crossed the frontier by mistake, fell into au ambush, were fired on aud dispersed leaving three men behind whom they subsequently heard from the French commander had been killed by the Turkish guard.lie had again warned.the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the dangers from frontier incidents and the latter had replied in the sense of the Minister of Wats statement previously reported.In regard to this incident, Sir Horace Rumbold also reported from Constantinople on 3rd August that in order to prevent recurrence of similar incidents the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief was sending General Mombelli, accompanied by British and French officers, to exchange maps with the Greek corps commander, in order to ensure that the frontier was clearly defined and to obtain an undertaking that both sides should be held back to a fixed distance, and that patrols and aircraft should.not cross the line.On 5th August Mr. Bentinck reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had sent his secretary that morning to read to him a telegraphic report form the Greek Comnvander-in-Chief regarding the meeting between General Mom belli and the Greek .General Vlachopoulos. The latter had been instructed to accept the proposal that each side should retreat three kilometres behind the frontier and to take the necessary steps to carry this out.[See tinder &quot; Turkey.&quot;]Western asia minor. On 3rd and 4th August Mi-. Bentinck reported as follows :  A telegram from the Greek Government to the High Commission, Smyrna, dated 27th July, as published in the press, states that western Asia Minor, inhabited by races in which the Greek element predominates, in virtue of civilizing influence and historical rights, can never return to Turkish administration, assuring to all without distinction of race or religion the benefits of up-to-date government, and participation of all in the administration. The&apos; realization of liberty was to be obtained by the utilization of all local forces, and all inhabitants are invited to collaborate. Then follows the proclamation made on 30th July.This proclamation begins by referring to the decisions to be taken for the future in detail and the administration of western Asia Minor. The/High Commissioner is authorized to take suitable measures giving effect to such decisions. Reference is then made to the inevitable obstacles due to the continuation of the .war, and another proclamation is foreshadowed regarding the measures to be taken. The most urgent of these will be introduced first, also of thrfse which are practicable in present circumstances, and which, from an international point of view, will be in harmony with the regime to be (group omitted) in future to a liberated Asia Minor.The work of liberation will not be achieved by decisions of States and treaties but must be continued by a freed people themselves. The populations of Asia Minor must forget the past, expel religious and race fanaticism and replace it by modern conceptions of work, peace and economic progress. Only by moral elevation &apos;of character and internal and external peace will the liberty brought by the Greeks be completed.[See under &apos;: Turkey.&quot;],ITALY.New Cabinet. On 1st August Sir Ronald Graham reported that Signor Facta had re-formed his Cabinet as follows : Signor Facta - - - - -   Premier.Signor Taddei (Giolittian) - - - -   Interior.Signor. Alessio (Giolittian democrat)       - -   Justice.Signor Para tore (Italian democrat) -        -        -   Treasury. ;Signor Soleri (Giolittian democrat) - War. :Signor Luciani (Liberal democrat) - - -   Liberated Territories..Disturbances. On 7th August Sir Ronald Graham reported as follows: -In consequence of further disturbances the Government have temporarily entrusted the military authorities with full administrative powers in the provinces of Genoa, Milan, iVncona, Parma and Leghorn. The situation improved yesterday except at Genoa. The Director of Public. Security has resigned and has been replaced by Signor Gasparri, prefect of Aquila, who is said to be able and energetic..
The Minister oE the Interior, in reporting yesterday to the Council of Ministers, -said that 44.provinces of Italy were absolutely peaceful; in 16 there was a state -of. unrest; in the remainder the agitation was almost entirely expended.   Koine remains cjuiet.&apos;   -JAPAN.    &apos; .Siberia [F.O.R., lxxiii, p. 5]. On 28th July Sir Charles Eliot reported froui &apos; Tokyo the following summary of statements made by the official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in charge of Siberian affairs : The Japanese Government after informal conversations in Tokyo have officially notified Chita of their readiness to resume negotiations on the lines of the Dairen conference and are*awaiting a reply. They are anxious to conclude an arrangement -quickly so as to secure the interests of their nationals in Siberia before the withdrawal of the troops is complete.The agreement if concluded would be primarily a trade agreement similar to that of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Sovyet Government-. It would not deal with -the question of the Nicolaieffsk massacre about which the Japanese Government may negotiate subsequently. No special privileges are asked for the Japanese since the Japanese Government desire only the open door in Siberia.Newspaper reports state that, M. Joffe, the Sovyet representative, has left Moscow to take pare in the negotiations, but the Japanese Government know nothing of this officially and would be embarrassed by his participation as they wish to confine the -discussions to questions affecting the territory east of Chita,My informant thought there would probably be fighting at Vladivostock after the -withdrawal of the troops. Men-of-war will be stationed there for a time and will land .marines for the protection of Japanese residents if necessary.On the same day Sir Charles also reported that the American Government had informed the Japanese Government, and he believed others concerned, that they thought the time had come to abolish the technical board of the Siberian railway. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had agreed because after the withdrawal of the Japanese troops the board had no locus-siancii, but he feared the collapse of the railway.Ratification of Treaties. On 7th August Sir Charles Eliot informed the Foreign Office that five treaties with a supplementary treaty to the Pacific treaty and the twelve resolutions had been ratified by Japan, on 5th August. All the Washington -treaties had now been ratified.PERSIA.Troops for Arabisban [F.C.R,, lxxiv,p. 5]. A telegram was sent from the Foreign-Office to Sir Percy Loraine on 27th July, acknowledging his telegrams already reported.   It pointed out the necessity of observing our undertakings towards the. Sheikh, who was apparently inclined to meet the acknowledged claims against him of the Persian Government. Sir Percy was authorized to use his endeavours to persuade the Persian Government from sending troops through the southern part of Arabistan, although there did not seem to be much ground for objection to the despatch of a, detachment of such insignificant dimensions to Shustar. Should occasion arise, Sir Percy would be at liberty to warn the Persian Government that the continuance of a procedure, which they were aware was objectionable to His Majesty&apos;s Government,-would be not unlikely to exert a bad effect on existing relations. Any unjustifiable intrusion on the Sheikhs affairs by the Persian Government might oblige His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider wdiat steps they might be compelled to take to come to his assistance.POLAND.The Cabinet. On 3lst July Mr. Hoare reported from Warsaw that M. Novak, rector of Cracow University, had received a mandate from the Chief of the State to form ,a Government which would receive the support of the majority in the Diet from the left and the centre. The principal members of M. SlivinskPs Government would probably retain office.PORTUGAL.State of Siege in Lisbon. On 8th August Mr. Grant Watson reported that a state of siege had been declared in Lisbon where the workmen remained oh strike. In the rest of the country conditions were normal. The Cabinet had met the night before in the Lisbon barracks. Work on the river had been paralysed .since 4th August, though two ships were able to leave on 5th August.
RUSSIA.Hostile Attitude of Greece [F.C.R.. Ixxiv, p. 6]. On 28tli July the following; reply was seat to M. Karakhan&apos;s message of 19th July : The British Government have received with surprise your telegram of 19th July-protesting against the action of the Greek fleet in the Black Sea.The fact that the allied Governments at Genoa invited the Russian Soviet Government to co-operate with them for the purpose of establishing peace in tile-Near East pre-supposed a state of war which in fact exists between Gireece and Angora, and of which belligerent naval operations such as blockade measures, and the destruction of the enemy&apos;s stocks of munitions, even if these munitions have been supplied by a Power which, as the protest states, is profoundly penetrated by the spirit of peace, are perfectly legitimate incidents. The Greeks have not, so far as the British Government are aware, violated any of the recognized rules of war in. their naval action in the Black Sea, and are clearly entitled to carry on their operations so long as a state of war exists.In regard to the passage of Greek ships of war through the Straits, the pre-war-arrangements in regard to the neutrality of the latter were terminated by the passage of the Goeben and Breslau through the Dardanelles in .1914 and by the gratuitous-entry of Turkey into the war against the Allies; and, pending new international arrangements, the Straits are open to warships of all nations except in so far as this may be incompatible with the armistice with Turkey of October 1918. The-Greeks are, therefore, perfectly entitled to pass freely through the Straits into the-Black Sea.In conclusion, I may observe that your present telegram gives no indication that the Soviet Government whilst protesting against the failure of the Allies to prevent hostilities carried on by Greece, has. on its part, made any effort to hinder the Angora Government from continuing warlike operations.TURKEY.Proposed Communication to Angora and Greek Governments.  On 27th July-Mr. Henderson reported that he was submitting to his colleagues the following draft communication to the Angora and Greek Governments: The Governments of the French Republic, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States of America have been ^deeply moved by the accounts of the sufferings to which certain elements amongst the population of Asia Minor are alleged to have been exposed. They have consequently considered it indispensable, in the interests of humanity and justice, that an impartial enquiry should be instituted as soon as-possible; in order to verify on the spot the truth of the allegations of ill-treatment inflicted on these populations, be they inussulman or Christian. With this object in view the International Red Cross has been invited to constitute two commissions, composed of neutral delegates, which will be charged with the prosecution of this enquiry in eastern Anatolia, and more especially in the Black Sea coastal regions, as, well as in the territory in the occupation of the Greek forces.The High Commissioners undersigned trust that the Government of Angora,  the Greek Government] will notify at the earliest possible moment its concurrence in this humaritarian proposal, and will undertake to facilitate in every way the task of the commission.Western Asia Minor.-&apos;-On 3rd August Sir Horace Rumbold reported that the-Turkish Government had addressed to the Allied High Commissioners a formal protest against the Greek proclamation of.autonomy of the occupied territories in Asia Minor.   [See above, under &quot; Greece.&quot;]The note declared the proclamation, which prejudiced the cause of peace, to be invalid in fact and in law, and held Greece responsible for its eventual consequences.URUGUAY.   &apos;Commercial Treaties. Sir Claude Mallet reported from Montevideo on 28th July that it, would be untimely to negotiate a commercial treaty now, and he had ascertained privately that the Uruguayan Government would not entertain any commercial treaty with, a favoured nation clause with any European Power until after the Pan-American congress.
