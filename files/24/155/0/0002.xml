FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN. .Mission to Berlin. Through the Viceroy of India [581 S.] information was received on 27th April that the Afghan envoy had reported to Kabul the receipt of a telegram from General Mohamed Wali Khan announcing the safe arrival of his party in Berlin, where they had been accorded great honour and respect by the German. Government.GERMANY.Appeal to America. On 21st April Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 253] that, the State Department had that night made public the following communications which had passed between the Government of Germany and the -Government of the United States ;-(1) Berlin, 20th April 1921. In the name of the German Government and people, the undersigned, notwithstanding the still existing technical state of war, respectfully petition the President of the United States of America to mediate on the reparation question, and to fix the sum to be paid by Germany to the allied Powers, and to eagerly urge him to secure the consent of the allied Powers to such mediation. They solemnly declare that the GFerman Government are ready and willing to agree without qualification or reservation to pay to the allied Powers as reparation such a sum as the President, after examination and investigation, may find just and right. They formally pledge themselves to fulfil in the letter and the spirit all provisions of any award that may be made by him. With abiding faith in the righteousness of this request and with undeniable sincerity of purpose, the German people, through their constituted Government, submit their appeal to the President of the United States with the confident hoioe that it may be granted to the end that a final award may be made in accordance with right and justice to meet the heartfelt wishes of all civilized nations, to avoid the immeasurable consequences of the. imminent coercive measures, and to promote the peace of the world.   Signed: Fehrenbach, Simoss.(2) The following reply of the Secretary of State was sent on 21st April: This Government could not agree to mediate on the question of reparations with a view to acting as umpire in its settlement. Impressed, however, with the seriousness of the issues involved as they affect the whole world, the Government of the United States feels itself to be deeply concerned with the question of obtaining an early and just solution. This Government strongly desires that there should be an immediate resumption of negotiations, and reiterates its earnest hope that the German Government will promptly formulate such proposals as would present a proper basis for discussion. Should the German Government take this course this Government will consider the bringing of the matter to the attention of the allied Governments in a manner acceptable to them in order that negotiations may speedily be resumed.On 25th April Sir Auckland telegraphed [No. 262] the following German reparation proposals, received at the State Department that afternoon : The United States Government have by their note of 22nd April opened the possibility, in a way which is thankfully acknowledged, of solving the reparation problem once more by negotiations ere a solution is made possible (? impossible) by -coercive measures. The German Government appreciates this step in its full importance. They have in the following proposals endeavoured to offer that which according to their convictions represents the utmost limit which Germany&apos;s economic &apos;(? group omitted) even under the most favourable developments can bear : (1) Germany expresses her readiness to acknowledge for reparation purposes a total liability of 50 billion gold marks (present value).Germany is also prepared to.pay the equivalent to this sum in annuities adapted to her economic capacity, to a total of 200 billion gold marks.
Germany proposes to mobilize her liability in the following way :-&apos; &apos; (2) Germany to raise at once an international loan, of which the amount, the rate .of interest, and the amortization quota are to be agreed on. Germany will participate in this loan; and its. terms, in order to secure the greatest possible success, will -contain special concessions and generally be made as favourable as possible. The proceeds of this loan to be placed at the disposal of the Allies.(3) On the amount of her liability not covered by the international loan, Germany is prepared to pay interest and an amortization quota in accordance with her economic ^capacity. At the present juncture she considers the rate of 4 per cent, the highest possible.(4) Germany is prepared to let the Powers concerned have the benefit of improvements in her economic and financial situation. For this purpose the ^amortization quota should be made variable. In case an improvement should take place, the quota would rise, whilst it would correspondingly fall if the development /should be in the other direction. For the regulation of this variance an index scheme would have to be prepared.(5.) To accelerate the redemption of the balance Germany is ready to assist with all her resources at the reconstruction, of devastated territories. She considers reconstruction the most pressing part of the reparation, because it is the most effective way to combat the hatred and misery created by the war. She is prepared to undertake herself, the rebuilding of townships, villages and hamlets, or to assist in the reeoust.ruetion with labour, material and her other resources in any -way the Allies may.desire. The cost of such labour and material she would pay herself (full details about this matter have been communicated to the reparation commission). -(6) Apart from reconstruction work, Germany is prepared to supply for the same purpose, to the State concerned, any other materials and to render any other services -as far as possible on a purely commercial basis.(7) To prove the sincerity of her intention to make reparation at once and in an unmistakeable way, Germany is prepared to place immediately at the disposal of the. reparation commission the amount of one billion gold marks in the following manner: Firstly, 150,000,000 gold marks in gold, silver, and foreign bills ; Secondly, 850,000,000 gold marks in treasury bills to be redeemed within a period, not exceeding three months by foreign bills and other foreign values.(8) Germany is further prepared, if the United States and the Allies should so desire, to assume part of the indebtedness of the Allies to the United States as far :as her economic capacity will allow her.(9) In respect of the way the German expenditures for reparation purposes should be credited against her total liability, Germany proposes that prices and values should be fixed by a commission of experts.(10) Germany is prepared to secure subscribers of the loan in every possible way by assigning to them public properties or public income in a way to be arranged, for.(11) By acceptance of these proposals all other German liabilities on reparation --account are cancelled aud German private property abroad released.(12) Germany considers that her proposals can only be realized if the system of sanctions is done away with at once ; the present basis of German production is not further diminished ; and the German nation is again admitted to the world&apos;s --commerce and freed of all unproductive expenditure.These proposals shall testify to the German firm will to make good the damage ^caused by the war up to the limit of her economic capacity. The amounts offered, as well as the mode of payment, depend on this capacity. As far as differences of opinion as to this capacity exist, the German Government recommend to have them -examined by a commission of recognized experts agreeable to all parties concerned (group undecipherable) (? which they) hereby declare to accept, as should the United States Government consider that the negotiations could be facilitated by giving the proposals another form, the German Government would be thankful if their attention, were drawn to the points in which the United States Government consider an alteration -desirable. The German Government would also readily receive any other proposals the United States Government might feel, inclined to make.The German Government is too firmly convinced that the peace and welfare of the world depends on a prompt, just and fair solution of the reparation problem hot to do everything in their power to put the United States in a position which enables
them to bring the matter to the attention of. the allied Governments.   Berlin, 24tk April 1921.The reply to this was telegraphed [No. 186] from Berlin by Lord fcilmarnock on. -3rd May :  .  , ,,The Government of the United States of America has received the memorandum left by Dr. Simons with the Commissioner of the- United States of America under date of 24th April relating to reparations. In reply, this Government states that it finds , itself unable to reach the conclusion that the proposals afford a basis for, discussion acceptable to the allied Governments. This Government, therefore, again expressing its earnest desire for a prompt settlement of, this vital question, strongly urges the-German Government at once to make directly to the allied Governments clear,, definite and adequate proposals, which would in. all respects meet its just obligations.Reparations Discussion in the Reichstag.  On 29th April Lord .D&apos;Abernon tele-graphed [No. 176] as follows :  .-. .   &apos; &apos; ;;.Yesterday in the Reichstag Herr Stresemaiin, whilst criticizing the form in which the latest negotiations respecting reparations were carried on, expressed a limited-approval of the policy of the Government. He recommended that efforts should be made-to bring together the leaders of the great world economic concerns and laid stress on the necessity for a Franco-German understanding. The new German offer was only a stage on the way to the solution of the whole problem, which could not be-solved on the basis of national, economics, but only by a system whereby the results of the production of the whole world coti-ld be brought into a national [sic] caisse, out of the..proceeds of which the countries which have suffered most should first receive-satisfaction.Dr. Simons further defended himself from the attacks which had been made on him and expressed himself pessimistically at the probability of reaching an under-standing with France at the present stage. He had not, however, given up all hope. With regard to disarmament, he said that Germany was required to disarm whilst her neighbours maintained enormous armies. Something had to be done in. view of the excitement caused in the eastern provinces by.the Polish concentration on the frontier, The Minister then sketched the recent progress which had been made towards a peaceful understanding with Poland and referred to German relations with Russia and the necessity of finding an outlet in that direction for German productions.Count Bernstorff expressed regret at the party tone of the debate, and said that Germany could only withstand the heavy pressure to which she was subjected if the-nation was completely united. He considered that the political situation had improved slightly, and declared that America regarded Europe from an economic and not from-a political point of view. She had no interest in seeing Germany torn to pieces, and: it had been repeatedly proclaimed that the Mnuroe doctrine was a strictly political principle. The new sanctions were equivalent to the renewal of a state of war. Germany was ready to go to the limits of her capacity. But in making this sacrifice-and in suffering a fresh state of war, they wished at least to feel that they had not left any possible means untried. If the German people faced their fate in this spirit they would be justified in hoping that outside Germany recognition would dawn of the-fact that the economic and political problems of the world could not be solved by force, but only by just negotiations based on sincere goodwill.Telegraphing [No. 178] on 29th April Lord Kilmarnock said that the speeches of Herr Stresemann and Count Bernstorff were of considerable importance in view of the reports that a change of Cabinet was impending, and that the, former would be-Chancellor and the latter Foreign Minister.Rumoured Changes in the Ministry. On 30th April Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 182] that the following official communique had been published: It is true that the Minister for Foreign Affairs tendered his resignation some days ago to the President. The reason for this step was the impression received by the Minister as to the attitude of German public opinion towards his policy. In view of the negotiations initiated by him with the United States, the Minister-declared himself ready to carry on the affairs of his office provisionally. - The-President has refused his request, because not only has the Cabinet unanimously approved the continuation&apos;of the negotiations with America, but the debate in the-Reichstag has also proved that the representatives of tl people in their great majority wish for such continuation.
Upper Silesia.Polish Insurrection-Colonel Percival telegrapher! [No. 78] from - Oppeln oa 3rd May as follows : A. Polish insurrection broke out last night simultaneously on the eastern border of the industrial area and in Pless and Rybnik. The greater part of the Beuthen, rural Pless and Rybnik districts are now in the hands of the rebels.In the Pless and Rybnik districts the Italian troops have been attacked in their barracks and a number of officers and men lulled and wounded. Polish agents have also blown up the railway bridges which connect Upper Silesia with Germany. The Polish section of the Upper Siiesian police has in many places gone over to the rebels: after disarming the German section.Amongst the insurgents there are men in Polish uniforms, and six lorries with arms and ammunition crossed the frontier from Poland in the Beuthen district. It is clear that we have to do with a concerted Polish plan to seize Upper Silesia by force.&apos; I have no evidence that the Polish Government has any connexion with the movement, but I should be grateful if it could be reminded of its promise to close the frontier. (G roup und ecypherable.)Captain Simson, a police officer at Zaborze, has been taken prisoner by the Polish insurgents.   [Since released, telegram No. 80, 3rd May.]Telegraphing again [No. 79] on the same day, Colonel Percival further reported that Tarnowitz town had been cleared of the Polish bands;, that heavy fighting between the French troops and the insurgents was reported from Xattowitz town ;; that at Antonienhutte 200 insurgents had surrendered to our forces; that in other parts of the industrial area the situation was uncertain; and that it appeared that the insurrectionary movement was specially active in the territory to the south of the-line Tarnowitz-Cosel.GREECE.The National Bdnk.-r-L6x6. Granville sent the.folio wing telegram [No. 18-1] from, Athens on 20th April :-The Greek Government submitted to the Chamber yesterday evening a convention concluded with the National Bank extending the bank&apos;s privilege of issuing notes to &quot;countries recently annexed, to Greece,&apos;&apos;&apos; prolonging that privilege for 20 years, borrowing 550,000,000 drachmae from the bank, and allowing it to &quot; increase pro-visionally by 500,000,000 the value of notes in circulation on the bank&apos;8 own account.&quot;Ibis morning the president of the International Financial Commission received^ an urgent note, dated 16th April, from the Minister of Finance, transmitting a&apos;copy of the convention, explaining that this action is necessitated by the continuation of the war as it has been impossible to*raise a foreign loan owing to the present situation of the financial markets in Europe and America, and begging for the consent of the Commission. The note adds that the Government are convinced that owing to the economic vigour of Greece they will be able before long to raise a loan abroad which will have the sole (? effect) of withdrawing the notes in circulation in excess of the allowed maximum, which excess it argues is not exaggerated in comparison with the fiduciary circulation per head of the population in &quot; other great states.&quot;- The delegates are unanimous that the Commission should refuse, but the president (the Italian delegate) will of course take no action till instructions have been received from the three Governments.Relations with Turkey. On 1st May Lord Granville reported [No. 209] that he-had received a note from the Greek Government and went on to say: The note points out that the declaration by the Powers places the Greek Government in an embarrassing situation, for there is a war in which there are neutrals but no belligerents able to exercise belligerent rights. The note explains that, owing to the non-ratification of the treaty of Sevres, a state of war exists between the Allies, including Greece, on the one hand and the Ottoman Government on the other.Pelations amongst the Allies themselves- are governed by the alliance and the terms of the treaty drawn up in common, whereas the terms of the armistice govern the state of war existing with Turkey.28-1 B
The Kemalists certainly possess the status oi belligerents and Keinal&apos;s powers received international recognition when the allied Powers invited him to the London Conference and negotiated with him. Fusion took place there between the two Ottoman delegations and the two Allies concluded agreements with Kemal.Since that time the Turkey of Constantinople and the Turkey of Angora have become one single international and juridical (? group omitted) personally responsible for its acts. It is responsible for the prolongation of war and it has eluded its international engagements. It profited by the long delay necessary for negotiating the treaty,to improve its military position and thus opposed the application of the treaty, and it instigated the Kemalists in defiance.of international engagements. The note argues that the allied action in preventing war material from reaching Kemal via Constantinople is not sufficient to render unnecessary the exercise of Greek control, as Turkey can receive supplies from other quarters and a very active contraband is taking place both in the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. The exercise of control by Greece is a means whereby she can diminish the power of resistance of the common enemy. If the occupation of Constantinople by the Allies is going to limit Greek action, it might cause considerable military inconvenience for Greece in the future, whereas if the relations of1 the Allies with the two parties in dispute are to assume any particular character this should be in the nature of reinforcing the belligerent rights&apos;of Greece.The note explains that Greece was obliged to anticipate Kemal&apos;s attack before he had obtained reinforcements. It reminds the Allies of the mandate originally given to Greece in Asia Minor, and states that as the Greek people undertook this mission in the common interests of the Allies they had a right to expect their support in completing the task.Order ,bij General Papoulas. On 2nd May Sir Horace Rum bold, reported [No. 314] from Constantinople that the commandant of the Greek naval base at Constantinople had communicated to the captains of the port the following substance of an order by General Papoulas elated 26th April : All communication by sea is forbidden between the southern coast of Marmora -and all other ports, including Constantinople. The zone affected by this measure comprises the coast occupied by the Greek forces, and. extends from Yalova to Karabigha (British zone).All arrival or departure of merchant shipping under whatsoever flag is formally forbidden as from the evening of 29th April.Any vessel arriving after this date will be seized, her cargo confiscated, and the crew brought before a court-martial. Foreign men-of-war may call in the prohibited zone, but any civilian landing from them will be submitted to a searching examination, even if accompanied by an officer, and may not remain in this zone without permission of the Greek military authorities.The departure of auy ordinary individual from the prohibited zone-by whatsoever ship or means is strictly forbidden.HUNGARY.The western Comitats. On 19th April Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 106] from Budapest to the following effect: The Austrian Minister in conversation with the first secretary stated that the negotiations between the Austrian and Hungarian Governments with regard to the question of the western comitats had broken down &quot;because his Government had maintained that the Conference of Ambassadors had only recommended to them that these negotiations should be limited to 11 frontiers and frontier watersheds having regard to the rights of proprietors of (? land),&quot; whilst the Hungarian Government had understood that the negotiations should extend to some kind of partition of the district under dispute. Further, that the Austrian Government did not recognize that it was in any way bound by the covering note of the treaty of the Trianon.It seems so important that these negotiations should be resumed that I venture to submit that the Conference of Ambassadors might send an identic note to the two Governments, urging on them the advisability of renewing pourparlers on a wider basis, in which the economic questions might be discussed in connexion with any possible cession of territory granted to Austria by the treaty of Saint-Germain.
ITALY.    ,,The Porto Bom, Conference [FOR., xli, p. 5].-On 24th April Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 138] that paras. 1-3. inclusive, 6-8 inclusive, and the first part of 11 (d) had been deleted from the draft programme of the Porto-Rosa conference. This had been done to meet the wishes of the Czechoslovak Government, in consequence of representations made to the secretary-general, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by the French charge d&apos;affaires.&apos; Fiumc. The following telegram [No. 143] was sent from Rome by Sir George Buchanan on 25th April:  The press reports that the elections for the Constituent Assembly have resulted in favour of the autonomy party headed by Zanella. This constitutes the defeat of the DAnnmizio element. The official Tribuna says to-night that the result in no way signifies that the electors have disowned their Jtalianisin.There are rumours of serious disturbances after the elections, of the recall of the Italian Minister from Fiume, and of the intention of the Italian Government to re-occupy the town with Italian troops.From what the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me this moruiag I gathered that there was no intention of sending Italian troops. Three hundred police have been lent to the Fiume authorities to maintain order during the elections.Telegraphing [No. 148] again on 28th April he said : The&apos; Fiume election resulted in a majority of over 1,500, out of some 8,000 voters, for the autonomy party under Zanella; (? 80) per- cent, of the electors are-said to have voted.While the negotiations in which the Italian Minister was participating were-proceeding yesterday with the provisional Government a party of Fascist! and Arditti seized the municipal hall, and after the ejection of the mayor, proclaimed the fall of the provisional Government and the institution of a directory headed by Signor Gigante and composed of five other citizens of Fiume. The commander of the Italian police is said to have counselled prudence, but in vain. The. new Government has announced that the elections are null and void and that it represents the Italian city of Fiume and is inspired with the traditions and spirit of D&apos;Anminzio&apos;s legionaries.. Signor Gigante was mayor of Fiume under D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s regime.The press reports that the new Government was acclaimed by a large crowd demonstrating in favour of Italy and of ITAnnunzio, and that the conditions in the town are normal though a great number of shops and factories are closed and there is a printers&apos; strike-The Fascisti movement has assumed of late exaggerated - and even dangerous proportions.Their present action at Fiume is of bad augury for the future as indicating a-disposition to intervene in the question oE external as well as of internal j)policy.I am making enquiries as to the attitude of the Italian Government towards the latest developments. A telegram from Fiume appearing in the press states that the Italian Government has intimated its views in favour of recognizing&apos; the result of the elections, but this is not an official announcement.On the following day Sir George further reported [No. 152] that the secretary-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whom he had questioned on the subject of Fiume, had expressed a hope that the efforts being made to effect a reconciliation between the two parties would be successful, though he could not say how the vexed question of the validity of the recent election would be decided.A. detachment of (? the Alpini) had been sent to maintain order at the urgent request &apos;of the inhabitants of both nationalities, and as the Italian Government was acting in close understanding with the Government of Belgrade there was no fear of international complications. The fact too that the mixed commission for the systematization of Fiume was to meet on 2nd May at Abbazia would help with the settlement.The revolutionary Government had handed over its powers to a special com-missioner, Signor Bellaschi, who was recognized by the Italian Government and had. -offered the necessary guarantees for safeguarding the Italian character of Fiume.&apos;   JAPAN.The Turkish Prisoners of War [F.C.R., xli, p. 6]. Referring to the question of the Turkish prisoners from Vladivostock on the steamer Heimei Mam, the following 28-1 C
information was telegraphed [No. 250] to. Sir Horace Rumbold at Constantinople by the Foreign Office on 23rd April: The Japanese Ambassador now informs us that the Greek Government, through the Greek Minister here, have agreed to the Japanese proposal that the prisoners should be landed at Constantinople, provided the Japanese Government, in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government, will afford adequate guarantees against their departure from their place of internment. With this object the Greek Government suggests that the prisoners be interned at Constantinople and placed, pending the cessation of hostilities, under the control of the allied military authorities.The Japanese High Commissioner at Constantinople is applying to the Turkish Government to intern these prisoners under the guarantees desired by the Greek Government. He has asked His Majesty&apos;s Government that you should be instructed to associate yourself with this application.On 2nd May a telegram [No. 168] was sent from the Foreign Office to Sir George Buchanan at Rome, and [No. 108] to Lord Granville at Athens, informing them that the Japanese. Government now suggested that these prisoners should be landed and interned in Italy. This appeared to His Majesty&apos;s Government the best possible solution in the circumstances.,Sir George Buchanan was instructed to support any representations which his Japanese colleague was instructed to make in this sense.Lord Granville was directed to inform the Greek Government that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould strongly favour this solution if and when the Japanese Govem-ment proposed it to the Greek Government.LITHUANIA.Question of de jure Recognition.  On 25th April Mr. Lowdon reported [No. 34] from Riga that the Lithuanian Government requested the support of the British Government in the matter of de jure recognition, which, according to the Lithuanian Foreign Office, M, Briand had promised their representative at the Polish-Lithuanian conference in Paris to recommend at the next meeting of the Supreme Council., MEXICO.The General Situation.- On 23rd April Mr. Cummings reported. [No. 29] from Mexico that increasing revolutionary activity of small groups had been reported from several states, and that it was admitted that leaders of earlier regimes were conspiring, some having actually taken arms. The Labour leaders were organizing an uprising with the declared intention of establishing a Soviet Government. The situation was disquieting, and. the opinion was gaining ground that the Government would not last.On 1st May Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 285] from Washington that the under-secretary of State had expressed the opinion that the recognition of President Obregon at present would be a repetition of the mistake made in recognizing President Carranza. The Government had so far taken no decision, and the under-secretary ex-pressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would inform, the United States Government of any reasons they might have for wishing early recognition.PERSIA.Detention of the Russian Minister\--On 21st April Mr. Norman sent the following telegram: The Prime Minister has telegraphed to the Russian Minister, who is on his way from Meshed to Teheran, that the Persian Government cannot allow him to-proceed to the capital while Russians under the disguise of a pseudo-Persian1 republican organization are attacking Persian troops in violation of the Russo-Persian treaty, and at the moment when British troops are withdrawing from Persia. Mehmendar has been instructed to detain the Russian Minister on the road, pending&quot; explanations.The Prime Minister is also telegraphing a protest to the Soviet Government, and adding that, if the Russians under the disguise of Bolshevism intend to renew the aggressions of czarist Russia; the Persian Government will take steps to proclaim, to.
the whole mussulman world, and to the proletariat of all countries, the flagrant tyranny to which the innocent people of Persia is being subjected by Russia.To the foregoing telegram Mr. Norman reported [No. 252] on 21st April that the&apos; Russian Minister had replied denying the Russian responsibility for the attacks on the Persian troops, and attributing the&apos; blame to the Persian Government for having failed to arrange for a mutual evacuation by forming an Anglo-Persian-Russian military commission. He criticized the withdrawal of British troops before the procedure of the withdrawal had been arranged with the opposing army, but under-took to put a stop to hostilities. The Russian Minister was continuing his journey to Teheran. The Prime Minister had been informed by Mushaver-ul-Mainalek that the Russian Soviet Government were not well disposed towards the present Persian Government.Russian Attitude. Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 25&apos;)] from Teheran on 24th April as follows: -Russian activity on the confines of Persia and Azerbaijan is -causing anxiety. The Russians have assumed the offensive at Pil-i-sowur and the Governor-General fears they intend to occupy the Ardebil district. The Prime Minister telegraphed a protest to the Russian Minister, who replied that the aggression was perhaps due to doubts entertained by the Caucasian-Azerbaijan view of the intentions of the new Persian Government,&apos;and to the uneasiness inspired by the long delay in allowing him to cross the frontier. He added that the Soviet Government has no knowledge of the aggression, and promised to take steps with a view to -end it.The Prime Minister is convinced that the Russians have hostile intentions against Persia.On 25th April Mr. Norman sent the following message: The Persian mission sent to discuss evacuation with the &quot; Persian national army&quot; has returned. The discussions were mainly conducted with the Russian commander although repre-sentatives of the Azerbaijan-Ghilan communists were present. The Russian com-mander stated that since the expected British representative on the commission had not appeared, he must refer to Moscow for instructions.He said that the recent bombardment was due partly to his temporary absence at Baku, and partly to the fact that a Persian cossack had tired a shot in the air,&apos; which had made the Bolshevik forces fear that the Persians were about to take the offensive. Pending the receipt of instructions from Moscow, an armistice has been arranged.The Persian commission was well received, but the Russians expressed distrust of the new Persian Government on account of their pro-British tendencies.Telegraphing again [no number] on 2nd May, Mr. Norman reported that the Persian consul at Erivan had arrived at Tabriz, and had had a conversation with His Majesty&apos;s consul regarding which the latter had reported as follows: &quot; The consul stated that all the Bolsheviks of importance with whom he conversed openly assert that they intend to come here eventually, and men are continually being sent with money for propaganda. To explain this to his Government was one of the chief causes of his coming here. The consul states that the Bolsheviks are behaving much better to local inhabitants than formerly.&quot;RUSSIA.General WrangeVs Army [F.O.R., xli, p. 10, under &quot;Serbia&quot;]. On 25th April .:Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 301] from Constantinople as follows : I have received a note from the Russian diplomatic agent on the subject of the -dispersal of General wrangel&apos;s army.He states their total is now 45,000. Of these, according to a report received from General wrangel&apos;s chief of the staff now in Belgrade, the Serbian Government would be -willing to accept from 7,000 to 10,000 at its own cost. 35,000 could be taken if financial help were forthcoming, or if the French Foreign Relief Organization would undertake their rationing.The Bulgarian and Czecho-Slovak Governments have agreed to receive a certain number, probably on the same conditions.Others may possibly be employed on public works in Mytelene and 2,000 to -3,000 repatriated to Serbia.
10Mr. Neratoff adds that he realizes that the French can no longer bear this burden-, alone, and are now reducing rations, which may produce unrest. *He concludes with, a strong appeal for the financial support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.I am referring in reply to Admiral de Robeck&apos;s note of 14th November, embody--ing your Lordship&apos;s telegram No. 1085, adding that I am certain that i-. view of the-advice given to General Wrangel by His Majesty&apos;s Government and our constant and declared attitude towards his Government, as well as the great expenditure and indefinite liability already incurred on behalf of earlier refugees, we shall be unable to see our way to rendering any further assistance.TURKEY.Scutari Gendarmerie Battalion. Lord Curzon. telegraphed [No. .189] to Lord Hardinge as follows on 22nd April: The French military authorities at Constantinople have suggested to General Harington the reconstitution of the Scutari gendarmerie battalion for the maintenance-of order on the Ismid peninsula. We agree with the War Office in favouring the proposal subject to the following four conditions, laid down in General Harington&apos;s reply to the French : (1) This shall be without prejudice to the fuuire action of His Majesty V-Government.(2) General Harington shall have direct relations with the Turkish chief of gendarmerie.(3) General Harington shall appoint or dismiss whomever he likes. (4) All officers shall be British and subject only to such inspectorate as General Harington may appoint.Please inform the French Government and ask for their concurrence, emphasizing the fact that this is a temporary measure to meet the present critical military situation.Changes in the Ministry. On 25th April Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 299] that it had been announced that morning that Moustafa Arif Bey, President of the Council, of State, and Zia Pasha, Minister of War, have been appointed acting Minister-of the Interior and acting Minister of Marine respectively. It was rumoured&apos; some clays ago that Izzet and Vith Pashas would remain in the Cabinet as Ministers without portfolio, but this is not confirmed. These two pashas show no disposition to-withdraw their resignations.        S .UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Naval Appropriation Bill. The following telegram [No. 281] was sent by Sir-Auckland Geddes on 30th April:  The Naval Appropriation Bill carrying a total of 8396,000,000 passed the House of Representatives on 28th April and was sent to the Senate. If, as is probable, the Senate again increases the appropriations, the bill will presumably be referred to a joint committee of the House and the Senate, the House members of which will, it is thought, refuse to agree to a vote of more than $400,000,000.The bill as submitted to the House on 28th April was in its original form, i.e.,. before amendments were made by the Senate. The amendment making appropriation conditional upon a disarmament conference being called by the President was-decisively rejected.It is impossible to forecast with precision at the present moment what will be-fhe ultimate state of the appropriation bill.   The situation remains fundamentally the same as in February of this year.   Press reports are apt to exaggerate the importance-of each phase of legislative procedure.    It should be recognized that there is at present no politically powerful  opinion in favour of disarmament, apart from., accomplished international agreement.
