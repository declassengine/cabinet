FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Italian Legation to be established. On 14th March Sir Ronald Graham tele-graphed [No. 137] from Rome that the press had reported a decision of the Council of Ministers to establish an Italian legation in Kabul in view of the establishment of the Afghan legation at Rome, and that the Marquis Paternp had been appointed to the post in the capacity of Minister Plenipotentiary.ALBANIA.The Revolt. On 15th March Mr. Eyres reported [No. 12] from Durazzo that the revolt had been completely suppressed. Ahmed Bey, at the head of 450 militia, had defeated the insurgents in one night and reoccupied Durazzo.   All was then quiet.The Italians in Albania.-The following telegram [No. 41] was sent from Belgrade by Sir Alba a Young on 19th March : The Minister for Foreign Affairs last night repeated to me, with apparently considerable satisfaction, news that had been received from Scutari, to the effect that the Albanian Government had requested the League of Nations (or conference of Ambassadors) to obtain the evacuation from Albania of all Italian forces, including the contingent at Scutari, and were determined, if satisfaction was not obtained that way, to expel the Italians by force.The Minister for Foreign Affairs assured the Italian Minister that no reinforce-ment had been sent to the Albanian frontier, but that the troops guarding the frontier had been aligned to meet any incursions connected with the recent troubles.ARGENTINE.The Coming President. According to a telegram [No. 26] received from Mr. Chalkley on 13th March, Dr. Alvear, the Argentine Minister at Paris, was designated on 12th March the radical candidate for the presidency of the republic, There are the strongest probabilities that he will be elected at the forthcoming election on 2nd April.AUSTRIA.Finance [F.C.R., lxiv, p. 21. The following telegram [No. 11] was sent from Vienna by Mr. Akers Douglas on 10th March :-The continued political crisis and the heavy German purchases of sterling for reparation payments have had a depressing effect on the market which may become acute.Mr. Young this morning told the Chancellor that, until he was satisfied that the financial reforms already announced would be introduced and vigorously executed, he would not consent to any issue out of British credit. This has been communicated, to the party leaders.In order to support the market in case of the Government giving the required assurances Mr. Young will consent to transfer a sum of (probably) 200,000L from the Austrian Government account to the account of the Austro-Hungariah Bank with the London, City and Midland on Monday. He asks that the Bank, of England may be informed at once and asked to effect this payment on the receipt of instructions, which will be sent in cypher through the legation. He..will arrange a regular method of operating the account when the composition of the Austrian Government is settled.BALTIC STATES.Warsaw Conference [F.O.R.. Ixii, p. 2]. Telegraphing [No. 29] from Riga on 20th March, Mi-. Wilton reported that the following were the principal points of agreement signed by the four Stales on 17th March : Confirmation of treaties with Russia; interchange of treaties already made with other countries ; no offensive treaty with another country ; commercial, and consular
agreements to be. concluded later; rights of minorities; arbitration in case of -disputes ; attitude of benevolence and consultation for concerted action in the event of an attack upon one of the four States by another country:; duration of agreement five years from date of ratification.Proposed Conference with Russia. On 20th March Mr. Wilton telegraphed :[1S1o. 31] that he understood that the Esthonian, Finnish and Lettish Foreign Ministers had decided to recommend their Governments not to accept a formal conference at Riga,, in view of the impossibility of the two first to attend. They had no objection to a discussion with their respective diplomatic representatives. The Moscow Government had previously given 25th March as the date of the arrival of its delegation at Riga.  .Telegraphing again [No. 32] on the following day, Mr. Wilton reported that the Lettish Foreign Minister had that day informed him that the Russian representative &apos; had now requested him to issue invitations to the Foreign Ministers of Russia, , Esthonia, Finland, Poland, and Lithuania to a conference at Riga on 28th March, and that he had sent out the invitations.EGYPT.Neio Status. On 15th March the following&apos;circular telegram was sent from the &apos; Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Washington, Copenhagen, Madrid, Athens, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, Belgrade, Berne and Tokyo: His Majesty&apos;s Government, with the approval of Parliament, have decided to terminate the protectorate declared over Egypt on the 18th December 1914, and to recognize herYas an independent sovereign State. In informing the Government to which you are accredited of this decision you should communicate the following notification: When the peace and prosperity of Egypt were menaced in December 1914 by the intervention of Turkey in the Great War in alliance with the Central Powers, His Majesty&apos;s Government terminated the suzerainty of Turkey over Egypt, took the..&apos; country under their protection and declared it to be a British protectorate.The situation is now changed. Egypt has emerged from the war prosperous -and unscathed, and His Majesty&apos;s Government, after grave consideration and in accordance with their traditional policy, have decided-to terminate the protectorate by a declaration in which they recognize Egypt as an independent sovereign State, while preserving for future agreements between Egypt and themselves certain matters in which the interests and obligations of the British Empire are specially involved. Pending such agreements the status quo as regards these matters will remain unchanged.The Egyptian Government will be at liberty to re-establish a Ministry of Foreign, Affairs and thus to prepare the way for the diplomatic and consular representation of Egypt abroad.Great Britain will not in future accord protection to Egyptians in foreign countries -except in so far as.may be desired by the Egyptian Government and pending the representation of Egypt in. the country concerned.The termination of the British protectorate over Egypt involves, however, no -change in the status quo as regards the position of other Powers in Egypt itself.The welfare and integrity of Egypt are necessary to the peace and safety of the British Empire, which will, therefore, always maintain as an essential British interest the special relations between itself and Egypt long recognized by other Governments. These special relations are defined in the declaration recognizing Egypt as an independent sovereign State. His Majesty&apos;s Government have laid them down as matters in which the rights and interests of the British Empire are vitally involved, and will, not admit them to be questioned or discussed by any other Power, In pursuance of this principle, which they hereby declare to all Powers, they will regard as an unfriendly act any attempt at interference in the affairs of Egypt by another, Power, and they will consider any aggression against the territory of Egypt as an act to be repelled with all the means at their command.King Fuad.-On Kith March Lord alien by reported [No. 127] that he had called at the palace that morning, accompanied by his staff, to offer his congratulations to, KingFuad on his assumption of the titles of &quot; Majesty &quot; and &quot; King of Egypt &quot; which had been announced in a special number of the Journal Official. His Majesty, in thanking His Majesty&apos;s Government for the confidence they had reposed in Egypt, trusted that the country would show itself worthy of this confidence and that both would work hand in hand for its welfare.38-4 A 2
GERMANY.Sale of Arms to Afghanistan. The following telegram [No. 19] was sent from the Foreign Office to Lord d&apos;Abernou on Sth March :-We are informed that the German Government has sold to the Afghan mission in Berlin a consignment of arms and ammunition, notably 6,000 rifles and 250 machine guns, through the intermediary of a certain Kurth, and they have been, or are in the act of being, shipped on the German steam yacht Moire at Flensburg, from where they will be conveyed to Riga and thence across Russia to Afghanistan. All the arms have the German Government mark and they are all numbered.As your Lordship is aware, the export by Germany of arms and munitions to foreign countries is prohibited by article 170 of the treaty of Versailles, and, if the facts are as stated, the breach of the treaty involved is of a most flagrant nature and will gravely compromise the German Government.You should see the Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately and insist on the German Government taking urgent action to stop the Mowe, or if she has already left Flensburg. to send a warship to intercept her and bring her into a German port.You should add that, should the German Government fail to take the course proposed, His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve the right to consider, in conjunction with their allies, the action necessary to make Germany conform to her obligations under the treaty.GREECE.Position of the Government. On 19th March Mr. Lindley reported [No. 98], from Athens that Mr. Goudas had obtained a vote of confidence in the Chamber by 164 against 86 ; there had been 53 abstentions and 23 mussulman deputies were not present. The minority consisted almost entirely of Venezelists. Unless the Chamber was adjourned the position of the Government could not be called secure, but the crises had shown that no alternative Government could at present secure a majority in the Chamber.HUNGARY.Frontiers. On 12th March Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 23] from Budapest, as follows: -Considerable surprise is expressed here at the resentment aroused in Austria by the request of the Hungarian Government for a modification of the west Hungarian frontier. In notifying the boundary commission of their wishes, it is pointed out that the Hungarian Government are only exercising a right admitted by all other limitrophe States, and that moreover under the Venice protocol the Austrian Govern-ment declared themselves prepared to conform with the decisions of the boundary commission subject to the final ruling of the League of Nations Council in cases of difference.The Minister for Foreign Affairs suggests that the Austrian Government are making use of this opportunity to create ill-will against Hungary, in order to divert public interest from their internal affairs and to strengthen their own position.ITALY.Flume. Sir Ronald Graham telegraphed [No. 125] as follows from Rome on 7th March : A press agency communique, which has the air of being inspired, states to-day that the present revolutionary Government of Fiume is not recognized by the Italian Government. Until a new Government has been set up Signor Castelli will act solely as representative of Italian interests at Fiume. Steps will be taken to summon a constituent assembly by agreement with various parties in the town. Italy will keep order in Fiume till a new Government has been set up, when Signor Castelli will become simply the Italian Minister. The Italian Government will oppose the formation of any Government which would represent the violation of the treaty of Rapallo such as a high commissioner or a provisional revolutionary Government. With a view to securing the return to normal conditions the following measures have been taken : (1) Passports are being refused to all non-Fiumans, and the frontier of Venezia Julia is being closely watched.
(2) Anns and ammunition in possession of private persons at Flume are beingconfiscated.(3) Foreign elements and those who took part in the recent disorders are being expelled from the town.Funds amounting to about 15,000,000 lire have been placed at Signor CastehTs -disposal to assist the economic reconstruction of Fiume. Signor Gaccia Domhiione, the Italian Minister at Fiume, has been given leave of absence.The Prime Minister, whom I saw yesterday, repeated to me the assurance given by the&apos;Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Italian Government intended to respect the treaty of Hapallo.Declaration, of Policy. On .1.5th March Sir Ronald Graham reported [No. 140] as follows:---&quot;On the re-opening of the Chamber to-day, the President of the Council made a declaration of policy which was well received. In emphasizing the necessity of loyalty towards their allies he put in the first place Italy&apos;s friendship for England as traditional, and as one of the principal bases of all Italian policy.As regards Fiume, be declared the Government^ intention to respect international obligations, and to promote good relations and commercial intercourse with Jugo-Slavia by quickly carrying through the negotiations necessitated by the treaty of Rapallo.PERSIA.Anglo-American Oil Negotiations [F.C.R., Ixiv, p. 5]. Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 1.44] on 7th March that the Prime Minister, in course of conversation, had clung to his own proposal regarding the concession being granted nominally to the Standard Oil Company only [No. 135], and reference to the Anglo-Persian Company being eliminated. This Sir Percy declined to contemplate as it would leave the latter company without any legal title. He had told the Prime Minister that if the Persian Government declined to avail themselves of a course, at once honourable and advantageous, to escape from their embarrassments, he could see no possibility of helping them.Sir Percy reported that he was acting in complete accord with the United States Charge cPAffaires.Telegraphing [No. 122] from Washington on Sth March, Sir Auckland Geddes reported that the State Department had received a telegram from Teheran in which their Charge d&apos;Affaires endorsed Sir Percy Loraines statement regarding their harmonious working. The Department had agreed with the representatives of both countries that better results might follow a waiting policy, if the Persian Government failed to ratify the concessions. The unlikelihood of the Persian Government being-able to obtain a loan elsewhere, should the Standard Oil Company loan fall through, was considered to be a factor which would induce a more reasonable attitude on the part of the Persian Government.Referring to a statement by Mushir-el-Dowleb. reported in [No. 135] that the Persian Government received $1,000,000 in advance from the American Company, on the understanding that it involved nothing more than the promise of repayment before December, which Sir Percy Loraine qualified as a misconception, the latter telegraphed [No. 148] on 13th March as follows-: The Persian Government have received 200,O00L through the Imperial Bank of Persia.Sir Percy Loraine supplemented the foregoing on 15th March by the following telegram [No. 15.0]:-The Persian Government maintains categorically and officially that the 200,0001. advance which it has accepted is altogether independent of both the concession and the $5,000,000 loan, and therefore does not commit it in any way to the grant of the concession.Sir Percy enquired whether this was the case.On the same date, in continuance of the above, Sir Percy Loraine sent the following telegram:  I am quite satisfied that the Prime Minister has acted himself in good faith in accepting the advance; he has read me telegrams exchanged with the Persian Minister at Washington which prove that before handling the money he sought and - obtained the latteFs categorical assurance that the advance was made in accordance
with the Medjliss resolution, and involved the Persian Government in no obligation, whatever, other than repayment by December next.If my view is correct that the advance is on account of the joint $5,000,000* loan, and implies the acceptance of the concession, then the Persian Minister has wilfully misled his Government.His Highness, as the result of my representations, has suspended all further payments out of the money received, and tells me officially that the Persian Govern--ment will reimburse it if my view is correct.   What are the terms of the loan ?In reply to this Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 79] on .18th March as follows :  The position of the advance is not quite clear, but it seems to me that, if thePersian Government accept it, they become morally bound to grant the concession.The latter cannot be dissociated from the advance made by a company only created for its exploitation.RUSSIA.Split in the Communist Party.--Mi: Grove reported from Moscow on 17th March that the invitation to Genoa appeared to have caused a split in the communist party ; whilst the difficulties created by the postponement of the conference and the elaborate preliminary conditions seemed to have made the position of the Soviet Government more precarious and to have, enabled the extremists to rally to the call of danger and thereby extend their influence. There was indeed some evidence to show that the extremists were gaining the upper hand in the Government.SERBIA.The Recognition of Albania, On 14th March Sir Alban Young telegraphed [No. 40], from Belgrade that the political director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had told him that the Serbian Government had been about to recognize the Government of Albania and to despatch a diplomatic representative to Tirana, when they learnt that Hassan Pristina and Bairam Tsur were marching on the seat of Government with apparent chances of success. In view of the character of those brigands, and not, knowing to whom to accredit their representative, they were desisting from these intentions.Fiume.-On 19th March Sir Alban Young reported [No. 42] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him that the Government were demanding that, if the Italian Government had really found that the occupation of Fiume was necessary, they too should participate in the occupation. He admitted, however, that this demand, if resisted, would not be pushed to the extent of threatening peaceful relations between the two countries. At the same time .a one-sided occupation of Fiume was bound to-make a painful impression on public opinion.TURKEY.The Greek Patriarchate.  Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 165] from Constantinople as follows on 15th March : At the last session of the spiritual and lay councils of the patriarchate, the-Patriarch Meletios stated that the patriarchate, which had long fought for the emanci-pation of its spiritual children without distinction of race or language, was happy to witness the emancipation of several orthodox States. It had never sought to interfere in the internal affairs of these States. Its aim was and is to assist populations-desirous of independence.Therefore the patriarchate had assumed its well-known attitude towards King Constantino. As the Allies are at war with the person of that sovereign, Christians of the east risk seeing their hopes of emancipation dashed. The declarations made at Paris and London show that unless King Constantino is sacrificed, the unredeemed will be lost.The patriarchate was authorized to telegraph good wishes to the new Greek Government, which was expected to be more &quot; moderate &quot; than its predecessor, but has not yet clone so.Telegraphing again [No. 1661 on the following day, Sir Horace further reported that he had learnt that the Holy Synod of the oecumenical patriarchate had decided unanimously to annul the arrangement of 1908, by which. Greek churches in Europe and America were placed, under the jurisdiction of the Church of Athens, and to-restore them to the jurisdiction of the patriarchate at Constantinople.
