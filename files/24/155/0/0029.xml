AUSTRIA.The Ex-Empress-On 16th May Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 49] as follows to Sir Esme Howard in Madrid : The Spanish Ambassador is being informed that in the interests of peace His Majesty&apos;s Government bad thought it desirable that the Ex-Empress should not be allowed to leave Madeira until she had given a pledge to abstain from all attempts at restoration. Seeing, however, that the French Government, instead of continuing to act conjointly with the Allies through the medium of the Ambassadors&apos; conference as hitherto, have already intimated their readiness to agree to her unconditional departure, and that this fact is probably known to the Ex-Empress, it has probably now been made very difficult to obtain a pledge from her before leaving.In these circumstances, and having regard to her condition, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not feel justified in that case in opposing her departure from Madeira on the 18th, for which it is understood she is making arrangements. They still consider, however, that a pledge ought eventually to be obtained, and they will impress on the Ambassadors&apos; conference the view that the grant of an allowance should be made conditional on this.CHINAInternal Troubles. Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed [No. 144] as follows on 2nd May:--Hostilities between Fengtien and Cbihli positively commenced on 27th April on the Tientsin-Pukow railway south of Tientsin and on the Peking-Hankow railway about 15 miles south-west of Peking.The impression is that both Wu-Pei-fu and Chang Tso-lin are in earnest and that fighting may assume serious proportions. Steps have been taken to maintain open communication with the sea. British and French men-of-war are at Tientsin, Japanese and American at Chinwangtao.Of the provinces north of the Yangtze, Shantung, Hupei, Honan, Shensi, Kiangsu and part of Anhui are siding with Wu-Pei-fu. Chekiang, which controls the Shanghai garrison, is neutral. The bulk of the Chinese fleet on the Yangtze has also declared for Wu-Pei-fu, and a squadron started north to attempt to cut the Peking-Mukden line in the rear of Chang Tso-lin&apos;s forces.Sun Yat Sen has dismissed Chen Chiang Ming from the civil governorship of Canton, with the result that the advance of the southern force via Kiangsi and Hunan to the Yangtze is as likely as not to be delayed even if civil war in Canton province does not follow.Telegraphing again [No. 152] on 5th May, Sir Beilby reported that the Fengtien troops were in full retreat and that many trainloads had passed Tientsin. Chang Tso-lin was reported to be on his way back to Mukden. Wu-Pei-fu had advanced half-way to Tientsin. He apparently had no desire to come to Peking, and only said that he would ensure the calling of the national convention. Now that Chang Tso-lin was decisively beaten there was general relief in Peking. The city gates were still closed, but normal conditions might be expected in a.few days.On 11th May he again telegraphed [No. 163], saying that mandates had been issued cashiering, and ordering the arrest of the Premier (Liang Shi-hyi), the Minister of Communications, and the Minister of Finance, all of whom were in hiding; also removing Chang Tso-lin from all his posts. Chang Tso-iin was astride the Peking-Mukden railway south of Shan-hai-knan, where he was bringing up reinforcements, and appeared disinclined to accept deposition without a struggle. Conditions were returning to the normal, but the city markets were still closed. A new Cabinet had not yet been formed.Three days later he reported [No. 166] that Chang Tso-lin had declared his independence and was reinforcing his positions on the railway between Shan-hai-tuan.
and Tougshan. His first line of. defence was situated in the heart of the Kailan Company&apos;s coalfields, thus infringing the protocol and deliberately menacing British property. YVu-Pei-fu was assembling troops for attack. The officer commanding the troops, at his, Sir Beilby Alston&apos;s, request, had supplied a guard for the mine property, and he had sent a consular officer to Tongshan to endeavour to minimize the- danger to the mines from the impending hostilities.Release of a Portion of the Customs Surplus. The following telegram [No. 161] was sent by Sir Beilby Alston on 12th May :  The Chinese Government asked the corps diplomatique last week to authorize the.release of. $600,000 of ,the customs surplus to pay off, feed and repatriate, (group omitted) of Chang-TsoliiPs defeated army around Peking. After considerable discussion the corps diplomatique replied, granting the release of $300,000, and expressing, on my suggestion, the hope that this would be the beginning of disbandment in accordance with the recommendation of the Washington conference..The present Government have exhausted all means of borrowing from the railways, salt, &amp;c, and are making increasing demands on the customs for every department of Government, ignoring the fact that the customs surplus is definitely pledged under a presidential mandate for the consolidated internal loan service: The Inspector-General of customs has warned the corps dqolomatique that since the end of April it is impossible to estimate the effect on the customs receipts of the present hostilities and. the possible drop in exchange, and that no further charges should be sanctioned for the present. .......At the corps diplomatique meeting yesterday a number of requests from the Chinese Government for releases were presented, but action was postponed pending the consideration of the situation as a whole, both politically and financially, at the next meeting on 18th May.FINLAND.Resignation of the Cabinet. On 13th. May Mr. Rennie reported [No. 68] from Helsingfors that, in view of an adverse vote of the Diet, the Government had resigned. The President had requested the Ministers to carry on until a new Cabinet was formed, i He added that the foreign Affairs committee had drafted a resolution to be passed by Parliament expressing dissatisfaction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; action in connexion with the Warsaw agreement.GREECE.New Cabinet.-Telegraphing [Nos. 173, 174 and 182] on. 11th, 13th and. 16th May, Mr, Lindley reported from Athens (1) that the financial debate in the Chamber had ended by the Government obtaining a vote of confidence by one vote ; (2) that the Prime Minister, having failed to persuade the opposition leaders to join the Government, had resigned; and (3) that M. Stratos had j formed a Government exclusively of his own. party with himself Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of War, It was not expected, that the Government would survive the first meeting of the Chamber, but M. Stratos would have secured his object, having been Prime Minister and seeing the correspondence at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.GUATEMALA.Recognition by the United States.-On 11th May Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 227] from Washington that the United States Government had recognized the Guatemalan Government on 15th April, and that the State Department had informed him that all political prisoners had been released and that the Government was to be regarded as one of the most stable in Central America.JAPAN.The Prime Minister and. the Cabinet. On 9th May Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 120] that, with a view to Cabinet reconstruction, the Prime Minister had recently attempted to force the resignation of the Minister of Education and the Minister of Railways, but, as they had refused and were supported by a strong minority of the ministerialist party, the Prime Minister had given way, thus further compromising his position.
LIBERIA.Loan from the United States.- On the 11th May Sir Auckland Geddes reported&apos; [No. 228] from Washington that the House of Representatives had, on the previous day, passed, by a majority, of nine, a bill providing for a loan of 15,000,000 to Liberia! The bill would now go to the Senate.PERSIA.The Political Situation [F.C.R., XVIII, p. 3]. On 8th May Sir Percy Loraiue telegraphed [No. 215] announcing the resignation of the Prime Minister, who had adopted that course in preference to compliance with the demand of the Minister of War, that he should suppress the newspapers subsidized by the Russians, which had attacked the latter. Sir Percy was endeavouring to effect a reconciliation, but had doubts of his success.On 13th May Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 220] as follows The Shah has left the .Medjliss to decide the question of the premiership, saying that he cannot judge at that distance. The Medjliss has begged Muslur-ed-Dowleli to withdraw his resig-nation, but he has not yet consented. If his refusal is maintained, a parliamentary majority will probably be in favour of Kawam Sultaneh.Russo-Persian Relations [F.C.R., XVIII, p. 2]. Telegraphing [No. 210] on 5th May, Sir Percy Loraine reported that Rothstein had been relieved by Shumyatski as Charge c&quot;,&quot;Affaires. The latter was said to have taken part in the Baltic fleet revolution as a sailor, but had recently been employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Moscow. He was a fervent communist of about 35 years of age and one of Trotsky &apos;s supporters.The Military Attache, Rogachov, has been relieved by Apin, aged about 27, who,&apos; before the revolution, had been a commercial student in Moscow. The individuals who had been relieved were to leave Teheran in the following week..In a later telegram [No. 222] dated 16th May, Sir Percy reported that Rothstein ,was remaining in Teheran, his relief having been recalled to Moscow.German Enterprise.- Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 22.1] on .1.3th May that he had received information of the conclusion of an arrangement between Germany and Russia providing navigation concessions on the.Volga, whereby through transit from Hamburg would be ensured. The Persian Government, was being approached by the Germans with a view of obtaining navigation rights on the Caspian Sea.Anglo-American Oil Negotiations* [F.C.R., LXVI, p. 7].-On 4th May a telegram [No. 112] was sent from the Foreign Office to Sir Percy Loraine saying that Mr. Shuster had informed the Standard Oil Company that the Persian Government had declined to accept the proposal for the omission of the preamble to the northern oil concession. In view of the possible change in. the Persian Cabinet the Foreign Office suggested the desirability of marking time.In acknowledging the above Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 211] on 5th May, that in view of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company having consented to the Standard Oil Company being the sole nominal concessionaire, and to the staff and management being exclusively American [No. 209], the only apparent obstacle that remained was the right of the Standard Oil Company to withdraw; in his opinion, therefore, it would be expedient to try to get the concession pressed through before the fall of the existing Government.He anticipated that the Cabinet would obtain a fresh lease of life from the impending bank advance, as in the absence of competition its fail would be the consequence of inanition rather than of adversity.While he still preferred the formula suggested by himself [No. 159], he thought that on the United States Minister receiving the instructions of the State Depart-ment, the concession could be put through in accordance with the modified views of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the omission of the withdrawal clause.Telegraphing [No. 212] again on 7th May, Sir Percy reported that the represen-tative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had been informed by the Prime Minister of his intention to recommend that evening to the new inter-party commission of the Medjliss the grant of the proposed northern concession subject to the following-alterations : (a) omission of the preamble; (b) the Standard Oil. Company to be the sole nominal concessionaire, with company formation, rights as in the cPArcy concession; (c) the deletion of the Standard Oil Company!s withdrawal clause.   The
Prime Minister anticipated that the commission would accept the proposal as: -amended.Referring to Foreign Office telegram [No. 112], Sir Percy added that the Prime Minister had stated that he was unaware that Mr. Sinister had rejected the concession without the preamble, on behalf of the Persian Government, and that such action did not at all represent his own views.Indian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf.-In reply to Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s telegram [No. 197] of 24th April, the following instructions were telegraphed [No. 114] to him on 4th May :-You may inform the Persian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government agree in principle to the abolition, or the transference, of post offices, provided you are able to obtain guarantees for the maintenance, under the supervision of an European or American Director-General of Posts, of a postal service equally efficient and comprehensive as that hitherto rendered by the British Indian offices. In that case you may proceed with the arrangement with the Persian Government for a joint commission of experts from, the Persian, Irak and Indian postal administrations to discuss in detail the procedure for the surrender of the offices as proposed by you, with the modification, however, which the Government of India has pressed, that the Persian administration shall become responsible for the branches of the postal service in each office as transferred, engaging if necessary the services of some of the present personnel for the performance of special services for which the Persian clerks are not yet trained.Local supervision of the service in the Gulf ports and the oilfields can presumably be arranged by the above-mentioned Director-General, who would be able to select a local director. I realize the prejudice entertained by Persians against Indians, but it may be possible to suggest to the Director-General informally the selection of an Indian as local director, if Indian postal clerks are engaged temporarily to carry on the special service not hitherto rendered by Persian post offices.If in your opinion the participation of Sir A. T. Wilson or other representative&apos; of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the detailed negotiations regarding the service at the oilfields is desirable, you are authorized to arrange its adoption locally.SERBIA.American Loan. On 11th May Mr. Strang reported [No. 65] from Belgrade that according to an official communique issued that morning the Government had decided overnight in principle to accept an offer of a loan from the Blair group in New York and had authorized the Minister of Finance to conclude the negotiations. The amount was said to be $100,000,00(1 issued at 86 and paying 8 per cent. The details were still to be arranged and the loan must of course pass the Chamber.TURKEY.Minorities in Asia Minor. -On 12th May Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 205] as follows to Sir Horace Rumbold : The information reported by you as received in the main from American relief workers reveals such an appalling tale of barbarity and cruelty, now being practised by the Angora Turks as part of a systematic policy of extermination of the Christian minorities in Asia Minor, that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have in the proposed terms of peace assumed a serious responsibility for the future protection of these minorities, cannot allow such reports to remain uninvestigated, or such incidents to-continue unchecked. I am informing the French, Italian and American Ambassadors -of our opinion, with a view to securing their co-operation in the action which I now propose, and I am requesting them to ask their Governments to send instructions to their High Commissioners at Constantinople to act in-concert with you. My proposal is that each of the four Powers should at once depute a carefully selected officer to proceed to Trebizond, or whatever Black Sea port may be most suitable for the purpose, with a view to proceeding to such places in the interior as may best enable them to conduct the necessary investigation. The permission of the Angora autho-rities will have to be sought and facilities demanded. It will be difficult for them to refuse these, since it is their contention either that the deportations and massacres
have not taken place, or that they have been provoked by the conduct of the Greek, and other minorities concerned. Should permission, nevertheless, be refused, His Majesty&apos;s Government will have to reconsider their entire attitude towards the peace proposals, which obviously could not lie pursued with any cliauce of success in such conditions as I have described. It is inconceivable that- Europe should agree to-hand back to Turkish rule, without the most stringent guarantees, communities who-would be liable to be treated in the manner described by competent American witnesses, whose reports, moreover, are confirmed by independent information in our possession.VENEZUELA.Re-election of the President. Telegraphing [No. 1] from Caracas on 3rd May,, Mr. Beaumont reported that Congress had that day unanimously re-elected M. Gomez. President of the Republic for the period 1922 to 1929.
