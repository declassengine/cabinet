FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ALBANIA.Situation on the Southern Frontier. The following telegram [No. 295] was sent from the Foreign Office.to Lord Granville in Athens on 28th October : His Majesty&apos;s consul at Durazzo reports that the situation on the southern frontier of Albania is menacing. -Twelve thousand Greek comitajis, with artillery, and some regular troops are said to be assembling, and the support of two battleships under the guise of mutineers is even spoken of.Without assuming responsibility for the complete accuracy of these reports, you should make immediate representations to the Greek Government, saying that if there is any violation of the Albanian southern frontier, as defined in 1913, it will he impossible to absolve the Greek Government, from all responsibility.ARABIA.Negotiations with King Hussein [F.C.R., liii, p. 2]. Telegraphing [No. 598] from Cairo on 26th October, Mr. Scott transmitted the following message from King Hussein for the Prime Minister : -The good news communicated to me by the British Agent at Jeddah of the decision of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to visit us has overwhelmed me with pleasure.To facilitate the aim (sie), and in honour of His Royal Highness&apos;s visit, I imme-diately signed the treaty demanded and sent it to the British Agent at Jeddah, leaving the discussion of our remaining known and vital demands to your Excellency&apos;s good will and good feelings.The British Agent returned the signed treaty, insisting on including two articles, No. 2 and No. 5, of the treaty, which articles have already been cancelled during our negotiations with Colonel Laurence, owing to the fact that they implied a reflection of a charge of dishonesty and treachery on my behalf. Moreover, the fundamental meaning of these two articles is Well understood in the other articles of the treaty I signed. Therefore this action shows that there is a secret wash aimed at, and, if so, I do not see the necessity of continuing the discussion on such subjects.To safeguard the interests and feelings., I hasten to point out the situation to your Excellency, as I never want to refuse the wishes of Great Britain or to be a stone in the way of her policy, and I am still faithful to what I declared in my letter dated 21st El-Ekda 1336.I am feeling quite confident that I have fulfilled my duties of sincerity and friendship; moreover, I am still, and shall continue to be, faithful to these sublime and unblemished duties.Major Marshall had already reported [No. 91] from Jeddah King Hussein&apos;s action in regard to Articles 2 and 5, adding that he had also made an addition to another article. . He, Major Marshall, was of opinion that it would be useless to continue the negotiations and recommended that the Prince of Wales should not pay his proposed visit.AUSTRIA.Venice Conference [F.C.R., liv, p. 2]. On 19th October Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 242] from Vienna as follows : The Chancellor laid the result of the Venice proceedings.before the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs last night and made out a good case for acceptance.The German nationalists opposed the acceptance of the plebiscite for the Oedenburg district unless the plebiscite also took place in southern Tyrol and German Bohemia.   Finally the following resolution was passed : &quot;The attitude of the Allies since the ratification of the. treaty of Trianon shows that they are unwilling to carry out the important territorial provisions of the treaty
of St. Germain which are favourable to Austria. In consequence the Federal Govern-rnent is empowered to continue the negotiations begun in Venice, keeping a close watch over the interests of Austria and the population of Burgenland and to conclude them (? in accordance with) the constitution.&quot;All the speakers laid stress on the necessity for the plebiscite being held under proper conditions, and took for granted the protection of the allied troops as promised by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs. The negotiations are likely to be long, and it is to be hoped that in the meantime the bands will withdraw,BALTIC STATES.Vilna.-On 24th October Lord Curzon informed [No. 4] Mr. Wilton at Riga that he was authorized to express in the clearest language the dismay with which His Majesty&apos;s Giovernment would view any action by the Lithuanian Government tending to repudiate the declaration of the Lithuanian delegation at Geneva. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciated the difficult position in which the Lithuanian Govern-. ment found themselves as-a result of the inflammation of public opinion, but sincerely trusted that the Government would be able to treat the matter on broad lines, and avoid any action which would tend to dissipate the feeling of renascent confidence in the possibility of a final settlement of this long outstanding question engendered by the recent action of the Lithuanian delegation at Geneva.The following telegram [No. 62] from His Majesty&apos;s Minister was sent from Kovno by Mr. Dilley on 31st October :-Vilna has been systematically Polonised for the last nine months and this is still continuing. The Foreign MinisteFs idea of provisional administration by the so-called purely indigenous elements appears to me to foreshadow eventual federation with Poland. ...I am in &quot;entire agreement with Mr. Max MulleFs second remark to the Foreign Minister. A form of provisional administration accerjted by both the Warsaw and the Kovno Governments would go someway towards the creation of friendly relations and the eventual settlement of. the Vilna question. &apos; It might be possible to induce the Kovno Government to discuss this point, but I fear no agreement between the two Governments is likely to result therefrom.Public feeling is less intense, but is still very strong against the Poles. Russian and German adverse influences are at work and the strong opposition of the War Minister to the acceptance of M. Hymans in the present form continues.BRAZIL.Presidential Election.-On 20th October Sir John Tilley reported [No. 171] from Rio de Janeiro that, Senhor Bemardes had issued his programme the evening before at a banquet, the following being some, of the points : M.ore efficient co-operation between the Government and Parliament and the appearance of Ministers in Congress. Careful financial administration with encouragement of exportation; the cheapening of the means of transport (this may affect British railway companies); effective defence of national coal with a view to its exclusive use (this coincides with a rumour of an immediate duty on foreign coal) j the foundation of a great mining industry (I hope the Anglo-Brazilian Syndicate contract will go through almost immediately); the foundation of a National Bank issue and re-discount; industrial measures for the benefit of workmen and the development of agriculture.During and after the banquet there was considerable noise and excitement in the neighbourhood, which was&apos;strongly policed.About 60 arrests were made and a Jew people were injured. The police fired at least three times, but only one paper which I have seen mentions this, and that very briefly.CHINA.The Washington Conference. The following, telegram [No. 392] was sent from Peking by Sir Beilby Alston on 20th October: In discussing yesterday questions connected with the Washington conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that one of China&apos;s desires, which she put
forward, was for a surtax on-the customs tariff. The tariff had been drawn up some-60 years ago since (? when) China&apos;s administrative expenses had greatly increased owing to.the introduction of reforms, such as public education and the police, and the provinces were no longer in a position to supply the central Government with,a revenue. The latter now require some $4,000,000 to $5,000,000 a month to maintain the different Ministries, most of which had until now been working without pay. The-situation was extremely serious, and might result in the disappearance of the present Government with or without disorder. I replied that, while sympathizing with China&apos;s difficulties, I could not help feeling that it was the burden of military expenditure and corruption, rather than legitimate (? expenditure) on administrative reforms that was the cause of the present trouble, and that until a disbandment of troops took place no improvement could be expected. In any case no increase on the tariff would commend itself to the foreign Powers unless it were known to what purposes the proceeds were to be devoted.- The Inspector-General of Customs continues to be besieged by the Government and the banks Lo save the situation. He has expressed himtelf as powerless to help them, and has now laid the situation before my Japanese, French and United States colleagues and myself as representing the Consortium of Powers (? with a view to) birr. makirig representations to our Governments.Arms Embargo. On 25th October Sir Pell by Alston informed [No. 398] the-Foreign Office that His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton had recently reported that further large supplies for the arsenal, of which an vAmerican had been appointed engineer-in-chief last March, were reaching Canton.The United States naval attache admitted that supplies were being imported via Manila, and deplored that the absence of necessary legislation in the United States made this possible.Again, Germany not being a party to the arms agreement of May 1.919, German-firms were reported to be actively importing munitions of war and aeroplane parts.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Relations loith Hungary. On 28th October Lord Curzon instructed [No. 89] Sir George Clerk as follows : You should strongly impress on the Government to which you are accredited that any hostile action on their part to Hungary without previous understanding with the principal Allies can only involve them in grave difficulties, and will have the effect of not merely placing them in serious opposition to the allied Governments, but will lose them the sympathy and goodwill of the whole world. The Hungarian Government have throughout the crisis shown their good faith, and have loyally acted in the spirit of the treaty and of their general obligations ; and so soon as the Ex-Emperor is safely removed from the country under allied surveillance, and the question of abdication or dethronement is definitely settled, there will remain no cause for uneasiness in the neighbour States which would justify the menacing attitude they appear to be still adopting.[Telegrams in identical terms were sent to Belgrade and Bucharest.]FINLAND.Commercial Treaty with Estlionia. Mr. Rennie telegraphed [No. 153] from Helsingfors on 31st October that a commercial treaty between Finland and Esthonia had been signed on 29th October. The. main point was that tariff reductions had been made exclusively in each otheFs favour as regarded natural produce. For industrial products manufactured in the respective countries the tariff reductions would be from 10 to 80 per cent. Other clauses concerned navigation, freights, taxes,, -cables, consular representation, &amp;c.GERMANY.The Cabinet.-On 27th October Lord rPAbernon reported [No. 502] that the President of the republic had charged Herr Wirth with the duty of forming a Ministry of Affairs to carry on and to put- through the Upper Silesia decision.
In a letter addressed to Herr Wirth, the President had expressed his regret atthe impossibility, at the moment, of constituting a broader coalition, which, however,remained his final object.The following old Ministers would not form part of the new combination : BE. Rosen, Rathenau, Schiller and Gradnauer.   Their places were taken by majoritysocialists and centials of no special colour or distinction.Roth the democrats and the people&apos;s party had exercised their influence againstmembers of their parties taking office-Public opinion regarded the solution as poor and temporary.   There was sometendency to consider the Ministry not only as a stop-gap, but almost, as scapegoats.HUNG ART.The Ex-King.-Qn 22nd October Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 319] the following literal translation of a note which he and his colleagues had presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that morning : &quot;Having ascertained this, morning that the Ex-King of Hungary has entered -Hungarian territory, we have the honour to draw your immediate attention to the declaration of the Conference of Ambassadors, which we presented. to you on 3rd April last, regarding the formal aud absolute determination of the Entente Powers to oppose the accession to the throne of a prince of the house of Habsburg. This declaration of 3rd April ran as follows.&apos;&apos;&apos; [Here follows the text of the note of, 3rd April.]   The note then proceeds : &quot; In consequence of the above text, we are under -the obligation of formally inviting the Hungarian Government to take forthwith all necessary -measures to secure once more the expulsion of the Ex-King from his former dominions.&quot; As your Excellency must readily realize that our (? demarche) is above all prompted by the desire of our Governments to maintain peace in Central Europe, we venture to express the hope that the Hungarian Government will take immediate action in the matter.&quot;: Telegraphing [No. 35(3] again on the same day Mr. Hohler reported that the&apos; Hungarian Government had replied that they would not fail to conform to the desires expressed by us. They firmly maintained the point of view laid down by law that King Karl could not exercise sovereign rights in. Hungary, and that he would be obliged to leave the country forthwith, the necessary steps to that end having already been taken. The Minister of Cults was leaving that evening with a copy of the note, which had been signed afresh, aud would try to stop him. The railway had been torn up near Komarom.The Crisis. Telegraphing [No. 400] on 30th October, Mr. Hohler reported that, the Hungarian Government had decided to address to us a note stating that they placed themselves entirely in the hands of the Great Powers for the solution of the present crisis. They had abstained from taking any military measures on the advice of the representatives of the Entente, and were consequently without defence; they solicited the Great Powers to stop the aggression of the Czechs and the Serbs and to obtain guarantees for the safeguarding of the rights and interests of Hungary in case of attack.      . .     &apos;&apos;On the following day Mr. Holder further telegraphed [No. 406] as follows;  The&apos;Prime Minister has officially informed us that the Hungarian Government, intends to adhere to the policy indicated in my telegram No. 400, placing themselves unreservedly in the hands of the Great Powers and conforming themselves entirely to their decisions. Accordingly he made a declaration that all the Habsburgs should be excluded from the throne and that the Government would secure the passage through Parliament of a law to that effect. He hoped&apos;that this would be sufficient to stop the entry of Serbian or Czecli troops into Hungary. On the other, hand, whilst it.was obviously impossible to ask us for a guarantee that they should not enter, yet-he did request that the Great Powers should give a guarantee that they would in that .-case taike every possible step for causing them to withdraw within a very short time-and for making them responsible for any damage that might be done.We have telegraphed this to the Conference, expressing the hope that we may be&quot; authorized without delay to give such an assurance, which we think entirely reasonable and very necessary for reassuring the people of this country.   Of course, if Czech or&apos;, 34-1 J3
Serbian troops enter, we think it almost impossible that some incident will not occur which will bring on hostilities despite any orders which the Hungarian Government may issue.The representatives of the Little Entente have been informed of the declaration made to us on the Habsburg question.Referring to the foregoing message, Mr. Hohler reported. [No. 410] on 1st November as follows :-In a written reply which I received last night, the Hungarian Government states that it accepts without restriction the decision of the Conference for the exclusion of the Habsburgs, and takes formal obligation of procedure to its execution without delay. For this purpose it will at once convoke Parliament, and guarantees that the law of dethroning Karl and all members of the Habsburg family shall be voted within eight days from the embarkation of the former on a British ship,PERSIA.Agreement with Russia [F.C.R., liv, p.&apos; 6]. Mr. Bridgemau telegraphed [No. 584] on 19th October that a Persian&apos; Mission to Angora, under Mumtaz-ed-Dowleh, left Tehran, 17th October, for Tabriz.South Persia Rifles [F.C.R., liv, p. 5]. On 20th October Mr. Bridgeman traus-mitted a message from the South Persia Rifles at Shiraz, saying that the disbandment would be completed at Shiraz and Kerman about 25th October, excepting small parties retained as escorts for the &quot;British personnel, which would be disbanded on arrival at their destination. The forces remaining at Shiraz, with the British and Indian personnel, would then proceed to Bushire to be disbanded there about 5th November. Pending permission to close down finally, the headquarters would remain at Bushire to settle any outstanding questions.Referring to&apos;the telegram [No. 412] from the Secretary of State of 18th October, Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 591] on 24th October that he had received a communi-cation, conveyed verbally, from the Prime Minister, to the effect that the Persian Government required an immediate loan and a monthly instalment to enable them to carry out certain proposed reforms by which it was calculated that the annual revenues Would be very largely increased. Among them was the engagement of an American financial adviser and a foreign military adviser. The Prime Minister regretted having to replace the British financial adviser, but it seemed necessary to make a selection from outside of neighbouring countries, seeing that Great Britain and Russia had excluded each other from advisorships. The policy he held in view was to promote a strong and independent Persia with Great Britain as her best friend as formerly. He would prefer to raise a loan for constructive purposes from British sources, and desired to avoid disturbing the oil company in anyway. He wished to know, if His Majesty&apos;s Government would assist towards immediate money requirements.The Secretary of State replied [No. 425] to the above on 28th October that the programmes and promises of the Persian Government failed to be convincing. Money for the rehabilitation of Persia would have been forthcoming had the Anglo-Persian Convention been in force, with advisers to ensure its expenditure in the wisest manner, whereas the present proposal of the Persian Government was that we should continue to lend them money to be disposed of under the advice of persons of a nationality to which apparently the Government were disposed to transfer concessions which already belonged to us. It was inconceivable that British assistance could be given under such conditions.Unrest in Northern Persia. Telegraphing [No. 587] on 20th October, Mr. Bridgeman. sent the following:-Rebellion is still simmering in Khorassan. Mohammed Taqi&apos;s two supporters, Ismail and Mahmud, who began by promising allegiance to the Persian Government, after their leader&apos;s death seem to have altered their attitude. A quarrel between the two, however, has resulted in the deportation, of Ismail and the promise of Mahmud to obey the Government.Mahmud is alleged to have appealed for help against the capitalist class from Turkestan.- The Prime Minister states that the Russian frontier is well guarded, and does not seem to fear the incursion of the men who are believed to have appeared on the Russian railway in response to this appeal. The Prime Minister has ordered : the advance of the Government troops to Nishapur, and, pending the appointment of a Governor-General, has invited Shokat to go at once to Meshed as Acting-: Governor. ;
The Russian trade commissioners advanced 4,0007. in gold roubles and liras to Mahmud for the purchase of grain delivered to the Russians. It was reported on 11th October that the Russian consul had come to the frontier but could not proceed.POLAND.Poland and Revolution in Podolia. Mr. Max Muller telegraphed [No. 427] from Warsaw as follows on 31 st October :--  -An anti-Bolshevik insurrection has broken out in Podolia, and a number of former members of General Petlura&apos;s army, who were working on the land in Eastern Galicia, have crossed the frontier and joined the movement.I learn confidentially from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, in making representations on the subject, the Soviet Minister has professed to regard such incidents as inevitable, but in communiques which he has sent to foreign journals the movement is represented as a further Polish attack..The Polish Government has sent a commission of enquiry and is strengthening the frontier police.PORTUGAL.The Neio Government and the Situation, The following telegram [No. Ill] was sent from Lisbon by Sir Lancelot Carnegie on 26th October : The new Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for me yesterday and spoke at length about the recent revolution, which he said had had the force of public opinion behind it, the proof of which was that it had not met with any opposition. He gave me to understand that the Government intended to govern, for a time at all. events, without Parliament; which, die hoped, would be constitutionally dissolved. He lamented the recent assassinations for which he said the Government were in no way responsible ; their task was in fact rendered much more difficult by having to begin with this undeserved slur on them. Seven of the murderers who belonged to the Republican Guard were already in prison and search was being made for the rest. He assured me that the Government were not only determined, but were fully capable of maintaining order.His Excellency spoke in the same sense to my Spanish colleague ; and doubtless did so also to several other foreign representatives whom he saw after me.I feel little confidence that the situation here is as satisfactory as the Minister for Foreign Affairs made out.&apos; The Prime Minister is meeting with great difficulties in forming a Government as several of his Ministers have already resigned. It is said that the Portuguese navy is permeated with Bolshevism, and that the Republican Guard cannot be relied on. Both Portuguese and foreigners are very nervous and their only consolation is the presence of foreign ships of war.RUMANIA.Relations with Hungary.-Sec &quot; Czecho-Slovakia.&quot;RUSSIA.Starving Russia: Communication from M. Chicherin. On 2Sth October the following message [No. 7547] was sent from Moscow to Lord Curzon of Kedleston and M. Briand : Copie Ministre des Etats Unis Amerique pour Secretaire cPEtat Washington, aux Gouvernements de Grande Bretagne, France, Italie, Japon et Etats Unis d&apos;Amerique, le 28 octobre.D&apos;apres les renseignements do la presse occiclentale la conference des puissances a Bruxelles mit comrae condition a 1&apos;offre a la Rnssie de credits pour secourir les affames la reconnaissance par le Gouvernement russe des dettes des precedents -Gouvernements. Jusqna present le Gouvernement russe n&apos;a pas. ete avise des decisions de cette conference. Neanmoins devant les masses populaires affamees le Gouvernement russe a resolu de ne pas tenir compte des finesses de 1&apos;etiquette diplomatique et estime de son. devoir absolu de declarer immediatement son point de vue sur les decisions de Bruxelles. Le Premier Ministre anglais Lloyd George dans son discours du 16 aout an parlement britannique, [word missing] un dessein diabolique la proposition de profiter de la famine pour obliger la Russie- a reconnaitre les dettes tsaristes. Cela n&apos;a pas empeche la conference de Bruxelles, pleinement informee que les dimensions de la famine ne permettent pas au 34-1 &apos; C
Gbuvernement sovietiste de sauver par ses propres moyens les populations sinistrees, de mettre la reconnaissance par le Gouvernement sovietiste des dettes anciennes comme condition a 1&apos;onverture de credits sans lesquels toute aide serieuse aux affames, est impossible.   En attirant 1&apos;attention des masses laborieuses de tous les pays cle tous les citoyens auxquels sont chers les interets cle riiumaniie sur cette conduite cle la conference cle Bruxelles, le Gouvernement russe declare en meme temps que la proposition de reconnaitre sous certaines conditions les anciennes dettes va actuelle-ment au devant de ses propres intentions.    Des le debut cle son existence le Gouvernement  sovietiste   se   proposa,   comme  un   des  principaux buts  de  sa politique, la collaboration economique avec les autres puissances.    11 a ton j burs declare son intention cle fonrnir un suffisant benefice aux capitalistes etraugers qui 1&apos;aideraient a mettre en peuvre les ricbesses natureiles cle la Russie et a retablir son appareil economique.   Actuellement il constate dans les declarations officielles et du President cle  la Republic  des   tats  Unis  et des Ministres anglais  la repetition  frequente cle  cette idee, que trois  ans  apres  la fin   de la guerre  mondiale il n&apos;y a pas  encore de prix veritable,  que la misere des masses populaires devient de plus en plus   aigue,  que les  dettes  publiques augmentent,  et que la mine saccroit.    II est absolument evident   qu&apos;il est impossible cle penser a retablir la paix complete sans la Russie avec ses 130,000,000 cPhabitants qu&apos;il est impossible de triompher cle la mine sans relever la Russie, et que la question des relations cle la Russie avec les autres pays etant un probleme mondial cle&apos; premiere importance ne pent etre resolue sans un accord avec le Gouvernement sovietiste.   Au point cle vue des interets durables et des besoins constants cle tous les Etats et de tons les peuples, la restauration economique de la Russie est une necessite absolue non seulement pour elle mais. aussi pour eux.   Or, 1&apos;absence de relations economiques avec les autres pays fait cle la renaissance economique cle la Russie une tache extremement difficile et clont 1&apos;accomplissement demandera periode beaucoup plus longue.   Le Gouvernement ouvrier et paysan est mieux place qu&apos;aucun autre pour executer cette tache.   Les interets egoistes de clivers groupes separes de capitalistes ne Pempechent pas cle travailler a restorer la prosperite nationale.   Linteret des masses populaires, qui est en dernier lieu celui de la socieie  meme,  guide  le  Gouvernement  ouvrier et pa3rsan.    En  se  proposant pour but l&apos;interet de tout le peuple  laborieux  cle  Russie,  le   Gouvernement ouvrier  et paysan, sorti victorieux des  epreuves  inoui.es de la guerre civile et Pintervention, ouvre a linitiative privee et au capital la voie de la collaboration .avec le pouvoir ouvrier paysan pour .1a mise en valeur des ricbesses natureiles de&apos; la Russie.    be  Gouvernement sovietiste a retabli le commerce prive,  la propriete pjrivee sur les petites entreprises, le droit cle concession, et de ferine sur les brandes.   Le Gouvernement sovietiste assure au capital etranger des garanties juridiques et une part suflisant benefice pour contenter ses intePets et Pameuer a prendre part an travail economique en Russie.   Dans cette voie le Gouvernenient sovietiste aspire a des accords economiques avec toutes les puissauces ce pour quoi il est en dernier lieu absolument indispensable qu&apos;une paix definitive soft conclue entre la Russie et les autres Etats.   En poursuivant ce but, le Gouvernement sovietiste se heurte a la demande faite par les puissances cle reconnaitre les clettes tsaristes.. Le &apos; Gouvernement sovietiste declare cpie selon sa ferme conviction aucnn peuple n&apos;est pas oblige cle payer le prix des cbaines qui lui ont ete imposees de longs siecles.   Mais clans sa decision inebranlable cParriver au plein accord avec les autres puissances le Gouvernement russe est dispose a consentir clans cette cpiestion plusieurs conces-sions essentielles et de premiere importance.   II va par la - au devant des desks cle multiples petite porteurs  cPemprunts russes,  particulierement en  France,  pour qui la reconnaissance des dettes tsaristes presente un interet essentiel.   Pour ces causes le Gouvernement russe se declare pret a reconnaitre les obligations a l&apos;egard des autres Etats et cle leurs citoj^ens, decoulant des emprunts cPEtat conclus  par le   Gouveniement  tsariste   avaut  mil  neuf   cent   quatorze   sous reserve expresse  cpi&apos;il  lui  soit  fait des  conditions  speciales   et   cle facilites. lui rendant possible la realisation de  cet engagement.    II va  cle soi  que la condition absolue de cette reconnaissance est que les grandes puissances prennent Pengagement simultane de mettre fin sans reserves -a tout acte  menacant  la securite des republiques sovietistes et de la republique extreme orientale amie, ainsi que leurs droits souverains et Pinviolabilite de leurs frontieres et cPobserver scrupnleusement le principe. de leur pleine souverainete et integrite territoriale. En cPautres termes la republique sovietiste ne peur prendre Pengagement en question que si les grandes puissances concluent avec elle une paix generale definitive et si son gouvernement est reconnu par les autres puissances. A cet effet le Gouvernement
russe propose cFurgence la convocation clune conference Internationale, pour traitor les questions ci-dessus, pour examiner les reclamations des puissances envers la Russie ainsi que cedes clu Gouvernement russe envers ces puissances, et pour elaborer entre eux un traite de paix definitive. Seule une conference de cette nature peut produire la pacification generale. Lors clu prochain quatrieme anniversaire de son existence la constatation s&apos;imposera universellement que les efforts de ses multiples ennemis iuterieurs et exterieurs out seulement servi a raftermir le Gouvernement ouvrier et paysan, comme le vrai clefenseur et representaut des interests des masses laborieuses de&apos; toute la Russie et de 1&apos;independance du pays. Les nouvelles interventions projeetes contre la Russie sovietiste et dont la realite est demontree par de nombreuses declarations cles organes dirigeants de la presse des pays ententistes rie feront que resserer encore cFavantage le lien indissoluble des masses laborieuses de Russie avec le Gouvernement ouvrier et paysan representant leur volonte mais la realisationde ces projets risque de prolonger les soutfrances&quot; des masses laborieuses et de retarder le retablissement complet de la Russie, en portant par la meine un coup aux interests de touts les aulres peuples. La proposition que fait le Gouvernement russe est la meilleure preuve de sa volonte de paix avec tous les Etatset de relations economiques . cme rien ne puisse troubler. La realisation de cette proposition repond a 1&apos;interet de &apos; tous les gouvernements et de tous les peuples. Le Gouvernement russe exprime le forme espoir, cette proposition sera suivie prochainement du reglement definitif des relations economiques et politiques entre la Russie et les autres Etats.SERBIA.Relations with Hungary.-See &quot; Czecho-Slovakia,&quot;SPAIN.Policy regarding Morocco. On 21st October Sir Esme Howard reported [No. 216] that the Cortes had reopened, and that the Prime Minister had made a short state-ment in both Houses ; in which in regard to Morocco he had expressed confidence in the policy of the High Commissioner, making it clear that the Prime Minister still held the view that the policy of holding the littoral and subsequent peaceful penetration was the oue to be followed.SWEDEN.Proposed Commercial Treaty with Russia. The following telegram [No. 160]&apos;was sent on 25th October from Stockholm by Mr. Barclay : The. Minister for Foreign Affairs told me to-day that negotiations were about to begin here for the conclusion of a commercial agreement with Soviet Russia. He wished this to be, if possible, on the lines of the British rather than on those of the Norwegian agreement. The negotiations would be in the hands of the Minister of Commerce and M. Kersjentseff.I asked his Excellency what would&apos;be the attitude of the Swedish Government if M. Litvinolf came to Stocldiolm. - Pie replied that they would raise no objection ; in fact, they had already given him a visa, but he was now on his.way to Moscow, so that it was not probable that he would, come here for some time.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The Treaty with Germany. On 19th October Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 686] from Washington that the treaty with Germany as ratified contained a provision to the effect that .the United States should not be represented on the Reparations Commission or on any other international agency without the express consent of Congress. - ,The American Forces on the Rhine. The following telegram [No. 710] was sent by Sir Auckland Geddes on 26th October : The Secretary of State informs me, in a memorandum received this morning, that&quot; the United States Government intend, on the proclamation of peace between the United States and Germany, to commence the gradual withdrawal of 126 officers and 7,873 men from the American forces on the Rhine. This movement will be completed by the middle of next March, at which time there will remain, subject to further consideration,&apos;one brigade of infantry and auxiliary troops totalling 372 officers and. 5,217 men.The United States Government believe that this step will prove of general benefit both in enabling Germany more easily to meet her recognized obligations and in contributing to the restoration of normal conditions in Europe.
