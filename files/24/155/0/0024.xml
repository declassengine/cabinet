FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ARABIA.King Hussein&apos;s Threatened Abdication [F.C.R., lxiii, p. 2]. Telegraphing [No. 181 on 24th February, Mr. Grafftey Smith reported that he was communicating Lord Curzon&apos;s message to King Hussein, who was due at Mecca on the following clay. He thought that the King expected the usual protests against his decision to abdicate, and that he did not intend to carry out his threat.Telegraphing again [No. 19] on 2nd March, Mr. Grafftey Smith further reported that King Hussein had without giving any warning left for Mecca that day. During his stay King Hussein had not acted as if were about to abdicate.AUSTRIA.Finance. On 3rd March Mr. Akers Douglas reported [No. 8] that the Chancellor had that day introduced the government proposals, which provided for : 1. A special commission to supervise the use of the credits, which are to be used exclusively to support the crown by the sale of foreign exchange and discounting bills.   The stabilization and reform of the note issue to be left till later.2. New taxes on alcohol..3. State enterprises, including railways and posts, to be taken out of the bureau-? cratic system and run commercially.4. Reduction of the civil service.   Bills for both purposes are in draft. ,:, .5. An internal loan for capital expenditure and unemployment.Mr. Akers Douglas added that Mr. Young had informed him that he regarded the progress so far made as quite satisfactory.CHINA.Amoy [F.C.R., lxiii, p. 3].  Telegraphing [No. 75] on 3rd March, Sir Beiiby Alston reported that after protracted negotiations locally, a partial settlement had been effected of the Amoy case and His Majesty&apos;s Consul was being notified officially of the effective cancellation of the boycott. Proposals for a comprehensive settlement of the foreshore question would be Submitted immediately by His M.ajes&apos;ty&apos;s Consul. The central Government had shown themselves powerless to help in the settlement, which had been arranged locally on the basis of the recommendations made by Mr. Clive after a visit to Amoy.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Agreement -with Jugoslavia. Sir George Clerk reported [No. 57] from Prague on 4th March that he had had an interview with the Prime Minister and had been informed by him that at his recent meeting with the Jugo-Slav Minister for Foreign Affairs at Bratislava, a complete agreement had been, reached in regard to a common policy towards Russia, the non-support of reactionary movements, readiness to establish commercial relations, and the recognition of the Italian claims to be heard in any question in the succession States involving direct Italian interests, with, however, an absolute refusal to admit Italian intervention in other questions.GERMANY.Financial Position. Lord cPAbernou telegraphed [No. 5G] as follows on 1st March : The financial position is getting steadily worse. The exchange on London is to-day 1,020 after 940 a week ago and 789 on 2nd January.The printing press continues to grind out notes. The total fiduciary issue in circulation to-day is 125 milliards as against 94 milliards on 1st October.
As already reported, the delegation of the reparation commission has. signed an ad referendum agreement with the German Government regarding deliveries in kind. The object and effect of this agreement will be to increase deliveries in kind by Germany. But as these deliveries have to be paid in notes to German producers the net effect on. the note circulation will be to increase the necessity for printing. This is admitted, by all authorities.In my opinion the whole basis of these exchanges is faulty. It is increasingly clear that devices for stimulating delivery in kind are at least 75 per cent, fallacy, and that their final result, (through intensified inflation) will be to aggravate, if not to accelerate, a catastrophe.The wise course is a full review of the real possibilities of the situation, either by the reparations commission or some other body, and the establishment of a workable scheme on the indispensable basis of a-stable currency.Personally, I regard this stable currency policy as the only sound solution, but opinion here in Government circles inclines more to the international loan alternative. Whether this latter is possible, whether it would solve the crisis or merely postpone it and transfer the loss may be doubtful.   But there can be no doubt about the extreme, urgency of rapid decision and action.Telegraphing again [No. 02] on 7th March Lord d&apos;abernon further reported as follows : The exchange continues &quot;to fall and is to-day 1,135 against 1,020 on 1st March. There is no panic but no (? resistance). The public appear to acquiesce mutely in conditions from, which recovery must be increasingly difficult and increasingly doubtful. The Ministry of Finance published a statement showing that the floating debt has increased by three milliards during the past week, the total expenditure of five milliards having been met as to two milliards from revenue and as to three milliards from an increasing (? subvention). The official notice adds that the increase of the floating debt is due mainly to the purchase of foreign exchange for reparations and the army of occupation charges and in a less degree to the deficit on railways and to increased allowances in respect of salaries.The total fiduciary issue is now 128 milliards as compared with .1.25 milliards on 1st March.The present level of exchange is approximately that of the lowest point touched in the November crisis. It was then considered a catastrophe ; to-day it is taken as a normal event without special importance and causing no surprise. This change is significant and in my opinion alar-ming.ITALY.The Political Crisis.-Oh 26th February Sir Ronald Graham telegraphed [Nos. 105, 106, .107] the following list of the Ministry which had been formed by Signor Facta :-Signor Facta - Premier, Interior, and (ad interim)the Liberated Territories. Signor Schanzer      -        -        .-   Foreign Affairs. Signor Amendola    - Colonies.Signor Luigi Rossi   - Justice.Signor Bertone       -        -        -   Finance. Signor Peano - Treasury.Prince Scalea ...   War.Signor De Vito        ...   Marine. Signor Anile - Education.Signor Riccio - Public Works.Signor Bertini        -...........   -        -   Agriculture.Signor Teofilo Rossi -        -        -   Industry and Commerce.Signor Dello Sbarba - - -   Labour.Duca di Cesaro       - Posts and Telegraphs.The new Ministry consisted of six democrats Signori Facta, Peano, de Vito, Amendola, Luigi Rossi, and Duca di Cesaro ; three catholics-Signori Bertone, Bertini, Anile; one liberal of the right Signor Riccio; one agrariau-Prince Scalea; one reformist socialist-Signor Dello Sbarba; two senators-Signori Schanzer and Teofilo Rossi, both liberals of the left when in the chamber.
The new Prime Minister had long been one of Signor GiolittPs closest adherents.. After being Under-Secretary of State to two Ministers of Justice, he was chosen bv Signor Giolitti to be his own Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of the Interior, where he served three years. He was Minister of Finance under Signor Giolitti from 1911. to 1914. Minister of Justice during the last six months of &quot;&quot;Signor Orlando&apos;s Government, and was Minister of Finance in Signer GiolittFs last Government from August .1920.Signor Facta, as the political, intimate of Signor Giolitti, was associated with the-latteFs opposition to italy&apos;s entry into the war, and took practically no part in politics from that moment till after the armistice. Like Signor Bertolini, the late Italian representative on the reparation commission, he was once attacked by the mob on account of his neutralist sympathies and supposed participation in Bulow-Giolitti intrigues. Personally he is very popular in the-chamber as he has an agreeable manner and much tact and shows great patience and good humour in dealing with bores and applicants for favours.By profession he is a lawyer and journalist, and his work in the chamber as Minister of Finance, member of the commission and reporter of various finance bills,, has given him some reputation as an authority on financial matters.He has never been considered a likely Premier, and even when he was sent for by the King no one thought he woidd be charged with the formation of a Government. He has always been regarded as a useful lieutenant. His close association with. Signer Giolitti may have prevented his being considered a possible Premier during the latteFs life-time. He is not a great linguist and has never appeared to interest himself in foreign affairs.Siguori Schanzer, Luigi Eossi, Peano, Riccio and De Vito are all old hands.. Signori Peano and De Vito were both civil servants, the former being Signor GiolittFs chef de cabinet and close confidant. He entered the chamber in 191.3 and was Minister of Public Works in Signor NittTs third and Signor GiolittFs last Ministry. Signor De Vito was Fuel Commissioner during the latter part of the war and Minister of Transport, in Signor NittFs first Cabinet. Signor Riccio was a well-known political journalist before becoming a deputy. He was Under-Secretary of State with Baron Sonnino and Minister under Signori Boselli and Orlando. He is vice-president of the Chamber. Signor Luigi Rossi is a well-known lawyer who has had experience-as Under-Secretary of State and twice as Minister of the Colonies.The three catholics are all new men and comparatively young. Signor Bertone was Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Finance, and Signor Bertini for Public Works, both in Signor GiolittFs last Cabinet. Signor Anile who has specialized in the educational question, was Under-Secretary of State of Public Instruction in the Boucmi Government.Prince Scalea has been three times Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, twice under Baron Sonnino and then with the Marchese di San Ciuliano. Signor Teofilo Rossi is a partner in the famous vermouth firm of Martini and Rossi, president of the Turin chamber of commerce and a devoted follower of Sigouri Giolitti. He was for long sindaco of Turin, but resigned.his office during the war after a speech defending Signor Giolitti against the attack made against him.The ablest new man and one of the ablest in the Cabinet is Signor Amendola. After making a name as a writer on philosophy and letters, he devoted himself to-journalism, first as Pome correspondent of Resto Del Uarlino and then as assistant to Signor Andrea Delia Torre in the Pome office of the Corriere dclla Sera. He succeeded Signor Torre when the latter left the Corriere, but nearly two years ago gave up his journalistic work to devote himself entirely to politics, lie played an important part in the movement to arrive at an understanding with the Jugo Slavs on the Adriatic question, and was secretary of the committee which promoted the Rome congress of oppressed nationalities and of the congress itself. He was Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Finance in Signor NittFs short-lived third Cabinet, and has made .a mark in the chamber both in committee and debate. It is said that Signor Facta chose him for the Ministry of War, but that the right raised an objection owing to his views on foreign policy.   Signor Amendola is not yet forty.Signor Dello Sbarba began political life as a socialist, but left the party with ,Signor Bissolati and became a reformist. Don Giovanni Colonna, Duca di Cesaro, has hitherto been known as one of the stormy petrels of the chamber. He was one of . the most active members of the league of national defence founded after Caporetto to-. oppose the defeatists. He has written much on political affairs, especially foreign politics, and, while he has at different times expressed himself in favour of Anglo-Italian co-operation, he is very suspicious of British policy in the Near East. He is one of the founders of the Institute Orientals in Rome.
Telegraphing again [No. IIS] on 2nd March Sir Ronald further reported that the Duca di Oesaro had resigned the Ministry of Posts and been succeeded by Signor Jvuigi Fulci, another democrat.   The incident, he added, was of small importance.Signor Tiitoni and the Genoa Conference. Sir Ronald Graham telegraphed [No. 1.18] as follows on 2nd March:-I met Signor Tittoni at lunch to-day and asked him whether it was true, as stated hi the press, that he would preside at the Genoa conference after Signor Facta had performed the opening ceremony. Pie replied that he had in fact been asked to do so. Signor Facta had insisted on it and had even made it a condition of assuming office, as he, Signor Facta, declared himself incompetent to undertake the presidency of the conference. But the whole arrangement had now fallen through, and it was probable that Signor Schanzer would preside at Genoa. Signor Tittoni spoke with some bitterness; and I have since learnt that it was Signor Giolitti whose interference upset the arrangement, as he endeavoured to interfere in the composition of the Italian delegation to work with Signor Tittoni. It is evident that Signor Facta consults Signor Giolitti on all occasions and is little more than his mouthpiece.Finvte. The following telegram [No. 123] was sent by Sir Ronald Graham on 5th March : The Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me this morning and I asked him how matters stood at Fiume. His Excellency assured me that the Italian Government intended to adhere rigorously to the treaty of Rapallo. lie had this morning summoned the prominent leaders of the fascist! and right parties and had informed them accordingly, impressing on them that if they encouraged the present violent movement they would be rendering a grave disservice to Italy. He trusted that the Commendatore Gastelli, with reinforced police, would shortly restore order.Representation at Tiflis [F.C.R., lxiii, p, 7]. Sir Ronald Graham reported [no number] on 21st February that the Minister of Foreign Affairs had informed him that the Italian Government had not, recognized the Georgian Government. The Italian representative at Tiflis had been allowed to carry on his duties there as he was already acting in his present capacity at the time when the actual Government was set up. In communicating this information the chef de cabinet added that the Italian representative had no real locus standi and was merely at Tiflis on sufferance.JAPAN.27ie Budget.-Telegraphing [No. 47] on 22nd February, Sir Charles Eliot reported that the budget, minus one small item, had passed the lower house on the 1.4th, after a prolonged debate and noisy scenes.Most of the opposition, he said, had refrained from voting. &apos; It had now gone to the upper house, where it was also being subjected to considerable criticism. The lower house was busy with legislative measures. A vote of non-confidence in the president of the lower house, in conuexion with the recent scenes in the chamber was rejected on the 16th. Army reduction had been the subject of considerable discussion in committee.   The agitation in favour of universal suffrage continued.JUGO-SLAVIA.Agreement with Czecho-Slovakia. See &quot; Czecho-Slovakia.&quot;PERSIA.Anglo-American Oil Negotiations [F.C.R., lxiii, p. 9].-On 20th February Sir Percy Loraine sent the following telegram [No. 118]: The Prime Minister told me this morning that he had sounded many deputies as regards the grant of a new concession for crude oil to British and American companies, and had convinced himself that it would be thrown out. He, therefore, maintained his previous opinion that the matter must be so arranged as to fit in with the Medjliss resolution of offering the concession to the Americans, and so to obviate any further refereuce to to the Medjliss at all.35-2     . B
I told His Highness that in my opinion he did not realize how far we had already gone in making the matter as easy as possible for the Persian Government, and in finding a burial formula for the vexed Khoshtaria concession. If the companies themselves were prepared to fall in with his views so much the better, but I personally doubted it and had thought it best to let him know, in a private friendly way, the broad terms on which, according to my information, the two companies were willing to take up the concession and work it; he could not expect, however, that either His Majesty&apos;s Government or I. could dictate those terms to the companies concerned, as that was a purely business matter of which they themselves were the ouly competent judges, and moreover the Persian Government had its own representatives in America through whom to make its point of view plain.I elicited the facts that Alai was only authorized to sign a document on the basis of the Medjliss resolution, and that Sinister was empowered to act as the Persian technical representative for the purpose of oil negotiations generally.Referring to the foregoiug, Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 126] on 26th February as follows: The Prime Minister sent me a message by Colonel Grey yesterday, from which I gathered that the Persian Minister at Washington has telegraphed the conditions of joint concessions and loan respecting northern oil, and that these are as reported in the geddes telegrams repeated to me, as I explained them to iYlushir-ed-Dowleh. His Highness expressed to Colonel Grey his concern mainly on two points: the preamble, and the right retained by the Standard Oil Company to withdraw from the whole business, and desired to ascertain whether I could intervene to secure a modification of these points, as he was certain that the Medjliss would not accept them. As Colonel Grey has been acting as unofficial adviser to Mushir-ed-Dowleh in the same way as to the ex-Prime Minister, I had anticipated this movement, and had already acquainted Colonel Grey fully with my point of view as already explained to the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of War, and as expressed in my telegram under reference. Colonel Grey was therefore able to speak to the point and did so. The Prime Minister nevertheless wished his message to be delivered to me, and I therefore requested Colonel Grey to inform His Highness that in my view the intervention which he suggested would be misplaced, and I could not undertake it, This morning the Military Attache saw the Minister of War, who told him that the Medjliss refuses the conditions, and will not permit the Government to touch the money advanced owing to British participation in the transaction. The Minister of War appeared profoundly dejected, and evidently had not made up his mind what, if any, steps to take. The Prime Minister told the Oriental Secretary, nevertheless, that the matter was discussed yesterday by the Medjliss in private session, and confirms the above account of the result, which lie attributes to fear of Russia. This is not the immediate work of Nosret-ed-Dowleh, who two days ago indicted accidentally on himself a severe gun shot wound in the arm, and is completely laid up.On the same date Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 127] that he had received confirmation of the above from the Prime Minister, who insisted that the fear of Russia was the sole reason for the opposition in the Medjliss to British participation. Sir Percy reported that the economic situation, apart from Government finances, was rapidly deteriorating in the northern provinces especially, and that a loan of some sort would become necessary. He also said that the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires was in substantial agreement with him as regarded the Anglo-American proposals.Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 64] on 28th February his approval of Sir Percy Loraine*s action as reported by him in his telegram [No. 126].Telegraphing [No. 128] on 28th February Sir Percy Loraine reported that after conversations with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice, he had concluded that the Russian threat bore a much graver aspect than he had imagined. . M. Rothstein had represented to the Persian Government more than once that Russia would not remain passive if the English were included in the northern concession. While both Ministers asserted that the Anglo-American co-operation was welcome in itself, they both sought a means of averting complications with Russia. They both also begged for an advance to enable the Government to tide over the difficulties accruing with the coming Persian.new year.In view of the probable resignation of the Government, should they fail to procure funds. Sir Percy asked if it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to authorize an advance under any circumstances until the question of the
northern oil concession had been determined.   He suggested the possibility of &apos;steps being taken with M. Krassin to remove Russian opposition.To the above Lord Curzon replied [No. 66] on 2nd March intimating his disbelief in the Russian threat exercising so complete a domination over the Persian Govern-meut, and explaining that no action could be taken in England to improve the. situation. Should the Persian Government come to a decision that the northern oil concession, for any reason, could not be settled on the lines indicated, Lord Curzon was not prepared to remove the embargo laid on a loan being made by the bank.Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 131] on 3rd March that he had received n pressing request from the Minister of Finance for an advance from the bank, and had declined to consider any such request unless it was made in an official communication which he could refer to bis Government, He proposed also to inform Mushir-el-Dowleh in writing that no modification of the proposals, as far as British interests were concerned, could, be contemplated; that no advance could bemade until the acceptance of these proposals ; and that no facilities could be given for any loan transactions if they were rejected.Telegraphing [No. 135] on 4th March Sir Percy recorded his impression, which1 he had communicated to the United States Charge cl&apos;Affaires, that the opposition to British participation in the concession was diminishing and that the real hindrance was the clause by which the Standard Oil Company reserved the light to withdraw from the whole concession. By a Washington telegram the Charge d&apos;Affaires had been authorized to explain that the withdrawal clause related solely to the event of the Standard Oil Company finding the concession an unsuitable proposition, and had communicated this to the Prime Minister. The latter had replied that he-thought that the concession might be granted on the basis of equal Anglo-American participation, provided that- the withdrawal clause were eliminated ; if it were retained the concession would be given nominally to the Standard Oil Company only.Sir Percy was inclined to regard this reply as indicating a more hopeful state of affairs, and was holding up his communication to the Prime Minister reported in his previous telegram.POLAND.Vilna. On 21st February Mr. Max Mailer reported [No. 41] from Warsaw that the Vilna Diet had unanimously adopted the resolution declaring the unconditional incorporation of the Vilna territory in Poland and calling on the Polish Diet to take the necessary steps without delay.RUMANIA.The Genoa Conference, -The following telegram [No. 23] was sent from Bucharest by Sir Henry Bering on 24th February : The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the Jugo-Slav Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs who return to Belgrade to-night have agreed with the Rumanian Government that before the. Genoa conference a preliminary meeting at Belgrade of financial and other experts of the two countries, together with those of Czecho-Slovakia and if possible Poland, would be useful. It is hoped that it may take place on 5th March.He is anxious there should be no misapprehension as to the object of this meeting which is in order to agree on the subjects affecting the countries of the Little Entente. They are agreed that the existing treaty should not be altered. They desire to maintain closest relations with Great Powers, but to be consulted ou matters especially affecting their own countries. They would be ready to assist in. relieving distress in Russia but will continue to be on their guard against Bolshevist pro-paganda. They are not planning anything against the Soviet Government. Especially the Rumanian Government would prefer to adjourn the Genoa conference owing to the general elections here during the period from the 1st to the 16th of March.   They have already enquired in Rome if the postponement would be possible.The Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that nothing was being plotted by the Little Entente against the Great Powers with whom loyal co-operation was intended, and that any press reports to the contrary were unfounded.38-2 c
RUSSIA..The Genoa Conference. The following telegram [No. oil] was received from M. Chicherin on 27th February : Ce n&apos;est pas sans etonnement, que le gouvernement russe presque a la veille du depart de sa delegation a apprit rajournement, sans qu&apos;une nouvelle date fut fixee de la conference Internationale. A. cette conference avec tout le serieux que reclamaient, les. motifs de sa convocation, tels qu&apos;ils etaient eloquement exposes clans le memorandum de M. Lloyd. George du quatre Janvier et qu&apos;ils semblaient avoir ete approuves par les autres participants cle la conference de Cannes, la republique de Russie avait clesigne une representation composee cles membres les plus autorises du pouvoir des Soviets, les enlevant aux fonctions gouvernementales les plus essentielles, appelant certains cVentre eux cles extremites cle la Ilussie et des republiques allies, depensant un labeur immense a preparer les materiaux necessaires pour permettre a la delegation de participer de la lucon la plus utile a la solution des problemes poses devant la conference. Le gouvernement russe s&apos;estimait en droit crattendre, que la decision, prise a Cannes par les premiers ministres apres conversations prealables et conciliation cles differents points de vue des participants a cette conference de Cannes, obligeant les uns envers les autres des pays representes par eux, ne serait pas subordonnee ensuite a des causes aussi accidentelles que le changement cle personnel de tel ou tel gouvernement. Le gouvernement russe considerait en outre le caractere urgent, reconnu par le memorandum de M. Lloyd George a la conference proposee par lui destinee a restaurer 1&apos;organisme economiqoe de 1&apos;Europe et la prosperite generale du monde entier et a mettre fin aux souffrances de dizaiues de millions cVhommes de tons les pays et par consequent l&apos;inadmissibilite de tout ajournement en une matiere comme la restauration de 1&apos;Europe. Le gouvernement russe etait habitue a entendre dire que les etats allies font tout particulierement cas de la fidelite ii leurs engagements, cle la Constance, et cle la fermenie en cette matiere des gouvernements avec lesquels ils entrent en accord. Or, des le lendernain de la decision de Cannes les changements survenus clans un des pays participants a cette conference mirent en dome la realisation de cette decision, et jusqua ce jour ebranlent la confiance que cette decision sera mise en application sous sa forme primitive. AujourcVhui la crise ministerielle d&apos;un autre pays aliie met en jeu le sort cle la conference prevue presque a la veille du depart de la delegation russe. Le gouvernement russe ne comptait pas se trouver en presence d&apos;une fragilite telle des relations politiques, que cles changements de personnel dans les gouvernements de tel ou tel pays, ne. modifiant cTailleurs en rien le fond cle leur politique, puissent influer sur les engagements internationaux pris devant tout 1&apos;univers par les puissances triomphatrices. Le credit, qui sera accorde a ces engagements, est encore d&apos;avantage detruit par les bruits simultanement repandus par la presse gouvernementale sans aucun dementi official sur cles moclifi-cations essentielles qui seraient aportees aux conditions de participation cle tels ou tels pays a la conference prevue. Pareilles tentatives, si elles se produisaient reellement, ne pourraieht que faire aparaitre comme derisoires le serieux et 1&apos;autorite cles decisions prises aux conferences internationales. Le gouvernement russe, en constatant les faits ci-dessus exposes, se permet clexprimer 1&apos;espoir que les gouvernements allies restant fideles a leur ordinaire prudence sauront, en fixant un nouveau terrne a la conference, attacher le prix qui convient aux con-siderations qui commandent de designer pour son siege un pays meme en dehors de la Russie sovietiste dont le gouvernement off re le maximum de garanties de dnrer afin cfeviter un nouveau retard pour causes fortuites. Absorbe par le serieux de la iutte contre la calamite cle la famine, qui frappe le pays, et contre les suites cles qnatre annees de guerre ruineuse, qui ont ete imposees sur la Russie, le gouvernement russe ne pent se permettre le luxe d&apos;arracher trop frequemment ses militants les plus autorises a leur travail pour attendre infructueusement les chaugeantes decisions cle gouvernements changeants. En consequence le gouvernement russe se permet d&apos;exprimer le desir, vu 1&apos;eloignement et la dispersion cle ses delegues d&apos;etre aviso au moins trois semaines cLavance cle la date definitive cle la conference. En ce qui le concerne, le gouvernement russe usant du droit, qui appartient a toute puissance invitee a la conference, propose comme date definitive pour Pouverture de la conference le vingt trois mars.Order to the Army and the Meet.-On 1st March Mr. Grove reported [No. 48] from Moscow that the press had that day published an order issued by M. Trotsky on 28th February to the Red army and fleet, warning them that owing to the postpone-
merit of the Genoa conference they could have no assurance regarding the safety of their frontiers, calling on all their energy in the work of the preparation of the armies, and reminding them that the inviolability of Soviet Russia depended on their might.SERBIA.The Exchange.-Sir Alban Young sent the following telegram [No. 29] from Belgrade on 1st March :.....-On account of the progressive diminution of the exchange, the Council of Ministers yesterday issued fresh regulations which in practice restrict all exchange transactions to the National Bank. The latter has no organization to deal with exchange business and the other banks are threatening to close down for a period. Amongst these regulations is one rendering it necessary for an importer to obtain, from a committee appointed for the purpose, a municipal permit for acqiusition, whether at the time of the order or for the time when payment becomes due, of the foreign exchange he requires for any particular importation. This permit will only be granted if the committee is satisfied that the importation of those particular goods is reasonable and necessary. I understand the object of this regulation is to restrict importations as much as possible. It is said that the committee will not get to work for a fortnight, which would appear to entail the cessation of all import business during this interval.SPAIN.New Cabinet. On 7th March Sir Esme Howard telegraphed [No. 31] as follows : Ever since the opening of the Cortes on 1st March rumours have been eircu-lated respecting the approaching Government crisis, and this morning the Prime Minister handed in the resignation of the whole Cabinet on the ground that Count Romanes had withdrawn from the Government his support and the two Ministers belonging to his party. It is not yet clear what was the reason for Count Romanes&apos; action ; but the probable motive is the refusal of the Prime Minister to re-establish constitutional guarantees except under the conditional passage of a law giving the Government exceptional powers in cases of emergency.On the following day Sir Esme further reported [No. 34] that the press had -announced the formation of new Ministry as follows : Seilor Sanchez Guerra -        -        -   President.Senor Prida       - State.Seiior Pinies       - Interior.Seiior Bergamin  - - - -   Finance.Seiior Bertran Musitu - Grace and Justice.Senor Arguelles   - Public Works.Senor Silio ....   Education.Seiior Calderon        &apos; -        -        -   Labour.General Olaguer - War.Senor Ordonez    - Marine.SWEDEN.Trade Agreement with Russia. On 2nd March Mr. Barclay reported [No. 24] that the provisional trade agreement with Russia had been signed on the 1st, It did not, however, come into force until approved by the Riksdag to which it would be-submitted in the course of the next few days.TURKEY.M.ustapha Kemal. On 4th March Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 134] as follows: Mustapha Kemal was re-elected president of the grand national assembly on 1st March.   In his speech on this occasion he made the following points : The foreign policy of the nationalists consists in being friends with those who accept the national pact, The nationalists desire to strengthen the bonds of friend-ship with the Russian Soviet republic, which had been the first to recognize the
liberty and independence of Turkey.   This principle would hot, however, impede the establishment or re-establishment of relations with States which should recognize-the complete independence of Turkey.   Relations of perfect friendship exist with the eastern States.Mustapha Kemal stated that Constantinople represented the goal of all the sacrifices of the Turkish nation ; it had. a particular importance for Turks and its preservation from attack was provided for in the national pact.He paid, a tribute to the peasantry, who, he declared, were the real masters of: Turkey and who had been unjustly oppressed in the past. These remarks were obviously designed to conciliate the bulk of the- members of the national assembly.. Mustapha Kemal, whilst claiming complete judicial and financial independence,, admitted that Turkish justice must be brought up to the level of that of other countries. As to finances he said that the financial resources of the Angora Government were sufficient to last until the attainment of the Turkish nationalist ideals without having recourse to a foreign loan.The Angora Mission. Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 120] on 25th February to the following effect. Hamid Bey, one of the deputies for Constantinople, will accompany Yussuf.Kemal to the allied capitals. This has been arranged by the. Kemalists on account of the refusal of the central. Government to authorize Yussuf&apos; Kemal to act in their name. Sir Horace said that he had learnt from a reliable source that the French High Commissioner had urged the Turkish Government to allow Yussuf Kemal to act for them, but the central Government had refused, feeling that if the Angora mission were successful the whole nation would benefit, and il it failed they would be free to make another attempt on their own part.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The &quot;Irish Republic.&quot; Sir Auckland Geddes sent the following telegram [No. 104] on 1st March :-His Majesty&apos;s consul-General at New York has obtained from one of his colleagues a copy of a circular letter sent out by Joseph Connolly, as Irish consul,., to the foreign representatives in New York, stating that the Irish Government is preparing to take over the full duties of its own consular services, asking for information regarding consular instructions, and fees, and for copies of the forms in use, in order to ensure that the Irish consular regulations shall conform to those of other Governments.Mr. Armstrong has also received an application lor a British passport from Mr. Thomas D. 0&apos;Connor, a member of the so-called diplomatic mission of the republic of Ireland to the United States.
