FOREIGN COUNTRIES REPORT.ARABIA.Publication of Official Correspondence. The acting agent at Jeddah telegraphed [No. 12] as follows on 5th February : Evidence of King Hussein&apos;s bitterness is seen in the publication by the Qibleh of official correspondence from this agency nominally obtained from a &quot; reader in Jeddah&quot; (invented (? group undecypherable)), e.g., His Majesty&apos;s Governments communication of February 1918, and their message of July 1918, sent to King Hussein as strictly confidential, deprecating any provocative action by the King or by Ibn Saud.Both are pungently commented upon in the light of later developments ; and in the latter case the mischievous suggestion is made that disunion in Arabia is the British aim, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government give Ibn Saud sufficient encouragement to ensure this.I am protesting against the abuse of &quot;official correspondence and the tone permitted to the comment; but I anticipate little result beyond a homily on the freedom of the press and a reference to The Times article.King Hussein&apos;s acts have long ceased to conform with his formal protestations of friendship and1 sincerity.King Hussein&apos;s threatened Abdication. On 20th February Mr. Grafftey-Smith reported [No. 16] from Jeddah that King Hussein had asked him, to remind Lord &apos; Curzon of his desire to abdicate on 27th February.He continued : He is coming t,q., Jeddah-during thenpxt few days. Bluffing or-not, he will certainly ask me to take note formally of his abdication, and general assurances in soothing terms, will be of little, use :in reply. The finances of the. country are very bad and I think the King is fairly desperate.He considers himself personally indispensable to us and trades on that. I would deprecate a reply merely confirming him in this belief without the backing of material concessions.If he is not pressed for ai reconsideration, of the decision, three things are; possible: he may say no more about abdicating and carry on as at present, more antagonistic because more, desperate than- ever ;- or he may announce.his-abdication publicly and still remain in Mecca, of all eventualities the most disastrous ; or he may abdicate and accept a jjassfege to Egypt in one of His Majesty&apos;s ships, certainly the best course for the welfare of Hejaz.On the following day Lord Curzon instructed [No, 6] Mr. Grafftey-Smjth to inform King Hussein that a note had been taken of his decision to resign on 27th February, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government, mindful of his loyal co-operation during the war and of their cordial relations with His Majesty during the last six years, regretted that he should find it necessary to take this step, but realized that it was a matter which King Hussein must settle with his own people.King Hussein and Ibn Saud. On 13th February the acting agent at Jeddah repeated [No. 15] to the Foreign Office the following telegram which he had sent to Baghdad: King Hussein complains of Ibn Saud&apos;s steady propaganda, religious and political, through Hail amongst the tribes to the north aud to the east of Medina. He chooses to assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government can, but will not, stop this.His fear is of a cut through. Alula to VVejh. Medina reports suggest that the complaints have at least some justification.Can I assure him that you will raise the question with ibn Saud ?BALTIC STATES.Political Prisoners in Lithuania. On 20th February Mr. Wilton telegraphed [No. 16] from Riga as follows : The Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me on the initiative of the Prime Minister that the Government had decided on the amnesty of nine Polish political prisoners on the occasion of the national holiday of 16 th February,.
In reply to my enquiry he assured me that the Cabinet dared not release, the remaining six who are.;; &quot;under- life sentence. He1 promised he would&apos; recommend the-&apos;Cabinet&apos;to release&apos;these:oh the occasion of the adoption of the&apos; hew: constitution which is now- being debated&quot; in &apos;the Assembly. He&apos; thought that might be in&apos;about two months&apos;time.BELGIUM:Draft of Agreement proposed by Belgium^ On 9th February Sir George Grahame telegraphed [No. 26] the terms proposed by Belgium for the agreement with, England: Considerant que le territoire beige, place entreTAllemagne et la France, se trouve dans une situatipn geographique particulierement exposee, qu&apos;au debut d&apos;aout 19.14 VAllemagne, clans le but d&apos;attaquer la France a envahi la Belgique au mepris d&apos;un traito qui 1&apos;obligea.it a respecter son territoire et que la Belgique souffre encore profondement cles devastations causees par 1&apos;invasion et 1&apos;ocoupation ennemies.Consid,erant. que la Belgique est decidee, comme en 1914,. a s&apos;opposer a une agression allemande par tous les, mpyens en son pouvoir et a ne conelure aucun accord -ou arrangement en contradiction avec cette determination cle defendre, son territoire.Sa Majeste Britannique et Sa Majeste le Roi cles. Beiges, etc.   ...   , se sont mis d&apos;accord. sur ce qui suit:ARTICLE I.Dans le cas dune attaque non provoquee de 1&apos;Allemagne contre le terfitoire de la Belgique, la Grande Bretagne viendra immediatement au secours de celle-ci avec toutes ses forces na vales, mihtaires et aeriennes.Article II.La Belgique emploiera toutes ses forces militaires, navales et aeriennes pour defendre ses frontieres en, cas cbattaque ou cle violation cle territoire par 1&apos;Allemagne.-Article III.Le present traite nimposera aucune obligation a l&apos;un quelconque cles Dominions -de 1&apos;Einpire britannique tant qu&apos;il. n&apos;aura pas ete approuve par le Dominion interesse.Article IV.Ce traite sera maintenu en vigueur pendant une periode cle trente ans, et, en cas -d&apos;accord cles deux parties, il sera renouvele a 1&apos;expiration cle cette periode.CHINA.The Customs Treaty.-The following circular telegram [No. 4] was sent to His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the United States of America, Belgium, France (by bag), Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal on 14th February: His Majesty&apos;s Government think it very important that the chief delegates of the special conference to be set up in accordance with the China customs treaty should be the heads of the respective diplomatic missions at Peking assisted by technical advisers. Even apart from the political issues involved, which are in any case of predominant importance, the present situation in China is such that any step should&apos; be avoided which might&apos;impair the. authority and prestige of the diplomatic body&apos; at Peking, Such a tendency-is already observable as an unavoidable result of the Washington conference.His Majesty&apos;s Government are, therefore, appointing Sir Beilby Alston, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, as chief British delegate. You should inform the &quot;Government to which you are accredited of the appointment and of the reasons therefor, and urge upon them the desirability of making a similar appointment.The Boycott. Sir Beilby Alston reported [No. 60] on 17th February that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was at last showing signs of real anxiety to end the boycott and had promised to telegraph urgently to all ports, where the boycott has had effect, to call it off.
^&quot;From what Mr.-Glive had told him, however, the authority of the central Govern-meht in Amoy was practically nil and they would have to mainly depend on a settlement locally. He, Sir Beilby Alston, was doing the utmost to get this arranged, through His Majesty&apos;s consul before the strike of seamen at Hong Kong had ended0International Control. On 20th February Sir Auckland Geddes repeated [No. 7G] the following telegram which he had received from Peking on 25th January : (1) The Chinese attitude vis-a-vis international control amounts to far more than disinclination.All their energies have been directed to utilizing the disappearance of the Russian-Government as a means to asserting their own claims to the supreme control of the-only surviving member of the Russian-Chinese partnership pending the re-appearance-of a Russian Government recognized by China.(2) China in her relations with the Soviet Government has been always guided; by two factors : (a) The necessity for keeping on terms with any de facto Russian Government inview of the enormous extent of undefended frontiers.(b) Improvement of the attitude of other Powers, particularly Great Britain,.&apos;towards the Soviet Government.China is not interested in any policy of acting as trustee of Russian interests, but see only their own advantage in the recovery of sovereign rights and the levying of&apos; large squeezes for their own officials.As regards the American proposals :  (I) The Chinese claim that this has been already effected by the agreement of 1920,. under which they have not only proceeded to oust Russian control over the lines, but are also assuming the control formerly (? exercised) by the railway in the adminis-tration of the railway zone.(2) This organization has been altered out of all recognition under the agreement of (? 1920), and the proposal to assign technical control to a Russo-Chinese organization, either in its original or present form, is the subject of the proposal put forward by Stevens and supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government (? on the) principle (that) the powers of the technical board should be increased so as to give them complete technical and financial control.(3) In the meantime control wordd presumably amount in effect to the control of&apos; the muuicipal administration in the railway zone, including the town of Harbin with its foreign population of over 200,000.   The Chinese will oppose this even more bitterly than the control of the railway itself.   It is difficult to imagine any foreign Power being willing to share in such a responsibility.(4) The only use that can be made of non-technical foreigners is in continuance of foreign representation in the Harbin municipality on the lines of the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1914, to which it is essential that the United States should adhere pending the constitution of a recognized (? Russian Government) with which the surrender of the political rights attaching to the railway can be negotiated with the Chinese Government in due course.(5) The creation of an efficient police force is an admitted necessity, but the only; chance of attaining it is by negotiating for it with the Chinese Government apart from., the control of the railway.To sum up, the Chinese will regard any attempt to obtain international control as tantamount to differentiating between Manchurian and Chinese property, and further to differentiating between northern and southern Manchuria and there is no hope of obtaining their agreement. Moreover, the status quo ante depends for success on the -assumption that a foreign loan will be necessary for the maintenance of the line. The only practical method of giving effect to the policy of preserving the line intact in trust for a reconstituted Russia is to adhere to the lines of the scheme as originally-submitted by the United States Government to the Japanese and ourselves and approved in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the addition of a provisiou to deal with the municipal situation at Harbin which has since become urgent. This would imply: (a) Increased powers of the present technical board in technical and financial.matters.(b) A consortium loan unless foreign Governments&apos; debts can be recoveredforthwith.
(^Organization of an effective Chinese police as. a question apart from thecontrol of the railway. .(d) An arrangement for the maintenance of the administrative control of Harbinwith foreign representation.I have read this telegram to the United States Minister, who informs me that he lias already approached the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the American proposals and found him &apos;; inhospitable.&quot;The Japanese Minister has not mentioned the matter either to the United States Minister or myself.- FINLAND.Relations v;kh the Bolsheviks [F.C.R., lxi, p. 4]. On 9th February Mr. Rennie telegraphed [No. 33] from Helsingfors as follows : In reply to one received from the Soviet Government, the Finnish Government have sent a note, dated 7th February, stating that they will agree to the formation of a mixed commission composed of four members to be chosen equally by Russia and Finland, provided that it is charged with the examination of the Karelian question from the point of view of the Dorpat treaty and at the same time of any remarks which the Soviet Government wish to make in this connection with regard to the attitude of the Finnish Government.The Finnish Government consider that the investigation would be best carried out under the auspices of the League of Nations, but if the Russian Government prefer another arrangement, e.g., the institution of a mixed commission, composed of subjects of neutral countries, the Finnish Government is disposed to take such a plan into consideration.GREECE.Situation in Asia Elinor. Mr. Lindley telegraphed. [No. 39] as follows from Athens on 7th February : The Russian Minister had a long conversation yesterday with the King, who told him that it was impossible for the Greeks to stand the financial strain of the occupation of Asia Minor much longer. If the question was not settled promptly he would withdraw his troops and concentrate in Thrace, which he could hold without difficulty.My impression is that, in the last resort, the Greeks would be unwilling to leave the Christian population to their fate; and the numbers of that population are so great that it is difficult to believe that the Greeks could evacuate them or dispose of them when evacuated. It. is nevertheless possible that the Greeks will be forced by the financial situation to evacuate, and His Majesty^ Government have no doubt considered the reaction of such evacuation on our position in Constantinople (one group undecipherable).ITALY.The Political Crisis. The following telegram [No. 53] was sent from Rome by Sir Ronald Graham on 8th February : , Signor De Nicola&apos;s failure is said to be clue to the action of the representatives of the democratic party interviewed by him. These are alleged to have reported to their group that the demands of the catholics for three portfolios and five uncler-secretaryships were iu the nature of an ultimatum, while the latter declared their attitude was deliberately misinterpreted with a view to rendering the formation, of a De Nicola Ministry impossible.Signer Orlando has now been requested to form a Government, but it is not -thought likely that he will succeed.In view of Signor De NicolVs failure it is considered that the crisis may be of some duration and there is an impression that only Signor Giolitti can form a Government, though it is difficult to see how he can gain the necessary support-of the catholics without a reversal of his present attitude, which is not favourable to their pretensions.37-4 B
-Telegraphing again [No. 60] on the following day, Sir Ronald further reported that Signor Orlando&apos;s failure was due to the insistence of the catholic party on their right to nominate candidates for three portfolios, which he would not accept in view of the deadlock, the catholic and democratic parties were holding a meeting in the hope of reaching some understanding which will render the formation of a Government possible. It was believed that Signor De Nicola had refused to-reconsider his decision, and failing some satisfactory solution of the discussions: between catholics and clemocratics the King must request Signor Bonomi to carry on the administration for the present.The only alternative seemed to be the dissolution of Parliament and the holding of a general election, but such a prospect was in general disfavour.Next day he telegraphed [No. 61] that the King had refused to accept Signor Bonomi&apos;s resignation and that the latter would make a declaration at the reopening of Parliament on 16th February. It appeared that the Cabinet would remain unchanged for the present.On the 10th he still further reported [No. 62] that it was definitely announced that Signor Bonomi&apos;s Cabinet would remain unchanged. At the moment it Avas believed that the vote on the Government declarations would be unfavourable as various (? democratic) leaders had expressed a resolve to continue their opposition to the present Premier. In that case it is thought that Signor De Nicola might succeed .in forming a Ministry on the basis of the agreement reached last night at a meeting of representatives of the popular and democratic parties.On 16th February Sir Ronald reported [Nos. 76 and 77] as follows :  The President of the Council at the reopening of the Chamber made a speech defending the Governments policy. After referring to the measures taken to suppress the disorders he drew attention to the prospects of improved relations betAveen employers and employed and the reduction of the deficit. He defended the attitude of the Government Avith regard to the failure of the Banca di Sconto, and turning to-foreign affairs alluded to Italy&apos;s part in the various conferences at Paris, Washington and Cannes. He asserted their firm intention to carry out the preparations for the Genoa conference on the date fixed.He concluded his speech by stating that the present coalition Government had never favoured any particular party, and referring to the Governments attitude on the death of the Pope, emphasised their recognition of the spiritual liberty of the-Church.Signor&apos;s Bonomts declaration had been coldly received by all sections of the chamber except the catholics. It did not look as if the Government would survive; the week.Next clay he reported [No. 80] that the Government had fallen, and on the 18th as follows [No. 81]: The Government Avas defeated by 295 votes to 107. This large majority against them was clue to the fact that they only received support from the catholics and the reformists. Signor Nitti and a few independents also voted for them. A manoeuvre was initiated by the reformist socialist Signor Celli, who put forward a motion to-commit the Chamber definitely to a declaration in favour of a Government based definitely on the left. This was supported by the socialists, but Avas defeated by a. skilful speech of Signor Mussolini, the leader of the Fascisti, avIio maintained that the essential point of Signor Celli&apos;s motion would be accepted by the Avhole Chamber;. but a second motion was carried expressing a lack of confidence in the Government on the ground that their policy did not ensure the carrying into effect of Signor Ceili&apos;s programme. As a result the vote Avas deprived of any significance as an indication of the feelings of the Chamber as regards the formation of aneAv ministry and the political situation remains in complete confusion.Signor Bonomi gave his resignation to the King this morning and it will be announced in the chamber this afternoon.Two days later he telegraphed [No. 85] again : The outcome of the ministerial crisis still remains obscure. Yesterday the King-received the. ex-premiers Signori Boselli, Salandra, and Orlando, and completed conversations with the presidents and vice-presidents of the senate and the chamber. This morning he has received the ex-premiers Signori Nitti and Sonnino, aud Signer Mussolini, the leader of the Fatecisti.   The formal consultations should be completed
this afternoon. It is reported that Signor Giolitti will he sent for, and his supporters insist that he will succeed in forming a Cabinet. This, seems quite, uncertain,, and the names of Signori Orlando, and De -Nicola are also freeiy quoted. There is strong opposition to Signor , Orlando, and a meeting of the catholics yesterday expressed their preference in the following order, De Nicola, Boiiomi, Orlando. .,Representation at Tiflis-Qn 17th February Lord Curzon instructed [No. 52] Sir Ronald Graham to enquire of the Italian Government whether they had accorded any form of recognition to the present. Soviet Governments of the trans caucasian States,, and if not, under what conditions an Italian representative had been accepted at Titlis. Lord. Cuvzon added that he had been informed, through Moscow, that the Georgian Soviet Government would not accept a British economic mission to the. Caucasus until they had been granted &quot; de jure &quot; recognition.JAPAN.The Washington Gohfereiiee.. The following telegram [No. 29] was sent to Sir Charles Eliot from the Foreign Office on 10th February: -We whole-heartedly share the satisfaction expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the results of the Washington conference, to the success of which Japan has so largely contributed, especially in the matter of Shantung. As a matter of fact Japan, while apparently making greater , concessions, has probably gained in reality more than any other Power from the conference, but this in no way detracts from our appreciation of the high qualities of statesmanship which she has displayed.As regards the reference to Kiaochow and Weihaiwei there is not, in our view, any parallel between the two cases. Kiaochow was not leased from China, but was captured from the Germans by Japan, who had demanded its surrender &quot; with a view to its eventual restoration to China.&quot; Japan has therefore been under a pledge to restore Kiaochow to China. Weihaiwei was leased to His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; for so long a period as Port Arthur shall remain in the occupation of Russia;&quot; and Japan, having at a later date replaced Russia as the lessee of Port Arthur and Talienwan, she was held to have been substituted for Russia in our lease agreement.. Weihaiwei therefore corresponds to Port Arthur and not to Kiaochow.Telegraphing [No. 37] on 15th February Sir Charles Eliot said : The Washington conference has been the subject of further discussion in the diet.. The general public show no enthusiasm for the results of the conference, but there have been no public manifestations of animosity. Motions by the nationalist and ministerialist parties for the reduction of the army were discussed in the lower house on the 7th and referred back to the committee.The ministerialist motion contained no concrete proposal, but the nationalist advocated the reducing the number of divisions by one-half and service in the infantry to one year. The Minister of War said that proper training in one year was impossible and deferred his answer with regard to reductionThe opposition parties have introduced a motion in the lower house advocating universal suffrage and a demonstration in favour of it took place here on the 11th.. The demand is popular, but its refusal is not. likely to cause trouble.Some disturbances occurred after the demonstration, but they were not serious -and. are believed to have been deliberately arranged by politicians.The Four-Poioer Treaty. On 17th February Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 32] to Sir Charles Eliot as follows: -Mr. Balfour informed the Italian delegate generally on 27th December of the objections to the inclusion of Italy in the four-Power treaty, pointing out, moreover, that it was not a treaty between four principal, allied and associated Powers as such, but merely a treaty between four of them which happened to have territorial possessions in the Pacific. We subsequently informed the Italian Ambassador here that the decision not to include Italy being that of the Washington conference, if the Italian Government wished to re-open the question His Majesty&apos;s Government thought that they should in the first instance approach the State Department at Washington, The Italian embassy now inform us that the United States Government have stated verbally that they would have agreed if the other Powers;, and especially Great: Britain and Japan, had agreed. The Italian Government accordingly renew their request for admission.37-4 c
His Majesty&apos;s Government would now propose to reply to the Italian Government on the lines of the answer already returned to the Italian delegate by Mr. Balfour, hut before doing so would be glad to learn the views of the Japanese Government.. It should, of course, be made clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of shifting the responsibility of their share in this decision on to the shoulders of the Japanese Government.In reply to this Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 45] on 20th February that he had,, that afternoon spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had expressed his thanks and said that he entirely approved of the proposed reply to the Italian Government, and that he would make a similar reply. He also said that the Italian ambassador had called on him about 10 days ago and made a communi-cation resembling that reported in Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram. He had discouraged the ambassadors proposals and pointed out that Italy had. no territorial interests in the Pacific or Eastern Asia.He had instructed the Japanese ambassador at Washington to see Mr. Hughes on the matter, and Mr. Hughes had informed him that the Italian statement was an exaggeration. He had told the Italian ambassador at Washington that the United States could not take up the question of including Italy, because Great Britain and Japan had opposed it at the conference. On being further pressed he had said that if Great Britain and Japan spontaneously requested that the decision might be reversed, he did not suppose that the United States would raise any objection.PERSIA.Uebellion at Tabriz.-Telegraphing [No. 85] on 7th February Sir Percy Loraine reported that the Minister of War had informed him that the Tabriz coup was carried out with the complicity of the Swedish gendarmerie and Colonel Lundberg.On the same date Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 86] in continuation of the above as follows : The Minister of War has information that events at Tabriz are taking on a revolutionary complexion, that red flags are appearing and the ShalFs portraits being destroyed.I hear that Legrand, the Chief Commissar at Tiflis of the Moscow Soviet Government, has arrived at Julfa. The last two telegrams from Lahuti Khan are signed &quot; President of Soldiers&apos; Council.&quot;Later on the same date Sir Percy sent the following telegram [No. 90]:-The Prime Minister informs me that he had issued a warning (as to British and other officials leaving Tabriz) because Government troops were now closing in on the town, and if the rebels did not yield an attack would be delivered. Lahuti, in the latest telegrams, had threatened that if Government troops continued to advance he would kill the Governor-General and other prisoners, and commit all (group omitted) unfspecified ?) acts of violence.As 1 am unable to communicate with Tabriz I asked the Prime Minister, to instruct the commander of the Government troops to endeavour to acquaint His Majesty&apos;s consul with the situation, to avoid bombardment of the European quarter,, and in any street fighting to render every possible assistance to Europeans.The following telegrams on the same subject were despatched by Sir Percy Loraine on. the dates specified : [No. 93.] 8th February. Telegraphic communication with Tabriz was restored, yesterday.The Prime Minister has given me written assurances that the Persian Govern-ment will take every possible step to protect the lives and the legitimate interests of British subjects if fighting occurs, and the Minister of War is sending the needful instructions to his commanders. If notwithstanding these precautions danger remains, His Highness thinks that the Persian Government should not be held responsible.I have since heard that Lahuti in telegraphing to the Persian Government actually threatened the lives of the foreign consuls if Government troops attacked the town.I am supporting the Persian Government in their resolution to end this insurrection and am using the influence of the legation aud consulate in the direction of. a settlement without bloodshed and based on au amnesty which would safeguard the authority of the Persian Government.
The French Minister is informed by his consul that elements of a Bolshevik -character have got the upper hand of the democrats in Tabriz and that the grain stocks are being sold out.[No. 94.] 9th February. After heavy firing yesterday the gendarmes gave in;&apos; some 300 (? inhabitants) are said to have fled north with Lahuti. Cossacks entered the town and did some looting, which was quickly stopped. The consul reports that--all Europeans and Americans are safe, also the Governor-General.[No. 95.] 10th February.   The position at noon to-day.The town, is quiet; the military are still in charge; the destination of the-fugitive gendarmes is uncertain, they were accompanied by the bulk of the Caucasian Bolshevik element who had joined the insurrectionary movement; all telegraph lines to the north have been cut. No damage to British or Italian subjects, but the bazaar and the houses of French nationals were looted as also two Bolshevik shops. The -Governor-General, whom the Persian Government will not reinstate, considers that the democrats and not the gendarmes were responsible for the trouble. The Minister -of War is much relieved, and will continue his operations against Simko, who seems not to have moved. The Persian Government wished to temporize and negotiate. The successful strong measures were due to the Minister of Wars personal initiative ; his troops suffered some 50 casualties in the sharp fighting. One of his best lieutenants, Habibullah Khan, was in command.[No. 102.]   11th February.   The following is from the consul, Tabriz: Westwail (sic) Khan, the officer commanding the Cossacks, has published a notice that the Prime- Minister has appointed him acting Governor-General until the arrival of the new Governor-General from Teheran.Three well-known democrats have been arrested as well as several Caucasian Bolsheviks. Lahuti Khan, with two of the worst Tabriz democrats, is said to have crossed the frontier into Caucasus, but the bulk of the rebel gendarmes are believed to be in Maraud.   The Persian telegraph to Julia is working.[No. 100.]   13tli February.   The following is from the consul, Tabriz : -I saw the acting Governor-General last night. He confirmed the report that Lahuti Khan with two democrats and 48 gendarmerie officers and men have crossed the frontier. The bulk of the gendarmes have surrendered, but some 150 are in the neighbourhood of Marancl ; 250 Cossacks have been sent to round them up.[No. 113.] Kith February. Mussacldiq-es-Sultaueh, Minister of Finance in the late Cabinet, has been appointed Governor-General at Tabriz.American Advisers. Telegraphing [No. 47] to Sir Auckland Geddes on 9th February, Lord Curzon informed him that it was within the knowledge of His Majesty&apos;s Government that endeavours were being made to engage advisers in the United States to guide Persian policy, particularly in administration and finance. This was looked upon with approval as the best chance of salvation for Persia. Provided the advisers selected were honest and competent and would act entirely in the interests of the Persian Government, and would maintain an attitude of even justice towards all foreign interests in Persia, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be disposed to accord them complete support.On 10th February Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed as follows : The United States Charge d&apos;Affaires tells me privately that, according to a telegram, just received from. Washington, the United States Government in general regard favourably the proposed. Anglo-American co-operation as regards the concessions and a loan. He infers that, his Government will abstain from action as regards the Persian Governments request, for American advisers, pending the satisfactory settlemeut of the above-mentioned questions.The Financial Situation [F.C.R., lx, p. 5]. The following telegram [No. .112]: was sent by Sir Percy Loraine on 15th February: I&apos;have just received a letter from the Prime Minister to the following effect:  The present financial situation compels me to request your temporary good offices as a personal service in authorizing the Imperial Bank of Persia to make a. Treasury operation with the Ministry of Finance. It would be necessary to make an immediate advance of 1  million tomans, the repayment of which will be settled between the Treasury and the bank on the Southern and Kermaushah customs.Please instruct me as regards reply.
In reply to the foregoing, the following telegram [No. 57] was despatched from Lord. Curzon to Sir Percy Loraine on 17th February :-1 understand from the A,uglo-. Persian Oil Company that all outstanding questions with the Standard Oil Company have now been overcome; and that documents, including those relating to the loan to the-Persian Government, would be signed on 16th February. The advance of $ 1,000,000--on this account should therefore be available at Teheran almost at once. It seems, therefore, unnecessary for Persia to have recourse to further borrowings from the-Imperial Bank of Persia as proposed.On 21st February Sir-Percy Lbraifle was further notified by telegram [No. 61] from the Foreign Office, as the result of information received. from Sir Auckland Geddes, that the sum of $1,000,000 was now available, and it was for the Persian Government to instruct the Persian Minister in Washington as to the transfer.PORTUGAL.- Revolution threatened. Sir Lancelot Carnegie telegraphed [No. 32] as follows from Lisbon on 20th February : Lisbon is threatened with another revolution, apparently of the same character as that of October last. The movement was to have taken place early yesterday morning, but military precautions were taken by the Government,, and so far all is quiet. The Government and the President have, however, left Lisbon and are how at Cascaes at the mouth of the ,Tagus. Additional troops have been brought up from the-provinces. The situation seems serious; but all depends on the attitude of the-army, which, is uncertain.On the following day Sir Lancelot further reported [No. 33] that all remained quiet. The situation seemed to be improving as part of the Republican Guard was reported to have surrendered their arms at the demand of the army, which so far was supporting the Government,   The latter had not, however, returned to Lisbon.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The President and ilve Treaties. On 10th February Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 57] that the President had that day presented the treaties to the Senate and strongly urged their ratification in a long speech ending with the following-words : I submit to the Senate that if we cannot join in making effective these covenants for peace and stamp this conference with America s approval, we shall discredit the influence of the Republic, render future efforts futile or unlikely, and write discourage-raent. when to-day the world is ready to accept new hope. Because of this feeling, because I. believe in the merits of these engagements, I submit them to the Senate with&apos;, every confidence that you will approve.THE VATICAN.Policy of Pius XL On 8th February Count de Salis telegraphed [No. 12] as follows:  The Pope has confirmed in his functions the former Cardinal Secretary of State Gasparri. The news of this appointment has been received with general satisfaction and is of course accepted as a clear indication that there is to be no change of the conciliatory policy hitherto pursued in the general interests of pacification. On the contrary, the gesture of the Pope in giving his first blessing from the outside of St. Peter&apos;s is interpreted to mean that that policy will be strengthened and developed. I believe there is no precedent for a Secretary of State holding office under twro-Popes. Minor appointments have been also re-confirmed to an extent which, is quite-exceptional.The Cardinal Secretary of State told me this morning that, on a second and more-peremptory expression of the Pope&apos;s wishes, he had agreed to remain on ; but his own idea was that it would only be for a year or so. He appeared to be suffering severely from the strain of the last three weeks.The French Protectorate in. the East-On lath February Count de Salis was instructed [No. 9] to make representations to the Vatican in regard to the general question of the.
