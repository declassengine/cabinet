FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ARABIA.King Hussein and the &quot;Treaty. On 15th January the acting agent at Jeddah transmitted [No. 3] the following message from King Hussein for His Majesty&apos;s Government: My respect for&apos;(? equal) rights and their fulfilment compels me to request His Majesty&apos;s Government to postpone their final decision about the articles of the Lawrence treaty till my son Abdullah reaches them and pending the perusal of my letters which he brings, with supplementary information and explanations given to him by me.The following instructions were telegraphed [No. 1] to Mr. Grafftey-Smith on 24th January: The following message dated 28th December has been telegraphed by King Hussein to the Prime Minister : To safeguard the interests which we consider to be our principal capital in this world against threatening vicissitudes, I thought it to be advisable to delegate my son Abdullah to have the honour of interviewing His Majesty the King and your Excellency as well, such doing prove, the predominating motive pf loyalty to principles. If your Excellency approve of. this, kindly notify Abdullah direct and myself through the ordinary channels.King Hussein&apos;s wishes had also been communicated by. the Emir Abdullah through Colonel Lawrence, but the visit of the former while the treaty remains unratifiecl would only encourage King Hussein&apos;s hope of securing eleventh hour modifications. ...        &apos;You should let it be known that revision of the treaty is out of the question and that it must be accepted or rejected as it stands.If King Hussein, however, after ratifying the treaty, has further points to.urge, he might take the opportunity of Emir Abclullah&apos;s visit, which must at present be regarded as postponed, to commission him to make the desired representations ,to His Majesty&apos;s Government.: BALTIC STATES.The Prime Minister of Lithuania. Mr. Dilley telegraphed [No. 4] as follows from Kovno on 13th January :  After the sitting of the Diet to-day, the people&apos;s socialist ,(? party omitted) recalled the Prime Minister from his post in the Cabinet owing to a difference ,of opinion on the land reform bill and also on the ground that the present Government was too clerical. This action was the result of a heated discussion in to-day&apos;s Jjiet, and has come as a surprise to everyone.The new Cabinet is expected to be formed next week, but no further information is as yet available.Latvia and russia. On 24th January Mr. Wilton reported [No. 6] from Riga that in conversation the day before the Minister for Foreign Affairs had related to lam the substance of his conversation with the Bolshevik representative on Friday last: According to the latter, the Bolshevik Government had been incensed at the reference to the League of Nations and declined all suggestion of mediation at present. He hinted that mediation which did not embrace internal interference with Russia might be possible later. The language of the Bolshevik representative was reasonable,- and he did not dispute that mediation on the basis of the Dorpat treaty need, not be regarded as internal interference. He indicated that the former demands would be moderated, and that the question of compensation would not be pressed.Mr. Wilton added that the Minister for Foreign Affairs thought that the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government at Moscow had had a good effect and that the prospect of a peaceful settlement was now more hopeful.
BELGIUM.The Prime Minister on. the Situation. The following telegram [Xo. 10] was sent by Sir George Grahame on 16th January : -&apos; The Belgian. Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs received a large party of Belgian, and foreign journalists yesterday. The Ministers had the cheery demeanour of bearers of good news and announced the excellent results for Belgium of the, Cannes Conference. They declared that priority was more assured than before; that German payments during 1922 were going to be larger than the first proposals made at the Supreme Council; that the Anglo-Belgian defensive agreement was complete and ready for submission to the Cabinet in both countries; that Belgium would go to the Genoa Conference, but with guarantees for the repayment of Belgian capital in other than State enterprises in Russia; and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had admitted the principle characterized as altruistic-of delay in the repayment and consolidation of the post-armistice Belgian debt of 15,000,000(1.CENTRAL AMERICA.The Federation [F.C.R., liii, p. 3]. -Mr. Lyall reported [No. 2] from Tegucigalpa on 16th January that the federation might be considered dead.    The&apos;Federal Congress had not met on the date fixed, and Guatemala was reported to have declared itself an independent nation.CHILE.. Tacna Arica [F.C.R., Ix, p. 2]. The following telegram [No. 6a] was sent from Santiago by Mr. Vaughan on 18th January :-The United States Ambassador yesterday asked the Chilean Government whether they would accept an invitation, if made officially, to send a representative to Washington to discuss with a Peruvian representative the basis of a settlement of the differences arising out of the, treaty of Aneon.The Peruvian Government is being similarly sounded. . [ -The Chilean press to-day reports fully the demarche of the United States Ambas-ambassador here, aud the fact that Chile has accepted.[See &quot;Peru.&quot;]CHINA.Salt. Sir Beilby Alston sent the following telegram [No. 20] from Peking on 18th January: The situation remaining unchanged, my colleagues and 1 addressed a further note to the Chinese Government to-day, warning them that unless immediate steps were taken to prevent interference with the central salt administration it would be necessary for the authorities of the Governments interested in the reorganization of the loan agreement of 1913 to devise means to deal with the situation themselves.Official information has since been received that, following the example of the navy, Wupeifu has given orders to detain the whole Hupei salt revenue for military purposes from to-day, and we (group undecypherable) supplemented our note by joint verbal representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom we warned of the seriousness of the situation.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Payment of British Debts. Mr. Cecil telegraphed [No. 16] from Prague on 19th January that the Prime Minister had shown him a copy of a draft bill which guaranteed payment of all British debts in that country contracted prior to 28th October 1918.This bill would receive the approval of the council of Ministers that afternoon and, if possible, come before Parliament this session, which would end on Thursday week. If this were impossible it would be introduced at the beginning of the spring session in April. The Prime Minister had assured him most emphatically that the bill would be passed within a fortnight.Dr. Benes saw no objection to those interested being informed at once that the Czecho-Slovak Government had decided to give this guarantee.
FINLAND.Relations with. Ike Bolsheviks [F.C.R., lx, p. 3]. On 14th January Mr. Reiiriie telegraphed [No. 19] as follows from Helsingfors : The Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated yesterday verhallv to the Bolshevik representative the reply of the Finnish Government to the various Russian demands, which is to the following effect: 1. The Finnish Government already on 28th December announced that all recruitment and sending of military assistance across the frontier was forbidden. Finnish citizens could, however, be punished for such action directed against a friendly State only when there were reciprocal arrangements between Finland and the State concerned.2. As regards the expulsion of the White Russians now resident in Finland and the dissolution of their secret organizations, the Finnish Government reserves to itself liberty of action, but the Russian Government can make any communication they may think necessary through diplomatic channels.3. The Finnish Government have declared that they will disarm and intern refugees from Karelia and have already acted on these lines in accordance with international usage. They cannot, however, admit the claim that the refugee Karelian chiefs must be expelled ; and the Finnish Government must be free to-decide which of such persons may enjoy the right of asylum in Finland and to which it will be refused. As regards the return of arms taken from refugees, this will be a subject for future negotiations.4. The Finnish Government will not be responsible for the costs of the expedition against Karelia, as this would be an admission of the responsibility of Finland for the rising.5. The Finnish Government cannot accept the proposal for a mixed commission to supervise the execution of orders given by the Finnish Government to protect their neutrality.The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that the tone of the Bolshevik representative yesterday was less uncompromising. He also heard last night from the Finnish Charge d&apos;affair.res at Moscow, whom he had instructed to communicate the above-mentioned reply in the most conciliatory manner, that the attitude of the Russian Foreign Office appeared to be, these last few days, much less stiff.[See &quot; Roland.&quot;]FRANCE.New Cabinet. On 15th January Lord Hardinge reported [No. 26] that the new cabinet was composed as follows : -M. Raymond Poincare - President of Council, Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Barthou          - - Vice-President of Council, Justice and Alsace-Lorraine.M. Maurice Maunoury - Interior.M. de Lasteyrie     - - Finance.M. Magiuot          - - War and Pensions.M. Raiberti          - - Marine.M. Cheron -         - - Agriculture.M. Alexandre Berard - Labour.M. Leon Berard     - - Public Instruction.M. Albert Sarraut - - Colonies.M. ie Trocquer      - - Public Works.M. Dior     -        - - Commerce.M. Reibel   -        - - Liberated Regions.GERMANY.Reparations.-Lord d&apos;abernon telegraphed [No. .1.1] on. 18th January that he understood from a usually well-informed source that the German Government was drafting a reply regarding reparations on the following lines : After a restatement of the general position similar to Herr Rathenau&apos;s speech at Cannes, it will point out that eighteen milliards of paper is the only surplus available
during 1922.   The German Government realize that this sum is insufficient to meet the reparation needs of the Allies. &apos; They propose, therefore :-&apos; (a) The flotation of a foreign loan to meet the cash requirements of the Allies. (6) The flotation of au internal loan to meet the sums due by the German Govern-ment to German nationals for deliveries in kind ; and further to meet the deficit on posts and railways.If the German Government can find a budget equilibrium as explained, and can meet treaty obligations and the extraordinary budget by loans, there will be no necessity to have recourse to the printing press. If, on the other hand, the allied Governments are not willing to accept this basis, and if some other system is insisted upon, Germany will have to resort to the printing of additional bank notes. The draft concludes with a request that Germany should be heard again in the event of the Entente not agreeing to the basis proposed. The above is, of course, subject to modification during the discussion with the different technical commissions, which have been called in to examine it.GREECE.Financial Situation. On 10th January Mr. Lindley reported [No. 19] that the acting Prime Minister, and. the Minister of Finance had informed him. confidentially that the Greek Government were at the end of their financial resources. They could not borrow further from the National Bank without a fresh issue of notes ; nor could they raise an internal loan without calling together the Chamber, which it was impossible to do until the return, of the Prime Minister. They had cut down their military expenses to lUO.000,000 drachmas a month and could do no more in that direction.   They desired peace most earnestly.Mr. Lindley added that, should the Greek Government fail to raise any money in London, he was of opinion that they would have recourse to the issue of paper in defiance of the financial commission. They had no other alternative. This would mean a heavy break in the exchange ; and the assignment of revenues would no longer suffice for the claims of the bondholders.Should Greece collapse financially, or should the Turks believe her collapse approaching, the latter would become, if possible, more intractable than they were now.PERSIA.Financial Negotiations [F.C.R., lx, p. 6], On Sth January Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 16] as follows.: -The United States Charge d&apos;Affaires tells me that, so far as he is aware, the action of the Persian Government as regards an advance from America is entirely unilateral. He considers it unlikely that the Standard Oil Company are providing the money, but it is possible that Mr. Morgan Sinister has arranged the advance privately with some American firm. Pie feels certain that the United States Government have not encouraged or countenanced any such transaction, but admits that it could be done independently of them.A further telegram [No. 22] was sent by Sir Percy on 12th January hi the following terms : I enquired of the Prime Minister by letter whether the Medjliss resolution respecting our advance implied the rupture of my.negotiations with him for a British advance on your four conditions. His Highness, after thanking me for my friendly frankness in consulting him, aud expressing an earnest desire to strengthen the ties between the two Governments, considers the American advance is justified by the present difficulties of the Persian Government, aud should not cause the rupture of our negotiations, which are &quot;compatible with the aspirations of. the country.&quot; He trusts that 1 shall share his view that as the Imperial Bank of Persia refuses any advance for pressing needs, and any British payment is subordinated to conditions which present great difficulties, the Persian Government has been compelled to apply to other quarters for its immediate requirements.His Highness will be surprised if the Persian Governments attempt to save the country from general disorganization creates au unfavourable impression in London,
and he relies on me to explain the present unsurmoiintable difficulties with which they are confronted.On 13th January Sir Percy sent the following telegram [No. 24]: Hearing that the Persian Government intend shortly to rush another resolution through the Medjliss for the engagement cf an adviser in the Ministries of Finance, of Agriculture, and of Mining and the Interior, I have written to the Prime Minister expressing the hope that the report is unfounded, as such action would modify the situation hitherto under discussion, and in my opinion make impossible the resumption of discussions &apos;for a British advance on the basis hitherto adopted.The Shah&apos;s Visit to Europe. On .15th January Sir Percy Loraine sent [No. 34] the following report:-The Shah yesterday issued a rescript announcing his departure .on 25th January for Europe via Baghdad, to undergo medical treatment, and promising to return in six mouths. Vali Ahd has been summoned from Paris as Regent,.and his oldest brother, Etezad-es-Sultaneh, jointly with the Prime Minister, is to carry on meanwhile, apparently subject to the reference of important matters to His Majesty.Telegraphing [No. 36] on the 16th.January, Sir Percy reported that he had been recpiested hy the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask the assistance of the Governor of Bombay and of the High Commissioner at Baghdad in providing facilities for the Shah&apos;s journey. The Shah intended to preserve a strict incognito, and his suite, after crossing the frontier, would consist of only four persons.As reported previously by him, Sir Percy called attention to the internal difficulties which might arise on the Shahs departure, and stated that native opinion anticipated trouble and disturbances.Resignation of the Government. Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 39] on 19th January that the Shah on the previous evening had accepted the resignation of the Government.PERU.Taena Arica. Mr. Grant Duff reported [No. 14] from Lima on 20th January.that the notes exchanged between the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires and the Peruvian Government had been published in the press of that day.The President of the United States was ready to welcome rejnesentatives of Peru and Chile at Washington, to arrange existing difficulties or to agree to the settlement, of them by arbitration.The Peruvian Government was prepared to send a representative to Washington on the undertaking that, if necessary, all the differences arising out of the treaty of Ancon should be in the last resort decided by arbitration arranged by the United States Government.[See &quot; Chile.&quot;]POLAND.Finland and Russia. -On 23rd January Mr. Max Midler reported [No. 19] from Warsaw that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the Polish offer of mediation had been courteously declined by M. Chicherin on the ground that the Soviet Giovernment could admit no foreign intervention in.their dispute with Finland. He had discussed the question at length with the Polish Charge d&apos;Affaires, who was able to urge the advantages of moderation.[See &quot;Finland.&quot;]RUMANIA.New Cabinet. Sir Herbert Dering reported [No. 10] on 18th January that the party of the late Prime Minister had introduced a vote of censure on the present Government in the Chamber, and that it had been adopted by .180 votes to 100. M. Take Jonescu would resign that day.
On the following day Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed that a new Cabinet had been, constituted as follows :--M. Jonel Bratianu - - Prime Minister and War.M. Vintyla Bratianu - Finance.M. Vaitoianu        - - Interior.M. Duca   -        - - Foreign Affairs.M. Sassu   -        - - Industry.M. Angelescu       - - Education and ad interim Commerce.M. Constantinescu - - Agriculture.M. Banu    - Public Worship and ad interim Public Works.M. Marzescu        - - Labour.M. Floreseu         - - Justice.M. Inculetz          - - Minister for Bessarabia.M.

Young reported [No. 12] on 15th January that the Minister of Finance, accompanied by the Minister of Justice, had been to see him unofficially, and had spoken to the following effect: Owing to the continued fall of the dinar the merchants of Belgrade would be unable, without ruin&apos;to themselves, to meet,their engagements abroad, which, as regards the United Kingdom, are estimated at 500,000LDemands had been made for a, renewal of the moratorium or for other legal measures having a similar effect or entailing assistance from the public funds of this country. Such schemes were not acceptable to the Government, as there was strong opposition on the ground that they would respectively do great harm, to the credit of the country or raise political difficulties consequent on the necessity for exercising discrimination.It was considered, therefore, desirable, if possible, that an amicable arrangement, assisted by the influence of the two Governments, should be arrived at between creditors and debtors.The Ministers pointed out that if customers who habitually traded with England were thrown out of business owing to bankruptcy proceedings, the connexion would be lost and possibly never recovered, while merchants who traded with countries with depreciated currencies would flourish and increase their business.As a solution, the Ministers suggested that guarantees under the Export Credits Act should be applied by His Majesty&apos;s Government retrospectively to transactions from which these debts arose, extending the period uuder which debts can be repaid by instalments.The Ministers explained that the Belgrade bankers were not in a position to offer guarantees for these debtors, but it was suggested that an arrangement should be made under which some bank or other institution should be selected to act as trustee for the successive deposits of dinars necessary for the payment of each instalment, together with a deposit of the security assigned for the value of the whole debt.It was stated that the situation was very grave, and the need for solution so urgent that I was earnestly requested to telegraph.SPAIN.The &quot; Juntas &quot; Crisis. The following telegrams [Nos. 5, 6 and 7] were sent from. Madrid by Sir Esme Howard on 12th, 14th and 17th January respectively :--(1) Seiior Maura yesterday handed to the King the resignation of the Cabinet in a letter which is published to-day. In it he stated that the Government, for reasons of supreme interest to the country, had unanimously decided to submit for the signature of His Majesty a royal decree respecting the military juntas. The Ministers respect the opinion of the matter, in its various and complicated aspects, which was expressed by His Majesty, but considered that the conviction, which inspired their
resolution, prevented them.. from postponing this decree. For the above reason thev can no longer remain in office and ask to be relieved of their duties.The crux of the matter appears to be that the Minister of War having submitted to the King of Spain for signature a decree modifying the statutes of the juntas which would have made the latter really dependent on the Ministry of War, His-Majesty did not see his way to signing it. It is said that the juntas had passed previously a drastic resolution on the subject, declaring that if the decree was signed they would not obey it. The principal Madrid papers this morning recognize the exceptional gravity of the crisis, which amounts, if the juntas get their way, to the open recognition of a military power superior to the civil Government and the Cortes.The conservative A.B.C., for instance, says : &quot;It is not possible that any party or civilian of even moderate repute in a crisis such as this would dare to legalize the degradation of the Government There is no other solution but government by the juntas against the cation or the dissolution of the juntas.&quot;For the present it is difficult to foresee who can replace the Maura Government,The press is at one in deploring that the crisis should have been forced on the Government at a moment like this when so many important questions are hanging in the balance.(i&apos;) During the last two days the King of Spain has discussed the situation with the leaders of the various political parties. The conservative leaders practically all agree that civil Government must be upheld against the juntas ; the opinion of Senor Sanches Guerra, now recognized as the leader of the liberal conservatives in place of Senor Date, being, however, rather less vigorously expressed than that of the others. The liberal leaders, on the other hand, ascribe the present situation to the failure of past Governments to introduce real democratic reforms in every branch of the admini-stration, which would in themselves end the power of the juntas by impoverishing their raisori a&quot;fore. They do not therefore appear to support the immediate execution of the decree against the juntas drawn up by the late Minister of War.A forecast of the solution of the crisis is that the King of Spain will on Monday request Senor Maura to take office again; that he will refuse ; and that Senor Sanches Guerra will then be called on to form a Government and will accept, but without carrying matters to extremes against the juntas. Such a solution can only be provisional.The Sol announces this morning that the juntas of the artisans, the engineers, the general staff and the civil guard (gendarmerie) have agreed to declare their own dissolution, thus accepting the spirit of the decree; but the infantry junta remains intransigeant and will not agree to its dissolution in any form.(3) All the remaining military juntas having declared their willingness to accept the royal decree, the infantry junta, which had declared itself opposed to doing so and then agreed subject to certain conditions, one of which was the resignation of the Ministers of War and Finance, gave way yesterday unconditionally. The decree was then signed and is published this morning, and Senor Maura&apos;s Ministry remain in office unchanged. The press and public opinion throughout the country welcome this solution as an affirmation of the civil Government over the military juntas. It will undoubtedly consolidate the Government and strengthen the personal position of the Prime Minister and the Minister of War, who have been the first Ministers for five years to attempt a trial of strength with the juntas with any success. The Minister of War no doubt felt justified in forcing the crisis, feeling that he had at his back the mass -of public opinion in Spain, besides the sympathy of the army in Morocco.It is fortunate that this crisis, which seemed at one moment likely to be the most-serious for a long time past, has been so quickly and satisfactorily solved, and it is to be hoped that the claws of the juntas have really been drawn this time.It is also interesting to note that this is perhaps the first time for years that public opinion in Spain has been aroused to take a real interest, in a question of internal politics and has unmistakably made itself felt.
