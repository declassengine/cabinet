FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Mission in Paris. The Secretary of State for India transmitted [341.1] to the Viceroy of India on 8th July an extract from a. letter dated 28th June received by Lord Hardinge from M. Briand, of which the following is a translation :-The French Government has concluded no arrangement with the Afghan Government, and confined themselves to the assurance of their sympathy for such Afghan nationals as might come to France, at the same time expressing beforehand their satisfaction with the friendly reception which would be ready for Frenchmen who might visit Afghanistan for the development of science or commerce.Mission to the United States [F.C.R., xlvii, p. 2].-Referring to his telegram of 11th July, Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 487] on&apos;19th&quot; July that, so far, the State Department had not taken seriously the suggestion of the creation of an Afghan legation in Washington, but possibly they would agree to send an American consul to Afghanistan. It appeared that the State Department were disposed to do nothing in the matter which might cause embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Afghan envoy was likely to stay in Washington for some time.ALBANIA.Foreign Relations. On 19th July Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 405] to Sir Milne Cheetham, in Paris, as follows  After the admission of Albania to the League of Nations it is impossible to admit any special right or claim to special interests on the part of one Power in that territory, when no such claim to special rights.or interests was put forward at the time of AlbamVs admission.The Mirdites. On 23rd July Lord Granville reported [No. 420] from Athens that the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs had received a telegram from the leader of the Mirdites declaring their constitution as an independent republic, separate from the rest of Albania, and asking for Greek recognition. He added that the newspapers had reported that the troops sent against the Mirdites by the Government of Tirana had been repulsed.On the following day, however, Mr. Eyres telegraphed [No. 24] from Durazzo that the Mirdites had entirely surrendered.ARMENIA.Bolshevik Repression-On 14th Jiily Mr. Norman sent [No. 386] the following message from Teheran : The Armenian Minister asks me to bring to your knowledge the following telegram from the Armenian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Goris, 6th July : &quot;During the last fortnight large Russian forces making furious attacks on Zangezur. Rural population defending themselves heroically. Villages laid waste and ruined, blood flowing in vain. Repression continuous at Erivan, thousands imprisoned. In the name of humanity protest to civilized world and demand of Moscow the end of insensate bloodshed by withdrawal of Russian troops.&apos; Armenian people wish to be free.&quot;The Armenian&apos; Minister expressed the hope that the Armenian nation in its fight for independence will have the sympathy and help of the British Government and people.His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Tabriz telegraphs that the Bolsheviks have completely defeated the Armenians in Zangezur.BALTIC STATES.. Military Convention.-Telegraphing [No. 21] from Riga on 16th July, Mr. Wilton reported the signature of a military convention between Latvia and Esthonia on 7th July.   The Lithuanians had offered to subscribe to this convention but the offer
had not been accepted ; it was postponed pending an examination into the Lithuanian army organization and the settlement of the Vilna question. The military convention is in three parts: (1) is a formal declaration of a defensive understanding against common enemies ; (2) defines the alliance as against Soviet Russia and the federated Soviet Governments; (3) deals with military details. The second and third are secret, but the first will be presented to the Assembly in September for ratification and afterwards communicated to Poland and Finland, the three chief allied Powers, and the United States of America.Economic Convention. In the same telegram [No. 21] mr. Wilton also reported &quot;that the three Foreign Ministers had agreed upon a draft of the heads of an economic convention, embracing a common currency standard, inter-state free trade, and a customs union. , (CHINA.The Proposed Pacific Conference. On 15th July Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed jNo. 273] the following text of a telegram received by the United States Legation in Peking from the State Department :-Inform the Chinese Government that this Government has made enquiry of Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan, whether it would be agreeable to them to take part in a conference to be held in Washington at a time mutually convenient. This question manifestly has a close relation to the Pacific and Far East problems, and-it is suggested that the Powers especially interested in those problems, including China, should undertake in continuation of the conference the consideration of all matters bearing upon their solution with a view to reaching a common understanding with regard to principles and policies in the Far East. Please ascertain by informal enquiry whether it, would be agreeable to the Chinese Government to take part in a discussion relating to Far East problems.Capture of Urga. Sir Beilby Alston reported [No. 279] on 20th July that Urga had been captured by a joint Soviet and Chita force on 5th July, and that Ungern had retreated towards Manchuli.FRANCE.Turkish Gendarmerie in the Neutral Zone. Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 102] as follows to Sir Milne Cheethani on 18th July : The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Constantinople, ,with the approval of the allied High Commissioners, began in May to organize a force of Turkish gendarmerie to be commanded by Turkish officers, assisted and advised by British officers, for the safeguarding of life and property in the neutral zone on the Asiatic shore of the Bosporus between the Black Sea and the entrance of the Gulf of Ismid. The maximum strength of the force would be 600 and its total cost 3,0001. sterling per month.   The British officers would be paid by His .Majesty&apos;s&apos;s Government.Please obtain the consent of the French Government to the principle that the Ottoman Government should meet this expenditure and request them to instruct their representative at Constantinople to this effect.GERMANY.The Situation  Telegraphing [No. 365] from Berlin on 13th July, Lord d&apos;Abernon dealt with a telegram from Sir Milne Cheetham giving the views current in Paris in regard to the situation in Germany.That telegram states that there are indications of a more reasonable view being taken in France regarding the withdrawal of the sanctions. It is still, however, generally insisted upon that, on account of (a) the instability of the Wirth Govern-ment, and (6) the small measure of satisfaction as yet given to the allied requirements, the sanctions, if and when withdrawn, must be replaced by some equally reliable guarantees of GermanyV future behaviour. It is further added that the chief obstacles to French acquiescence in the withdrawal of the sanctions is the apprehen-sion lest pan-Germanism may thereby be strengthened.An intelligent German would hold that the above reasons against the withdrawal of the sanctions can only be believed in France if the situation here is completely
misunderstood. The instability of the Wirth Government, which is held to be a reason against withdrawal, is in reality caused in the main by the non-withdrawal itself. French opinion indeed alleges as a reason against, withdrawal what is in the main the result of non-withdrawal. It is creating a clanger which it fears, like a clog, barking at its own shadow.The same observer would hold that the second point, namely the small measure of satisfaction as yet given to the allied requirements, can only be maintained by those who are not informed as to the facts. During the seven weeks in which the Wirth Government has been in power, gold and Treasury bonds to the enormous amount of 50,000,000 sterling have been handed over to the Allies by the German Government arrangements for the future working of the ultimatum guarantees have been negotiated and the whole of the Einwohnerwehr and Orgesch organizations have been finally dissolved the greater portion of the arms belonging to them having been&quot; handed over to the Commission of Control. So far from constituting a small measure of satisfaction, Herr Wirth has succeeded in carrying through unprecedented achievements.The real clanger of the situation, indeed, may be alleged to proceed (1) from the fact that the sanctions have not been withdrawn ; and (2) from the failure of public opinion in Entente countries, and of the press of those countries at all to understand and appreciate the immense effort which has been made by the Wirth Government and the success in positive achievements which it has resulted in.While the German temperament requires orders rather than requests, it also requires, if the effort is to be sustained, some recognition of its efforts and some return for its performance.It is held in Germany by those who desire an improvement in the relations with France that French opinion, speaking generally, is open to the criticism that it has failed to make a sufficient distinction between the different German Governments  between those who pursue a reasonable policy and those who were not reasonable and resisted just claims. This general criticism is still true. The real danger proceeds from the Right and the chance that they may upset the Wirth Government. This chance is directly increased by an unreasonable attitude on the part of France and by the refusal to withdraw measures of compulsion for which the essential cause and justification have been removed. With suitable recognition on the one side and suitable measures of pressure ready for eventualities on the other, there is no reason, why the satisfactory policy of the last few weeks should not be upheld and continued. But a &quot;fortissimo &quot; at the appropriate moment is not obtained by hitting continuously on the piano some light and shade must be introduced. The German Government must be placed in a position to show the public here that conformity with the policy, and demands, of the Entente pays; that it pays not only in the far and uncertain, future, but in the immediate and positive present. Otherwise, the requisite support will be lacking to maintain a German Government in power.The above summary may be held to represent, not unfairly, the general view of an intelligent section of the German public.The Payment due on 31st August. Telegraphing [No. 368] on 14th July, Lord cVAbernon reported that the latest available information regarding the payment of a milliard gold marks, or 50 million sterling, clue on 31st August was as follows : -Payments have already been made to the Reparation Commission amounting to 249 million. The German Government have obtained an advance through Mendelsohn of 150 million, and the special Government exchange office (Devisen-beschatzungsstelle) has 200 million bills in their portfolio. This makes a total of 599 million. There remain 401 million to be found before the end of August. I understand there is every prospect of finding the necessary exchange, as the banks are known to have an ample supply.[f the above information turns out to be correct, the difficulty will have been negotiated successfully for the present.Upper Silesia.French Eepresentations.-On 17th July Lord d&apos;abernon telegraphed [No. 373] as follows :  &apos;The French Ambassador yesterday made sharp representations from his Govern-ment to the German Government, declaring that a dangerous situation exists in Tipper Silesia owing to the attitude of the Germans and making extensive allegations.
as to the continuance of the German self-defence organizations, the non-surrender of their arms, &amp;c. Recent attacks on French officers and officials were cited, and it was indicated that the French Government had decided to send immediately a further division to Upper Silesia. The French Ambassador also demanded verbally that Germany should take all necessary measures, (1) to disarm the self-defence corps, to dissolve them and to remove them from the vicinity of the frontier; (2) to prevent resistance being offered to the decisions of the Allies, and to the carrying out of the peace treaty ; and (3) to facilitate the rapid transport of any reinforcements which may be sent to Upper Silesia.German Attitude. On 19th July Lord d&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No. 377] a resume of a conversation he had had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs : The Minister again assured me that any idea of a German &quot;putsch&quot; in Upper Silesia was fantastic and childish. The whole Cabinet would be violently hostile to any such movement and he could hear of no confirmation of so foolish an intention even in the most extreme reactionary circles. He was preparing an answer to the French note, lie would specifically refute the greater part of the French assertions. His explanation of the whole episode is that the &quot; Le ttond-Korfanty conspiracy &quot; has failed. They are trying to cover their failure by promoting a fourth Polish insurrection. Some importance attaches to the report that Korfanty arrived in Paris on the day before M. BriainPs note. But the root of the whole matter is in his opinion that as long as Le Pond remains there will bo trouble, as soon as lie goes there will be an improvement, if not peace.The Demand for Transport. On 2 tth July Lord d&apos;Abernoa reported [No. 389] that Dr. Rosen had sent him the following opinion by the legal adviser of the Foreign Office on the demand for transport facilities to Upper Silesia for a French division: Para. 2 of the appendix to article 88 of the Versailles treaty lays down&apos; that Upper Silesia shall be occupied by troops of the allied and associated Powers, and that Germany is bound to render possible the transport of these troops to Upper Silesia. The Powers concerned in the occupation of Upper Silesia, that is to say. England, France, and Italy, form in respect of the occupation one-whole and, in all questions regarding the occupation, cannot approach Germany individually but only as a whole. Any claim for.carrying out the movement of troops in accordance with para, 2 cannot therefore be asserted by any one of the three Powers in its own name, but only in the name of the Powers as a whole. This is specially clear from the conditions of article 375, which supplements the above-mentioned- para. 2, according to which Germany has to comply with the transport instructions concerning the movement of troops in connexion with the execution of the treaty if such instructions are issued by one authority acting in the name of the allied and associated Powers.GREECE.The Capture of Kutaliia and Esltishehr. On 20th July Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 411] as follows :&apos;--The news of the capture of Kutahia reached Athens late in the evening of 18th July, and was announced by the President of the Council in the Assembly. The church bells were rung, and crowds perambulated the streets most of the night, cheering and firing revolvers, &amp;c. They twice visited His Majesty&apos;s Legation in the early hours of the morning, and cheered for Great Britain and the Prime Minister. They did not visit the other Legations. Yesterday morning a salute was fired of 101 guns, and there was an official thanksgiving service in the cathedral.All the papers publish enthusiastic panegyrics of the greatest victory Greece has ever known, and some suggest that it will be known as one of the decisive battles of the world. They declared yesterday that it was the final victory of the campaign, and stories were told of the varying numbers of prisoners up to -50,000. To-day, as no details have yet been received, a little water is put in the wine, aud one paper at least points out that if the Turks have been able to retire north and north-east there are very strong positions still to be taken.The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me this morning that the Government had no details yet, but that the King had telegraphed to the President of the Council that the victory was most satisfactory.Telegraphing [No. 418] again on the following clay, he said that the news of the capture of Eskishia had led to similar scenes.   A very large crowd again came to30-4 . B V .
His Majosty&apos;s Legation in the early hours arid cheered for Great Britain, the King, and the Prime Minister. There- were again this morning church bells, a salute of 101 guns, and a &quot; Te Deum.&quot;The enthusiasm of the Greek press is, of course, greater than ever; it is declared that the decisions of the treaty of Sevres are no longer sufficient for Greece, who must now have a proper strategic frontier within which she can exploit the fertile lands of Asia Minor and protect labour well-being and equality without distinction of race or religion. Several papers suggest that the road from Eskisbia leads not to Angora but to Constantinople. One Government paper argues that the Powers have chosen to declare that the present hostilities are not a continuation of the Great War, and that they disinterest themselves in them, and look on them as a matter between the Greeks and the Turks. Well and good, the Greeks accept that view, regard them as the final phase of the war of independence which began a hundred years ago, and claim that the peace which will soon be imposed js also a matter between the Greeks and the Turks alone ; at the same time the peace which Greece will impose wall be in the interests of the whole of Europe.-Loan from, the National Bank.-On 12th July Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 398] that the President of the Council had announced that a convention had been concluded with the National Bank, in virtue of which the bank would accord to the Government a loan of 150.000,000 drachmas. Lord Granville added that the governor of the National Bank had left suddenly for England on an official mission.Adjournment of the National Assembly. According to a telegram [No. 4-22] sent by Lord Granville on 23rd July, the National Assembly adjourned that day until 10th October, after passing a large number of urgent measures including the increase of the King&apos;s civil list.ITALY.Position of the Government. Mr. Kennard telegraphed [No. 310] as follows from Pome on 22nd July :  The Governments position is critical and has been weakened by continued disturbances between the Fascisti and the Communists with serious loss of life. The action of the Catholics in voting with the Socialists over an election petition has caused alarm amongst the Liberal Democrats and the Social Democrats who were already perturbed by the Catholic predominance in the Government. These two groups threaten to vote against the President of the Council whom they consider to be in Catholic hands.Mustapha Kemal. The following telegram [No. 311] was sent by Mr. Kennard on 22nd July : The press reports that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has seen Fety Bey, the representative of Kemal, who is about to proceed, to Angora and had asked for facilities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, while expressing his readiness to grant facilities, requested Fety to convey to Mustapha Kemal the painful impression of the Italian Government at the hostile attitude shown by the Turkish nationalists on the evacuation of Adalia by the Italians. Italy, in view of the regard she had shown to the nationalist interests, had a right to expect a more friendly attitude. The refusal of Mustapha Kemal to receive Tiiozzi and other incidents (? further) require explana-- tion. Fety promised to bring the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to&apos;the notice of Mustapha Kemal.Mr.1 Kennard added that he had enquired at the-Ministry for Foreign Affairs if this interview had taken place, and had been informed that it had, but that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had only given Fety good advice.Turltisli Gendarmerie in the Neutral Zone. A telegram [No. 308] was sent by Lord Curzon to Sir George Buchanan on 18th July in the same terms as that printed under &quot;France,&quot; and instructing him to obtain the consent of the Italian Government.JAPAN.The Pacific Conference. Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 259] as follows from Tokio on 14th July : The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me to-day that he had received a telegram from the Japanese Ambassador in London communicating your proposals,
and that on llth July the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires had sent him a note enquiring whether the Japanese Government would bo disposed to accept an invitation, if such were made, to attend a conference at Washington which would deal with both the disarmament and the Pacific questions. The interval was so short that he was not sure whether (his invitation was the result of your conversation with the Japanese Ambassador, or a spontaneous communication from the President of the United States. In any case it would give the Japanese Government pleasure to send delegates to, any conference summoned to deal with disarmament. With regard to discussions dealing with the Far East and the Pacific, the Japanese Government had no objection to the examination of general questions, such as the policy of the -open door in China. Put if it was proposed to bring before the conference questions which are at present the subject of negotiation, such as Shantung, Siberia and the emigration of Japanese to California and elsewhere, then the Japanese Government could not give an unqualified assent. . (One group undecypherable) absolutely refuse to admit the right of the conference to discuss these questions; but they thought that the natural way to treat them was by negotiation between Japan and the Powers immediately concerned in each case, and that a very special reason must be shown for treating them otherwise. I understood that a reply had been sent to the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires in this sense.The Minister for Foreign Affairs then said he had just had a further com-munication from the Japanese Ambassador in London of which I have as yet heard nothing from you, suggesting that a conference about the Pacific question should be held in London next month. He had not yet had time to submit.it to the Cabinet, but he thought that the Japanese attitude would be as indicated above.In another telegram [ho. 260] sent on the same day Sir Charles Eliot reported that the opinions expressed in the press were not enthusiastic. He said too that the military attache after speaking of these matters at the War Office had the impression that they were profoundly distrustful of the United States and really disliked the idea of the proposed conferences; and the Foreign Minister had made the same impression upon himself.PERSIA.8&apos;oulh Persia Rifles [F.C.R., xlvii, p. 7].&apos; Replying to the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram [No. 268] of Jst July, Mr. Norman telegraphed [no number] on 16th July his firm belief that the Persian Government would take over the South Persia Rifles&apos; if they could find the money, and were convinced that nobody else would be prepared to maintain the force. Mi-. Norman, however, had informed the Persian Government that the force must be dissolved.The position was that, unless Soviet rule in Russia came to a speedy collapse, our stake in Northern-Persia was already lost, and we were preparing to give up -everything in the rest of the country, where we might still be able to hold it. Although he had hitherto deprecated the advance of money to the present Persian Government without control of its expenditure, Mr. Norman had abandoned that -attitude, as he was of opinion that the necessity of maintaining the South Persia Rifles was paramount over other considerations. He suggested, therefore, that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be invited to make a monthly loan on the security -of future royalties, on the only condition that the Company should take over the force and its maintenance, 1o be allotted from the loans, over a period of three months. At the end of that period, if no permanent solution of the question had been found, the retirement of British officers would take place, and the force would dissolve for want of means of maintenance.The advantages of this course would be, firstly, the gain of time in view of Bolshevik iuternal difficulties. Secondly, we should be relieved of the damaging reproach of having deliberately dissolved the force and forsaken those who had put their trust in us. Thirdly, it would still leave us with a balance of 225,000L available. A further important argument in favour of the proposal was that, failing our assistance, the Persian Government would be likely to try to obtain a loan from the United States, which, as Mr. Norman gathered from the United States Charge d&apos;A.ffaires, that Government would be slow to discourage.On the same date Air. Norman telegraphed [No. 390] that the Persian Govern-meat were prepared to accept the Financial AdviseFs proposal (embodied in the suggestion in his preceding telegram), on the condition that British officers should retire at the end of three months, and that the force should then come under Persian 30-4 C
command, officers from some other European country being engaged as instructors, for all Persian forces. . Mr. Norman had pointed out the various objections to this condition, and especially the impossibility of officers from other European countries being ready to take over the force within the required period, even should they be-willing to do so. As Mr. Norman considered the Persian. Government were not serious in their proposal, and the Inspector-General advised the early decision of the question one way or the other, he had authorized the latter to begin disbandment.Referring to Mr. Norman&apos;s telegram of 16th July, the Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 296] to him on 22nd July that the possibility of maintaining the South Persia Rifles, at least for a time, had been considered by an inter-departmental meeting. It appeared that the only alternative to the complete disbandment of the force, which had already begun, was to adopt the proposal put forward in the two telegrams given above. The conditions attaching to the proposal were clearly unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. If, however, the fall of the Persian Government within the three months&apos; limit should lead to the avoidance of these conditions, or if the Persian Cabinet could arrive at an appreciation of the benefit which would accrue to the whole of Persia by the continuance of the Rifles to maintain order in the south, and the conditions were set aside, the Secretary of State would be prepared to assent to an arrangement on the lines indicated by Mr. Norman for providing 30,0001. a month, the minimum sum required for ,the-maintenance of the force.The following telegram [No. 404] from Mr. Norman, dated 22nd July, was received, at the Foreign Office on the day after the despatch of the preceding telegram: In view of the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles, the consul at Shiraz recommends that a Chamber decision be taken on the question of whether women and children there should be evacuated to the coast.In the opinion of the Inspector-General of the South Persia Rifles, riots in Shiraz and marauders on the road will be certain later on. Both the consul at Shiraz and the consul-general at Bushire recommend the early evacuation of Shiraz, although the journey in the heat will entail much suffering, and I feel bound to support their opinion, which is based, on the knowledge of local conditions. The Consul-General. at Isfahan points out that evacuation of that town is not yet necessary as the Bakhtiari road provides an alternative means of escape. The consul at Kerman and vice-consul at Yezd do not recommend evacuation now. They state that if the situation becomes bad in the autumn, the road by Duzdap will probably still be open.Have I your authority to sanction the evacuation of Shiraz by British women and children at Government expense ?1&apos;elations with Afghanistan [F.C.R., xlv, p. 5].-Referring to the statement made by the late Persian Government reported by Mr. Norman [No. 325] on 3rd June, the following message was sent [No. 289] to hiui from the Foreign Office on 20th July :  As the treaty between Persia and Afghanistan has been signed no useful purpose-would be served by further pressing the Persian Government to reserve their right to invite the mediation of Great Britain. It is presumed that Persia, as a member of the League of&apos; Nations, will take an early opportunity of submitting the treaty to the--Secretariat-General.The Viceroy of India reported&apos;[104-7 S.] on 9th July the transmission of a telegram from the Afghan envoy at Teheran to the Foreign Minister at Kabul saying that the appointment of an Afghan consul at Meshed had been formally recognized by the Persian Government, and that the consul had been permitted to proceed thither.-Defection of A&apos;osrat-ed-Dowleh [F.C.R , xxxviii, p. 6]. On 19th July Mr. Norman sent [No. 394] the following information concerning Nosrat-ed-Dowleh, whose political arrest was a consequence of the coup d&apos;etat in February : Nosrat-ed-Dowleh, who on his release sent me an obsequious message protesting his unchanged devotion and soliciting my support to obtain power, a day or two later put himself at the head of the anti-British party, and has since spared no effort to injure us. I. understand that he still professes friendly feelings towards Great Britain in the abstract, and that his hostility is directed against the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have pursued, notably in helping the late Prime Minister, and especially against this Legation which he affects to believe responsible for the latteFs accession to power. He has been trying to ingratiate himself with the Russian Minister by-professing socialism, but the latter will have nothing to do with him.
At his instigation 41 deputies, including himself, signed a document purporting to he a narrative of recent events issued by members of the Medjliss. It contains an attack upon the late Prime Minister, and a veiled one on His Majesty&apos;s Government, to whom, however, it does not allude by name. As originally drafted, it was so. violent that no deputy could be induced to sign it, and it has been necessary to spend several weeks in intimidation and cajolery in order to obtain the signatures over which it finally appeared. It has been widely circulated here, and is, I hear, to be translated into various languages, and presented to all civilized Governments and to the League of Nations.He is now preparing a more comprehensive and historical manifesto to be signed, I understand, by released prisoners, showing the extent of continuous oppression from which Persia has suffered at the hands of Great Britain. The tone of this is expected to be more offensive.RUSSIA.Message from M. Ckicherin. The following message was sent from Moscow on 20th July :-- :  &apos;Aux gouvernements de la Grande Bretagne, cle la France, de lTtalie, des Etats Unis cVAmericpie, de la Chine et du Japon.   Dix neuf juillet.   La nouvelle parvient au gouvernement russe par Pentremise (1&apos;organes cle la presse etrangere qu&apos;une conference des puissances riveraines du Pacifique, on y posseclent des interets, serai t convoque incessament a Washington.   Le gouvernement russe ne pent cachet sa surprise extreme, en qualite de puissance riveraine du Pacifique, en apprenant que 1&apos;intention existe de reunir une conference cle ce genre sans sa participation.   Bien que la republique russe et la republique clemocratique extreme orientale possedent des territores sur les cotes du Pacifiqne, les puissances qui on pris la decision de se reunir a Washington ont neglige cPinyiter a cette reunion les republiques russe et extreme orientale.  Cette circonstance, extremement serieuse en elle meme, est encore aggravee du fait que clurant 1&apos;echange de vues a eu lieu a ce sujet, et sur lequel des com-munications ont ete faites a la presse, le droit cle la Russie a participer a une conference, ayant ponr objet les questions se rattachant au. Pacifique, a ete pleinement reconnue. Mais les puissances en question declarent qu&apos;elles prendront elles-inemes en con-sideration les interets cle la Russie sans la presence de cette clerniere et se- reservent d &apos;&quot;inviter eventuellement un nouveau gouvernement Russe, remplacantle gouvernement actuel, a aeceder aux resolutions et accords qui y seront adoptes.   Le1 gouvernement russe ne pent, en aucun cas, consentir a ce que d&apos;autres puissances s&apos;arrogent le droit cle parler pour lui, cPautant plus que 1&apos;ostracisme dont if est frappe ne vise que le gouvernement des ouvriers et des paysans, et que tout gouvernement contre-revolutionuaire qui le remplacerait n&apos;y serait point dispute.   Une telle attitude de la part des puissances precitees ne pent etre interprets que comme nettement favorable a la contre-revolution russe et comme une nouvelle manifestation du systeme interven-tionniste.   Le gouvernement russe proteste hautement contre son exclusion d&apos;une conference qui le vise clirecteinent et contre toute intention, de quelque puissances que (;e soit, cPadopter des decisions touchant le Pacifique a 1&apos;insu cle la Russie.   Le gouvernement russe declare solennellement qu&apos;il ne reconnaitra aucune decision qui serait prise par la conference en question tant que cette reunion a lieu sans sa partici-pation.   Quelles que soient les decisions de cette conference le gouvernement russe qui n&apos;y aura pas pris part conservera en consequence sa pleine liberte dans toutes les questions qu&apos;y auront ete traitees et fera valoir cette liberte cPaction dans toutes les occasions et par tons les moyens qu&apos;il jugera opportune.   II saura done dejouer tout dessein clout la realization serait preparee par cette conference et qui lui serait hostile ou ne concorderait pas avec ses vues.   II se croit en mesure d&apos;affirmer que les decisions de cette conference resteront en realite nulles et sans vigueur, vu Pabsence et la non participation d&apos;uu des principaux interesses.   En meme temps le gouvernement Russe se voit oblige de declarer qu&apos;il ne pent voir clans la preference, eventuellement accordee par les gouvernements precites a un gouvernement contre-revolutionuaire qui le remplagerait, qu&apos;un acte hostile dirige contre lui et contre les ouvriers et les paysans russes, clout il represente la volonte.   II est aussi venu a la connaissance clu gcuvernement russe quhine question plus generate celle du desarmeinent, au moins du desarmement naval, sera examine a la future conference.

10que ce desarmement devieiidra une realite, etant donne que la possibility de ces garanties lm apparait actuellement comme assez douteuse. Oependant le desarme-ment en lui meme ne peut, que lui etre sympathique. II constitue meme selon lui un des resultats auxquels la generalisation des changements sociaux, tels que ils se sont operes en Russie, doit aboutir.
