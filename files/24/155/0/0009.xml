FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Relations with the United States [F.C.R., xlviii, p. 2]. Referring to his telegram [No. 487] of 19th July Sir Auckland Geddes was notified [No. 476] from the Foreign Office on 2nd August, that while His Majesty&apos;s Government had no desire to interfere with the discretion of the United States Government, they would be glad to hear from the State Department that they were indisposed to send a diplomatic or consular mission to Kabul, in view of the close relations which were understood to exist between Moscow and the Afghan Government.In reply to the above Sir Auckland reported [No. 533] on 5th August that his information from the Under Secretary of State was that the United States Government had no intention at present of sending either a diplomatic or a consular mission to Kabul.Russian Representative at Kabul. On 18th July Sir Henry Dobbs reported to. the Viceroy of India [1780 S.] that M. Raskolnikoff had arrived in Kabul on his appointment to the post hitherto occupied by M. Surits. The following paragraphs are extracts from a document conveying instructions to &quot; Comrade Roskolnikoff, plenipotentiary representative at Kabul,&quot; over the signature of M. Chicherin : &quot; Ours is a policy of peace and co-operation between all peoples. At present, to the Eastern nations, being as they are, economically backward, and bitterly resenting foreign economic oppression, Socialist Soviet Russia appears as their only friend. Our policy in the east is not aggressive, it is a policy of peace and friendship. In the whole of your work you must always systematically put forward this basic part of our policy, and in particular, in Kabul, you must regard as the principal aim of your activity the furthering of our friendship with Afghanistan.You must by all means avoid the fatal mistake of making artificial attempts to instil communism in a country where there are no foundations for it. We say to the Afghan Government: &quot; We have one,social order, you have another; you have one&apos; set of ideas, ours are different; however, we are bound together by our common aims towards complete independence and self-activity of our peoples. We are not interfering in your internal affairs, nor are we trespassing, upon the independent, activity of your people; we are ready to promote every factor which plays a progressive part in the development of your people. Not for.a moment do we aim at forcing upon your people a programme which is foreign to its present stage of development.&quot;On the &quot;other hand, you must take consideration of some dangerous deviations on the part of -some of the Afghan ruling classes, who dream of creating a coalition of reactionary mussulman countries under the hegemony of Afghanistan. Up till now the British agents have supported and furthered these dangerous aspirations of a section of the Afghan Government. We are loyally fulfilling our agreement with Great Britain, and have the right to demand the same loyalty to ourselves. You are instructed to watch carefully whether the British representatives are not continuing to play on this dangerous striving for reactionary panislamist hegemony of some Afghan politicians, and whether the British agents are not in this way creating difficulties for Soviet Russia in Central Asia,Peaceful co-operation between the peoples appears to us in its concrete shape, in the first instance, in the form of an exchange of goods, and in this respect Afghanistan is of great value to us. It is out of place here to go into details of this question, this, being the object of the Narkomvneshtorg. I shall confine myself to pointing out that even in this region there are dangerous symptoms against which you must be on your guard, i.e., the determination of certain Afghan commercial circles to engage in. speculation, which must inflict serious injury upon the economic life of Central Asia. It is particularly the economic field of our co-operation with Afghanistan, having in view its greac importance to us and the seriousness of the injury which can be inflicted upon us by the above-mentioned dangerous symptoms, which prompts us to call your
serious attention to the necessity of the development of our consular service in Afghanistan, provided for by the Russo-Afghau Agreement. We need consuls in Afghanistan for the development of our trade, and also in order to counteract the -dangerous symptoms to which I referred before.&quot;ALBANIA.. I idly&apos;s Attitude. Telegraphing [No. 316] from Rome on 26th July Mr. Kennard reported that he had. been informed by the Minister for Foreign A ffairs that, so long-as a-stable Government existed in Albania, Italy had no desire to hold a privileged position. In the event, however, of a breakdown of the Government, resulting m a state of anarchy and the invasion of the country by some such Power as Greece or Serbia, Italy would be bound to resume the position she held in 1920. The disappearance of an independent Albania should give her the right to re-examine the question on the basis of her position before Valona was evacuated. Italy could never give up Saseno Island, which was an important strategic point of the Adriatic, and, in their view, did not belong to Albania.Serbian Movements [F.C.R., xlvii, p. 2]. Mr. Strang telegraphed [No. 168] from Belgrade on 6th August that, according to the press, small bodies of Albanian Government troops, during operations against the Mirdites, had made slight incursions into territory occupied by the Serbs, in the course of which two of the latter had been wounded. The Assistant Minister - for Foreign Affairs confirmed, the above, and informed him that, as long as the menace was not serious. Serbian troops would conteut themselves with repulsing attacks.ARABIA.Position in the Ilejaz. Colonel Lawrence, telegraphing [No. L. 4] from Jeddah -on 2nd August, stated the military position of King Hussein to be: 40 men at&apos; Jeddah, 50 men at Mecca, 500 men at Taif, with 30 automatic and some German maxims, and 60 mounted infantry. Except some 300 Syrians trained by the Turks, these troops were of little military value, and, although, regularly paid, were underfed -and dissatisfied. They would fight the Wahibis, as they knew they would receive no quarter in any case. The civilian and tribal population had no sympathy with King Hussein, and would offer no resistance to the Wahibis, of whom they lived in terror. The Hejaz outpost lay 28 miles east-south-east of Taif, and Colonel Lawrence was of -opinion that Khalid, who occupies the country beyond that, could, with an expedition of 1,000 armed Wahibis, take both Taif and Mecca.&apos; Khalid, however, has not so many at his disposition, and views Ibii Saud with mistrust.BALTIC STATES.Political Convention. Information received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Finland, that a protocol between four of the Baltic States was to be signed the next day, was telegraphed [No. 121] by Mr. Rennie on 28th July. The following is a summary of the protocol: (1) Mutual support between the signatory States in matters concerning their development and independence. Inter-communication of -all treaties signed between various States. No signatory to conclude a treaty with any other Power directed against any other signatory. The holding of periodical meetings -of the Foreign Ministers of the signatory States; with the eventual inclusion of Lithuania. (2) (a) Agreement upon a common policy towards Russia regarding the re-establishment of peace and the&apos; execution of treaties, aud interchange of information on all questions connected with Russia ; (6) a note to be presented to the Soviet Government by each of the signatories on 25th August, in anticipation of the representations to Russia regarding non-compliance with treaties, not leading to the -desired results ; (c) declaration by the signatories of readiness to give assistance to Russia against famine and epidemics.Poland and Finland, the two signatories who are now members of the League of Nations, will be prepared to support the application of Latvia, and Esthonia for -admission to the League, towards whom a policy analogous to that indicated above will be adopted.
Economic Convention [F.O.R,, xlviii, p. 2]. On 28th July, from Helsingfors,. Mr. Rennie reported [No. 123] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him. that Latvia, Esthonia and Finland will probably shortly enter into negotiations with Russia, at the latteFs request, for the conclusion of a convention for co-ordinating a system of transit of sea-borne goods from the ports of the three countries concerned.CHILE.   ,Resignation of the Ministry. Mi. Vaughan reported [No. 82] on 26th July, that the Ministry had resigned owing to the vote in the Senate (25 to 4) that the Govern-ment, in granting to the Nitrate Railway Company, through Knox-Little, the extension of the concession and the increase of the tariff by a presidential decree, and without consulting the Senate, had acted illegally and also contrary to national interests. .&apos;    CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Assistance to Russia. On 5th August Sir George Clerk sent the following -telegram [No. 93]: The Minister for Foreign Affairs-informs me that the Czecho-Slovak Government has decided to give material assistance to combat famine in Russia. It is proposed to send a mission of doctors, several fully-equipped hospital trains, &amp;c, and the Government is beginning to collect clothing and food.. The-Ozeeho-Slovak Government has asked for the assistance. of, different public and political organizations, and. hope that the entire population will help in alleviating the distress of their fellow-creatures. The Government is anxious that this undertaking-should develop into an international one, and. invites the collaboration of other-countries. The International Red Cross has already been approached. The Czecho-Slovak Government is prepared to place at the disposal of any international-organization jnany medical men and others who know Russia and the language.The motives-are not only humanitarian, but also inspired by the. wish to prevent the spread of contagious diseases, especially cholera, to the neighbouring countries. . ,   The Minister for Foreign Affairs asks whether His Majesty&apos;s Government will be-- ready to join in any such action. ,   .FRANCE.Sentiments of the Vatican. On 3rd August Lord Hardinge reported [No. 569] as. follows : Monsignor Cerretti arrived in Paris this morning to assume his functions as Papal Nuncio. He has announced in an interview that the prosperity of France is the dearest wish of the Holy See ; that he will be careful not to forget that France is a great Republic and a democracy ; and that he is confident that the appointment of regular negotiations between France and the Vatican will lead to the settlement of even the most delicate questions, including the Eastern question, to which Monsignor : Cerretti said he proposed to devote particular attention.GERMANY;Taxation Proposals. On 7th August Lord D&apos;Abemon telegraphed [No. 413] ihe-following information: A communique has been issued stating that the Cabinet have-approved the following taxation proposals : An increase of the sugar tax from 14 marks per 100 kilos to 100 marks per 100 kilos, an increase of 500 per cent, on brandy&apos;, 400 per cent, on illuminants, 100 per cent, on matches and mineral waters, 400 per cent, on beer.   The coal tax to be increased up to 30 per cent, of the value with discretion to reduce this temporarily to 25 per cent..Increased customs duties on certain fruits, tea, coffee, chocolate and luxuries. A tax on betting and an increase in taxes on tobacco, motor cars and lorries. The-turnover tax to be doubled, the levy on assessable income of trading corporations to-amount of 30 per cent. Extensive alterations are - proposed with the object of intensifying the existing taxation on Stock Exchange operations, company, promoting; and capital operations generally, as well as. on- Reichsnotopfer and earned and -unearned incremebt especially affecting fortunes made since the war.
-SlI-ESIA.The Situation. General Sir William Heiieker sent [No. 306] the following-report on the situation on 2nd August: I had a report on the (? Kreuzburg) (? Kreis) Oberglogau Loebschutz Ratibor Cosel area this morning by an officer who visited the above places yesterday. The general situation is peaceful awaiting the &apos; -decision of the Supreme Council. At Ratibor, especially during the last few days, an -opinion has arisen that no Polish &quot;putsch &quot; is likely at present, whereas about a week ago the Italians were so apprehensive of one that a concentration of Italian forces at Eatibor was imminent. The acting Italian Commissioner told me this himself. The &apos;Germans in the above area are quite ready to take action if the Polish &quot;putsch&quot; comes, and the opinion round Oberglogau is that it would take the Germans about 48 hours to organize a counter-offensive.The general opinion is that the Germans are quite confident that they could deal -effectively with a Polish rising, and further that they would most probably take the law into their own hands, in spite of the Inter-Allied Commission, if they were invaded. They say they are afraid to trust again to the allied forces for the safety of -German property and the large German country-houses. There is a marked anti-French feeling in this area, the Germans being bitter against the French, while the British and Italians regard their arrival in any town with apprehension.Disturbance is the invariable result of such an advent and then the British and Italians have to turn out and protect, the French from insult, which may result in shooting. I am afraid that in many cases these feelings are only thinly disguised, but the danger of showing them is evident, and it is necessary to preserve cordial relationship. At Krapitz, for instance, I am getting the Officer Commanding British troops to hold combined British and French sports. It is only by showing in public to the Germans and Poles that mutual goodwill and friendship exists among Allies that we can keep the country quiet.A concours sportif interallie is being held in Oppeln on 6th, 7th, 8th August, and I trust will be a success.Reporting again [No. 308] on 5th August, Sir William said that the result of a careful reconnaissance of the whole of Upper Silesia, which had been carried out by capable and trustworthy officers, was that the country had been remarkably peaceful during the preceding week. In the industrial area-there was little real trouble, but among the Germans there was a general feeling of fear, because the Poles were not kept in order. He did not anticipate that the Germans would start a &quot; putsch.&quot; unless fresh Freuch troops arrived some little time before the decision of the Supreme Council was given, and only then if they were quartered in districts which were markedly German. It appeared also that a &quot; putsch &quot; was equally out of favour with the Poles unless fostered and supported by the French.&apos; GREECE.The Campaign in Asia Minor. On 30th July Lord Granville telegraphed  No. 433] the following information from Athens : The papers publish an interview with Colonel Pallis, Commander of the General Staff of the army, Asia Minor. After -declaring that the present campaign is the continuation of the age-long struggle of Hellenism to open Asia Minor to civilisation, and comparing the Greek army to that -of Alexander the Great, he said that the campaign had progressed in an excellent manner both as regards its conception and. execution; besides heavy losses to the enemy, there was the occupation of the line Afiun Karahissar-Eskishehr, the real junction of the two Greek groups, and the formation of a single front, while the Turkish connexions between Angora and Konia were cut; the Greek task was not finished, and the second phase was beginning. As regards the final result, he said that Greece had acquired the right to establish herself in the whole country she had occupied, and to be recognized as the guardian of the freedom of the Straits, and this right her army meant to insist on and was strong enough to do so.Custom Duties. The following telegram [No. 430] was sent by Lord Granville on 28th July: A draft law was presented to the National Assembly on 22nd July which, although not passed, came into immediate operation, in virtue of which all custom duties are to be paid in gold drachmas or bank notes reckoning the gold -drachma as 2 &quot;50 drachmas in paper. Municipal dues in addition to customs dues are not affected.31-^-2     - B
HOLLAND.Cabinet Changes. On 27th July Sir Ronald Graham telegraphed [No. 78] the-following:-The ministerial crisis has been solved by the following changes in the Cabinet: The Ministers of Finance and War, Monsieur Vries, and General Pop, are-to be replaced by Jonkheer de Gee and Captain van Dijk respectively. De Gee is a Christian (gr. undeo) member, loyal to the Chamber, and burgomaster of Arnhem.. Van Dijk is an anti-revolutionary and director of the topographical department.JAPAN.Washington Conference-Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 280] the following-report on 29th July : The United States Charge dAffaires stated in private conver-sation that a communication sent to him by the Japanese Government on the night of 26th July indicated their willingness to accept an invitation to attend a conference-at Washington, but expressed a hope that the questions already settled, and questions affecting the sovereignty of one power only, would be excluded from the agenda. He-said that he did not understand what was meant by this second class of questions.. In the first class the Japanese undoubtedly meant to include the decisions of the-conference of Versailles, but the United States did not regard those decisions as final.. He said that the instructions which he had received made it clear that the President of the United- States regarded Japan&apos;s request for a definition of the scope of the conference as reasonable, and had every hope that a satisfactory arrangement, on the lines of conversations now taking place between the Japanese Ambassador at Washington and the Department of State, would be made before the beginning of the-conference.PANAMA.The Frontier Dispute [F.C.R., xliv, p. 6]. Referring to his telegram of 18th May,. Mr. Graham sent [No. 26] the following report on 8th August : -The United States Minister, in an - official note, has called upon Panama to* surrender territory awarded to Costa Rica by the Porras and Anderson convention,, and to appoint a Panama engineer to act with the Costa Rican already appointed and. two United States engineers in the delimitation of the frontier.The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has replied (? rejecting) the convention on the ground that it. is not a treaty, but a mere arbitral pact, and Sir H. Whiter-award, which is based- upon it, has not solved the question in dispute. The Minister for -Foreign Affairs adds that, considering the claims of Costa Rica as unrighteous,. Panama does not accede to them or regard itself as affected by the findings of any Boundary Commission formed without its consent and against its wish. He insists-upon the right of Panama to continue in occupation of the Goto region pending legal and effective settlement.PERSIA.south Persia Rifles [F.C.R., xlviii, p. 7]. With reference to the telegram-[No. 296] of 16th July from the Secretary of State, Mr. Norman explained in a telegram [No. 4-20], dated 31st July, that he had deferred sending his views pending the reply-to a suggestion submitted [No. 391] by him confidentially on I6th July, This-suggestion was that it would be advisable to accept the Persian Governments proposal on condition that the period of three months was increased to six-months, during&quot; which British officers should be retained. The improbability of the present Govern-ment lasting over three months and the general uncertainty in the north induced Mr. Norman to support the proposal. As at the date of telegraphing he had not. received authority to act on it, he had to report that in his opinion there was no chance-that the present Government would waive their condition that British officers should, be replaced by foreign officers. He now advocated the acceptance of this proposal, if the oil companies would find the money as was anticipated, in the hope of a radical, change in the situation before the end of six months. In the meantime one third of the-South Persia Rifles had already been disbanded.On 3rd August the Secretary of State, who had already acknowledged that there were points of strength in the proposal, telegraphed [No. 312] to Mr. Norman that he was authorized to accept it. On hearing from him that the Persian Government agreed in principle, the Secretary of State undertook to approach the Anglo-Persian--Oil Company.
Mission to Angora. Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 429] on 3rd August that Momtaz-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of Public Instruction, had been appointed head of a mission which was to proceed to Angora with the object of inducing the Turkish Nationalist Government to refrain from interference in Persia, especially in Azerbaijan, where danger was apprehended from the support given to Simko. Mr. Norman had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Persian Government had reason to believe that an agreement had been come to between the Turkish Nationalist Government and the Russian Soviet Government by which possession of Maku was to be given to the former.Indo-European Telegraphs. On 5th August Mr. Norman sent [No. 431] the following report from the Consular Officer at Tabriz, dated 2nd August: An (? aged) Greco-German colonist, for many years in the employment of the Indo-European Telegraph Company at Tiflis, has been sent here with a Soviet repre-sentative to ask the director here to repair the Indo-European Company&apos;s line between Julfa and Tiflis,. offering him all facilities in men and material, on the understanding that of the four lines when finished, one shall be at the disposal of the Soviet giving them direct communication between Tabriz and Tiflis.POLAND.Government Assurances. On 1st August Mr. Max Muller sent the following telegram [No. 354]: I have -presented an aide memoire to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, drawing attention to the persistent rumours as to a probable fresh &quot; putsch &quot; by Polish insurgent organizations before the meeting of the Supreme. Council, and the signs of activities observed, especially in the district of Rybnik and Pless, such as the presence of several hundred men in Polish and police uniforms, some of them carrying arms, between Myslowitz and Pless. I also mentioned that there was still a considerable volume of traffic into Upper Silesia; motor lorries and carts crossing the frontier in large numbers along the road from Sosnowice. I added that though I had no evidence that the contents of these vehicles were of au illicit nature, I urged His Excellency to make sure that the utmost vigilance was being exercised to prevent the passage of arms into Upper Silesia.In conversation I added that General Heneker was by no means convinced that Polish insurgents contemplated another &quot;putsch,&quot; still I felt it my duty to bring these reports to the notice of the Polish Government so that they might use all their influence to prevent any fresh act of folly on the part of the insurgents, as it could only mean that all the work of pacification of the last two months would have been wasted and a final settlement postponed again.M. Skirmunt renewed his assurances that the Polish Government had no reason to expect any renewal of insurrection on the side of the insurgents, but he would nevertheless make enquiries as to the foundation for the reports which had reached me, and would renew his warning to the insurgent leaders. The one thing the Polish Government desired was a speedy settlement of the question. He had recently been criticized in the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Diet for his weakness in pushing the Polish case, but be failed to see what more he could do. lie did not, however, disguise from himself the probability that an unfavourable decision would mean the fall of the Government.[See also under &quot; Germany Silesia.&quot;]RUSSIA.Appeal for Assistance in the Famine.-M. Chicherin, the People&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, despatched the. following wireless message [No. 2203] from Moscow -on 3rd August, addressed to all Governments : The vast movement of relief for the famine-striken population of the eastern provinces of European Russia, which, attracted the most &quot;diversified classes and the most varied public bodies in nearly all countries of Europe and America, is -warmly welcomed by the Russian people, and its workers&apos; and peasants&apos; Government. At the same time it must be regretfully observed that these bodies, as well as the press and even the Governments nearly everywhere, display inadequate acquaintance with the real state of affairs in Russia, possessing far from accurate and verified data on the extent of the calamity and its concrete details. The organs of the occidental and American press, and the declarations of statesmen of all
countries, frequently contain absolutely false and sometimes exaggerated or erroneous ideas on the situation in the famine-stricken provinces, and even on the general condition of the Russian Republic. The Russ ian Government deems necessary, therefore, to request in the first place the Governments of all countries to impart in an official manner to citizens interested in the famine, which befell part of Russia, the following- exact data on the question. The Famine Relief Commission of the central executive recognized a state of distress in 10 provinces, viz., Astrakhan, Tsaritsin, Saratov, German Commune Samara, Simbirsk,- Tara Republic, Tchuvash territory, also the following districts in Ufa province, Jlirsk, Belebei, also Yaransk, Urzhum, Malmyzh, Sovietsk in Viatka province, and Serunsk and Krasuokokshaisk in Mairi territory, s Severe continuous drought in these 10 provinces destroyed the harvest entirely, or will yield only 10 or 15 per cent, average, or will affect only certain kinds of the crops. These 10 provinces are inhabited by approximately 18 millions, which will require a minimum of 4.-1 million poods, outside the food supplies from -outside, to sustain the rural population on 50 per cent, of the usual ration excluding cattle, and 18 million poods to feed the urban population. For seeds in localities where the harvest is completely lost 15 million poods are required before 15th September. Lacking quite exact data of the harvest extent&apos; in all other parts of Russia, it cannot yet be determined what portion of the above-stated requirements can be furnished by Russia herself. The famine-stricken provinces have no past grain stocks left, while deliveries from other provinces can only be extremely limited at present.The present distress in these provinces is therefore really very great, yet nowhere occurred any of the excesses and disorders falsely rumoured by the &quot;West European and&apos; American press. In some of the hardest hit localities a despairing population partly seeks, with the assistance of the Soviet authorities, to move to more prosperous Russian provinces, but this movement of famished inhabitants nowhere assumes any such form as would present.the slightest menace to public safety and order.The Russian Government takes all available measures for combating the calamity and relieving sufferers. Russian citizens, independently of political views, manifest the most ardent wish to help the starving population without any political arrihre pensee. The Russian toiling masses everywhere show the fullest readiness for self-denial, imposing privations upon themselves to send relief to their fellow citizens in distress. Also, those who before the revolution belonged to the privileged classes unselfishly strive to help famine-stricken. Alongside with the Government Commission at the Central Executive Committee, the Government authorized the . formation of the independent Famine Relief Committee composed of people outside of Soviet governmental spheres. This Committee will itself distribute all food supplies at its disposal, being a completely independent organization,, and enjoying full support of the Soviet authorities in its activities. Delegates of this Committee will shortly go abroad, simultaneously with another delegation sent to Western Europe by the Central Executive Commission, by the Central Trade Union Council and by the Central Co-operative Union. Infor-mation received daily of numerous organizations in all countries wiUing to help the famine-stricken population in Russia meets with(the wishes of the Russian people and Government, and with the urgent need of the famine-stricken provinces for foreign aid. Addressing itself to all Governments upon this subject the Russian Government permits itself to express the hope that the latter will present no obstacles to public bodies and individual citizens of their countries desirous to help the famine-stricken Russian citizens. The Russian Government will accept for this purpose any aid from whatever source it may come disregarding entirely any existing political co-relations. Expressing on behalf of the Russian people the warmest gratitude to foreign organizations and individuals manifesting such ardent desire to help famine-stricken Russian citizens, the Russian Government thinks itself entitled to hope that the Governments of other countries will present no obstacles or barriers to these desires of their citizens.SPAIN.Ministerial Crisis. Telegraphing [No. 159] from Madrid on 8th August, Sir Esme Howard reported that the Madrid papers stated that a total ministerial crisis had begun and that the King had asked various party leaders to consult him in Madrid. His Majesty had already seen Senor Maura, who seemed favourable to the formation of a Coalition Government. The immediate cause of the crisis was the-resignation of the Minister of War.
