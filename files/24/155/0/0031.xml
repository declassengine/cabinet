FOREIGN COUNTRIES REPORT.ARABIA.The Pilgrimage. The following instructions have been sent to Major Marshall:  King Hussein should be warned that if trouble arises during the pilgrimage owing to any aggressive action on his part, our relations with him will be seriously affected. With regard to the proposal that a mohammedan official from Bahrein should accompany the Nejdis. it might be advantageous either as an alternative or in supplement to this proposal if the pilgrims were met by a British moslem at the Hejaz end. If King Hussein agrees and if you think this desirable as a means of ensuring a peaceful pilgrimage, you should make the necessary * arrangements in direct communication with Sir P&quot;. Cox, to whom this telegram is being repeated.CHINA.The Situation. Sir Beilby Alston has reported as follows :  Chang-Tso-lin&apos;s forces have not yet withdrawn completely beyond the wall and still occupy the neighbourhood of Shan-haikuan. No hostilities have taken place since Wu-Pei-fu&apos;s victory nearly one month ago. The Chihli forces are advancing slowly along the railway after retreating; the Mukden troops and Wu-Pei-fu himself remaining at Patingfu absorbed in politics. There are now, however, indications that an encircling movement of Chihli troops has been for some time in progress, and that Chang-Tso-lin shortly may be again attacked in flank and rear. ; A further withdrawal of Mukden troops is therefore anticipated.Chang-Tso-lin has announced his intention of appropriating the surplus salt, postal and custom house funds, but his independent movement appears unpopular in Manchuria, where a (group undecypherable) rebellion against his rule has also broken out.Apart from Chang-Tso-lin, interest in the political situation during the past month has centred round Wu-Pei-f u&apos;s opposition to the retention of office by the President, who was placed in office by the northern militarists a few years ago, after a forcible dissolution of the old Parliament.&apos; In face of increasing unpopularity, the President has at last yielded and to-day issued a mandate resigning his office; he has left for Tientsin. In accordance with the constitution his duties have in the absence of any vice-president been handed over to the Cabinet and the Premier, pending a decision in regard to his successor. The present idea seems to be to re-convene the old Parliament and reinstate Li-Yuan-hung as being the only living Chinese with a full legal title to preside. A number of members of the old Parliament have already met in Tientsin and requested Li-Yuan-hung to assume office. The latteFs decision is not yet known.There has been no important change in the south, where Sun-Yat-Sen&apos;s anticipated northern expedition is skirmishing on the Kiang-si borders.Later he further reported that overtures had been made to Li-Yuan-htmg by the Cabinet to return to Peking. He had been reported to be taking legal advice as to his position, and at the same time to be making his return conditional on unification, the abolition of military governors and the formation of a national army. It was not known whether the conditions had been complied with, but the acting-premier went down to Tientsin yesterday and returned with Li-Yuan-hung to-day to the capital, where he has taken up residence at his private house instead of proceeding to the Presidents mansion.EGYPT.Position of Officials. Lord Allenby has sent the following summary of the position of officials : 1. The position of British and foreign officials under the new regime has been one of my first preoccupations since I returned from London. A movement of increasing volume and importance has manifested itself for some time amongst them urging the necessity to deal without delay with the question of compensation.
- 2. With a view therefore to meet what appeared to be a justifiable claim, Judge Percival prepared at my request, for presentation to the Egyptian Government,. -&apos;a-compensation scheme which should take effect until the conclusion of a final agreement.3. The scheme was based on the main principles of that put forward by the Foreign Office last year, but modified to meet the comments of. the Government actuary and reduced to an extent that made it practically equivalent to the scheme of the latter.4. It contained four important concessions to the Egyptian Government designed to make it less unpalatable : ,(a). The unrestricted right to dismiss officials ;(o) A veto exercised by myself restricting the right to leave to those who could satisfy me that their position was damnified ;(c) The reduction indicated in the previous paragraph making the total cost of the scheme 20 per cent, less than that of the original one ; and,(d) The adoption of a.sliding scale of reduction of the amounts of compensationallowed by the scheme whereby all sums over 4,0001. were reduced, so that maximum could not exceed 8,500L 5. The scheme was approved by the committee of all advisers and seemed to me . to be fair and equitable.   While it was not hoped to satisfy the demands of the more extreme elements of officials, it was designed as a compromise that should be acceptable to both sides.: 6. I presented it to the Egyptian Government ten. days ago and informed the Prime Minister that it represented the minimum that would be acceptable.7. Some clays later the Prime Minister left with me a note, which was in effect a non possumus.8. It is stated that while personally they would have been glad to meet my wishes as a mark of gratitude for the declaration, of 28th February, the Government were influenced by two considerations : -(a) The general question of compensation of officials could only be envisaged as , a part of the final Anglo-Egyptian agreement.(b) As the Government in all negotiations leading up to the declaration of 28th February had made a rule to enter into no agreements other than that for the maintenance of the status quo pending the conclusion of a final agreement;, it could not engage itself without a mandate from Parliament to make an outlay which by its importance would affect several future budgets.9. It added that pending general negotiations there was no intention to dispense with the services of foreign officials and to replace them with Egyptians, and that the present situation would therefore, remain unchanged. It then said that any official proved to have suffered would be generously treated.10. The note concluded by putting forward three counter proposals : (a) To treat cases as they arose without any special machinery.(h) To adopt the principles of my scheme, taking as a provisional basis the compensation scales proposed in the scheme submitted to the Foreign Office by the Egyptian delegation, subject to the readjustment of amounts awarded in : the event nf a higher scale being agreed, upon under the final arrangement contemplated.(c) Submission of my scheme to Parliament as soon as it assembled in advance ofthe agreement on reserved subjects. 11. (6) is clearly unacceptable as it would involve a semi-recognition of the scale : offered by the delegation, which was totally inadequate; (o) would not be inconsistent, with (group undecypherable) (a), but offers no solution of the present difficulty.12. I then sent for the Prime Minister and explained to him that my scheme was the minimum that I could recommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government and that they would probably insist upon its acceptance.The Prime Minister reiterated the arguments contained in his note and again urged that all cases should, be dealt with as they arose, giving me solemn assurances that they would be treated in a most generous spirit. &apos; The actual sums of money thus involved were not of importance, but neither his Government nor any other could survive acceptance of the general scheme proposed.41-3 &apos; A 2
International Geographical Congress. Reuter&apos;s Cairo correspondent reported on 24-th May that the King had invited the eleventh international geographical congress to hold its sittings in Cairo in 1925 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Egyptian Royal Geographical Society.The King had, he said, appointed a committee of organization under the presidency of Adly Pasha, which included prominent Egyptians, British subjects and other Europeans..   v   JAPAN.     . ;.China. Sir Charles Eliot has informed the Foreign Office that, in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Vice-Minister has spoken to him. about China in the following sense : He understood from the Japanese Minister at, Peking that the British and United States Ministers had very informally thrown, out the idea that, in order to secure the reunion of China, it might be.-opportune to. assist Wu-Pei-fu. The Japanese Government however were of the opinion that any assistance given now, especially financial assistance, would be premature and they desired to maintain the attitude of strict neutrality. They believe that Wu-Pei-fu will not attempt to go beyond Shan-haikuan, and that the present crisis will pass without international complica-tions ; but they are embarrassed by (? the prevalent) brigandage west of the South Manchurian Railway. In order to prevent it they are shifting police to the disturbed districts, but the total number of police has not been increased. General Ono, who has been sent to take command of the troops, is working in close co-operation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.The Japanese troops at (? Hankow) are to be withdrawn, and they have no objection to withdrawing the legation guard from Peking if other Powers do the same. The reduction of troops in Manchuria has been discussed, but nothing has been decided.Ratifications of the Shantung agreement have been exchanged, but the condition of China hinders the immediate execution of details.The Japanese Government are exceedingly anxious to know when His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to ratify the treaties made at Peking.Cabinet Crisis. Sir Charles Eliot reported that the Cabinet had tendered their resignation to the Prince Regent, and that a new one had been formed ; Admiral Baron Kato, the former delegate to the Washington conference, being Prime Minister and Minister of Marine. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Wat-remained unchanged.NORWAY.Minister for Foreign Affairs. Sir Mansfeldt Findlay has reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has resigned, and that M. Mowinckel has undertaken the provisional direction of the department.PERSIA. -The Political Situation, [F.C.R., lxx, p. 4], Sir Percy Loraine has reported thai; he received an urgent, communication from the Minister of War, pressing for an advance of 30,0001 to 40.000L a month for four months, failing which he would be forced, to depend on money from Russia, which he believed he could obtain without difficulty.In reviewing the situation, Sir Percy advocated support being extended to Reza, who was likely to continue in office, as a means of tiding over the difficulties of the moment, and of affording time for considering the desirability of any further-financial aid. . ,POLAND. :,Resignation of the Government. Mr. Hoare reported from Warsaw that discussion. with the Chief of the State had resulted in the resignation of the Government, which., had been accepted.
RUSSIA.Siberia.The Provisional Government. Sir Charles Eliot reported the receipt of the the following messages from Vladivostock :  .(1) General Dietrich has been elected President of the provisional Government and is expected to arrive from Harbin to-morrow.The arrest of M. Merkulov was ordered by the National Assembly, but could not be executed as he was guarded by a body of marines, and force could not be used owing to the Japanese announcement that in the event of an armed conflict they would disarm both sides.(2) General Dietrich, after ascertaining the position on his (? arrival) here, decided to enter into negotiations with LI. Merkulov. As a result the Llerkulov Government has been reinstated for the present, the National Assembly has been dissolved, and the JZenistvo council, to be convened in two weeks, will elect a new Government. General Dietrich becomes Comrnander-in-Chief.SERBIA.relations with Bulgaria. Sir Alban Young reported that it had been agreed between the Rumanian, Greek and Serbian Ministers for Foreign Affairs, who met here at the royal marriage, that a joint note of protest should be made at Sofia against the failure of the Bulgarian Government to restrain the Macedonian bands. The Serbian Government were exasperated at the constant disturbances of the peace, and he. foresaw that radical measures would be taken if no satisfaction were -obtained The Serbian Government consider that the proposal of the present Bulgarian Government of establishing a Serbo-Bulgarian conference to investigate the -circumstances under which bands cross the frontier, was merely an attempt to temporize.TURKEY.Asia Minor Atrocities Commissions. The following information was communi--cated by the Earl of Balfour to Sir Horace Rumbold :  The French Government have proposed (1) the limitation of .the period of -enquiry to the past year, (2) the re-investigation of Greek excesses during the -evacuation of Ismid last June, and (3) the punishment of the guilty.I have accepted the limitation to.the year immediately preceding the date of the appointment of the commissions, on the supposition that that date is not later than 1st duly, refused the re-iiivestigation of Ismid events, and pointed out that in view of the attitude of the United States Government the question of possible sanctions can -only be left over for discussion by the three allied Governments after the reports of the commissions have been considered.As regards the composition of the commissions, we consider that the appointment of commissioners should be left to the four High Commissioners in Constantinople, -acting in concert, and I have pressed the French Government to .send appropriate instructions to their High Commissioner without delay.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Message from Mr. Lloyd George. The following statement of the Prime Ministers views was sent to Sir Auckland, Geddes for communication at his discretion to Mr. Hughes: M. Rakowsky made the following statement on 12th April to the finance sub--commission at Genoa : Russia spent 24 per cent, of its receipts on the maintenance of the army, although it had been greatly reduced in strength during the past year. While on 1st January 1920 there were 5,500,000 men in the army, on 1st January 1921 there -were only 1,450,000. Practically the whole of this force was stationed on the frontiers of the republic. General disarmament was essential, if effective results were to be obtained.
The importance of the facts thus disclosed is threefold : (I) M. Rakowski&apos;s statement putting the strength at 1,450,000 coincides with our estimate of the total men under arms.   How many of these would be avail-( able for operations would depend of course on the impulse behind them and on the nature of the campaign, but the western estimates of Russian fighting capacity have hitherto been very incorrect. Very considerable campaigns have been organized against the Red army from Siberia, the Don, Archangel, Poland and Odessa, and all have ended in absolute failure despite very confident predictions of success.&apos; While, therefore, the Russian army is no doubt deteriorating by comparison with western standards, to the border States it does appear, and in fact is, a formidable instrument of war necessitating the maintenance of large forces on their side. From a purely military standpoint this is dangerous, as all experience proves that when conflicts are apprehended on disturbed frontiers they ultimately occur.(2) In our opinion, however, the danger from the Russian armed forces is not to be calculated solely by the standards of organized and scientific warfare. There is also the danger of marauding movements, which can be very formidable even to a well-organized defence if led by capable men. An armed rabble such as fringes the Russian border is a grave menace to the health and security of neighbouring countries when driven from behind by famine and despair. Military leaders have often made their profit from such conditions, as Napoleon did when he first invaded Italy. But whether any s such leader appears or not, the condition of Russia will make armed.incursions into foreign territory inevitable if famine and pestilence continue i to increase. At the least these would be made by large marauding bands, which would carry desolation, pestilence and political unrest across the frontiers wherever they spread, and which, even when defeated, would, unless exterminated, aggravate the serious existing burden cast upon the border-States by Russian refugees. The Russian cavalry, though poor, is a particular danger in this respect.(3) M. Rakowski&apos;s statement that 24 per cent, of the Russian Governments receipts are still spent on the army shows how grave in a financial sense the continuance of these conditions on both sides must be. Russia herself fears aggression as much as her neighbours do, and while these conditions remain the dangers described in (1) and (2) above wdll steadily increase. There is no remedy in military measures, however provident, for a situation of this kind. On the contrary, the military remedy merely aggravates the disease. Russia is a plague spot and the plague of Russian conditions will inevitably spread across the frontiers of Russia and drag down the conditions of her neighbours unless the condition of Russia herself is improved.This is the essence of the argument which has impelled His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to regard the Russian problem as one in which the possible disadvantages of forcing the pace towards a solution is greatly less than the certain dangers to be-apprehended from indifference and delay.Naval Appropriation 73iZZ. Sir Auckland Geddes informed the Foreign Office that the committee had reported the Naval Appropriation Bill to the Senate carrying a total of $294,000,000, exclusive of the cost of scrapping. The principal increases were :-$ 10,000,000 for new construction; $6,500,000 for new aircraft; $28,000,000 for pay; $4,500,000 for engineering and repairs^ Certain minor decreases had been made.   The bill, he said, would be under discussion this week.
