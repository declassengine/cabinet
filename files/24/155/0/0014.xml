FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.-   ALBANIA.Serb Altaeli, On 16th October Mr. Eyres reported from Durazzo [telegram unnumbered] that the Serbs had attacked in force with three regiments, cavalry, guns and aeroplanes, and had taken Aras and three&apos; other villages. The Albanian forces had retired in face of superior force and had taken up a position defending Luria. The Serbs had also occupied Bunyai. The Albanian Government (? had counter-manded) a levy of volunteers with the exception of Valona and Scutari. They had stated that they desired nothing better than to remain quiet, but&apos; that the Serbian. Government seemed bent on forcing them to fight. A&apos;strong radical movement had suddenly developed in the Chamber, and the Popular party had obtained the adhesion of 45 deputies to revolt against the feudal domination of the beys. It appeared probable that the Ministry would fall.ARMENIA.The Armenians of cilicia. The following telegram [No. 679] was sent from Constantinople by Sir Horace Rumbold on 15th October : - -The heads of the three Armenian relief [? committees] called on me to-day to express their fears regarding the future of the 150,000 Armenians of cilicia. They had seen the French High Commissioner, who admitted that the evacuation of Cibcia. by the French was contemplated and that negotiations were proceeding with the Angora Government. He would inform his Government of their apprehensions and their hopes that provision would be made in the Franco-Kemalist convention for the protection of Christian minorities.   But he could, make them no definite promise.They said that they hoped that the evacuation of Cilicia by the French might be delayed, or that some temporary regime might be set up under allied auspices until the establishment of the national home for Armenians foreseen by the League of Nations. Armenians had been repatriated to Cilicia after the armistice by the British authorities in Syria and Egypt, while British troops were still in occupation. If the French troops left in their turn, they could have no confidence in Turkish Nationalist promises in view of the recent massacres at Marsovan and elsewhere. The emigration of so large a population to some unknown destination presented insurmountable difficulties, and they now appealed to the allied Governments nor, to abandon them to their fate.I told them that His Majesty&apos;s Government was not informed of the negotiations between the French and the Angora Government and that it was very difficult for us to intervene in the matter. But it could not be admitted that the French Government proposed to abandon the Armenians of Cilicia to the tender mercies of the Nationalists without making adequate provision for their security.AUSTRIA.Venice Conference. On 15th October Mr. Lindley reported [No. 238] that the Chancellor had made a statement to the Committee for Foreign Affairs regarding the Venice conference : He stated that he had taken the line that the treaty ought to be carried out and Burgenland cleared of the bands before discussing concession by Austria. (? The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs) had insisted with. all the weight of his own position and the, approval of the other two allied Powers on the necessity of -compromise on the lines indicated by him, adding that on this depended the solution of the problem of financial help for Austria. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs had concluded by saying that a refusal by Austria to agree to this basis of negotiation would, be calculated to irritate the Entente.Under this pressure the Chancellor agreed to the arrangement, of which the following is a short summary, subject to its acceptance by the Austrian Parliament : (1) Burgenland is to be pacified, within three weeks by the Hungarians acting in agreement with the allied generals.
(2) The allied generals are to exercise the administrative authority pending the installation of an Austrian administration.(3) The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs will take the necessary steps to secure the allied troops.(1) Eight clays after the allied generals have agreed that the country is pacified, a plebiscite will be held under their authority in Oedenburg and the surrounding district. Eight days after the plebiscite the district will be handed over to whichever State the plebiscite assigns it.(5) Hungary will pay the damages caused by the delay in handing over the counties, and all financial questions . concerning them must be settled within 14 days of the transfer or settled by arbitration.(6) An amnesty is to be proclaimed as regards political offences.(7) If the plebiscite area falls to Hungary she will assure to Austria frontier facilities, &amp;c.BELGIUM.The Cabinet. On 18th October Sir George Grahame telegraphed [No. 170] from Brussels as follows : M, Anseele, the veteran Socialist Minister of Public Works, attended a large Socialist manifestation at La Louviere on 16th instant, which, town has been the scene of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations of Socialists and their opponents since the public appearance there last month of the German Socialist Sassenbach.It appears that the Minister spoke under or near a Red Cross flag on which was depicted a Belgian soldier breaking his rifle across his knee, but there seems to be some doubt as to whether he noticed, it.M. Deveze, the Minister of National Defence and president of the Liberal Federation, on learning of this wrote to the Prime Minister stating that he could not continue in the same Cabinet as M. Anseele.   He also had an audience of the King.CHILE.Resignation of the Ministry. On 14th October Mr. \raughan telegraphed - No. 104] from Santiago that the Ministry had resigned that day..CHINA.Macao. On 8th October Sir Lancelot Carnegie telegraphed [No. 95] from Lisbon as follows : I called on the President of the [Portuguese] Republic at his request this afternoon. He at once began to speak about Macao. He complained that Iiis Majesty&apos;s Government showed a certain coldness in the matter to their old ally. I asked in what respect. Pie replied that although they gave advice, they gave no assistance. The moral effect of the presence of the British gunboat which had come to Macao from Hongkong had been excellent, but it had now been withdrawn whilst Chinese ships remained. What he wanted was that His Majesty&apos;s Government should let it be known at Canton, and if necessary at Peking, that any attack on Macao would not be tolerated, and that a British vessel should be sent back to Macao.Bearing in mind the contents of your telegram 313 to Peking, I said that I understood that it was proposed that the boundary question should be referred either to the League of Nations or to arbitration. His Excellency said that he wanted the latter: an equal number of Portuguese and Chinese arbitrators and one other, whom he recognized had best be of other nationality than British, but who might be named by His Majesty&apos;s Government. He hoped the latter would insist on this arbitration. He feared an attack any clay on the colony, and the population were practically powerless to resist. It would take a very long time to send forces to Macao.The President begged me to lay the above considerations before you at once.On the same day Lord Curzon informed [No. 316] Sir Beilby Alston, in Peking, that the Portuguese Government had stated that the Canton Government had officially demanded inter alia : (1) Satisfaction from the Portuguese consul for a transgression (which had nevertaken place) of the maritime limits by Portuguese soldiers. (2) Punishment of the guilty Portuguese.
(3) Guarantees that the Macao Government vessels would not go beyond the line-down the -middle of the interior harbour, (4) The immediate removal of the defence works at Portas do Cerco (on.Portuguese territory). (5) The immediate removal of the lighting arrangements near Portas do Cefco. They stated that the Chinese torpedo boat had been joined by Chinese gunboats,, and that they were reliably informed that 3,000 men had been concentrated at Chin-San.The Portuguese Government requested British mediation in the incident of 16th September and- in the settlement of the boundary question. Failing its. acceptance by the Canton Government, the Portuguese Government said that they must resort to force and enquired what support they might depend on from Great Britain.In reply to this, Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed [No. 389] on 17th October to the following effect: The Canton authorities seemed anxious to force an issue with the treaty Powers in order to advertise their own claims to recognition, and for this purpose to have selected the Macao question. Should we intervene we should therefore make it clear that our object is not so much to defend the Portuguese as to resist the Cantonese attempt to prejudge a question which concerns China as a whole.As a matter of fact, information went to show that a deadlock exists, we having reached the limit of our good offices, and the only alternatives appeared to be either - to leave the Portuguese and the Chinese to settle the matter as best they could, or, pending the establishment of a rmified Chinese Government, to protect Macao against-the use of actual force in order to maintain the status quo ante 16th September.GERMANY.Silesia. On 14th October Lord Curzon informed [No. 231] Lord d&apos;Abernon that he had seen the German Ambassador and had told him that the decision about Silesia, as now more correctly reported, was in his opinion-much less unfavourable to Germany than had been believed. The fact that it had been unanimously approved by&quot; the Council of the League, including the British representative of which he had not then been aware showed that the decision must have positive merits. Further, it would be surprising if the proposals about the future control, giving an equal voice to the German Silesians with the Polish Silesians, did not, in view of the national characteristics of the two peoples, ensure to Germany a preponderant influence on the economic and industrial future of the region. If he were a German he should make the best of it.MEXICO.Diplomatic Move. -Telegraphing [No. 99] from Mexico on 11th October, Mr. Cummins reported that the Mexican Foreign Office was about to make some-important appointments, his authority being an inspired paragraph which had appeared in the press. One oE his colleagues had learnt secretly that it was proposed to send Senor Pani to Paris as Minister,, and then to claim French recognition of the Obregon administration. The Mexican Government felt that as the French Government had previously accepted Senor Pani as Minister and given him a decoration he could hardly be rejected as a persona non grata.PANAMA.Unemployment of British Subjects-On 6th and 7th October Mr. Graham telegraphed [Nos. 32, 33, 34] from Panama as follows :-Serious unemployment affecting about 7,000 West Indians, mostly British, has arisen on the isthmus as the result of the wholesale dismissal of silver employees by the Panama Canal Government. Local means of relief are being organized, but are entirely insufficient and of a temporary character. The proportion of unemployed from the. various colonies is approximately : Barbadoes, 45&apos; per cent. ; Jamaica, 30 per cent.; Trinidad, 5 per cent.; St. Lucia, 2 per cent.; Leeward Islands, 5 per cent.; the remainder being French West Indians and natives of Panama.
I am issuing a form with a view to securing returns of the numbers and other details,&apos; but suggest that the colouial Governments be approached immediately with a view to ascertaining their views on this problem, which is likely to prove grave in the near future. *I have, together with my French colleague, had a long conversation with the Acting-Governor of the Canal zone upon the situation, from which it appears that the Canal Government themselves admit that 20,000 persons, including dependants, are without means of subsistence in consequence of the dismissals of the silver employees by the United States authorities.No immediate relief is available excepting an offer to place not more than 200 families on, a settlement at Las Cascaclas in the Canal zone, and a proposal to employ in the immediate future and at reduced wages about 1,000 men on clearing operations in the forests. The Republic of Panama has neither funds nor work with which to render assistance.I understand that the Governor of the Panama Canal, now on leave in Washington, is discussing-the general problem.with the United States Government, and that the chairman of the special Panama Canal commission is interested in a scheme for providing lots along the line of canal. The situation, however, requires a much more immediate and comprehensive solution than appears to be contemplated from the information I can obtain.I venture to suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington be requested to. press the United States Government, while the matter is still under consideration, for a solution on the following lines : First. Extended provision of temporary works, either of clearing or of some Other suitable character by the canal, at fair rates of wages.Secondly. Facilities, where required, for repatriation, covering not only individual workmen but their dependants, as far as these are not already provided for by deposit of passage money or by contract.Thirdly. If necessary, and as arrangements can be made with the colonial Government for the reception of workmen and families, that shipping-facilities be provided by the United States Government. This is important in view of the difficulty of securing accommodation by the regular shipping lines and the exorbitant fares for West Indians.My French colleague is telegraphing in a similar sense to his Government, urging similar action in regard to the French West Indians on the part of the French Embassy at Washington.PERSIA.New Cabinet.--On 10th October Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 566] that the Prime Minister had reconstructed the Cabinet as follows : Prime Minister   - - Minister of Interior.Sardar Sepah      - -     - War.Amides Saltaneh - - Justice.Shahab-ed-Dowleh - Posts and Telegraphs.AmirAalam       - - Education.&apos;Mussadighes Saltaneh     - Finance.Moshares Saltaneh - Foreign Affairs.-Naires Sultan      - - Public Works.South Persia Rifles [F.C.R., liii, p. 7]. Replying to Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s telegrams of 1st and 2nd October the Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 400] to him on 6th October that he was prepared to sanction the purchase by the Persian Government of the arms and munitions referred to in those telegrams for the purpose of maintaining order in Fars.Mr. Bridgeman was instructed to point out to the Persian Prime Minister, when informing him. of this concession, that the recent attitude of his Government and Persian public opinion militated against our readiness to oblige, and that should further favours be sought from Great Britain a complete change was very desirable.Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 568] on 12th October that he had communicated the substance of the above instructions to the new Minister for Foreign Affairs in acknowledging his note expressing his friendly intentions.   The Minister had informed 33-3 B
him that his Government intended to do all they could to restore the good feeling of the country towards Great1 Britain, of whose deep-seated friendship he was personally convinced. He had begged for some opportune action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government as an earnest of their desire to assist Persia, and had referred to the difficulty of influencing public opinion in a friendly direction when arms and equip-ment, badly needed hy the Persian Government for the maintenance of order in the : south, were being destroyed by the order of His Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government.Mr. Bridgeman had called the Ministers attention to the fact that the sale of 700 rifles for Pars had been.sanctioned, and undertook to request authority for the further sale of arms. This he had done, and now reiterated his view that more harm would be done by destroying or removing 3,000 rifles than by selling them to the Persian Government for the protection of the trade routes of the south.Telegraphing [No. 575] again on the same subject on 14th October, Mr. Bridgeman gave the substance of the Prime Ministers reply to the foregoing communication in compliance with a request from the latter-. This was to the effect that the authorized amount of arms and equipment to be sold did not meet the requirements of the Persian Government for the maintenance of order in Pars and Kerman, and a request for a further amount was renewed. The Prime Ministers note conveyed an assurance of the desire of the present Government to improve and maintain friendly relations between the two Governments, and that efforts in this direction were being, and would ,still be, made, and further begged the necessary assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government to attain the objects in view.On 15th October the Secretary of State sent a. telegram [No. 409] to Mr. Bridge-man, which crossed the above, saying that in spite of the assurances of the Persian Government as reported by Mr. Bridgeman [No. 568], he adhered to the decision already communicated to him.Telegraphing [No. 412] again on 18th October with reference to Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s telegram [No. 575] of 15th October, the Secretary of State informed him that no confidence was entertained in the assurances proffered by the Persian Prime Minister. These were known to be inconsistent with facts, and in the programme submitted to Parliament by him he had declared his intention of obtaining assistance from other sources. The Secretary of State pointed out that a Government, who were looking for Swedes and Americans to replace the British military and financial advisers with whose services they had just dispensed ; who were making every endeavour to enlist American assistance; and who were wrongfully trying to dispose of railway and oil concessions, could not seriously suppose that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to accept mere paper assurances as to &quot; consolidation and improvement of friendly relations.&quot;Agreement with Russia. On 16th October Mr. Bridgeman sent [No. 576] the information that the Persian Government was expecting shortly to commence negotiations for a commercial agreement with Russia. The latter desired that these should take place in Moscow, but Teheran was preferred by the Persian Government. The conclusion of treaties dealing with posts and telegraphs and with extradition were also under consideration.POLAND.Silesia. Mr. Max Midler telegraphed [No. 412] as follows on 16th October: . The recommendations of the League of Nations respecting Upper Silesia so far as known here have been received with complacency, if not with actual satisfaction.The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that he was well content; he had , expected a less favourable decision and regarded the award as a reasonable compromise. He said, however, that he would not like his opinion to become generally known, and appeared surprised when I replied that it was the duty of the Polish Government to proclaim it* on the house tops and thus give a lead to public opinion. .,His predecessor, Prince Sapieha, who I saw yesterday, was also well satisfied, and I gather that this is the attitude of the Government as a whole, and of the official classes aiid of the majority of the intelligent public, which rejoice at a satisfactory termination of a long period of suspense.-There is, however, anxiety in financial and commercial circles lest the division of the industrial area may have an adverse effect on the chemical, mining and iron industries of Poland.
PORTUGAL.Recent Legislation and British Interests. The following telegram [No. 98] was sent from Lisbon by Sir Lancelot Carnegie on 1.2th October: I took the opportunity of my visit to the President of the Republic to express my regret that recent legislation in Portugal was likely to prove so prejudicial to British interests. I mentioned the laws respecting emigrants, shipping dues in Portuguese continental and colonial ports, banks and exchange and payment of import duties in gold. .1 said that, while not questioning the rights of the Portuguese Government to pass these laws, I would remind him that as most of the commerce with this country and the shipping that visited it were British, my compatriots were chiefly affected ; they were consequently discontented, and commercial relations between the two countries might sufferr There was also the tramway question; if this important British concern was ruined by the Lisbon municipality a deplorable, effect would be (? produced) in England.The President listened to me attentively, and said that he would ask the Prime Minister to discuss these matters with me.Macao. See under &quot; China.&quot;. RUSSIA.Siberia.Communist Plot. Telegraphing [No. 406] from Tokyo on 17th October, Sir Charles Eliot reported that the following had been received on the 16th from VladivostokA communist plot to overthrow the Vladivostok Government having been discovered, many arrests have been made and martial law declared, although there have been no disturbances in (? the town). During the past few days partisans have resumed their activities and have made attacks on the militia under the de facto Government and the Japanese detachments in the region between Nikolsk and (?Spassk).SWEDEN.New Cabinet.-Oa 12th October .Mr. Barclay telegraphed [No. 151] the following, list of the new Cabinet, which was to take office next day : M. Branting - Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs.M. Akerman -        - &quot;     -        -   Justice.M. Hansson  -        -        -        -   Defence.M. Lindqvist - -        -   Social.M. Orne       -        -        -        -   Communications.M. Thorsson -        -        - Finance.M. Olsson    - Church and Education..M. Linders &apos;- Agriculture.M. Svensson - Commerce.MM. Sandier, Nothin, Schlyter       -  Ministers without Portfolio.TURKEY.The Greek Success.-On .14th October Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 674] that the general headquarters in Constantinople considered that the claims of the Greek command as regarded the extent of the losses inflicted on the Turks were exaggerated, although the attempts of the latter to cut the Greeks off from their base by the capture of Afioun Karahissar undoubtedly met with a decided check. He added that, while the Nationalist forces were not strong enough seriously to menace in the immediate future the Greek position on the Eskishehr-Afioun line, the capacity of the Greeks to maintain the present line throughout the winter depended on other factors not yet ascertainable.The Occupied Districts of Asia Minor. On 15th. October Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 677] the following text of amidentic telegram which the three allied High Commissioners had agreed to address ,to their respective Governments :-The allied High Commissioners have received a joint note from the Sublime Porte protesting formally against.the application of Greek laws in the occupied
districts of Asia Minor and against the substitution of an Hellenic administration for the Smyrna High Commissariat.The Ottoman Government maintain that these measures are not only directly contrary to the principles of international law and to the inalienable rights of Turkey,, but. are of a nature to create new complications in the Near East. Full responsibility for the serious consequences which might result is thrown on Greece. The Porte-begs that instructions may be sent to the allied representatives at Athens to make energetic representations to the Greek Government with a view to preventing the-application of the measures proposed.Greek Prohibition on Transportation of Internal Produce.-. Sir Harry Lamb telegraphed [No. 83] on 11th October the following report :-The military authorities have issued an order prohibiting all transportation of grain from the interior to Smyrna. The harvest has been everywhere abundant, and I am assured that one quarter of the available supply would be ample for all the requirements of the army, which is moreover mainly fed on-foreign flour, there being no mills of any importance up country. Similarly barley for the army is largely imported, the local kinds being better suited for malting than for feeding purposes. The prohibition is consequently vexatious, detrimental to the interests of the country and specifically to those of the leading British firms mainly concerned in this branch of trade.It is commonly attributed to the false economic theories prevailing, and especially to a desire to depreciate Turkish currency by not only stopping the exportation, but by forcing the importation of foreign flour.With reference to the above Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 684] on 17th October that his allied colleagues and he had agreed that day to recommend to their Governments that pressure be brought at Athens with a view to instructions being-sent to Smyrna to withdraw the prohibition.Commercial Situation in Smyrna. Sir Harry Lamb telegraphed [No. 89] from Smyrna as follows on 17th October : At a special meeting of the delegates of foreign Chambers of Commerce held at Smyrna on 14th October, it was decided to solicit the intervention of their respective Governments with a view to obtain the removal of restrictions, which together with the general absence of security in the interior are paralyzing the commerce of this place. [These restrictions apply to cattle, wool and other produce, as well as to cereals.
