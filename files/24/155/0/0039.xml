BULGARIA.Bolshevik Plot-On 23rd September Sir,Herbert,Bering, on a communication received by him from the Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, sent the following telegram:  The Rumanian Minister at Sofia has reported to his Government the discovery-of a Bolshevik plot in Bulgaria ^suborn the already discontented Greek troops in Thrace, andj that a large shipment of propaganda documents have been landed from Russia for distribution amongst them with a view to the encouragement of a revolution.Offer to Greek Government. Mr. Lindley sent the following telegram from Athens on 26th September: I learn that the Bulgarian Minister has offered the Greek Government Bulgarian support, for , the proposal. that Thrace,be,an autonomous Power,. The Greek Govern-menthave refused, as the acceptance&apos; would have compromised Greek claims.Attitude of Neutrality. Telegraphing from Sofia on 2nd October, Mr. Erskine made the following report: An official communique states that the Minister of Justice has been sent to tire southern, frontier to ensure the execution of. the Governments ,,instructions with regard to the observance of Jhe strictest neutrality, and that he has. also been instructed. to admit Turkish, Greek and Armenian refugees, who are arriving in large numbers.CHINA..Loan Proposals. Ou 19th September Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed as follows: The Peking Syndicate, acting on behalf of Marconi, are negotiating a loan with the Ministry of Communications as follows : -    ; ...The Chinese Government to issue, ostensibly to the Chinese and the foreign public, 50 to 60 million dollars 8 per cent., bonds at par, secured on the revenues of internal telegraphs and telephones, both wire and wireless.Marconi are to take these bonds on the following conditions: Rempval of the administration to Shanghai. A Chinese director-general to be appointed by the Ministry of Communications. A Board nominated by the bondholders to control effectually the administration, and to appoint a foreign departmental chief. Neither official to be appointed or removed without the approval of the Board.The Ministry also desire an immediate advance of 20 million dollars of the above, before the flotation of the whole loan, for the repayment of the Japanese telegraph loan, which matures next year.Unless the foreign control of the administration and of the funds is definitely provided for, and officially communicated by the Chinese Government&apos; to His Majesty&apos;s Government, I consider the suggested security illusory, and the loan contrary to consortium principles as providing a large sum of free money to be squandered. There must further be considered the question of opposition from other Powers ; and as regards wireless, the present negotiations between the company (groups omitted) to carry out the conclusions of the Washington experts agreed to by His Majesty&apos;s Government.A separate proposal for a loan has also been made to the Eastern Telegraph Company unknown to Marconi&apos;s.I suggest Mr. Isaacs be asked to call at the Foreign Office and. questioned as to the above.In reply to the foregoing the following message from the Foreign Office was sent to Sir Beilby on 29th September : Mr. Isaacs states that Marconi have been negotiating with Japanese and American interests for the joint control of the Peking wireless station.   The ultimate aim is the
EGYPT.Afghan Congratulations. Telegraphing on 22nd September, Lord Allenby sent the following message : The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Mahmud Tarsi at Bombay,.stating that he is leaving for Port Said by the S.S. Kaiser-i-ITinal, as Ambassador Extraordinary from the Emir of Afghanistan, to present congratulations on the attainment of independence by Egypt.The Egyptian Government have no previous knowledge of this, and wordd be grateful for any further information which could be supplied.GREECE. -   IThe Position at Athens,--On 19th September, before the King&apos;s abdication, , Mri &quot;Lindley telegraphed the following, short review of the position at Athens as .gathered through the best sources of information at his disposal: Internal. There is-no serious disorder in the country, although the quarrel between the Royalists and the Venizelists is as bitter as ever. The Prime Minister is doing his best to appoint capable; Venizelisfs to important positions, but the forces against him are powerful. The. King shows no sign of a desire to abdicate, and he will not be forced to,do so,, without civil war. . Soldiers who have returned are ashamed of themselves, and glad to go home quietly without any quest-ions asked. The large Moslem population is quiet and unmolested, but there is intrigue going on between them and the Kemalist-Bulgarian committees, and the Bolsheviks. The Slav and -Jewpopulations are.also involved in these intrigues,which leave the Greeks practi--cally unaffected. There is much discontent and inflammable material about, but it is -quite possible that it will not explode.Finance.-The forced loan is almost exhausted and the Government is without [foreign exchange. The. National Bank have abroad a million sterling in gold, recently sent.to New York to the account of the Bank of England (see Mr. Bentinck&apos;s telegram, No.: 439). This million is not - Government property, but the Govern-ment are confident they can finance absolutely necessary imports of flour and coal ior the next few months out of the proceeds of exports of tobacco and currants, It will not be possible to.do more than this without help. Note inflation has not been &quot;carried to absurd lengths, and is not being practised. Draft in open market stands -at about.220,.Army. The army is not a serious military force, but could be reformed into one with British assistance in a short time.Navy.-The, moral is satisfactory, but the ships lack most things which we -consider essential.    &apos;Refugees. There are now about 150,,000 in Greece, and Thrace,.and the numbers will no doubt be more than doubled.   The Powers appear, morally bound, after all their declarations regarding minorities in Turkey, to help financially.  Immediate -help is required, and if this question were taken vigorously in hand, it would do . :much to.keep the country.quiet!The Refugee Question. Mr. Lindley sent the following telegram on the 25th (September:-      -     i,-my information is that all Greekfships in Greek ports have i.been.requisitioned, /and Greek sliips in&apos;foreign ports, except in cases in which the Greek Government haveinternational control of all China&apos;s telegraph ,and wireless, systems., If the scheme materializes, French and perhaps German interests will be invited,.tp join-While these negotiations were proceeding, the Chinese Government approached the Peking Syndicate with the . proposals .mentioned in your telegram.   Marconi, while not really interested;in the financial proposals, had. not rejected them outright,- -as they might serve as a lever to secure the control of all China&apos;s telegraph systems. They were, therefore, continuing pourparlers, but if anything concrete resulted, were prepared to offer the financial, business to the consortium. Nothing would in any -case be done without consultation with the Foreign Office.   The proposed loan is-$40,003,000. ,   .       -.    ,. t  , , ,   ,x  .,        ,This explanation seems satisfactory, but please report your observations.
not been able to find the necessary foreign exchange. Ordinary traffic with the &quot;islands is completely suspended, ships being Used for transporting soldiers and refugees. The Greek Government have been afraid to send Greek &quot;ships to (? groups omitted) they will send them to Smyrna under the arrangement already reported. In short, I believe the Greek. Government are doing all they can, but I do not mean that a more efficient Government and people Could not do more with the means at. their disposal. , -It should be. remembered that these refugees are not Greek subjects, and very many thousands are not even Greek speaking. - In fact they are Christian minorities, whose protection has been the subject of Constant pledges on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government; the Greek Government, in agreeing to receive them, has already done more than any other Government.The Greek authorities are also doing their best to feed them when landed, but they have neither the means nor the organization to do so efficiently, and I fear that severe epidemics will break out unless a competent foreign organization takes charge-forthwith.It should be realized that the refugee question has not nearly reached its worst. Hundreds of thousands are still awaiting shipment from Asia Minor, and everything-points to enormous numbers leaving European Turkey. Americans here are doing, all they can and so is the British colony. Nothing serious need be expected of others.Views on the. Situation. The views entertained in Athens were reported by-Mr. Liudley on 25th September in. the following telegrams : Newspapers of all shades denounce the terms of the allied invitation to the-Kemalists as a betrayal of the promises made to Christians in Turkey, and as the-opening of a new era of war in the Balkans. Venizelist papers declare that Greece must resist the decisions of the Powers, and that M. Venizelos must return.A deputation of nine Thracian deputies called this morning to plead the cause, of . their countrymen. In reply to their question, I informed them that the proposals of the Powers must be regarded as definite, and that they must make up their minds that Thrace, up to the Maritza, was gone since no (group omitted) was prepared to go-to war to keep the Turks out of Europe, and they could not do it themselves. I said that it was madness to organize local resistance, which would merely ensure a disaster,, and it was to be presumed that the Powers would be able to prevent a repetition of the^ Smyrna tragedy in Europe. As regards a movement against the present regime which they put forward as a way out of their difficulties, I said that such movement meant, in my opinion, civil war, which was a greater disaster than any that had yet overtaken Greece, and would have no influence on the decision of the Powers. Ths Prime-Minister was known to be a patriotic man, and it was the duty of all Greeks to sink their differences and support him. /The Prime Minister called this morning in order to say that, Greece still looked&apos; upon Great Britain as her only friend, and hoped for her help,I told him what I had just said to the Thracian deputies, and he agreed that local resistance was madness, and that the Greek Government must bow to the decree of the Powers. He would accept the invitation to the conference as soon as he received, it, and if the Chamber, which meets in a few days&apos; time, did not agree he would resign. I explained to him the grave consequences which war with the Kemalists. would have had for Great Britain. He understood the position, and only regretted that the Greek Government had not realized it before.He said the Government were quite willing to use Yenizelos abroad, but the latter would not recognize the present regime, so there was nothing to be done. He then asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would,not recognize the King. Nothing-would do more to unite Greeks and give them the moral satisfaction they, so much needed. If the -King were recognized and facilities for a loan accorded, he had hopes, that Greece might.yet pull through.I said I would report what he had said to you, but that I thought it most unlikely that decisions on such serious matters would-be taken before the peace conference had. taken place.Events consequent on the King&apos;a Abdication. On 27th September Mr. Linclley telegraphed from Athens as follows : A Committee of three generals is in charge of the town pending the formation of a new Government, There has been no disorder to-day, and one regiment of revolu-tionary troops has arrived.   The movement appears to be becoming more markedly
Venizelist than it - was at first, it is yet too early to foresee on. what lines it will develop. There have been friendly demonstrations before His . Majesty&apos;s legation and probably others. .     .Supplementing the foregoing, Mr. Lindley sent the following telegram on 28th -September: I learned this morning that the military committee were in no hurry to form a regular Government, and desired first to try by court-martial and shoot a certain number of Gounaris&apos; Ministers.I asked Colonel Gonatas and Colonel Plastiras, who are in control of Athens, to call this afternoon, which they did. Having consulted those of my colleagues whom I could, reach, I informed them that judicial murders would produce very bad impression abroad, and used other arguments, drawn from; my &apos; experiences in Russia, to dissuade them. The French Minister, who was also present, backed me up with great eloquence, and finally, after we bad given the colonels permission to use our names, they, promised that ex-Ministers would not be tried, except by regular tribunal.   All others would be amnestied. .The French Minister and I then turned our guns on the question of forming a regular Government, aud the colonels said they must have Ministers agreeable to the Entente, and asked for suggestions. We declined to take the responsibility, and they then asked whether we had any objection to a number of names they read out. We had none, and I hope to-morrow there will be a regular Ministry with whom to deal, probably under M. Carapanos, a moderate and respected Venizelist. Before the French Minister arrived I had spoken of my fears for the safety of the Royal Family, and told the colonels that I considered it conducive to the prestige of a revolutionary Government if they themselves made all the arrangements for their safe departure at the earliest possible moment. This they promised to do, and I got in the chief of the British naval mission to help in the arrangements.I also sent the Netherlands Minister up to Tatoi to inform the King. I told the chief of the naval mission that if there was danger of serious delay, owing to difficulty of finding a destination for the Royal Family, he was to authorize their going to Malta provisionally, but was not to suggest it.   1 trust that this is approved.-New Government. Referring to the preceding telegram, Mr. Lindley telegraphed the following on 29th September : I understand from the colonels that a Government is being formed, as under :  M. Alexander Zaimis     -   Prime Minister.&apos;M&quot;. S. Crokidas   -        -   Acting as Prime Minister pending the arrival fromabroad of M. Zaimis, who is undergoing an operation, and Minister of the Interior.M. Politis -        -   Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Canellopoulos -   National Economy, and provisional Minister forForeign Affairs, pending the arrival of M. Politis from Paris.M. CJharalambis -        -   Minister of War.M. Papayantou   -        -   Minister of Marine.M. Vasileiou  -   -        -   Justice.M. Doxiades      -        -   Public Assistant.Doctor Siotis     -        -   Education.M. Kalligas       -        -   Communications,  Posts, and provisionally Agri-culture.M. Diomedes     -        -   Finance and Treasury. . M. Embericos-   -        -   Supplies. The Prime Minister is the former High Commissioner of Crete and Prime Minister on several occasions.A moderate  venizelist, M. Crokidas was Governor-General of Crete under M. Venizelos.M. Politis was Minister for Foreign Affairs under M. Venizelos. -M. Canellbpoulos was High Commissioner of Constantinople under M. Venizelos. The Minister of War and the Minister of Marine are not party men. The Minister of Justice is universally respected and moderate in his views. M. Kalligas was Minister of National Economy in 1917.   He is a moderate royalist. M. Diomedes was Minister of Finance under M. Venizelos.   He is a capable, man wdio favours monarchy for Greece.There may still be changes in this Cabinet.45-1 .B
GFollowing on his announcement of the new.Cabinet, Mr. Lindley. telegraphed as follows on 29th September.: It is a distinct step in advance that a regular Government has been formed,1 although I believe the revolutionary-committee of 12 officers, of whom Colonel Plastiras and Colonel Gonatas are spokesmen, still intend to exercise a kind of controlling authority. -      .....     ...The day has been perfectly quiet in Athens, but there are far too many soldiers in the town for the position to&apos; be secure. These may at any time wake up to the fact--that they have nmde the revolution and have the power.There has been no sign of the red Hag, and the Venizelist movement is less Evident than it was. I should say that the revolutionary committee are distinctly not Venizelist, but national, whilst the prominent, civilian element is almost entirely Venizelist.-Referring to his message of the previous day announcing the formation of a Cabinet, Mr. Lindley sent the.folio wing telegram on 30th September.- The new Ministers took the oath to. the King yesterday, except the Prime Minister, who has not yet arrived from Vienna.The revolutionary committee published to day the following decisions : -1. To hand over to the Government the right to promulgate Royal legislativedecrees. ...... -2. The Moslem populations of Macedonia and Thrace will constitute, at the approaching election, separate constituencies entitled to elect 19 representatives toparliament.A decree Will fix the distribution of these 19 seats among the constituencies according to the population, and will settle other-details.3. Those arrested before the formation of the Government as being responsible for the national disasters will remain in preventive arrest until the new national assembly shall decide in what way they can be quickest brought to trial.&apos;J&apos;lie Military Movement. Mr. Lindley sent the following report on 2nd October :  Colonel Plastiras, who is the real head of the military movement, called on me this mprningand asked if it,was true that the allied generals were to meet Kemal at Mudania to-morrow. I said that it was the desire of the allied generals to have the meeting, but, I was not yet sure that the other side would come. Colonel Plastiras then informed me that he was going to Thrace- to-night to try to reform the armythere. &apos; )\. j &apos;A number of officers had already been sent. Pie asked me what was to be the future of the province. I told him that His Majesty&apos;s Government were most anxious for peace, and that if Kemal accepted the . allied invitation to a conference it would be madness for the Greeks to refuse. Greece would have need of the Powers after the long war, aud would have a fine country left to her. She could not hope for assistance in putting her house in order unless she accepted the decisions of the Powers.Colonel Plastiras objected that, if Greece refused, she would be face to&apos;face with an enemy also weakened by war, and that the Greeks might well hold their own and even take Constantinople. I replied that the whole lesson of the last two years was that Greece could do nothing in the long run if isolated. Should she act as proposed, she would be just as isolated as she had been during these two years, and the result would be a real catastrophe for her.Colonel Piastiras admitted the force of these arguments and said that after aU he was not a political man. M. Veiiizelos understood the foreign situation and was the best judge. He would do what M. Venizelos advised in this matter, but he must lose no time in getting the army of Thrace into shape.I said that f thought a disciplined force was very necessary in Greece, because one never knew how far the successes of Kemal might have turned his head. An army might be required on the Maritza, and discipline was absolutely necessary in Thrace itself, in order to put an end to the massacres, and excesses of which I had already spoken to him, &quot;and which would do&apos; incalculable harm to the.Greek cause. Colonel Plastiras said that his first efforts would be directed to stopping this kind of thing, which he hated as much as I. .   .The impression left by the visit was that Colonel Plastiras is a real soldier, who will do all he can to put down disorder, and will take political advice from those in whom he has confidence. His personal courage, is a byword in the army, and I would sooner deal with him than any other Greek I have met.
HUNGARY.Government Attitude. Mr. Holiler reported by telegram from Budapest, on 2nd October, that, although the Government was naturally taking great interest in the near eastern situation, it was not their intention to make any sort of move in the matter.ITALY.Financial Help to Austria [F.O.R., Ixxviii, p. 2]. Telegraphing from Rome on 30th September, Sir Ronald Graham reported as follows : -A lengthy official communique appeared in the press this morning on financial help to Austria. It corrects the statement that Italy was responsible for reference to the League of Nations. She only adhered to M. Poincare&apos;s proposal rather than assume the onus of putting forward an alternative. It explains that Italy has not renounced her reparations credits on Austria, as has been asserted. She and all the other States have only consented to postpone payment for a. period.FinaUy, after explaining the nature of the present League proposals, it announces that the Council of Ministers yesterday agreed to instruct the Italian Legation that Italy does not refuse in principle to share in the guarantee on same scale as the other great Powers, but that she is not able to accept the proposed system of control. She asks, instead, that the control be exercised by the Powers directly interested, and that in the commission of the control she should have a place corresponding to her position, not only as a great Power, but above all as the principal creditor of Austria.JAPAN.Failure of the Changchun Conference [F.C.R., Ixxviii, p. 0]. On 27th September Sir Charles Eliot sent the following telegram : The Japanese communique respecting the collapse of negotiations with the Soviet has doubtless been published in the press. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the rupture as final, and says that the Russians had no intention of making an agreement, and that their real object was to discredit the Japanese, and to make it appear that by refusing to evacuate Saghalien they rendered further discussion impossible.Telegraphing from Peking on 28th Septembor, Sir Beilby Alston reported as follows : The rupture on the subject of northern Saghalien is confirmed. The Russians demanded immediate evacuation. The Japanese promised to evacuate only after the settlement of the Nicolaieff question.The Position in Siberia [F.C.R., lxxviii, p. 5]. On 27th September Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed as follows : The conference at Changchun having broken down, the position at Vladivostock may be difficult. His Majesty&apos;s Consul asks for a ship by 15th October, and the admiral proposes to send the Carlisle. The Japanese are sending one additional ship and four destroyers. The Japanese have suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Consul privately joint consular action for the protection of foreigners, meaning presumably a board which will make requests to the naval authorities. The Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; agrees to this, and also to the limitation of the board to the Consuls of Great Britain, China, the United States and Japan, as a body comprising the Consuls of all the small Powers would be unwieldy. I am jnovisionally authorizing the Consuls to act accordingly.On the same date Sir Charles sent the following message :  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has only received vague reports about -ammunition having already reached Chang Tsodin from Russia, but he admits that the Russians will probably sell him the ammunition now in Vladivostock. He would be glad to prevent this, but asks what can be clone. The present intention of the . Japanese Government is to hand over the ammunition to whatever Russian Government is in power when they complete evacuation.In a subsequent telegram on the same day, Sir Charles Eliot reported the &quot; recommendation of His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Vladivostock that the ammunition should 45-1 , 0
be put under the guard of men. from, foreign&apos; ships of war. The local Japanese authorities had agreed to . this, but the united States Ambassador was in strong opposition to the proprjsali&quot;Owing&quot; to the failure of &quot;negotiations.it. was suggested that the Japanese might consent to its destruction by throwing it into the sea.:Tor two reasons, the military authorities at Tokyo, as reported by our Military Attache, were opposed to this suggestion ; (1) that as the ammunition was held in trust by Japan,, they must hand it over to a Russian authority; (2) much labour &quot;and time-would be involved by getting rid of it in the sea: .       -In reply to Sir Charles Eliofs reports the following instructions were telegraphed;.to him on 3rd October :- .... ..;Please make strong representations to the Japanese Government in conjunction -with your United States colleague. We are also opposed to the proposal for landing ati international guard. ...The United States Government is being urged to send similar instructions to the United States Ambassador,: Tokyo.; LITHUANIA.Cabinet Changes [F-OiR., hrii, p. 2]. Telegraphing from Kovno on 1st October, Mr. Dilley sent the following report :-The Minister for Foreign Affairs resigned on 29th September as he has been &quot;appointed Director of the Emission ; Bank. M. Galvanauskas will act as Foreign Minister until after the elections.PERSIA.The Cabinet and the Press [F.C.R., lxxviii, p. 6]. Sir Percy Loraine sent the following telegram from Teheran on 24th September: The press was released several days ago by the Minister of War without consulting the Prime Minister, whose intention was to maintain the suppression until the press law has been passed. The result has been-an anti-British outburst, as spiteful as the one previously complained of.1 saw the Prime Minister and told him that I regarded the situation as very &quot;grave, and that unless he could stop the campaign I should have to. reconsider my whole attitude towards the Persian Government. (I added privately that I was by no means sure whether I should be.allowed to remain here if the text of these articles reached London.) I hoped that he would not compel me to place the matter in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government and report that my own representations were disregarded and the Persian Government was unable to protect the dignity of my country.His Highness has promised me to have the press law passed in a week, and will submit for my approval the text of the Persian Governments communique to the press on the lines previously suggested.&apos;Anglo-American Oil Concessions [F.OR,, Ixxviii, p. 6]. On 23rd September Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed as follows : The Prime Minister -has now presented the Medjliss with a fresh set of proposals, in which he has combined the points most favourable to the Persian Government in the conditions offered by the Standard Oil Company and SinclaiFs respectively.- He seeks authority to negotiate on this new basis with any American company.POLAND. &apos;Conference at Warsaw. The following telegram was sent by Sir William Max Muller on 24th September ; - ,   : . .The conference of military experts from Poland, Rumania, Finland, Latvia and Esthonia sat on Friday and yesterday. The Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me that complete unanimity was finally attained, and the experts agreed to recommend to their Governments that they should all support at.the Moscow conference the signature of a pact of non-aggression, as any agreement for disarmament or limitation of forces
would be too dangerous for certain of the countries involved, especially Poland, and would be impossible of enforcement in Russia.The. Minister for Foreign Affairs told me he hoped to attend a meeting of the four foreign Ministers to be held at Revel probably on 5th October.The meeting was one of the periodical meetings agreed upon at Warsaw in March to discuss questions of common interest to the four countries, and promised by the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Finnish Government, although for internal reasons still unable to ratify the&quot; Warsaw agreement of 17th March, were willing to collaborate with the other Governments.The principal object of the Revel conference would be the confirmation of the recommendations of the conference of the military experts, and the adoption of a common attitude towards the Russian disarmament proposals.The Warsaw, agreement was ratified by the Polish Diet on 22nd September.RUMANIA.Government Policy. Sir Herbert Dering sent the following telegram on 22nd September: The following further communique has appeared in the Government organs :  &quot; The victory of the Kemalists reopens the question of the Straits and of the balance of power in the Balkans. Rumania has in this connexion two clearly defined interests-(1) The need to see the assurance of the liberty and internationalization of the Straits; (2) the need to see peace in the Balkans is maintained, because it is clear that a new Balkan conflagration can have the gravest repercussion, and can put in question again all treaties on which the European situation created by the world war is based.In the circumstances of course Rumanian policy must be guided by the necessity for safeguarding these two interests. But naturally Rumania cannot pursue their realization except in common accord with her great Allies, and animated always by the most peaceful sentiments.&quot;TRANSCAUCASIA.Protest from the Republics. The following protest was received from M. Mdivani, who telegraphed from Moscow on 27th September : Le conseil federal des republiques transcaucasiennes proteste par la presente contre la reunion d&apos;une conference destinee a resoudre la question du proche orient, et particulierement la question des detroits, sans la participation des etats, que cette question interesse particulieremeut. Le conseil federal des republiques trans-caucasiennes se joint entierement a la note du gouvernement russe du 24 Septembre et declare que, d&apos;accord encela avec la Russie, 1&apos;Azerbeidjan, 1&apos;Armenie et la Georgie ne reconnaitront aucune decision touchant les detroits, qui serait prise sans la collaboration des republiques transcaucasiennes et a 1&apos;encontre de leurs interets.Le president du conseil des commissaires du peuple et commissaire du peuple pour les affaires etraugeres de TAzerbeidjan, Narimanoff. Le president du conseil de commissaires du peuple et commissaire clu peuple pour les affaires etrangeres de 1&apos;Armenie, Miasnikoff. Le president du conseil de commissaires clu peuple et commissaire du peuple pour les affaires etrangeres de la Georgie.TURKEY.National Position. Telegraphing on 1st October, Sir Horace Rumbold reported ;as follows: -In an interview published on 29th September, the Grand Vizier stated, in reply to the question about the position as between Constantinople and Anatolia (sic), that there was no duality in the nation, that the difference hitherto existing was a matter of&apos; outward form, and that he hoped that even this would shortly disappear. He replied vaguely to the question as to whether the central Government would send repre-:sentatives to the conference, and what their line would be, merely saying that every -effort would be made to uphold the legitimate claims of Turkey.
Certain reports credit the Grand Vizier with the intention of definitely recognizing the exclusive right of Angora to represent Turkey at the conference, hat nothing which I have observed myself&apos;supports this.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Scrapping of Battleships-Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed the following report on 26th September:  The Secretary of the Navy has issued a statement to the effect that there will be ho scrapping of battleships until the naval treaty has been ratified by all the signatory Powers. Five obsolete battleships Virginia, Rhode&apos; Island, Nebraska, Georgia and New Jersey are being scrapped, but it is explained that, although mentioned in the treaty, they would in any case have been condemned. The impression seems to-prevail that the near East disturbances may make European Powers reluctant to begin scrapping.
