FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Mission to England. The Secretary of State for India informed [3875] the-Viceroy on 1st August that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, in accordance with instructions telegraphed to him on 9th July, had conveyed an invitation to the Afghan Envoy to visit England. The Envoy had evinced pleasure at receiving this invitation. ^ -On 10th August the Viceroy was notified of the arrival of the Afghan mission on. 8th August. The mission were the bearers of two letters. One, an autograph letter from the Amir to His Majesty the King, confirming the announcement of the death of the.Amir&apos;s father and of his own accession, and expressing sentiments of friendship towards His Majesty and the desire to establish friendly relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The other, from Tarsi to Lord Curzon to the same general effect. Both announced the appointment of Wali Khan as Ambassador Extraordinary and Envoy Plenipotentiary in London. Wali Khan declined to have any relations with the Secretary of State for India and insisted on his instructions to present his letters only through the medium of Lord Curzon. It was indicated that the real object of the mission was to establish direct relations with the Foreign Office. The question awaits consideration.ALBANIA.Attitude of Greece. Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 461] on 20th August that having seen reports in the newspapers of the Albanian mobilization and the renewed persecution of Greeks, he had asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and. the Minister of Wat what information they had. They both said that they had not much infor-mation, but that in any case they did not mean to be drawn into having another front at present. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that&quot;it was true that the Albanians were carrying out a full mobilization, and were persecuting the Greeks in a monstrous way. The Minister of War said that the Albanians were mobilizing against the Serbians, not against Greece, and that he had no information about the persecution of the Greeks. He added that he had some 15,000 men in Epirus, and was quite safe if warfare should ensue, which he did not expect and meant to avoid. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he gathered that the Serbians were helping the Mirdites.ARGENTINE.Mr. Ginnell. Mr. Macleay telegraphed [No. 129] from Buenos Aires on 19th August that Mr. Ginnell had been received in. a private capacity the previous morning by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Ministry. No notice of the interview had appeared so far in the papers, but he learned from a friendly American correspondent who was informed of the reception by Mrs. Ginnell, that on his enquiry if any presentation of credentials had been made, she replied that no credentials had been accepted. From this his informant concluded that Mr. Ginnell had shown his credentials to the Minister.He attributed the conduct of the Argentine Government in this matter to the desire of the President to win the votes of the Irish Argentine community at the presidential election next year.BRAZIL.Internal Troubles. Reporting [No. 147] on 18th August, Sir John Tilley sent the-following: In the State of Pernambuco all stores have been shut since 15th August in protest against the new budget, and feeling is running high there and in the interior.
Fearing disorders in the interior, the Government is sending troops. In order to-further paralyze commerce, and incidentally to prevent or delay the arrival of troops, railway lines have been taken up, trains derailed and some, damage done. All taffic has been stopped, but the damage is being repaired as quickly as possible. Telegraph wires have been cut in several (group om.permitted)s and news from the interior is not forthcoming, but the damage is believed not to be considerable as yet.GERMANY.Adjournment of the Reichstag [F.C.R., xlvii, p. 4]. The following telegram -[No. 428] was sent by Lord D&apos;Abernon from Berlin on 23rd August:  The meeting of the Reichstag has been postponed from Gth to 27th September. The main cause of the postponement is to allow further time for the discussion of the tax programme by the Cabinet.-Silesia.German View of the Situation. Lord D&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No. 418] the following account on 16th August: I had a long conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning. Although he complained of the great loss to Germany and to Upper -Silesia involved in the postponement of the Upper Silesian decision, it is easy to see that the German Government is in reality gratified by the results attained in Paris, and is particularly grateful for the fair attitude adopted by England. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that his own position in the Cabinet, and that of those who advocated reliance on England as the only policy, had been immensely strengthened by the Paris conference.As regards order in Upper Silesia the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had no special reason for preoccupation. The German Government was doing every-thing it could to keep the German section quiet, and would continue to do so. They were sending a new German Minister to Warsaw, Herr von Schoen, and had given him instructions to observe a friendly attitude, and to listen to any proposals which might be made from the Polish side for improved commercial relations . between the two countries. The German Government would also be ready to agree to very favourable terms for Poland regarding the produce of the industrial section of Upper Silesia if awarded to Germany.Regarding the removal of sanctions, Doctor Rosen expressed apprehension at the alleged fact that the French agreement to the withdrawal of the Rhine customs barrier was dependent on the free entry into Germany of French wines, spirits and luxuries. I pointed out to him that the latter&apos;s documents did not stipulate anything of the kind, and on reference to the documents he agreed that his apprehensions on this score had perhaps been premature; there were, however, a great many conditions attached to the French withdrawal of the customs barrier, and these would diminish the good effect in Germany.With regard to the withdrawal of the troops of. occupation from Dusseldorf, Duisburg and Ruhrort, I drew his attention to Lord Curzon&apos;s speech on Saturday -which appeared to have been insufficiently reported in the German Press. Doctor Rosen replied : &quot; The French will never agree to the withdrawal of these troops of occupa-tion; what they want is German territory, and they will never be satisfied until they get it. That is the French policy to-day as it was under Louis XV.&quot; He did not believe it would be possible for Monsieur Briand to withdraw the French troops, even if personally convinced such a step was desirable.Discussing a possible change of government in France, Doctor Rosen said : &quot; To us it is a matter of indifference whether Monsieur Briand stands or falls. There is no good in Monsieur Briand&apos;s words accompanied by Monsieur Poincare&apos;s acts. Even if Monsieur Briand was succeeded by the devil, I would just as soon take the chance. We have a German saying, &apos;a sharp frost does not last long,&apos; and I do not think that a Poincare or Barthou Ministry could last many months.&quot; ;&apos; He concluded by urging that the Commissions of Control should be withdrawn at the earliest date. Constant incidents between foreign officers and the German population were occurring and were almost certain to continue to occur. The presence of foreign officers in large numbers was galling to German feeling. The German Government and the German people were deeply grateful to the Prime Minister for his speech on this subject at the Paris Conference.
The Work of the Commission [F.C.R., xlyix, p. 5].-On 19th August General Sir William Heneker telegraphed [No. 337] as follows : -There is no disturbance to report. Lukaschek and Rymer as well as Count Pra appeared before the commission yesterday. The two first-named have drawn up a joint proclamation to the people of Upper Silesia which is satisfactory, and counsels-peace and quietness while waiting for the decision. The two main matters engaging attention now are the return of fugitives to their homes and the economic and unemployment questions with which is merged the matter of the Upper Silesia-Polish frontier. All three of the above-mentioned gentlemen consider this frontier ought to be open for certain exports from Upper Silesia.   Rymer was especially emphatic.Major Williams&apos;is dealing with the fugitive camps and is working in Conjunction with a mixed German-Polish Committee which has the matter in hand. The camps are costly even now, but in the winter will be doubly so; disease is appearing owing to their being insanitary, and the sooner they can be cleared the better. The Germans are doing a great deal of work endeavouring to gain over the Poles in the country, and are succeeding to an appreciable extent.After the last rising Korfanty failed in very many instances to pay his followers in Upper Silesia ; the Germans are now paying these men the sums which Korfanty owes them. The German Government also proposes to pay an indemnity to certain people wdio suffered owing to the last insurrection, Poles and Germans equally. It amounts to from 000 to 750 marks per month per person according to status for the months of May and June. It applies only to state officials and employes. All this is. producing a decided effect, and the Poles are comparing German with Polish.methods, to the detriment of the latter.GREECE.The Campaign in Asia Minor [F.C.R., xlix, p. 5]. On 10th August. Lord. Granville sent the following telegram [No. 447]: -The Minister of War told the press with reference to the rumours that Kemal is seeking allied mediation that it must be distinctly understood that the Greek Government would not. &quot; repeat the fault made in 19.18 when the Allies concluded the armistice with Turkey at Mudros. We shall demand and obtain such guarantees as shall make it impossible for the enemy to perjure themselves again. We shall also insure a liberated people against a return of tyranny.&quot;A further telegram [No. 450] from Lord Granville, dated 12th August, reported as follows :-One newspaper, referring to the Greek Governments military administration of the interior zone of Asia Minor, remarked that Greece would not be hampered there by capitulations. I asked the Minister for Foreign - Affairs about this yesterday, expressing the hope that it was not true that such a step was contemplated, as it would certainly lead to protests; he said he was sure it was not true, but advised me to ask the Minister of War, which I did to-day. The Minister of War assured me that there was no question of abolishing capitulations or of making any change in the method of government; the territory had become too big to be administered by the High Commissioner at Smyrna, who had not enough personnel, and -igeneral head-quarters had no time for such administration. General Vlachopoulos had been chosen because he had experience of similar procedure when he was on the staff of Prince Nicolas at the time of the condominium by the Balkan States at Salonica. His choice was also convenient as it was desired to give an army corps to Prince Andrew, who had done very well in command of his division.The Minister of War repeated to me what he told the Military Attache yesterday. He thought it possible that the Turks would stand beyond the river Sakharia, but not very likely, as he thought there was little fight left in them. He believed that a third, of their total artillery had been captured, including almost all their heavy guns, and that their numbers had been reduced by half, chiefly by desertions. He expressed .both in words and manner the most complete confidence.He declared that political reunion at the front had made giant strides, which had been much helped .by the King&apos;s distributing decorations in person regardless of political opinions. The King had been to Kutahia for a few days, but had now returned to Eskishehr.
Future Policy. In reply to an enquiry, from the Foreign Office, Lord Granville on 17th August sent the following telegram [No. 456]: I saw the President of the&apos;: Council this morning for the first time, on the excuse of a question connected with the Naval Mission. In the course of conversation I asked him, stating that I had no instructions&quot;to do so, if the Greek Government had any definite ideas which he could tell me as to the future. Fie said they were waiting for the final result of the campaign, aud that then their military advisers must determine what would be -necessary for their security it was a military question. I said that it was also a political question, and I would venture to advise him to be as moderate as possible, and not to try to take too much. He said he entirely agreed, and that from the national point of view they would desire to take the least possible territory, but that they must be guided to a great extent by what the soldiers decided to be an easily defensible frontier.   He spoke with the greatest seriousness and good sense.Instructious on this subject were telegraphed [No. 240] from the Foreign Office to Lord Granville on 17th August as follows : Continued rumours and reports of Greek ambitions with regard to Constantinople seem to render it desirable that on a suitable occasion you should repeat with even greater emphasis your warning that the Greek Government is exceedingly ill-advised to indulge in these ambitions, and will not be permitted to gratify them.In the debate in the House of Commons yesterday, Mr. Asquith, speaking for the Liberal party, deplored the continued fighting between the Greehs and the Turks as a blot and a scandal, pursued for no world-purposes or great ideals. Mr. Shaw, speaking on behalf of the Labour party, was no -less explicit. The attitude of these spokesmen of the two branches of Liberal opinion show that Greece, if she pitches her expectations too high, will run the risk of alienating all her friends in this country.HUNGARY.Serbian Evacuation of Baranya. Mr. Holder telegraphed [No. 208] from Budapest on 10th August that the Hungarian Government had informed him that the Serb-Hungarian Republic of Baranya had been proclaimed at Pecs on . 14th August, but that the Government did not recognize it; also that sweeping impositions were being levied at Baia under Serbian auspices.On the other hand the Serbian Minister had read to him that morning a telegram from his Government, saying that orders had been given to the Serbian authorities to prepare for. evacuation, but the Serbian Government were gravely anxious as to the feelings of the people, which were violently opposed to the return to Hungarian rule/so that bloodshed was to be apprehended. He had replied that this would be infinitely regrettable, but that the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors. must be obeyed, and their programme carried out to the letter, both in Baranya and in Comitats. He found that his colleague had iised similar language to him, and they had now addressed to him a note in that sense, in virtue of the decision of the Conference which authorized them to deal direct with the Serbian Government.In succeeding telegrams [Nos. 209 and 210] of the same elate Mr. Hohler reported the receipt of telegrams from Colonel Gosset from Pecs, in which the latter had reported that Colonel Georgevitch, commanding the Serbian troops, was still without powers over the civilian authorities to order evacuation. Colonel Gosset feared that an independent republic might mean trouble after the evacuation if it were delayed, and pressed for the maintenance of the specified date-18th August. Colonel Georgevitch, whom Colonel -Gosset considered honest, would take no responsibility, and wrould take no action whatever without detailed instructions from Belgrade. In his second telegram Colonel Gosset had stated his belief that the Serbians hoped that one more push would achieve the desired resultsTelegraphing [No. 211] on 17th August, Mr. Hohler reported as follows : I have just had telephonic communication with Colonel Gosset. He says that neither civil nor military authorities have yet received instructions to evacuate. He attributes no importance to the formation of a republic, or to socialist talk, but thinks the Hungarians will be welcome when they enter. He is afraid, however, lest the Serbs may suddenly make a bolt and that the socialists may do much harm before the Hungarians can arrive. The Serbian authorities at (group undecypherable)-thria 31-4 &apos; B &apos; &apos; .
and Szegedin are without orders. None of the Hungarian Commissioners sent to take oxer the administration are recognized by the Serbs. The latter have begun to-carry off certain Italian machinery from Bares but he is trying to stop this. He thinks the Hungarians had better continue the preliminary concentration as at present.I and my colleagues foresee most serious prospects unless the allied Powers can make the Serbs immediately give orders for evacuation; failing this, Comitat arrangements also will fall to the ground.On 19th August Mr. Hohler sent the following telegram [No. 214]:  . Colonel Gosset reports this afternoon that Colonel Georgevitch had stated that if the Hungarian forces crossed the line to-day (as laid down by the programme of the Conference of Ambassadors) he would resist them by force. Colonel Gosset con-sequently saw no alternative, in order to prevent, a conflict, but to grant a delay of 48 hours, although he said that he was very unwilling to do this as it would give so much extra time for the development of communist intrigues. I and my colleagues have sanctioned the delay and are informing the Hungarian Government accordingly.As, however, the instructions of the Conference of Ambassadors were to the effect that the evacuation of Baranya was to be anterior to that of Comitats, we are informing the Hungarian Government that the evacuation of the latter will be delayed as many days as is that of the former. We are further informing the Hungarian Government that while granting the delay of 48 hours, in any case the line must not be crossed without previous constdtation with Colonel Gpsset and with his approval.We think the prolongation of this situation undesirable in the highest degree and are requesting our respective Governments to make very energetic representations at Belgrade. , .. &apos; - -Late in the evening of the same date Mr. Hohler was able to telegraph [No 21.7] as follows : -The Serbian Minister has just (? group omitted) us that the Serbian Government has issued orders for imrirediate evacuation.Mr. Hohler reported [No. 220] the-receipt of a message from Colonel Gosset that morning, 20th August, stating that the situation was quiet. The Serbian evacuation of Baranya had taken place, and included communist refugees and most Russians.[See also rinder &quot; Serbia.&quot;]JAPAN.Kobe Labour Troubles. Sir Charles Eliot sent the following telegram [No. 292] from Tokyo on 8th August: The situation.is. still much the same, although work is; being to some extent resumed. Most business men blame the provocative action of the Government, but think the strikers cannot hold out long owing to lack of funds. . It is thought certain that in the next session members of the Government will be compelled to introduce legislation more favourable to Labour generally. Unemploy-ment is a new feature in Japan and the root of the strike appears to be the fear of dismissal without pension or prospects. Workmen who have taken&apos; part in labour troubles are afraid they will be the first to be dismissed.Referring to the foregoing Sir Charles telegraphed [No. 295] on 12th August as follows: The Consul-General at Kobe reports the strike has come to an end very &quot;&quot; suddenly and without the mediation of officials or others. The organization of the workers collapsed owing to want of funds and they returned to work on 9th August. Although this appears&apos; to be a complete victory for employers,&apos; the settlement is generally regarded as merely temporary, and it is thought that the Government will be obliged to legislate for the improvement of the conditions of labour.Washington Conference [F.C.R., xlix, p. 6].-Lord Curzon telegraphed [iSio. 168]&quot; the following message to Sir Charles Eliot on 17th August:-In a report from the Times correspondent at Tokyo published in this morning&apos;s Times it is stated : &quot; One point that, has escaped public comment, but about which there is strong feeling in influential quarters, is that the British Government without first having consulted Japan proposed the Conference to the United States and Japanese Ambassadors simultaneously, thereby rushing Japan into an arrangement about which,, as it turned out, she is now full of misgiving.&quot;
If this strong feeling exists it is not justified by the facts, which are as follows :-I saw the Japanese Ambassador by appointment; on 4th July to discuss the question of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement. After reviewing the present position,, 1 informed Baron Hayashi that the plan had commended itself to the Imperial -Conference then sitting in Downing Street, that a conference on the Pacific question should be held between all the Powers principally concerned, with a view to arriving at an agreed solution; the main question to be submitted to the Ambassador was whether his Government would be prepared to join any such conference, f added. that I intended to see the American Ambassador on the following day and submit the proposal to him. It seemed to me, however, only consistent with our friendship with Japan that I should first approach the representative of Japan and, as I hoped, gain his support. I invited Baron-Hayashi to treat me with the fullest candour, to ask any question that he desired, and to say quite frankly what he thought would be the point of view of his Government.It is clear, therefore, that the Japanese Ambassador had ample opportunity for asking for delay to enable him to consult his Government had he thought necessary. His Excellency stated, however, that although he could not speak authoritatively for his Government until he had submitted the scheme to them, he entertained little doubt that they would welcome it, while he personally was strongly in favour of the proposal. In these circumstances there would have been no sufficient justification for postponing the interview with the American Ambassador which I had mentioned to Baron Hayashi, as the matter was one of urgency. The interview with Mr. Harvey -did not take place until,the afternoon of the following day, 5th July.A further telegram [No. 174] was sent to Sir Charles from the Foreign Office ou 19th August: The Japanese Ambassador called on 16th August and stated that he had received two telegrams from the Japanese Government, (1) announcing that on. &apos;9th August they had accepted the American invitation for 11th November, (2, that they wished to remain in the closest touch with His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards settling the agenda of the Conference. They proposed to communicate at once if (a) the American Government came forward with&apos; suggestions, (b) they themselves decided to raise any points.His Excellency. was assured of the gratification which this ^decision afforded to His Majesty&apos;s Government.PERSIA.South Persia Rifles [F.C.R., xlix, p. 6].-Telegraphing [No. 437] on 9th August in acknowledgment of the Foreign Office telegram [No. 312], Mr. Norman reported that the Persian Government were endeavouring to obtain the services of Swedish officers for the South Persia Rifles, and believed that they would succeed in getting them on the spot in less than six months. The proposal for a six months&apos; contract with British officers was meeting with opposition on the ground that the arrangement would be rejected by the Medjliss. Mr. Norman had informed the Persian Govern-ment that unless the contracts were concluded the British officers would leave as soon as the disbandment of the force was completed.On 11th August Mr. Norman was authorized [No. 319] by the Foreign Office to inform the Persian Government that if they agreed to the proposed arrangement, the stores, &amp;c, remaining on charge with the South Persia Rifles would be transferred to them free of cost.Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 444] on 1.2th August that the Prime Minister still professed anxiety to take over the South Persia Rifles, but pressed him to agree to the substitution of an exchange of notes, whereby the conditions of employment would be regulated, for signed contracts. The latter, he said, would certainly be rejected by the Medjliss, whereas the former need not be submitted to it. Mr. Norman had declined on the ground that the case of the British officers serving with the Cossack division made it doubtful whether the pledges given in a note would be held a&amp;. binding by the successors of the present Government, should it fall. In his view the position of British officers in Persia could only be secured by contracts, and he was sure that the officers of the South Persia Rifles would agree.On 13th August Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 449] to the South Persia Rifles with reference to the above to ask their opinion on the proposal. He considered the Prime Minister was certainly right in saying that the Medjliss would reject31-4   . C
contracts. It appeared to him that an exchange of notes was the only chance left of assuring the continuance of the force. It was the opinion of the Financial Adviser,, who regarded the maintenance of the South Persia Rifles as essential to his mission, that such a note would have all the force of individual contracts.- Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 454] on 15th August the reply of the Inspector-General to the effect that he thought that the majority of the British officers would-waive contracts for the time being, provided Mr. Norman considered the Persian &apos; Governments note satisfactory.   Mr. Norman ashed if he was authorized to conclude an arrangement on this basis.The Secretary of State replied [No. 333] to this on 19th August saying that he had not yet heard that the Persian Government had accepted the arrangement, referred to in his telegram [No. 312] of 3rd August. When the official concurrence of the-Persian Government had been obtained, the Secretary of Slate would be prepared to discuss the matter with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who were to provide for the maintenance of the force for six months at .30,0001 a month. Should this be satis-factorily arranged the Secretary of State saw no reason for withholding the authority ashed for by Mr. Norman in his telegram [No. 454] of 15th August.Financial Schemes. On 11th August Mr. Norman transmitted [No. 441] &apos;a. message from the Financial Adviser in which the latter recounted the information which he had gathered from the Prime Minister after two months of procrastination. The Persian Government were set on obtaining loans on-a very large scale. The details were somewhat as follows:-The total&apos; would amount to 100,000,000, or even 150,000,000 tomans, on the security of their customs and oil revenues. The objects in view were the paying off of British loans, budget deficiencies, and expenditure on internal development. Included in the last were the re-establishment of the late-Russian bank as a national bank, railway construction, irrigation schemes, &amp;c. The-Financial Adviser pointed out to the Prime Minister that the British debt, amounted to about 8,O0O,O0OZ., and reminded him that all custom duties were already reserved. The Financial Adviser abstained from criticizing the absurdities of the Prime-Mini ster&apos;s programme, and suggested in his report that action should be taken on the following lines, viz.: :(F) That, both as to the amount and the terms, the British group should outbid the American group; (2) that an immediate offer for railway construction and for the whole programme should be made on which negotiations might be begun with the object of gaining time ; (3) that in the event of the fall of the present corrupt Government, the utmost moral support would be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to an honest national Government which would probably succeed it, of whose support the Financial Adviser had already received assurance-He suggested the possibility of a famine if the Teheran grain supplies were not financed. He considered it would be impracticable to cut off the prospect of loans from British sources, and. in the anxious position in which he found himself he-appealed for advice.In a telegram [No. 442] on the same, date, Mr. Norman stated his general concurrence with the above, except as regards the monthly loans from British, sources. In his opinion the present Government would fall without such loans, as they could not obtain money from elsewhere in time to save themselves. The loans could be resumed as soon as a respectable Government was in power, from which grain could be purchased to stave off the prospective famine. There was no guarantee that the present Government would so utilize any money received. Mr. Norman believed that the prompt appointment of a better Government would be a safeguard against disturbances fomented by the present Minister of War and the Russian legation.; POLAND.Government Note. Mr. Max Midler reported [No. 361] on 15th August as; follows: The Polish Government has addressed a note to the allied representatives regarding the decision to refer the Upper Silesia question to the League of Nations, deploring the inevitable delay which will ensue in reaching a decision, and pointing out the clanger of a renewal of troubles in Upper Silesia, and prejudice to the whole-national life of Poland caused by a further postponement in fixing her frontiers.
RUSSIA.Belief Measures. -The following telegram [No. 17] was sent from the Foreign &quot;Office to Mr. Hodgson at Moscow on 19ch August: The question of relief for Russia was discussed by the Supreme Council, and it was decided to create an International Commission to study the possibility of giving immediate assistance to the starving-peoples of Russia. It was agreed that each Power should appoint three representatives to the Committee, which should meet at Paris as soon as possible. The Committee should have power to add to its numbers by selection of representatives from border and other interested States^and should decide what other organizations working for the same purpose should be co-ordinated with it. The question of protecting Europe against the grave danger of typhus and cholera from Russia was also discussed. As the League of Nations Epidemic Commission has now come to an end of its resources it was agreed that the Council should invite all those Powers who contributed last year to renew their subscriptions.The British delegates on the International Commission would be Sir Philip Lloyd Graeme, Sir John Hewett, and Mr. Wardrop, who will proceed to Paris as soon as the representatives of the other Powers are ready. -On the same day Lord Hardinge sent the following telegram [No. 625] from Paris : I have made repeated enquiry of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the probable date of the first meeting of the Russian Relief Commission, but find that nothing can yet be settled definitely as (a) persons invited to act as French delegates have not yet accepted the invitation, (6) no replies have been received from the Italian, Japanese and Belgian Governments to the enquiry of the French Government regarding the names of their delegates, and the French Embassies at Rome and Brussels have been instructed by telegraph to press for an immediate answer, (c) the United States Embassy, in a note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, merely state that the question has been referred to Washington &quot;for instructions regarding reply,&quot; i.e.,. there is nothing as yet to show that United States Government intend to be represented at all. . a-Telegraphing [No. 628] again on 20th August, Lord Hardinge sent the following to Lord Curzon : I gather that the persons invited to act as French delegates will in all probability accept. This morning I hear that the Italian and Belgian delegates are appointed, though the names have not yet been communicated officially to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The latter entirely agree as regards the desirability of the Commission meeting at once, and will be grateful if Your Lordship could instruct the British Ambassadors at Tokyo aird Washington to impress the urgency of the matter on the Japanese and United States Governments.SERBIA.The Baranya Question. On 16th August Mr. Straug telegraphed [No. 175] the following information from Belgrade : The press reports this morning with great satisfaction the proclamation of the &quot; Serbo-Magyar Democratic Republic of Baranya &quot; under the protectorate of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom, of which details will already- have been received from Colonel Gosset, The newspapers regard it as the manifest will of the people, which will impose reconsideration by.the Allies of the question of evacuation.It is reported also that volunteers from Slavonia and Voivodina will enrol themselves in defence societies which are being organized in Baranya to offer armed resistance to the entry of Hungarian troops.Bela Binder has (? group nndecypherable) see the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Pasitch&apos;s chef de cabinet volunteered the remark that preparations had been made for evacuation according to plan, but I cannot regard this as entirely authoritative.Mr. Strang telegraphed [No. 178] again the next day as follows :-The following is the translation of Pasitch&apos;s reply as given in the official communique to-day : &quot; Question of Baranya depends not simply on our state but on international treaty.

Telegraphing [No. 569] from Constantinople on 12th, August, Sir Horace Rumbold reported the following identic telegram from the three allied High Commissioners to their Governments: At a meeting held od 5th August at the British High Commission, the members of the Provisional Financial Commission of Control made representations to the allied High Commissioners on the subject of the difficulties which they encountered in endeavouring to carry out the mandate entrusted to them, and to ensure the equilibrium of the budget- of the Ottoman Government of Constantinople. They submitted a memorandum dated 4th August containing concrete proposals for the extension of their powers, which are briefly as follows : (1) That all inspectors of finance should be placed under the Provisional Financial Commission.(2) That all departments and administrations should establish budget expenditure for six. months, beginning 1st September, to be examined before being definitely adopted, by a mixed commission composed of delegates appointed by the Minister of Finance in agreement with the Provisional Financial Commission.(3) That controllers of authorized expenditure should be appointed in all administrations on the proposal and indications of the Provisional Financial Commission.That the collection and administration of. all dues and taxes in Constantinople and the provinces should be insured for the account of the Government by the, Provisional Financial Commission, which should have the right to modify the organization of the collecting services in agreement with the Government.The Porte should also be requested to appoint as soon as possible a delegate authorized to study, in agreement with the Provisional Financial Commission, the preparation of the finance law or laws to be. promulgated for the application of the above principles.The High Commissioners considered that, in virtue of the authority vested in them by the armistice, and in the interests of public order, it was their duty to accept-the responsibility for pressing upon the Porte the adoption of the proposed measures. Unless, therefore, the three Governments see any objection, the allied High Com-missioners propose to address a note to the Porte in the above sense.Sir Horace requested a reply.
