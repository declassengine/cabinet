FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ABYSSINIA.Woof Mahmud. On 21st March Mr. Russell reported [No. 33] from Addis Ababa that the Abyssinian Government had informed him that the operations against Wad Mahmud had resulted in his capture. They asked that the Sudanese Government should take measures against some of his followers who had taken refuge across the frontier.ALBANIA.The Italian Garrison in Scutari On 25th March Mr. Eyres reported [No. 13] from Durazzo that, in reply to their request for the withdrawal of the Italian garrison in Scutari, the Albanian Government had received a favourable reply from Italy if France and Great Britain would agree ; and that the President of the Council considered the withdrawal a matter of urgent necessity, as recent events had incensed the Scutari population and he feared regrettable incidents.ARABIA.King Hussein and the Treaty [F.C.R., Ixii, p. 2].-Mr. Grafftey Smith telegraphed [No, 24] as follows on 2&apos;Jth March :-King Hussein persists in basing his refusal to ratify the treaty on the non-existence of the former agreements referred to in article 5. It does not follow that ratification would automatically follow the revision of this article, but this would remove the objection most vociferously urged.I have hitherto taken the line that any revision of the treaty is out of the question. Had I been able in the February conversations to offer to omit the words &quot; and to respect &quot; to the end of the article, the concessions would have been, in the King&apos;s then state of mind, most valuable. A similar opportunity may occur again. We hold King Hussein&apos;s signed statement that no former agreements exist. This should obviate the resurrection of old claims referred to by Colonel Law.Purchase of Steamers. On 27th March Mr. Grafftey Smith reported [No. 22] that Rushdi Bey, commandant and harbour master at Jeddah, accompanied by the director-general of customs, was leaving for Massowah that clay to conclude arrange-ments for the purchase of two steamers for the Hejaz Government from Signor Pastori. Also that Rushdi Bey had informed him that the commercial exploitation of these steamers was a secondary consideration with King Hussein, who needed them in the first instance to carry arms and machine guns.Presumably, Mr. Smith added, Rushdi Bey meant by this, for use as coast patrol boats, but the alternative construction was no less probably true.BALTIC STATES.Conference with Russia [F.C.R., lxv, p.- 3]. On 25th March Mr. Dilley reported , [No. 17] from Kovno that he had been informed that day at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Lithuanian Government had that morning refused the invitation to attend the conference at Riga next week.Telegraphing [No. 38] from Riga on 29th March, Mr. Wilton reported that the Russian delegation had arrived that morning aud that a conference was being held. Latvia was represented by the Foreign Minister, Poland by the Minister, Finland by the Charge d&apos;Affaires, Russia by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Esthonian delegates would arrive next morning; Lithuania was not represented. The Russian delegation, numbering 60, would leave for Genoa on the night of the 30th.
Referring to the preceding message Mr. Wilton telegraphed [No. 40] from Riga *on 31st March as follows :  The meeting concluded yesterday and drew up a protocol embodying three points: (1) The reconstruction of economic life in eastern Europe; (2) the re--establishment of commercial relations between the parties; (3) the consolidation of peace in eastern Europe.These points are somewhat vaguely elaborated. They include the confirmation of treaties with Soviet Russia, the approval of de jure recognition of Russia, and universal limitation of armaments. Esthonia, Latvia, Poland and Russia subscribed to the protocol.   The Russian delegation left last night.Warsaw Conference. See under &quot; Finland.&quot;CTIILE.New Cabinets. Mr. Vaughan telegraphed [No. 26] the following list of new ^Ministers on 22nd March :  Senor Gallardo    - Minister of Finance.Senor Maira,       .... Minister of Justice.Sehor Fajardo     - - - - Minister of Public Works.Senor Jorge Matte - Minister of Interior.Senor Marchant   - Minister of War.Senor Barros Jarpa        .... Minister for F oreigu Affairs.. On the following clay Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 27] that the Ministry had resigned ; and on 3rd April he further reported [No. 30] the formation of another Cabinet as follows :  Seiior Guarello    -Seiior Garcia Huerta Sehor Barros      ... Senor Espinola    ... Senor Jaramillo -Seiior LastarriaCUBA.Foreign Labour. Mr. Haggard telegraphed [No. 10] as follows on 25th March :  A decree, which only required the presidential signature, has been passed pro-prohibiting the employment of foreign labour in the ports of Cuba &quot; so long as native workmen are available.&quot;This seriously affects important British concerns in the port of Havana as well as numbers of British West Indians. I have made strong official representations and my Spanish and United States colleagues are doing likewise.The measure is brought forward in the interests of the harbour labour union with an eye to the approaching elections. My protest, together with any enquiries that might be made by you of the Cuban Minister in London, will strengthen the hands of the Government in resisting it.FINLAND.Warsaw Conference [F.C.R., lxv, p. 2].-Mr. Rennie telegraphed [No. 55] as follows on 24th March : The Minister for Foreign Affairs has shown me the text of the agreement signed in Warsaw on 17th March by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Poland and the Baltic States, of which a copy was to be communicated to the allied representatives at Warsaw and should shortly reach you.It will have to be ratified by the Finnish Diet, and in view of the Polish declaration of 15th March serious opposition is anticipated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.As regards the declaring a mutual recognition of treaties concluded by the signatory Powers with the Soviet Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be glad to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to recognize the frontier as defined by the Rnsso-Polish peace treaty.- Minister of Justice.- Minister of War.- Minister for Foreign Affairs.- Minister of Public Works.- Minister of Interior.- Minister of Finance.
GERMANY.The Financial Crisis. The following telegram [No. 86] was sent by lord d&apos;Abernon on 26th March : I venture to urge yon to cause renewed consideration to be given to the facts stated in my memorandum of 25th December. They may contain the key to the-solution of the present very serious crisis.Since the date of the memorandum the figures have altered as follows : The total issue of currency in circulation is now 130 milliards.To-day the exchange is 1,415 to the  .The value of currency in circulation in Germany in sterling at the present exchange is 92 million.The value of currency in circulation in Germany in 1913 was 275 million pounds.Compare these figures with those in any other country as given in my memo-randum and it is abundantly apparent that the position is mainly due to panic, and that the underlying factors are not so desperate as the exchange collapse suggests. The panic proceeds from a total want of confidence on the part of the general public here that the problem will receive broad and intelligent handling. If an authority could be found or created of sufficient independence and strength to deal with the situation on businesslike and sensible lines in the common interest of creditors and debtors a satisfactory result is more than probable.As things are, all chance of reparation or of economic recovery is rapidly disappearing.The Reparation Note. On 28t,h March Lord d&apos;Abemou reported [No. 88] that the-Chancellor had addressed the Reichstag that afternoon on the reparation noteInstead of helping to stabilize the rate of exchange the reparations commission had effected the reverse.While admitting the justice of certain demands, he stated with great vehemence, amidst general applause, that no German Government could undertake to levy 60 milliards of new taxes in the time specified because :  (f) The  dictation  of   financial legislation   was  utterly incompatible with parliamentary government. (2) Germany&apos;s taxable capacity was already exhausted by the new taxationscheme and the compulsory loan. (3) Germany was paying an enormous invisible tribute owing to the depreciation of the mark.The preparations for Genoa had curtailed the time of the Government, and it was. technically impossible to fulfill the demands in the time specified.   Comparisons between taxation in Germany and elsewhere were unsound, because the taxable capacity of Germany, economically weakened by Versailles, was inferior to that of other countries.   Financial control was incompatible with the assurances given at. Versailles and London that the reparations commission would not encroach on Germany&apos;s financial legislative sovereignty.    Such control would be costly and ineffective ; costly, to judge by the experience with entente commissions in Germany, seeing that the salaries and allowances of Cabinet Ministers, the Chancellor and the-President of the Republic cost Germany less than two entente generals in Berlin;. ineffective because the taxpayer would feel justified in evading the obligation.Measures against the flight of capital were ready, but could only be effected wdth international help. The best remedy would be the improvement of the rate of exchange.Germany would continue to investigate the note before giving a final answer,. and hoped that the policy of fulfilment would not suffer shipwreck in the course of negotiations.Telegraphing again [No. 90] on the following day, Lord d&apos;Abernon further-reported that the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Herr Streseman had also addressed the Reichstag.The former said that, in view of the Cannes negotiations and of the recent agreements for deliveries in kind, the reparation note was a bitter disappointment to everybody who had hoped for a satisfactory settlement. The commission had ignored the warning, and the mark had continued to fall.   M. Poincare, after his
advent to power, had resumed the struggle with England ; and Boulogne had shown that he was not quite unsuccessful. He refuted the accusation that Germany had neither made reparation nor disarmed, and estimated the German reparations -up to date, exclusive of colonies and Silesia, at 45 milliard gold marks. . The door to negotiations with the reparation commission should not he closed.&apos; herr tStresemann said that the new note had disappointed all those who looked forward to Genoa for a detente in the situation. An international loan coupled with a moratorium for several years was the only solution. He approved strongly of the Chancellors attitude.East Prussia. On 25th March Lord d&apos;Abernou reported [No. 85] that represen-tatives of East Prussia had called to ask him to support the proposal that a small deputation should visit Paris for the purpose of stating to the conference of Ambassadors the German case with regard to the Vistula boundary. They contended that the-new decision of the boundary commission was worse than the previous decision, and could not for various reasons be reconciled with the interests of the inhabitants or the terms of the treaty.GREECE.Proposals for Peace with Turkey. On 22nd March the following telegram,, signed by Lord Ourzon, Signore Schanzer and M. Poincare, was sent to the English Italian and French representatives in Athens and Constantinople for communication to the Greek, Turkish and Angora Governments : &quot; Les Ministres cles Affaires Etrangeres cles trois grandes puissances, reuuis a Paris en vue cle retablir la paix dans le Proche-Orient et d&apos;etre mis a meme de faire cles propositions pour Pevacuation cle PAsie-Mineure, sans nouvelles pertes de vies et cle biens, estiment que leur premier devoir est cle recommancler instamment une suspension immediate cfhostilites aux gouvernements interesses,&quot; Les conditions de Parmistice proposes seraient les suivantes :-&quot; Article 1.-Les hostilities cesserout a minuit clans la nuit du         au 1922.&quot; Article 2. Tout en conservant les lignes generales occupees actuellement par le gros de leurs forces, les belligerants devront ramener en arriere leurs elements avances, de maniere a supprimer tout contact et a ouvrir un intervalle libre de troupes large d&apos;au moins dix kilometres entre les deux front, conformement aux decisions prises par les commissions locales composees cle representauts cles commandements grec et turc et cPofficiers allies.&quot;Article 3. Pendant la cluree cle Parmistice, aucun renforceinent en personnel ou en materiel ne pourra etre opere dans les armees opposees ; aucun enlevement d&apos;unites constituees ne pourra etre effectue.&quot; Article 4. Des commissions alliees, agissant sous une directioti alliee commune, seront attachees a 1&apos;une et a 1&apos;autre des armees belligerantes.&quot; Elles aufont qualite pour controler, clans chacune de ces armees, Pexecutiom cles clauses de Parmistice, et pour regler les incidents qui pourraient se produire a cette occasion. Elles auront egalement qualite pour intervenir aupres des autorites occupantes, en vue d&apos;assurer la protection des gens et cles biens dans les territoires occupes.&quot; Article 5. Les commandements en chef hellenique et ottoman s&apos;engagent a accepter et a executer loyalement l&apos;arbitrage des commissions alliees.&quot; Article C. Les hostilites seront suspendues pendant une periode de.trois mois, renouvelable automatiquement jusqu&apos;a ce que les deux belligerants aieat accepte les conditions cles preliminaires cle paix. Si Pun cles belligerants desire ne pas renouveler la presente convention, il devra en faire la notification a Pautre partie et aux representants de la Grande-Bretagne, de la France et cle lTtalie quinze jours au moins avant l&apos;expiration de la periode cParmistice en cours.&quot;On 29th March Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 110] as follows from Athens :  The French Minister yesterday communicated the allied proposals to the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs.   The latter circulated them in the Chamber, which adjourned until 31st March to consider them.I saw the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning, and told them that as regards. Thrace you had been more successful than I anticipated in securing the recommendation of the proposed line.   I drew particular attention to the 39-1 B
fact that the allied occupation included Rodosto, so that the inhabitants of that town Would have no cause for uneasiness. I also pointed but that many of the proposals would not be: welcome to the Turks, and that the Greeks must look upon the proposals as the best that could be secured.Both Ministers assured me that they were grateful to you, and knew that you had secured&apos; the fairest terms you could. They then turned to the question of the protection of Christian&apos;minorities in Asia Minor, and said that the guarantees proposed were not only insufficient in themselves, but were such as no Greek Government could defend with any hope of success.-Already telegrams had begun to arrive from Smyrna, and a regular panic would ensue as soon as the proposals were known. Every Greek who had the means would leave. They would be followed by a general exodus of frenzied inhabitants, who would achieve the destruction of Greece. The Prime Minister was particularly bitter at the proposals placing the Greeks and. the Turks in the same position regarding minorities. Of hundreds of thousands of Turks in European Greece not one had suffered during the war, whereas the Turks had committed wholesale massacres of millions. By placing the two nations on the same footing the Allies had dishonoured Greece.It was true that the Powers -were responsible ultimately for the Christian population, but the Greeks had a special responsibility in that they had enrolled many thousands iii their army to light for the Allies. How could these people be left to be massacred as rebels ? He could not leave them to their fate merely by throwing responsibility on the Powers.Then the Greek Government were called upon not only to evacuate Asia Minor but also to make sacrifices in Thrace. The first they could have done at any time if they had been willing to abandon the population while still holding Thrace. How could he justify the sacrifice in Thrace when they had obtained nothing for the populations in Asia Minor? He would be told he had better clear out of Asia Minor and let the Turks try to throw him out of Thrace. For reply I pointed out the advantages of peaceful evacuation. His Excellency begged me to telegraph urgently to you to explain the situation.The Government will consult the party leaders, including the Venizelists, to-day, and will have to make some sort of declaration of policy on Friday.The best I hope for is that they will accept the proposals as a basis of discussion with the Turks, provided that the Powers undertake adequate measures for the protection of the Christian populations in Asia Minor. This question, as I have so often pointed out, is the real difficulty, and I fear little progress towards a settlement will be possible until something much mote definite than the present proposals has been decided.I have some difficulty in harmonizing the terms of the armistice with the proposals regarding evacuation. The former forbids the Greeks to remove their forces from Asia Minor during three months (see Marshal Foch&apos;s interpretation of word enlevement). The latter appear to contemplate a beginning of evacuation immediately. The Greek Ministers did not raise this point, but they probably will, and I should like to be able to enlighten them.On the following day Mr. Lindley again telegraphed [No. 113], saying : Public opinion seems to be hardening against the aided proposals, and most papers have published very violent articles against them.In this crisis I thought it well to try to create a more favourable atmosphere, and to-day saw General Danglis, chief of the Venizelists, and MM. Boussios and Stratos. I begged them to look at the question as a whole, and to remember how greatly Greece was in need of peace and how much she had gained in the last .10 years. I also pointed out the feature of the proposals which would certainly be unwelcome to the Turks.General Danglis and M. Stratos were reasonable, but did not hide their bitter disappointment and anxiety regarding the Christian population of Asia Minor. M. Boussios maintained that the demilitarization of Thrace placed it at the mercy of Bulgaria. Pie also pointed out that the Greek community in au Ottoman empire which would be homogeneously Turkish would lie far worse off than it was in the old days when the Greeks could exercise political influence on the Government by working with other non-Turkish elements.He agreed that the Greeks required peace, but war was better than some kinds of peace. lie evidently hoped that, if some Venizelists were taken into the Govern-ment, Greece might obtain better terms. The Prime Minister has not yet seen the party leaders, and do One can foretell what will happen in the Assembly to-morrow.
On 31st Mavcli Mr. Liudley farther reported [No. Ill] that, in conversation, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had pointed out that to accept now would mean the inevitable fall of the Government, and they were right. Nor did they seem under any obligation to reply, until the Turks had done so, regarding the armistice. If the Turks refused the latter, the view of the Ministers was that the proposals for Greece automatically lapsed, and they evidently hoped to mobilize Serbia and Rumania against, the proposal for a common frontier between Turkey and Bulgaria.In the meantime he, Mr. Bindley, gathered that the movement for defending the Smyrna -zone and establishing autonomy there was gathering strength.JAPAN.The Budget. [F.C.R., Ixiv, p. 5].-Telegraphing [No. 81] on 28th March Sir Charles Eliot reported as follows: The Diet closed yesterday. The budget for the next financial year was finally passed on. 25th March, with the exception of two supple-mentary appropriations, one being for expenditure in connexion with the promotion of certain schools to university status. Although there was considerable disorder in the lower house on 25th March over an abortive attempt of the Government party to: force through a law for control of. &quot; extreme (thought, sic),&quot; the latter part of the session has been quiet on the whole, and the lower house has been occupied mainly with legislation.Since his return from Washington the Minister of Marine has on several occasions been asked questions about the conference, but there has been no (? fierce) attack on the Government as was originally apprehended.Situation in Eastern Siberia. Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 85] on 30th March that he had received the following telegram from Vladivostock:- The White troops have been gradually driven south owing to lack of ammunition and supplies. Over 2,000 withdrew along the railway into the zone guarded by the Japanese (south of Ussuri station) and were disarmed. The remainder, from 2,000 to 3,000, are retreating along the road towards Anuchinery followed by about the same number of Reds. There is little hope of the Whites being able to hold out much longer, and the whole force will probably be compelled to withdraw into the Japanese zone-Complications may arise between the Japanese and the Chita troops over the question of (? disarming). The Chita Government has notified the Japanese Govern-nient that they do not consider themselves bound by any Japanese agreement, on the alleged ground that -Japan assisted the White advance to Habarovsk. The Japanese have replied denying the allegation, and stating that drastic measures will be taken if Chita violates the agreement by advancing into the thirty versts zone.PERSIA.Anglo-American Oil Negotiations [F.C.R., lxv, p. 5].-Referring to..his telegram [No. 79] of 18th March, Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 84] to Sir Percy Loraine on 22nd March as follows :--The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have supplied copies of the following documents, dated 16th February :  (a) Certificate signed by the Persian Minister in  Washington empowering Mr. Sinister to negotiate concessions, &amp;o, on behalf of the&apos; Persian Government. (6) Certificate as above relating to loans.Both documents state that the Persian Minister has the clue authority of the Persian Government to act in this sense, (c) Mr. Shuster to the Standard Oil Company, stating that in consideration of the payment of one million dollars he agrees to the extent of his authority to bind the Persian Government to grant the northern oil concession to the Anglo-Persian and Standard Oil Companies wdth the approval of the Medjliss, upon the terms provided in a separate agreement. The document provides for a loan of five million dollars, on which one million dollars now - paid are an advance. Copies are being sent to you by messenger.39-1    - C
Attention is called by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the fact tbat, although the advance was paid to Mr. Shuster on 16th February, he did not receive instructions from the Persian Government to transfer it to Teheran until 1.1th March. Mr. ShusteFs contractual undertakings must have become known to them in the meanwhile.On 21st March Sir Percy Loraine sent the following telegram [No. 158]:  I propose the following formula for the preamble of the joint concession in order to reconcile conflicting points of view : -&quot;The Persian Government grants to the Persian-American Oil Company, whose statutes and articles of association will be deposited with the Persian Government,&quot; a concession to exploit, &amp;c. (of. the d&apos;Arcy concession), &quot; it being understood that the present concession supersedes and replaces all previous concessions for, &amp;c, hitherto granted in respect of Persian provinces and. territories hereinafter mentioned.&quot;Referring to the above in a subsequent telegram [No. 159] on the same, date, Sir Percy explained that he considered that a sufficient covering for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, whose participation would of course be shown in the statutes, would be provided by his formula, which might also surmount the Medjliss difficulty. He gave it as the view of the Prime. Minister that a formula containing no direct mention of British association would take only a week to pass the Medjliss. He urged that he should be allowed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to give the formula a trial.In reply to Sir Percy Loraiue&apos;s telegram [No. 158] the following telegram [No. 89] was sent to him from the Foreign Office for his personal information on 29th March :  The Standard Oil Company and the Anglo-Persian Company would prefer the omission of any preamble, and the former are taking steps in America in order that the initiative of any change may emanate from Mr. Sinister and the Persian Minister in Washington.   Pending developments there, further action should not be taken by you.POLAND.Vilna [F.C.R., Ixiv, p. 7]. Mr. Max Muller sent the following telegram [No. 73] from Warsaw on 28th March: ,. The Polish Diet last Friday ratified the act of (? union).and passed, a resolution calling on the Polish Government to take over the administration of central Lithuania. At the same time they admitted the 20 Vilna delegates as deputies on the ground, that their presence was necessary during the discussions on the elaboration of the autonomy scheme.The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me, before his departure, that he was opposed to this last step, but had to yield.RUSSIA.Proposed Relations with France. From Berlin on 2nd April Lord d&apos;Abernon sent the following telegram [No. 93]: M. Chicherin, who arrived at Berlin yesterday on the way to Genoa, has published the following communication through the associated press : Only on my arrival at Berlin did I learn that, in his last speech in the French Chamber, M. Poincare declared that the Russian Government were alleged to have made offers to France which were directed against France&apos;s allies. I contest this assertion most emphatically. The Russian Government have never in fact made any sort of proposals to France which were directed against her allies. It was not through the medium of veiled ladies, but through officials of French missions, and through well-known French members of Parliament, that Russia proposed to France to enter into negotiations, on the pre-supposition that better relations with France would lead to the further strengthening of good relations with England as well as France.As far as Genoa is concerned, the Russian delegation will most emphatically refuse to make any sort of previous statement in regard to preliminary con-ditions, arid in so doing they will only carry out the official declarations already made by the Russian Government.
Foreign Trade Monopoly. The following is the translation of an intercepted message: At the All-Russian congress dealing with food supply, M. Krassin, People&apos;?&quot; Commissary for Food Trade, delivered a report on the necessity for the monopoly of foreign trade. A. monopoly of foreign trade does not mean that all foreign trade must be carried on through the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, but that every trade transaction, abroad should proceed under the control of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade. Abroad at present we are the largest buyer and seller. We are taken into consideration, and people try to ingratiate themselves with us. On no account must we open our frontiers to unrestricted trade. . Economic enslavement would inevitably be folio wed by political intervention. We are now on the eve of concluding a number of agreements with foreign firms. We shall not .abandon monopoly of foreign trade while Russia is governed by workmen and peasants. Thanks to monopoly we have achieved many victories in diplomatic matters, and will obtain the complete recognition of Soviet Russia. The new economic policy does not mean the restoration of capitalism in Russia. The nationalization of land, key industries and transport, and monopoly of foreign trade have not been abolished and will not be abolished.SERBIA.Refugees. The following instructions [No. 22] were sent to Sir Alban Young on .29th March:-You should Inform the Sorb-Croat-Slovene Government that the Council of the League of Nations recently decided to transfer to the High. Commissioner for Russian refugees under the League of Nations the responsibility for the maintenance of all refugees hitherto supported by His Majesty&apos;? Government in Egypt, Cyprus, Malta, Touzla and Serbia. You should explain to the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government have been compelled to adopt this means of liquidating their obligations in view of the obstructive attitude of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government, and its refusal to carry out the terms of the agreement of October 1920, in spite of the fact that it has granted every facility to the French Government, and has accepted thousands of refugees under French control without any payment.2. Colonel Procter has been appointed to negotiate direct with the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government the terms under which refugees in Serbia will in future be maintained, and to make arrangements for the evacuation of all refugees at present supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Egypt, Cyprus, Malta and Touzla. His &quot;Majesty&apos;s Government will cease to provide for refugees in Serbia and elsewhere froiii 1st May.3. Colonel Procter will proceed to Belgrade early next week, and Mr. Childs will be transferred to him, as soon as the arrangements between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government are terminated.SPAIN.Political Situation. Telegraphing [No. 46] on 31st March, Sir Esme Howard sent the following report: The Government yesterday announced, the re-establishment of constitutional guarantees throughout Spain, in consequence of which the Minister of Education, who belongs to Senor Maura&apos;s party, and the Minister of Justice, who is a Catalan home ruler, have resigned. There appears to be no immediate danger of a general ministerial crisis.TURKEY.Proposals for Peace with Greece [see under. &quot; Greece &quot;].-On 26th March Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed the following message [No. 12] to Lord Hardinge for transmission to Lord Curzon : The Grand Vizier has replied in writing to the joint communication to the effect that, since the armistice question is not the sole concern of the Constantinople Government, the proposal has been communicated to Kemal, whose answer will be notified as soon as received.
The reply then proceeds to observe that the joint communication of the three-High Commissioners in announcing the eventual evacuation of Asia Minor by the Greeks makes no mention of a similar evacuation of Thrace, including Adrianople, &quot; without which the capital of the empire cannot be considered as free from the danger of future aggression.&quot;Telegraphing again [No. 182] on 31st March Sir Horace reported that the tone of the Turkish press in Constantinople was universally hostile to the proposed peace terms, although in some cases it admitted that these marked a considerable step forward towards peace. Comment was directed chiefly to Thrace. The surrender of Adrianople would be an inadmissible derogation from the national pact, and the proposed line would leave Turkey strategically at the mercy of Greece. The demilitarized zone would be of no use unless autonomy were given to western Thrace.Opinion had not yet taken shape on the other points, but it was argued, that. military restrictions were imposed upon Turkey, who had to assure the tranquillity of large territories in a primitive state whilst Greece might maintain what force she wished.It should be noted that the local press had not yet had time to receive a directive from Angora. The Angora press regarded the armistice proposals (which could be only answered after mature study) as inacceptable in their present form. Some suspicion had been expressed that they were inspired by the Greeks. Foreign control was looked on as a cloak for espionage.On 1st April Sir Horace further reported [No. 186] that he had informed the Grand Vizier that the Allies were not only solid as to the proposed frontier line in Thrace, but also unanimous in regard to the proposals; had begged him to regard the proposals as the extreme limit to which the Allies were prepared to go ; and had asked him to impress upon his colleagues that the utmost had been done to devise an equitable &quot;solution. It was important that the illusion that the territorial proposals left room for bargaining should be dispelled.The Grand Vizier had said that he thought a reply would be formulated after-two or three sittings of the Cabinet. For himself, he saw but little difficulty in arriving at a settlement on all points but one, and that was Adrianople. He did not see how the Turks could abandon their claim to that place.In regard to this telegram [No, 186] from Sir Horace Rumbold, Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 118] from Athens that he thought the Greeks would be more willing to accept the proposals if they could be sure that they would not be modified to their detriment in the course of negotiations. He quite agreed with Sir Horace&apos;s contention that it was important that the territorial proposals should be regarded as fixed.Refugees.--The following instructions were sent [No. 150] to Sir Horace Rumbold on 29th March : At a recent meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, Colonel Procter was appointed deputy high commissioner for the Russian refugees in Constantinople. Colonel Procter will be in charge of all arrangements for the evacuation of the refugees from Constantinople to the neighbouring countries, and will also negotiate for the evacuation of refugees in Egypt, Cyprus, Malta and Touzla hitherto maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government but now transferred to the League of Nations. Please make this decision public in Constantinople.
