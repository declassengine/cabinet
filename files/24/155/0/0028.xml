FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.EGYPT.Recognition by the United States.-On 26th April Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 203] from Washington that the Secretary of State had informed him in a note dated 25th April that the United States Government had decided to recognize the independence of Egypt; and drat the United States representative at Cairo was being instructed to inform the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs that this recognition was subject to the maintenance of the rights of the United States in Egypt as they bad hitherto existed.&apos;GERMANY.    .The Agreement with Russia. Telegraphing [no number] from Berlin on 24th April, Lord cPAbemon said that though the agreement with Russia was viewed in some quarters as a deliberate part of German policy, he himself regarded it rather as an expedient of despair adopted with reluctance by men who believed themselves to be in a corner. To imagine that any party in Germany really wished for an alliance with the Bolsheviks, or even for intimate co-operation with them, would be a mistake. Putting aside the fanatics on the wings, they were feared by every party for one reason or another, and the general sense was now one of hostility. But the position might change under extreme pressure or distress. Should such a change of feeling-come about, those French nationalists who were doing their best to bring about what they and we most feared must be held mainly responsible.GREECE.Turks arid Greeks in Asia Minor. Mr. Lindley reported [No. 1.66] on 1st/May that a delegation of Smyrna Greeks had called at tire allied legations that morning.They were much perturbed, and declared that unless the populations were protected by armed force they .would inevitably be either massacred or forced to emigrate. Either event meant the ruin of the richest part of Asia Minor and the latter meant the ruin of the Greeks as well. The behaviour of the Turks in driving off hundreds of Greek hostages, men, women, and boy scouts from Sokia, immediately after the Italian evacuation, was a fresh proof of Turkish intentions.JAPAN.Siberia. The following information, obtained from confidential sources, was telegraphed [No. 108] by Sir Charles Eliot on 18th April: The Darieii conference has been broken off. The Japanese lay the blame on Chita and say that the matter had reached a stage at which the terms of a general agreement were practically settled. The Chita Government, on the other hand, accuse the Japanese of insincerity. It is thought that the Chita Government may wish not to conclude an agreement till after the Genoa conference has come to an end. Chita now declares its independence of Moscow, but if Moscow were recognized by the Powers Chita would probably be absorbed, and the existence of an agreement with her as an independent State might be inconvenient. There is reason for thinking that the Japanese are not indisposed to await the end of the Genoa conference. The American Ambassador believes that negotiations will be resumed and that the Japanese are sincerely anxious for the withdrawal of their troops from Siberia.PERSIA.Russo-Persian Relations [F.C.R., lix, p. 7].-On 23rd April Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 193] that he had received confidential information that the Russian Minister was shortly going to leave Teheran, ostensibly on. leave, but without the idea of returning.   The name of the Minister to succeed him had not transpired.
American Advisers [F.C.R., lxiii, p. 9].--On 24-th April Sir Percy Loraine reported that he had heard from the Prime Minister that the Government, being convinced of the necessity of financial reform, were engaged in active negotiations with the new American Minister for the employment of American advisers. The Medjliss regarded the scheme with favour.Wireless Telegraph Stations. In. confirmation of a. report [No. .174] sent on 8th April to the effect that he had received intimation that the Persian Government intended to abolish existing wireless telegraph stations in Persia and to establish their own, Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 194] on 24th April that he had now received ,an official note requesting the abolition of British stations. Sir Percy had drawn the attention of the Prime Minister to the value of the Gulf stations to navigation and to the absurdity of abolishing them. He had told the Prime Minister that rather than send an unpleasant reply,to the note he would defer his answer until he had consulted his Government, and suggested that the regularization of the status of the Gulf stations would be the correct basis of discussion. The Prime Minister agreed and proposed that the Persian Government should purchase the stations. In reply to this, Sir Percy pointed out that there were no trained Persian operators to work them. Sir Percy requested information as to the views of the Foreign Office.The Political Situation [F.C.R., lxvii, p. 4-]. On 24th April Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 195] as follows: The disinclination of Mustaufi-uI-Mamalek to take oil ice, and the popular impression that the Minister of War would become Prime Minister if the Cabinet fell, seems to have given the Prime Minister a fresh lease of life, though rather a negative one.Proposed Movements of Troops. Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 198] on 25th April that he had received an official request from, the Persian Government for British troops to be withdrawn from. Gulf ports. He had reminded the Prime Minister that the maintenance of order and the protection of Bushire against marauding tribes had been dependent on these troops for many years past. The Prime Minister had said that it was the intention of the Persian Government to send a strong force of regular troops to Bushire, who would lie competent to preserve peace.Bearing in&apos;mind that the withdrawal of British troops had been agreed to in principle in 191.2, on certain conditions involving the maintenance of order and security, which however had hitherto not been, satisfactorily fulfilled, Sir Percy sought tiie views and instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Telegraphing [No. 1.99] again on the same date, Sir Percy reported that the intention of the Persian Government to send regular troops to Arabistan had given rise to some anxiety in the south. The object of tins move was to compel the payment of revenues by the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who, in spite of the good advice we had tendered to him, had obstinately declined to act on the quite reasonable terms -which had been offered to him some time ago. Sir Percy thought that pressure might be brought to bear on the Sheikh to oblige him to settle his liabilities and put an end to this constant source of trouble. Sir Percy realized that the presence of Persian, troops in Arabistau would be highly undesirable, but hoped that he might be able to prevent their despatch if the question of revenue could, be settled, lie had accordingly requested the President at Bushire to make strong representations to the Sheikh, and had notified India and Baghdad, the latter on account of the responsibilities devolving on Irak should our oil interests be threatened.RUSSIA.The Da.nn.ha. On 21st April the following-. telegram was sent to the Foreign Office by M. Karakban, acting Commissary for Foreign Affairs at Moscow, and M. Jakovleff, joint Commissary for Foreign Affairs of the Ukraine Government :-Les gouvernements sovietistes de Russie et Ukraine, ayant appris quune conference chargee cVexaminer les questions relatives a la navigation du Danube s&apos;est reunie a Bucarest le 2 avril, ces gouvernements se yoient obliges de protester energiquenieijt centre la tentative de regler a leur insu des quest-ions qui out rapport a la territoire de la federation Russie. et d&apos;Ukraine, ^elimination desrepubliqu.es sovietistes du nombre des puissances qui out droit d&apos;etre invitees a participer aux travaux de cette conference ne pent etre consideree par les gouvernements de la

Sir Horace Rurnbold telegraphed [No. 233] as follows on 30th April :--The Porte expresses gratitude for the expression of the allied Governments&apos;&apos; readiness to hasten the evacuation, and sees therein a wish to end the Greek atrocities. The Turkish Government do not regard evacuation, necessary to end such atrocities-and a situation contrary to international law, as a favour requiring compensation. They are confident of the reception which will be accorded, after a fresh examination, to the request for prompt evacuation of the territory occupied by the mandatory, which has outstripped the limits of her mandate. This confidence is all the more justified as the Porte is ready to accept in their ensemble the peace conditions of 26th March, subject to the discussion of special points.The Porte accedes to the first principle given as the basis for the allied proposals.In discussing peace preliminaries it will show that the just application thereof cannot impose on Turkey fresh territorial amputation in eastern Thrace.The Turkish Government, expresses gratitude for the second principle, and are confident in discussing its application that they will prove that the cession of any part of eastern Thrace, contrary to tire principle of nationalities and the security of Turkey, is incompatible with it.All questions relative to the financial and judicial organization of the land and sea forces, reparation, and indemnities, are closely connected with the reconstitution of a vigorous and independent Turkey. Discussion of these matters is reserved for the proposed conference. The Porte is particularly gratified by the affirmation of the third principle, which assures to the- moslems the maintenance of secular titles and prerogatives, equal treatment and respect in their case also for the basis proclaimed in the pact of the League of Nations. Nothing could inspire greater confidence regarding the results of the impartial examination of observations which it will submit to the conference, with a view to effect being given to this principle.As regards the fourth principle, the Porte considers whatever may be the extent of Greek sacrifices or the justice of compensation therefor, such justice cannot require compensation at. the expense of Turkish territorial integrity, which Greece attacked subsequent to the armistice of 1918.The Turkish. Government subscribe -with alacrity to the fifth principle, and promise full co-opieration at the conference in giving effect to a condition so essential to lasting peace, which would be compromised by any injustice or any threat to the security and right to subsistence of Turkey.The Porte adheres fully to the sixth principle, regarding minorities, which it considers a general and reciprocal duty of States. In&apos;discussing the means of assuring protection, it will merely seek to guard against possible ferment due to a false conception of the first principle. The protection of minorities must not be an incitation to revolt, and must not expose majorities to.danger from tyrannical minorities. The Powers have deduced from their seventh principle the demilitarization of certain zones and the institution of a straits commission. The Porte admits the principle of the demilitarization of zones strictly necessary for the security and freedom of the straits to ships of all nations under international guarantees. The proposed measures, however, outstrip the object in view without ensuring the safety of Constantinople. The Tuilrish Government are ready to discuss in the most (group omitted) spirit the regime necessary to ensure the fullest freedom of navigation to all States on an equal footing, as well as the security equally necessary for Turkey and the maritime Powers generally. These declarations show acquiescence in the essential principles proposed by the Allies as a basis of peace preliminaries. There is consequently no obstacle to the immediate negotiation of the latter and the evacuation of the occupied regions without delay.-The Porte will enter into the proposed joint examination of peace conditions without bias. Like the Allies, it desires to seek nothing calculated to offend the judgement of the world, and will accept all that justice requires in its desire for the joint establishment of a desirable peace.
vl. .. 5..&apos;  :    &apos;The Turkish Government consequently ask to he informed as soou as possible of the date and place of conference, in order to select and despatch their delegates.Note from Angora on the Armistice Proposals [F.C.R., lxvii, p. 5]. Sir Horace Kumbold telegraphed [No. 2.19] from Constantinople as follows on 23rd April: Hamid Bey, this afternoon, handed to the allied High Commissioners a note, dated 22nd April, addressed by Yussuf Kernal Bey to the three Foreign Ministers. The following is a condensed translation : Basing themselves on the declarations of the three Foreign Ministers relative to their earnest wish for the restoration of order and peace in the Near East and on the fact that the armistice was proposed solely with the intention of ensuring the peaceful evacuation of Asia Minor, the Government of the Grand National Assembly had thought that the arrangement for evacuation simultaneously with, the armistice would be more consonant with the logical consequences of the objects in view; they therefore thought they had conformed in their note of 5th April to the views of the allied Powers, who contemplate the exclusion-1 of all possibility of renewal of hostilities.When the three Foreign Ministers urgently recommended the suspension of hostilities in their note of 22nd March, they stated that they had in view the restoration of peace and the means to enable them to make proposals for the evacuation of Asia Minor without further loss of life and property. Moreover, the note of 26th March concerning peace conditions stated that the armistice had been proposed with the declared intention of ensuring the peaceful evacuation of Asia Minor and the restoration of Turkish sovereignty over the whole of that region.Lord Curzon further stated in the House of Lords on 30th March that the invitation to accept the armistice was accompanied by the intimation that the armistice would he followed by measures for evacuation.The Turkish people, taking into consideration these successive declarations, hoped that evacuation would be proceeded with simultaneously with the armistice. They note, with regret, that in the last communication of 15th April the Allies have declared their inability to accept, immediate evacuation accompanying the armistice, and have subordinated evacuation to the acceptance of the ensemble of the peace conditions. My Government refrain from discussing here the fact that the Allies invoke as reasons for this postponement, the probable refusal of the Greek Govern-lrient to accept such a condition before the commencement of negotiations, and the eventual resumption of war in Thrace, conduct of which if pursued would imply effective opposition to the earnest desire of the Powers for peace. Anyhow, the said reasons prove the conformity of the Turkish view regarding evacuation with the interests of peace as well as with equity. My Government feel it necessary, however, to insist that in the formerly flourishing occupied territory the Greek army adds daily new arson and devastation to its previous crimes, and increases the number of innocent moslems massacred; the massacres and burning of villages in the last few clays, especially in the Sokia region, evacuated by the Italians, are a new proof of our statements. The ruin of the Turkish territory and the atrocities on the formerly comfortable population since the Greek occupation are attested by all neutral foreigners, including the Red Cross delegates. My Government are unwilling to believe that the Powers, whose efforts for the -protection of Christian minorities are known, can abandon for a further period the moslem majority groaning under the. Greek occupation and remain simple spectators of their sufferings.We appeal to the humanity of the Foreign Ministers to deliver our brethren at the earliest moment from this intolerable enemy administration in accordance with their own intention of following the armistice by &quot;immediate evacuation. We firmly hope that the Allies wall readily excuse the Turkish people, anxious to deliver their compatriots quickly, for their inability to consent to evacuation being made subject to the acceptance of the ensemble of peace conditions. .1 had already expressed the willingness of my Government, in the event of the acceptance of their view regarding evacuation, to comply with the invitation to send delegates to study peace conditions. Nevertheless, the proposed conditions contain points which are in contradiction with the principles which the Ministers of Foreign Affairs have constantly had in mind and on wdiich their proposals are based, as well as with the following assurances given officially and published in 1918 by the British Premier: We are not at war to despoil Turkey of her capital and the rich and renowned regions of Asia Minor which are predominantly Turkish by race. 40-1 B
As, however, the principles stated in the note of 26th April, which aim at re-establishing the Turkish nation and&apos; its dominion in the areas which may be regarded as belonging to them with powers rendering possible a vigorous &quot;and independent national existence and secure an equitable regime for mosleras, do not differ from the aims for which the Turkish people have faced so many sacrifices, my Government do not abandon the hope of seeing peace conditions, inconsistent with principles previously enunciated, adapted thereto and thus to reach an agreement on the ensemble of proposed conditions.My Government repeat that the Turkish people desire nothing but to live independently and to be secure in the territory belonging to them, to rid themselves of political, judicial and economic chains hampering their free development, and not to be deprived on the sole ground of being a modem people of rights admitted as of course in favour of Christian peoples.Among the conquered States Turkey lias suffered most for participation in the war by loss of vast territories. In these circumstances, and seeing that the legitimate and modest aims of Turks are admitted in principle by the Allies, my Government consider that the only result of making evacuation subject to the acceptance of the ensemble of the peace conditions will be to allow the enemy during the months passed in establishing peace conditions to enable himself to resume hostilities and to give the invader an opportunity of attacking continuously on an ever increasing scale the life, honour and property of moslems in the territory, the attribution of winch to Turkey nobody contests.Moreover, as the bulk of the peace conditions concern the Great Powers exclusively, my Government are convinced that the Powrers do not, need to maintain the Greek invading army in Asia Minor in order to restrain (sic, V retain) the right of discussion thereon.J. must add that the Powers have left my Government in uncertainty by not indicating precisely what they consider the special points in the ensemble of the proposed conditions. This classification, by lending itself to various interpretations -according to different points of view, must present inconvenience and give- rise to discussion, and the result of all these discussions will be to protract the sufferings -entailed on the moslem population by the occupation.Basing themselves on these considerations, and while thanking the Foreign Ministers for their declaration regarding the considerable measure of satisfaction given to the principal request regarding evacuation, the Government of the Grand National Assembly are obliged to insist on their view regarding the necessity of commencing evacuation simultaneously with the armistice. Nevertheless, in order to avoid loss of time over correspondence and to settle by verbal negotiations the question whether the different views put forward with the object of attaining peace without fresh loss of life and property are reconcilable, and to reach a wo.rd-of-mou.th understanding on the points requiring elucidation&apos;, our delegates are ready to meet the&apos;plenipotentiaries nf the allied Powers at Ismid on a date to be fixed, in order to open in the first instance preliminary negotiations, and to proceed afterwards to peace negotiations in the event of a common ground being found.Should this proposal be accepted by your Government, please inform me, in order that I may communicate the names of our delegates.On receipt of this telegram Lord Cur/,on sent the following instructions to Sir Milne Cheetliam, in Paris [No. 1.52], and to Sir Ronald Graham, in Rome [No. 126]:  Please inform the Government to which you are accredited that His Majesty&apos;s Government have received a translation of the latest note from the Angora iGovern-nient, dated 22nd April, and can only regard it as profoundly unsatisfactory. Considering it is undesirable to embark upon a discussion of the various and mainly irrelevant arguments contained therein, they suggest that the allied High Com-missioners at Constantinople be instructed to return, immediately the following reply : The allied Governments have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Angora Governments communication dated 22nd April, and they are profoundly disappointed to find that it indicates a complete misapprehension of the allied proposals and intentions, which must, therefore, be explained afresh.There can be no grounds for the expectation that evacuation could be proceeded with simultaneously with the armistice, since article i! of the latter expressly prohibits the movement of troops.   The object of the armistice was
to prevent a renewal of hostilities and thereby both to create a favourable atmosphere for a settlement, which would include evacuation, and also to render possible an eventual peaceful evacuation without further shedding of blood.The conditions contained in the allied note of 20th March were submitted to the Governments of Angora, Constantinople, and Athens as the basis of a peaceful settlement, to be carried through under the auspices and with the assistance of the Powers. But they were put forward and must be considered as a whole, of which evacuation forms an integral part. On acceptance of this basis by both sides a conference between representatives of the above-mentioned three Governments and of the allied Governments was proposed to discuss the manner in which the several conditions should be carried out. As the result of this discussion it was intended to embody the terms so agreed upon in an instrument for signature which would ultimately replace the treaty of Sevres. This is what was meant by &quot;reservation of the discussion of special points &quot; in the allied note of lath April as to which the Angora Government have asked for explanation. It was not at any time proposed to begin the whole discussion again de ngvo ; for in that case the allied Powers would have wasted their time and could not usefully proffer their assistance.The allied Governments trust that it will be clear from the above that their proposals comprised three successive stages : (a.) assent to an. armistice; (6) acceptance of the totality of the conditions as a basis of settlement; and (c) the despatch of delegates to a conference to elaborate and extend these conditions into a treaty of peace.The Greek Government have already accepted the armistice ; the Turkish failure to do so presents obvious dangers in the liberty which it leaves both to the Greek army to embark on irresponsible adventures in Asia Minor and to the Greek Government to transport, their troops where they please. The Greek Government have also been urged to reply to the second and third proposals.After the foregoing explanation, and in view of the urgency of the situation, the allied Governments earnestly trust that they may receive an early and favourable reply from the Angora Government on all three points His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that the Government to which you are accredited will concur in the above reply and will instruct their representative at Constantinople accordingly.   It is obvious that, with further delay and argument the prospects oi achieving a settlement diminish.   It is to be hoped that our two allies will appreciate this and agree speedily to the terms of a decisive answer.As to the place of meeting for the conference as defined above, Ismid would dearly.,not be suitable, and among the various alternatives that have been suggested, Thorax)ia seems on the whole to be the most convenient.Problems in connexion with, the Fvacualion.-On 29th April Sir Horace Rumbold called attention [No. 231] to the fact that the evacuation of Asia Minor by the Greek army was likely to give rise to serious problems in connexion with the refugees.Even under the most favourable circumstances considerable numbers of Greeks, Armenians and Circassians, particularly those who had served in the Greek army, were, he said, likely to leave the country. Their disposal would be a matter of no little difficulty. It was more important to prevent any flight en masse such as had. occurred in Oilicia. The anticipatory nomination of special commissioners under the League of Nations and the elaboration of a programme for the protection of minorities, as contemplated in the proposals of the Paris conference, would to a certain extent tend to reassure the Christian population of Asia Minor aud to check a panic which might easily spread if visible signs of guarantee wore not on the spot before the evacuation began.While he realized that no effective action could be taken until the belligerents had accepted bodily the peace conditions, he considered that it would, be desirable to have (? a scheme) for the protection of minorities ready for adoption before the date for the commencement of the evacuation was fixed.Tee Occupied Trimutouy.The Forced Loan-On 20th April Sir Henry Lamb reported. [No. 21] from Smyrna that the Greek High Commissioner having, stated officially that foreigners would not be exempted from the application of the law on a forced loan, a meeting of the consular corps had been held that morning at the United States consulate, at
which, it was decided to send in a collective note protesting against this decision and reserving the rights of the various nationals.He did not, however, he added, anticipate any result from this step, as the High Commissioner would simply reply that they were under instructions from Athens.In regard to this Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed. [No. 232] from Constantinople on 29th April, saying : &apos;The allied High Commissioners have received identic communications from the Turkish Government here (? and from) the Government of Angora protesting against, the application of the forced Greek loan to Ottoman subjects in the occupied territory, more especially Thrace.The allied High Commissioners will, await the views of1 the allied Governments on the proposed application of the loan to foreigners in Smyrna before considering these protests. On the face.of it the position of Ottoman subjects, in all Greek occupied territories would appear to be on a par with that of other foreigners in Smyrna, but the question is of a nature to raise points respecting the constitutional position of Greece in Thrace,Enrolment of Ottoman Subjects by the Greeks. Sir Harry Lamb telegraphed [No. 22] on 26th April that the question of the enrolment of Ottoman subjects was becoming acute.. All men up to 33 years of age were being called up, and rumour said that the age limit will lie extended to 50. British firms were increasingly alarmed at the prospect of seeing their already seriously reduced staff further depleted. Some of the most important had warned him that they might be unable to carry on their business if more of their employees were taken.It was clear that the Greeks had no right to enlist Ottoman subjects to fight against the Turks, but our intervention had proved absolutely ineffectual.Was there any means, he asked, of holding them, responsible for the prospect of injury to British interests ?UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Naval Appropriation Bill [F.C.R., lxvii, p. 7]. On 20th April Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 196] from Washington that the naval appropriation bill, amended to provide for an average number of enlisted men for the navy for the&apos; fiscal year 1923 not exceeding 86,000,.had, passed the third reading in the House by 279 votes to 78. The amended bill, &quot;carrying a total of.over 251 million dollars, provided for pay and provisions, but did not provide for all the increases consequent on the increased personnel. It was estimated that another .1.6 million dollars at least must be added in the Senate. It therefore appears that the actual expenditure for 1923 will exceed 360 million dollars.The Soviet Government. The following telegram [No., 210] was sent by Sir Auckland geddes on 2nd May :-In receiving a deputation from, a women&apos;s league, which asked for the immediate recognition of the Soviet, the Secretary of State yesterday declared that, while there was lio legal barrier to trade between the United States and Russia, political recogni-tion would only follow the establishment of a sound basis for intercourse and &quot; is dependent upon the existence of a Government that is competent to discharge, and shows a disposition to discharge, its international obligations. This whole matter is in the control of those who dominate the affairs of Russia,&quot;
