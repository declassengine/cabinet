Mr. Macleay telegraphed [No. 91] from Buenos Aires on Gth June that the Maritime Workers&apos; Federation had returned to work that day ; that the general strike movement was at an end; and that the work in the port with non-union men was proceeding satisfactorily.GERMANY.Self-protection Associations. The following telegram. [No 295] was sent from Berlin by Lord D&apos;Abernon on 8th June : The President of the inter-allied Military Control Commission having stated in wilting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the list of self-protection associations to be dissolved, as communicated by the German Government, was incomplete, and having demanded a complete list of such organizations, in addition to the Escherich East Prussian Wehren and the Bavarian Einwohnerwehr, the German Government have replied that, so far as they are aware, the list already communicated is complete, and that all other organizations have already been dissolved by order of the various state Governments. In order to make doubly sure, however, the German Government have addressed a further enquiry to the state Governments, and any organization which may be found still to exist or to have been reconstituted will at once be dissolved in accordance with the law of 22nd. March, and its members punished.In sending me this correspondence to-day the Secretary of State assures me, in a covering letter, that the German Government have no intention of evading compliance with the obligation to dissolve all self-protection organizations which are contrary to the stipulation of Articles 177 and 178 of the peace treaty.The Chancellor on the Situation. Telegraphing [No. 291] on Gth June Lord D&apos;Abernon reported that he had had a long conversation with the Chancellor the night before, the gist of which was as follows :  The Chancellor began by expressing his gratitude for the action of His Majesty/a Government in Bavaria.   He regarded the Einwohnerwehr question as in a good way
towards settlement; but it was not yet finished. In any case the representations of His Majesty&apos;s Government had been-extremely salutary.With regard to the recent debate.and vote in the Reichstag, the Chancellor was somewhat elated. He said that on Friday he had thought that it would have been necessary to dissolve the Reichstag, and he had obtained the necessary authority to do so from the&apos; President of the Republic. The threat to dissolve, however, had been effective, and he now thought that his majority was fairly assured. There was a very difficult fence to get over when the Reichstag met again, namely, the new taxation which would have to be imposed in order to make reparation. This would literally mean doubling the present taxation ; and in any country that required a super-human, effort.   The people already complained that the taxes were unbearable.The Chancellor was- therefore most anxious that he should be able to show the Reichstag already accrued advantages of. the&apos;policy of &quot;accept and perform.&apos;? He alluded particularly to the evacuation of the three towns and the removal of the Rhine customs levy. He hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would use their best endeavour to give him this strengthening when or before he entered upon the taxation debates.Discussing the position on broader lines, the Chancellor said that it was a great mistake on the part of the allies to speak of their policy &quot; towards Germany.&quot; There was not one Germany, but two Germahies. The right policy depended upon whether the allies were faced with a democratic Germany which sincerely desired peace and work and reconciliation, or by a Germany led by reactionaries and communists, both, of whom appeared to prefer catastrophe to commerce. In the past sufficient distinction, had not been drawn between the two Germanies. He hoped that now the democratic Germany was in the saddle and has declared her resolute will to follow a wise policy, that the good intentions of the Government and its proofs of performance would be recognized by friendly assistance of a palpable and demonstrable character. There was no need to fear extreme measures from the majority socialists. They were really of the small bourgeoisie type, not socialists in the ordinary sense. Put some-thing in the stomach of the working classes of Germany ; let the German public see that the Germaii democratic policy had brought about an easier fate for the fatherland, and all would be well.The Chancellor continues to give me the impression of a very sincere man of ,great courage, faced by an almost impossible task in which he both requires and deserves assistance.Relations with England. Lord ITAbernon telegraphed [No. 298] as follows on 11th J une :  In my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, yesterday, he told me that his great desire in assuming office had been and was to improve the relations between Germany and England. If he found this to be impossible he would at once resign. In the meantime if anything occurred, or if anything was done by his subordinates which appeared to me to militate against better relations, ho -,voiild put it right directly I brought it to his notice.He advocated the above policy not out of affection for England, which he disclaimed, but because he thought that it was the only course of wisdom and safety for Germany, This did not exclude a desire to improve relations with France, which might follow as a corollary on improved relations with England. He had done his best to treat France as well as England, and to allow no grounds for suspicion that she was the least favoured nation.   However, this attitude required some reciprocity.Turning to the question of disarmament, he said he was satisfied with the progress made and particularly with the action taken in Bavaria.&quot; The merit of this great success was entirely the Chancellors; he had worked manfully and brought all his personal influence to bear on the Bavarian Government and the Bavarian political leaders. Apart from political considerations, the difficulty proceeded from the fact that the Einwohnerwehr officers had no other occupation; nobody wanted them abroad and there was no room for them at home. Disbandment therefore meant something like starvation.He again reverted to the parliamentary position of the present Government and said it remained very weak. He hoped that not only would the March sanctions be abandoned, but that their abandonment would be.communicated in such form that it might be announced by the Government in the Reichstag instead of through the newspapers. By this means something of a parliamentary success might be staged. It&quot; was urgently needed.29-3 A 2
4&quot;Upper Silesia.The German Advance. On 4th June Sir H. Stuart telegraphed [No. 173] from Oppeln as follows : I arrived this morning and was received by the President, the Italian. Com-missiouer, and the principal allied officers. Later I attended a meeting of the Commission, at which General le Pond informed us that the Germans, in breach of the-promise, given on 21st May, not to advance beyond the line then held, had attacked and pushed back the Poles and were in. contact with the French troops.General le Pond explained that this advance would necessitate the withdrawal of the French garrisons from the towns in the industrial area and their concentration around Gletsewitz. To avoid this withdrawal, which might endanger the lives of Germans in the industrial area, the Commission decided to call upon General Hoeffer to retire to the line previously held by him, this retirement to begin within 12 hours of the receipt of our order. It was added that failure to comply with this order would necessitate the above-mentioned withdrawal of the French troops. He was, however, informed that the territory evacuated by him would be held by the allied troops and not made over to the insurgents.Herr von Molke was informed of our order, and late this evening he appeared personally and protested strongly against what he called this menace to the lives of the Germans in the industrial area. The Commission repudiated any such intention and explained that the concentration of the French troops was a military necessity, to avoid which we had given General Hoeffer an opportunity of restoring the situation.Telegraphing [No. 175] again on the following day, Sir H. Stuart said :  General Hoeffer has not replied to the Commission^ communication, and has not only not withdrawn but has advanced, and the latest information is that his forces now hold a line running from Birawa on the Oder, south of Cosel, along the stream through Jacobswald towards Kieferstadtel. General le Pond at first said that this made it absolutely imperative to withdraw the French garrisons from the industrial towns, but eventually he agreed to leave them on General Heneker consenting to supply three British battalions to join the French and Italian troops in holding the line Oppeln-Stubendorf Gross-Strehlitz Ujest Klostau Kieferstadtel together with Gleiwitz. It is confidently hoped that this will stop the German advance without actual fighting, and I have just been told by General Heneker that General Grata&quot; er has informed him that the..alliecl troops are not to tire unless attacked by the Germans, General lioeffer has requested General Heneker to see him at the latter&apos;s head-quarters to-morrow morniug, and this -interview may possibly lead to a satisfactory clearing up of the situation. I am telegraphing to the Ambassador at Berlin to urge strongly on the German Government the imperative necessity for using all its influence with General Hoeffer to stop his advance and withdraw to Ins original iine, as his continued advance will endanger the safety of Ciermans in the industrial area - and probably lead to the destruction of the mines.Generals Le Pond and Marinis are telegraphing to their Ambassadors in the same sense. &apos; General Le Pond says that he is absolutely assured that the continued German advance will lead to massacre and destruction and complete anarchy in the-industrial area. I have not enough evidence to justify the adoption of this conclusion, but there is certainly a risk of murder and the sabotage of mines and factories.Neither General Heneker nor I regard the measures described above as com-pletely satisfactory, but with the small allied forces available it is difficult to suggest anything better, and the proposals may at least stabilize the situation and give time.GREECE.Cliimarra.-On 2nd June Lord Granville reported [No. 294] that he had received a telegram from the Greek notables of Chimarra, who had fled to Corfu, protesting against the occupation of Chimarra by the Albanians in spite of the arrangement come to in June 1920 for its provisional independence pending the decision of the Powers, and appealing for protection.The Albanians appeared to have sent an ultimatum to Chimarra ; the local Government of the latter then appealed to Greece for help, but the Greek Government felt unable to assist except by the despatch of a destroyer, which seemed to have had no effect; consequently Chimarra appeared to have capitulated, many notables fleeiug-to Corfu.
ITALY.The Porto Rosa Conference. Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 215] on -9th June, that according to a note received that day the Italian Government had decided to postpone the meeting.of the Porta Rosa conference till 2nd July as several of the states invited to it had nominated as their representatives their delegates at the Rome conference, -which probably would not meet till the end of June, and some of them had expressed a wish for a closer examination of the programme of the conference.The note added that the Italian Government would reserve accommodation for the foreign delegations at Porto Rosa, but that each particular Government must liear the expense of the rent of the accommodation for its delegation. They would like to know the number of rooms required for the British delegates and staff as soon as possible.- JAPAN.The Minister of War. On 1st June, telegraphing [No. 201] from Tokio, Sir Charles Eliot reported that the military attache had learnt from the Japanese War Office that the Minister of War had informed the Prime Minister that he could not attend any more Cabinet meetings on account of his health; It was thought that his resignation could not lie long delayed and. that he would be succeeded by General Yamanashi, the present Vice-Minister.   No change of policy was anticipated.MEXICO.The Question of Recognition. On 7th June Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 394] from Washington the following paraphrase of a telegram received by the State Department from its representative in Mexico communicating a statement made by the Mexican Foreign Office :  -The Mexican republic being a state whose complete existence and sovereignty have not been questioned for 100 years, its Government have the right to be recognized by the Governments of other countries in accordance with the established usage without other condition than its legality and capacity to comply with the international duties and. obligations of Mexico; therefore, in the light of international law, the -exaction that General Obregon should previously contract promises of any kind in order that recognition should be extended to him is not justifiable. Aside from this reason of law, neither is such an exaction justifiable because General Obregon first as a candidate and afterwards as an executive has made repeated statements to adjust his policy to the dictates of law and morality, has offered to repair equably the damages caused by the past revolution, and has given by his capacity to develop that policy and to fulfil those promises sufficient proofs, recognized not only by his own country in maintaining itself in perfect tranquillity, but also by many Governments of European, American, and Asiatic countries in renewing their diplomatic relations with Mexico.Therefore, the exaction of any promise whatever on the part of the American Government from that of Mexico precedent to the renewal of diplomatic relations &quot;would be unnecessary besides being unjust, and more than this, prejudicial to both countries because it would incapacitate the Mexican Government to fulfil the promise contracted, and would deprive it of the strength to accomplish its purposes of friendly co-operation with the Government of the United States not only on behalf of the interests of the two countries, but also of the general interests of the American continent.MOROCCO.The Port of Tangier.-On fith June Sir Herbert White telegraphed [No. 30] from Tangier that he had learnt from his French colleague that the Sultan had signed- a dahir granting a concession for the port to an international company. His colleague -had been informed as to this by his Government.PERSIA.Relations with Afghanistan. Gn 3rd June Mr. Norman reported [No. 325] from Teheran that-the&apos; late Persian Government had stated in reply to a communication
from him that the present Government of Afghanistan, being independent, had a right-to appoint and receive representatives, and that disputes with that country, which could not otherwise be settled, must be referred to an arbitrator, Persia being a member of the League of Nations.&apos; PERU.The Peruvian Centenary.-Qi\ 6th June Mr. Grant Duff reported [No. 96] from Lima (1) that his French colleague had received official information that a mission headed by General Mangln with the rank of ambassador would attend the Peruvian centenary ; (2) that the Spanish Government were sending as a special ambassador the Count de la Vifiaza, formerly its representative at petrograd and; the Vatican ; and (3) that the Brazilian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Lima would be appointed special ambassador for the occasion.POLAND.Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Max Muller reported [No. 308] from Warsaw on 13th June that M. Constantino Skirmuut, Polish Minister at Rome, had been offered the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, which it was anticipated that he would accept. He was not, Mr. Max Muller added, a political), and the proposed appointment had been generally well received,SERBIA.Treaty with Rumania.-Qn 7th June Mr. Strang reported [no number] from Belgrade that a treaty between the Serb-Croat-Slovene kingdom and Rumania had:, been signed there that morning.SWEDEN.Plot against the Constitution. Telegraphing [No. 108] from Stockholm on 9th. June, Mr. Barclay reported that according to an official police communique issued that afternoon a widespread plot was on foot to subvert the constitution by violent means.TURKEY.Reconstruction of the Government.-^--On 13th June Mr. Rattigan reported [No. 423] that the Turkish Government had been reconstructed as follows :-Tewfik Pasha    -        -        -   Grand Vizier-Ali Riza Pasha -        -        -  Minister of the Interior. Izzet Pasha      - Minister for Foreign Affairs.Zia Pasha        -        - &apos;       -  Minister of War. Salih Pasha      -        -        -  Minister of Marine. Arif Hikmet Pasha       -        -   Minister of Justice. Sefa Bey -        -       &apos;- -  Minister of Commerce and Agriculture.Hussein Kiazim Bey r - Minister of Finance and of Pious Foundations.. Nouri Effendi    -        -        -   Sheikh-ul-islam.Mustafa Arid Bey        -        -   Council&apos;of State and Public Instruction. Ali Riza Pasha, Izzet*Pasha and Saiih Pasha are former Grand Viziers, and Sefa Bey is Ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs.Telegraphing again [No. 424] on the following day Mr. Rattigan said that the-reconstruction did not indicate-any fundamental change in the policy of the Constanti-nople;Goverriment. Vis-a-vis the allies, the&apos;policy would be to endeavour to extricate Turkey from the mess in which the recent extreme attitude of Angora had involved the country and to dissuade them from helping Greece. Vis-a-vis Angora, it wouldf continue to be conciliatory if not subservient.
