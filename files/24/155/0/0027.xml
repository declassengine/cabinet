FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.ARABIA,Tribal Disturbances.--On 6th April Mr. Grafftey Smith telegraphed [No. 27] as follows: Emir Ali is now at Abu Nairn, north of Medina, with 500 regulars (unpaid for two months), about as many irregular Ateibah, other camel corps and a few horses. I do not know what tribes are with, or joining, him, but I understand that he has called all north of Medina to arms against Mudayana ; the objective is Kheibar, and the tribes have been led to expect support from Emir Abdullah in the north, if not froin King Feisal in the east,It appears to be the case of Emir Abdullah and Taraba over again, but I apprehend a more tragic issue. Emir Ali&apos;s party has had a skirmish already only 7 kilometres from Medina. The position is that the Harb and Juheina are lighting busily round Yambo; that the Anazeh and Muteir and Huteim are more and more attracted to Mudayanna Ets as an excuse for raid and pillage ; hostility to King Hussein is general, either because he does not pay tribal subsidies or, as in the case of Farhan Ul Aida of Kheibar, because of old scores. Emir Abdullah annexed Farhan&apos;s war subsidy during the latter part of the war. Tribesmen on all roads from Rabegh to Medina are unfriendly disposed to the King; and the pilgrim caravan now on the way, which Emir Ali definitely asked King Hussein not to send from Mecca, runs great risk.King Hussein and the Treaty [F.C.R., LXVI, p. 2]. The following telegram [No. 13] was sent to Major Marshall at Jeddah on 13th April with reference to the telegram sent by Mr. Grafftey Smith on 29th March:  You are authorized to suggest the suppression, by an amending protocol, of the fatter half of article 5, should an occasion arise when by doing so you would be abstain of semiring Hussein&apos;s ratification of treaty and the protocol amending it.CAUCASUS.Expulsion of Foreign Representatives.-On 6th April Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 197] from Constantinople that he had learnt that all non-accredited foreign representatives, including the Germans, were being expelled from Trans-Caucasus. Exception had been made in favour of the Italian Consul at Tiflis, who was the only authority empowered to grant visas and whose expulsion might have led to reprisals in Constantinople and in Italy, This action appeared to have been inspired by the Russian Government.GERMANY.The Position. Lord d&apos;Abernou telegraphed [No. 95] as follows on 11th April:  It may be convenient to your Lordship if I give a short summary of the positionin Germany to-day and if I note the changes which have occurred in the course of thelast few months.The political position is largely dominated by the financial, and the financial position has undoubtedly become worse. As regards pure politics, the situation is not unsatisfactory : Herr Wirth is stronger than he was ; the basis of the coalition is broader ; and an alternative Government is more difficult to find than ever. But this position may be destroyed by a financial crisis.The best barometer of the financial prospects of the country is given by the price of the German exchange, and this has gone rapidly down since the beginning of the year.The responsibility for this dangerous situation may be attributed in about equal proportions to the German Government and to the reparation commission.   The
former make no serious effort to stabilize their currency or to restrict new issues of bank notes. The latter make demands for payment and for deliveries in kind without taking into adequate account the effect which the payments and deliveries they demand must inevitably make upon the general financial position. Neither party appears in the least to realize that a continuation of the present course, for a short time, must lead to a financial catastrophe and reduce Germany to a condition similar to that of Austria and Poland.It appears almost inevitable that a financial breakdown will involve grave social and political consequences. The position of the old middle classes here is already pitiable. Their incomes are fixed in nominal marks and the purchasing capacity of the marks they receive diminishes in proportion with the fall in exchange. Their (income, whether proceeding from investments or pensions or salaries, is paid to them in paper, which is constantly being watered, and which constantly decreases in value. In the case of salaries some compensation for this diminished value has been met by increased pay, but the compensation is by no means adequate. In the case of income from investments and from pensions, even this inadequate set-off is absent. It appears to me that the moment cannot be far distant when this middle class will rebel against the conditions imposed upon it, and it may well become violently subversive and revolutionary.I continue to hold the view that, while the financial circumstances are critical and difficult, there is nothing in the position which could not be settled if a vigorous and enlightened German Minister of Finance met an intelligent and broad-minded reparation commission. This conjunction may be unlikely to occur, but the fact that the earning capacity of Germany has not been seriously impaired justifies a qualified hope that the position is not yet irretrievable.JAPAN.The Prince of Wales.  On 16th April Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 107] that since the day of his arrival the reception accorded to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales by the Court and all classes of the nation had been extraordinarily enthusiastic and spontaneous. The papers had also been full of most appreciative comment, and it -was said that no distinguished foreign guest had ever received such a welcome.The restrictions imposed, on the press by the Japanese authorities had somewhat irritated the local newspapers,-but His Royal Highness had received a deputation of them that morning, and appeared to have removed all dissatisfaction.PERSIA.The Political Situatian. Telegraphing [No. 172] on 7th April, Sir Percy Loraine reported that the present Government was in a shaky state, owing to their inability to cope adequately with the difficulties of the country. Preparations were being made by the late Prime Minister for his own return to power. The arbitrary measures of the Minister for War and the application of the army reform scheme had excited discontent among the democrats and among officers of the army, while officials whose salary was affected by the new budget were equally disturbed.Sir Percy was of opinion that the settlement of the Turkish question, and the bringing of Russia into dependence on the Austro-German Powers, as a result of the Genoa Conference, might put an end to the anti-British campaign. The-present Government apparently had hopes of finding support from the newly-arrived United States Minister to our disadvantage, hopes, which Sir Percy conceived, might be speedily dissipated. In some of the Teheran newspapers an anti-Russian note was already appearing. The resumption of Great Britain&apos;s attitude towards Islamic States, as soon as peace had been made with Turkey, was an idea that Sir Percy was fostering. Sir Percy himself was abstaining from taking any steps regarding the formation of a new Cabinet.On .11th April Sir Percy Loraine was informed [No. 98] by Lord Curzon that his attitude of abstention was approved. The hope was entertained that, even supposing the new United States Minister showed, himself to be unsympathetic towards us, the creation of difficulties at Washington would be obviated, by the co-operation between the Anglo-Persian and the Standard Oil Companies.
Iii a further telegram [No. 181], dated 18th April, Sir Percy reported that the Prime Minister^ resignation appeared to be imminent, and that Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek was being pressed by his supporters to take office. The candidature of the ex-Prime Minister was likely to be adversely affected by the forcible measures he had taken to oblige Mushar-ul-Mulk&apos;s resignation, which had been revealed in the Medjliss and had &quot;&quot;been reported by Mr. Bridgeman in his despatch No. 112.RUSSIA.Enter Pasha and BokJmra. On 8th April Mr. Hodgson reported [No. 79] front Moscow that it appeared to be established that Enver had placed himself at the head of the movement proclaiming the independence of Bokhara (? and) Khiva, lie had sent in an. ultimatum to the Soviet Government, tie had been informed that Enver had the support of the hill tribes in Bokhara and strong sympathy in Ferghana. Military operations had commenced.SlBKKIA.The Japanese and the Fed Force.-Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 103] as follows from Tokyo on 11th April :-The strength, of the Beds proceeding southward in the district between Ussuri and the sea is 4,000 with artillery. There is some evidence that a few Soviet troops are with the Reds. The 35th division (1st, 2nd and 114th brigades) is on the Trans-Baikal Railway, and the divisional headquarters are at Borgia.The Red force in front of the Japanese consists of the Chita 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and. 6th infantry regiments and the Troitzkosavsk cavalry unit who have now retreated to the north of Shmakovk. The Koreans among the Reds are over 600 in number. The Japanese casualties are so far negligible, those of the enemy about 80.   The Japanese use aeroplanes for bombing and reconnaissance.SYRIA.Demonstrations. Mr. Palmer reported [No. 5] from Damascus on .12th April that there had been fresh demonstrations on the 10th and the 1.1th, and that three persons were killed on the latter date and four -wounded ; 35 had been arrested.TURKEY.Reply to the Armistice Proposals. On 8th April Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 198] as follows ; The reply of the Constantinople Government, addressed to you, after an expres-sion of gratitude for the interest shown by the allied Ministries for Foreign Affairs in the re-establishment of peace, declares its readiness to send delegates within three weeks, to a conference for negotiations of peace.The note continues that you are already acquainted with the views of &quot; the army &quot; as regard an armistice. The Imperial Government, however, -requests that there may be no movement of Greek contingents withdrawn from Asia Minor to Thrace, or concentration of other troops in that province, and insists on the urgency of assuring evacuation as early as possible.Regret is expressed that &quot;local reasons&quot; oblige the Sultan&apos;s Government to request the allied Powers to designate a town of western Europe for the conference.The Imperial Government, whose only object is to assure the integrity and security of Turkey itself, political and economic independence, and the establish-ment of a lasting peace, trusts that satisfaction will be given heedless of (group undecypherable) to its (? rights).In regard to this, on. .17th April Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. .174], the following translation of the French draft reply to the Constantinople Government, in which His Majesty&apos;? Government had concurred : The French, British and Italian Governments have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Sublime Porte&apos;s reply, dated 8th April, to the peace proposals drawn
up by the allied Powers with a view to the re-establishment of peace in. the East,, They are glad to learn that the Constantinople Government is ready within three, weeks to send delegates to the conference for the purposes of peace negotiations.As regards the armistice, the allied Powers are unable to agree to an immediate&quot; evacuation of Anatolia.   The Greek Government; would refuse to consent to this before the opening of negotiations, or, were they to accept, it would be in practice impossible to prevent them from transporting their troops to Thrace, there eventually&apos; to recommence hostilities.But the allied Governments, desirous of according the largest possible satisfaction to the requests of the Constantinople Government, are prepared to-advance the date of evacuation. It might begin as soon as the totality of the peace-conditions have been accepted and under reservation of the discussion of particular points.&apos; The demilitarization of Thrace constituting one of the peace conditions, the Sublime Porte has no cause to apprehend the despatch of Greek contingents from -Anatolia to Thrace when, after Greek acceptance of these conditions, evacuation can commence.The allied Powers, conscious of having in a large degree satisfied the requests, and preoccupations of the Constantinople Government, would be grateful if the latter would communicate to them the names of its delegates. They reserve for subsequent -notification the name of the town which will be selected for the meeting, and they will endeavour to take into account the wishes expressed by the Sublime Porte with regard to this selection.Reply of the Angora Government to the Armistice Proposals. On 5th April, Sir&apos; Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. .191] the following slightly condensed English version of a message from Yussuf Kemal Bey delivered that afternoon to the three high commissioners by the Kemalist representative : -,Idie Government of the Grand National Assembly have examined with the-&apos; greatest attention the proposals for the immediate suspension of hostilities, urgently recommended as their first duty by the three Ministers for Foreign Affairs with the , eminently humane object of restoring peace in the Near East, and bringing about the evacuation of Turkish territory without further loss of life and property.    The Government of the Grand National Assembly are grateful for the efforts of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to end the war of invasion which the Greek army, landed, at Smyrna, conducts, as the civilized world knows, in a manner causing the loss of. countless moslein lives and incalculable devastation.   The Government of the Grand-National Assembly accept in principle the armistice proposed with the declared intention of bringing about the evacuation of Turkish territory.   They cannot, however, consent to let the armistice create in favour of the enemy the possibility of resuming the war of invasion condemned by the whole world with a fresh force, thus&apos; exposing Turkey to new sacrifices and again disturbing the peace of the world.   As the Great Powers are aware, reasons for this attitude are not wanting.   The Govern-ment of King Constantino met the efforts made at London in March 1921 by ordering an offensive which was unsuccessful.    King Constantine similarly met the peace recommendations of the three Ministers for Foreign Affairs at Paris in June 1921 by landing at Smyrna with the mien of a conqueror, and again launching a fruitless-offensive costing much life and property.. With such precedents before them my Government consider it fundamental and an&apos; indispensable condition of an armistice that the evacuation should be proceeded with&apos; as soon as the armistice is concluded. The conditions transmitted, in the note of 23rd March do not constitute a guarantee either for the evacuation or against the renewal of hostilities. In the latter eventuality they would make it necessary for the Turkish army to resume the defence of the country in unfavourable conditions resulting from prolonged control.On the other hand, we are convinced that the three Powers equally desire the earliest possible deliverance of the moslems in the occupied territory from the-unspeakable atrocities which have lasted three years, as proved by impartial European and American investigation, and which have been extended and intensified since the late armistice proposal, taking the form of wholesale massacre, destruction and rape. My Government are convinced that the proposal for evacuation on conclusion of the armistice accords with the views of the three Powers, as the armistice proposal was made with the declared intention of insuring the peaceful evacuation of Asia Minor and the restoration of Turkish sovereignty over the whole of that region.39-8 U
The Government of the Grand National Assembly, therefore, propose that the period of the armistice should be four months, being time allowed for the evacuation of Anatolia, and they agree to an automatic prolongation for a further three months if the preliminary peace negotiations should not have terminated. As regards procedure, my Government consider it necessary that the line Eskishehr-Kutahia-Afion-Kara Hissar be evacuated in 15 days and the whole of the occupied territory, including Smyrna, within four months from the beginning of the armistice. My Government would willingly agree that the evacuation and resumption of possession of the occupied territories should, take place under the supervision of the three Powers by means of mixed commissions of allied officers and Turkish and Greek representatives, these commissions to have power to regulate the modalities of the resumption of possession of the evacuated districts by the Government of the Grand National Assembly and to take measures to ensure the safety of persons and property during the operations, and that Turkish troops should only enter the restored, districts after a lapse of 15 days from the evacuation.Should the allied Powers accept the foregoing points which, as the public opinion of the world will doubtless recognize, constitute a fresh proof of the peaceful intentions of the Grand National Assembly, my Government is prepared to despatch delegates in three weeks to a town to be agreed upon to examine the peace proposals of the three Poivers.Telegraphing again [No. 195] on the same day, Sir Horace said that he had been -carefully through the telegram from Angora -with the Nationalist agent and had pointed out that whereas the Nationalists proposed that the evacuation of Asia Minor should begin, as soon as the armistice was concluded, the preamble to the armistice proposal merely referred to the three Foreign Ministers being placed in a position to make proposals for the evacuation of Asia Minor. He had also told the Nationalist agent that, he would immediately send, on the Angora telegram, but that, he did. not imagine that the proposal to divide the armistice into two periods, the Nationalists to occupy the main strategical railway at the end of the. first fortnight, would commend itself to the Greeks. The agent then expressed his personal opinion that the Turks might come to a conference without an armistice at all.On 12th April Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 169] to Sir Horace Rumbohl the following translation, of the French draft reply to the Angora Government ou the subject of the armistice in the terms of which His Majesty&apos;s Government had -concurred, on the assumption that the Italian Government similarly agreed: The French, British and Italian Governments have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Angora Governments reply dated 5th April to ihe peace proposals drawn up by the allied Powers with a view to the re-establishment of peace in the East.They are happy to take act of the Angora Governments adhesion in principle as regards the armistice, and of its acceptance both of the conditions of evacuation and the taking over of the occupied territory, and of the despatch of its delegates to a town to be selected with a view to proceeding to the examination of the peace proposals.The allied Powers find themselves, however, unable to agree to the immediate -evacuation of Anatolia upon which, the Angora Government desires to make the conclusion of the armistice dependent. The Greek Government would indeed refuse to subscribe to such a condition before the opening of negotiations ; or, were it to accept, it would be in practice impossible to prevent it from transporting its troops to Thrace, there eventually to recommence hostilities.But the allied Governments, desirous of according the greatest possible satis-faction to the demands of the Angora Government, are prepared to advance the date of the evacuation. This might be proceeded with as soon as the.body of the peace -conditions have been accepted and reserving the discussion, of any special points. They consider, further, that it would not be necessary, as the Angora Government suggests in its reply, to modify the period of the armistice since this (suspension, d arnies) is automatically renewable until the two belligerents have accepted the preliminaries of peace.The allied Powers, conscious of having in a large degree satisfied the principal demand of the Angora Government, earnestly hope that the latter will accept the armistice under the conditions indicated above.   They will be grateful if the Angora
Government will communicate the names of its representatives, and they reserve for subsequent notification the name of the town which will be proposed, for the . settle-ment of the conditions of the peace preliminaries.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Naval Appropriations Bill. Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed. [No. 190] from Washington as follows on 11tlx April:  The naval appropriations bill for a total of $233,27-1,000, reported, to the house on 8th April, is to-day available. The bill provides for 65,000 enlisted men, plus 2,000 apprentices, exclusive of 19,500 men of the marine corps. No immediate reduction in officers is proposed. The minority report proposes 80,000 enlisted men for the navy, plus 6,000 apprentices. The total sum named does not include either money for new construction, for which purpose a balance of $71,000,000 is available, or the cost of the cancellation of contracts for ships not to be completed. The estimated actual total for the naval establishment with the bill as now proposed exceeds $300,000,000.Supporters of the bill say that the personnel proposed is adequate to man all the ships of the United States navy allowed by the treaty and puts the United States on an ecpial footing with, the British navy as regards personnel. Opponents maintain that the bid entirely vitiates the 5-3 ratio.It seems probable that the bill will pass the house after considerable discussion, but amendments increasing the personnel are probable in the Senate.Telegraphing again [No. 195] on 17th April, Sir Auckland reported that an amendment to the bill proposing 86,000 enlisted men in lieu of 67,000 as laid down in the bill, had been passed by the house : 177 votes to 130. The remainder of the bill would probably be amended accordingly.
