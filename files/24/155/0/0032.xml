CHINA.The Political Situation. Mr. Clive reported as follows on 13th aud 16th June :   Li has assumed the functions of President, has accepted the resignation of the old Cabinet and appointed a new one of acting Ministers under Doctor Yen as.acting Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs.   Wu Pei-fu is named as acting Minister of War, but may refuse.   Koo declined office.On 14th June Wai-chaio-pu officially requested the foreign representatives to-notify their Governments that President Li, at the united request of public bodies throughout the country, had on 11th June taken up the duties of President of the Republic.This communication was considered at a meeting of the corps diplomatique on 15th June. The view of the majority was that as there had been no change in the form of government we were not concerned in the personality of the President and the question of recognition need not arise. The Japanese and Mexican Ministers, said they must refer to their Governments before acknowledging Wai-chaio-pu&apos;s note, but unless otherwise instructed I propose to join the majority of my colleagues in returning a formal acknowledgment on 20th June.Financial Situation. On 22nd June Mi-. Clive reported that owing to the deplorable financial situation the Chinese Government had officially suggested to the Powers concerned the suspension of the Boxer indemnity payments for a further period of two years from December nest.Disturbances in Canton. On 22nd June Mr. Clive reported that on the 16th June a movement had started at Canton against Sun Yat Sen, whose bodyguard were disarmed by Chen Chiung Ming&apos;s troops after some loose fighting. No reliable information had reached him upon the subsequent course of events, but the latest report from His Majesty&apos;? Consul-General showed that Chen Chiung Ming now had the situation completely in hand and that Sun Yat Sen was a prisoner at Whampoa until Chen Chiung Ming had decided what to do with him.Incident at Macao. On 22nd June the following report was sent by Mr. Clive :  An unfortunate incident occurred at Macao on 28th May arising out of an objection by the Chinese to the presence of Portuguese (?, negro) &quot;soldiers in a Chinese brothel. A serious local riot was finally quelled by Portuguese troops firing on the Chinese mob, when many were killed and wounded. A long explanatory statement issued by the Governor of Macao has been published in the press. The Canton Government issued an. ultimatum to Macao demanding among other things the punishment of those responsible for the firing, and a. complete boycott of Macao was put in force by the province of lvwangtung. However, the coup d&apos;etat in Canton has killed interest for the present in Macao, where His Majesty&apos;? Consul-General reports that all is now quiet and whither the Chinese are returning. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General has not been approached by either side in the matter, which has nothing to do with the old harbour question, which is temporarily quiescent under an arrangement made with the Portuguese Minister.EGYPT. .Position of Officials [F.C.1L, Ixxi, p. 2].-Lord Allenby informed the Foreign Office on 19th June that he had come provisionally to the following arrangements with the Prime Minister:-Claims for compensation will be submitted as they arise to a small committee, who will satisfy themselves that the claimants&apos; future, or condition of service, has-been prejudiced, and, if so, will recommend cases for compensation.Lord Allenby added that he was satisfied by the explicit assurances of the Prime 1 Minister that all such cases would be generously dealt with and that he should make it his duty to see that British officials were treated fairly.
G El til A NY.&quot;Upper-Silesia.   - .-;Congratulations for Sir IT. Stuart. On 17th June the following message was sent to Mr. Addison in Berlin for transmission to Sir H. Stuart; A telegram from Oppeln reports the signature of a definite agreement and the notification.of the transfer of territory.I congratulate you heartily on the successful issue of your labours. In eiroum-stances often of particular difficulty and delicacy, you have succeeded in overcoming countless perplexing problems in a manner entirely satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government, highly creditable to His Majesty&apos;s service, and warmly appreciated.I beg you to accept my thanks aud to convey them to your staff for the part they have played in ibis important achievement. - &quot;&apos; :y       . - ,GREECE.Bombardment of Samsoun. The following instructions were sent to Mr. Lindley -on 14th June : Sir H. Rnmbold reports&apos;that Greek ships of war bombarded Samsoun on 7th June for the alleged purpose of destroying stocks of munitions of war.Please make strong private representations to the Greek Government, pointing out that the bombardment, whether technically justified or not, is probably quite useless for the purpose of destroying ammunition,,and it is at this moment highly impolitic and likely to increase the difficulty of getting the Angora authorities to accept a commission of enquiry in Pontus. It will also lend colour to the Turkish contention that the Pontic district is within the zone of active hostilities, and give a fresh stimulus to the persecution of minorities.His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that the Greek Government will prohibit such bombardments in future.JAPAN.The Political Siluation.-Oa 15th June Sir Charles Eliot reported that the Prime Minister had issued a statement which was being telegraphed abroad. It was brief and conventional. There would be no change in foreign policy ; the fundamental principle of this was co-operation, especially in regard to China. Hopes were -expressed for that country&apos;s speedy rehabilitation and efforts would be made to settle the Siberian question quickly and amicably.On the following day he further reported that the Prime Minister had observed that his difficulties were internal rather than international. By this he no doubt referred to the severe criticism of his Cabinet in the press. There was a persistent -demand for a change of party as well as of ministry. It would be difficult for any other party to come into power at present, but the Seiyukai were intensely unpopular among the middle classes of the towns, and the new Cabinet was regarded as mainly -Seiyukai.PERSIA.Agreement loith Russia [F.C.R., Iv, p. 6]. Referring to Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s report, -of .19th October 1921 of the departure of a Persian Mission to Angora, Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed on 20th June that the leader of the Mission, Mumtaz-ed-Dowleh, had left the Caucasus for Angora.Anglo-American Oil Negotiations [F.C.R., Ixix, p. 4].-By telegram to Washington, dated 15th June, Sir Auckland Geddes was informed that in consequence -of certain anti-British influence, the Persian Medjliss had so amended the terms of the grant to the Standard Oil Company as to admit of the concession being granted /to the Sinclair Company instead. Sir Auckland Geddes was invited to approach the .State. Department with a view of obtaining their support, through their representative in Persia, for the Standard Oil Company, with whom the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ;are in partnership in this matter.Sir Auckland Geddes replied that on 19th and 20th June the case had been stated to both the Secretary&apos; of State and to the; Under-Secretary of State,
and that the advantage of supporting the Standard Oil Company as likely to result, in an amicable settlement had been emphasized.The force of the arguments adduced had been, recognized, but it had been intimated that the United States Government could not depart from a line of impartiality, and instructions to this effect had been sent to the United States representative at Teheran.In commenting on the .attitude of the State &quot;Department, Sir Percy Loraine, telegraphing on 24th June, observed that the Sinclair Company were now trying to. deprive the Standard Oil Company of a concession which had been voluntarily made to them. The consequent situation was that the interests of the Standard Oil Company, as opposed to those of the Sinclair Company, remained under the sole protection of the British legation.POLAND.The Cabinet. On 23rd June Mr. Hoare reported that M. Przanowski had abandoned his attempt to form a Cabinet on 21st June owing to the refusal of the Peasant party to accept M. Skirmuut as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The result so-far was a complete deadlock.TURKEY.Note from Angora. On 24th June Sir Horace Rumbold reported as follows : -I have received an advance copy of the note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Angora, which the nationalist agent here has been directed 1o communicate to all the allied and neutral heads of missions here and to the nationalist representatives, at Paris and Rome.The note, after describing the manner in which the Greek men-of-war, after the. recent bombardment of Samsoun, returned to Constantinople for munitions of war and stores, re-entered the Black Sea, and after sinking several Turkish craft, once more-returned to Constantinople, protests against the use of this port by the Greek fleet as a naval base, in spite of the neutrality proclaimed in May last year and of the fact that Constantinople is in inter-allied military occupation under the command of a British general.The note recalls the definite statements made by the Powers in their note of 26th March last, proposing a solution of the Turco-Greek conflict of absolute impartiality and neutrality; the latter indeed serving as a basis for the threat of the reprobation of the civilized world if either belligerent rejected the proposed, conditions.The note recalls a similar protest of September last year against the search: effected off Samsoun by a British destroyer on a Turkish sailing-vessel in spite of the official communique of the Supreme Council.of 10th August announcing the deter-urination of the Powers to preserve a strict neutrality between the two belligerents and in spite of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s affirmation in the House of Commons of 16th August to the effect that Great Britain was giving no support to either side in the conflict.The note complains that it was immediately after the neutrality proclamation of May last year that the Greek (? fleer) made tise of Constantinople as a naval base, for its operations in the Black Sea, and observes.that in the short space of one year the Turkish nation has thus been compelled, on many occasions, to witness the great difference between the words and the deeds of the allied Governments.After a reference to the, unfortunate impression in the minds not only of Turks, but of all moslems and the prejudice to the prospects of peace caused by the above proceedings, the note concbides with a formal protest against these systematic-violations of most solemn engagements and denounces to public opinion the attempts of the Greek Government to&apos;provoke fresh complications calculated to make peace impossible.Speech by Mustafa KemaL-Oa 24th Juue Sir Horace Rumbold also reported that Mustafa Kemal had delivered a vigorous speech at Ismid on 18th June at the reception in honour of M. Claude Farrere. The speech was strongly anti-British in tone,, though Great Britain was hot mentioned by name. He reproached the other Powers with the acceptance of the proposal for a commission of enquiry and scouted the idea that any independent country could tolerate such interference in its internal affairs.&apos; -
