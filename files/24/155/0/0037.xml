AFGHANISTAN.Appointment of Foreign Ministers. In a message from Kabul dated 3rd August, Colonel Humphrys announced the definite appointment of Tarsi as Afghan Minister in Parig. He was expected to leave Afghanistan early in the month of September in company with Ghulam Sadik, who was the Minister appointed to Berlin. On the arrival of these two Ministers in Europe, it was expected that the French and German Ministers would leave for Kabul.   .Referring to the above, Colonel Humphrys reported on 17th August that Mahomed! Ishak aud Habibulla Khan would accompany Tarsi as his secretaries, and that Ghulam. Yahiya and Mahomed Amin would proceed with Ghulam Sadik in a like capacity. The latter Minister is a brother of the Afghan Minister at Moscow.CHINA.Monthly Report. Sir Beilby Alston&apos;s monthly intelligence report was despatched from Peking on 5th September, and is as follows :  There is no improvement in the general situation. The financial position is now more acute than ever before, and neither troops, police, nor officials of the various Ministries are being paid. A minor mutiny of unpaid troops occurred outside the city on 13th August. The Chinese are beginning to be nervous about the maintenance of order in Peking, which depends on the continued loyalty to the Government of the unpaid police.The new Cabinet [F.C.R., lxxvi, p. 2] is, if anything, feebler than its predecessor, and the Premier and the Minister of Finance have not yet accepted office.Sun Yat Sen [F.C.R., Ixxv, p. 3] arrived at Shanghai on 14th August, and has since been again invited by the President to come to Peking and to take office in the Government. He is reported to be intriguing for the Presidency with various military leaders in the north who are opposed to Wu Pei-fu. Neither the President nor the Cabinet have yet been approved by Parliament, which has, so far, done no constructive work.There are no changes in the situation in Manchuria, where Chang Tso-lin remains supreme. It is reported on the authority of the Minister of Communi-cations, who is Wu Pei-fu&apos;s man, that the latter is busy reorganizing his forces for the renewal of war against Chang Tso-lin next year.Steamer navigation on the upper Yang-tze, above Ichang, has had to be suspended, owing to fighting in Szechuen, which has so far resulted in the defeat of the forces favourable to Wu Pei-fu. Kwangtung is said to be quieting down after the departure of Sun Yat Sen.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Conference between the Little Entente and Poland. On 28th August Sir George Clerk reported that a settlement had been arrived at, on the 26th, at Marienbad, of the treaty between Czecho-Slovakia and Yugo-Slavia, the text of which had not then reached him.The conference in Prague between the Little Entente and Poland had come to satisfactory conclusions on the subjects connected with the meetiug of the League of Nations representatives at Geneva. It had been agreed that, until it was clear that the candidature for official membership of the council would meet with some measure of support from the Geneva meeting, and some chance of success, no candidate should be put forward. Should, however, the Little Entente be reasonably satisfied in these respects, on a proposal by M. Benes a conclusion was come to by which the candi-dature was., left open between Czecho-Slovakia and. Yugo-Slavia. The Austrian question was to come up for discussion by the conference on the following day.
oaReferring to the foregoing message, Sir George Clerk sent the following telegram on 29th August: The official communique published this morning records a complete under-standing on all the questions discussed at the conference of the Little Entente and Poland.The Rumanian and the Serb-Oroat-Slovene Foreign Ministers told me that they found themselves in entire agreement with M. Benes and were completely satisfied with the results.Yesterday&apos;? meeting dealt with Austria, and it was agreed to devote their common efforts at Geneva to find effective means of help.Both the Serbian and the Rumanian Ministers for Foreign Affairs said they feared that England had disinterested herself in the Austrian problem. I said that I was convinced, on the contrary, that. His Majesty?s Government were desirous to find a practical solution. This made them more cheerful, but they were pessimistic of the possibility of applying any recommendations which the League of Nations might make.I said that in my opinion even though the League of Nations might not have the machinery to carry out its recommendations itself, the moral value of those recommendations for Austria and the Powers directly interested must not be under-estimated.EGYPT.Outrages against British Subjects [F.C.R., Ixxvi, p. 2].--On-25th August Lord Allenby notified that he was telegraphing a translation of a note addressed to him by the Egyptian Government relative to the recent attack on Mr. T. W. Brown and his family.In addition to this official expression of the Egyptian Governments regret, the Xing had in every case expressed to him his regret at these outrages.The following is the text of the note referred to in the immediately preceding telegram:--Your Excellency,I desire to reaffirm to Your Lordship the expression, which I have already conveyed to Your Excellency verbally, of the keen and sincere regrets of the Egyptian Government on the occasion of the attack on Mr. Brown and his family. In conveying these regrets to Your Excellency, I feel I am the faithful interpreter of the feelings both of the Egyptian Government and of all classes of the Egyptian people.This vile attack has provoked the indignation of the Government and the Egyptian people all the more in that it involved women and children. The enquiry into the crime is being prosecuted with the greatest zeal and care, under the control of the new department, the formation of which I reported to. Your Excellency in my letter of 23rd July.It is to be hoped that their enquiry will result in the discovery of the authors of the outrage, and that by exposing to us the circumstances of the crime, it will enable us accurately to diagnose its nature.It appears to me but fair to point out to Your Excellency that the British press, when enumerating or commenting on crimes already committed, is leading the British public to believe that they are the outcome of a new state of affairs which comcides with the change in the political status of Egypt.Your Excellency is aware that the great majority of criminal attacks which have been recently committed against the persons of British subjects took place during the period between December .1921 and February 1922, that is to say, before the present Ministry came into power.I should be grateful if Your Excellency would be good enough to take whatever -measures you consider useful to acquaint the British public as to the real situation with regard to these attacks, and with the fact that the Egyptian Government places :in the forefront of its labours the pursuit of the criminals.Telegraphing on -the 29th August with reference to the foregoing, Lord Allenby reported as follows : The newly constituted bureau for the investigation of political crimes has furnished me with the following information, which I consider hopeful, -although it is premature at present to pronounce any opinion.
Among the persons now under arrest, Bedreddin Bey lias identified the two who-attacked him in 1920 and 1921 respectively, and investigation of their cases has-revealed important clues, which are being followed up in connection with other cases.It is thought that four of the live persons who attacked Mr. J. W, Brown and his-family have been apprehended. Three are stated to belong to a provincial murder gang and are believed to have been hired for the crime. A fifth person, believed to-be the instigator, has been traced.Evidence in this case is considered promising but not yet sufficient for prosecu-tion before a court; it indicates that the motive of the crime was a private grudge.. -   GERMANY.The Financial Crisis. Lord D&apos;Aberuon reported from Berlin on 27th August that the conference between the Reich Ministers and the Premiers of the Federal States was to commence the following day on the subject of the economic and financial crisis. The special object of the meeting was to discuss proposals for checking the-growiug unrest amongst the working classes on account of the rise in the cost of living. Stringent measures against the import of luxuries would be proposed, as well as new regulations concerning the consumption of alcohol and tobacco. The prospect, for the winter was considered menacing in government circles..   GREECE.Enlistment Call in Smyrna. Mr. Bentinck telegraphed from Athens on 28th August that he had that day received the following from Smyrna : An order-signed by the Commander-in-Chief appeared in last night&apos;s papers, summoning all Greek subjects, and also all persons of Greek race residing in the occupied area, who-were born in 1903, to present themselves for enlistment during the last week of August,, old style, failing which they will be prosecuted as defaulters.Press Views on the Situation. On 29th August Mr. Bentinck telegraphed as-follows: There are signs in the press of restiveness provoked by the Kemalist offensive and the inability of the Government to find a solution. M. Kathemerini, hitherto a staunch supporter of M. Gounaris, warns the Government that hopes of help from Great Britain or the Venice conference are vain. Greece must herself find&apos; the solutiou. It is necessary for internal peace that the Greek army winter at home. The Allies have no army, let them remove their flags from Constantinople on the-approach of the Greek army of liberation.Other papers call on the Government to act, and there are again hints of a possible sudden movement in the direction of Constantinople.A section of the press points out that England gives Greece fair words, but that it is France which can give Greece what she wants.Further views of the press were telegraphed on 31st August by Mr. Bentinck as-follows :-The government press foresees another diplomatic demarche, on the return of the two Ministers from Smyrna, requesting support, presumably from us, to counter-balance the assistance alleged to be openly rendered to the enemy by certain Powers... If support is not forthcoming, the only course left to the Government will be to take-a certain radical measure. According to the press, the request will not only be for-financial but also for general support.The Athenaiki and a few papers still supporting the Government have been-lately suggesting, more or less openly, the necessity for the abandonment of Asia Minor.   The remainder of the press of all parties strongly opposes any such idea.Effect of the Defeat.-Mr. Bentinck reported from Athens on 3rd September-that as the reality of events became gradually known the dejection of the public became more apparent. A change of Government, possibly under the premiership of M. Sterghiades, was talked about. An ahnost unanimous press called for the-immecliate resignation of the Government.Much surprise had been occasioned by the indisposition to fight manifested by the Greek troops. The moral of the latter appeared to have been impaired by the-combined effect of dissatisfaction regarding Constantinople, concern about their home-affairs, and the knowledge that Asia Minor would have to be evacuated in any case.. Moreover, the value of the Turks&apos; artillery had provided an umvelcome shock.
: ITALY. - - rt,,r   :     (Aid to Austria. Telegraphing from Rome on 26th August, Mr. Kennard reported as follows: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs state thaLat a.&apos;meeting of the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Austrian Chancellor at Verona yesterday, the principal question discussed was the customs and monetary union between Italy and Austria, which was proposed by the Austrian Chancellor. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, while stating that he was&apos;prepared to consider the proposal, made the following reservations: (1) That careful examination must first be given to the economic effect of such a proposal on Italy. (2) That the result of action by the League of Nations must be awaited. (3) That the matter is one of great interest to other Powers, and that the Minister- for Foreign Affairs must consult other allied Governments before taking any decision.It was agreed that the 70 million lire already promised should be at once advanced to the Austrian Government, on condition that this sum shquld be devoted to covering new note circulation, and should not be employed for current expenses and public works.JAPAN.The Position in Siberia. On 26th August Sir Charles Eliot reported that he had received the following telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Vladivostock: The evacuation of Japanese troops from Spassky and other northern points to Nikolsk will commence on 26th August, The troops withdrawn will be at once sent to Japan. The further evacuation will be effected in three stages. The dates will depend on circumstances, but it is probable that the withdrawal from Nikolsk to a line drawn across the head of the peninsula between Ussuri and Amur Bays will take place about 27th September.General Dietrich is removing his headquarters to Nikolsk in a few days and intends to oppose any attempt of the Reds to push southwards. His troops will occupy Spassky when the Japanese leave, and all available men are being sent north. He is confident that he can hold the south province during the winter provided he &quot;can obtain sufficient ammunition. Ammunition is his main anxiety, and unless a sufficient, supply is available he will be obliged to cross the Chinese frontier.I understand that arrangements have been made with Chang Tso-lin to withdraw into Manchuria in case of necessity. As this would leave Vlaclivostock unprotected (? the navy) and the balance of the troops in Vladivostock would then probably proceed to Kamtchatka with as many of the local population as possible, leaving the town unprotected.The Japanese Commander-in-Chief states that no undertaking for the protection of Russian refugees has ever been given, and no steps have been taken for the purpose. So far as he was aware, no plans had yet been made for the protection of Japanese (group undecypherable), everything would depend on the outcome of negotiations with Chita. He did not see what could be clone for Russian refugees, but thought that many would escape to Saghalien in Russian boats or to Japan in Japanese boats. The only measure for protection that I can suggest would be the establishment, as in 1918, of an international guard to police the town, supported by foreign men-of-war. &apos; General Dietrich is taking steps to concentrate all invalids and refugees, women and children, probably about 20,000, oil a Russian island, but lacks funds for their &apos; maintenance, and enquires if there is any hope of obtaining financial assistance.Referring to the above message Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed on the same date as follows: &apos; I do-not consider the language of the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, reported by me last year, amounted to an undertaking, and in any case he holds that circumstances have changed since the Washington conference. The United States Government have frequently represented to the Japanese Government in the last few months that the continued presence of Japanese troops in Siberia gives rise to misunderstandings.The Japanese Government therefore feel obliged to remove their troops by the date fixed, and although they hope to make some arrangement with Chita which will avoid bloodshed, they cannot delay evacuation if no arrangement is made, or accept responsibility for the consequences. If there is danger they may remove their own subjects, but cannot undertake to remove Russians.The account given by His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Vladivostock agrees with what I have heard at the Ministry of Foreign xlffairs. They have let it be known that if 44-1 B      ;
Chita will make an agreement by which they occupy Vladivostock before the Japanese finally leave, the ammunition, now stored there, will be handed, over to- Chita. II; npt, it will bo given to whatever Government may be in power., The object,,of this seems, to. be to induce Chita to. come to, terms. At present negotiations are hanging fire.Conference with, Chita..-Sir Charles. Eliot, reported on 30th August, that the conference,with Chita,, referred to in, the foregoing telegram?,, would open at Changchun about 4th September. [Mr,, Mats.u.da.ira, the chief Japanese, delegate, was a more important person than those hitherto employed, in, these negotiations.,PERSIA.New Gabiuet-Jix his despatch to, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated Teheran, 1.8th June&quot;, Sir Percy Loraine recorded the troubles which had arisen between Serdar Sepah,,, the Minister of War, on. account of newspaper attacks against, him, and the Prime Minister, Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Matters were brought to a head by the publication in the Haqiqat of an article directed against the War Minister, who demanded the suppression of this newspaper,-failing which, he informed the Prime Minister that he would, not, ahow him to. attend, the Council of Ministers the following day..  Thereupon Mushir-ed-Dowleh telegraphed his resignation, to the Shah.The sequence to, this is- thus related by Sir Percy;-*-&quot; The Shah left the choice of a Premier to the Medjliss.. The latter pronounced in favour of Mushir-ed-Dowlelfs retention of office. The Shah ordered him to resume it, and deputations from the Medjliss begged him to do so. He hesitated for some , time, but finally consented. Two days later, however, he abandoned the task of forming a Cabinet, rendered impossible by the intrigues of various place-hunters. . I myself doubt, however, whether Mu.shir-ecl-Dowleh ever seriously intended to reconstitute his Government.The Shah then again: left the decision to the Medjliss, and the latter announced their choice of Kawam-es-Sultaneh. The Shah telegraphed his orders accordingly, and, after a further period of negotiation and intrigues, Kawam-es-Sultaneh succeeded in forming the following Cabinet,, which he presented to the Valialid and the Medjliss oil the J 7th June : -     pKawam-es-SultaneLJ -        -,  President of the Council and Minister for ForeignAffairs.Serdar Sepah -     I   -        -   Minister of War.Moh,ta,slietn-.es-Sul&apos;ta;ne.h        -   Minister of Education and Religious Endowments.Moshar-es-S,ultaneh     .       -   Minister of Justice. . :    Wahid-ul-Mulk,   &quot; - -.   Minister of Posts and Telegraphs,Amid-es-Sultaneh&apos;   ,&apos;.-,        -.   Minister of Commerce and Public, AVorlcs.Fahim-ul-Miilk.   r\.    -        -   Minister of Finance.The Ministry, of Interior remains vacant for the presentKawam-es-SultaiJeh, after presenting his Cabinet, to the Medjliss, read out a short written speech, saying that, as the Shah and the Parliament had again laid the responsibility- of government on his shoulders, he trusted in the Assembly s, support for the performance of his duties. His programme was the same as had been presented during his previous.&apos;term of office, whichhad furthermore been approved by Mushiivecl-Dowlehs Cabinet, and the principal aims of his present policy were as follows: (f) The maintenance of friendly relations with all nations and Powers,.(2) The despatch of adequate forces to quell insurgent elements.(3) To provide work for the unemployed.(4) To introduce advisers in the Finance Department(5) To use every effort to make the North Persia oil concession practicable.(6) To secure the approval of laws for the election and: formation of a jury for trying newspaper offences, as the newspapers altogether exceeded proper limits,&quot;RUSSIA.Timber Interests. -Telegraphing from Moscow on 24th. August, Mr, Hodgson reported that he had seen the&apos;manager of the Russian Timber Trust, which,has the concession of ah the forests in the Archangel district, who had just arrived at Moscow. Be had stated that he was under strict orders from the Russian Govern-ment not to touch any of the timber stocks belonging to foreign owners, and that
these orders had. been carefully observed. The stocks were, however, rapidly deteriorating from natural causes.. lie. could not give, without detailed enquiry, assurances that no British timber had. been touched, but was confident that all which was. known to be the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government, remained intact.Soviet Drastic Measures. Mr. Hodgson sent the following telegram from Moscow on 24th August: The Soviet Government has within the last few days arrested numerous professors of all branches in Moscow and Petrograd, also leading scientists, engineers, co-operators and others to the total of 100, of whom 70 from Moscow are being expelled the country, and given seven days in which to cross the frontier. These wholesale arrests are in harmony with the views expressed by Zinoviev at the recent conference, and are obviously an effort to reassert the authority of the comuxunist party, by getting rid of persons whose influence is feared as being leaders of thought in directions hostile to the communist, system. Advocates, who defended social revolutionaries, are kept, in solitary confinement, and are being banished to the Archangel district.Economic Relations with Germany. On 31st August Mr. Hodgson sent the following message : This morning&apos;s press reports that the German Charge d&apos;Affaires on 26th August made to the Commissary of Foreign Affairs a communication of the following tenour :  -Representatives of the trade unions have advised the Government that the catastrophic fall of the mark has rendered living conditions impossible for the Avorking classes. The Government has done all possible to execute the Versailles treaty, but the attitude of the trade unions ivhich were the&apos; strongest support of the policy of the fulfilment of the treaty, make it essential that creditor countries should intervene. The Russian Government is requested to take, measures to acquaint the. Russian people with the disastrous position in which Germany, in spite of all her efforts, has been placed;Karakhan replied: that the Russian people felt the keenest sympathy with Germany in her difficult position, and was confident that the treaty of Rapallo would provide a basis for the re-establishment of those economic relations with Russia.The communication of the German Government has been submitted to the Soviet Government.SERBIA.The Austrian Crisis. On 31st August Sir Alban Young sent the following message from Belgrade: In view of reports in the Serbian press of concentrations of Italian troops, and of the Italian intention to create a protectorate over Austria, the Italian Charge clAffaires has now made a further declaration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Italy will strictly observe the treaty of St. Germain, and expects others to do the same. She therefore opposes any change in the status quo, and will refrain from action in the Austrian question before coming to an agreement with the Allies and the interested neighbouring States.The Italian Charge d?Affaires at the same time enquired as to the reported concentration of Serb-Croat-Slovene troops, on the Austrian frontier, and received satisfactory assurances that no such concentration was in progress, and; that the policy of this Government was the strict observance of treaties.In continuation of this subject Sir Alban despatched the following telegram on 1st September : The Government issued a communique this morning denying the press reports as to Serbian military preparations and movements in connexion with the Austrian crisis, adding that there is, moreover, no call for such measures, as all interested parties are agreed that the political and territorial settlement under the treaty of St. Germain must be strictly respected and safeguarded.SPAIN.The Morocco Situation. On 31st August  Sir Esme Howard reported as. follows:  The King of Spain arrived at San Sebastian from Paris, and went on to Madrid the same evening.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also been called to Madrid 44-1 c
sto attend the Cabinet council on the Morocco situation, as the High Commissioner : has resigned and returned to Madrid.   The cause of resignation is said to be the &apos; refusal of the Government to send more troops to Morocco.   This refusal, if true, is not surprising, as the High Commissioner went to Morocco with instructions to end military operations and to reduce expenditure.. Papers of all shades are pessimistic and rumours of a probable government crisis are rife.Statements of the High Commissioner&apos;s resignation appear in the press generally, but up to now are denied by the War-Office, which attributes his return to reasons of health only.Sir Esme sent the following further report the next day: The High Com- -missioner, after seeing the Prime Minister yesterday, informed the press that the rumours of his resignation were completely unfounded, and that he had only come to Madrid to consult a specialist about his health. He declared that the situation in Morocco had never been so favourable to Spain. Negotiations for ransom of prisoners were proceeding favourably, and Abdelkrim losing prestige daily. Negotiations with Raisuli had had the result that for some time past not a shot had been fired in the western sector.The Prime Minister stated that there was complete accord between the Govern-, ment and the High Commissioner, who would return to Morocco as soon as his doctor allowed him. The policy of the Government regarding Morocco remained the same as stated in Parliament.Later on 1 st September Sir Esme continued- his report with the following :  In spite of the optimistic official assurances which have taken the press by surprise, it is very doubtful that there is complete agreement between the High Commissioner and the Government, or that the- situation is as rosy as painted by the former. General Burgueti&apos;s secretary in an interview really let the cat out of the bag by saying that as regards Alhucemas (? opposition) it is clear that to establish a civil protectorate it is necessary to silence the Beniurriaguel tribe. The general, he says, hopes to do. this without any loss of life, but is of opinion (grp. undec.)s must go to Alhucemas Bay for the sake of honour and to bury their dead (grp. imdec.) annual. This means that failing success in the negotiations with Abdelkrim. for entry of Spanish troops into (? Beniurriaguel) territory, the general insists on going by force. It is this which is contrary to the Governments proclaimed policy.TURKEY.International Red Cross [F.C.R., lxxvi, p. 8]. Referring to his message of I9th August, Sir II. Rumbold telegraphed on 24th August as follows: The Red Cross delegate has again emphasized the urgency of the provision of 4,0001 required to start the commissions. I told him you were fully alive to this consideration and that the United States Government had agreed to pay its share. A wireless received, yesterday states that the French have no funds from which to meet their share of the cost of enquiry.It will be most regrettable if the scheme breaks down for want of funds. Such a proof of impotence would depress the minorities as much as it would encourage the nationalists. Moreover, the reports to be furnished by the suggested commissions will presumably have a direct bearing on the nature of minority clauses in the future treaty with Turkey. I sincerely hope, therefore, that rather than abandon the scheme, and in view of the fact that it was in the first instance initiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the latter will itself make up the amount necessary to complete 4,000J.The Nationalist Offensive.-Oo. 31st August Sir Horace Rumbold made the following report:  The nationalist offensive is causing considerable uneasiness to the Constantinople Government, which feai-s that the projected preliminary conference at Venice may be prejudiced or unduly delayed, thereby. The Constantinople Government professes to toe ignorant of the reasons which have prompted this offensive, since, under the Paris proposals, Anatolia was, anyhow, to be restored to the Turks.The Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired yesterday whether the present fighting-would affect the proposals of allied Governments with regard to the holding of the preliminary conference. I replied that I thought not, but that it was not possible to say, now that fighting had started again, how the Greeks and the nationalists would respond to an invitation to attend the conference.
A. further report ou the same subject was transmitted by Sir Horace on 2nd September: Mr. Ryan asked Hamid Bey in the course pf a personal conversation on -30th August whether the present offensive was political or purely military, i.e., an -operation by which the Kemalists expected to liquidate the situation in Asia Minor definitely.Hamid Bay naturally gave no direct answer, but said that when giving him advance information about the offensive, the Angora Government had dwelt on the fact that their last note had remained unanswered for four months, and that although -one month had elapsed since the conference at Venice was first spoken of, nothing-had happened. Nothing could be now decided before the end of the fighting season, four months of which had been allowed to go by, and if the conference were unsuccessful the result would be that the nationalist army would have to remain under arms until next spring.Hamid Bey also made pointed reference to the passage in the Prime Minister&apos;? /speech of 4th August, implying that the Paris proposals might be altered to the disadvantage of Turkey. He still seemed anxious that the Venice conference should take place. He asked whether an invitation might soon be expected, and observed that it would take the Angora delegates 15 days to get to Venice.When justifying.the&quot; Kemalist decision to prevent ingress or egress of all ships during the offensive, Hamid said that this was a measure which any Government was -entitled to adopt in such circumstances. Mr. Ryan observed that the right to do so might be affected by the armistice of 1918. Hamid Bey at once said that that instrument did not apply in Anatolia. This has, of course, always been the Kemalist view, but the bluntuess of the statement is worth noting.
