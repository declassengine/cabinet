AFGHANISTAN.New Foreign Minister.-On 16th June Colonel Humphrys reported that Mohammed Wali Khan had succeeded Tarsi as Foreign Minister.BRAZIL.Revolutionary Movement. On 5th July Sir John Tilley reported from Rio cle Janeiro that following the arrest and- subsequent- release of Marshal Hermes da Fonseca on 26th June, a revolutionary movement had broken out early that morning at the military camp of Villa Militar, near Rio, and at one of the harbour forts. No reliable details were yet available about the former, but the fort had been bring at intervals all day and some shells had fallen in the city.The Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the situation, though serious, appeared to be in hand and that according to the-latest reports the outbreak at Villa Militar had been quelled. The fort was still holding out and might do so for some time, though the garrison was small.Various rumours were current about Marshal Fonseca; some said that he had been re-arrested and others that he had disappeared. The city was strongly policed, the shops were shut and police charges had occurred. Reliable information was hard to get.CHINA.Intelligence Report. Mi&apos;. Olive sent the following report from Peking on 5th July;--&apos; : :    &apos;&quot;      ,: - .Y -\, . %&apos;CS?.-: ;:.vi-ds:V.yWAll hostilities in the north have ceased as a result of the Shan-Haikuan armistice and the consequent withdrawal of Chang Tso-hVs troops beyond the wall.Chang Tso-lin has not yet been reinstated, nor has he cancelled the independence -of-Manchuria, for-which .there is, however-, no desire locally;-and a compromise settlement between him and the new Peking Government is probable.The assumption of office by the new President seems, on the whole, to meet with the approval of the country, though it was violently denounced by Sun Yat Sen&apos;s-party before the latteFs fall. The President^ programme includes unification, the abolition of tuchuns, and the disbandment of troops, but he is likely, as before, to-be a mere figure-head. The prospects for unification on the lines of a federal republic of autonomous provinces, which appear to depend largely on co-operation between -Wu Pei-fit and Chen Ghiung Ming, are at present more favourable than for some years past, provided these two maintain their supremacy in the north and south respec-tively. There are, however, persistent rumours of friction, between Tsaokun and Wu, and the latter has retired to his former base at Loyang. Meanwhile no repre-sentatives of the south have yet openly joined the Peking Government. The old parliament is expected to assemble here with a quorum on or before 1st August.The new Peking administration is in severe financial straits, and there is much talk of financial reorganization - by means of large funding and of advances from banks to tide over the interval.There have not been further developments at Cantou, where the position remains -obscure. Chen Ghiung Ming is still at Waichow, but his troops control Canton. Sun so far has refused to resign and leave Kwangtung, and Chekiaug seems reluctant to proceed to extremes against him, apparently hoping to secure his voluntary withdrawal. The President has telegraphed to Sun inviting him to come to Peking, which would mean recognition of Li as President, but no reply has been received. Wutingfang died on 23rd June. Suu&apos;s anti-north expedition has been successful in the invasion of Kiangsi, but a portion of his force has declared for Chen and presumably there will be no further advance northward. Much depends on the attitude of the radical general Liliehchun, who is expected to remain loyal to Sun.
EGYPT.Dismissal of Officials. In. reply to a request for information Lord Allenby reported as follows on 1st July :---The Egyptian- Government have dismissed (a) some 2Q minor officials .in the public works department, and (b) some 10. higher officials in the projects department.in regard to (a), the decision , to dismiss, intended to. have effect in April 1922, was taken, in April 1921. with the definite object of making room for Egyptians, but has only now been put into operation. .... -. - ,. .lit regard to (b), the projects department was abolished in. the spring of this year and for reasons of economy the. higher officials have, received notice, of dismissal. These are all Europeans, not, Egyptians, occupying higher posts. . Dismissal notices will shortly be issued to a considerable number of lower officials in. the same depart-ment, both foreign and Egyptian. .. ,.I presume the report; in the Morning Post referred to. (a). Although the reasons may have been political, the primary object of ,the dismissals was to make .room for. Egyptian engineers, which the engineering school had recently turned out in larger numbers than before. To train and employ such Egyptians has always been part of the policy of. Mis Majesty&apos;s Government and the dismissals in question would, equally have occurred in the normal course if there had been, no declaration of Egyptian independence.   . - . ,-,I understand it has been the practice of the Egyptian Government to give contract officials an indemnity&apos; on the termination, of their contracts as provided in the pension law of 1909 for such, officials if retired for reasons: of ill-health. In the note presented by the Egyptian delegation to the Foreign:Office in October .19^1 they admitted moral liability in connexion with such cases: to indemnify on a-higher scale, and I have no reason to suppose this will be refused in the present case. It is also open to such officials to claim damages in a mixed court for renvoi intempestif. In regard to the contract officials it had been my intention.to ask for compensation for those who were dismissed to make room for Egyptians, but not for those dismissed for reasons of economy. It appears, - however, likely to be so difficult, to distinguish between these two classes that, as at present advised, I propose to urge the Prime Minister to grant indemnities to.all contract officials dismissed, and on. a larger scale than that hitherto prevailing. This, in my opinion,. is as much as can be expected from the Egyptian Government in respect of contract officials, whose right to any compensation at all is in most cases doubtful.I deprecate the suggestion that 1 should ask for the support of my foreign colleagues. Such action would be detrimental to our special position here. I have, however, informed the Italians and am informing the Belgians, both of whom at one time asked for my assistance, that their nationals might present their claims to my committee, and the Italian Minister has agreed. I do not, however, think it desirable to do so in the case of the French and the Greeks until they approach me in the matter.I have made it clear in my previous telegram that there can be no question of pressing for the application of my scheme even in the case of pensionable officials, although in effect it will form the, basis of the compensation of individual claims which, when approved by me, the Prime Minister will accept,GERMANY.The Rathenau Conspiracy. On 29th June Lord d&apos;Abernon reported from Berlin that the authorities, had investigated the Rathenau conspiracy with extraordinary energy and skill and had been supported by the general public to a degree unprecedented in cases of this kind. Most of the conspirators, and one at least of the assassins had been arrested. It appeared certain that the plot was.hatched by the Erhardt secret society &quot; consul &quot; who was responsible for the murder of Erzberger and which was closely affiliated to many political organizations of the extreme Right.,  Financial Position. The following report was sent by Lord d&apos;Abernon on 2ndJuly:-     : . &quot;     ;- In its final paragraphs, the banks report of .1.0th June suggests that Germany&apos;s financial position- may be threatened with serious danger during the interval between their*report and the conclusion of the subsequent negotiations.
Yesterday the exchange fell to 1,750, compared with 1,315 when the hanks wrote,., with 732 at the time of the Cannes conference, and with 247 in May 1921 at the time .of the ultimatum. The contingency or catastrophe they apprehended is therefore imminent. &apos; There is grave danger that protracted negotiations for a large and long-term loan will mature too late if not preceded by immediate help.The negotiations of the committee of guarantee here proceeded fairly smoothly, and the German Government appears disposed to afford the necessary information and to accept moderate control. But while these negotiations are going on the exchange is collapsing. Unless immediate measures are taken to prevent its con-continuation and an aggravation of the exchange crisis, the whole financial position will crumble into the Austro-Polish phase. I am informed that the payment due 15th July will be met, but the necessary remittances are only achieved by issuing enormous quantities of paper money here a policy leading to inevitable disaster.My considered opinion is that the whole future of reparations is being com-promised by the delay in reform or in relief either by loan or otherwise.    The enormous fall in the exchange indicated above has already diminished to a serious extent the prospect of effective payment by Germany.He further reported as follows on 7th July : The financial crisis grows rapidly worse. The exchange has fallen from 1,750 last week to 2,370 to-day, and efforts of the Reichsbank to stop the fall have proved unavailing.Meanwhile negotiations continue between the German Government and the guarantee committee, but are mainly concerned with details and futilities which have no vital or urgent importance, and have no bearing on the emergency measures which are necessary to save a catastrophe.The payment of the 50 million marks gold due by Germany on 15th July will apparently be made, but the effort has broken the market. . The policy of forcing these payments is most doubtful. In the week ending 30th June more than 12 milliards of newr fiduciary notes were issued.Upper Silesia. .       ,The Situation.  On 2nd July Sir AY. Heneker reported as follows from Oppeln :  During the last few days the disorderly elements of the German population have been very active. British as well as French detachments conveying arms, &amp;c. to Gleiwitz for distribution by the inter-allied control commission have been attacked. On 30th June the French patrol in Hindenburg was attacked, and in the fighting the French had one soldier killed and four wounded, whilst the assailants are reported to have had 21 killed and many wounded. Yesterday a French orderly in Gleiwitz was assaulted and killed by a crowd-.On 1st July, at La band, a small French detachment escorting three prisoners to Gross Strehlitz- was attacked and the prisoners released, one French soldier being wounded and three of their assailants killed or wounded. Yesterday trains transporting French troops from Gleiwitz were heavily fired upon, and great difficulty is expe-rienced in getting the German engine drivers and shunters to remain at work under fire! A special force consisting of armoured cars and two companies of French infantry, and also two companies of the Black Watch, are proceeding to Gleiwitz to hold the high ground round the railway station in order to protect the troops and railway personnel when the town is being evacuated to-morrow.Two companies of. the 60th Rifles are proceeding to Peiskretschan to-day in order to aid the French and Italians to entrain on the, evacuation of the town. Dr. Eckardt, the German plenipotentiary, has been requested to use his influence and authority in putting an end to these acts of war, but he, while deploring the incidents, expresses himself and his Government powerless, and openly states that when the German troops arrive they will have to shoot down these bands of Selbstschutz, which have got completely out of hand.GREECE.New Customs &quot;Tariff. On 27th June Mr. Lindley reported from Athens that bills augmenting the customs tariff had been submitted to the Chamber: Some 60 classes of goods in the tariff had been raised), the new duties ranging from twice to fifteen times the former amount. The conventional tariff on coffee &quot;had been abolished altogether and there would be now only one, and an increased tariff for
JAPAN.Siberia. Sir Charles Eliot reported on 28th June that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when speaking of the evacuation of the Maritime Province of Siberia, had said that the majority of Japanese residents were caterers for the troops and that when the troops were withdrawn the Japanese population would be comparatively small. The naval force would be increased for their protection. He also indicated his hope that negotiations with Chita would be resumed soon, and gave me to under-staud that preliminary discussions were already taking place in Tokyo with a representative of that Government,Washington Treaties. On 4th July Sir Charles Eliot informed the Foreign Office that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him, with reference to newspaper statements, that all the Washington treaties had been approved by the Privy Council and were awaiting a &quot; convenient opportunity for ratification,&quot; which would probably occur when the Prince Regent returned from Hokkaido. Sir Charles added that it-seemed to him clear that they were really waiting to see whether any European. Powers would make reservations.Naval Programme.Sir Charles Eliot reported on 5th July that the naval programme which had just been announced provided for the construction of 8 large-42-2 this article. In collection (one gr. nndec.) the value of the gold drachma was to be equivalent to 5 &quot;60 paper, as the sterling rate fixed by the consortium was now 140 drachma? to the pound.All the above was in force from 24th June. The importation of some 18 classes of so-called luxury articles would be prohibited altogether for six months, such goods comprising silk, lace, feathers, crystal, sweets, &amp;c. This prohibition, however, could not take place till the bills in question had been passed and become law.   The new bills were causing consternation in business circles.The Military Situation.-On 28th June Mr. Lindley reported that M. Sterghiades had called that morning and informed him that he had been summoned by the Greek Government, with whom he had not yet conferred officially, and that this personal views of the situation were as follows: He was opposed to retirement to the new line of defence because it would raise the moral of the Kemalists, which was waning. It would afford them additional resources in men and material. It would entail on the Greek authorities expenses for the maintenance of refugees equal at least to the saving effected by diminishing the number, of troops. It would be necessary for the Greeks to destroy railways and probably villages, which would cause an outcry abroad. It would probably corn-promise the allied defence of the Straits. Nevertheless, he believed, that the new commander-in-chief, of whom he spoke well, was in favour of such a retirement.Although the Kemalists were much less strong than last year, he did not think that the Greek Government could safely withdraw more than two or three divisions, which afforded no great saving. The matter had reached a complete deadlock, since the Greek Government could not continue the war alone for financial reasons and would not evacuate and leave the population to be massacred or to flee to Greece for. political reasons. A catastrophe could only be avoided by the Powers making up their minds to enforce some decision. Greece would accept the decision though Kemal would not, since war was necessary to his position. But with allied moral and financial support for one year Greece would wear the Kemalists clown and establish a durable peace.On the following day Mr. Lindley further reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the situation had been examined in a council presided over by the King and had been found, absolutely favourable from the military point of view ; at the same time the general, feeling was that the financial situation, made it imperative to find some way out of the existing deadlock. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had added that he did not believe that the Powers would be able to come to any agreement amongst themselves, and that Greece must therefore try to solve the problem herself. Mr. Lindley added that his impression was that the visit of M. Sterghiades and the commander-in-chief would have no practical result and that no decision of importance would be taken in the near future.
cruisers, 24 destroyers and 22 submarines, by the fiscal years to 1928. This repre-sented a moderate reduction in destroyers arid, submarines On the original eight and. the eight of the programme.PERSIA.Political Situation [F.C.R., lxxi, p. 4].-On 2nd July Sir Percy Loraine reported satisfactorily on the attitude of the Prime Minister, who was displaying a certain amount of energy. This had been directed largely towards disciplining the press; and while he had already exercised his power of suppressing certain newspapers, he had notified the intention to punish press attacks directed against foreign officials or their Governments. As a means of re-establishing his own good name, and of restoring the credit of his Government, Sir Percy had urged, on the Prime Minister the necessity of the Government meeting their obligations.Representation in the Hejaz. Telegraphing from Constantinople on 30th June, Sir Horace Rumbold sent the following report:- The Persian representative at Cairo has informed the Persian:Government that the King of the Hejaz wishes to make the acceptance of the official, who has just passed through Constantinople to take charge of the Persian consulate-general at Jeddah during the pilgrimage season, conditional on the recognition of the Hejaz Government by the Persian Government,No such question has been raised in previous years. The Persian Ambassador begs me to ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to use their good offices to ensure the acceptance of the Consul-General. as in the past, leaving the question^! recognition of the Hejaz Government tp be settled in due course.American Advisers [F.C.R., XVIII, p. 3]. The following message was sent by Mr. Chilton from Washington on 7th July : The State Departments recommendation for the post of financial adviser is Mr. A. C. Millspaul, who has held the post of economic adviser in the State Department for the last five years or so. I gather before entering the State Department he was a schoolmaster.   I will endeavour to obtain further details.He is now discussing with the Persian Minister the question of his powers, salary, &amp;c, before accepting the appointment.Anglo-American Oil Negotiations [P.O.R., Ixxii, p 3],  On 28th June Sir Percy Loraiue sent a summary of certain proposals lodged, by the Sinclair Company with the Persian Government which the Prime Minister had telegraphed to the Persian Minister at Washington with a view to obtain the observations of the Standard Oil Company thereon. The first of these proposals was that participation in the northern concession should be exclusively confined to Americans and Persians. Sir Percy Loraine regarded this as an infringement of the open door principle for which the Government of the United States so strongly contended.POLAND.The Government-On 29th June Mr. Hoare reported from Warsaw that a non-party Government had been formed under M. Sliwinski, vice-president of the Warsaw municipality and a strong supporter of the Chief of the State; M. Narutowicz, delegate at Genoa, was Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Michalski had refused the Ministry of Finance, which remained to be filled.ReuteFs Warsaw correspondent telegraphed on 7th July that this Government had. resigned,SYRIA.Ibn Saudis Agents.- On 3rd July Mr. Palmer reported the presence in Damascus of certain persons who were working in favour of Ibn Sand and Wahabi principles.TURKEY.Russian Refugees [F.C.R., LXVI, p. 10]. The following report was sent from Constantinople by Mr. Henderson on 1st July : Dr. Naneen recently telegraphed to Colonel Proctor (Constantinople Relief Fund lor Russians) requesting him to approach the High Commissioners here with a view
to ah urgent appeal being sent to the French and Italian Governments to subscribe a share of the 30,000/.. which the League of Nations has been asked to contribute for Russian relief here. If this sum is not forthcoming the offer of the American relief administration to assist in relief measures will be withdrawn.Owing to lack of means, the Constantinople relief fund cannot continue the rationing of refugees hitherto undertaken by that committee. A. serious situation is likely to arise if thousands of Russians are thus thrown on the street, and ultimately the Governments of the occupying Powers will be compelled to furnish funds to meet&apos; the situation. I urged these and other similar considerations on my allied colleagues, who undertook to telegraph their Governments accordingly.The French High Commissioner now informs me that the French Government, who have subscribed vast sums in the past for the upkeep of Russian refugees, have declined to make any subscription. It would be unfortunate if the opportunity of obtaining American assistance were lost owing to failure of the League to subscribe this comparatively small sum. Would it be possible, in view of the fact that the occupying Powers must ultimately be responsible, thereby possibly incurring yet&apos; greater expenditure, to urge the French Government to reconsider its decision ?
