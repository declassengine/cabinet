AFGHANISTAN.The Khyber Railway.-Telegraphing [No. 22] from Kabul on 18th May Colonel Humphrys reported that he had had an interview with Tarsi the clay before, and in reply to an enquiry as to why we were building a railway in Khyber had said that we were doing it for the purpose of drawing Afghanistan and Great Britain more closely together. It foreboded no aggressive action against Afghanistan. Every country had the right to extend its railway system up to its frontiers for the purposes of commerce and defence ; and the intention to build this railway had been communicated, nearly two years ago, to the Afghan delegates at Mussoorie. Tarsi said that the railway was causing great anxiety to the general staff, and he would convey these assurances to the commander-in-chief of the Afghan army.The Bohharan Rebellion. On 23rd May Colonel Humphrys telegraphed [No. 23] from Kabul that he had discussed the Bokharau rebellion with Tarsi, who after much talking had reluctantly admitted that the employment of force on behalf of the revolutionaries would be contrary to Afghan interests. But he, Tarsi, had implored his, Colonel Humphrys&apos; support towards the fulfilment of the Amir&apos;s cherished dream of freeing Bokhara of Russian troops. He had told Tarsi that His Majesty&apos;s Government entertained the most friendly feeling towards Afghanistan, but would continue to maintain an attitude of the strictest neutrality towards Bokhara. He had added that he welcomed the frequent interchange of views between themselves which Tarsi had proposed ; and Tarsi had said that he would like to continue the discussion of this subject at an early date.ARABIA.Mudayyanism. On 18th May Major Marshall reported [No. 30] from Jeddah that recent reports had shown that Mudayyanism was spreading quickly in the Hejaz. In the south Ghamid and Zarhan and in the east Kunfuda had joined them, whilst in the north the situation of Emir Ali at Bueir was said to be precarious. It was rumoured that the Mudayyana have occupied Madain Saleh. He thought that the possibility of the Muddayana overrunning the Hejaz in the near future should be kept in view, because Medina was threatened in the north and the communications between Jeddah, Mecca and Taif were threatened from the south. The Hejaz tribes were afraid of the Mndayyana and would rather join them than resist.CHINA.The Financial Situation. The following telegram [No. 175] was sent from Peking by Sir Beilby Alston on 24th May :-The corps diplomatique decided on 18th May to. wait until the military situation became clearer before considering the financial situation. My Japanese, United States and French colleagues have discussed the situation unofficially with myself, and we have agreed to address the following identic telegram to our Governments : (1) The civil war appears to be nearing an end. The cessation of hostilities will, however, not resolve the situation. The victorious General Wu Pei-fu is considered to be no politician, and declares his only object is to summon a parliament which should elect a president and frame a constitution. Meanwhile, the administration is completely disorganized, the treasury is empty, and the worst expedients are resorted to.   The first necessity, therefore, is financial.(2) With the retirement or Chang Tso-lin in the north and the set-back to Sun Yat-sen in the south, there is a better prospect of unification and disbandment than heretofore.(3) The above-mentioned Ministers consider the moment opportune to recommend to their respective Governments that they be authorized, at such time aud in such form and under such conditions as circumstances may render expedient, to urge in a friendly manner upon the Chinese Government, and the putting into effect of, resolution No. &apos;.) adopted by the Washington conference with regard ,to the reduction of the Chinese military forces, and the expenditures which, as the preamble thereto indicated, would contribute to political unity, financial rehabilitation and a stable and effective government.
(4) Snck friendly suggestion, if it is to produce results, should be accompanied by an offer of financial assistance.   This assistance might be given, in the first, instance, on the receipt of satisfactory assurances and, subsequently, on the actual compliance with the resolution of the Washington conference mentioned in the-preceding paragraph.(5) The consortium council of London on 16th May declared that &quot; administrative loans are at piresent impossible until there is a reasonable prospect of stable govern-ment&quot; ; the four Ministers understand this to imply that, administrative loans are possible as soon as a reasonable prospect of stable government appears, and they believe such prospect now exists.(6) The four Ministers are of the opinion that if they wait for China to reform herself it means abandoning her to anarchy and disruption, and that, even if their friendly suggestion is not accepted, they will have lost nothing by offering it.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Commercial Treaty with Russia. Telegraphing [No. 79] from Prague on 20th May, Sir George Clerk reported that the Secretary-General to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Girsa, had remained in Genoa to arrange with the Russians the details of a commercial treaty, the draft of which had been initialled by both sides three days before this report. Sir George had been told by the Prime Minister that the treaty was purely commercial, and that it did not imply de jure recognition of the Soviet GovernmentFINLAND.Resignation of the Foreign Minister.- On 21st May Mr. Reunie reported [No. 69] that the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been accepted and that the Prime Minister had temporarily replaced him.GREECE.New Cabinet [FC.R., lxix, p. 3]. Telegraphing [Nos. 183 and 187] from Athens on 18th and 20th May, Mr. Lindley reported that, M. Stratos having resigned on an adverse vote in the Chamber, a new Oovernment had been formed.The late Minister of Finance was Prime Minister and M. Stratos Minister of the Interior. All the old Ministers, including M. Gounaris, retained office and some new posts had been created.ITALY.Commercial Treaty loith Russia. On 27th May Sir Ronald Graham telegraphed [No. 196] that the press reported the signature of an Italian-Russian commercial treaty on 23rd May. The text had not yet been published, but the treaty was said to provide for full liberty of circulation for Italian subjects in Russia, the most favoured nation treatment for Italian industries and professions in Russia and vice versa, the immediate conclusion of a special agreement regarding labour and emigration, and the validity in Russia of contracts with an arbitration clause. It was further said to provide for reciprocal free transit, a free zone for Russia at Trieste and for Italy in the Black Sea ports, options for Italy for oil wells not yet accorded to other countries, and agricultural concessions in the Ukraine and Kuban.JAPAN.Demands at the Dairen Conference. Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 130] as follows from Tokyo on 19th May ; The agents of the Chita Government have published in China (? 17) demands said to have been made by the Japanese at the Dairen conference, and this document has been reproduced in the Japanese press.The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that it was &quot; manufactured &quot; by the Chita Government, and that in particular the Japanese delegates never asked that Japan should be given a (? 30) (? years&apos;) lease of northern Saghalien or that Nikolaievsk should be made a free port; but they did propose that fortifications on the coast of the Korean frontier should be forbidden and that existing fortifications in these areas should be destroyed. His Excellency said that the Chita. troops had abstained from aggression recently, but that otherwise there was no change in the Siberian situation. The Japanese merchants of Vladivostock were very much discussed-satisfied and wished to leave. They had applied to the Japanese Government for financial assistance, but that could not be given.
Troops in Manchuria.-On. 27th May Sir Charles Eliot reported [Ho. 135] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had assured him (? effusively) that no (? additional) troops were being sent to Manchuria, although certain troops there were being relieved. The military attache had confirmed this. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that so far the Japanese Government saw no ground for serious appre-hension. The situation, however, would become grave if Wu Fei-Fu advanced beyond &apos;Shan-haikuan.PERSIA.The Political Situation [F.C.R., lxix, p. 4].-Referring to his telegram [No. 220] on 21st May, Sir Percy Loraine sent [No. 228 J the. following message : -The Shah replied ordering Mushir-ed-Dowleh to resume office ; but he has not yet consented, and apparently makes the limitation of the Minister of Wars powers conditional.On 23rd May Sir Percy continued [No. 230] with the following: Mushir-ed-Dowleh has resumed office; some changes in the Cabinet are contemplated.Two days afterwards the situation called for the following telegram [No. 234]: -Mushir-ed Dowleh has abandoned the task of forming a Government; his failure is apparently clue to the intrigues of place hunters.On 27th May Sir Percy telegraphed [No. 235] that the Minister of War, who was carrying on under the special authority of the Shah, pending the formation of a Government,, had approached him through the Under-Secretary of State for Finance, with a view to getting advances on the revenues and on oil royalties respectively. Sir Percy Loraine had replied that he was unable to interfere with the freedom of the bank to make advances if it wished, but that in his opinion the bank would be quite justified in refusing on the ground that there was no Government, and in that he would be unable to press it.The MinisteFs messenger, while admitting the reasonableness of Sir Percy:s attitude, did not conceal the danger that was hanging over Persia if no one came to her assistance at the present juncture. Sir Percy pointed out that Persi.a&apos;s present trouble was the consequence of the policy of successive Governments, which had certainly not laid Great Britain under any obligation to tender her assistance.Sir Percy suggested that the formation of a Government might, be hastened by his refusal to entertain the proposals which had been made to him. He was apprehensive, however, that the desperate financial situation might lead to the fall of Reza, with whom the last visible elements of stability would disappear,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA..Asia Minor.-Sir Auckland geddes telegraphed [No. 247] as follows from Washington on 21st May : A member of my staff was informed yesterday by the Under-Secretary of State that the State Department had been anticipating that a proposal would be made to investigate the situation also in the regions in Greek occupation. The Under-Secretary of State implied that, had such a proposal not been made, the assent of the United States Government to take part in investigations in eastern Anatolia would in any event have been impossible. The Secretary of State hoped, he said, to return a definite reply within a few days.The Under-Secretary proceeded to express grave concern at the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in making public the names of American relief workers who had given information in regard to Turkish outrages (see statement made in the House of Commons on 15th May). Not only is the personal safety of these workers thereby imperilled, but their future usefulness must also be impaired. The incident was particularly surprising having regard to the care which His Majesty&apos;s Government usuaUy exercise iu such matters.The representative of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, while expressing regret that anything should have been done which could provoke concern on the part of the United States Government, pointed out that the State Department would now probably feel it all the more desirable to obtain first-hand information in regard to the situation,, and to make it clear to the Turks that American citizens in Anatolia must be subjected to no annoyances of any kind.
