ALBANIA. -Serbian Attitude. Telegraphing from Durazzo on 10th July, Mr. Eyres reported that the Albanian Government had not associated themselves with the action of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government in approaching the Great Powers regarding Albanian postal arrangements with Italy. Nothing was known of this procedure until the Serbian Charge d&apos;Affaires informed the Government. Such action indicates a claim on the part of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government to put their finger in the Albanian pie, and it appeared to Mr. Eyres that a. good understanding between Italy and Albania was distasteful to the Charge d&apos;Affaires or his Government as being unfavourable to Jugo-Slavian interests.ARGENTINA.Status of Legations. Mr. Chalkley telegraphed on 14th July as follows : The Argentine Government yesterday sent messages to Congress recommending that the legations in Brazil and Chile should be raised to embassies. Immediate sanction is assured as Brazil and,Chile have taken reciprocal action. . .:-    iCHINA.Financial Situation- On 12th July Mr. Give reported as follows : At a conference- on 7th July of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the: chairman of the Financial Commission (Wellington Koo), and others, with the Ministers of the allied and associated Powers on the subject of the suspension of indemnity payments, the Prime Minister in the course of conversation expressed the intention of funding the floating debt, both external and internal, on the security of the 2i per cent, customs surtax. ; *;The representatives of France, Great Britain, Japan and the United States, considering that there are great difficulties in the way of obtaining the unanimous assent of the principal Powers to the Chinese request for the further suspension of the Boxer indemnity payments, at the same time being desirous of assisting the Chinese Government in its present financial embarrassment and in view of their declared intention to proceed.. with the disbandment of troops, make the following recommendation for the consideration of their respective Governments, namely, that the consortium banks should be authorized on the application of the Chinese Government to make advances not exceeding $15,000,000, spread over a period of six.months, to be added to the floating debt and secured, on the above-mentioned surtax or otherwise as the consortium banking group may determine, subject to the supervision and audit, with foreign assistance, of this expenditure and to the further condition that the Chinese Government definitely pledges itself forthwith and concurrently with the said advance to negotiate and conclude with the consortium a definite agreement providing for the consolidation of the internal and external floating debt.Provision for the disbandment of troops within a stated period and for the regulation of future borrowing should form part of the arrangement.Although matters are still unsettled in the south and troubles continue in several provinces, there is undoubtedly a widespread feeling in favour of unification, and&quot; the old Parliament with many of the southern members is expected to meet next, month in Peking.But in any case, if this preliminary advance of $2,500,000 per month for six months is riot made, the representatives of the four Powers consider it doubtful if the present provisional Government can carry on or if any other Government would be more successful. No reconstructive programme can be put through without financial assistance from outside. - frj
To this the Earl of Balfour replied on 19th. July, saying :-We cannot agree to the 2\ per cent, customs surtax being utilized as security for loans in anticipation of the findings of the tariff commission as to the allocation of increased customs revenues.  , - -   - , &apos;Before considering the question of a loan we require deiinite information on the following points : (1) What precisely does external and internal floating debt represent ? What is its amount and in what form does it exist ?(2) How will a loan of $15,000,000 spread over six months, and presumably&apos; intended to meet ordinary current expenditure, materially assist the re-constructive programme for China, and how is it expected that the position will be improved at the end of six&quot; months ?       &apos; -(3) How is it proposed to exercise supervision and audit over the expenditure of $15,000,000 and what likelihood is there of the Chinese accepting this proposal ?(4) How can disbandment of troops within a stated period be provided for, seeing that Chang-Tso-Lin is consolidating his position in Manchuria, thereby necessitating the maintenance of the rival armies ?(5) Do you consider that the present Government is sufficiently stable to justify the belief that it will establish effective control over China as a whole or the greater part of it, which is the chief ground for granting financial assistance ?(6) What consequences do you apprehend from a refusal to grant financial assistance?On 17th July Mr. Clive reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the Chinese Government agreed to the French scheme for the re-establishment of the bank by means of bonds secured on the indemnity, leaving, however, part of the latter to be applied to education.;        - , .,: lt)!,The agreement provided for the French consent to two years&apos; suspension of the indemnity if compatible with the re-establishment of the scheme.On 20th July he reported as follows:  The insolvency of the Chinese Government has become so chronic that, an impression may exist that they will always get out of their difficulties somehow.. ,The following facts have brought matters to a head : (1) The Minister for Foreign Affairs was mobbed by unpaid officials on leaving aCabinet meeting.   The remainder of the Cabinet bolted by the back door. (2) The Peking-Mukden railway, the most prosperous line in China, is being run at a heavy loss owing to the retention by Chang-Tsodin of three-quarters of the rolling stock.(3) The mutiny of some of Wu Pei-fu&apos;s unpaid soldiers resulted in the Minister for Foreign Affairs being forced to raise, at exorbitant interest, from the Bank of China, $500,000, to be repaid from the already overcharged salt surplus.(4) Threats have been received from several more provinces of the retention of salt revenues, with which to pay troops, &amp;c. The*Government literally have no funds, and at the interview yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs said the Cabinet intended to place the financial situation before Parliament, as soon as it met next month, with a proposal for the funding scheme outlined in the telegram of 12th July. If Parliament refused it, the Cabinet would go and probably Parliament would disappear. But he did not believe there would be much opposition. Everyone knew that there was no money and something must be clone.His Excellency realizes that the conditions will be stringent, and the Chinese--would certainly not come on their knees to the consortium except in the last resort.CZECHO SLOVAKIA.Hungary and the League of Nations. On 20th July Sir George Clerk reported that a proposal, made by the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, that the Governments of the Little Entente should support the request of the Hungarian Government for admission to the League of Nations, had been accepted.
EGYPT,The Attack on Colonel PiggotL-On 18th July. Lord Allenby reported that Sarwat Pasha, who was in Cairo when the attempt was made and&apos;had visited Colonel Piggott in.hospital, had called upon him to express the regret of the Egyptian Government., lie fully realized their grave responsibility and discussed at length the&apos; measures -which should be taken to elucidate and stop these political crimes&apos;. : ::: . &apos; 1    !; ,;&apos;On 18th July the Earl of Balfour instructed Lord Allenby that in- view of the frequency and impunity with which these outrages were perpetrated he should warn the Egyptian Government that if this campaign of political crime against British officers aud officials was not definitely stopped and severe measures were not taken to discover and punish the culprits, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelled to take a most serious view of the matter. .GERMANY.Internal Politics. On 18th July Lord d&apos;Abernon reported that the internal political crisis was temporarily settled. The Government had secured the requisite majority for the defence of the republic law. No alteration in the composition of the Government would be made until October, by which time it was anticipated that the fusion of the majority Socialists and the independent Socialists would be complete. The Reichstag would adjourn immediately.HUNGARY.Bandits on the Frontier. On 20th July Mr. Akers Douglas reported from Vienna that the Minister, for Foreign Affairs had called on him that day, and on behalf of the-Austrian Government had expressed great anxiety on account of the reappearance of Hungarian bands in Burgenland.An attack had. been made on the frontier village of Hagersdorf, and further attacks were feared. The Austrian Government have made representations to the Hungarian Government to preserve the peace on the frontier and to keep the neutral zone clear of bands. In the present critical situation of Austria these incidents create dangerous excitement and serious possibilities.In regard to which Mr. Hohler reported, on 21st July, that the Austrian Minister-had informed him that morning that there was every evidence that the Hungarian Government was acting energetically and in good faith, and that he believed that the-bandits had been dispersed or captured and the incident ended.JAPAN.Saghalin. On 13th0 July the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir Charles Eliot in Tokyo that there was no present intention of withdrawing the troops, from the island of Saghalin. It was, however, proposed to withdraw about 1,000 men: stationed in the mainland province of that name. His Excellency hoped for the-early resumption of, negotiations with Chita, but stated that the troops would be withdrawn from the mainland as promised whether the negotiations were successful or not.LATVIA.New Cabinet. On 14th J uly Mr. Lowden telegraphed from Riga as follows: -The Latvian Cabinet has resigned owing to the refusal of the constituent assembly to sanction the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture. It is expected that the Prime Minister, M. Meierovics, will form another Cabinet with practically the same Ministers except the Minister of Agriculture, M. Samuels.In reference to the foregoing Mr. Lowden sent, the following telegram on 20th July : The new Cabinet has taken office. The only change is the appointment of M. August Kalnin in place of the former Minister of Agriculture.
LITHUANIA.Political Prisoners. Mr. Dilley telegraphed from Kovno in the following terms on 11th July :  The French representative here has to-day informed me that he has been instructed by his Government to present a note to the Lithuanian Government supporting the statement of the League of Nations recently made concerning the treatment of Polish political prisoners in this country, and also requesting that exiled Polish subjects may be allowed to return to their homes in Lithuania. His instructions are that he shall act in this matter in co-operation with the British representative at Kovno. He further informs me that the British and French Ministers at Warsaw are taking joint action in this matter with the Polish Government, and requesting more favourable treatment for Lithuanian citizens in the Vilna district and Poland.I replied, that I had not yet received instructions upon the matter. May I please be instructed as to what action I shall take ?In reply to the above the following message was sent to Mr. Dilley on 19th July : The Council of the League of Nations recommended on 17th May that the Polish and Lithuanian Governments should annul legal proceedings, in Lithuania and Poland and the territory in dispute, against all persons detained or expelled for political reasons. The Polish representative accepted the recommendation without reservations, and the Lithuanian expressed willingness to advise his Government, to accept it.   But neither will take the first step.Please join with your French and Italian colleagues, who have already received instructions, in making semi-official representations to the Lithuanian Government urging them to carry out the recommendation of the League as soon as possible.PERSIA.Anglo-American Oil Concessions [F.C.R., Ixxiii, p. 6]. In a message from Washington dated 11th July, Mr. Chilton, referring to the proposals passing between the Sinclair and the Standard Oil Companies, said that he had invited attention to the open-door principle, and that the question was being carefully considered by the State Department. Apparently the line of impartiality adopted by the Department was still being maintained, and the exclusive interest of the British in the southern concession was emphasized.Russo-Persian Relations [F.C.R., lxix, p. 4]. The return of M. Rothstein to Teheran was reported by Mr. Hodgson from Moscow on 17th July as being very unlikely. The failure of the Soviet policy in Persia was given as the reason of his recall. Mr. Hodgson also reported that no satisfactory progress was being made towards effecting a commercial treaty.Troops for Arabistan.&apos; Sir Percy Loraine reported on 19th July that information had reached him without any previous warning of the departure of some 500 Persian troops for Arabistan through the Bakhtiari country, without even the knowledge of the Khans, Sir Percy caused the serious view that he took of this step to be communicated to the Minister of War, pointing out the unrest that was likely to be caused, which would be inimical alike to British and Persian concerns, and the need of troops to preserve order elsewhere. The Minister of War declared his inability to stop the movement without the authority of the Prime Minister. Sir Percy, therefore, sent a similar communication to the latter, who was not so moderate in his attitude as the Minister of War, but in the end undertook to hold up the movement for two months.Telegraphing again on 22nd July Sir Percy Loraine reported as follows : The Prime Minister called yesterday about the question of troops for Arabistan. I told him that I thoroughly disliked the idea and wished him to abandon it. He said that the detachment was only 200, intended solely as the GovernoFs bodyguard, to remain at Shustar. Had he known I objected it would not have been despatched. I said that it was surprising that he should not have consulted me, and that the Minister of War was aware of my ideas when the question was raised some months ago. He said that the Government did not know on what pretext they could recall the detachment without being attacked in the Medjliss for yielding to foreign pressure, but both he and the Minister of War were ready to give most formal 42-4 . &apos;     B
POLAND.The Cabinet. -On 14th July Mr. Hoare reported, from Warsaw that after ah unsuccessful attempt to effect a &quot;compromise between the Right and Left parties the Chief of State had delegated his right of appointment to the Chief Commission of the Diet, who had entrusted M. Korfanty with the task of forming a new Cabinet. M. Korfanty had recently severed his connection with the National Democratic party.Two days later he further reported that the Chief of the State had informed the Diet that he would be compelled, in the near future, to resign his office as he could not co-operate with M. Koffanty, but did not wish to hinder his task of forming a Cabinet. M. Korfanty was proceeding with the formation of a Cabinet but the Chief of State&apos;s immediate resignation was considered unlikely.On 19th July he still further reported as follows :  . - M. Korfanty last night succeeded in forming a Cabinet, which included M. Skirmunt as Minister for Foreign Affairs and M. Michalski.. He submitted the list of Ministers this morning to the Chief of the State, who reiterated his former statement that he could not co-operate with him. M. Korfanty thereupon declared that he was fulfilling the task which had been entrusted to him by the nation and that he would leave the list of his Cabinet with the Chief of the State. The latter replied that he must consider the matter, but declined to state when he would take a. decision.RUSSIA.Hostile Attitude of Greece. -The foUowing message was sent from Moscow on 19th July by M. Karakhan, Acting-Commissary for Foreign Affairs : Au Ministre des. Affaires Etrangeres, London.Le gouvernement russe a appris avec etonnenient que des navires grecs montent la garde du littoral d&apos;Anatolie et realisent en fait un blocus.militaire. Ainsi nos navires soht arretes et les cargaisons, qu&apos;ils transportent a destination des ports turcs, sont confisquees. Le. fait du bombarclement de Samsoune par les Grecs-bomhardement dont le resultat a ete la destruction des depots de marchandises fusses qui s&apos;y trouvaient aprovoque chez le gouvernement russe un etonnementassurances to the Sheikh and to us, that the troops would not interfere either with the Sheikh&apos;s territory or the Arab tribes, arid would telegraph to the Sheikh accordingly. I replied that if the Sheikh agreed &apos; that might alter the case, but I could not recommend him to do so; - 1.1 ,.Sir Percy Loraine further reported that after consultation with two of the principal Khans it had been agreed that British interests Avere affected equally with those of the Khans and of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and that combined action on peaceful lines was necessary to ensure the :project being dropped. The Khans, agreed to instruct their heads of tribes by telegram to lodge an official protest with the Persian. Government; to communicate to the Sheikh the importance of combined action; and to ascertain by daily report from Ispahan through the Bakhtiari Governor-General the movements of the Persian troops.Sir Percy Loraine sent a further telegram on this matter on 24th July, which is as follows:-The Prime Minister, I now learn, represented to the Minister of War and the Cabinet that during the interview with myself reported in my telegram of 22nd July, he altogether overcame my objections to the despatch of the troops to Arabistan, and instructions have been sent to the troops to continue their march. His Highness&apos; language produced no such effect ou me, nor did I say anything which could conceivably be.interpreted in that sense. In an endeavour to clear the matter up, I had an interview with His Highness and the Minister of War this morning. The net result is that they, will not recall the troops nor suspend their progress ;&apos;but they give me assurances that neither the Sheikh nor his interests nor those of the Anglo-Persian Oil. Company would be interfered with or threatened in the slighest degree by these 200 troops of the, Acting-Governor&apos;s bodyguard. I have made it quite clear that my views had not changed, that the step was taken in spite of my insistent advice, and merely added that i should report the circumstances to you. I reproached His Highness keenly with his deplorable lack of frankness in this matter.
non moins grand. En attirant 1&apos;attention sur ces operations des navires grecs, le gouvernement de la Russie constate cpie&apos; le commandement naval allie a Constantinople, responsable pour le passage des bateaux a travers les Dardanelles, ne met aucun obstacle aux agissements cle la flotte grecque dans la mer noire, et cela au detriment de la cause de la paix en Proche Orient. Dans le memorandum rends a la delegation sovietiste a Genes les representants des gouvernements de 1&apos;Entente proposent an gouvernment de la Republique russe, aussi bien qu&apos;au gouvernement cVAngora, de contribner a Vetablissement de la paix en Asie Mineure. Profondement penetre de 1&apos;esprit pacifique, le gouvernement russe cherche sincerement la realisation de cette paix; par eontre les gouvernements de 1&apos;Entente, &quot;dont emane la proposition concernant le retablissement cle la paix en Asie Mineure, n&apos;empechent pas les Grecs de violer cette paix.au detriment, aussi bien de nos interets que des interets du gouvernement ami cVAngora. En exprimant sa protestation a ce sujet,le gouvernement de la Republique sovietiste russe attend des gouvernements de l&apos;Entente des mesures energiques pour faire cesser a ravenir cle pareils actes cVhostilite cle la part des Grecs actes dont la respousabilite incombe entierement aux gouvernements, qui a 1&apos;beure acttielle, controlent les Dardanelles et le Bosphore.SPAIN.Resignation of the Minister of War. On 17th July Mr. Houston-Boswall reported that General Olaguer, Minister of War, had resigned on the ground that be did not possess sufficient parliamentary ability. Senior Sanchez Guerra, President of the Council, had taken over the portfolio of Minister of War in addition to his other duties.TURKEY.The Angora Government and the Greeks. On 13th July the Foreign Office informed Mr. Henderson in Constantinople that M. Poincaire had stated, that the Angora Government had expressed officiaUy to Colonel Mongin their readiness to meet the Greeks in conference and to accept an armistice. The Foreign Office view was that if the Angora Government wished to proceed with this idea they should come into the open and   convey the intimation in a more official manner.Reported Resignation of the Angora Government.-On 14th July Mr. Henderson reported from Constantinople that telegrams from the Angora correspondents of (? group omitted) had announced the resignation of the Angora Government, on the adoption of a new law on the procedure for the election of Ministers by the Grand National Assembly, which was stated to have been presented for the sake of form in order to give the Assembly an opportunity of confirming or withdrawing the mandate given to Ministers under the old procedure. Mr. Henderson added that information regarding the exact nature of the new procedure was somewhat contradictory, but it certainly curtailed the power hitherto exercised by Mustapha Kemal. Nevertheless, the latest press telegram indicated that the principal members of the retiring Cabinet, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National Defence, had been re-elected.
