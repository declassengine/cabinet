Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,NftCAB//\/UP4.60 JConcentration of Shipping in the Atlantic.Proposals of Sir L. Chiozza Money and Report of Admiral Sir J. Jellicoe&apos;sCommittee.I circulate a note prepared by the Revenue Secretary, India Office. TheCommittee would not appear to have been sufficiently informed of thecharacter of the Indian export trade.A. C.22nd Mav 1917.Memorandum by the Revenue Secretary, India Office.The proposal put forward in this memorandum is not a new one, andthe policy of diverting, where possible, shipping to the North Atlantic runis already, I believe, being followed. A short time ago this, for exchangereasons, was discouraged, and the great spending Departments wereforbidden to place contracts in the United States of America where thiscould be avoided. But with the entry of the United States of America intothe war the position has altered, and now that the financial difficulties havebeen removed, the tendency must be to obtain from our new Ally increasingsupplies of war commodities. This has already led-and as time goes onwill lead to an increasing extent-to more ships being placed on the NorthAtlantic run, and the object of the memorandum is, as I understand it, tohasten this process. To that extent the proposal, from the Imperial pointof view, is wholly admirable, and no objection can be raised, on the score ofinjury likely to be caused to Indian interests. It seems doubtful, however,whether the diversion of shipping could be carried out to the extentcontemplated, even though the export trade of the United Kingdom andthe interests of the Dominions and India were sacrificed.The passages extracted on themargin1 indicate that the avar can becarried on almost entirely with theresources of North America. But thememorandum seems to over-state thoseresources, to under-state the extent towhich war commodities must continueto be brought from other parts of theworld, and to omit to take into accountthat our Allies, including the United States of America, must be suppliedwith many essential commodities. I have ventured to make a few pencilnotes on the memorandum to bring this out, but an examination of some ofthe more important Indian exports may be more convincing. I preface thisexamination by stating that, so far as exports from India to the UnitedKingdom are concerned, the shortage of freight and difficulties of financehave already combined to restrict exports to little more than war commodities.Trade, however, with other countries still continues, and I find from thelatest returns that, in the first eleven months of 1916-17, 396 British vesselsand 362 foreign vessels, aggregating If million tons, cleared from Indianports to foreign countries. The trade with foreign countries is largelyaccounted for by war commodities to the Allies, but a great deal of ordinarytrade is also carried onjin such commodities, for example, as jute, jute goods,cotton, oilseeds and rice.1 now examine to what extent Indian exports of the more important warcommodities would be affected by the proposal.22397  1 685  50-5/171 1. &quot;A comparatively trifling- amountof cargo brought from other sources.&quot;2. &quot; There are few things of importancewhich the United States lacks, the chiefbeing rubber and tin.&quot;3. &quot; All that is needed is to stop tradingwith the world and to conserve our shipsin keeping open communication with NorthAmerica.&quot;
Manganese Ore. In the first 11 months of 1916-17 India supplied to theUnited Kingdom and Allies 567,198 tons, and far from the United States ofAmerica being in a position to make good this supply, arrangements are atthe moment being made to increase the monthly shipments from India to theUnited States of America from 5.000 to 20,000 tons. Manganese ore is anessential commodity, and to maintain future supplies regular monthly ship-ments of something like 70,000 tons will have to be made. Further, seeingthat a ship cannot be entirely loaded with ore, something like 25 ships wouldbe required monthly for this purpose.Wheat. Arrangements have been made to carry 285,000 tons monthly inMay, June, and July 250,000 tons from Karachi and Bombay (almostentirely for France and Italy), and 35,000 tons from Calcutta for Greece.The ships used, I understand, are both allied and British. Apart altogetherfrom the fact that North America could probably not meet this demand, thejourney from India to Italy and Greece is, I believe, safer and shorter thanthat from America to these places, and this traffic, therefore, cannot bediverted to the North Atlantic.Similarly in regard to maize, barley, and gram supplied from India toMediterranean ports. I have not the latest figures, but the monthly ship-ments, I believe, are about 50,001) tons, and the journey is more economicalthan that from the Argentine or North America.Rice. 50,000 tons monthly are required in the United Kingdom. Thismust be brought from Burma.Shellac, mica, saltpetre. All these are essentials which must be broughtfrom India, and the United States of America relies very largely on thissource of supply.   The total tonnage involved is about 3,500 monthly.Wolfram. We know that the United Kingdom must have wolfram fromBurma. The tonnage, however, is comparatively small, and this year willprobably not exceed 400 tons a month.Tea. The Shipping Controller has provided liner freight for the carriageof at least 8,200 tons a month from India and Ceylon, 2,156 for the troopsand the balance for the civil population. More will probably be carried,and, from a statement I have just received in connection with tonnagepriority work, I see that the Food Controller has asked for 10,000 tons inJuly. He has apparently decided that the civil population of the countrymust have their tea, and so long as this decision holds it will be necessaryto import something like 10,000 tons of tea monthly from India andCeylon.Hides, raw and tanned. Arrangements have been made for the purchaseof the whole surplus production of Indian cowhides, raw and tanned, forHis Majesty&apos;s and the Italian Governments. Supplies cannot be obtainedelsewhere, and the United States of America, as a matter of fact, has alwaysbeen a very large purchaser of Indian hides. These sup2jlies must continueto be obtained from India.   About 3,000 tons monthly are involved.Connected with this is tanning substances, and for myrabolams theUnited Kingdom relies on India (3 4,000 tons monthly).Wool.-Ii the-War Office can do without East Indian wool India wouldlose her market. The quantity involved is about 50,000,0(J0 lbs., worthabout 2,50(),000Z. But as East Indian wool is especially useful for armyblankets, it seems very doubtful whether this country can do without it.Jute and Jute Goods. The raw jute required by the War Office willstill have to be carried. So also must sandbags for the allied armies,,and the Shipping Controller is providing monthly 10,500 tons of freightfor sandbags alone. But over and above these military requirements itmust be remembered that the crops of the world cannot be moved ifjute-the brown paper of the wholesale trade cannot be supplied. Thereis a limit to the extent to which jute can be replaced by cotton, and allcountries, European and American, must obtain supplies if the trade of theworld is to continue.   The trade is a large one, and including wrar bags the
total shipments of raw jute and jute goods from India in the first 11 monthsof 1916-17 were :-Raw jute       - - - 494,187 tons.Bags      - - -      765,000,000.  Cloth - &quot; &quot;    1,133,000,000 yards.Oils and Oilseeds. It is for the Ministry of Munitions and the Controllerof Oil Supplies to say whether we can live on stocks for the next fewmonths, and if so, it might be possible to suspend shipments for a shorttime. Personally I doubt whether the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates of America, even with the fullest co-operation, could carry on verylong without the oleaginous produce of the tropics. India and WestAfrica are the main sources of supply and India now exports to alldestinations at the rate of about 1,000,000 tons annually. If it weredecided to live on stocks for a few months, Indian exports would undoubtedlydecrease, but in practice it would probably be found necessary to combineoilseeds with manganese ore to make up a ship&apos;s cargo.Goal. India has only been able to meet the heavy demands recentlythrown on her for bunkers at the expense of her industries and railways.The diversion to any considerable amount of shipping from Eastern watersto the North Atlantic would lessen this strain and would therefore be somuch to the good.From this rough examination it is sufficiently clear that even if thefullest possible effect were given to the policy advocated in the memoraudumthe export trade from India to this country would, with the possibleexception of wool and oilseeds, not be seriously disturbed. Further, theexport of Avar commodities to the Allies would still continue. As forprivate trade with foreign countries, this, so far as foreigD ships areemployed, would continue, but a certain number of British ships plyingbetween India and other countries might possibly be diverted at theexpense of India&apos;s export trade. Running down the list of the 396 Britishships which cleared for foreign ports in the first eleven months of the pastyear, I find that 10 cleared for Russia (probably carrying sandbags), 74 forFrance (largely, I imagine, carrying war commodities), 11 for Italy (ditto),114 for Asiatic Turkey, Arabia and Persia (mainly, I should say, on militarywork), 19 for Java, 15 for China, 46 for Japan, and 62 for the United Statesof America. In addition a number of British ships are employed in voyagesbetween India and the Colonies mainlv Cevlon. the Straits Settlements andAustralia.This branch of India&apos;s export trade would probably suffer if British shipsnot employed in the carriage of commodities of direct national importancewere diverted to the North Atlantic. But the list I have enumerated relatesto the period ending February 1917, and it is understood that the processof diverting ships has already begun. After all, if British ships in militaryemploy and those carrying war commodities to the Allies be excluded thereis no great margin to work upon.The restriction of trade would ease the difficulty of financing exports butwould lead to the serious results described in a recent telegram receivedfrom the Viceroy. These would have to be faced, but it is satisfactory tolearn that it is contemplated in the memorandum and by Sir John Jellicoe&apos;sCommittee that financial compensation would be made. If this recom-mendation be accepted by the War Cabinet the preparation of a claim wouldnot be easy.One question, which can only be decided by the Admiralty, emergesfrom the above. If only partial effect can be given to the policy of concen-trating shipping in the North Atlantic, and if, as seems certain, largequantities of war commodities will still have to be brought from India (andpossibly also from other parts of the world) it follows that the trade routeswill still have to be kept open and guarded. It is for the Admiralty to saywhether it is appreciably less troublesome to guard a trade route used by50 ships a month than the same route used by, say, 30.L. J. K.India Office,22nd May 1917.
