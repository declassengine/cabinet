Prom Brigadier-GeneralJ^ox.To1114.D.M.I.Petrograd  -20th May 1917. ^ - - -KALEDIN has beerT^TppCTnted to the 5th Army in theplace of DANILOV.     As the latter did not agree with the newCommander-in-Chief of the Northern front ABRAM DRAGOMIROV itwas necessary to replace him.The 5th Army was offered to KORNILOV who refusedasking for a command further from Petrograd, so KALEDIN wastransferred as he has commanded the 8th Army for a year withconspicuous success.     P0L0VTS0V has been appointed Comraander-in-Chief of the Petrograd military district but he has not yetarrived from the front.Today KERENSKY has commenced visiting units in theirbarracks.     The effect of these visits will   last a few hourslonger than those of KORNILOV as the former is a practicalspeaker.     Without bloodshed,however I am convinced permanentorder will not be restored.     No attempt is being made to closedown the Pravda although it daily attacks the Allies.N.C.0&apos;s have been elected by the Depot battalion of theMoscow Regiment of the Guards here to command its companiesand ensigns joining from Military schools are placed undertheir orders.     This state of affairs has continued for over2 months.     In the LITOVSKI Depot battalion 2 officers arestill under arrest.       TERESHCHENKO said that deserters willbe punished by penal servitude.     He knows that the railwayscould not carry half the deserters back to their units intime (before May 28th) even if the orders were taken seriouslyand this will no   doubt be the loophole for a further amnesty.
