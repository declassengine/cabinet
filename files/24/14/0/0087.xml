From Viceroy, 29th May 1917.(Received at India Office, 3 p.m.)Secret. MahsudJ Your telegram of the-23rd instant.- in view of seriousdifficulties arising from persistent floods in Gomal it has been decided tomodify plan of operations. After full discussion of all military and politicalconsiderations, Commander-in -Chief has approved proposal to operate by theJandola Haideri Kach Barwand line to Khaisara instead of via Gomal. Atthe same time a force will be maintained at Sarwekai of sufficient strengthand mobility to menace rear of an enemy opposing advance by Jandola line.We consider risk of extension of trouble is likely to be lessened byretaliatory measures.   Following are replies to your questions : -(1) We do not think it is possible to secure permanent satisfactory settle-men t with Mahsuds without operations on an extended scale andoccupation of Mahsud country for at least 18 months, if notpermanently, and this is not desirable at present. We do not,therefore, contemplate proposing any formal terms of peace butmust trust to deterrent of sharp retaliation to secure modus vivendiuntil we can conveniently deal with MahsudS- conclusively.Retaliation will dispel prevailing opinion that we are bound topassive defence and may deter Mahsuds from serious acts ofaggression for some time to come. Much, however, must dependon success of operations, and we must keep a free hand to dealwith tribes as may seem most suitable, and cannot now definitelyformulate our intentions.(2) If operations in Khaisara fail to have required effect, we shallprobably undertake further retaliatory measures based on the:  then existing situation. -c&quot;&apos;(3)&apos; In correspondence with Amir I have always made it clear that tribesmay force .us into active operations. 11 propose shortly to write tohim explaining4the necessity for the movement from Jandola.(4) No special measures are at present necessary as regards the Afridis,but situation is being carefully watched, Garrisons on Peshawarborder remain intact.
