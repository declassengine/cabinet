SICE Elit aWAR CABINETPROPOSED MINISTRY OP HEALTH(Memorandum by Lord Mliner)The question of tho establishment of a Ministry of Healthoriginally raised by Lord Rhondda was referred by the WarCabinet on April 6th. to Mr.Henderson and myself in consulta-tion with Lord Rhondda, Sir iidwin Cornwall, Dr.Addison, Dr0Pisher,Mr.Barnes and Mr.Montagu, with Mr.G.M.Young acting as secretary.This Committee reported to the Cabinet fin April 21st. tothe effect that the question should be referred to the Recon-struotion Committee who should be asked to appoint a Sub-Committeeto consider the best means of establishing tho Ministry of Healthwith the least dolay.This Sub-Committee reported (see Appendix A.) in favourof the transference of the work of the National Health Insuranceto the Local Government   Board, which should be divided intotwo parts - one Branch to be devoted entirely to Health, one tothe other functions of the Local Government Board.The Sub-Committee was unanimous but Sir iSdwin Cornwallput in a memorandum of protest (see Appendix B.).     Beforefinally deciding tho question, Mr.Henderson and I had decided tosee the representatives of the Joint Committee of ApprovedSocieties, and to-morrow had been fixed as tho day for seeingthem.     In the interval, Mr.Henderson has left, and the Societieshave written to say they cannot ccma and are   waiting to seethe prime Minister whom they had previously approached.Before Mr.Henderson left, he expressed his readiness toconcur in any recommendation I might give to the Cabinet on thesubject.    We had as a matter of fact talked it over together andafter having given full considoration to Sir JSdwin Cornwall1sobjections wo had both come to tho conqulljsion that unless therepresentatives of tho Approved Societies v/ere able to put awholly new aspect on the question, the recommendations of thoSub-Committee should be accepted in their entirety.As the Approved Societies are evidently not disoosed tosee anyone but the Prime Minister I can do nothing further in thematter.    Personally I do not think they are entitled to takethis lino and that it is merely a piece of obstructive tactics.If the matter rested with mo I should go ahead without them.     Butin view of their appeal to the Prime Minister I can only reportthe position of affairs to the Cabinet.I will only add that, If the Cabinet decides not to adoptthe recommendations of the Sub-Committee without further enquiryand negotiations I hope that the future conduct of this affairmay be entrusted to some other Minister - not necessarily amember of the Cabinet.     I am dealing at present with a numberof very difficult and pressing matters - Food, Liquor, theAgricultural Programme, Priority of Shipping, etc., etc, andthis question, however important, is not of the same urgency.The fact that Mr.Young, who had all tho details of thisbusiness at his finger!s ends, has gone away with Mr.Henderson,makes it additionally difficult for me to deal with it withoutdetriment to the other matters delegated to me by the Cabinet.24th May,1917(Sgd.)
