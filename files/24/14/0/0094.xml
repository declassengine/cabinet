This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1917.SECRET........-________-c^-r-Vt-VNAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION, 1.Introductory Remarks.THE Navy&apos;s part in the present war may be conveniently divided into offensiveand defensive operations. The former aim aft bringing pressure to bear on the enemypeople, so as to cause a desire for peace and-thus compel him to come to terms. Withthis end in view, our offensive strategy finally aims at one or both of the followingobjects:-(a.) Theprotection of the sea communications *of the British and Allied armies,more particularly; in France, where our main offensive lies.(b.) Prevention of enemy trade in order to handicap his military operations andbring pressure to bear oh the mass of his people.Defensive operations include-(a.) The protection of British and Allied trade.(&amp;.) Resistance to invasion and raids.These four objects can only be completely and permanently attained by defeatingthe enemy&apos;s main fleet and destroying his fighting ships, and therefore offensive actionagainst his fighting ships serves the end of both our offensive and defensive strategy.- j       The success of the German submarine attack;, which is an offensive operation ofI the first magnitude, partly depends on the latent power of the German High Sea Fleet.J Not only does the latter immobilise a large number of destroyers, &amp;c, from the directI protection of trade, but it makes attack on the enemy submarines in close vicinity toI the enemy ports, an extraordinarily difficult operation.   For this reason, the GermanHigh Sea Fleet will tend to adopt a strictly defensive attitude during the present phaseof the war.   It may come out, but it will probably avoid action.The general reply to the enemy plans is : the concentration of our efforts oncontrolling our own and the enemy&apos;s communications, so as to resist the pressureapplied by him, and to drag out his fighting ships.   The Grand Fleet has of course tobe kept concentrated and ready for battle, but we partly defeat the immobilising powerof the German Fleet by employing the destroyers, submarines, &amp;c, attached to theGrand Fleet for battle purposes, in patrolling the northern exit of the North Sea, so faras is consistent with maintaining superiority of force in the decisive area.   If the enemyl finds that his submarine campaign begins to flag, he may endeavour to pass a largeI number of fast armed raiders into.the Atlantic, and unless the northern area is closelyI patrolled, that should not be a very difficult operation.Comment on Current Operations.During the past week the transport of troops and munitions across the Channelhas continued without serious interruption, but if the submarine attack continues atits present intensity, it will, as timegoes on, react more and more seriously on militaryoperations oversea.The fact that nine British ships have been sunk in the Mediterranean during the&apos; week ending the 27th May, is a warning to limit as far as possible the scope and extentof oversea expeditions, except in these cases where geographical or other factorsfacilitate the protection of their communications.As the other great offensive operation, the prevention :of German trade, whether inenemy or neutral ships, or whether through enemy or neutral ports, is carried out by[649-1] B
other than naval methods, it can hardly be included in&quot; a naval appreciation ; but ,tliefundamental fact remains, that it is the only purely naval means of applying pressure-to the enemy people.   Also as a means of dragging out the enemy fighting ships, it i&amp;one of the principal causal factorsdn bringing about sea battles.With regard to defensive operations the following table,* by comparing the tonnageentered and cleared with the tonnage sunk whilst carrying cargoes to or from theUnited Kingdom, is a true indication of the intensity of the submarine attack ontrade y Comparison of the Tonnage of Vessels Arriving at or Sailing from the UnitedKingdom with the Amount of Tonnage Lost by Submarines and Mines..

During, the; very heavy\-losses in April,&apos;five-sixths of the ships sank were.homeward bound.  This phenomenon .Iis apparently.due to the greater control. exercised Dver the outward trade, and if the. same degree of control could be exercised, over the homeward trade, decreased sinkings,&apos;,would certainly result. , ., The &quot;Hilary.,&apos;-&apos; one of the armed merchant cruisers of the 10th.Cruiser Squadron,was sunk on the 25th May by.a submarine between the Faroe and Shetland Islands.In addition to the submarine attack, two armed raiders are believed to.be at large.-When last heard of one was operating on the terminal area of the South-East Americantrade, and the.other, after operating in the Indian Ocean, has disappeared. -The number of submarines which it is estimated have been operating in thedifferent areas are shown on the attached chart. They have been most active in theMediterranean; and,to the west of the British Isles,. There is also! a recrudescence ofactivity, in the Bay of Biscay.&apos; Minelaying by the u U.C.,&quot;- type of boat, which had shown a temporary lull, appearsto.be recommencing, the area affected being between Dover and Cromer. :The Scandinavian convoy is working, smoothly, and, the first ocean convoy, ofsixteen ships from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom arrived safely on the 20th May,whilst the second, from the U.S.A. to the United Kingdom, consisting of twelvevessels under escort of H.M.S. &quot; Roxburgh,&quot; sailed on the 24th May.The institution of these convoys is a matter of interest, for it is a departure from! the system that has hitherto been in force. Cruisers or specially armed merchantmenI form the escort across the open sea, and they are relieved by destroyers on reachingI the, areas where submarines are likely to be operating,. ^The convoy. from,, Gibraltar, appears to have worked very well, and the time ofpassage was less.than, if .they had been dispersed on the usual routes.The success of the convoy system will of course chiefly depend on the Avay it isorganised and directed. A convoy- steaming in a large number of small columns hasless chance of meeting submarines than a similar,number of dispersed ships, but, if. asubmarine does meet them, the- losse,s will probably be greater. This danger.may,however, be partly discounted by a sufficiency of -fast and. active; escpr.tvessels, and bydeflecting the convoys from areas in which submarines have been sighted.       \* Complete figures not available on going to press, but it is hoped to obtain them in the future
^The following table shows the number of ships sunk by submarines and mines- during each of the last three weeks, and the average weekly sinkings for April: *	British Ships.

The fine weather has probably facilitated the work of our patrol vessels, andthe increased number of destroyers, based on the South of Ireland, has probably helpedto keep the enemy under water. On the other hand, it may be-due to other causes,such as sending a number of submarines to some special area, such as the Northernpatrol where the &quot; Hilary &quot; was sunk. This would be a very likely move on the partof the enemy preparatory to passing raiders out on the Atlantic trade routes.The recently instituted seaplane patrols are working well, especially those in thevicinity of the North Hinder Lightship, which is approximately midway betweenHarwich and the Dutch coast. In twenty-seven flying days between the 13th Aprilj and the 20th May this patrol from Felixstowe sighted tnirteen hostile submarines andI bombed seven. It is possible that this may be the cause of the marked decrease ofI minelaying in the Harwich area.This method of working seaplanes in conjunction with surface craft is undoubtedlyan efficient one for protecting the trade in certain focal and terminal areas.During the week, twenty-one encounters with submarines have been reported. Inthe vast majority of cases this simply means that the submarines were driven belowthe surface. The difficulty of hitting a submarine by gunfire is notorious, except atvery short range on the surface.The report of the bombardment of Zeebrugge carried1 out by certain monitors ofthe Dover Patrol on the 12th May has been received. It is interesting as illustrating amore direct form of trade protection, namely, offensive operations against an enemybase.The object of the bombardment was the destruction of the lock gates betweenZeebrugge and Bruges, so that by making the canal tidal, enemy destroyers would beprevented from lying at Bruges except at high tide. The target occupied an area ofabout 90 by 30 feet, and as firing was carried out at 26,000 yards and was entirelydependent on aircraft for correcting the fall of shot, the difficulty of hitting was verygreat indeed. An effectual smoke screen was interposed between the flotilla and thetarget, and it is doubtful whether the enemy were even able to open fire. The Vice-Admiral in charge of the operations believes that he achieved his object, but it isdifficult to form a reliable opinion as to the actual results without reports from eye-witnesses.   The photograph does not show any signs of damage to the lock gates.[649-1]

The Germans are convoying,, their-steamers across the Baltic ffom theStockholm Archipelago south, and it is stated that they have relaid their minefieldnorth of Gottska Sando, which protects this trade route.The passage of British steamers from the Baltic has commenced, and the firstseven have reached Christiania safely. Their voyage apparently caused a concentrationof German submarines and armed trawlers off Kogrund.The Gulfs of Finland, Bothnia, and Riga are now ice-free.   Traffic across the Gulfof Bothnia has been temporarily suspended on account of the presence of German sub- -marines.Turkey.A report from Mytilene, dated &apos;25th May, states that Admiral Souchon anct, staff :were recently at Smyrna with the object of preparing it as a submarine base; also thatthere was unusual,naval activity at Constantinople.   &quot; Goeben &quot; has been reported tobe capable of steaming her former speed.G
