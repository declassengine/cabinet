3B0 RE iG.T.895     . Oopy Ho.TO, QABIBBE.Memorandum by the   Skipping Oontroiler *The Shipping   Controllor has been considering the positionof tank&quot;tonnage building.in this country.    At present there areonly trconty tank steamers suitable for Overseas work under con-struction hore*     The. last of these will be completed in December*end no prevision is being msde for further construction.     It isnecessary, therefore, fcr a policy to be laid down similar to thatwhich was laid down for the building of Standard cargo ships.These may be divided Into;-(a)   Kavy ffool.foJ   Army petrol for France.(oj   Oommerical requirements.(a) M.vT        :The position of the   lavy Fuel reserve 16 very serious.Tho approved stock is six months1 consumption    1,350,000 tons,-,the actual amount in stock on the 1st May was 747,000. tons, i*e.three months1 stock.     It is calculated that If we lose tank.&quot;steamers on the same basis as in April there will be only 620,000tons in the country in November, 1917, and1 in February 1910 about.1 montiis1 supply,(b) AKMX SPIRIT:Up to January it was sufficient to employ two tank steamerson this service,,   It Is novc^nly possible to maintain the approvedreserve by tho uso of six steamers,Co) COMMBRIOAI/: ^The stocks of all commerical oils, viz., petrol, kerosene,and gas.oil, are now in a serious condition.   . On the 1st Maythere was about 60,000 tons of spirit in this country - sufficientfor six weeks1 supply.      Owing however to the loss of tanksteamers and increased consumption by the British Army, it has beenfound necessary to send 17,000 tons to $ranee., and In addition theWar Office desire to accumulate a reserve of .20,000 tons in thiscountry.    The ire suit of these measures has been to r educe thestock of spirit In this country to -about &quot;1 month.     The stocks ofkerosene and- gas oil are about one month.A38IS3AH0E FROM u&quot;.g.A,In order to bring up the reserves to a more reasonable level,assistance in tank steamers was asked for from the U,S.,A. at variousdates between 23rd April and 6th May on the following basis
(a) Navy fuel, steamers to carry ... ... 100,000 tons.

(b) Army spirit, Steamers to carry ... ... 18,000 tons.

(c) Commercial, Steamers to carry ... ... 60,000 tons.

A total of ... 178,000 tons.

Unfortunately the U.S.A. Government have not the power to requisition, while the tank steamers under the American Flag belong largely to the various Large Oil Companies, who employ them in their own business and are not anxious to allocate them for the dangerous voyage to U.K.

We have therefore only received offers from the American Government of three steamers for ? loading. The Shipping Controller has sent two representatives to the United States of America, who are in possession of all details, and it is hoped that when the Congress passes the Requisition ?, we shall be able to obtain assistance on a larger scale.

Purchase of American Steamers has also been suspended at present following cabled advice by Mr. Balfour.

Even if the assistance were at once forthcoming the position would be as follows:-

NAVY

(a) ON BASIS OF 4 MONTHS RESERVE

Want 250,000 tons more.

U.S.A., asked for 100.000 tons of shipping.

This would take 5 months to make up.

(b)ON BASIS OF 6 MONTHS RESERVE

Want 750,000 tons more.

U.S.A, asked for 100,000 tons of shipping.

This would take 15 months to make up.

COMMERCIAL

(a) ON BASIS OF 2 MONTHS RESERVE

Need 150,000 tons more.

U.S.A. asked for 60,000 tons.

Would take 4 months to make up.

(b) ON BASIS OF 3 MONTHS RESERVE

Want 270,000 tons.

Would take 8 months to make up.

(No loss allowance at all).

It is obvious from the above that it will be a long time before we are able to get up our stocks again to the proper reserve, and meanwhile wo have to face the possibility of serious losses which can only be made up by building.
.1;   \417BUILSI5G.The Shipping Controller has received the following letterfrom the-Admiralty s-^gGth April, 1917VI am commanded &quot;by My Lords Commissioners of the AdmiraltyIJto inform you&apos;thatr in view of the recent heavy losses of Oilntank steamers, approval has been obtained from tho Lords^Commissioners of H*M, Treasury to lay down in this country six^additional oversea Oilers as soon as six slips at present&quot;occupied by six trade Oilers are vacated*&quot;2.   In addition to. tho above, it will also be nocossary*t.o lay down the following Fleet Attendance Oilers during the&quot;next six months as slips become vacantWS;000 tons     ....    ...     3 Bo.nl,000 tons......     6 n     &quot;As regards the latter part? viz,, the construction of tanksteamers for Fleet Attendance, the Shipping Controller only wishesto observe that it is presumed this construction will bo carriedout as pert of the ordinary Admiralty Building Programme0With regard&quot;however to the construction of tank steamersfor Overseas work, it is considered that provision must at oncebe made for the present situation, and for possible futuredifficulties, on a system which will give prompt relief withoutdefinitely committing us to diminutions of our Gargo SteamerProgramme, which may turn out later to have boon unnecessary *The ordinary tank steamers, constructed to carry all sortsof petroleum products, including light petrol of very low flash,cannot be used tn &quot;kn^thihg but OileIf therefore v/e embark on a large building programme ofsuch steamers and later our demand for oil fuel and our loesosby enemy operations become smaller, we shall have on our handsa large number of steamers not available for the carriage offoo d, Emnit ions 9 etcAt tho same time the Shipping   Controller is convinced thata large number of Tank Steamers must be provided at once,, anddefinite provision must bo made for losses in the future and&apos; the prevision in his opinion can be made in the following mannerDuring last year, when the shortage of general cargo steamerswas not so severely felt, stops were taken to convert elevencargo steamers for the carriage of ITavy Mel oil..   It was foundthat this could be done in two to four months, and in such amanner that it did not unfit the steamer for tho carriage of manysorts of cargo, or in any case for reconversion at a small outlayfor such carriage8- &quot;The reason for this is that heavy oil is. above 1750 flashpointy so that it is not necessary to take such precautions toprevent its percolation to dangerous parts of tho ship.such asthe engine room, boiler room, and shaft tunnel *.Pursuing this idea it is considered to be quite possibleto convert the larger size standard ships for the conveyance ofITavy Fuel, without appreciably lengthening the time taken forbuilding.Not only that:   It Is found that by making certain smallalterations in the early stages of construction it is possible ajok
&apos;ll418to provide for the building without deciding whether they are tobe Tank ,Steamers or Cargo Steamers until within two months ofthe date of thoir&apos;delivery *The advantages of this policy nay be summarised as fellows:-,,-&quot;&apos;   :  1-. Completion in eight months as against twelve monthsfor the tank steamer capable of carrying light oils6Zc If a small espouse bo incurred in an early stage of thobuilding of the steamer, she can be converted Into a IfevyFuel boat within wo months of compile tion 0c&apos;3* Tho Steamer can at any time either&apos; now or after theWar bo reconverted.into a cargo boa.to.  4* The Standard type is retained with all its advantagesB5. Tho Steamer will be In appearance tho same as a Standardship,. Instead of betraying by Its appearance that it isan oil carriers.The Shipping Controller therefore wishes to urge strongly.. that.Adofinite policy be adopted of building convertible standardships,: and not the ordinary oil tanker of commerce,.It would of course be an essential pert of the scheme-that as.steamers were required for the conveyance of petrol orkerosene,- such steamers of which tho Admiralty has C. large number .on requisition should bo released for trade purposes, and theirplaces taken by converted &quot;standard shipse . Should this scheme beapproved by the War Cabinet the Shipping Controller&apos;would bo gladto receive a definite pledge that this will, be done, the convertedships being.allocated by him against the various requirements inthe usual manner-, subject to War Cabinet authority.As- regard the number to be so converted&apos;the Shipping Controller-has carefully considered the present position, and has of .coursefully appreciated the requirements for tonnage for general cargo-purposes 0It is his opinion that steps should at onco be taken toconvert 33lM?Mf standard ships for the earliest possible readiness,but the whole of the eighteen to be completed not later thanHovoniberThis would provide replaces for estimated losses ofthree ships per month from to-day0     In addition he purposes thattwelve, of the cargo ships now being&apos; built in tho UoSoA,. and Japanshould ha. completed on similar linos, and he has already taken thisin hand.;    This should enable us to cope with even greater losses-Finally ? it is proposed that out of the&apos; -standard ships laiadown in this country each month from now, sis should hare thenecessary preliminary, work placed in- them waioh will enable us toconvert them, if required at a la tor date.The Shipping Controller understands that the approved reserveof Havy Fuel in this, country Is sis months- consumption, a figurewhich was arrived at when the TJ,S eA. wore neutral or expected to be so,He ventures to suggest that in view of the extreme shortage of&quot;oil and spirit for commercial purposes, and the necessity of bus-banding our building resources in every possible way no action shouldbe taken t&amp; increase Admiralty stocks above four months- supply until-commercial stocks amount to two month5s consumption on tlie mosteconomical possible basis - due allowance for possible losses beingmade-*     When the stocks have reached this level the question ofraising&apos;them further relativelyt o bo further considered by the WarOabinofco
