This was brought to the notice of theMinister of Munitions in a letter.from the War Office dated4th July, 1916.In reply to an enquiry from the War Office, the Commander-in-Chief in Prance stated in a letter dated 1.3th July, 1916-,that he was anxious to obtain extra range by means of modifyingthe heads of both shrapnel and H.E. shell.On the 19th July, 1916 the. Army Council requested theMinistry of Munitions to provide. H.E.. shell for heavy guns struckWith such a radius as would; give the longest range possible, andSimilarly that shrapnel shell with, heads struck with a suitable,radius,., should also be provided for heavy; guns.. On the 31st July, 1916 the Minister of Munitions, statedthat designs of 4 calibre headed shell had been approved for the12 inch, 9.2 inch and 6 inch guns, and that a 3 c,r.h. designhad been approved for the 60 pdr.On the 16th August, 1916 the Commander-in-Chief asked thatsteps be gradually taken to introduce shells of such calibreradius heads as would give the greatest possible range combinedwith accuracy for the 60 pdr., 6 inch, 9.2 inch and 12 inch guns.This request was forwarded to the Minister of Munitions on the30th August, 1916,  ;;.&apos;-MayJuneJulyAugust260328407 .447
-2-On the 18th September, 1916, a further letter was,received from the CdmmanderHLn-Chie f la France, pointing outthe paramount importance of increasing the range of guns andhowitzers of the British Armies in, France as much as possible,and urging that fullest advantage be taken of the Frenchexperiments which had recently been carried out with a view tointroducing false heads for their shell.     his request wasbrought to the notice of the Minister of Munitions on the 25thSeptember, 1916.Ofc the 1st October, 1916, a letter was received fromthe Ministry of Monitions indicating the estimated increasein range if false caps of 8 calibre radius head were fittedto the shell of the following guns,,4.7&quot;, 60 pdr., 6&quot; Mark VII,9,2 inch Mark VI, and X, and the 12n Mark IX.It was at the same time pointed out that it seemed theincrease in range, when using these caps with the low velocity-howitzers, v/ould be so small that it did not seem advisableto interfere with output by introducing a new design.     Itwas, however-t thought that with the new higher velocity 8 inch,9.2 inch and 12 inch howitzers, the effect of the more pointedheads might be greater, and trials would be carried out toascertain this.On January 2nd, 1917, the Commander-in-Chief in Franceasked whether a design of shell with increased radius headhad yet been approved for the 60 pdr* gun, and when supply ofsuch shell might be expected.     He again pointed out thegreat importance he attached to the provision of these naturesof shell.The above letter was forwarded to the Minister of Munitionson the 10th January,1917, pointing out that in spite of thenumerous letters recording the importance of obtaining increasedrange which had been forwarded to the Minister, it was not until19th December, 1916, that the Ordnance Committee were asked toget out a design of the 8 Otr.hu shell for the 60 pdr* equipment.On the 1st February, 1917, information was received that $hetrials of the 8 c.r.h. shell of the 60 pdr. had given indifferentresults as regards accuracy, and that the manufacture of theseshell could not be recommended.On the   7th February, 1917, The Director of Artilleryinformed the Director General of Munitions Design that, in spiteof the unsatisfactory nature of the trials mentioned above, itwas still hoped that by further consideration of the subject, asatisfactory design of the 60 pdr. shell might be obtained.On the 18th February, 1917, an intimation was receivedfrom the D.G.M.D. that a further trial of another design ofshell had been ordered.On the 1st May, 191,7, information was received that a newdesign of 60 pdr. 8 c.r.h, H.K. and shrapnel shells had beenapproved.     3?he results of the trials with these as regardsaccuracy and increased range (11,000 yards) had proved quitesatisfactory.On the 7th May, 1917. the Army Council drew the attentionof the Minister to this approval and urged him in view of the longdelay in providing these shell, that no effort should be sparedto expedite their provision.WAR OFFICE25th May, 1917(Sgd.)
