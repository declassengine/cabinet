In the 1,780 cases ofthese cases dealt with up to date, 358 pensions and 1,422 gratuitieshave been granted.The numbers of claims now corning up for first award hasbeen considerably Increasing of late, partly owing to transfersmainly of Class W men to Class P of the Reserve, while the processof awarding has, for various reasons, slowed down so that thereare now 5,000 cases awaiting award.     The reorganisation to meetthis state of affairs referred to in last week!s report is totake effect from the 29th instant, when additional accommodationat Chelsea becomes available, and arrangements are being madeconsiderably to increase the staff actually making first awards.2.The work of awarding and authorising payment of widowsand dependants1 pensions in current cases is completely up to date.The rate of progress in the reassessment of dependants1Pensions is still rising, 2,983 having been disposed of in theweek against 2,440 in the previous week (Appendix I).

A statement of the proceedings of the Statutory Committeefor the week ending the 23rd May is annexed as Appendix III.The Inspectors1 reports on the work of Local Committeesshow that an increasing number of these are prising to theirlarger responsibilities and that the importance of the registerof disabled men on the corract keeping of whioh the propercare of the men must depend, is generally being recognised.Very favourable reports have been received of the Committees atOldham, Keighley, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lincoln and Swansea &amp; of thsIslington

APPENDIX III.WAR PENSIONS, &amp;c., STATUTORY COMMITTEE.REPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER.For week ended 23rd Slay, 1917.ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from Re-ports of   Inspectors of Accounts.Our Inspector reporting on the   Cldham Local Committeestates with reference to discharged men that the compilation ofthe Register has been well taken in hand and that since thebeginning of April every notified case has been visited.     Thereare some 600 cases and all particulars have been obtained.    Muchtrouble is taken to find work for these men and there is now verylittle being paid under Regulation 11 and 12 compared with thelarger amount durjlng the December   Quarter.Reporting on Keighley Local Committee, our Inspectorstates that he is of opinion that this   Committee is doing itswork very well.&apos;   Rent Allowance cases are kept strictly withinthe Regulations.     Oases of advances are being closely watchedand recoveries during the last   quarter have come in well.As regards disabled men.      The Register is nearlycomplete&apos;and contains 234 names.     Training generally has not been;necessary, but in a few oases training is being given fres sag-no grant is being paid.Reporting on Ashton-under-Lyne Local Committee, ourInspector states that he examined the records of two of thelargest Wards and found the payments to be in order.    Further,that apart from payments, more than the usual amount of workis done by the local Committee to assist soldiers1 dependantsby correspondence, while no effort is spared to obtain employmentfor disabled men.     The Accounts are well kept and all detailsare available.Reporting on   Lincoln Local Committee, our Inspectorstates that there are 300 cases of disabled men on the Registerof this Local Committee to date.      The accounta are excellentlykept and the case work is careful.Our Inspector reporting on the Stirlingshire loealCommittee states that he has now called on all the surroundingStirlingshire District Committees which took the place of thaFalkirk District Committee.      The officials in these severalDistrict Committees took up their duties on the 1st April.     Thetwo largest are Grangemouth and   falkirk.     The work inStirlingshire, he thinks, will now get along all right, but itis a pity that the District Ccmmitteesdid not receive a littlemore assistance and guidance from the   Local Committee.Reporting on Mountain  Ash, our   inspector states thatthe population in this area is from 42 to 45,000.     The impressiongained was that the Sub-Committees generally are composed entirelyof miners and that miners are of all persons the least qualified
/w 3 oto administer publio monies.Reporting on Swansea   Local   Committee, tlie same Inspectorstates that disabled men are dealt with as they call at the OfficeThe great majority of the discharged disabled men are at work anddoing well.   Several are being specially medically treated andmany are receiving attention from their Club or   Panel Doctors.There is in this Office an excellent base from which the work fordisabled men will be conducted.     Before the official Registerwas issued&quot; there was a complete Register of all men notified asdischarged.    The Statutory Committee Register is entered up todate and now contains 720 names.The same Inspector reporting on  Barry Local Committee&apos;Glamorganshire, states that rents in this District are very high,none less that 6/- while many reach 12/- a week.     There isregular home visiting and lady almoners take grants to the homesof the wives and dependants.      All discharged men notified havebeen written to and are urged&apos;to call at the   Office.    As theresponse was not satisfactory, members of the Committee decidedto visit the men who lived near.       Practically all of them areat work and they will all be kept under sympathetic supervision.Reporting on Caerphilly Local Committee, the cameInspector states that the enlistments from Caerphilly are fargreater than was general in South Y/aleo.     So many miners hadenlisted that the Military   Authorities had to declino to takethem.Reporting on the Islington   Sub-CBmmittee of tfte Londonlocal Committee, our Inspector states that he inspected the recordsof this Committee for disabled soldiers and he found that the workwas being well done.&apos;      The case -papers and   Minute Books werewell kept.     Some 500 caooc had been dealt with before Christmasand about 30C have been dealt with since.       Only in a very fewcases has work not been found for applicants.     There has been nodifficulty in this District in dealing with cases of consumption.CLASS W. RES5RVU.The following received from the Middlesbrough Local&quot;Committee is typical of the state of affairs regarding Class YJ.men:-&quot;Generally speaking the facts are that the men have beenplaced with firms engaged on  Munitions as Glass &quot;YJ&quot; Workers, andon account of injuries received whilst on Active Service theyhave been laid off work, through illness caused or aggravatedby such Active Service and whilst off work the man and his familyhave been in many cases practically destitute.     One case inparticular where the man has been gassed twice at the Frcnt wastransferred to Class&apos;W, and cent to work at the   Cargo Fleet IronWorks, Middlesbrough, and ?*as unable to continue and he died .onThursday the 27th ultimo, and although the facto have been fullyreported to the Ministry of $limitions the man xs family are stillwithout the slightest financial assistance.&quot;Hy Committee do feel very strongly that they should begiven some instructions immediately which will enable them todeal with these oases.&quot;Our Committee have therefore instructed mo to prosevery strongly for some immediate action to be taken, and I shallbe glad to hear from you with some definite instructionsimmediately&quot;.

APPENDIX IV.THE NAVAL AND MILITARY WAR PENSIONS, &amp;c,. - -i -  AGT, 19x5. j^ij-CARE, TREATMENT, TRAINING, AND EMPLOYMENT OFDISCHARGED DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS. :Report upon Proposed Co-operation between War Pensions Committebs.Education Authorities, and Other Bodies in Lancashire.1 Under the provisions of.the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, 1915,a separate &quot;Local Committee &quot; has been established for each Borough and UrbanDistrict in Lancashire having a population of over 20,000, and one more to cover theremainder of the County, with the result that, including the County &quot; Local Com-mittee,&quot; there are 41 &quot; Local Committees &quot; in the Geographical County.2 By Section 4 (/) of the Act it is the duty of these Committees &quot; to make provision,subject to the approval of the Statutory Committee for the care of disabled officersand men after they have left the service, including provision for their health, train-ing, and employment,&quot; but the Institutions and organisations, so far as they now,exist, for giving instruction and training are under the control of the EducationAuthorities, Universities, and other Special Trusts ; and for affording medical andphysical treatment are under the control of the Military Authorities and variousAssociations, Charities, and other bodies.3 The provision for either treatment or training in the area of any particular&quot; Local Committee &quot; may largely partake of a special character which could provide,or could be easily extended to provide, treatment or training for a number of menresident in other areas, while, on the other hand, disabled men resident in one areamight require the special treatment or training that could be more economicallyprovided in some other area.4 The financial responsibility for the expenditure in making provision for helpingthe disabled rests with the Ministry of Pensions and the Statutory Committee, andthe money is to be provided out of Imperial Funds and not out of local rates. Atthe same time it is to the direct interest of every ratepayer (who is also a taxpayer)and the Councils who represent the ratepayers, to assist in helping the responsibleAuthorities in effecting the purposes desired at the least possible expense to theImperial Exchequer.        .5 Co-operation between the 41 &quot; Local Committees &quot; in Lancashire seemedobviously desirable, and as the additional expenditure which may be thrown uponLocal Authorities in helping the &quot; Local Committees &quot; to carry out their schemes isto be met out of Imperial Funds, then it is also obvious, in the general interests ofthe Country and of the County, that the total capacity of the Local Authoritieswhich may be available for giving this assistance should be co-ordinated and madeavailable for the whole County without regard to Local Areas.6 A Conference of Representatives of &quot; Local Committees,&quot; Education Authors-ties, and other bodies in Lancashire, convened by the Lord Lieutenant of the County,was held in Preston on the 16th of February last, when Mr. G N. Barnes, M.P., ^he-Minister of Pensions, and Sir Arthur Griffiths-Boscawen, M.P., the ParliamentarySecretary to the Ministry, were present and addressed the meeting and stronglysupported the&apos;idea of co-operative action among the &quot;Local Committees,&quot; Wie-Education Authorities, and other bodies.At that Conference the following resolutions were passed : -That the principle should he accepted thaj) it is the duty of theImperial Government to provide out of Imperial Funds the necessary costof dealing with disabled sailprs and. soldiers ; and further, that the increasedexpenditure thrown upon Local Education Authorities and other bodies inmaking provision for disabled sailors and soldiers should be repaid by, theGovernment.
(2) That for the purpose of rfche care, training, and employment of disabled&apos;    sailors and soldiers who may be&quot; resident in Lancashire, it is desirable thatco-operation should exist between the different War Pensions Committeesin the County, the Education Authorities, the Branches of the Red CrossSociety, and the Lord Roberts&apos; Memorial Workshops and other bodies.(3) That a Committee be appointed to report generally on the availablesources of supply for training disabled men in the County, and to suggest themanner in which, in their opinion, the facilities could be best adapted to meetthe requirements of the whole County.(4) That a Committee be appointed to consider and report generally onthe question of co-operation among the War Pensions Committees with regardto carrying out their powers and duties.7 We are the Committee appointed &quot;to consider and report generally on the&quot; question of co-operation among the War Pensions Committees with regard to&quot; carrying out their powers and duties.&quot;8 In the first place, we had to ascertain the existing available power of the County,as a whole, to afford facilities for either treatment or training of the disabled men,and as regards training we had to wait for the report of the Committee appointedspecially for that purpose.m9 That Committee have prepared an admirable and useful report, and for con-venience and to save delay, we take the liberty of printing it as Appendix I. tothis Report, and beg to call special attention to it.10      We have also received great assistance from Surgeon-General Hathaway, theDeputy Director of Medical Services of the Western Command, and other officers in. gaining information as to the number, situation, and treatment afforded at the variousMilitary and other Hospitals at which soldiers and sailors are now treated, and a listof these Institutions is printed as Appendix II.11 We have also to thank the Secretary of each &quot; Local Committee &quot; in the Countyfor making a return containing information with regard to the Hospitals and kindredInstitutions situate in, or particularly available for, the area of his &quot;Local Com-mittee.&quot; This return is also printed and a copy forwarded herewith, and will befound very useful for reference.12 Prom the information that has been laid before us, and after a full considerationof the subject, we are unanimously of opinion that a scheme for co-operative actionamong the &quot; Local Committees &quot; in the County is not only desirable, but is the onlymethod by which each &quot; Local Committee &quot; will be able practically to carry out itsduties with efficiency, convenience, and economy.13 This, in our opinion, can be done by a centralized body collecting and distributinghelpful information as regards the conditions prevailing in the County, and in suggest-ing action which will tend to bring about, as far as possible, uniformity of administra-tion and economy throughout the whole County Area, but without in any way in-fringing upon the executive powers of a &quot; Local Committee.&quot; The &quot; LocalCommittees &quot; in the County are simply agents to help and advise the Minister ofPensions and the Statutory Committee in London in the proper administration ofImperial Funds, and each &quot; Local Committee &quot; will be furthering the public interestby assisting, as far as possible, other Committees.14 We, therefore, recommend that an Advisory Committee consisting of one repre-sentative of each of the &quot; Local Committees &quot; be appointed, and that the membersof the Committee who prepared the report on training facilities in the County be-also made members of that Committee, and that a Secretary for the Committee be-^appointed,.whose office.will form a Central Bureau for the collection and distributionof information, and will be the official mouthpiece of the Advisory Committee. ThisAdvisory Committee should also have power to co-opt other persons as they maythink fit.15 The expense connected with this Central Bureau, if not paid entirely out of- Imperial Funds, will at any rate be met to the extent of two-thirds from that source,&quot;and the balance will be in that case a negligible item when apportioned among the&apos;   41 &quot; Local Committees.&quot;
16 The functions of the proposed Advisory Committee may he generally expressedto be that where each of many &quot; Local Committees &quot; may require a service, hutnot sufficient in extent to justify a special expenditure in the Local Area to satisfyit, the Committee will be able to focus the requirements of all those Committees, and.possibly be able to suggest a scheme which can be carried out to meet the combineddemand with a reasonable expenditure.16(a) So far as any such suggested scheme may relate to training in Technicaland other Educational Institutions it would be sent to the Education Authority,or other body controlling the Institution affected, and then it would rest with thatAuthority or body to deal with the proposal as they may think fit.16(&amp;) If the scheme should have reference to the extension of Hospital or Hostelaccommodation and treatment to meet the County requirements, the AdvisoryCommittee themselves would be a useful medium for pressing the subject forwardon behalf of all the &quot; Local Committees.&quot;17 The staff of the Advisory Committee, which we designate as the &quot;CentralBureau,&quot; would be the medium for bringing the &quot;Local Committee&quot; requiring anytreatment or training for a man into direct communication with the Institutioncapable at the moment of supplying it, and it might usefully keep a register of hostelsand lodging-houses suitable for men to go to, who may require accommodation inany district, while receiving out-door treatment at a Hospital, or training.18 The information collected from and supplied to the different &quot; Local Com-mittees &quot; would also materially help towards uniformity in their administration andpractice.19 But it is not our purpose to attempt to formulate any exact description of thefunctions of the Advisory Committee and their Central Bureau. All we desire to dois to recommend that they be appointed for the general purposes we have indicated,and then to leave the development of their activities to rest on the experience thatmay be gained of their usefulness.20 The duties of &quot; Local Committees &quot; are becoming pressingly urgent to be carriedout, and no time can be lost in useless formalities of procedure, and we, therefore,take the responsibility of asking the Honorary Secretary to call a meeting of theChairman, Vice-Chairman, and Clerk of each &quot; Local Committee &quot; in the County, tobe held at the County Offices, Preston, on Monday next, the 21st of May, at 11-15o&apos;clock, to receive and consider this report, and, if approved, to constitute the AdvisoryCommittee.EDWARD COZENS-HARDY,Chairman,On behalf of the Members of the Committee.County Offices, Preston,14th May, 1917.
APPENDIX I.TRAINING FOR DISABLED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.REPORT OF THE FACILITIES COMMITTEE.Referenoe to j Your Committee were instructed to report generally on the available sourcesCommittee.   ^ gUpply for training disabled men in the County, and to suggest the manner inwhich, in their opinion, the facilities could best be adapted to meet the requirementsof the whole County.Circular ofEnquiry.Nature ofIteplies.2. At their first meeting the Committee resolved to issue a circular to all the Edu-cation Committees in the Geographical County in whose areas it seemed likely thatfacilities for training disabled men could be provided during the day time. Thecircular was accompanied by a Form, on which details of the various facilities couldbe stated, and by a suggestive list of trades which appear to be suitable to varioustypes of disabled men.3. Replies to the circular were received from 56 Authorities, of whom allwere willing to make their resources available for training men, so far as it lay in theirpower to do so. The accompanying list has been compiled from their returns ; thelist is not to be regarded as a definite and detailed undertaking that the LocalEducation Authorities will set up classes in the various sub j ects mentioned, but rather asa broad indication of the main lines on which the existing facilities of the Authoritieswill enable them to co-operate in the work of training. In a number of areas theTechnical School is largely used for educational purposes during the day, includingtraining for war work, and, therefore is not available at all, or is only free as regardscertain special rooms. In other districts, although the building may be unoccupiedduring the day, the facts that it does not possess equipment of any special character,and that it is situated near to one or more large towns which afford better facilitiesfor establishing efficient classes, seem to the Committee to prevent its effective inclu-sion in the scheme, at any rate for the moment.Basis on 4. In the list of facilities which they have prepared the Committee have soughtwhich replies to select from the information before them those areas where training for particularSummarised, trades can be carried out under the best conditions. They believe that it would be. preferable to provide thoroughly good opportunities of training at a limited numberof centres, rather than a much larger number, in some of which, at least, trainingcould only be of a partial character. By following such a policy, not only is thetraining likely to be more efficient, but the expenses will be materially reduced, asthe number of men desiring training would probably be so limited at the smallerschools as to make the cost per head very heavy. The omission of any particularschool, or any department of a school, from the list must not in any wise be construedas implying any reflection upon the purpose which it is intended to serve in a normalsystem of Technical Education. It will be recognised that the requirements ofuseful work for a special scheme of this character may be very different from thosegoverning either Day or Evening Technical Instruction.Finance. 5. The Committee have given some consideration to the financial aspect of thescheme, which has been prepared on the express understanding that the cost willbe adequately met by the Ministry of Pensions. On -that understandingthey unanimously recommend that some arrangement, embodying the principle of aflat rate, should be adopted by the Statutory Committee in regard to the paymentto be made to any Authority undertaking the training. They would point out thatsuch a scheme has already been adopted by the War Office in arranging for thetraining in Technical Institutions of men of the Royal Flying Corps.In the opinion of the Committee, it will, however, be necessary to fix differentialrates for various types of work, inasmuch as the cost of instruction varies so greatly,e.g., between Elementary Commercial Courses and many Advanced Courses ofTechnical Instruction. The rates of payment should be such as would on the averagecover the total additional cost to the Authority, other than purely administrativecharges, and it is suggested that the Authority should waive any claims for rent oftheir own premises and in respect of capital expenditure. Such a plan of flatrates would result in much saving of time which would otherwise be spent bothby the Education and the Pensions Authorities in bookkeeping and making outreturns.
Suggested 6. Another matter which is of the utmost importance is the necessity forBureau of some machinery whereby sufficient men can be collected desiring instruction in aparticular subject at a given place to make it possible to establish a class for them ;but this problem seems rather to belong to the province of the other Committeeappointed by the Conference. It should, however, be pointed out that therewill be difficulties in making complete and satisfactory use of the educationalfacilities of the County unless some provision be made for a bureau of informationat the service of the whole Geographical County. For example, it might happenthat one large County Borough had a few applications for a particular subject, whileanother also had a few. The combined number might justify the establishment ofa class in one of them, but this could not easily take place unless some means wereprovided whereby the facts would be brought before both Authorities, with a viewto arranging at which centre the particular type of work should be conducted.Otherwise it might not be done in either. Such an arrangement, of course, wouldnot interfere with the establishment by any Education Committee of a class in asubject for which it has already obtained a sufficient number of names.7. Education Authorities ought to have, at the earliest possible moment, anintimation of the number of men for whom any particular type of training is likely tobe required by a given date. They must, of course, have timely notice, sinceadditional staff may be required, or possibly a temporary abandonment of otheruseful but less important and urgent work. It should also be mentioned that inmany courses it would be unwise to receive fresh applicants after a certain stage inthe instruction had been reached. Such applicants might have to wait until the nextcourse commenced. On the other hand, it is recognised that it is very desirablethat the men should enter on their training as soon as possible after leaving theHospital.Co-operation       8. An important consideration to bear in mind is that a number of Educationof Employers. Authorities are relying on the co-operation of private as well as public employersin training men.   Such assistance has actually been offered in some areas, and thispoints to a means whereby the facilities for training can be almost indefinitelyextended.The Committee desire to thank the various Education Authorities who haveresponded with the utmost willingness to the requests for information which havebeen made to them.A.

APPENDIX V.The- Itath^meelJjag, ctf^t^ waSwheJLcLm24 th May.        Present:-Sir A, Boscawen, andSir John Collie,Dr. C*Hc.Bon&amp;,Dr. Fox-Simons,Dr. Hartley, and JCor part of the timeSir Mi Nathan.1, The Minutes of the last meeting were taken as readand signed.2, Neurasthenics,, Sir J* Collie presente&amp;his report.The Medical Officer was in residence at the Home at SoldersGreem; 40 patients were coming in on Tuesday and there was along waiting lisi* Another Institution was urgentlyneeded, Gclders Green having accommodation only for IOC,Sir Arthur Bos*awen called attention to the importanceof fixing the per capita charge at Gclders Green; though thiswas a matter for the Ministry it required early settlement.   Itwas stated that there was a proposal before the Red CrossSociety; Dr Fox-Symons promised to have it   icoked up and sentoni      It was promised that inquiry should he made as to thedelay in printing the leaf lets *With regard to further accommodation Sir ArthurBescaweia called attention to the Recuperative Hostel inPitzjohn!s Avenue, Hampstead, started by Sir F, Milner*    Hesuggested that it would life desirable to recognise this Institu-tlca subject to the provisions made by him in his letter ofMay 21st to Sir John Collie, viz, that&apos;no patient there shouldhave the advantages of Article 6 of the Warrant except such aswere certified as suitable oases by the Special Board; thatthe charges per capita   should in no case exceed that at  older&apos;sGreen
Green, and that the patients should be re-examined by theSpecial Board every few weeks.     Attention was also directed tothe Farm Colony which Sir p. Milner was establishing in Essex.It was agreed to recommend that the Recuperative Hostelshould bo recognised on this understanding, and that the FarmColony should be recognised as a place to which convalescentsmight for light employment be sent, though the latter did notappear to be suitable as a place of training.Sir John Collie undertook to make the necessaryarrangements on hearing from the Ministry that recognition hadbeen granted.There was some discussion as to the form of &quot;Awards&quot;and it was pointed out in cases where Institutional Treatmentwas desired a temporary pension must be recommended in orderthat Clause 6 of the Warrant may be utilised.Sir A. Boscawen mentioned that the Ministry hadreceived through Major C.G.Hamilton, M.P., the offer of a houseat Altrincham near Manchester with provision towards the main-tenance;   it was hoped that this house would be available forNeurasthenic cases;   Major Hamilton would visit it shortly andreport further to Sir A. Boscawen.Sir John Collie mentioned that the Ulster VolunteerForce would carry on Craig Avon, where the Officers and Staff hadbeen appointed;   some alterations were necessary and there hadbeen difficulties in obtaining the requisite material;   it wasagreed that on receipt of the necessary information the Secretaryshould write to the Ministry of Munitions.Sir John Collie read a report on Intensive Culture fromDr. Gilbert Scott, the Medical officer at Golders Groen, relativeto the suitability of Intensive Culture as an employment forNeurasthenic cases.     Major Frazer, the expert, was ready, subjecto satisfactory terms, tongive up his garden at Preston Parkif the staff was taken over together with the equipment ata valuation.    Major Frazer would be ready to liveat
at GoMers, Green and to supervise Vn&amp; whole garden .   I was thought that the valuation would be between X600-and  J70&amp;*and it was agreed to recommend to the Red Cross Society thatthe necessary expenditure should be defrayed out of the fundprovided by them.Dr. Bond spoke from personal knowledge of the valueof Intensive Culture as an employment for Epileptic patients.Sir A, Boscawen pointed out that Major Prazer&apos;sremuneration and expenses would have to be defrayed as partof the expenses of the Home, and should be taken Into accountin fiaag the charge.Sir J. Collie stated that Sir G. Newman of Braintree,jBssaex, hoped to be able to provide light agricultural workfor 30 or 40 Neurasthenic cases, and that Lord Montagu ofBoaulieu would take 6 woodmen and dome others.5.      Tuberculosis.    Dr. Hartley reported that the Metropoli-tan Asylums Board had granted about 150 beds, viz., apavilion in each $f 7 of their Hospitals at Hither Green,Hcmerton, Hampstead, New Cross and 3 others.    The cost wouldbe froii 35/- to 40/- a week.    They were making a beginningof cases, and Mr Hore was arranging the necessary procedurefor the selection and admission       patients.VUith regard to provincial areas Dr. Hartley recommendedthe building of  mail temporary-jpavilicns in connection withCounty Fever Hospitals or Sanatoria.      He suggested, as astart, that two should be provided at Bury and Eccles fthLancashire, and one at Birmingham.   The Medical Officer atBirmingham thought that the Local Authority would take over themanagement. He brought up a plan of a suggested pavilion for Ifbeds which was to be standardized,and would permit in each cas$f duplication. The estimated cost at the present time would beabout  960.   The proposed Scheme would have the advantages offitting in with existing organizations and of placing patientsnear their homes.   The Scheme had received the approval of MriStanley
P Stanley and ofoir Wei t*r&quot;-Lawrence.    It &quot;/as agreed torecommend the adoption of the Scheme :.n principle.As to the Officers Dr. Hartley thought there was atpresent no great need for aceomodation; there were placesavailable at Midhurst and Pinewood, and improved pensionswould meet the financial question which was the most commondifficulty.......... - --     &quot; &apos; .-4. Epileptics. &quot;&quot;&quot;Dr Bond reported that at Lingfield three villasfor 25 cases each were In preparation^     A workshop was wanted,and could be built, on a plan which Dr Bond had approved, in sixweeks;   this building would be suitable for temporary use as aWard for 30 beds, which like the villas was to be for dischargedsoldiers only; the cost was not specified.     The Scheme had theapproval of lir Stanley.Dr Bond expressed high opinion of athe Lingfield colonywhere there was a most competent, resident Officer.     The Committee;accepted the principle of the proposed scheme and recommended thatsubject to satisfactory estimates the expenditure both for thevillas and workshops should be approved.*Sir       Hathan. called attention to the importance of co-cordinating the provisien for Epileptics with the areas of theJoint Committees.     This was recognised, but it was pointed outin discussion that under existing circumstancesf at all events.Epilepsy must be dealt with Centrally, though ultimately it wasdesirable that places should be found for all cases as near theirhomes as possible.Dr Bond advised that a letter should be addressed toLingfleld enquiring whether, pending the erection of the proposedbuildings a limited number of urgent cases could, be admitted andasking what weekly charge would be made.   It was agreed that a letf^letter should be sent in the terms of a draft supplied by Dr Bond..It was stated that the probable charge would be 16/6 a week.Dr. Bond read a-lettear from the Superintendent ofLingfield dated 21st May relative to. the Application Forms,
Forms in use at that Institution;    It was felt that the Forma   \would he difficult to fill up in the case of dischargedsoldiers, and Dr. Bond undertook to endeavour to arrange for.their simplification.    ffc&amp; maximum information available wascontained on the Medical History Sheets and the reports of theInvaliding Boards; this though sometimes valuable was oftenmeagre.    It was agreed that arrangement should be made forDr. Bond to be furnished with copies from Chelsea.Dr. Bond stated various points raised by Dr. Griffithof Lingfleld (1)   He was accuebomed to make weekly grants ofpocket money; could this be done in the case of Soldiers?   Itwas felt that the men would not require more than the Warrantprovided and that it it was intended to suggest that the pensionshould be 4oled out this was beyond our power.   ( )   What wouldhis disciplinary powers be?  The same as with other siviliampatients; the possible loss or diminution of pension would bea further motive for good conduct,   (3) Hor would dischargesbe effected?    C&amp; the advice of the Superintendent,At Maghull the aew buildings would not be completedbefpre the end of September; they would provide 80 beds.   Thesuggested use of the Church House had fallen through, and Dr.Bond had inquired as to the possibility of temporary accommOda-tion.    In reply he had received from Mir Grisewoed a letter dated22nd May ?*hich raised other issues.      It was agreed that i-lr,Grisewocd should be invited to attend a meeting of the Committeeand discus8 the subject.A letter from Sir Haraourt Clare relative to the useof the Ribchester WorlCiouse was read.    Dr. Bond summarised thehistory of the building as known to him, which showed that theLocal Government Board had definite views as regards the Buildingand that the use of it could only be obtained through them;   Hethought that it would be suitable for Epileptic cases. *Sir A. Boseawen stated that he would write to SirHarecurt
,1 I&quot;- CiHarcourt Clare inquiring whether, if the Ministry couldObtain the consent of the Local Government Board, theLancashire Joint Committee would provide for its managementand could also find the money required for its extablishment,(In default thereof the Institutional Committee could probablyarrange for it,)Dr, Bond called attention to the Epileptic Colonyat Billericay in Essex,     He believed it was run on commerciallines, and therefore he had not brought it up*     It was agreedthat Dr. Bond might make inquiry,5,     Future Meetings,   It v/as agreed that the next twomeetings should be held on Thursday, 31st May and Thursday7th June at 11 o1clock and that the subjects for considerationshould be:-31st May:    (1) Paraplegics (2) Tuberculosis: (3) Arrangementswith the Red Cross Society,7th June: (1) Epileptics and (2) Neurasthenics *
THE FIRST HOME OF RECOVERY,GOLDERS GREEN, N.W. 4.For the cure of Neurasthenia and other Functional Diseasesof the Nervous System.FOR DISCHARGED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.Sufferers from Neurasthenia and other functional Nervous disorders do not alwaysrealise that their condition is essentially one that can be cured. In the case of thedischarged soldier it frequently happens that slow progress has fostered a gloomyattitude towards his prospects of recovery, but in fresh surroundings these prospectsare often very good.Men suffering from the results of Shell Shock, with inability to walk, and certainforms of paralysis, tremors, stammering, or depression, are especially suitable fortreatment.Golclers Green is a Home of Recovery in which all patients are civilians ; and itsobject is speedily to restore to health those suffering from Nervous complaints caused bytheir war service.The Home has been provided in accordance with arrangements made by theJoint Institutional Committee of the Pensions Ministry, the British Red Cross Societyand Order of St. John, the War Office and the Statutory Committee. The capitalexpenditure has been generously provided by the Joint War Committee of the BritishRed Cross and Order of St. John, while the cost of maintenance will be defrayed bythe Pensions Ministry in accordance with the terms of the new Warrant. The Homeis under the management of the Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases, andthe Honorary Medical Staff are the Physicians.The latest methods of Medical treatment are employed. Each patient willreceive individual attention. In the grounds there is ample scope for out-of-door workand recreation of every sort.There are Workshops in which patients may obtain occupation, and, if desired,skilled instruction.Arrangements are made to find suitable work for patients when they leave.(b 9428)   Wt. 6427-g9   5ii   5/17   H &amp; S
aSpecial Provision for the Families of Patients.Generous terms have been granted by the Ministry of Pensions, so that all whoenter the Home may know that their wives and families are amply provided forin their absence.The wife or dependent will be paid a weekly Family Allowance sufficient tomaintain them independently of any assistance from the patient whilst he is in theHome.   Allowances for children will also be made.To those who desire to enter the Home the following amounts, therefore, will beassured : Single Men. Married Men.27/6 per week. 27/6 per week.13/9 for wife.An allowance will be made 5/- for first child.for dependents. 4/2 for second child.3/4 for third child.2/6 for each of the other children.A small deduction will be made from the man&apos;s allowance for his board, but thetreatment will be provided&apos; free.It will be seen, therefore, that whilst the patient is in the Home the FamilyAllowance for wife and children will be paid to the wife or dependent ; and in additionthe full pension of 27/6, less a small deduction for board, will be paid to the patient.As his personal expenses will be trifling, it should be possible for him to send asubstantial additional weekly allotment to his wife and family.The Home is in no sense a Military Hospital; no patient can be retained againsthis will.Applications for admission to be made to :Sir John Collie, M.D.,78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2.The Military Service (Review of Exceptions) Act does not extend to any officeror man who has left or been discharged from the Naval or Military Service of theCrown in consequence of neurasthenia or allied functional nervous disease if socertified by a special medical board to be the result of naval or military service in thepresent war.It is hoped that Local Committees will assist in nominating suitable cases. Noexpense will fall on the Local Committees.
