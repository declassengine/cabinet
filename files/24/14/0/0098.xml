From Sir P. Cox, Basra, 29th May 1917.(Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State.)(Received at India Office, 30th May, 2 p.m.)1903. Reference Secretary of State&apos;s telegram, dated 23rd May. Officersfor Mesopotamia. As regards Knox. Hardship to him lies in the fact thatBasra alone offers him no career in the judicial line.&apos; He has a natural bentfor judicial work, has made a practical success of jxidicial administration ofBasra, and naturally looked forward to prospect of advancement in theevent of extension of&apos; our control to the Bagdad Vilayet. In existingcircumstances 1 imagine he will apply to return to India, and will feel thathis three years&apos; hard work in these territories has been wasted as far as hisfuture career is concerned.As regards Revenue Administration. I have read Secretary of State&apos;stelegram of 10th May and understand it, but I would ask him to rememberthat for the period of the war there cannot be two.Army Commanders insupreme control in occupied territory nor two Chief Political Officers, andthat I am responsible to Army Commander and to Government for civiladministration of both Vilayets. In the matter of revenue administrationwe have adopted in its entirety the Turkish -system which is the same forboth Vilayets. It is clearly opposed to interests of inhabitants and toprinciples of good government that identical questions arising in the twoVilayets should be handled differently. What I need is the services of anofficer of adequate weight and revenue experience as my Revenue Secretaryor Staff Officer to whom I can go for advice with regard to revenue questionsand can give supervisory powers over the working of both Vilayets to ensureconsistency of treatment. Dobbs would have suited me well. As he is notavailable another officer of the same type is needed, and as revenue systemof these territories is quite different from that of India and of Egj^pV itmatters little whence the officer comes as long as he possesses rightqualities.As regards present arrangements. Though as a matter of fact onemember of my &quot;Revenue Board &quot; is now running Basra Vilayet and theother the Bagdad Vilayet, and they have doubtless separated for good, yet,pending the appointment of Revenue Secretary, asked for I have to maintainthe institution &quot;Revenue Board&quot; to ensure that there is no differentialtreatment of identical problems. I hope officer will be nominated as soon aspossible.As far as I can see some such supervisory post will continue to benecessary after the war with the same object in view, but that is a questionwhich can be considered by Commission.
