Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.SECTION   D.pRg/005.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. V.May 24, 1917.Opening of the Parliamentary Session.Mr Bratianu returned from Petrograd on May 16 in time forthe meeting of Parliament which had been summoned for May 17.He declared himself &quot;entirely satisfied with the conversationshe had had with the Russian Government and other officials&quot;.Even if these conversations were as satisfactory as Mr Bratianustates, It is doubtful if they will lead for the moment to amore sympathetic attitude on the part of the Russian Governmentand nation towards Rumania.   Rumania is not in favour at presenteither with the army or the nation generally.   The Socialistsand Jews will only abandon their dislike and distrust ofRumania as a land of boyars and anti-Semites when they seedefinite and far-reaching reforms proposed and carried inParliament.     Rumanian national claims cannot even appeal to thesupport of Slav sentiment in Russia, whatever that counts fornow.   The only member of the Government Mr Bratianu saw who islikely to have been at all favourable to his statement ofRumania&apos;s case is Mr Milyukov, who, in spite of his sympathieswith Bulgaria, was always willing to extend a certain measureof support to any claims of Rumania he thought justified. .But on the day on which Mr Bratianu got back to Iasi Mr Milyukovresigned, and, therefore, any friendly relations Mr Bratianumay have established with the late Foreign Minister are unlikelyto count for much with his successor and his Socialist colleagues.
At the meeting of the Rumanian Chamber mn May iq, Mr Bratianuread a Government declaration requesting Parliament. to insertin the Rumanian Constitution two great principles:   universalsuffrage and expropriation of the land in favour of thepeasants.   He added that these principles would Toe studiedat leisure so that their application should he practical andeffective.   The Government was also considering other plans,including the Jewish question, which had arisen, at an opportunemoment.     There seems to he little doubt that the RumanianGovernment at least feels the need, even if it is not enthusiasticabout the principle, of completely democratising the franchiseand the ownership of the land.    It is to &quot;be hoped that thesetwo reforms,which have been promised by the King and outlinedby the Government, will pass through Parliament quickly andwithout much reactionary opposition.       This is essential to thefavourable reinstatement of Rumania in Russian and Americanopinion.On the question of the Jews Mr Bratianu is less satisfactory.The important agrarian and financial interests, which to a largeextent control his own National Liberal Party and still morethat of his old opponents the Conservatives, probably stillcount for much in delaying and hampering any complete equalisationof the Jews with the other inhabitants of the country.Mr Bratianu was very slow to realise the urgency of the Jewishquestion, and but for his able colleague&apos;s, Fir Take Iones.cu&apos;s,insistence would probably once&apos;again have procrastinatedas he has often done before.       There seems little doubt that theconjecture put forward by Sir George Barclay in a recent wirethat Mr Ionescu was chiefly responsible for the inclusion of
jewish reform in the Government&apos;s progranme is entirely correct.It is useless to hope, however, that in spite of the criticalnature of the situation all parties will he agreed in Rumaniaon the advisability and urgency of granting full rights to thejews.     There are certain to be fierce anti-Semitic outburstsin the Chamber and probably speeches against any measures proposedwill be made by such deputies as Cuza and the famous historianProfessor Iorga.     But the whole question of Jewish reform isclosely bound up with that of franchise and agrarian reform andall three questions must be resolutely dealt with if Rumanianinternal affairs are to be put on a proper democratic footingand Rumania is to improve her international status.       The creationof a Great Rumania, including the Rumanian parts of Hungary,is for two reasons dependent on the introduction and execution ofthese reforms:(I) Transylvanians will only come into union with Rumaniaif assured that the Government of the country is henceforth tobe resolutely democratic in character.(2) Rumania can only be assured cf the sympathy of the GreatPowers for her well-justified racial aspirations if she sets herown house in order and grants full rights of equality to thepeasants and the Jews.The. Military Situation.Fighting has been almost at a standstill for the last fourmonths.       In a New York Serbian paper which has come to hand aninterview is given with an American airman, a certain Mr Bert Hall,&apos;&quot;ho has just returned from, the Rumanian front.    In this Interview   *ft   ..
he declares that there is practically not a German soldierleft there and that the enemy armies consist wholly ofBulgarians, Turks and Austro-Hungarians.     This statementseems to he more or less justified.The Occupied Territories.In my weekly Reports on Bulgaria I have already dealtwith the fact that the Bulgarians are claiming the whole ofDobrogea as Bulgarian territory,   Considerable propagandais being carried on and the Bulgarisation or, as it is claimed,re-Bulgarisation of various districts of Dobrogea is proceedingapace..     Even the Bulgarian Socialists at Stockholm have putin a claim for the incorporation of Dobrogea in Bulgaria,  andthe Bulgarian press is full of &quot;proofs&quot; of the Bulgariancharacter of nearly all the towns of Dobrogea, even as farNorth as Tulcea on one of the mouths of the Danube.I have no recent evidence as to the character of theBulgarian administration.    It is certain that during the firstBulgarian advance into the province the Bulgarian armiescommitted atrocities on the civilian population, though theBulgarians claim that the Rumanian armies during their retreatbehaved atrociously to the Bulgar population.A.W.A.L.Eay 24, 1917.
