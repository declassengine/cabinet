FOTE EY TEE SECRETARY&quot;;.As Secretary cf the War Cabinet I feel hound to call attentionto the fact that the business of the War Cabinet has for sometime been seriously in arrears,   At one time, the War Cabinetpractically caught up all arrears of rcrk, but latterly they havebeen accumulating rather alarmingly.    Before submitting a sug-gestion for improving the position it may be useful to mention somefacts in support of the above statement.The Secretary prepares at the end of each reek a list ofsubjects a-aiting consideration,  and this, kept daily, and,  indeed,hourly, up to date,  serves as the basis fcr draring up the AgendaPapers for the follrving reek.     The Immediate List issued on Kay 6th,only contained 14 subjects.     The list fur the present reek contains25 subjects;    that for the previous reek contained 22 subjects.Questions    cf some considerable importance have been delayedrather seriously, and there are a number of minor questions whichrequire to be dealt with.     Perhaps the most important rf thelarger questions for decision is the suggestions raised in LordCurzenVa Report en the Possible Secession of Russia from the Entente.This has been discussed once at the War Cabinet,  but i v/as absentand no Secretary v/as present.     I understand, h or ever,  that nodecisions were taken on Lord Curzcn&apos;s suggestions.     Another questioncf great importance which has been raiting fcr a reek is the Reportof the Committee assembled to consider Sir Leo Chiozza honey&apos;;:Proposals in regard to the concentration rf purchases, as far as.vPOsruble,  in the United States of America.     Some minor questionsWe been raiting for some reeks and have appeared several times on
the Agenda Paper:   for example, MrLProthero1s Memorandum onSulphate of Ammonia, 3 weeks:   Becruitmont in India of Men forLabour Battalions ana Lumbermen, 2 weeks;   Memorandum by theMinistry of Munitions on Paper and Pater-making Materials(which, however, I am trying to get settled outside), 4 weeks;Interim Report of the Committee on the War Expansion of PablicDepartments, 4 weeks;   Memorandum by the Secretary, of State forthe Colonies on the Salay States and Kubber Industries, 2 weeks;tho Proposed Transfer fcf the Powers and Duty of the StatutoryCommittee to the Ministry of Pensions, 2 weeks;   as well asseveral other questions.For the last few weeks the Weekly List has been scrutinisedby the Secretary very carefully, and efforts have been nnde toget many of the questions dealt with outside the ufar Cabinet.There is undoubtedly a tendency on the part of Departments tothrow decisions on to the V/ar Cabinet which are well withinthe competence of the Departments themselves and could bearrived at in consultation with father Departments without troublingthe V/ar Cabinet.   By these means the War Cdfc.inet has beenrelieved of a very considerable mass of minor business whichought not to engage their attention at all, and tho process isbeing continued.     Many oases occur, ha.&apos;ever, in which theDepartments do not feel justified in acting without a Cabinetdecision, and questions have sometimes to be brought beforethe Cabinet which, in my personal opinion, could be settledoutside.I have been very careflilly considering the best methodof alleviating this congestion, and have had the matter con-stantly in mind during the meetings of tho War Cabinet.     Theconclusion I have come to is that the accumulation ariseslargely owing to the order in which the business.of the Cabinetis conducted.     I have observed that the daily statements andthe discussions which c rise therefrom quite commonly occupy
-a. 275the first hour of the Cabinet Meeting.     Very often the dailystatements give rise to a discussioii on some great question ofpolicy, and important matters on the Agenda Peper are squeezed,out.     For example, the question of Sslonica and Greece, which,has occupied the attention of the Anglo-French Conference duringthe greater part of today, arose from a statement &quot;by Lord Derbyin regard to his visit to Paris last Thursday, and on that daypractically no other business was transacted.     If notice&apos; hadbeen given to the Secretary that this cuestion would have beenraised a gcod deal of inconvenience to Departmental Officerswarned in connection with the subjects on the Agenda Paper wouldhave been avoided.Moreover, even when the s&apos;tatements do not occupy so long8, time, questions connected with Parliamentary Debate, which, thoughof immediate urgency, are of much less intrinsic importance thanthe subjects on the Agenda Paper, often occupy a groat deal oftime.     When they do get to their Agenda Paper the Ylar Cabinetnaturally wish to devote themselves to the larger questions ofpolicy.     The result is that minor questions, whioh would oftentake only two or three minutes to settle, remain on the AgendaPaper week after week v/ithout being dealt with.This is unfortunate from every point of view.     lotonly do the questions remain unsettled, but the DepartmentalOfficers who are warned to hold themselves in readiness to dis-cuss these questions, and who are unable to make engagements atthat hour, are greatly inconvenienced.     Thus, an unfortunateimpression is apt to be created.The method which has latterly been most favoured bythe War Cabinet for getting rid of its accumulations of businessis to delegate to one or more Members the decision on the variouspoints.     This procedure , while it has disposed of a greatdeal of business, is not satisfactory in all cases, as it veryoften proves the question must come back for Cabinet decision.Moreover, the Members of the War Cabinet, who have /
not an unlimited omeunt of tine at their disposal, themselvesbecome overburdened with work.    Another method which has beensuggested is to   divide the work of the Cabinet into groups,each Minister supervising a group of Departments.     Tho objec-tion to this course is that the number of permutations andcombinations of groups is so great owing to the reaction onother Departments of questions which at first sight appear toaffect one or two Departments only.     For example, a questionof armaments for Russia or Roumania may be found ta reactvitally on the India office or on some Dominion Government, asif the needs of those countries are satisfied India or a Dominionmay have to go short:   or a question of apparently mainly domesticimportance, such as the Irish question, may have supremely impor-tent reactions in the Dominions and in foreign countries suchas the United States&apos;of America.     Or,again, a question offertilisers, which appears mainly to affect the Board of  Agri-culture, the Scottish Office and the Irish Office, is foundto be equally important from the point of view of the ShippingController and the Ministry of Munitions.     If groups v/ere formedit would be found that on nearly every-question it was necessaryto reconstitute them ad hoc   according to the interests &quot;thatwere affected.The solution which I would submit for the considerationof the War Cabinet is that in future the statements by theBaval, Military, and Foreign political Advisers of the Govern-ment should not take place at the beginning of the Meetingbut an hour or so later.     Tho first half hour, and,  indeed,the first hour when there are accumulations of work, should bedevoted to questions on the Agenda Paper which are not quiteof the first importance.     Then would come the statements onnaval, military and political matters, -which would immediatelybe followed by a discussion of some one great question ofpolicy, such as is at all times bofore the War Cabinet.
Discussions of these larger questions would, when necessary,be continued1 in the afternoon.    It is suggested that it would1not be necessary for-the whole of the War Cabinet invariablyto attend at the beginning&apos;-of the meeting for the less import-ant questions, but arrangements would have to be made alwaysto ensure that at least two Ministers were present.     When theaccumulation of work is heavy, as at present, the Meetingmight normally begin at 11 o1clock, but once arrears had beencaught up it is unlikely that this would be necessary morethan once or twice a week..I am confident that by means of this slight altera-tion in the procedure of the War Cabinet a very great improve-ment would be affected almost immediately in the transationof business.     I am the more assured of this that on dayswhen the usual statements are not given at the beginning ofa Meeting the War Cabinet invariably gets through its AgendaPaper and usually well before the ordinary time of adjournment.(Signed)   M.P.A.Hankey. , Whitehall Gardens, S.WMay 28th, 1917.
