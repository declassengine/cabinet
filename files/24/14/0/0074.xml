from Colonel3?.G. Marsh, Caucasus Military Agent,Dated Tiflis 27th April, 1917.Effect of the Bussian devolution upon the military situationon the Caucasus- and Persian Fronts, April, 1917.of the Viceroy of the Caucasus were taken over by a Board of 4.Commissioners on behalf of the temporary Government;   themilitary duties were taken up by General YUDMICE, formerlycommanding the Caucasus Army in the field, now styled:-&quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of the Caucasus Front&quot;.2. Major-General BOLXKOVITIIOF, formerly Chief of theStaff to General Yudenioh and at the same time to the Grand DukeNICHOLAS the Commander-in-Chief, became Director-General ofSupply of the Armies of the Caucasus front in place ofGeneral YAMSBEEVICH.3, Major General T0MI10F, formerly General Quartermasterto Genl. Yudenich, became Chief of the Staff of the Armies ofthe Caucasus front, and, together with that part of the staffwhich had hitherto lived permanently in the field, returnedto Tiflis, which became the Headquarters of the Armies of theCaucasus front.4. The Commands in the field were reorganised into twoarmies and two independent corps, as has been reported in .detail in separate communications.5, There are other great changes at the same time, notnecessitated by the change in the form of government; forinstance no less than four Corps Commanders were removed fromtheir appointments, two for incompetency, two for theirknovfli personal attachment to the old regime;   many divisionaland brigade commanders were also removed, and in some casesthe troops took matters into their own hands so far as toremove their own commanding officers.     Unpopular officers1.Towards the end of March, 1917, the political dutieswere
were maltreated and left their regiments in fear of theirlives, hut it is believed that no murder was committed on thisfront or at any station to the rear of it.     the men confinedthemselves to deserting in greater numbers then was usual beforethe revolution, and to asserting their new-found liberty bydeclining to perform any duties for which they felt disinclined.They did not, however, discontinue the military practice ofsaluting officers in uniform as in Petrograd and other pointson the rear.6.     large towns like BAKU and TIPIiIS were full ofcomparatively well-behaved soldiers, mostly absent withoutleave, and for some weeks after the outbreak of the &quot;revolutionit was impossible for any civilians but a man in fairly robusthealth and of some personal strength to travel by rail.     Orderis however now restored (April 1917), and the only men whotravel without paying for tickets are those who lie and sit on theroofs of the carriages, on the steps and in the passageways inthe carriages and between the carriages.   1 An attempt is nowbeing made CAp. 27th) to provide special trains for soldiers ontheir way to and from the front.     The disorder hithertoprevailing, was obviously due to the lack of any sort of properprovision for men to take leave, or to be conveyed by rail whenon leave.7. The restoration of discipline should be an easiermatter on the Caucasus fronts than in Sussis proper, for thereasons given above.     The men have been very moderate, and theofficers appear to recognise this, and are more ready to opengood relations again.     There is an extraordinary absence ofself-confidence among all ranks of officers;    their formerrelations with their men were evidently such that there are fewcases where officers can rely on even a few men who might forma nucleus of good influence in&apos; order to bring the rest to theirsenses.     The footing therefore is one of negotiation, a processwhich it is difficult for a British Officer to think of inconnection
connection with the men of his battalion or company.     It musthe remembered that the majority of the men are uneducated andthat reason and good feeling does not influence them.   Theyhave faith in their chosen leaders, at present, namely thelocal executive committees of the &quot;Council of Soldier andLabour Deputies11, and it is therefore important to get intotouch, with, and to influence these committees.8. General Yudenich, and the officers of the General Staffappointed by him, accordingly attend meetings of thecommittees and it is believed that.something like a &quot;modusVivendi11 if not of &quot;operandi17 is being attained.9. The problem which lies before General Yudenich. andthe General Staff is extraordinarily complex and difficult.IP. In the first ple.ce there is the question of discipline,the evolution of a new and more elastic system, foundedpartly on that which now exists in the French, and partly onwhat is here popularly believed to exist in the British Army.11. In the second place there is the question of carryingon the war, and the method to be employed.12&quot;. In both of these questions the local executivecommittee of the Council of Soldiers and labour Deputies hasat present a very great interest;   and it may have apreponderating influence in the eventual decision.13. The Executive Committee at the present time sit in thebuilding, formerly known as the Palace, in Tiflis-, side by sidewith the Board of Commissioners who represent the officialGovernment.14. The Military authorities therefore have to serve twomasters&apos;, and it is not yet&apos; clear v/hich of the two willeventually gain and keep the upper hand-.   It seems impossiblethat a dual form of Government can last permanently.15. It is also not yet clear whether the TemporaryGovernment has the genuine wish, or the means, to carry on thewar on the Caucasus and Persian fronts in such a manner as toretain
retain the initiative won under the late Commander-in-Chief,and to use it for pushing forward the line now held by theArmies of the Caucasus on the main and subsidiary Caucasusfronts.16. But it is fairly clear that the Council of Soldierarid Labour Deputies is strongly against carrying on what theycall ,Tan aggressive war&quot;, and it is in this question, - thesecond of these above referred to - that the officers of theCaucasus General Staff are now immersed, the militaryeducation of a mass of men who cannot even read and write, theproblem of how to persuade these men that an offensive war iseasier to carry on (given reasonable supplies) than adefensive war.     The task seems at present too great to beperformed with any chance of success, and it is open to questionwhether all the officers of General YudenichTs staff arethemselves convinced of the strength of their oral argument, andwhether some of them are not inclined to swim with the stream.I refer particularly to General BOLKEOVITIHOP.17. General Yudenich has retained his position at thehead of the Army owing to his success in the field andundoubted capacity and popularity.     He has even improved hisposition   but I am personally doubtful whether he Y/ill longcontinue to bear the strain of serving two masters, and therestraint imposed upon him as a Commander.18. But his former Chief of Staff, General BOLKHOYITIIOT,is a much younger man;   he has already shown himself a strongpartisan of the new regime in public and has burned his boats.I believe his amenity to the new conditions to be due tosincere conviction, because he is a man of common sense.     Butthere is no doubt whatsoever that, in his new capacity asDirector General of Supplies and Inspector General ofCommunications, he now realises financial embarrassments andphysical difficulties which never presented themselves to himwhen, as Chief of Staff, it was his comparatively easy duty toformulate
formulate the ideas of the Grand Duke for a campaign and, inconsultation with General YBDSIJIGE, to issue orders for itsexecution.19. General BOlEKHOVITIIOF1 B demarche on the question ofthe feasibility of taking Mosul may be due to this newrealisation of what is involved in the supply and transportof even a small force in barren, difficult country, but hisoptimism on the same question so recently as August, 1916,could not have been based on ignorance of their difficultiesand under the more favourable conditions afforded this yearby close, strong British co-operation in armed force andmaterial supplies of food, his change of view must be partlydue to the military ideas of the Oouncil of Soldier andLabour Deputies and their disinclination for offensivestrategy.20. My brother Officers of the Caucasus General Staffare all young men;   most of them are ambitious and a goodmany of them are by nature and education inclined to followthe easiest line.     Revolutions do not occur often, and itis difficult to ascertain their real feelings on the subject,bpt my present impression is that the Headquarters Staff ofthe Armies of the Caucasus front are overwhelmed with thedifficulties involved in the settlement of the two questionsabove referred to, the internal one of discipline and theinternal and external one of the method of carrying on thewar.     But the Bussian private soldier has performed miraclesbefore this, without supplies, without artillery support,and with worse than useless leaders, and when the new leadersfind their feet he will, I know, astonish you again.   But Ido not expect the miracle to happen for at least three months,* General Bolkhovitinof has already been removed by theSoldiers-1 Committees.
