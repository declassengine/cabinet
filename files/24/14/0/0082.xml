Heads of Inquiry and Summary of Information ,yp to Date.I,   Turkish Peace Moves.The Turkish Government seem to have made up their mind sincethe fall of Bagdad that Turkey cannot hold out many months longeragainst the present military pressure.     They have little hope ofGerman aid - the return of the Turkish forces serving in Europe wasonly secured with the utmost difficulty - and on the other hand, theyare not prepared for the sacrifices necessary if Turkey is to make&amp; separate peace with the Entente.They are therefore concentrating attention now u^on-a., separata-peace between Russia and the Central Alliance.     If they are relievedof the Caucasian front, they appear to think that-they can carry onthe war, even without further German aid, against the British.    Theyare sending all their-reinforcements to Syria, and are reported, toIntend^ a strenuous resistance ^there,-even..at&quot;the,.ris3c of losing moreground in Mesopotamia.On the whole, they expect to hold their owhi if Russia drops -outjor even to recover ground.As regards actual terms of peace, their declared policy is tofight for the retention of Constantinople at all costs and under allconditions.     This was the retort to the Allies&apos; Hote to PresidentNils on on War-Aims, both in the Press and in the Chamber, and it isevidently sincere.     But there are indications that so long asConstantinople remained their seat of Government, they would makeiarge concessions towards the neutralisation of the Straits, evenQlinquishing the military command of them.     Doubtless such con-sssions are primarily material for bargaining and are not equallysincerely
3incerely meant - they have often made agreements about the Straitsbefore and always evaded them.     The effectiveness of the concessionsifould depend upon the international situation after the war.At all events, the main war aim of Turkey is no-? the retention,in some form, of Constantinople.     They seem (since the fall of Bagdad)to accept the certainty of losses on their outlying southern andeastern borders (such losses have been a regular occurrence for twojenturiee), and are prepared to cut their losses in order to extricatethemselves from the war.     The exact amount of sacrifice will naturallyiepend on the e^rse of military operations, and so long as they seemy prospect of Russia making a separate peace, they will not be undulylessimistic as to the extent of sacrifice to be faced.II.   Turkish Internal Politics.Internal politics fall under several sub-heads:-(1)   Cabals within the C.U.P(..There seems to be tension between Enver, who is whole-heartedlyro-Gerrnan and v/ishes to place Turkey&apos;s resources unreservedly atermany&apos;s disposal, and the group centreing round Talaat, whose chiefoncern is to extricate Turkey from the war with the least possible09B.     It is implied that Talaafs faction is gaining ground.(2)   Elimination of Foreign Influences.The C.U.P. has been busily engaged on this since its interventioni the war.    The abolition of the Capitulations, the new customsariff, and the nev/ National Bank   (ultimately to replace the controlleditoman Bank as the State bank of Turkey), are the main achievementsa this direction up to date.     Since the Armenian Deportations, andUll more since America&apos;s breach with Germany, there has also beensteady attack on the American Missions. Colleges and Hospitals,aost the whole Missions   Staff has now left the country, and many[their buildings   have been&quot;requisitionedM.(3) German Penetration.
(3)   German Penetration.This is the reverse side of the elimination of other foreigninfluences.     There has &quot;been a plentiful crop of German societies -commercial, political and educational - for opening up relationsbetween Turkey and Central Europe,     The &quot;Deutsch-Ttfrkische   Vereini-gung&quot; is the most ambitious, and &quot;Austro-Turkish&quot; and &quot;Turco-Hungarian&quot;societies have been founded in imitation.     There are constant reportsof Turks being sent for technical instruction (military, engineeringand agricultural) to Germany, and of German technical commissionsproceeding to Turkey - forestry experts, economic inspectors for eachvilayet, and, most important, a commission on legal/form, which issaid to be insisting on the secularisation of the law of property inthe teeth of opposition from the Ulema.     But Germanyrs chief holdover Turkey consists in the supply of munitions and loans.     WithoutGerman munitions it would be only a question of weeks before Turkeyi70uld have to make peace, and the extent of Turkeyfs financial indebted-ness to Germany was recently revealed in Djavid&apos;s speech to the Chamber.The German press puffs Turco-German relations indefatigably, andincidentally provides a considerable amount of information.(4)   Railways and Harbours.This is really only an item, though the most important one, of(2) ana (3). There are two distinct points here to consider - (a)present construction and (b) plans for the future.     At the presentmoment the Turks are pushing on with the Bagdad Railway, and the rail-Gbead towards the Baza front, to the exclusion of everything else -even pulling up less strategically important lines for the sake of thematerial.     Their policy for the future is to maintain and increasethe German concessions, but to &quot;nationalise&quot; all other foreign enter-prises, especially the Prench railways in Syria and V/estern Anatolia.III.   Hational Movements and their Suppression.There are several subject nationalities in Turkey with a political.organisation
/ -A&quot; 350tyrganisation, and a Prese established in neutral or Entente countries.The most important of these are the Greeks, Armenians, Syriansincluding the diverse interests cf Maronites, Moslems and louses),ad Zionists.     The Ottoman Greeks will fall to the Balkan Sectionore naturally than to/Section E., and on the other hand Turkish/ .-::./ / / / / / / / /ationalism (in its Panturahian and Panislamic forms) ought to beludie&amp; by Section ft. at least as carefully as the movements of theibjcct populations.    &apos; ........The two features in these national movements are (a) theirabitions (promoted in their Press outside the Turkish frontiers) andtheir misfortunes (which happen to them in Turkey itself).     Onthere is usually a superabundance of information; the facts of (b)a always harder to ascertain.     The truth about the Armenian Deporta-ions was learnt almost entirely from returned America^, missionaries,this source of information has now come to an end.     Such factsstill come to light (e.g. the present treatment of the Jews   inlestine), are generally learnt from isolated refugees, and make their&apos;through various channels; if the persecution is sufficientlyrocious, it is taken up by the public press of Entente and neutraluntries, and relief committees in neutral countries often publisheedingly important information from neutral or even from G-ermanurces, in order to obtain sympathy and funds. -^The most important\estions at the moment seem to be (l) the difficulties placed in theth of the Sykes-Pic%, agreement by Zionist protests, S\erifial        \bit ions, and British strategic desiderata;  (2) the presence of Col.emond^s mission at Jeddah; (3) the sudden break in Russian policyvards Persia, which leaves Great Britain with the onus of carryingthe policy of 1907. in face of a Persian Nationalism which is nowankly pro-German. ______________________________  ____._^ ^   j( Political and Economic Agreements (and disagreements)J\       between the Entente Powers.  -&quot;&quot;&quot;^
-r&quot; 351V. British Policy (within the sphere assigned to Great Britain^agreement with the Allies.)The chief thread to follow is the Arab movement supported by theitish Government, which is focussed for the present in (l) the:jaz and (2) Mesopotamia.(l)   In the Mejaz, the Sheriffs ambitions (both spiritual andinrporal) appear to be vague but unlimited, and the British Government,b been careful not to commit itself to anything beyond his sovereigntyd independence in the ftejaz itself.     In spite of this reserve, ourlationa with him are excellent and we retain his confidence - partly,dooKt, on account of his distrust of the Srench.     The definitionhis claims will not become an urgent practical question till therks have evacuated Medina, and though what v/e can give him may fallort of what he desires, there seems no prospect of his treating withs Turks, or, if he did, of their offering him acceptable conditions.(2)     Mesopotamia.     The future status of the Bosra and Bagdadlayets has been the subject of discussions between the War   Cabinetelegram of March 29, 1917), Sir Percy Cox (telegram of April 7), andsViceroy of India (telegram of April 27).     These telegrams areind to be the starting-point of future discussions, and must therefore0the chief guide for-Section S. in the collection of information andservation of the course of events.The two principal decisions arrived at are these:-(a)   The two vilayets are to be administered (under whateverlegal formula) as Arab territories.     The language of governmentis to be Arabic, the personnel Arab, Indians and Anglo-Indianofficials are to be as far as possible excluded, and the localauthorities are to be subject, not to the Government of India, butto the Foreign Office.     That is, the administration of keso-potamia is to be assimilated to the administration of Egypt, andi vAden, the Hadrama^t, the Arabian coast of the Gulf, and all oursphere
sphere of influence in Arabia is to be brought under the sameregime.(b)   A scheme of irrigation is to be carried out in the twovilayets, under a single British control; even if the politicalstatus of the vilayets is dissimilar, the irrigation control is tobe uniform in both.The Viceroy, in his comment on paragraph (8) of the Y/ar Cabinet&apos;slegram, raises the question whether these two decisions are compatibleIf Mesopotamia is to be reserved for the present Arab population,ere will be such a scarcity of man-power that land reclamation mustvery gradual.     The scarcity of man-power appears from -reports **the Arab Bulletin and in Colonel Gribbon*s files - on labour in theera vilayet since the British occupation.     It is also taken foranted by the German economists who have studied the subject that eventhe whole present area of the Ottoman Empire were drawn upon, itlid be impossible to find indigenous man-power for a Mesopotamianrigation -scheme.     Their conclusions are largely based on their ownictical experience in the far smaller Konia and Adana irrigationlemes, which they are at present carrying out.This German point of view is striking, because the Germans haverived at it in the teeth of their own desires.     The last thing they3h to do is to import labour into Mesopotamia from abroad, for theyilise that Mesopotamia is not a &quot;White Man&apos;s Country&quot;, and that anylonists must therefore come, not from Germany, but from Egypt oriia.The Germans accept this necessity, and merely discuss whether itaid be possible to make settlers from British Dependencies subjectTurkish sovereignty, in view of the Capitulations.The Germans do not consider the solution, suggested by the Viceroy,st irrigation might be introduced so gradually that the natural in-case of the population could keep pace with.it.     They assume that anyscheme

They assume that anyscheme
-f-353scheme would have to be on a comprehensive scale, and that it mustbe followed up by an immediate increase in man-power if the capitaloutlay is to bring in satisfactory returns.     This is the view putforward in Sir William Willcocks&apos; Report, which up to the presentis the most authoritative examination of the question from thetechnical point of view.Any detailed report of- this problem would have to be based on(1) tne German literature; (2) the William Willoocks Report andother technical information; (3) reports on existing labour con-ditions in the Arab Bulletin and Colonel Gribbon&apos;s files.VI.     British Relations with Motive Tribes, Chiefs and Govern-merits subject to or bordering on the Ottoman Empire.This is really a corollary to V.The tribes, chiefs and governments with which we are in relations(friendly or hostile) may be divided into the following groups:-(1)   Tho Arabian Peninsula.Hero v/e are taking no direct action ourselves, outside thefortifications of Aden, but are influencing the play of forcesby diplomacy, subsidies, tho-supply of arms and the Blockade.Arabian politics are kalcoidoocopio, but the chief factors and theirtendencies at tho moment cvxi indicated;-(a) The Sharif.     Secure in tho possession of Mekka, and0in the ^/yalty of the Hejaz tribes.     At present wholly occupiedwith tho Turkish forces in Medina.     When the inevitableTurkish evacuation of Medina takes pl.Ace, he will doubtlesslook further afield.     Hio relations with us are excellent.(b) The Idrioi.     Also in revolt against the Turks butjealous of the Shcrif; at odds with him over boundary questions;greedy of territory in all directions., even along the coast ofthe Yemen.     Satisfactory agreement with him over the FarsanIslands, which are to be under his sovereignty with a Britishguarantee.
The Imam.     Attained his authority over the Yemeni tribes by espioning their independence against tho Turks. Since, the war he has come to an understanding with Said Pasha, the Turkish Governor of Yemen, and keeps the local Turkish forces supplied. In return, he has been promised possession of the Hadramant.     Overtures ? been made to us, however, by a group of Yemeni tribes, said to ? headed by one of the Imam&apos;s sons. The Entente with the Turks ? clearly been unpopular with the Yemenis, and as the situation of ? Turks grows worse, it seems that the tribes are turning against ? policy of the Imam.

(d)Ibn Baud.   Represents the Wahabi Dynasty of Er-Riadh. ? the fortunes of his family at their lowest ebb, but has re-?quered his heritage in Nejd, driven the Turks out of El Hasa on ? Gulf Coast (1913), and is now the strongest power in Central? abia. His power is still in the ascendant, and he is a firm ? of ours. His relations with the Sherif are difficult - he ? the same misgivings about the Sherif&apos;s ambitions as the Idrisi ?, though he has not given them the same expression.

(e)Ibn Rashid, of Hail, has lost in proportion as Ibn Saud has gained, and has been reduced from the hegemony of Central Arabia the limits of Jebel Shammer.     He is pro-Turk chiefly because Ibn ? pro-British, and in the earlier stag? of the Mesopotamian campaign he took up a threatening position in the desert on our left ?ank. Our recent advance in Mesopotamia has cut him off from ?kish froces there, but he is still in touch with the Turks at ?, and has 300 Turkish artillerymen at Hail, which makes him against assault in his own capital. His prestige, however ? on the wane; and his own people are turning against him. This necessitates a choice of policy on our part - shall we recognise any ? who overthrows him as ruler of Hail, on condition of his break ? with the Turks, or shall we support Ibn S? claim to the whole ? Nejd, and assist him to make Jebd Shammar his own?

(2) Mesopotamia.












(2)   Mesopotamia.

Here our friendly and hostile relations are both of a more ? to character.

(a) The Sheikh of Mohammera. Nominally a vassal of Persia, ? under British protection. Has everything to gain from ? to us, both politically and commercially,and knows his own ?

(b) The Emir of Koweit. Is under even greater obligations to ? than the Sheikh of Mohammera, for we have championed him successfully against the Turkish claims to his allegiance. The old Sheikh ? just died and has been succeeded by a son, whose character is doubtful, but not his loyalty.

Both those sheikhs are on excellent terms with the Sherif, partly ? of regard for us, partly because they are not his neighbours. Their complacency in accepting his temporal and spiritual claims has occasionally been embarrassing.

(c) The Tribes in the Marshes, (especially on the Shatt-el-Hai) anti-British rather than pro-Turk. Prefer the government which is least aboe to interfere with them, and have the sense to realise that(e are the less desirable claimant in this respect.     Will wait to see which wins, and will acknowledge the winner nominally, in the hope of maintaining the do facto independence they have always enjoyed before. They have called for punitive expeditions already, and there will be 

serious difficulties with them over the question of irrigation.

(d)The Shia Holy Cities (Nejef and Kerbela). Have been sore or less self-governing communities under the Ottoman regime. The religious notables are in closer touch with their co-religionists in Persia and India than with the surrounding populations; they ex? the Turkish troops and officials from, their own precincts a few


few months before we expelled them from Bagdad, and they have given the British a cordial reception. Their attitude is ecclesiastical and unpolitical; they hate Sunni rule, and have no Panislamic regrets for Turkey&apos;s discomfiture. They are an asset to British influence.

(e) Northern Tribes, especially the Milli Kurds of Northern Mesopotamia (along the course of the Bagdad Railway between Djerablus and Nisibiu); the Anazeh allies of the Milli; and  the Anazeh chief who holds the Oasis of Jof (on the communications between Djebel ?hammar and Damascus). All these are still in Turkey&apos;s power, but ? are possible partisans for us in any further advance. The Milli, in particular, bear resentment against the C.U.P. for having broken their power in 1908 (when their notorious leader Ibrahim Pasba mysteriously met his death). One of Ibrahim&apos;s sons has escaped from Turkish prison to Basra, and letters have recently been smuggled through to his tribe.

(3)Abyssinia. The country has been thrown into confusion by ? apostacy of the Negus, ?ij Yassu, to Islam. He set up his ? at Hattar, tried to rally the Moslem Galla and Somali round him, ? apparently hoped to turn Abyssinia into a Moslem State with ?rco-German support. The Abyssians have deposed him and driven ? from Hattar into outlawry. His Galle adherents are still being ?sieged in Magdala. The new government seems, to have the situation ? hand, and we are pursuing a policy of non-intervention. If we ? action, it would be in concert with Italy and France.

(4) North Africa. The Senussi seem to be chastened by the Military defeat we inflicted on them and by tho effects of the blockade? west, the French have had to organise small punitivo expeditions ?, ?adai, and the interior of Algeria. This is in the order the day, and tho present unrest might bo described as sub-normal.

(3) Abyssinia. The country has been thrown into confusion by the apostacy of the Negus, Lij Yassu, to Islam.

The Senussi seem to be chastened by the military defeat we inflicted on them and by the effects of the blockade? west, the French have had to organise small punitive expeditions Morocco, Wadai, and the interior of Algeria. This is in the order the day, and tho present unroot might be described as sub-normal.

(VII). General Political Opinion of Moslems.

Events like the Turkish proclamation of a "Holy War", the insurrection


*&quot;* .*&quot; ^id isurrection of the Sherif of Mekka, and the fall of Bagdad, affect[Q whole Moslem world.     From the British point of view, it is mostiportant to follow the trend of feeling among the Moslems of India.Indian Moslems are depressed by the Turkish situation.     Theysh for a British victory in ethe v/ar, they blame the C.U.P. fortervening in it, and they iregret that the Anglo-Turkish conflictiould ever have arisen.     But that does not reconcile them to thedpwreck of the last independent Moslem Power, which they feel to bepolitical disaster for Islam.A.J.T.20/5/17.
