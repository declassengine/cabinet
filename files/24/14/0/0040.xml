French proposal for the occupation of Greece.Two days ago when the French proposal foroccupying Greece was under consideration the WarCabinet took the view that from a militarystandpoint there v/as much to be said in favour ofthe proposal. I think it desirable therefore tostate the military case afresh, because, as I haveconsistently urged upon the War Cabinet, whatevercan be said for the proposal much more can be saidagainst it. I shall not labour the necessity ofour reducing our Salonika Force, as It is, Iunderstand, now fully accepted by the War Cabinetthat a great reduction must be made. Nor shall Irefer to the diplomatic justification for theinvasion of Greece, That is not&apos; my business. Imust submit however that it will remain impossibleto derive the best advantage from the naval andmilitary forces of the Entente until the Governmentsagree as to their policy, I take it that our policyis to secure a neutral, but friendly, Greece, andthat we have no particular desire to set up arepublic. The French on the other hand are bent onthe occupation of the country, and apparently aredetermined to establish a republic. Unless anduntil a unified policy is decided upon military andnaval effort will continue to be wasted.
I understand that the War Cabinet feel disinclinedto refuse assent to the French proposal, and. contemplateleaving them to carry out the occupation of Greece bytheir own&apos;means and in their own way.   But the proceedingsof the French must re-act upon ourselves, and. therefore Imust tell the War Cabinet what the French proposal mayinvolve.   It appears to be as followsSend one division and some cavalry into Thessaly,Disembark two divisions at and noar Athens.Having secured the country, which the Frenchapparently regard as an easy and rapid operation,to base part of the Allied forces on Greece, butto continue to hold the&apos;present line; to draw inmore Venezelicts as a result of the occupationand thereby set free some of the Allied troops;if compelled later to fall back to do so throughGreece.The chief reason put forward by the French fortheir proposal is that it is necessary to dispose ofGreeco before reducing materially the Allied force atSalonika,   I do not think co.   It has been shown informer Papers submitted to the War Cabinet thatalthough the regular Greek troops in Thessaly, augmented asthey would be by armed bands of reservists andcomitadjis, might constitute a very tiresome and evenserious danger to an Allied Army advancing into Thessaly,these forces would be little better than guerillas,without organisation&apos; or transport, and incapable ofany offensive action outside their own country.As
As regards the hulk of the Greek Amy at present confinedin Peloponnese, the infantry and mountain artillery mightescape across the Isthmus of Corinth, hut it would take along time before they could he concentrated, organised, andprovided with the transport necessary for offensive actionin Macedonia.It is just possible that the 3 divisions detailed forthe occupation of Greece could be made available and thepresent Allied line still be held, but not without incurringgrave risks, as the enemy might in the meantime reinforcethe Macedonian front and launch a heavy attack against theAllied Army.     As to the adequacy of the 3 Divisions Iwould point out that a detachment would be needed to preventthe esoape of the Greek Army from the peloponnese.     Thiswould have to be placed somewhere in the neighbourhood ofMegara, and we have no detailed information enabling us tosay whether this is possible,     Further, after securingAthens and establishing, order in the capital,  it will benecessary to open a line of communication between Athensand Thessaly of about 200 miles in length, running throughdifficult mountainous country,  and provide adequate protect-ion for it.     In view of these extended liabilities itseems doubtful whether the force allotted to the taskwould, be sufficient,  especially when it is remembered thatall the French divisions are greatly below strength.In fact the French proposal is a gamble on the chanceof the collapse of Greek resistance.The
The information in my possession does not lead me to believethat this is a justifiable gamble, and in the event of theFrench forces proving insufficient it would be necessaryto reinforce them.   As it WUBL not be possible to withdrawany more troops from the present Salonika front, thesereinforcements would have to come from the Western front,thus involving locking up still more troops in the Balkansand imposing a still greater strain on shipping and on theNavy.Sven supposing that all went well, it must obviouslytake many months before additional Venezelist troops couldbe raised, organized, and trained so as to permit of Alliedtroops being withdrawn from the Salonika front.It must also be borne in mind that in order to seizeAthens, suppress any rising which may be attempted and, atthe same time, take the necessary measures to prevent theescape of the Greek Army, the two divisions which are toundertake these operations must act in combination and withthe greatest promptitude and despatch.     For this purposethey must be disembarked simultaneously..&apos;    To land them indetachnents would be fatal.   It is extremely doubtful whetherthe necessary shipping could be provided for the simultaneoustransport of a force of this size and in any event it couldnot be assembled rapidly, and therefore immediate action ofthe kind proposed is out of the question.
6, I am not quite clear as to what the French proposeto do if and when they successfully occupy Greece, but ap-p&amp;vently the intention is to hold the present line, and ifeventually compelled to fall back to do so through Greecerather than on Salonika, and in this connection I maynote that Athens is the only really useful base as analternative to Salonika.     Volo is a bad port, and. isconnected with Larissa by a single line of metre gauge.Santi&apos;Quaranta, a place of about 1,000 inhabitants, hasa good harbour but a bad water supply and no port facilities;the available carrying capacity of the Taranto railwayis small and could not be very greatly increased; whilethe fact that the distance by road from Santl Quaranta toMonastir is 160 miles renders of itself this line ofcommi-mication of very little value.     Modern Armies ofhalf a million men cannot be supplied to any appreciableextent by a mountain road 160 miles from their base.7e I wish to warn the War Cabinet that to change thebase of a force of some half a million men is a stupendousand lengthy business.    It is a matter of months; woulddemand a great amount of shipping to effect the transfer; andmeanwhile leave the army in a bad condition to fight,I speak from considerable experience, and may add that itdevolved upon mo, as Quarter-Master-General, to transferthe bases of about 150,000 men from the excellent FrenchChannel ports to St, Nazaire in August 1914.   To transferthe Salonika base to Athens, if compelled to evacuatethe former place, would be an enormous.if not quite imposs-ible task, especially so if the enemy were active - onland and on sea - as no doubt he would be,
lt Shortly put, the net results of the French proposal wouldbe, so far as shipping is concerned, to impose a greatadditional strain on our resources at the outset, while laterit would prove an economy in proportion to the size of theBritish and French forces set free by Venezelist forces.    Itwould, however, be a long time before either the British orFrench troops could be reduced, and therefore the proposaldoes not favourably compare with a withdrawal to Salonikawhich would produce an immediate reduction both in the numberof troops to be maintained and in the shipping required.It must also be noted that the French proposal, so far frominvolving any decrease in our naval commitments, will probablyincrease them, as the Navy will have to provide protectionfor the fresh bases opened in Greece.    It is for the Admiraltyto say whether this strain would or would not be greater thanthat involved by the possible establishment of submarine baseson the coast of Greece if we withdrew to Salonika.9. Thero is another important aspect of the proposal tobe considered.    If the French policy is successfully carriedout, King Constantine deposed, and a Venezelist Governmentestablished at Athens, it is clear that Greece will no longerbe neutral, since Venezelist troops are already engaged inactive hostilities against the Central Powers.   ConsequentlyGreece, under the new regime, will be liable to attack andthe Allies will have the obligation of defending her.   Germanywill not fail to take advantage of this.
25-5-17.To sum up, the French policy is in the nature ofa desperate gamble, and if it fails we shall have anotherenemy in the field and must increase our commitments in theBalkans, while the reinforcements required can only comefrom the Western Front.     At the best it will not, fora long time to come, if ever, reduce our shipping difficultiewhile it may very largely add to them, to say nothing oflocking up troops in a theatre where they can contributenothing to the winning of the war, and at a time v*rhenFrance and ourselves are so short of men.    The War Cabinethave already decided that our troops must be reduced,and therefore I need say no more, except that we arebeing hampered more every day in the despatch of drafts forboth India and Egypt.     For about a month drafts for Indiahave been held up at Durban, while drafts for Egypt havebeen waiting at Marseilles for some vreeks, and the con-gestion there is not likely to be relieved before the middleof June.W.R.ROBERTSONC.I.G.S.
