War Cabinet.Pro-posed Formation of a Jewish Corps.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 8, (ll), Iregret to say that it now seems clear that there is not theslightest chance of Russian and Polish Jews in the East Endof London enlisting voluntarily.     The Director of Recruitinghas received a letter to that effect from Mr Morris Aaron whowas endeavouring to organise a system of voluntary enlistmentfor these men.     The following extract from his letter speaksfor itself&quot;I regret to say that, without exception, I am toldthat it would be a waste of time and effort to attempt therecruitment of these men on any basis of voluntarism&quot;.This bears out ourvexperience in the past.     Eversince June last the Director of. Recruiting has been grantinginterviews and has been in correspondence with prominent Jewsof over military age who have asserted the willingness oftheir compatriots to enlist.     A Jewish Recruiting Committeewas formed.     Special Russo-Jewish Recruiting Sub Areas wereestablished;   all the necessary machinery was set up and muchtime and money were spent but the resulting intake of recruitshas been practically nil.     The enthusiasm of the over ageJew has found no counterpart in the willingness of the Jew ofmilitary age to take up arms for the country of his adoption.Failing some measure of compulsion it seemsperfectly clear that the Army will never obtain the servicesof the Russian and Polish Jews in this Country.     When theMilitary Service (Conventions with Ailied States) Bill becomeslaw and if Russia enters into the agreement now proposed,these men will become available for the Army but not before.DERBY23rd May, 1917.
