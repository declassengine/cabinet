SECRET.-&apos;-WAR CABIHETjC.T. 831.THE RUSSIAN SITUATION MD ITS CONSEQUENCES.(Memorandum prepared in the Secretariat of theWar Cabinet)^   1245In spite of a temporary improvement due to the formation ofthe new Coalition Government the probability remains that Russiawill, for the rest of the war, be more and more absorbed in thedevelopment.of the constitutional and social resolution.     She is,on the whole, not likely to go out of the war altogether.     Buteffective military co-operation on her part can hardly be expected;the most that can reasonably be: counted upon is that she may retaina considerable part of the enemy forces hitherto on the EasternFront.    Even for that degree of&apos; co-operation the section which  orthe moment dominates the situation is demanding from the.Allies, inreturn, a revision of their policy, and the acceptance of terms ofpeace based on principles, which if interpreted literally, wouldrepresent the success of the Central Powers over the whole field enddisaster to the Western Allies, especially to the British Empire.It is always possible that this phase may be a transitoryone.     The new Government may come to realise that its own renuncia-tion of the more ambitious dreams of the old bureaucracy is noreason why its Allies should not insist upon securing territorialor other aims essential to their future safety, and that a victor-ioue Germany remains a danger even to a Russia which no longercovets Constantinople or the Polish provinces of the Central Powers.It may even revert, after an interval, to the old ambitions under anew name, just as Revolutionary France in the name of Libertyrevived all the old aggressive policy of the Bourbons.     On theother hand it is also possible that, a separate peace may be forcedupon the generals at the front by the necessity of suppressingoomplete anarchy or civil war at home.     But the probability isthat Russia will remain a factor, of some usefulness but also ofsome embarrassment, in the war until its conclusion.Political consequences.The outstanding result of the change in RussiaVs positionis that of Germany!s two main projects - the creation of a Middle-Europe extending from Hamburg to the Red   See and Persian Gulf, andthe displacement of the British Empire by a German world domination- the former is practically made good, and, but for accidents,beyond our power to defeat.     We can still reduce this great blockits extremities, by the liberation of Belgium or the conquest ofPalestine and Syria.  . But without Russia we are powerless todispute the settlement of the Polish, Roumanian and Serbian problemsaccording     to the wishes of the Central Powers and within theorbit of their sphere of future economic and military control.
nowftor can we/hope, by any terms that we can offer, todetach any of Germany&apos;s Allies.     We are not prepared to buy offTurkey by surrendering Mesopotamia and deserting the King of theHejaz, and if we did we should have no assurance that Turkey wouldnot resume her alliance with Germany at the close of the war.Our only other bargaining assets arc the German Colonies, and thethreat of a trade boycott.     The former are of no value to Austriaor Bulgaria;    the latter is no serious menace to either of them.    Inany case the very last occasion for deserting an Alliance is whenthat Alliance has justified itself in the field, and promises strengthand security in the future*     Moreover Iliddle-Europe js more than anordinary Alliance.     Geographical continuity, the unifying power ofa great system of railway and river transport, the dominance cfGerman organising ability.and German military and political ideas,have, under the stress of war, welded the whole area into a unitywhich can only be dissevered by sheer force.     And that force is nolonger at our disposal.What is certain, however, is that the diminution of pressurefrom Russia will tend to a relaxation of effort on the part ofGermany&apos;s Allies, and even of Germany herselfc     All the CentralPowers were near the verge of exhaustion when the unforeseen reliefcame.     The longing for peace, held in check by the fear of nationaldestruction, is asserting itself with redoubled force.     The greatmass of the people in the Central Alliance, while resolved to main-tain the unity they have won, will not be prepared to continue thestruggle for objects so remote from their ken as the recovery oflost German Colonies or Turkish pioT/inces, or even the retentionof Antwerp and Zeebrugge.     Moreover, with the diminution ofpressure from without, each of the Central Powers, without ccntem-plating a disruption of the Alliance, will be tempted to showgreater independence of Germany and to play more for its own hand.This is more particularly likely to be the case in Austria wherethe new Emperor and his surroundings are restless under Germandomination, and no doubt hankering,  in true Habsburg style, tosteal any march they can on their Ally.It may conceivably be possible, at a later stage, to makeuse of Austrian particularism in order to improve the terms we cansecure for Serbia and Roumanian and to affect the structure ofMiddle Europe: in a fashion that will make it less formidable foraggressive purposes than it might otherwise have been.   If Austriacan be tempted to consider the possibility of including Serbia andRoumania in a constitutional union with herb^lf, she will be direct-ly interested in offering them reasonable terms, and in recoveringas much as possible of their lost territory from Bulgaria.     Fromour point of view, too, an enlarged Austrian Confederacy, in whichthe non-German elements wsre in a majority, and within which Serbsand Roumanians could aspire to ultimate national union, would be amore effective check nn German domination than a small Austria,with a small Serbia and Roumania each looking to Germany forprotection against Austria and Bulgaria.
- 3 -But whatever the degree of effective domination whichGermany may exert over it. the successful establishment of theMiddle European block on this immense scale increases enormouslythe danger which would threaten the very existence of the BritishEmpire if Germany should be able to recover any of her Colonies(except possibly those in-lest Africa), or if the Turk shouldretain his hold over Palestine.   As naval bases the GermanColonies will be twice as formidable whenits back the resources, not of 70, but ofAnd if East Africa should, by any chance,which, through Turkey, remains in control   , ...tion in Egypt and British East Africa would become one&apos;of theutmost difficulty and danger.the German Uavy has at170 million people,bo restored to a Germanyof Palestine, our posi-Even if we retain East Africa the position will beextremely serious unless Palestine can be secured.   For withoutthe control of Palestine it vail be impossible either to secureeventual railway communication between Egypt and Mesopotamia, orto prevent a&apos; Turkish reoccupation or reabsorption of Arabia, andthe collapse of the whole Arab movement to which our prestige inthe Moslem world is now committed,    -;ith a reorganised German-Turkish ,-,tittj, as a vanguard of the Armies of Central Europe, ina position to strike effectively either at Baghdad or the SuezCanal, and with submarine bases in the Eastern Mediterranean andthe Red Sea, our position both in Mesopotamia and in -Egypt wouldhe increasingly precarious,   The collapse of Russia has, in fact,made Palestine, of the issUos still left undecidod by the war,one of the most vital for the whole future of the BritishEmpire.The Director of Military Operations, to whom these notes have beensubmitted, points out that the Turkish railway communications tothe Northern frontier of Palestine are superior to those on whichthe force defending Palestine would be based, and is inclined tolook upon the retention of Palestine as of doubtful expediency,involving a larger military commitment for its defence than wouldbo involved in the defenco of Egypt at the SI Arish frontier.The argument above does not, however, refor so much to the situa--tion as it would be immediately after tho war as to a future periodwhen one side or the other would have had tine to develop theresources and man oower of Palestine and improve its system ofcommunications.   Prom this point of view it is the belief oi thewriter that Palestine would eventually contribute materially toits own defence as well as to that of Egypt and Arabia,   Thealternative   if the future defence of Palestine were considered tohe likely to imoose an unnecessarily heavy burden for its defence,would be to neutralise it or place it under direct American protec-tion,     In either case the desirability of striking a blow at the?urks in Palestine during this war, and of having as much aspossible of Palestine and Syria in hand at the close of hostilitiesis undisputed.
To insist on this does not mean that the primary import-ance of liberating Belgium and Northern France has been over-looked.    But there are considerations which justify the beliefthat the issue here is really decided already by the conditionsof the case.     The Western Allies, even if they cannot directlyexpel Germany from the occupied region, are too strong to becrushed.    Behind them are the almost inexhaustible reserves ofAmerica.     On this front, at least, hov/ever long she continues,and whatever the cost in men, Germany can no longer extort a deciUh-ion in her favour.    Even if exhaustion on both sides compelleda truoe, the German annexation of these regions would never beacquiesced in either by the Western Powers or by the French orBelgian populations concerned.     Germany has no really sufficientmotive, not even the use of Antwerp and Zeebrugge, which wouldmake the retention of these regions worth the strain, bothexternal and internal, which it would involve.     Germany^ objectson the West have, in fact, throughout been strategical ratherthan territorial.     It was here she struck her first blow whichwas intended to leave her free to dispose of Russia and theBalkans unmolested.     It was here she held on stubbornly whilethe edifice of Central Europe was successively built up in thePolish, Serbian and Roumanian campaigns.Lastly the Allies have in reserve a &quot;threat almost sufficientin itself to secure the restoration of these territories, even ifGermany were really seriously minded to retain them.     That iB theTrade boycott, doubly formidable to Germany now that the UnitedStates have joined the Alliance against her.     This menace meanscomparatively little to Austria, Bulgaria or Turkey, whose productsand manufactures could find sufficient scope within Central Europe,and is consequently valueless as a bargaining esset in eny questionin which these Powers are the parties primarily interested.     Butthe boycott would be a fatal blow to,German industry, and Germanyobviously lives in terror of it.     With a lever so effective asregards Germany in particular, and one direoted to securing thesurrender of an object whose retention is of relatively minorimportance to Germany and of no direct importance to her Allies,the Western Powers should have no difficulty in making good thework of their Armies on the Vfestern Front.Apart from this immediate task of liberation the result ofthe new situation has only been to strengthen the substantialidentity of interests between France and ourselves.     The strongerwe can make France, in Europe, in West Africa, and if possible inSyria, the more effective   she will be as a counterpoise toCentral Europe.    And conversely the practical elimination ofRussia, which may ??ell be a permanent factor after the war, makesthe strength and security of the British Empire far more importantto France than before.     Francs has now a direct interest inour retention of East Africa and of Mesopotamia, and in oursecuring Palestine, which she would not have had if Germany hadteen orushed, or if the Central European block had been brokenin the Balkans or at the Dardanelles.A further result of the establishment of Central Europe isto increase the importance, buth during and after the war, of* til t0 th8 Allisnce-     If Italy were to fall back into theortit of the Central Powers she *would seriously endanger then    &quot;r0n ot Prance not oaly      Europe, but also in Africa whereshe depends on a control of the Western Mediterranean which wouldpe gravely impaired if the Italian Havy and the use of Italy1 sgeographical position were at the disposal of her present enemies.ax is essential to keep in mind that from the point of view bothoLr?Ci&amp;1 reimion and      strategy the prospect of acquiringCorsica and Tunis must always be tempting to Italians, and will
bc doubly tempting if the Allies fail to secure for Italy atany rate the most substantial of her present war aims.     Tokeep Italy in the war to the end, to secure her war aims as faras possible, and to give her reasonable compensation for suchof them as may be impossible  of attainment, either by somecolonial adjustment, if possible, or by a large remission ofindebtedness, should be a primary object of Allied policy.The same is true, on a smaller scale, of Greece.     Theabsorption of the whole of the Balkans and of Turkey in MiddleEurope makes it all the more desirable that Middle Europe shouldnot include Greece, and that the Aegean should not become a Germanlake.     Yfhether the policy which the Allies, led by France, haveactually adopted in Greece has been calculated to promote theobject in view, either during or after the war, may well be opento doubt.     But once adopted it is undoubtedly in the commoninterest that it should succeed and that Greece, whether Independentor under French control, should be outside the domination of theCentral Powers.With regard to Russia the immediate task of the Alliesis one of humouring and persuasion.     It is not a case for anychange in Allied aims or policy in themselves, except in so faras they are necessarily modified by Russia1s military inactivity.For it must be kept in. mind that the situation, and outlook inRussia are hourly   changing, and that is is; equally possible thatno amount of concessions to the &quot;peace without annexations&quot; clamourmay prevent. Russia concluding a separate peace, or that Russiandemocracy may swing back to a policy of ^annexation in the name ofliberty going beyond anything over dteaint of by the old autocracy.But what can only do good is to explain the Allied case.That caso is based on the need for a lasting peace, both bylimiting Germany*s opportunities for aggression and by basing anyterritorial changes that may have to be made upon the free.consentof the people affectod.     This docs not mean, in Buropo, that theAllies are bound to continue the war in order to achieve- aremodelling of Central Europe on Ethnographic lines.     It doesmean that only those conquests, shall be sustained which can bejustified by the consent of the. inhabitants of the territoryaffected.     Outside of Europe there is no territory that we and .Frrnce wish to retain under our control whose retention is notamply justified both by the desire of the inhabitants to befree of German or Turkish oppression, and by imperative consid^r-ations of future peaceful development.     The only Allied claimsinconsistent   with that principle, apart from the abandonedRussian claim to Turkey in Europe, were those of Italy in Dalm^tiaand in Asia Minor, which have, in practice, been superseded bythe courso of events.
This necessity for restating and justifying our policy arises not only from the Russian situation. It is equally essential to make clear to America that the motive for which he wish to eliminate the menace of German naval bases and German-controlled Turkish or negro armies from the neighbourhood of India and the Dominions, is in substance the same as that which underlay her own ?onroe doctrine a century ago. Neither the peaceful development of young free communities, nor the transition from historic autocracy to ordered liberty in an ancient Oriental World like India, are possible in the immediate presence of aggressive militarism, i.e. of power inspired not by the idea of self-development but of conquest.

Even more essential is it that our own people should understand the motive and the necessity which underlie our policy. In the early stages of the war the situation had not shaped itself, nor were the full meaning and possibility of German ultimate aims at our destruction so patent as they have become since the conquest of the Balkans and the development of the submarine campaign. It was enough then to state our policy in general terms as one of the vindication of European liberty and public law, and to demand reparation ? the wrong inflicted by unprovoked aggression. But that is not enough to-day, then it is not only Belgian or Serbian liberty, but British liberty and the very existence of the British Empire which are directly threatened by the great military Empire

? which Germany has built up for herself in the course of the war - a Power whose hand will be simultaneously at our throat in the English Channel and the Suez Canal, unless we can still drive her out of Belgium and Palestine. Hitherto apart from a few official pronouncements of Allied policy in general, discussion of British policy and aims has been left almost entirely to cranks and pacifists. The time has now been reached when a general campaign of education and free discussion is necessary both to guide public opinion and to sustain it through the efforts and sacrifices which still have to be faced.

Military &amp; Naval Consequences.

The direct military and naval consequences of the elimination or paralysis of Russia have already been fully dealt with in memoranda submitted to the War Cabinet by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and by the First Sea Lord. For the purposes of the present paper it will be sufficient to discuss them only in so far as the conclusions to be drawn from them may be affected by the conclusions already drawn with regard to the new political situation created by the effective establishment of Middle Europe.

It is clear from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos;s paper that even in the most unfavourable event the transfer of enemy forces to the Western Front will not put the Germans in a position of superiority sufficient to enable them to break down the Allied resistance, or do more than postpone the turning of the seals till such time as the American Army is due to arrive. And for the purpose of this argument the Italian Front,  which can in an emergency be reinforced by the Allied Armies in France, may be reckoned as part of the Western Front. Whether under these circumstances the object of this, the main campaign of the Allies - namely the breaking down of Germany&apos;s resolution to the point at which she is ready not only to evacuate France and Belgium but in other respects to agree to a tolerable peace - will be most rapidly and most surely attained by the continuance of a wholehearted offensive, or by an active policy of local aggression apart from a general offensive, or even by a generally defensive policy, depends on a number of detailed military considerations. The proportion of losses inflicted to losses incurred in each of these policies, the relative state of the available reserves of man power in each
Wab&amp;-tant country^-th^rp^k^-^^ arrival ofAmerican troops, and a number of similar factors have all to betaken into account.   Broadly speaking the policy decided on must atany rate aim at keeping the German reserves continuously engaged,in order to prevent a repetition at Salonika or in Mesopotamia ofthe unfortunate experience of the Serbian and Stoumanian campaignsof the last two years.   And this object can hardly be achieved by apolicy of inactivity on the Western Front during the coming summermonths.The history of the Salonika Force has been one of successivedisappointments.   It arrived too late to save Serbia or even S^jru-Ls^,Macedonia.   It encouraged Roumania to come in without being strongenough to help her.   It has by hard fighting produced an undoubtedeffect on Bulgarian moral, and if it could have been steadilyreinforced throughout the summer might even conceivably, though notvery probably, have forced Bulgaria to a separate peace.   But thesubmarine campaign has put that contingency out of court.   The onlypurpose of the Salonika Force now is a negative one: to deny Salaakaand the other ports and inlets of Greece to the German and AustrianNavies,and to save Greece from being included in Middle Europe afterthe war.From this point of view it is obvious that an enemy submarinebase at Salonika,though it would have the advantage of being indirect railway communication with the enemy&apos;s centres of industry,would in other respects be less formidable to our shipping in theMediterranean than submarine bases at Volo, in the Gulf of Corinth,or in the Morea.   To protect Greece from German occupation is there-fore more important than to retain Salonika.   Moreover,while theAllied Force,once invested in Salonika,with the enemy in possessionof Greece,would be practically cut off from all hope of relief,itcould always be supplied and reinforced from across the Adriatic as.,long as it held Greecce itself.   It is therefore suggested that ifthe French now succeed sLn their policy of oooupyixig Theaoaly andgetting    Greece under their own and Venizelist control, Alliedstrategy in the Balkans should concentrate on retaining this hold,releasing all troops not actually required for the purpose.   TheAllied front should be first drawn in from the right and eventually,if absolutely necessary,Salonika itself should be abandoned and thefront withdrawn from the Monasiir-Salonika line to the eld Thessalanfrontier,and,in the last resort,to the Thermopylae line,which couldbe held by a relatively insignificant force,and one which it would be-easy to Bupply across the Adriatic through ports on the Gulf.ofCorinth.   If the French policy fails - as it well may,in the absenceof shipping for moving troops by sea from Salonika to Volo or Athens,if the Greeks make any serious resistance - the position of theSalonika Force may become one of the greatest difficulty.There remain the Turkish fronts,i.e, Armenia, Mesopotamia andPalestine.   The diminution of Russian pressure upon the Turks inArmenia is certain to be reflected before long in a Turkish attemptto reconquer Mesopotamia,   The question presents itself whether thedefence of Mesopotamia is best secured by reinforcing the Britishtroops in that region or by a counter offensive through Palestine.The reinforcement of the Baghdad Army beyond a very limited ex-tent is rendered extremely difficult by the immense length (600 miles)and other drawbacks of the line of communication from the PersianGulf,which in its turn is very remote for all supplies or reinforce^ments which have to come from this country.   The climate is also avery serious handicap to the use of British troops.   Nor is there anyreasonable expectation that a reinforced Baghdad Army could, if themilitary situation favoured it, pass from the defensive to any offen-sive that could promise results of great value either from the mili-tary point of view,or from that of future policy,except,indeed,in theevent of a powerful Allied advance from Armenia or through Syria.
On the other hand an advance into Palestine presents many-advantages.     The British force in Egypt has an abundant supplycf labour and a very considerable supply of foodstuffs actuallyon the spot.    While it can get many other supplies throughsubmarine-free waters, it is much nearer to this country forreinforcements and munitions than Mesopotamia, and, obviously,nearer still to Salonika if reinforcements are to be transferredfrom there.     The line of communication which has been establishedacross the desert is comparatively short and its carryingcapacity could easily be increased.     A successful advance wouldnot only secure the use of the enemy&apos;s railway system, but wouldalso, if the submarine danger could be surmounted, afford oppor-tunities for opening up new bases on the coast at places likeHaifa and Beirut, to some extent even at Jaffa.     The Turkishline of communications, on the other hand, is very long, andopen at more than one point to the danger of a landing from thesea. though here again the submarine has possibly put out ofcount projects which otherwise would have offered great strate-gic&amp;l attractions.For the moment, however, the campaign on this front hastome to a standstill at Gaza.    With our Salonika   commitmentsstill unliquidated, neither men nor ships.are available toreinforce Egypt.     And in any case the climate practically rulesout any really vigorous campaign ih Southern Palestine for thenext three months.     But those months need not be wasted.   Itwill be neoessary in the first place to improve the carryingcapacity of the railway by double-tracking it, or at any ratelargely increasing the number of crossings.     Above all it isessential to get together in readiness the shipping and thepatrol vessels required either to provide for an increased forcein Egypt, or to make possible a landing in rear of the Turkishforces.     This may be done, to some small extent, by the directliberation of shipping and naval forces from Salonika, but isreally part of a larger question, the recovery of our strategicmobility oversea.The real purpose of the German submarine campaign has notbeen to starve us.     That possibility may have been held out tocheer the hungry German public, but has probably counted for verylittle in the calculations of those who direct affairs.     Theirexpectation has been to cripple our military effort and that ofour Allies, reckoning on the probability that we should cutdown our supply of necessary materials to our Allies, or curtailour oversea military policy, sooner than face too drastic areduction in our own scale of consumption.     This calculationhas &quot;been largely justified.     One result of the submarine policyis 3een in the Italian coal crisis.     Another is the enforcedreduction of the Salonika Force.     For the moment we have beenreduced to a condition of strategic immobility.     We cannottransfer three or four divisions to a new theatre of war,however important the transfer might be from a military pointof view, because we have not the necessary shipping or pro-tection for that shipping.     To recover our lost strategicliberty &quot;by building up a reserve of shipping available formilitary purposes is the most urgent and probably the mostimportant task before us.     It may be done to some extent byoetter organisation of our shipping routes.     But in the mainit can only be effected, by a drastic reduction of our consump-tion, not only of foodstuffs,- but of every possible importedarticle, and a   corresponding increase of production, so thatwe may have in hand a reserve of these things which would ata^y given moment enable us to release a large part buth of ourships and of our patrols from mercantile to military work, forseveral   months if need be.If this problem is firmly grappled with it ought to bepossible by September, by which time the harvest will, in any
case, prpvide a opnsiderible reserve of supplies in the country,to liberate; enough shipping to make possible the launching of areally effective blow at the Turkish forces in Palestine.     Butthat can only be done if the policy and main plan of operationsin that quarter are decided upon now, and every day in theinterval devoted to pushing on the preparations, and to per-fecting the study of the problem.     On that decision dependsan issue which, so f ajL^s1 the future security of the BritishSapire is concerned, is one of the most important outstandingissues of; the war..&apos;L.S.A.20/5/17 .
