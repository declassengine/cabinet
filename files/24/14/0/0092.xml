,a G.T-89S?AR CABINETTEE WOBLD CRISIS. ^ g 3Memorandum by Sir.&quot; George Paish.Never in their history have Europe in general and GreatBritain in particular had to face a situation 60 grave and so ominousas that confronting-them at this moment.     Following upon the failureof the&quot;ForIdrs crops in the present season and the exhaustion of theForId&apos;s reserves of food another crop failure, is threatened, whichif it is not neutralised in some degree by a. great extension ofacreage in those countries where there is yet time to prepare for agreater production, and by the release of Russiars stores of foodfor the use of other countries, cannot fail to result in a shortageof food next season infinitely greater than the shortage of food willhe this spring.     It is as yet too soon to make, a- close calculationof the amountwof food likely to be available for consumption in thecoming season, nevertheless the existing crop and weather conditionsindicate a deplorably small supply..    M.Boret the President of theFrench Agricultural Committee recently calculated that the amountof wheat&quot;available from abroad for France, her Allies, and neutralsin the next crop year would be less- than two thirds of what they willneed, and it is fast becoming evident that the situation may be worsethan M.Boretb calculated, unless exceptionally favourable weather con- -ditions are now experienced.As matters now stand the Winter Wheat crop of the UnitedStates promises to be so short that the American people may havepractically no wheat for export in the coming season, while Francemay need to import nearly 50 per cent of the Wheat she needs, whereasbefore the war. she needed to import scarcely any wheat except&apos; in badcrop years. *Even if one were to assume favourable weather conditions,in Canada, in Argentina, in Australia and in India, which one cannotdo with safety, as it rarely happens that good weather comes to allthose countries in the same season, it is evident that the World&apos;sfood production will still be very small next season.   And this isthe situation with practically no reserves to be carried forward .from the present crop year!. Hence there is no- room to doubt that the World1s supply offood next season will be exceptionally short, and that food importingcountries -will be nearer to the starvation line than they have beenin modern times.In these circumstances it is evident that the war should,if possible,&apos; be brought to ;an end soon enough to allow the men fromAustralia and New Zealand to return home by the end of August, and topermit an army of. Italian Agricultural labourers to go out to Argentineby September to plough a greatly extended area.Doubtless-you are fully cognisant of the dangerous nature ofthe food outlook for this country,., and I have merely referred to thematter in order to indicate the calamity which may befall almost thewhole nf Europe,&apos; and possibly the greater part of the world, if hos-tilities do not stop soon, and if the human race continues to destroyitself, instead of producing the food essential to its well beino.Providence seems to be warning mankind in the language of nature&quot;thatcannot oe mistaken, that this great and dreadful war has lasted lorgenough, and that without further delay, efforts should be made tobring about a settlement whiehwill be a complete guarantee against &apos;any similar disaster in future,  and will ultimately assure to mankirda aegree of well being greater than has hitherto been regarded as
within the region of the possible.Of course it is needless for me to affirm that itwould be better for the nations to perish from war and star-vation than to submit to the slavery of a military autocracy,and that the war cannot be brought to an end before the princi-ples of freedom for which the world has made, and is makingsuch unprecedented sacrifices are completely vindicated.Can the principles of freedom for which the world isfighting against a military caste be secured without theindefinite continuance of the war? is therefore the question forwhich an answer must at once be sought if a disaster to therace, even greater than the war itself is to be averted.Actual experience alone can give an answer to thisquestion, but so far as the forces making for freedom, and fora peace that will not be broken for many a generation, if ever,can be measured, they unmistakeably indicate that victoryfor the principles for which the Allies are fighting is possiblein the immediate future,What are these powerful forces?The people of Germany and of Austria have greatlysuffered from the severe punishment they have&apos;received at thehands of the Allied Nations for nearly three years, and fromfood shortage for nearly two years, and have only been inducedto endure their sufferings by the constant promisee of an earlypeace.     The dummy peace balloons constantly sent up.by theKaiser are evidently for the purpose of throwing dust in theeyes of the German people as to the real situation and. so induc-ing them to bear their privations for a further period.   Thisyear&apos;s cereal:crops in the enemy countries, however, threatento be very short and the German people are consequently ingreat danger of starvation.The whole hearted and complete adhesion of the UnitedStates to the cause of the Allies cannot fail to have causedthe German people to see things clearly,, and made them realisethat the Allies must win, and that any further sacrifice ontheir part will be, not only fruitless, out harmful to them-selves in a high degree.     In other words they must be fasxrealising that any hope they had of winning the war, or ormaking a peace favourable to themselves has become very slender,and that if they continue the war their future punishment will &quot; ..be exceedingly severe.The Revolution in Russia has completely changed the situationfor the great mass of the German people and has rendered themnot only much less willing to bear the great sacrifices whichthe war imposes upon them, but positively opposed to the con-tinuance of the. war :There can be no doubt that the Kaiser and the Govern-ing classes of Germany used the so called Slav menace as a weaponwith which to fo3oe.the German people to assent to their auto-cratio and military policy, and this weapon has now broken intheir hands.     The German people now realise that the enemiesof Germany were not the Russian people who are giving such clearproof of their love, of freedom both for themselves and forothers, but the autocratic and bureaucratic rulers of Russiawhose relations with the autocrats and bureaucrats of Germanywere so close as to suggest collusion for the purpose of keep-ing the peoples of both countries in a state of subjection.-2-
The anxiety of the German people to get rid of the autocraticand military despotism to which they have hitherto quietlysubmitted in order to avoid what they regard a3 the stillgreater evil of the Russian danger, which is evidenced not onlyby the socialist speeches in the Reichstag, which a short timeago would not have been tolerated, but also by the promises ofelectoral reform after the war which the Kaiser has been pom-belled to give by the ever increasing danger of the internalsituation in Germany,Having regard to these powerful forces all tendingto cause&apos; the German people to threw in their lot with theAllies, what are the reasons that ^itill ^prevent them from ex-pelilng their rulers as the people? have&quot;clone, from making peacewith the Allies, and from being prepared to stand enthusiastic-ally for the principles for whiohthe Allies Nations are fighting?It is evident that several hindrances of great weight stillprevent the German people from acting as the Russian people havedone.One of these is the doubt they still entertain as to whetheror not what they regard as the Slav peril has really evaporated.Every day that passes, however, should remove their doubts aboutthis for the new government in Russia seems to be acting withwisdom and with foresight, and as soon as the democratic Govern-ment In Russia, pursuing a policy of goodwill to all other demoo-racios, is definitely established, the Slav peril should entirelydisappear from the minds of the German people.   In the course ofthe next few weeks this important factor should have great weightwith the German democracy especially If the Russian peoplecomplete the work they have begun in a manner that leaves noshadow of doubt as to its;permanence.Another factor which is preventing the German peoplefrom taking action is their faar that even if they threw overtheir present government, the Allies would still insist onmaking.them responsible!for the indefensible actions of theirpresent rulers? and in order to punish them for the atrocitiescommitted by the German Army and Favy at the command of theKaiser and his Ministers; endeavour to destroy some of theircities, dismember their country by dividing it up into anumber of small States - thus exposing them to unknown disasterin the future - impose a crushing indemnity, handicap theirxoreign commerce to such an extent that they would be unableto buy from abroad the food and raw material they need fortheir&apos; sustenance, and.in f^ot reduce them, the German people,permanently to great poverty.The address of President Wilson to the American Senate,in whioh he was careful to discriminate between the Germanpeople and the Government of the German Empire and toemphasise that America has decided   ,:to fight thus for theultimate peace of the world, for the liberation of its
r386peoples -   the German people Included&quot; has douirtleas-donesomething to remove this fear, &quot;but, inasmuch, as none of theresponsible statesmen of the other nations at war withGermany have yet officially endorsed President Wilson&apos;smessage of freedom to the people of German^, it is evidentthat anxiety for their future, if they were now. to changetheir form of government, is still very great.If the German people are to be won over to theprinciples for which the Allies are fighting, and inducedto disavow their government, its actions and its polioy,and to replace an autocratic by a democratic government,the effect caused by President Wilson&apos;s statement ofAmerica&apos;s attitude towardB them, must be greatly strengthen-ed by an authoritative statement to the same effect by theresponsible statesmen of the Allied Powers,     Indeed everyconsideration that exists, or can be-thought of, renders sucha statement by the responsible statesmen of the Alliednations a mattsr not only of supreme importance, but ofthe greatest urgency.^hat will happen to the whole ,world if the war is notbrought to an end at the earliest moment possible, no onecan predict.   The lb od shortage is already serious, nextspring, even if the war is now &quot;brought to an end, it willbe infinitely more serious, indeed it is evident thatnothing can prevent a most appalling famine throughoutEurope., with loss   /
&apos;of life so great that the mind refuses to contemplate it unless ^the nations at once take collective action to meet the situationsAnd this consideration is over and above the wide spread sufferingcaused &quot;by the loss of millions of the most promising of the youngmen of every great nation in Europe,  and of some of the small onesas well,  the great loss of treasure, and the burdens which will,be imposed by the-war.And what is the authoritative statement that the responsiblestatesmen of the Allied Powers should make having regard to thepresent economic, financial, military and human situation?What statement would be likely to end the war and secureeverything the Allied Nations have fought for,  and hope for?That the Allied nations,  including the United States, areprepared to make peace with the German, Austro-Hungarian,Bulgarian .and Turkish peoples on the following terms -(l)   The Treaty of Peace,  shall be concluded by the Allied.Nations with the peoples of Germany, Austro-Hungary,Bulgaria and Turkey, but not with their rulers,(2)   The peace delegates of Germany,Austro-Kungary, Bulgariaand Turkey shall be appointed by^the Parliaments of thoseStates.(3)    The monarchical and bureaucratic systems of Governmentin Germany, Austro-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey shall bereplaced by systems of democratic and Republican government.(4)   All the nations-now at war shall agree to become membersof a World Council to be formed for the purpose of(a) promoting, maintaining, and enforcing peace betweenall the nations of the World.(b) promoting the freedom of nationalities.(c) festering principles cf international co-operationin all matters which make for the progress of therace,  including matters economic and financial,  and(d) enforcing the observance of international law.(5)   All the nations now at war shall agree to admit to theWorld Council to be formed and convened&apos;&quot; immediately peaceis signed any neutral nation that desires to be.admitted.(6)    The Armies, Kavies and Armaments of each nation shall belimited tv the size necessary to enable the World Councilto preserve the world&apos;s peace by means of the Contributionsin men armaments and money of all the peoples representedon &apos;the Council.(7)   All the nations represented on the Worlds&apos; Council under-take not to engage in trade wars or tariff wars, but topromote international commerce, and to&apos;encourage eachnation to produce those things it has been special^-  adapted by Providence to produce, by permitting the pro-ducts of the nations of the&apos; whole world to be freelyexchanged without the hindrance of protective tariffs,(8)    The armies of the belligerents shall evacuate the .territoriesof each other and of Luxemburg,, certain German coloniesexcepted.- 4 -    -
(9)   The various individual nationalities of Europe shallreceive independence where they form a majority of theinhabitants of any given country or district and desireindependence.(10)   Alsace Lorraine shall he returned to France.(11)   Reunited Poland shall become entirely independent.(13)   The Danish provinces of Germany shall be returned toDenmark,(13)   Bohemia and the adjoining Slav districts of both Germanyand Hungary shall become an independent State.(14)   The Slav districts of Southern Austria and Hungary shallbe added to Servia.(15)   The German-section of Austria shall be. added to Germany.(16)   The Italian Section of Austria shall be- returned to Italy.(17)   The Magyar section of Hungary shall become an independentState.(18)   The Roumanian section of Hungary shall be added toRoumania.(19)   Turkey shall disappear from Europe, and Constantinoplethe Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmora, and the Dardanellestogether with the adjacent territories needed for theirprotection shall be pla,ced under an International Commissionappointed by the World Council,(2$) Constantinople shall be a free port with its 6ivicOontDol entrusted to a Municipal Council after thepattern of Paris.(21) An International Commission appointed by the World Councilshall superintend and organise the work of transformingthe Turkish province of Asia into a modern State with ademocratic Constitution,(22) Armenia shall become independent under the direction ofthe World Council.(85) The damage to property in all countries caused by the warshall be ascertained and due compensation paid to theowners &quot;by means,-of a loan guaranteed as fto both prin-eipal and interest by Germany, Great Britain, FranceItaly, Russia and the United States, the amount ofprincipal and interest to be provided by each of theguarantors to be limited to one sixth of the whole.
(&quot;24)   Provided the German Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian andTurkish peoples emphatically repudiate the action of theirrulers in bringing about the present war in disregardinginternational treaties, and in breaking internationallaws and Conventions during the war, and give tangibleevidence of their detestation of the policy of fright-fulness, which has outraged humanity and has filled theentire civilised world with horror by dismissing theirrulers and by changing their system of governemnt fromautocratic and bureaucratic to democratic,  the otherpeoples who are parties to this treaty will readmit themat once to the Society of nations in the bonds offriendship.- You will realise that the question of indemnity from theGerman and Austro-Hungarian peoples is of no importance in comparisonwith the advantage which the whole world would gain from theenthusiastic adhe sion of the peoples of Germany, Austro-Hungary,Bulgaria and Turkey to the principles for which the Entente nationsare.fighting, and for which they are prepared to give up every-thing they possess - even life itself.   At the present time theEntente powers must be.spending, something like  12,000,000 perdiem upon the war and including the immediate expenditure of theUnited States the total cannot be less than  13,000,000 per day.If the war were continued for only six months longer ( and no onecan predict how long it may last if the Herman and Au3tro-Hungariannations are convinced that they are fighting for their very exist-ence, and that the invasion of their countries by the armies ofthe Entente powers will be attended by terrible reprisals) the costto the Allies&apos;would be about  2,&apos;500,000j 000 and this great sum ofmoney at least would be saved if peace were to be concluded immedi-ately.But it is hot possible to treat the peoples of Germany,  ofAustro-Hungary, of Bulgaria, and of Turkey as both foes and friends.If they are foes then this is net a war for the liberation of thedemocracies of the world from the condition.of servitude and ofoppression in which they have been placed by autocratic andbureaucratic governments, as indicated by President Wilson, and ifit is a war&apos;of liberation then it is not possible to exact anindemnity from the people to whom the Entente powers bring liberty.And behind this conclusion we must not fail to recollect thatthe grim spectre of famine is already casting its shadow over theworld and that to drive away not onlj the shadow but the spectreitself, in the next crop season, will demand all the energies andthe most loyal co-operation of everyone of the belligerents .aswell as of every neutral nation in the world.Again in. matters economic it will not be possible for eachnation to wage a war of trade and of tariff upon a world of friends.It is obvious that hone of the Entente powers could have metsuccessfully the onslaught of the German and Austrian forces byland and by sea without the active and loyal assistance of all theother powers, ana it will not be possible to requite this helpand this friendship with/high protective tariffs designed tobenefit the countries which impose them, at the expenoe of theirfriends.   And it must be remembered that if the German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian&quot; and Turkish people dismiss their rulers andbecome democratic Republics, these nations will also be friendlynations, pledged in future to support those very principles forwhich the Entente. powers have f ought.
- 7 -39Hence it is essential - for the time has come - that them nations of the ,world should adopt towards one another, notonly a new political policy hut a new economic policy also.Just as in political matters, a policy of cooperation mustnowtake-the place of jealousy, so in things economic therelations of the various nations Should be that of membersof one family each seeking to aid the remainder-  and notthat of strangers endeavouring to get and not to give, orseeking to get the better of each other,Without the various nations of the - world havingclearly realised, or for the most.part having noticed thefacts all the nations of the world have nor- become dependentone on the other for. their very moans of existence, andconstitute one family, each member dependent on the othersfor well-being.It is true that the rulers of most of-the nationshave hitherto sought to render their countries &quot;as self-contained as possible by imposing protective tariffs,, ard bydoing many things to impede the free interchange of theWorld&apos;s produce and manufacture, but in spite cf all thebarriers and hinderanees imposed the tide has swept on aidthe value cf the goods interchanged has in the past centuryrisen from a few hundred million pounds to as many thousandmillion pounds notwithstanding the great fall in worldprices compared with the earlier decades of last centurywhich was apparent before the present war.(The value of the world1 s imports in the twelvemonths prior to the war was a Jong way over  4,000,000,000)Indeed the world needs all the produce and all the goodsthat all the nations can grow and manufacture.     The verywell-being of the 7orld is governed by the aggregate amountof the world1 s productions; the greater the production perhead the greater can he the consumption per head.   At presentthe larger part of the populations of the world are underfed,badly clothed, and deplorably housed.     The rulers of the&quot;forld have hitherto thought that the well being of thenations depended upon tho smallness of their consumption,whereas the well being of nations is in direct proportionto the greatness of their consumption;V/hat   the world has suffered from hitherto has been&quot;Deficient consumption&quot; by the great m,;:.ss of the people inall Countries-, not over production, and. the new policy nowdemanded is one that will stimulate consumption and so bringabout a groat expansion of production.       Production over aperiod of years always tends to adjust itself to demand,In brief every barrier that tends to restrict both consumptionand production must be swept away.And how can consumption and production be stimulated?In the first place by a better system of education by whichthe standard of life   ould be raised to a much higher leveland in the second by every notion being induced,, encouraged,and if necessary assisted to produce and to -manufature tho -vthings that nature has designed end intended it to produceand &apos;co make.     Providence has indeed endowed, the world withwealth in such abundance that no one need be hungry, or illclothed or badly howsod,. or local education,  or opportunity ofadvancement.       Ihdedd if all nations,,and all clashes ,enjoyed that high standard of education which is now availablefcr a privileged few, the creation of wealth -rould he soeasy and so great that every one could possess that jjbjie. do viyre which is now unfortunately monopolised by what arcknown as the leisured and cultured classes.
The economic welfare of the family of nsfc ionss ofwhich each and every country is now a member whether con-scions ly or unconsciously would he promoted,not by tradewars nor by protective tariffs but by investigation of theactual in comparison vnth the potential production power cfeach nation,. by an intelligent survey of the power of eaahnation to supply the needs of other nations, and lastly byencouraging and stimulating each nation to pro luce the thingsit can produce most- efficiently and which consequently it isbest fitted to contribute to the world&apos;-&apos;s wealth production..For example it is obvious that Groat Britain shouldproduce milk, for this commodity cannot be transported ov31&quot;seas, also cattle for this goes with the production of milk,also general dairy produce for this goes with milk and cattle,also vegetables of all descriptions for these cannot &quot;be tr&amp;ns-ported over long distances without injury, also coal and ironfor-large deposits of these exist- in various parts of theCountry, also manufactured articles of all kinds and dencrip-tions for the economic and&apos; efficient output of these is governedby cheap power as well as by an e equate supply of iabou; , alsoships, for is not the country an island and compelled do importthe greater part cf - the raw materials it needs for themanufactures which a good supply of fuel and of lab oar enableit to undertake, to the general advantage, as well as a la^gepart of the food needed by its change and ever growingpopulation.Again the willingness of its people to incur risk incarrying on their business renders them specially suitableto undertake the duties of world bankers, underwriters andmerchants.     In other words character and natural conditionsclearly mark out the things which the British people arespecially suited to produce and to do- for ail the world as wellas for themselves.And in a similar way Providence has indicated veryclearly and distinctly the industries and professions that allother Countries can undertake to the great advantage of thewhole race as well as their own well being.If from time to time economic crises occur,  earningsudann and sharp contraction in consumption arrangements /between friendly nations for overcoming them can readily &apos;beeffected., especially now that the world realises that thesecrises arise from temporary and evanescent causes,In recent times world arrangements have been effectedfor dealing with &quot;abnormal conditions in the cotton,, iron andother trades,  so that experience has been already gained ofthe best method of getting through periods of abnormaldepression which in the past were a source of so much anxiety.-As to the proposal that it&apos;isdesirable for GreatBritain to give special ass3.stance to her Colonies to enablethem to complete caccessfulIyVrith Countries similarilysituated - &apos;i&apos;he United States^&apos;Argentine, and Bussia - oneneed only point out that the world-s demand for feed and rawmaterials. will for some years at least &quot;be far greater thanthe supply, and that thereafter given new conditions cffreedom, of equality, of. &quot;opportunity,.and of a much bettersystem of education in all countries, the&apos;demand for foodstuffs -and raw materials is likely to expand very rapidlyand to he fully equal-to if not to exceed the supply.
As matters now stand, such great expansions in thepopulation and wealth Of the Britishi overseas dominions areassured, that they will need no assistance from the MotherCountry other than free markets for their- produce-., and amplesupplies of capital.   Moreover it has to be- remembered that,the &quot;labouring classes of the Mother Country are much lesswell off than their- brothers and sisters in the Colonieswho ha\jo access to almost boundless supplies of virgin- wealfchuNor does the Mother Country Require special help fromher Colonies, for experience has proved that in a world- In,which hi,therta protection has beem ih3 avowed policy of almost,every nation,     (treat Britain has grown so rieSt that she hasbeen kble to finance not only her owsd prodigious way expensesbut something like  1,000;000,000 of the foreign payments of 1her Allies as well, in a period of less than three years.Experience has proved that this welfare has grownwith unexampled rapidity under a system, of taxation; for  .revenue purposes only and not for protection *   If Great BritainIs to maintain an eve.?- expanding population it is evident she mustdo so by expanding her manufactureswhich-in contrast with thevery limited possibilities of her agriculture are capable ofindefinite expansion, and selling them to other Countries inexchange for the ever increasing: quantity of foodstuffs includingfeeding staffs for her cattle,  and of raw material she needs tobuy from abroad.Interchange of the products of Great Britain! forthose of all other Countries is not only essential! but vitalto the continued welfare of the British people,   Supplies offood and raw material for the maintenance of the people ofthis Country must of necessity be drawn  pom the whole world.&quot;The present shortage demonstrates xhis necessity with vaiozc-mglefllforce.     Sufficient food and raw material cannot be prodaoecSin these islands, and regular supplier can only be maintainedby drawing upon the sur^lss productions not only of theCountries within the British Em piro but of every countrythat can produce a surplus.An$f attempt to restrict the area from which, theBritish people draw their supplies of food and raw material,or any measure that discouraged any country frcss producing-the things the British people need, would deal a blow a*i theirwelfare from whic/ii they might never recover, or recover onlywith great difficulty after sucha step had been reteiced.   The&apos; amount of Manufactured goods imported into Great Britain isextraordinarily small,  arid having regard to the fact thatGreat BritainJs welfare is absolutely dependent upon heraoility to manufacture and sell her own manufactured; goodsabroad, rn^st necessarily remain small.     Foreign coal is notsent to Newcastle nor aremanufactured goods sent in anyQuantity to a manufacturing nation unless they are specialitiesof another country and of particular&quot;, value to the manufacturingcountry which imports them.This ifiBaioranduia would become too long and too wearisomeif I were to prove in detail that tho welfare of every othernation now is dependent also in greater or lesser degree uwonthe unrestricted import of the things each
country&apos;is not specially adapted to produce, nevertheless Iwould point . out that the welfare&apos;of every nation will he wonder-fully stimulated when it abandons its fears of foreign- imports,/courageously sets itself to produce the things it is speciallygifted to produce, and buys abroad the things, it cannot produceor manufacture except with relative difficulty and at high cost.All efforts expended upon wasteful production,  that is on pro-duct ion. which can be more effectively undertaken by other nationis a misfortune to the race as tending to restrict the world&apos;saggregate productive power and therefore the quantity.of produceand. of goods available for the consumption of mankind.In the past, nations have not generally pursued the policywhich was best-adapted.for the.advancement of their economicwelfare because of their fears lest they should become toodependent upon, other nations for articles - of&apos;vital importance tothem, but it will now be obvious to everyone that no nation canbe self contained.    The British people if they are to continueto grow in-population and in wealth must import the articleswhich are absolutely vital to them - food and raw materials,  andthe Germans,   the French,   the Italians,,   the Dutch,   the Belgian,the.Scandinavians, the Swiss and other nations are in exactlythe same boat - nations in these days cannot be self containedunless they are retrograde, have no increase in population orno desire to share in the advantages of new inventions whichare so powerfully assisting the world to lead a.higher mentallife, &apos;&apos;and a, less arduous physical existence,., and the sooner thenations recognise this incontestable fact and base their policyupon it,.the sooner will they not only avoid such wars as thisone has been, but they will grow&apos; in well-being beyond the dreamsof the. most optimistic. . Moreover no limit can be placed on thepopulation or -wealth even of the smallest countries that producethings needed by a great many other countries,  and which thelatter desire tc purchase and to consume,  and in turn,  arepermitted -to pay for in their own productions,Of course reasons are sometimes put forward in supportof a so called 11 self contained and protective policy&apos;1 which aremerely,for the purpose&apos; of placing some of the burden of taxationon the shoulders of the masses. .- Thus at- the present time thepeople of Great Britain are being urged- to resort to protectionin order to become self-contained when every instructed personknows they can, never become self-contained try as they may, not &apos;because those who urge protection believe they can become self-contained but because they- do not&apos; see how the country is to paythe interest on its. great war debt,  to meet sinking fund, pay-ments-,   to provide pensions for the wounded and for the friendsof the gallant dead,.to maintain a greater army ana navy thanprior to the war and generally&apos;to meet the greatly increasedcost of government, unless a large amount of revenue is raisedfrom the mass of the people by Indirect taxation,  in the nameof protection and of a self-contained policy&quot;.But-those persons who are.  or rather were, urging thispolicy do not realise what the&apos;effect, of this war will&quot;beupon the British people; otherwise they would not Commend
- ii -indirect taxation accompanied by Colonial Perference, a highertaxation on the produce and goods imported from Allies, astill higher taxation on produce and goods imported fromneutrals, and a yet higher taxation on produce and goodsimported from the enemy countries.   They do not realise thatafter the war food raw material and goods generally will heso scarce and prices so high that the British people willbe prepared fito beg, borrow or steal&quot; from anyone,  or anycountry from whom they can obtain that which will satisfytheir needs, and that to make things- still dearer&apos;by theimposition of the ^reat amount of indirect taxation neededto meet the immense national expenditure now being discussed,Would mean &quot;revolution&quot; pure and simple and that probably.cf the most violent - kind,In the coming years of scarcity resulting from thesrar it is evident that the British people - and for thatmatter the people of all the other food importing statesof Europe - will be in no mood to submit to higher oricesdue to any indirect taxation whatever, and anyone who pro-posed it,  or supported it would be the subject of a popularfury greater than has been witnessed since the FrenchRevolution towards the end cf the eighteenth Gentry.With the close of the present war everything that themind can think of must be done to relieve the necessitiesof the people of Europe in general and of the British peoplein particular and to cause them to act with the greatestpossible moderation under the trying conditions that willthen arise.That you may appreciate that this view is not onethat I have formed hastily I append to this memoranduman article which I wrote for the Statist after visitingGermany in 1912 on considering the probable political?*nd economic effects on the well being of the British andof the German peoples,  of a war between them.   And the actualposition is far worse than I was compelled to indicateat that time, from the evidence then available.
gl2-To increase indirect taxation after the v;ar is over, underthe economic conditions that will, then arise in this country,in France&apos;,&quot; in Italy., in Germany or in other food importingcountries^ will he impossible whether the indirect taxationbe for..-revenue purposes or for protection,     The pressureof necessity will compel the nations to act as they ..shouldhave acted had they been sufficiently enlightened,withoutthe compulsion now placed upon them, by this dreadful war.Tariffs certainly-cannot, under present conditions, beraised, and in food importing countries where agriculturewas protected before the war, they must bo reduced,,Taxation upon imports of necessary manufactured goods willproduce practically no revenue.In,brief, urgent considerations of national well-being - political,.economic and financial - all make forthe destruction of tariff barriers, and are opposed to thetrade wars which have been in some measure responsible forthis world-wide conflict; and will compel the nations toadopt a policy of co-operation, and &quot;of mutual, aid. bywhich the productions of each country will, supplementthose of other nations, and imports&apos; will be regarded withfeelings of pleasure and not of dislike.,If the nations adopt an enlightened policy ofco-operation, and freely interchange their productionswithout imposing restrictive, tariffs either for revenueor &quot;for protective, purposes.., &quot;how will it be .possible forthem&apos;to meet the heavy burdens they are now called uponto bear&quot; for Interest, sinking funds., pensions and defence?The answer to this question is first that theseburdens must, by co-operation, be rendered as light aspossible - pensions excepted     and, second, that theburdens&apos;must be borne by those host able to bear thorn.And what is the first burden that must be borne bythe whole world in mutual&apos; co-operation - ffiMIFEiIf each nation acts In a selfish manner and makesarrangements to ensure to itself its usual quantityof food, without considering the needs of.other nations,nothing can prevent widespread famine /next spring, withall   its baneful anc1 disastrous consequences, throughoutthe greater part of   Europe, including Great Britain,,On the other hand.  if. peace is at once concluded, a WorldCouncil immediately called together to deal with theworld:&apos;s food situation,and the food supplies &quot;of ail thenations are pooled, carefully husbanded and equallydistributed, until the&apos;worid7s food production can berendered adequate, then Starvation on a creat scale willbe averted^This work will admit of no delay*It is too late now for the World Council to doanything to pool the balance of the. world1 s food supplyof this season, which comes to a close in August, butit should have completed its calculations as to the
probable amount of food available for the Y?orld!sconsumption next season by the middle of July and allthe world should be told how much food each person can. consume on the - average day by day throughout the nextcrop season, while as far as possible, steps should betaken-to prevent persons obtaining more than theifspecified share, care being taken to discriminatebetween young childrenj youths and maidens, andadult men and women.In.brief, if the food producing countries onlyexport their surplus productions of food, there willbe insufficient to go roundc     If, however, they willshare and share alike in the matter of food, withthe food consuming nations, then by careful distribution,any serious loss of life may be averted.The next measure for the World Council to considerare the steps that should be at once taken to increasethe world1s productions cf food, and to render themadequate,,     Nothing can be done to increase thepro-duction of food in the Northern Hemisphere beforepreparations- are mado for the crops that will begathered in the later summer. and autumn of 1916, whichwould not bo in time to avert the ,vreat scarcity thatwill bo felt in the Spring of 1918; but there is stilltime greatly to increase the production of food inAustralia and Sew Zealand, in Argentina, Chili, andin India, so that additional quantities of food fromthese countries would become available;in Europe inthe.spring and early summer cf next year.     Hew muchthese countries can produce no one can predict,,Australia is specially liable to drought and aftertwo good crops may sLaszs next year have a bad one.On the other hand, Argentina should have a much bettercrop next year judging by the law of averages.     Incalculating how much food these southern countriescan supply to Europe, it Is essential to be conserva-tive *To get additional   land into cultivation inthese countries,  the Anzacs should be sent home as.quickly as possible, and arrangements should be na de forthe - dispatch of a large quantity of Italian labourto South America, together with the necessary agri-cultural machinery, while the Indian Government should do
all in its power to induce the natives to produce freelyeither by the offer of high prices,, or in any other wajthey deem desirable.- .The third matter that the World Council mustdiscuss is the question of armaments.In no small measure will the burdens  e be borneby the nations in the future be governed by the size oftheir armaments.     Prior to the war the burden of armamentswas a heavy one, and if there is no World Council and noLeague to Enforce Peace in future then it is obvious thatthe World will stagger under burdens it will be difficultfor it W bear.In tills country prior to the war, the expendituresupon defence were  30,000,000 upon the Army/ and   0,000,000upon the Navvy&apos;a total of  30,000,000 a year.The expenditure upon the Army gave us a strikingforce of only 120,000 men.How much would Great Britain need to spend tomaintain an Armf comparable to the Armies of the Continent,which she would be compelled to support if there were noLeague to Enforce Peace?     And how much would she need tospend upon her Navy under the new and greatly changedconditions of Submarine warfare?Merely to state the question as a financial probleiis to suggest its solution.     The world must adept not on!ynew political economic and fiscal policies but a.new militaryand naval ..policy as well -.      H3.ce again co-operation mustbe introduced in place of antagonism.   Indeed co-eperatioimin military and naval matters is the corollary to economic,financial, and political co-operation.A world that follows a policy of brotherhood andof co-operation will need few armamanss.As far as this country is. concerned the matter isvital for we have to recognise that the invention of thesubmarine has jeopardised our power to keep the seas opento our food, cotton, wool, and other ships, and that hence-forward we shall depend for our well being upon the world :tsgood will&apos;as never before.It is obvious that the British people could nabbear a-financial burden for armaments several times greaterthan the burdera they bore before tho war..     Hence from themere question of necessity, leaving, out the more Importantmatter &quot;of human wsll being it is essential that a policy oflimitation of: armaments and of co-operation for mutualdefence must be adopted by all the peoples of the world.There is much, to be said for a policy of totaldisarmament but such a policy at present would create afeeling of insecurity and security.is one of. the strongestforces making for progress.      Therefore if a policy oftotal&apos;disarmament is- ever adopted it must come when theeconomic: and other ties that now bind the nations intoone family become infinitely stronger, which they sill&apos; do.as the .years pass, and when all danger of war- entirelydisappears from the world.The policy which must no-w.be adopted is one thatwill give the world complete security against war- andagainst Its twin sister&apos;famine, which must invariablyaccompany/world wide.wars of any duration in these days.
!3rhis security can alone be gained by the nationsplacing at the disposal of the World Council militaryand naval forces of such power that no nation would evendream of opposing them, a force that potentially wouldconsist of the greater part of the mem of the. entire worldand actually of a percentage of the men of all nations.Moreover it is desirable at this stage that each countryshould maintain, the force it- regards as essential to Itssafety in the event -of any breakdown&apos;of the Leaguie toEnforce -Peace.     Fortunately the countries of Europe nowpossess -fully trained forces of great power- and fullyequipped which they could bring into action again shouldoccasion arise and all they have now to do is to trainto arms a portion cf their young men as they attain maturity:in order to maintain their forces nearly at full strengthfor a number of years to.come.     Practically speaking nearlyevery able bodied man in. Europe, from the ages of 18 to 41is now a trained soldier, and if France, Russia, Italy andGermany were to call to the -Colours eachj year for oneyearJ&apos;s training:, a period which has been proved by&quot; &quot;experienceto be fully adequate, 500,000 young men of 18, these forceswould be maintained at a strength which should cause eachcountry to realise that not only would the forces behindthe World Council be of. overwhelming strengths for the purposeof dealing with any aggresive country, but that each countrywould in itself be strong; for purposes of- defence,    SuchArmies would! enable the.Continental nations to. effectsubstantial reductions in their armament&apos;s expenditures.As for this country, its contribution to the forcesat the disposal of the World1 Council should be naval r&amp;atherthan military,, and this being-the case Its- Army shculdiconsist of only 150,000 young men calied to the Coloursfor one yearJs training, as they attained the age of 18.On the other hand the navy which -Great Britain shouldcontribute to the world5 s police force should be twoships for every ship contributed by any other singlenation whether these ships be battleships, cruisers,torpedo boats, destroyers /
or submarinesc     The basis of naval strength   shouldbe the existing strength cf the British navy and thesums needed to maintain and to renew its existing-strength without further additions to that strengtheither in ships or in guns cr in the calibre of theguns, or in tho range and power of the torpedoes.The United States and Japan, and possibly China,being nations of the first rank,may also be expectedto call to the Colours each year 300,000 young menof 18 for one year!s service and each to provide shipsequal to one half the number, supplied by Great Britain.The other countries of the world, including theSouth American States and British Dominions overseas;may be expected to call to tho Colours each year forone yearrs training, one.half.of all their malecitizens on their attaining 18 years of age, with alimit of 300,000 recruitu per. year per country, andto mako such contribution to the naval forces at thedisposal of the &apos;-7orld Council as would correspondto their, existing naval strength;As.part of the work of effectively controllingthe worldTs armaments and maintaining a force strongenough to deal effectively with any aggressor, the.production of munitions of war, including war ships,cannon, siege artillery, machine gunsj rifles,revolvers and every other.form of weapon, as well asexplosives of every kind and.description shall becomegovernment monopolies in every country,and no privatemanufacture whatever shall be permitted, not evenfor industrial purposes,,     Moreoveri the quantitiesto be produced by each&apos; arsenal, mill,or factoryin any country shall be strictly limited to thequantities approved by; the l?orld Council, and therequirements for industrial purposes shall bedistributed over the various countries on a pro rat abasis governed by tho quantities which such countrieswould bo- expected to contribute by the World Councilin the event of war against an aggressive country.Each country shall duly compensate on.a reasonablebasis, private manufacturers whose works are eXpro-priated or closed by the StaterWere this policy to bs carried out,and no otherseems feasible, without, on the one hand, imposingupon the-race burdens too great to be borne, andbringing- on before- many years are passed anothergreat war, and on the other hand, causing a feelingof insecurity that would be prejudicial to progress,the burden .of, armaments would not be greater thanthe world could easily bear, as the defensive budgetsof European, countries   would either be no greaterthan&apos;they were before the   war or would&apos;be smaller.
The American people alone would need to spend anygreatly increased sum of money upon armaments,but their additional expenditure would be insighi-ficant in comparison with their economic andfinancial strength in comparison with the benefitsto accrue to mankind from the contribution they wouldmake to the work of maintaining the peace of theworld and of securing freedom and justice to thepeoples of the whole earth.Were the defensive policy just outlined tobe adopted by the nations, the pooples of the world .other than the American people would not be burdenedwith any additions to their expenditures for defenceover and. above the outlays they met without muchdifficulty prior to the war;     But they would stillhave to bear the burden of pensions as well as ofinterest and sinking fund on the vast quantity ofdebt created for war purposes.In considering these fresh burdens it is obviousthat everyone, even the poorest, will wish to con-tribute his quota to the sums paid to the widows andchildren of our gallant defenders who gave theirlives to the cause of humanity, as well as to themen permanently Incapacitated by their Injuries,and that the additional taxation placed upon tabacco,tea and other semi-luxuries during the war will bewillingly&apos;continued for this purpose,.and that ifnecessary, assent would be given to the limit ofexemption for incomes assessed to&quot;income tax beingreduced to  2 per week per person, if the income there-from was to be paid to widows, orphans, and the per-manently injuredH    no serious difficulty would, beexperienced in providing for pensions on a fairlyliberal scale.The great difficulty arises in the matter ofinterest and sinking fund on the vast debts thathave been created in this and in other countriesat a time, when it is practically impossible to .increase the burden of taxation, falling upon thegreat mass of the people, by any substantial sum-.. This problem which the British people haveto face, has also to be dealt with by the peoplesof the Other belligerent nations.     In some quartersthe answer given to the problem is that the nationsshould repudiate&quot;their debts as they will find itpractically impossible to provide the necessaryinterest and sinking fund by taxing the great massof the peoples of Europe,   -. However, a little thoughtwill prove this to be the worst possible solution.It would be a breach of faith, and under the newconditions of national and international honour, itis of great moment that the peoples of Europe shouldfulfil all their obligations.It will be well, therefore, to look at the matferin all its bearings and I will examine the situation inthis country *First of all one has to note that the money
401raised by borrowing by the British people for the presentwar up to the end of March 1917- was  3,383,967&quot;,581, andthat if.the war were to be brought to an end at once thedebt would reach about  4,OCO,000,000 taking into accountthe work of diaban&amp;nsnt and assuming it to be accomplishedwithout on-necessary delay.       Of this tot l about 1,000,000,000 will be money lent to allied nations andwhich they m;?.y- be expected, to . repay.    The net debt tobe dealt with would thus be  3,000,000,000 involving anadditional charge for interest of upwards of  160,000,000a year. Of the aggregate war debt of  4,000,000,000rather less than  2,000,000,000 would be funded debt whilesomewhat over  2,000,000,000 would be floating debt. Calling-for repayment or renewal&apos;within the next four years.At- the close of the we? the nation will have toprovide for the repayment or the refunding of approximately 1,000,000,000 of Treasury Bills and Ways and Means Advances.It is obvious that the task of carrying this greatamount cf floating debt will be much more onerous after thewar than it Is during the war.   After the war capital willbe needed for purposes of all kinds and as to the claims ofpatriotism are moon less insistent in peace than in warmany persons will desire to be repaid the money they havelent to the state in order to use ifc in developing theirown business.     Consequ.cn tly preparations mast be madeto repay some portion cf the money/ temporarily lent, tothe State by private per30xis, firms aid companies, andwhich the   State may/ find difficulty/ in refunding.Thus the problem resolves itself into two parts -First    How is the interest to be raised?Second - Row is the debt to be repaid?Hard the debt been raised by the issue of Consuls,repayable only at the option of the Nation and thereforeof indefinite currency, tho Nation might have set up asinking fund or might have refrained from doing- so as itconsidered desirable, but having regard to the fact thatthe whole of the deb-iuhas to be repaid or refunded -and no-one can predict what the future holds - within aperiod of thirty years and a very large portion of it falls tobe repaid within the next four years it is obvious that,large /sinking funds are essential unless the nation decides.to run the risk of default through, inability to repay orrefund from any cause whatsoever.A sinking fund of 1-per cent upon the net war debtof  3,000,,000,000 Involving a charge of  30,000,000,-.&apos;      ayear is the smallest&apos; sum that can be suggested.This means that the interest and sinking- fundupon the net war debt needed immediately the war is overwill be nearly  200000,000.Prior to the war the nation1s expenditures forGovernment were about  209000,000,       a year, and if tothis sum are added the charge&apos;for pensions, as well as theincreased expenditure arising from the adt-ance in prices,and which will still be felt after the war is over, togetherwith interest and sinking fund! on the new war debt, and theincreased cost of education, a total of about  450^000,000is reached.This is assuming there will be no increase whateverin the expenditure on defence in comparison with the outlay prior to the war.This is probably the minimum amount cf the Nation1 sexpenditures for Government after the war.18    *&quot;
I -    *   19   -In view of its greatness no surprise need be feltthat various plans for imposing import duties on foodand raw materials have been put forward under the cloak ofColonial Preference and of protection, and that renewedefforts are being made to prevent the free interchangeof the Worldfs produce   and manufactures even thoughexperience of the past and knowledge of the present proveconclusively that such a course would render the burdensimposed by the war upon this country and upon our alliesstill more onerous, would in a very short time reduceGreat Britain to a second rate power, unable to supportits great population in these small Islands, and wouldput an effectual check upon any further growth of thepopulation of the country.In considering the policy of how this great sumof a minimum net expenditure of  450,000,000 per annumshall be financed when peace Is restored, it is essentialto remember that the country1 s present income from taxationis entirely abnormal.      It is true that in the past yearit reached  573,000,000, but of this a sum of  140,000,000was derived from the excess profits tax, an   Income thatwould entirely disappear within a little over a year afterthe conclusion of peace.      Moreover the general revenuecannot be expected to be nearly as productive after waris concluded and a process of deflation follows upon theperiod of inflation.Owing mainly to the rise in prices and in wages-as. well as to the fact that nearly every person is fullyemployed that can be employed the national income rosefrom some  2,400,000,000 prior to the war to about 3,200,000,000 last year, while at the present time itis probably at the rate of. about  3,600,000,000.Of the growth In the past fiscal year comparedwith the twelve months prior to the war about  400,000,000was in.profit3 and about  400,000,000 in wages.    But afterthe war this great increase In profits anorwages willlargely disappear and what remains of the increase Inwages will be more than needed to -meet the higher cost ofliving due to the scarcity of food, raw textiles, and agreat deficiency In house accommodation and thereforehigh rents.Indeed the real income of the great mass of theworking classes will probably be much lower than it v/asbefore the war owing to the dearness of food and rawtextiles in spite cf some net advance in the rate ofwages.And of course the war profits will entirelydisappear after the war is over.This means that not only will the Income fromexcess profits entirely cease but that the yield of theincome and other taxes and receipts from miscellaneoussources will again become normal or even sub-normal.If one were to take a sanguine view one might be warrantedin looking for a revenue, from the existing taxation ofabout  370,000,000 while should the disturbed state-of&quot;the country in consequence of dearness and short supplyof food lead to the prohibition of alcohol one couldnot anticipate a revenue of not much more than  300,000,000and the latter will probably prove to be the total amountof the revenue likely to be gathered in after taking intoaccount all the factors in the situation - the disbandmentof the army, the scarcity and high cost off food and rawtextiles, the reduction in profits and in wages, and the
probable necessity to introduce prohibition &quot;in orderthat the country may excercise the measure of self controlthat a short supply of food will entail.   And one isconvinced that once the country has had experience ofthe extraordinarily beneftcienteffect of prohibitionit wili never again permit alcohol to be consumed exceptfor medicinal and industrial purposes.To attempt the cover the deficienfcy betweenan expenditure of  450,000,000,       and a pitobable incomeof somewhat over  300,000.000 by means of indirecttaxation imposed on the great mass of the people at thetime they are suffering from a short supply of food,dear living and probably from a considerable measure ofunemployment would be quite impossible.   Indeed if theindications exist of the trend of events over thenext few years are to be relied upon, It would be absolutemadness to try to do so, and would provoke demonstrationsand reprisals cf a character that must be avoided at allcosts.     I would specially refer you to the experienceof the country after the close of the war with Napoleonfor precedent of the probable trend of eventa in thenext few years of food Mortage and unemployment.One realises of course that the painful experienceof the mass of the people of Europe in consequence ofthe Injury to the economic well being of the world- throughthe war, although lt will be greatly reduced by themeasures herein sugg? sted, will still be severe.Nature will compel mankind to do the thingsthat ought to be done as speedily as possible - increase!the world1a food production and supplies of raw textilesby means of a great stream of emigration to the foodproducing countries.

Of this total probably 1,000,000,000 in the aggregate has been obtained abroadby the sale of securities previously owned by Britishinvestors, or by the sale of Treasury Bills, or by thedirect loans made by America to the British people.. . r,t-.    But after the necessary deductions &amp;rtf ^adeBritish investors; bankers,, insurance offices andothers have subscribed no less than  3,000,000,000of new money - (not old accumulations - but new savings,new profits and new Income),   for British loans.   Andbeyond this subscription to Eritish.loans.no Inconsiderablesum of private capital out of current income has beenexpended on the construction of new factories and works,new. houses&apos;, shops etc .   In brief whereas the aggregate-wealth of individual British citizens before the warincreased at the rate of  400,000,000 a year, during thewar It has grown at the rate of upwards of  1,000,000,000a year, and whereas the aggregate accumulated wealth ofindividuals prior to the war leaving Government andMunicipal property out of account wan in the neighbourhoodof  16,000,000,000, It now exceeds  19,000,000,000, whilethe income which these individuals owning this we--alth-will receive in future i. they retain all their wealth,will be at least  160,000,000 per year greater than itwas before the war-.Nor is this the complete story.   The greater partof the additional wealth accumulated by individualsduring the,war.has come directly from the poekets of thepeople and from their exertions, and.only a small portionof it has been accumulated by self denial or by greaterexertions on the part of its present possessors.In financing the war by inflation instead ofby economy, prices of all commodities have been forcedto rise enormously and immense profits have been made .by. the producers.   Thus whereas shipowners In 1914received l/9d per quarter&apos; for transporting wheat fromthe United States to Liverpool they have recently received34/3d per quarter according to the rates quoted in thefreight.market.     It is true that the cost of insuranceis now higher, that wages have somewhat increased, thatcoal is higher, provisions are dearer, nevertheless theadditional profit Is enormous and the people of thiscountry/&apos; are. themselves providing the money..for&apos; the warwhen they buy thSirbread at current high prices.. V... And what applies to shipping applies in anequal measure to farmers, whose profits have enormouslyIncreased in consequence of the high prices, to collieryowners who are subscribing for war stock by charging highprices for their coal, and practically to everyone thathas anything to sell which the nation needs to consume.&apos;- : It should be clearly understood that no blamewhatever can be laid upon the shipowner or the collieryowner, or the millowner, or the farmer or the merchant,or the tradesman charging the market price for theirgoods produce or services when that method of business
is approved by Governments, nor-can they be charged withany lack of patriotism, indeed most of them have workedas they never worked before in order to give the bestservice of ^ihich they were capable to their countries.The, great profits made in all the belligerent countriesby the wealthy have been made with the approval of thevarious Governments who believed that it would be easierto finance the war by a policy of  Inflation than by apolicy o  economy,- not realising that this process wouldmean an Immensely greater consumption than production,a greater demand than supply, the consequent exhaustionof the world&apos;s reserves of commodities of all kinds, thusgreatly increasing the danger of famine, the accumulationof vast wealth by the wealthy classes, and the permanentbenefit of the wealthy classes, at the expense of thewage earning and salaried classes.     In great Britainas matters now stand, the income^assessed to income taxwill be increased by the interest on war debt from about 1,250,000,000 before the war to over  1,400,000,000 afterthe war, whereas the incomes of the wage earning classeswill probably show very little increase, and their realIncomes will be greatly reduced.And what Is true of Great Britain applies ingreater or lesser degree to all the belligerents.In Germany the policy pursued has been infinitelymore detrimental to the great mass of the people than ithas been ih this country.     There wages have not beenraised to any appreciable extent as the cost of livinghas risen, and the Government has financed the war out of thethe huge profits made by        junkers.Manufacturers and.traders, by means of extortionateprices (connived at by the German Government to restrictthe consumption of the masses and to make the food supplylast out).What policy then ought to be pursued havingregard to the fact that the peoples of the variouscountries have really provided by far the greater partOf the money expended upon the war, by means of the.highprices they have paid for commodities, and the hard workthey have done, while the wealthy have received almostthe whole of the war stock issued to finance the war?There is much to be said for a policy ofconscripting wealth^ to the full extent of the war debtsof the various nations so that the aggregate amount ofwealth owned by individuals - and Government debt Iswealth to the individual though&apos;not to the nation -should be no greater at the end of the war than it waswhen war commenced. But it is of the greatestimportance that in the new conditions no?/ arising whenthe peoples of the world will effectively govern the.ii-seives that the policy pursued should be strictly justand that tf error is made it should be on the side ofgenerosity than of Injustice.&apos;  Moreover it should not be forgotten, that theworld cannot progress in material., well being, fasterthan its capital accumulates and its efficiency increases.Education will enable the peoples of the worldto employ the world1s machinery - its capital - withgreater efficiency and therefore will make that machineryof greater value for the purposes of wealth product^.,thereby adding to the general well being, but, addit^uiialmachinery consisting of railways, roads, houses, far...0,factories, docks, harbours, shipping etc.. etc.&apos;must allthe time be supplied, and this can only be done by tujworld being induced to provide the necessary capital
year by year.     Moreover this necessary capital cannot beprovided in adequate amount unless individuals whetherwage earners or &quot;salaried officialsj or employers or ownersof property arc induced to keep their expenditure wellwithin their incomes,  and to employ the margin of incomethey do not expend in adding to the aggregate amount ofthe world1s productive machinery.Having regard to the supreme importance of securingan   adequate supply of new capital for the world day by dayand of maintaining enterprise am    credit,,and to theunwisdom not only of discouraging the accumulation ofcapital, but of failing to encourage the world to makelarge daily savings in order to expand its production andincome in future years, it is desirable that carefuldiscrimination should be made between the enormousaccumulations made, which came during the v/ar from theaccident of high prices or ether&apos; circumstances over whichindividual capitalists had no control and which broughtthem wealth through no effort or self denial of their own,and the ordinary savings of the nation.     In other wordshad there been no war individuals within.the nation wouldhave saved by self denial or in other ways about  400,000,000a year in place of upwards of the  1,000,000,000 a yearInvested in Government loans out of income and of additionalsums expended for productive purposes of one kind or another.In other words about  1,000,000,000 out. of the  3,0.00,000,000invested out of income by British investors in Governmentloans in three years was money that would have been savedhad there been no war while  2,000,000,000   was moneywhich came to individuals by accident and which the peopleof the country are now legitimately and equitably entitledto demand should be returned to the nation for the redempt-ion of a portion of its huge debt.Before deciding upon such a course however, onehas to bear in mind that in years of peace a large partof the wealth accumulated year by year is more or lessaccidental, and due to causes over which individuals haveno control - the weather, crop failures in other countries,new inventions that affect a large number of other industries,such as the introduction of rail?/ays which brought greatwea3th to certain land owners, iron masters and others,the introduction of the motor car which has so greatlybencfitted the rubber industry, the introduction ofelectricity for purposes of all kinds which has so largelyincreased the demand for copper, and so on, and thereforeit would not be quite fair to surcharge persons, whohave by accident como into great wealth in,time of war,and to leave untouched the wealth of persons who by goodfortune came into great possessions by accident in yearsof peace and whose property is now being safeguarded bythe national armies..&apos; Hence instead of requiring only those personswho, by accident have acquired great wealth during thepresent war to return to the nations the greater part ofthe fortunes they have accumulated, the more equitablemethod of obtaining the return to the state of the greatwealth accumulated by Individuals in excess of the sumsnormally saved, is to make an assessment on the entirewealth, of the country with the exception of the wealthowned by individuals possessing fortunes of  1,000 andless and vhich they have probably accumulated by pureself denial.
- S4407Cn the assumption that the aggregate wealth of all theindividuals in the nation on the basis of the prices of securi-ties prior tc the war prices is nor about  19,OCO.OOO,OOO theassessment required to provide  2,000,000,000 would be slightlyever     10 per cent cn the average.And what applies to Great Britain applies in equal orgreater measure to all the belligerents.   In order tc makeprovision for the due payment cf the interest upon, and therepayment of theirwar debts an amount of wealth should beconscripted equal to the sum accumulated by accidental causesduring the war.   After allowing fcr each nations normal rateof saving,  the percentage cf levy being made upon eaoh nationsentire wealth.In the case cf Great Britain this policy would providefor the repayment cf some  2,000,000,000 of debt at maturityand for the. interest on this sum in the meantime, and wouldconsequently reduce the annual expenditure tc be provided forsome years by about  130,000,000 a year from about  450,000,000to about   320,000,000 per annum a sum which would be wellwithin the power of the nation to meet without the impositioncf any indirect taxation&apos;.After prohibition is introduced it may be necessary tcreduce the income tax limit tc  2 per week per person butthis additional taxation rill be easily provided out of thegreatly increased savings of the people arising from the sup-pression cf a drink bill amounting to something like 180,000,000 a year and the wonderfully increased happiness andefficiency of the nation that will result therefrom.This policy would leave the nation with a war debt of 1,000,000,000 or including loans tc allies cf  2,000,000,000and a total debt of about a2,500,000,000 including loans toAllies and the pre war debt in place of  4,500,000,000.In making r. conscription upon wealth in the mannersuggested it is desirable to do so by means of a graduatedlevy,  and I would suggest a levy cf b% on fortunes cf  1,000tc  20,000.10 per cent on  20,001 to  50,000;15 per cent cn  50,001 to  100,000;20 per cnet on  100,001 to  500,000;25 per cent on  500,001 to   &quot;1,000,000.and 30 per cent on sums over  1,000]000;Payments shall be accepted either in cash/ or in securitiesincluding -mortgages, debentures, debenture stock, preferenceshares or ordinary shares-, or in lane or in buiIcings or in-houses,  or in ground rents,  or in any other form of propertycf value.    The total values of the estates should be assessedas for probate and the value cf thi property transferred tothe nation should be in accordance with these assessments.The values of lan   buildings and houses should be thesum placed upon them by&apos; the Land Values Commission&apos;.
The property so transferred should he vested in a depart-: ment of State to &quot;be specially cheated for the purpose ofadministering it and, as opportunity offers, of fee-ting itsrealisation and pcying the income received as well  s thecapital&apos; sums realised to the National Debt Commissioners inorder that the latter may meet the service of the debt andprovide for the redemption of as much of it as the levy onwealth will permit.By this procedure there will be no inter*ference what-ever, with the amount of wealth annually and normally acciumi-lated by individuals and the itr.vicr.-s will mere3.y take backfrom the whole of the wealthy classes the abnormal windfallsthat foil to them during the war.Thus it&apos;will be realised-that it is possible to meetthe greatly increased expenditures of the&quot; nations withoutinflicting grave injustice on the great masses of the peoplesof all the belligerent nations of Hurope. and without makingthem provide huge sums out of their small incomes for interestand sinking funds upon the great war debts that have been createdafter they themselves by their hard work,.. mul self-denial,and the high prices they and the nation have paid, had pro-Tided the owners of the machinery of production with themeans of subscribing for the loans *     Moreover, it will beclearly evident that the imposition of indirect taxation tomsetstha interest and &quot;siiiking- fund on the war debt would notonly be most impolitic in vie grave economic situation intoWhich the world has drifted, but -chat it would be extraordinarilyunjust to the peoples of tho varlotus nations and exceedinglyungenerous   to their gallant soldiers and sailors who havegiven so much for their countries.I would specially point out that by conscripting wealthto pay off the major part of the great1war debts that have beencreated In the last three years, there will be no reductionin the amount of capital now available for carrying on andincreasing the productions of the world,-,     There will hot beone farm or one mill, or one railway, or one ship,the less;all that will happen will be that tho&quot; States will receive largeamounts of money which they will at oaco use for tho redemptionof their floating debts - from the financial point of viewa matter of great moment - and that the money thus paid outto the holders of floating debt will be again devoted by themto capital purposes.It may well happen that the levies upon wealth willin part at tiny rate be paid in treasury Bills, or War Stocks,in which case they would be cancelled and the operation v/ouldbe merely of the nature of a book entry except that the presentowners would give up their right to receive a certain incomefrom the State in future.-while the levy will reduce the wealth of individuals,who so to speak hold mortgages upon the iiita.ro income of thecountry, it-will not in any &quot;&quot;way reduce the&quot;&quot;nationrs capital
immediately available for wealth production.   Possibly butproblematically it mi-.-ht diminish the rate at which capitalwould Increase in future if the ov/ner3 of the conscriptedwealth accumulated a large part of the income they wouldhave received upon that wealth and did not spend it is luxuriousliving , a contingency by no means improbable.Again to the extent of the sinking fund that would beset up to redeem the debt created over a number cf years, thecapital accumulated in future years would be reduced, providedthat the proceeds of the sinking funds were not expended asincome by those persons who received them;   Indeed it ispossible thrt were there no levy on wealth to redeem 2,000,000,000 of debt in this country capital might accumulatehere at the rate of about  500,000,000 a year for the nextfew years instead of at the rate of about  400,000,000 a year,but when one takes into account the worlds&apos; present economicsituation and.the effect of that situation upon the poor inall countries&apos; one is compelled to come to the conclusion thatthe offort to save the extra  100,000,000 a year by placingan extra  100,000,000 of indirect taxation upon the masses,already suf ering from the scarcity and dearness of food,  ofraw material, and of house accommodation might be fraught withsuch serious consequences that not only would the extra 100,000,000 not be^sawgd, but that only a small part of thenormal MOo,000,OOO^put aside for productlm) purposes, &apos; ifindeed there were not a wholesale destruction of property inconsequence of the disturbed condition of the country.And what applies to Greo,t Britain is equally true of othercountries.Every possible consideration of both equity and of sx-pediency shows conclusively that the gre ter part of the wardebts must be liquidated by the wealthyclasse3 whose wealthhas grown, as never before, during the present war, and whohave thus been able to subscribe for almost the whole of thevast war loans that have been issued in all the belligerentcountries.It is possible that the great landowners and great noblesmay wish to hand over to the various states, in part paymentof the lew upon their wealth some of their mansions,  themaintenance of which they claim is an outgo and brings themno income.   These should be accepted in payment at their propervalue as determined by the Land Values Commission in thisCountry and should be subsequentljr sold to the Board of Educa-tion to be used as training colleges.
At the&apos;present time, I understand the owners of countryhouses have patriotically placed them at the service of thenation for the purpose of agricultural instruction or forhospitals.    -It is&quot;equally desirable that in the days to comethe teachers of our young.citizens should bo trained amid .surroundings.that will: enable them to impart- to tho. natioifs. ;children the atmosphere that: cen:alone be gained from contactwith the beautiful in nature and in art,, without which life is &apos;..a sordid thing, and. with which it is attractive beyond measure.If the nation1s citizens are to pc&amp;sess the1 character that can   -alone make and keep a nation greet, the children must be giventhe first place in the nation1o thoughts, raid be surrounded by   vinfluences-;which make life so well worth the&apos;living.     One hasnoted&quot; with&apos;, much   sadness and regret   how few&apos;of the nation1schildren&quot;have hitherto had access, except for an occasionalday,., to. this.     their beautiful country, and one cannot refrainfrom-hoping-.that the day is not far distant when the multitude-of beautiful: parks, and moors spread throughout the country will :be no longer deserted as they now are, while the streets of ourtowns ere crowded by the children of the greet majority cf cur .-.people, but that means will be found of providing for the-children of the whole nation, boarding schools of the style ofWinchester, Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Mar lbo rough, Shrewsbury,.-SClifton, Tonbridge, etc. in all parts of this beautiful, country,in which-, our young citizens can be trained axlidsurroundingswhich.will, subsequently cause thorn to bani3h from the life ofthe&apos;nation&apos;, everything that is ugly aid that tends tc createcfime&apos;,.- disease and misery.And all this will be possible if the   nations&apos;of the worldadopt a- policy, of brotherhood one toward-a the other, end ofco-operation In place of enmity.Providenoo has endowerod the world with wealth beyond .measure and with beauty indescribable.     All that men and women.--&apos;need to do is to seek to live according to the principles now. -accepted as divine by all the world, and thus to enjoy thewonderful end abundant riches of nature which the maker of theWorld, has&apos; placed at their service.IThieh road will the world follow?    The one that leadsto the destruction by war, of the manhood of the nations of Europe,,and- by fomino, to the death of the world1 a children, or tho onethat leads to life higher and   greater - and fuller than the worldhas. yet attained?     Tho one that loads to the continuance of thepresent war and to tho most appalling famine that has ever visitedEurope, to be followed by more wars and greater famines, or theone- -that will&apos;bring peace, not only immediately but possibly forall/time,.. and that will enable mankind&apos;to avert the threatenedfamine1 and all future famines?The. welfare of the human rtce and cf the peoples of Europeand -of Britain-is bound up in the willingness of the British&apos; &quot;people and- of their allies to offer the hand of friendship tethe German people - not to their rulers - and by so doing finallyand- effectually to destroy autocracy and bureaucracy, and withthem their attendant. - militarism;-   and in the mutual desire ofall-nations to inscribe, upon the banner that should float overthe World Council/hot the old death dealing, device of nationaldomination and international jealousy, but the life-giving principle,of EieeuoD.. for: ail peoples, and co-operation and goodwill betweenthe nations. :: .27th.April/1917 (Sgra.)
