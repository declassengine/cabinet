From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,2:Hrd May 1917.(Repeated Cox.)Foreign Secret. Cox&apos;s telegram No. 1612, 13th May. Officers forMesopotamia. I think it probable that, when his telegram issued, Cox hadnot seen my telegram of 10th May emphasising necessity of maintainingseparate administrative systems for Basra and Bagdad. Given this policy,to which His Majesty^ Government attach great importance (I) retention ofKnox as Senior Judicial Officer, Basra, and appointment of Bonham Carterto similar post at Bagdad, can scarcely be regarded as hardship to former,and (2) creation of joint revenue authority as contemplated by Cox does notappear necessary or desirable. Existing revenue arrangements should bereconsidered in this light. Meanwhile I am asking Foreign Office to expediteappointment of Clayton and Bonham Carter, and am applying for juniorofficers from Egypt and Soudan, as desired by Cox.
