WAS CABINET.G.T.830DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATIONIHT1LLIC1ICE BUREAU,weekly REPORT 01 gfrmaiy,i lay 14th to May &quot;Slat 191?.While it is clear that very important movements are takingto get at the real truth.     All that one can say must be at bestuncertain guess work.The debate in the Reichstag on Peace Terms has already beendealt with.     Further information shows that the Chancellor hadnow established some kind of definite agreement with the ModeratePartiesj i.e. part of the Free Conservatives, the national Liberals,the Centre and the Liberal and Radical parties.      This gave himthe necessary parliamentary support which he required again at thecriticism of the Conservatives, end Pan-Germans, while at the sametime it freed him for the present from the inconvenience ofappearing to depend on the Social Democrats.   It was, as spokesmanof these Parties, that the Leader of the Centre gave his support tothe Chancellor*s refusal to state Germany&apos;a peace terms, and inconsequence of this agreement, the Chancellor was able to administera severe reprimand to Scheidemann.The establishment of a central block of this kind is cfcourae a common expedient in German politics, and for the time,it gives special influence to the party of the Centrum.     They are,as always in all matters which do not directly affect theircardinal principles - i.e. Catholic questions - purely opportunist.The Centrum itself is apparently divided on war Questions:     onemotion of it, represented/pla^ce in -Germany and^u stria, it is naturally extremely difficult
- 2 -by the Kolnische Volkszeitung and Brzberger, is violentlyChauvinistic and particularly anti-British;    the majority ofthe party, represented hy Germania. are much more moderate nndprobably in closer agreement with the real wishes of the Chan-oellor than the other party.The Parliamentary situation seems to reflect thepolitical situation.     TSvidence comes from various sources tothe effect that Bavaria and the   Minister President, Count Hert-ling, are taking a prominent part in the negotiations that aregoing on &quot;between Austria and Germany.     There are rumours thatthe settlement of the Polish question and the nomination of aKing of Poland are imminent.     There have been frequent meetingsbetween Count Czernin and Bethmann-Hollweg.     Taken in conjanc-tion with the strong offer made to Russia in the Chancellor&apos;sspeech, if looks as if every effort is being made to get aspeedy settlement *y.f the Polish and kindred questions on lineswhich would moke possible either a separate peace with Russia,or at least, would take the heart out of the war on the Easternfront.     The immediate settlement of the problem of the PolishGovernment is also necessary for other reasons:    in particularthe decision as to the choice of a King in order to counteractthe influence of the revolutionary movement.     To&quot;bring thisabout, the Chancellor is depending on the Centre Party and onBavaria, the Chief Catholic power in Germany, to help in thenegotiations with Austria.At the same time, very favourable reports as to thesuccess of the submarine campaign and (if the fighting on the^:eet are being circulated in the German press.       These are tobe found, not only in Cfm%e,rvat i ve papers, but for instance inthe Frankfurter 2e.itung. from which we may take the followingextract (May 15)  :-
&quot;It is the opinion of all men in authority that ?ahave entered the last phase of the war, and this isthe result of the undreamed of success of the submarine *.whose number and radius of action increase to an alarmingextent&quot;.She German wireless and writers such as Major Moraht, lay stresson very heavy losses of the French and English:-&quot;In less than a month the English have lost 200,000men and gained ground on a stretch of twenty miles fromkens to Bullecourt, which at the greatest depth, is notmore than seven miles.    The British have paid thistremendous price for this small gain of ground which isnot even of tactical importance&quot;.People are taught in fact that the ( German line is quite secureand that as far as the military situation goes, they can lookforward to the future with confidence.     It is only a free-lance,such as Harden, who draws attention to the tremendous importanceof Americans entry in the war and insists that after all thesuccess of Germany is impossible.It looks in fact as if the German Government wereusing every effort to get a settlement with Kussia, and as ifthey hoped, supposing that they attained this, or even supposingthat the Allies feared that they would attain it, that this, andthe pressure of the submarine campaign will be sufficient tobring about some kind of offer of peace by negotiation duringthe ensuing weeks.Attention may be drawn to the article in the Frankfurtergeitoag, quoted in the &quot;Times&quot; of May 2End, in which it issuggested that just as a friendly fooling prevails betweenGermany and Hussia, a similar better will might become feasiblein London and in Paris.     for this it depends on the success ofthe submarine war&quot;According to all the experiences of psychology,It is simply unthinkable that tho brilliant success ofthe German submarines should not promote the peacetendency in England&quot;.We get always the same idea:   if not peace, at least a weakeningof the will to war on the Bast, to be followed by a similar
prooess on the Wes$, which will speedily pave the way to speace by negotiation.     In a peace by negotiation, the GermanGovernment lets it be understood that they would not be founddifficult to deal with, and carefully refrain from endorsing inany way the exaggerated demands which still continue to be putforward by the Pan-Germans.The Beichstag- have now adjourned till the end of June.The Constitutional Committee therefore has also adjourned.   Inthe Committee there were only four representatives of theConservatives as against twenty-four representatives of theLiberal and Central Parties.     As on constitutional questionsthe Centre has tended to go with the Liberals, there has been alarge majority for a revision of the Constitution, and manyresolutions have been passed of a very far reaching nature.This has led to violent protest from the Prussian Conservativesand the representatives of the Government have treated theCommittee with rather marked coolness and reserve.     It is obvious,therefore, that sooner or later a crisis will arise, for thefederated Governments, including the Prussian Government, willhave to take up a position towards these resolutions, and many ofthem are of a nature which it would be difficult for them to accept.It will obviously be their policy to postpone the crisis as long .8 possible.     It will not come up at any rate until the report ofttie Committee is considered in the Heichstag;   this cannot happenbefore the end of June and may be postponed for a considerableperiod longer.22nd.May, 1917.
