dealt with by the Board after the receipt of a report from theCounty Committee.   Where an occupier has hops upon more thanone holding, he will be allowed to count the holdings as onefor the purpose of the RegulationPheasants.Two Orders have been made under Regulation 2R.   By theDestruction of Pheasants Order, 1917 (No.2) the Committees havebeen empowered, where they find that the number of pheasants onany land is likely to cause injury to crops   to authorise theoccupier to kill the pheasants on his land. The previous Order to  similar effect expired on the 3ist March 1917, but it has beenfound that pheasants continue In such numbers as to cause injuryand therefore the present Order has been made without any limit oftime.   Further, owners and shooting tenants have been authorisedto kill pheasants as if there were no close season.By the Pheasants Rearing Order, 1917, the hatching andrearing of pheasants by artificial means is prohibited except underlicence; the power to issue licences being reserved to the Board.Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.The following are instances of specific action:-Bedfordshire - The County Committee have taken possession of variomsmall pieces of land for cultivation or mole drainage:   17 acresand 40 acres at Everton, 18j at Cople, and 20 acres of glebe landat Wilstead.

It is satisfactory to note that the excess of the numberof the applications over the number of plots provided is beingdiminished, the excess having been reduced by 3,705 during thepresent month.HORTICULTURAL SECTIONThe number of Horticultural Representatives is now 302.In several counties a Committee, acting for the whole area, (insome cases, the Local Education Authority and in others, theWomen&apos;s War Agricultural Committee or other body) is undertakingto nominate representatives for the whole county, a course which
will,.it i3 hoped, secure useful horticultural organisation on acounty basis.     During the week 5,520 pamphlets have been distri-butedi     Of these 3,775 pamphlets on vegetable growing have beensent to H.M. Inspectors of Schools for distribution in 1,360elementary schools with gardens attached.

Several Agricultural Executive Committees haverepresented that many urgent demands for soldier labour arebeing received from farmers, and that these cannot be met as nomen are available-.     Requests have been sent to the War Officethat more men should be sent to the Agricultural Company Depotsin these counties.     Reports so far received from DistrictCommissioners do not indicate that generally very active stepsare being taken to bring these Companies up to their fullstrength, and apparently only a small number of men of the RoyalDefence Corps have been substituted so far for men of theseCompanies.WOMEN*S BRAflOH.Threo Group Leaders for part-time workers have beenappointed during the week in Worcester,. E. Kent, and Leicester,but there are still vacancies for leaders in several other
S.counties, some of which the Department hope to be able to fillin the course of a few days. .
