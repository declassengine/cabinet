1Intelligence Bureau,apartment of Information.B\7A/002.B\;p/003.261Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary and Poland.26/5/17.The central event of the week in Austria-Hungary is the resig-ation of the Tisza Cabinet.     Until the very scanty news as yet tohand can be supplemented, and until there is a real clue as to whoare to be Count Tisza1 e successors, it io of courso impossible toenture upon any definite interpretation of the change.     A3 howeverthe Press (with a few rare exceptions) has at once begun to indulgein hasty and often wild generalisations, it may be well to attemptto indicate some of the main factors in the situation.According to reports which have reached Amsterdam (partly viaBerlin) the causes of Tisza!s fall are fourfold:-2.   do. regarding certain points of Central Europeaneconomics.3.   Difficulty with Austria and Germany regarding foodsupplies.4.   Disagreement with the Emperor-King in the matter of theHungarian franchise.1)2)   Poland and kittol-Europa.    It is alleged and seemo to begenerally accepted that according to the latest decision Galicia isto be ceded to the new Kingdom of Poland.     The foremost Hungarianadvocate of such a union is Count Julius An dr assy, Tisza*s personal&quot;Qd hereditary enemy.     Andrasoy upholds it in order to prevent atap- costs the rise of a Polish Irredenta inside the monarchy and1.Disagreement with the settlement reached betweenPorlin and Vienna regarding the Polish Question.brcause
sCause he foresees that should Russian Poland attain independenceItJiout   Austrian Poland being added to it, the Poles would naturallylid, in future conflicts &quot;between Austria   and Russia^ to side withlie latteri     Andrassy Was prepared to pay for Germany*s consent todo union of Austrian and Russian Poland - which Germany considersingerous to herself as the possessor- of PoJen    - with considerableloncessions in the direction of a Central European   Economic union.U April 1916 he published two important articles in this sense irih Frankfurter Zeitung and the ffeue Preie Presse: Count Tisza1sfcss at once replied that Hungary has no direct interest in thejlish. Question and will only tolerate &quot;Mittel-Europa&quot; within certainimits.The&quot;compromise&quot; Polish policy toy which Berlin and Vienna haveeld apart Russian and Austrian Poland has kindled steadily growing[oposition among the Poles of Galicia: and it seems fairly wellstablished that Count Czernin.-acting under their pressure, hasJicceeded in convincing Germany of the necessity of agreeing to suchunion.     The probability is that Germany^ consent has had to beaid for in the way proposed toy Andrassy and rejected toy Tisza.oreover the transference cf Galicia to the new Poland would meanat the new Commercial Ausgleich which Count Tisza has extracted froml^tria after eighteen months1 complicated negotiations, falls ipsolacto to the ground.     Its main icatrarss   are known to toe (l) alifting still more to tho disadvantage of Austria of the relativeinancial burdens (Quota) for Joint Affairs; (2) increased agrarianatics.     Both points, which would toe of great value to the MagyarsM on which Tisza laid great stress as a justification of his policy,ust inevitatoly toe modified if Austria yields up so important anprovince as Galicia with its 8,000,000 inhatoitants.% Tisza, it should toe remembered, though atosolutcly devoted to thepsaian alliance, always consistently held &quot;Mittel-JLuropa,&quot; at arms
th and insisted with all hie might on Hungary&apos;s special economicterests.     Thus though he may be replaced by men who seem less.itified with Germany, none of them is likely to prove in practicefflore efficacious defender of Hungarian interests - economic orherwise - against Germany or even Austria.3)   Pood Disputes.   Though Austria had suffered so severelyring the war, and most of all in her chief agricultural province,licia, Hungary has provided her with even less food supplies thannormal times, and there have been continual and hitter complaintsAustria and also in Germany regarding Hungary&apos;s refusal to shareith her two western Allies.     There is no doubt that Tisza himselfis been largely responsible for this policy, and as the Emperor andpress lose no opportunity of showing their interest and concern inood questions, it&apos;is probably safe to assume that Tisza&apos;6 attitudea this respect has added to the friction between them.4)   Electoral Reform and MagyarJ3ation.   The problem of Franchisecform in Hungary is the axle on which Hungarian internal policy hasevolved .for the last twelve yeaJs and every one both in Austria anda Hungary has long been aware that upon it a solution depends thohole future of the Magyars and indeed of the Dual System and theiabsburg Monarchy ao a whole.     It is not a mere coincidence that theOYcmont   for universal suffrage which first became serious in Hungaryndcr the Russian Revolution of 1905, should have received a freshimpetus from the more complete and successful Revolution of 1917.Prom tho first Count Tisza resolutely opposed any radical^tension of the franchise, alike on theoretical grounds (a3 a con-firmed opponent of modern democracy) and also on the ground that suchw extension would endanger the whole fabric of the &quot;Magyar NationalState&quot; by admitting tho n on-Magyar nationalities - who though relatively^kward arc strongly national in sentiment - to equal politicalri^hts with their hagyar rulers.     This standpoint he has repeatedly
- 4 -piieXd insideand outside Parliament, and Ms bitterest foe must admit(it he has the courage of his opinions.     As recently as 10th May,]j an article under his ov/n name, he urged the advocates of reform tohink well &quot;before the die is cast&quot;, and opposed the view that theranchise aust be given &quot;to those who demand it&quot;.    He added thearning that reform would benefit most the non-Magyar masses, who aremost open to nationalist incitement&quot;.There could, however, be no greater mistake than to imagine thathe substitution of any other prominent Hungarian politician for Tiszaould involve rela**assst towards the non*Magyar nationlities, whetherith regard to the franchise or other matters.     Indeed Count Tisza,ith all his severity, has a distinctly better record as regards-reatment of the non-Magyars than his ohicf rivals of to-day.     Countdrassy, as Minister of the Interior,in the Coalition Cabinet (1906-907) pursued a policy of open Magyarisation, made speeches of greatiolonoc against the non^Magyar   leaders, and was responsible for thetill-born Franchise Reform Bill of 1908, which attempted to nullifyihr grant of universal suffrago by an incredibly complicated system oflural voting.     Count Apponyi, as Minister of Education in the sameoalition Cabinet, was responsible for the two notorious Education Actsi1 1907, which openly aimed at tho forcible Magyarisation of thesnominational schools of Hungary.     Count Aladar Zichy, the clericalleader, though himself more moderate, shares the responsibility of hisolloagucs of the Coaltion Cabinet, as docs Dr. Wekerle, the thenrcmicr, whomsome regard ao the most serious candidate for that post&apos;o-day.     He it was who devised, with the-: late Count Aehrenthal, the*oolutfetsystem in Croatia, the famous Ajjram treason trial, and thepiti-Serbian policy adopted during the annexation of Bosnia.     It was% who publicly revived Hungary13 medieval claims to suzerainty over&apos;o3nia.     Even members of the more radical Karolyi party, like Count^ttliyany and Mr. Hollo&apos; (editor of the- party organ), hold no lc3s
m   5   *extreme views with regard to Magyar domination.     Count Karolyi him-gol-f last December, in Parliament, strongly endorsed the policy of the&quot;Magyar National State&quot;.     In short it would be easy to prove fromspeeches and writings of the leading Magyar politicians of all parties,both before and during the war, that complete unanimity exists amongthem with regard to the need of upholding the political hogemony ofthe Magyars at all costs.Hence it is not the racial question which provides the clue tothe fanatical opposition directed againBt Count Tisza.    Personal andparty animosities play a prominent part.     The hostility of Apponyi,arassy and other leaders of the Constitutional and Independencearties dates back to Tisza1s first Premiership in 1904-1905 , and is11 the more acute because the man whose party succumbed to the on-laught of their coalition was able, when the regime inaugurated byhorn ended in general disillusionment, to return more powerful thanver.     His policy has always been that of &quot;the strong hand&quot;: so farrom meeting his opponents half-way, he has delighted in rousing theirury and provoking the wildest scenes in the Chamber itself.His removal is a guarantee that less autocratic methods will beiopted tov/ards the opposition, but does not foreshadow any changesystem in Hungary itself.    But there are already signs that thoseo have used the franchise question as a lever against Tisza, itsen and honest opponent, will now make every effort to postpone theform until after the war.     In this respect the internal situation ist unlike that of 1905-1906 when the   same opposition leaders usedc cry &quot;Franchise Reform&quot; and &quot;Standing Orders Reform&quot; to upsetsza and then for years evaded their pledges.     At this distance we1 have no real clue to the situation until we know the compositionthe new Cabinet.- Of those named as possible Premiers, Dr. \7ekerle&apos;sfrd has been mentioned above.     He is a Magyarised German from neariesvar and one of Hungary5 s foremost financiers.

His selection would mean a clerioal regime and a eXo-seunderstanding between the head of the Hungarian Government and CountCzernin *as foreign Minister - both men belonging to the same politice.1tendency.The name of the Archduke Joseph has also been mentioned.     Heis the grandson of one of the last holders of the great medievaloffice of Palatine, a popular figure in Hungary before 1848.     Hehas been born and educated in Budapest and speaks Magyar, not German,as his native language.     His candidature might conceivably be inter-reted as an attempt on the part of the opposition leaders to createa dynastic Fronde against his cousin Charles, as a sign of alarmat Charlesrs attempt to further universal suffrage and as an attempto gain the support of a member of the dynasty for the Magyar&quot;National&quot; view. ,   cy ../
