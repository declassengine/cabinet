I submit herewith to the WarCabinet a Memorandum prepared by theRailway Executive Committee dealing withthe shortage of materials for thenecessary repairs and renewals ofPermanent Way, Locomotives, Carriagesand Waggons for use on the Eailways inGreat Britain.   The position as setout in the memorandum is a serious one,and it is imperative that immediateaction should be taken to enable theRailway Companies to obtain thesupplies of materials which theyrequire.A*H.S.30th May, 1917
MSMDRAMDUM W THE RAILWAY EKBCUilTl GO.Shortage of Materials for Repairs and RenewiPermanent Way, Locomotives, Carriages and WageThe Tiailway Executive Committee have to call attentionto the serious position in which the British Railways find them-selves at the present time owing to the want of materials and menwherewith to repair and renew their locomotives, carriages, Wagonsand permanent way.  Unless steps are taken in the immediate futureto remedy the deficiency the position may become perilous.In the early days of the war Lord Kitchener, who wasthen Secretary of State for War, asked that the Railway Companiesshould for a few months reduce their requirements of steel to aminimum and should undertake the manufacture in their workshops of*-various requirements for the Army.    This demand was duly accededto and the Railway Companies were instructed to cease building newcarriages for the time being and to postpone the renewal of loco-motives and permanent way until the position in regard to the oVv-put of material improved.Following on the formation of the Ministry of Munitionsearly in 1915 the supplies to the Railways of the materials noces-sary for the repairs and renewals of their stock and permanent wrywere greatly restricted, and in order that you may be seized of theposition at the present day, it is proposed to take each of tlisfour items, i.e. permanent way, locomotives, carriages and waronsseparately.In a normal year the British Railways require somethingover 200,000 tons of steel rails in order tp enable them to effectthe necessary repairs and renewals of ihei:: running lines.A considerable tonnage of rails &amp;as on hand or undercontract when the war broke out and as a result very little dif-ficulty i?ar experienced during  he latter part of 1914 or in theearly part of 1915.
The supply however soon became exhausted and the Companieshad to reduce their relaying programmes during the latter half of1915,Considerable correspondence passed between this Committee and.the Ministry of itoitions on the subject daring 1915 and 1916* jurf^in November of the first named year the Department fess i&amp;fetosdthat owing to the extent to which relaying had been reduced Init would be necessary that the Bail way Companies should obtainabout 180,000&apos;tons of rails during the year 1916 in order to enable-them to carry out the necessary relaying during that year.But only 60,000 tons were forthcoming in 1916.Towards the end of last year a notification was received fromthe Ministry of Munitions to the effect that no steel would beallocated for rail-making purposes for use in th United Kingdomduring the year 1917.Upon its being pointed out to the Ministry of Munitions thatyif this were adhered to the bulk of the Railways would inevitably,come to a stand through want of new material for relaying pointe\aajdcrossings, an arrangement was made to place the Boiling Millsbelonging^to the London &amp; North Western Railway at Crewe at thedisposal of the Railway Companies generally *  The output of thesemills is about 25,000 tons per annum and is only just sufficientto provide the Railways with material for points aoT crossings.It is not anticipated therefore that any ordinary relayingwillNfeke place during the present year and by the end of 1917 moatof the Companies will be more than 2 years in arrears with;,the workoIt is inevitable that unless rails are forthcoming this yex,r,the speed of trains over certain sections of tbe Main Lines will haveto be restricted^    This will greatly reduce the efficiency of theRailways.  To avoid this, not less than 50r000 tons of Steel Railsover and above the quantity to be rolled at Crewe should be placed
at the disposal of the Railway Companies before the end ofAugust next for use tMs yerarr rThe supply of Sleepers for repairs and relaying is alsovery &quot;bad and steps should be taken to remedy this.   It isrecommended that not less than 1,000,000 sleepers should be -allocated to the Railway Companies and passed to tfcm during tliQnext six months.IQQQMPTiyBS.The total stud of locomotives owned by the Railways inthis Country before the War was approximately 83,000.  Assumingan extreme life of 40 years, it is necessary to replace nearly600 locomotives each year.    For the three years 1914, 1915, 1916only 734 new engines have been put into traffic.   On the othsrhand the British Railways have sent 380 locomotives to France &quot;^nd40 to Egypt and Salonika.During the four months ending April last only 69 newengines have been put into traffic.The Railway Companies are therefore at the present tiiaeshort of no less than 1,600* locomotives and, owing to rant of menand material, there is an increase in the number of engines \l.1ctor-awaiting repair of 1,48&amp; compared with the pre-war period-Here again strong^pressure has been put npon the Ministryof Munitions te secure an increase in material but&apos;all to no;.purpose.A proposal was made by the Ministry of Munitions that the IRailways should use steel instead of copper in the building of newfire boxes.    This was agreed to by most of the Railway Companieson the understanding that the necessary amount of suitable steelwould be forthcoming4,   this has not even materialised.When an undertaking was given to send the 380 locomotivesto France it was distinctly understood that the Companies would bemi in a position to replace them at once and details of all(3) . I- - -:    &apos; v &apos; ii
material required for the purpose were sent to the Ministry ofMunitions.    The details are as followsSteel    12,245  tons.Iron       1,008Corraer       665itsrBrass 50Tin 45A request was also made that certain engines which were on orderwith private firms and some of which were in an advanced statewhen wet broke out should be completed and placed at the disposalof the Railway Companies.    This has not &quot;been done.In addition to the material afore-mentioned a statementwas sent to the Ministry of Munitions in December last asking thatthe following quantities should he allocated for reboilering andrepairs to locomotives during the year 1917;-Material for Reboilering. 1917.Steel Plates, blooms and castings &amp;cIronCopper plates, bars and pipesBrass     ...        ...Copper Boiler Tubes..Brass      &quot;        &quot;Steel      &quot;6,310 tons.?573   51...*..* * t............Material for Locomotive Repairs. 1917.Steel Plates, blooms and castings--&amp;c*Iron ,- 11 u      &quot;       &quot;   -   -Copper plates,bars and pipes.

TheRailway Companies have already had regretfully to decline requestsfor 50 tank engines for Prance and 370 engines for working suppliesbetween Cherbourg and Taranto.
It is impossible for the Railways to find those enginesand at the same time deal with the traffic in this country unlesssteps are at once taken to provide the material referred to endto ensure adequate supplies being forthcoming for the necessaryrepairs and renewals.gARBIAGBStAs previously stated practically no Passenger Coaches haveboon built by or for the Railway Companies during the last 30months.    In ordinary times about 1,500 new coaches would boturned out annually.    It is not proposed to press at the presenttime for material for the purpose of rebuilding.It is -however necossary that the requested amount of mater-ial - steel and timbor - should bo available for repairs andmaintenance.    Particulars have been supplied to the Ministry ofMunitions.The total numbor of Goods,&apos; Mineral, Cattle and Timber Wagonsowned by the Railway Companies in Great Britain at the commence!icntof. the War was about 775,000.   Given an average life of 25 yearsit is necessary to renow 31 ,.000 wagons annually.The number of new wagons put into traffic during 1915 end1916 was less than 29,000 - a shortage of 33,000.At the urgent request of the Government the Railway ExecutiveCommittee agreod at the end of last year to send 20,000 wagons ofvarious types to France.    These have all been sent overseas orare being taken out of traffic for overhaul pending shipment.In addition some thousands of private Owners1 wagons havebeen absorbed for.various reasons and not replaced.It cannot be said that any great.difficulty has beenexperienced in obtaining the necessary material for the repairof wagons, but the same is unfortuaately not so in regard tomaterials for renewals.
In December last we told the Ministry of linitions. thatthe Railway Companies required the following quantities ofsteel and iron for the renewal and maintenance of wagons during1917;-Material for New Wagons. 1917.Steel Plates, blooms &amp; castings, &amp;c. 9,559 tons. *Iron     &quot; w     &quot; .   &quot;        ,! 28,897 tons.Springs and Spring Steel 7,945 tons.Steel tyres     ....        ....        ....        5,405 tons.&quot;   axles     ....        ....        ....       4,967 tons.Wheels, complete..,        ....        ....      29,048 No.Material for Wagon Impairs 1917.Steel Plates, bars, castings &amp;c. 10,683 tons.Iron     &quot;        11 j      &quot;       &quot; 35,770 tons.Springs and Spring Steel 8,624 tons.Steel tyres ....        .....        8,357 tons.&quot;    axles     ....        ....        ....        2,328 tons.Wheels, complete...        ....        ....        3,460 No.A considerable amount of timber is also reguired forthe building of flagons.General.It is evident that certain of the Government Departmentsdo not realise the enormous amount of Work that Railway Com-panies are being called upon to perform at the present time,nor do they appear to appreciate the disaster that may resultfrom a breakdown in the Railway System in this Country.Prom the latest statistics, it appears that notwithstandingthe great reduction in imports, the movement of traffic overthe Railways at the moment is greatly in excess of what it wasin 1913 which was the busiest year the Companies had experiencedprior to the War.
9 C*  ^0 dThis greatly increased traffic is being operated withless locomotives, less wagons and a greatly reduced Staff ofefficient Railwaymen.  Neither the locomotives, wagons, norpermanent way are in as good condition as they ought to he,and the Railway Executive Committee consider it their duty tostate definitely that unless steps are at once taken to meetthe demands of the Railway Companies in the matter of materials,there is the possibility and even the probability of the petitionin this  Country becoming from the traffic working point ofview as bad as it has been in the North of Prance.14th Hay, 1917.(?)
