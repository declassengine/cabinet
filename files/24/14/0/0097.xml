SECRETw  * X897 .WAR CABINET,THE GROWTH OE THE SHOP STEWARD MOVEMENT.Nothing in the history of Labour during the period ofthe Far has &quot;been more remarkable than &quot;the phenomenal rapiditywhich has distinguished the growth in numbers and. in influenceof those local organisations which, first known as Shop Stewards&apos;Committees, then as Workers&apos; Committees, have finally developedinto Strike Committees with a national nucleus in the LondonStrike C ommi11 e e.The Shop Steward, originally and until after the cora-mencement of the war a minor local official subordinate to theDistrict Committee of the Trade Union Executive in certainskilled trades, has a history which extends over more than halfa century.   Provision is made in the registered rules of anumber of Trade Unions for his appointment, his duties,  and hisprivileges.   In clause 5 of rule 13 of the Amalgamated Societyof Engineers it is provided that a District Committee may appointshop stewards who shall be under the direction and control ofthat Committee which shall also define his duties.   These includeperiodical examination of the contribution cards of members ofthe Society employed in the shop,  and a quarterly report to theCommittee on all matters affecting the welfare of the Society.Somewhat similar regulations are included among the rules! of theAssociated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers,  the British Steel&apos;Smelters,  the Toolmakers,  the Smiths and Strikers,  and otherassociationso   It is only since the Far, however, that the shopstewards have organized themselves into bodies REPRESENTING TEEMEN OE SEVERAL UNIONS, instead of being merely%the agents fortheir own unions in the shop.The power of the new organization was first demonstratedby the troubles on the Clyde in the first months of 1916 whichresulted in the deportation of McManusj Kirkwood, and other-members of the Clyde Workers1 Committee.    As a result the movementspread rapidly to other parts of the country, particularly inSheffield, where it was directed by Murphy, Hill and Rayner, who- -were pledged to the idea of COUPLETS CONTROL OE INDUSTRY BY THEWORKERS.   The Sheffield Engineering Shop Stewards&apos; Committee,which they formed, produced the strike in October and November,1916, in connection with the conscription of a man namedKargreaves, and during this strike the system of inter-c ommunica-tion by motor bicycle despatch riders was first introduced.    Thisstrike, though discountenanced by the Trade Union leaders, resultedin a victory for the organisation and was followed by the&apos;strikesat Barrow and Coventry in March and April,  1917.    In the former- case a sympathetic strike at Sheffield was threatened, but th*trouble was settled before it could materialize.    In both cases. agreements wore reached which gave some- recognition to therepresentatives elected by the men in the Shops,  and it is worthremarking that at- Coventry there was no strike during the recentgeneral strike in the Engineering trade, while at Barrow the mendid not come out until after the arrest of the leaders.    It isalso worth pointing out-that.at the Hotchkiss Works, Coventry,it was agreed to establish a representative Works Committee ofShop Stewards elected by secret ballot by the employees, andapproved by the Trade Unions,  with the re suit that NONE 0&apos;^ THEAGITATORS WAS ELECTED OR EVEN NOMINATED.
- 2 -In all the strikes which&apos; have taken place the Workers1Committeeshave endeavoured to obtain recognition for themselvesas against the responsible Executives of their Unions,  and inthe case of the recent strike the local Committees were federatedby means of a-Central Strike Conference in London attended bydolegatea from all parts of the country.    This body claimed torepresent all the strikers and definitely sought to usurp theposition of the Sxecutiyes. -In summing up the general tendencies of the Shop Stewardmovement, two separate causes contributing to its growth haveto be distinguished *    In the first place the crippling of thepower of the Executives by the suspension of the right tostrike by the Munitions Acts has naturally GIVEN THE LOCAL MSHTHEIR OPPORTUNITY to pose as champions of the interests of themen, who have never been enthusiastic over surrendering theprivileges of their trades involved in dilution,  and the otherchanges of practice necessitated by the War.    It is worth notingthat the Shop Stewards movement has only gained any considerablehold in the Engineering trades where, these changes have beenprincipally introduced, and also that although there was nostrike in connection with dilution on Government work,  which wasaccepted by the Executive of the A.S3.,  a strike took placewhen dilution on private work was proposed,  a measure which theExecutive had always resisted.    It is probably true that thestrike would not have   been so extensive,  and the Shoo Stewardswould not have had so united or large a following,  if there hadnot been a general feeling among the rank and file that theywere really acting in accordance with the views of their Execu-tives.   .80 far as the rise of the Shop Stewards is due to theirvoicing the views of the rank and file which can no longer beeffectively championed by the Executive&apos;,  it would be a mistaketo regard the movement as definitely&apos;unconstitutional or aimingat the absorption of the existing Trade Union Organization.:On the other hand,  there has been a second tendency atwork of a definitely syndicalist character WHICH AIMS AT OYJIR-THROWIHS THE EXISTING UNIONS IN THE ENGINEERING TRADE andamalgamating them into an Industrial Union with the object ofcapturing the whole industry for the Workers.    It is allied withthe, &quot;rank and file&quot; movement which had its birth in America,  andfirst took root in this country about nine years ago.    Theexistence of this element is proved by the circular inauguratingthe London Workers&apos; Committee,  which states that &quot;no Committeeshall have Executive power,  all- questions of policy being referredback to the &quot;rank and file&quot;,  and defines its objects as -&quot;1.    To work&apos; for the overthrow of the Wage    systemand the establishment of industrial democracy&apos;.2:.    To obtain an over increasing control over workshopconditions.3.   To regulate the terras upon which workers shall beemployed.4.   To organize the workers on a Class basis ana tomaintain the class struggle until the freedom of theworkers has been gained.&quot;Allied to this element   in the movement is.   the sectionof it which aims at ending.the War and which preaches revolution.Although there is evidence that this section is in close touchwith the Union of Democratic Control and the No Conscription
- 3 -424Fellowship, it would probably be a mistake to regard its influenceon the rank and file as of great importance apart from theindustrial grievances in which they arc interested.    In so faras these, grievances exist,  they are more ready to swallow anygeneral doctrines-which mav be put forward by the Shop Stewards,but. the movement IS IS ITS ESSENCE INDUSTRIAL AND 1T0T POLITICAL,and so far as its industrial objects are attained,  its politicalsignificance will tend to disappear.In other words,  if future trouble is to be avoided it isnecessary(1)   To meet actual grievances which exist, and to preventthe existence of others.(2)   To establish in all --factories a Workshops Committeewhich will fit into the Labour machine withoutdislocating the; existing mechanism.  .As regards (l)  steps are being taken as far-as possibleto do this and further light will no doubt be shed on the subjectby the Commission which is to be appointed.As regards K&apos;?.) the - principle- of giving ventilation totroubles which arise in the Shop and of recognising the electedrepresentatives of the men in the Shop for ^he purpose wouldprobably go far&apos;to diverting the Shop Stewards movement fromdangerous into regular channels, and would act as a valuablesafety valve.-   THE REALLY LEGITIMATE OBJECT OP THE MOVEiSHT isto give the workman some voice in the regulation -of mattersaffecting his employment .   As has been shown,  it is possibleto do this without interfering with the essential functions ofmanagement or with the executive authority of the Trade Unions.Shop Committees have been set up in the National factories,at Armstrong Miitworth&apos;s, Vickers (Barrow)^ and Hotchkiss(Coventry).   The functions and constitution of these Committeesvary, but they are all       alike as being the direct representa-tives of the workers in the Shops,  and as being approved by theTrade Unions concerned.    THEY ARE ALSO ALIKE III ILiVIFG PRODUCED&quot;GOOD - RESULTS,- for not only does- the workman feel that his troubleswill be ,-properly put forward by his rejDresemtatives, but alsoin electing them he will usually be careful to choose responsiblemen -rather than self-seeking agitators.The Ministry of Labour has approached the Engineering andShipbuilding Employers&apos; federations asking them to considerthe question of urging the formation of such Committees,  and itis understood that the Sub-Committee of the ReconstructionCommittee presided over by Mr. whitley, whose Report is now beforethe &quot;Cabinet,  also recommends the formation of Shop Committees.It is felt that this is a matter that ought net to be left untilthe end. of the War,  ana that the time is now ripe for taking itin hand,. Although jt cannot be expected that the present unrest,which is. due to a multiplicity cf causes, will be entirely-allayed by Shop Committees, there is good ground for thinking-that they would do much towards mitigating it.ministry of Labour.31.5.191?.
