If-copySECRET ^-WAR   CABINET.G.T. 827Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.SECTION   D. DBW/006 .WJBEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA.   VI.(May 21 j 1917).To-day and to-morrow are set aside for consideration ofthe Bulgarian Socialist Delegations views at Stockholm.When I wrote my last Report the composition of the Delegationwas not clear:   four Broad Socialists, Sakyzov, Yanulov,Sakarov and Dzhidrov. had already left for Stockholm, the tworemaining members of the Delegation had not been definitelychosen, but the Narrow (pacifist) Socialists had refused toparticipate in a Delegation which their paper described asone which only sought a Governmental peace.     It seemedprobable, therefore, that two other Broad Socialists,Pastukhov and Asen Tsankov, would take these places.   Lateradvices show that the Harrow Socialists have revised theirposition and sent two of their number, Kolarov and Kirkov,to Stockholm.     It is not clear what induced them to modifytheir attitude;   perhaps their change of opinion is connectedwith the permission now accorded by the German Government totheir German Minority Socialists to attend the StockholmConference,It is hard to see what common policy can be decided onby the Broad and Harrow Socialists.     As I showed in my lastReport (Ho. V) the Broad Socialist Delegates regard themselvesas representatives,not only of Bulgarian Socialism, but ofI the Bulgarian nation as a whole, and left for Stockholm afterlong conversations with, and with the full approval of,
- 2 -Badoslavov and the Hungarian Independence leader. CountApponyi.     They announced their intention of championingBulgarian nationalist claims, not only to Macedonia andDobrogea, but also to the Morava valley up to the Austrianfrontier, and are thus clinging to a permanent geographicalconnection with the Central Powers,The Harrow Socialists, on the other hand, have alwaysbeen determined opponents of Bulgaria&apos;a intervention in thewar.    Their outlook is entirely internationalist andpacifist, and they are at daggers drawn with the BroadSocialists, to whom they, in agreement with the majorityof International Socialists in Europe, deny the name ofSocialist at all.... . . &apos;    -The only explanation of the Narrow Socialists1 parti-cipation in the Delegation must be that the German Government,realising the necessity of getting into touch at any costwith the Socialists of Russia have decided to allow a freehand even to the opponents of Central Europe in Bulgariain order to secure, if possible, either a general peace oreven a separate peace for Bulgaria which will leave her inexistence with the greatest possible extension of territory,and so providing in the future convenient means for extendingGerman influence through the Balkans.Till reliable information comes to hand of the attitudetaken up by the Bulgarian Socialists to-day and to-morrow atthe Stockholm Conference, it is impossible to say whetherthere has been any real modification of the chauvinisticattitude of all Bulgarian parties (with the exception ofthe Harrow Socialists).A.W.A.L *
