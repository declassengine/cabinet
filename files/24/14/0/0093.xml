P. Operations.From:-    General BarterTo:-     . C.I.G.S. May 28th 1917,Handed in 12.40 a.m.29th..N0* lc?3.A letter from Prince Leopold of Bavaria has been receivedat G.H.Q.   It was presented cn the Northern Army front by Germanstaff officers.   The letter contains only proposals for peaceor an armistice without my reference to conditions.Alexeieff, I am informed, is not gcing to vouchsafe anyanswer.   A letter was also received a week ago on the southernfront sent by General Rohr to General Swupin, Commanding 9thRussian Army^asking that General Victor von Bauernthal,Ccmmandlng Austrian brigade., might be received as flenipoten-tiary bearing pmposals for peace Or an armistics. This letteralso contained n? mention of conditions and it appears that ithas been decided to ignore altogether.It is the general opinion here that the military situation(?) as regards discipline is improving, certainly In the south-era half cf the Russian line.   The War MinisterJ3 vi3it seemsto have done s^me good, and the definite reply which he gave toGeneral Brusilov on platform at public meeting at Kamenets -Podolsk to the effect that the troops would advance when orderedIs considered satisfactory.Delegates, from the Black Sea Fleet,. -vihioh has behaved sowell throughout the revolution, are doing much good at thefront.   75 delegates are new carrying on most vigorouscampaign on front in favour of energetic offensive and 100more are arriving.   All these sailors have sworn to die fortheir country; 3,000 sailors are also to take part in thefirst attack to set an example.Relations here at G.H-Q. between &quot;the officers and menat the officers conference now being held have today oonsid-erably improved a]the ugh a rupture appeared imminent yester-day (one group undecipherable) as they declared they had nothad a fair hearing..   The officers, it appears, are now willingto&apos;make the desired concessions,   As, however, it is draggingon without getting through much business, it is doubtful ifthis conference can have much influence for good or bad.There is n^ news of importance from any of the fronts.
