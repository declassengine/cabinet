REPORT ON THE VISIT 05* THE LABOUR DELEGATION TO RUSSIA.THE PSTROGRAD WORKMEN^ &amp; SOLDIERS1 COUNCIL.On arriving at Petrograd on 14th April, we got into touchimmediately with the fcrofcisional Government and the Workmenand Soldiers Council.   The Provisional Government received usmostjcordially and made arrangements for us to visit theRussian front.     The ?/orkmen and Soldiers Council ExecutiveCommittee received us at first with a certain amount of reserve&quot;but they were quite courteous, and the discussions we held withthem from time to time were carried on quite amicably.   TheCouncil is composed of various sections of the Sooialist move-ment, the four principal being the two wings of the SocialistDemocratic Party who are the most doctrinaire; the SocialistRevolutionary Party; and the Labour group.    -TH1 COUNCILS PRONOUNCEMENT OK THE WAR.The Executive Committee of the Council were eager toknow the attitude of the British Labour movement towardstheir pronouncement on the aims of the war, and they weremost anxious that we should use our influence with theBritish Labour Party in order that the British Governmentmight ,be induced to endorse the pronouncement.   We pointed outto the Committee that the attitude of the British Labour andSocialist movement as a whole had been expressed in resolutionspassed at the various annual conferences of the British LabourParty, the Trade Union Congress and the General Federation ofTrade Unions, and that we represented the views expressed bythe majority of the delegates at these conferences.PEACE FORMULA.We discussed, however, at considerable length onseveral occasions with the Committee, the terms of thepronouncement and pointed out that the simplicity of theformula of &quot;No annexation and no indemnities&quot; rendered itineffective as a statement of Allied aims.   We asked whetherthe transference to France of Alsace Lorraine for instance,would be considered to be an annexation, and whether insistencenpon payment from Germany for damage done in Belgium, NorthernFrance, Poland and elsewhere ?/ould be considered to be a demandfor indemnity.    We also suggested that the third clause inthe pronouncement,- &quot;the right of any nationality to settle itsown destiny&quot;,- would probably lead to a transference of terri-tory and people from one Power to another and such transferencemight be considered to be annexation.   The Committee could notgive a.clear and definite interpretation of the phrase &quot;Noannexation and no indemnities&quot;; but they agreed that trans-ference of territories and peoples must take place and thatthe damage to Belgium, Northern France, Serbia, etc., must be  *paid for.     In reply to a direct question which I put, theCommittee repudiated the idea that they were in favour of thestatus quo ante bellum.   They wer$ however, most anxious thatthe three clauses in their pronouncement should be adopted bythe Allies in principle, leaving discussion of details to thePeace/S e q R E T. *G.Ti 858 *
Peace Conference whenever it meets,   Our last meeting withthe Wbr&amp;men1 s Committee took place on tie day we leftPetrograd (16th May) and lasted from midnight until fourin the morning.   The French Delegation, with whom ourrelations were quite harmonious, was with us at all curconferences with the Committee, and on the last occasion;M. Thomas and H* Brouckere (of Belgium) also attended0The Committee were also desirous that the British andFrench Socialist and Labour movement should &quot;be representedat the conference the Committee were inviting to meet atStockholm.   We promised to place the invitation before-theLabour and Socialist movement in Great Britain,MEETINGS KITH OTHER ORGAfllSATIOIS &amp; SOLDIERS,While carrying on our communications with the ExecutiveCommittee of the Workmen and Soldiers&apos;&apos;Council, we alfuoaddressed meetings of delegates of the various seotic^s ofthe Council itself, such as the Jewish Bund and the Labourgroup.   The latter body is the most moderate and anti--Germanof the various sections and appears to be influenced verylargely by M. Tchakofsky, who for many years was residentin this country.   I addressed a large Teachers&apos;1 Conferencerepresenting a very influential section of people,   We-,together with the French delegation, placed a wreath on thegraves of the men who fell in the fighting during theRevolution,,   We addressed a large meeting held under theauspices of the Angle-Russian Society at which severalmembers of the Provisional Government and E.M,Ambassadoralso spoke..     We visited the barracks of the Vclynfikiregiment and addressed every company.   The spirit cf thesoldiers and their discipline appeared to^uite good,   Beforewe left, over 700 men from this regiment were drafted to thefront,TOffi-TOILOV FACTORY,We a&amp;o visited the Putilov factory, where we under-stood about 20,000 people were employed0    The factory wasunder the control cf a Workmen1s Committee. who informed us .that they were turning out a larger quantity cf munitionsthan they had been able to do during the last weeks of theOld Regime.   They complained that under the Old Regimethey were kepi? sliert of fuel and material and on severaloccasions had been locked cut owing to shortage in theserespects,.   They were working nine hours per day and statedthat they were quite willing to work longer, provided, fueland material could be secured,,     Vie went through tho variousworkshopsy where we found that the workpeople were working: -satisfactorily and the organisation proceeding smoothly-The Workmen7s Committee were an intelligent body and. althoughconnected with the Workmen and Soldiers Committee, theyrequested us not to think that their views were alwaysrightly expressed by the middle class Intelligen*l**whoformed the majority of the Executive of that &quot;body.THg PRESS.We. gave interviews to the leading newspapers ofPetrograd, but we found that it was difficult to gut intotouch with the journals that expressed the views of thoextreme sections connected with-the Workmen and Soldiers..Council,   These papers appear to be entirely in the hands
- 3 -journalists who are desirous of concentrating theWorkmen1s and Soldiers&apos; attention upon the question of peace.At the request of the Secretary of the SoldiersRepublican Union, I drafted a pamphlet giving an accountof the British aims in the war, and suggesting that thefirst necessary task of the New Russia was the Militarydefeat of Germany.     This pamphlet, I understood, was tobe translated and distributed among the soldiers.y VISIT TO MOSCOW.From Petrograd we went to Moscow, where we were receivedby the local Workmen and Soldiers Committee with cordialityand courtesy.    We visited the Moscow Munition factory, atwhich the workmen appear to be working without friction.We addressed meetings of the co-operators, students, therigfrfc wing of the Socialist Democratic Party and thesoldiers.    The left wing of the Socialist Democraticparty^ however, declined to meet us, on the ground thatwe represented the majority and not the minority of theBritish Socialist and   labour movement.&quot;vP. Repudiation.At Moscow, we learnt that the I.L.P., in England hadissued a repudiation of the British Delegation statingthat we did not represent the British Labour and Socialistmovement.    We drafted a reply to this repudiation Whichappeared in a number of papers in Moscow.    Followingthis letter, an arr&amp;cle appeared in the organ of theWorkmen and Soldiers Committee at Petrograd explainingthat we represented the views of the recognised majorityof the British Labour and Socialist movement, and weretherefore entitled to be received by the Labour andSocialist movement in Russia.   It should&apos;be mentionedthat the repudiation of us by the I.L.P., did not appearto affect adversely our relations with the variousWorkmen and Soldiers organisations with whom we came incontact.   We were alwaya given an opportunity to explainwho and what we represented.VISIT TO THE FRONT.Prom Moscow we paid a ten days1 visit to the Westernand northern fronts * We addressed a member of meetingsof soldiers.    On some occasions tho meetings conprisedfrom 3,000 to 5,000 men.    We wero always received withenthusiasm especially when we impressed upon the soldiersthe necessity of defeating German militarism in order toensure the permandnce of Russian freedom.    At thesemeetings, however, a delegate from the Soldiers and&apos;Workmens Committee at Minsk also spoke.   He talked crudeMarxist socialism and laid great stress on the necessityof tho Allies agreeing to the terms of peace drafted bythe Workmen&apos;^ and Soldiers1 Council at Petrograd,repeating continuously the phrase of n ra annexationsand no contributions,&quot;    It is true that ho alsodeclared t&amp;at there must be no separate peace and nofratornising/
fraternising with the Germans, but the impression heconveyed was that the war was practically a capitalistone and; therefore not of particular moment to the Russian&apos;democracy.   We did our utmost to nullify this impressionand we think we were to a certain extent successful.We had two interviews with General Gourko who expressedthe opinion that his Army would, if time could be given, getover the disorganisation caused by the Revolution and settledown to steady campaigning0    He pointed out, however, thatthere were still grave difficulties in connection withtransport,, leading to shortage of ammunition.   There wasalso insufficient fodder for horses which rendered movementvery difficult.   We also met General Russky at his head-quarters,, but as he was ill we were not able to discuss thesituation with him.   He had, moreover, resigned on the daywe visited him.EES SOLDIERST CQMMITTSSS..We were struck by the excellent physique of the Russiansoldiers and their remarkably good spirits considering thecircumstances in which they had been living during the winter.There is, however, no doubt that there are certain elements &apos;-in the Soldiers1 Committees who are more interested inpolitics and in peace than in restoring discipline on a newbasis in the army.     Both in the Soldiers1 and Workmen1sCouncils and the Soldiers1 Committees the Jewish element Isvery strong,/and we could not help,feeling,, although none ofus is an anti-Semite, that the Jewish influence has nearlyalways an anti-British and pacifist tendenoy, arising.probably from the fact that the Jews in these Committees arenearly always extreme Socialists, whose socialism is drawnalmost entirely from German sources9     It was the Jews who,almost invariably, brought up at our meetings questionsrelating to English rule in Ireland, Egypt or Indian andcriticised British Imperialism which they insisted was thecounterpart of German Imperialism. They lost no opportunity ofurging an immediate peace at almost any price.&quot;DISCIPLINE Iff THE ARMY.It is difficult to express an opinion as to the stateof discipline in the armies as a whole that we visited.   Insome places it appeared to be good and relations betweenofficers and men quite satisfactory; on the other hand, insome places, as for instance at Pskov, wo were informedprivately by the officers that the men were decidedly insubor-dindte.   I was told personally by an office? that the rank andfile refused to do outpost duty and this had to be done by theofficers themselves.     In general there was an air of slacknessabout all tho armies, ah absence of definite work which, weoould not help thinkingmust/
jauat tend to inefficiency, althou^i we were informed that wemust not Judge the Russian army from the British standpoint.THE COALITION MINISTRY.On our return to Petrograd, the crisis which ended in theestablishment of the Coalition Ministry was at its iheight, andit was not completely settled until after the time of ourdeparture;   but we feel that the settlement arrived at hasoaused great improvement in the situation,    Kerensky whom wemet, struck us as being a very sincere man with a powerfulpersonality.    He appears to be trusted both by the Workmen andthe Soldiers.    The other Labour and Socialist representativeswho joined the Coalition have also the confidence of the pBop&amp;ethey represent and are   with the exception perhaps of Skobelef,level-headed and sensible men.   Skobelef is not an extremist,but he is nevertheless a very strong pacifist with an almostpathetic belief that the Russian revolution will influenoe theGerman people to bring about a movement on similar lines inGermany which will be followed by peace.   He is a visionary,apparently with little experience of affairs.THE POST Of LIVING.With regard to the civil population there is no doubt astrong feeling in favour of peace   owing largely to the diffi-oultiee in connection with the food, supply.   The cost of livLnghas gone up tremendously in the towns - for instance, in Moscowcareful examination of prices based on statistics supplied by alocal hospital showed that the cost of living had inoreased inthat town 400 per cent since the beginning of the war.    We wereinformed by some people that there was plenty of food in thecountry, but the difficultjass of transport caused a lack ofoupply in the towns.    Other persons assured us that the stockof food in the country was, unfortunately, very low;   but wehad no means of finding out the truth of either of thesestatements.    The cost of living has also been artificiallyinflated by increases in wages and by the presence in the townsof large numbers of well-to-do persons, who previously livedin the distriotsnow occupied by the enemy.LABOUR UNREST.Unrest caused largely by high prices coupled with disclosedhigh irofita appeared to be very rife in the factories in theMoscow region.   This unrest was, no doubt, stimulated by themore extreme sections of the revolutionary elements, which thei more moderate members of the local Workmen1s and Soldiers1Council found great difficulty in keeping under control.   Out-wardly, however, Moscow and Petrograd, in spite of constant bigdemohstrations and meetings were quite peaceful and orderly.
*TK5 STOCKHOLM COirFT.-REiTCBS.On our journey home we stayed at Stockholm and helda conference with M- Brant i rig, M. Huysmans, M, Van Kol,and M, Treelstra, all of when?. 1 know welly on the subjectthe proposed separate conferences between the variousnational Socialist majorities and minorities and &quot;theInternational Socialist Bureau Executive,     They wereexceedingly anxious that the British Socialist and Labourmovement, both majority and minority,  should come to Stockholm-,and informed us that they hoped that the result of theConferences would be to place the responsibility for the Warand its continuance upon Germany.      They feared that unlessEngland and France were represented the German influencewould be very strong with the highly susceptible Russiansocialists.     M. Branting and M. Van Kol are pro-Ally, butTroelstra is suspected of German sympathies.
