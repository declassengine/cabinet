For information of the War ^Cabinet.From - First Sea Lord.Comparison of the Fleets of the United States and Japan.Generally speaking, the Fleet of the United Statesis much superior numerically and in other -ways to that ofJapan, but with soiae important exceptions.In Dreadnought Battleships completed, the UnitedStates has 14, to Japan1s 3, while she is actually building9, to Japan s 4.Ih pre-Dreadnought Battleships the superiority isequally marked, there being; 23 to.Japan1 s 8, With regard toBattle Cruisers, however, the United States has not a&quot;single one completed, to JapanJs 7, though 4 are being builtand 6 projected.- In case of v/ar between these two Powers inthe near future, this would be a (Treat source of weakness tothe United States, especially in the Phillipines.In the older types of large Cruisers, the UnitedStates has 17, to Japan s 10.In light Cruisers the United States has 20 to Japan1 17, numerically nearly the same, but as a whole they aremuch slower than the Japanese light Cruisers.There are 4 scout Cruisers building for the UnitedStates, to 2 Japanese light Cruisers building;   and 6 scoutCruisers projected for the United States, but even wilfti theae^completed&quot; the number of modern fast light Cruisers is quiteinadequate for the operations of a Fleet of the dimensionsof that of the United States.  &apos;In Destroyers completed the United States and Japanare about the same numerically, &quot;but the United States has28 building and 30 projected,  o Japan s 6 building.   Thereis, however, an absence of any&apos;Flotilla Leaders of 1500 to1800 tons.In Submarines, the United States has a preponderatingadvantage, 44 to 16 completed, and 62 building and 37projected to Japan1s 5 building.In Minelayers, the United States appear to haveno vessels fitted as such, Japan has 8 minelayers oompletedand 12 building or projected.&quot;It is evident from this comparison that as againstJapan only, the most urgent requirements are for lightCruisers, Destroyers, and anti-Submarine craft, and that.with the exception of the Battle Cruisers, it would be awaste of resources to build more capital ships.   The samerequirements apply to the present war, and it seems essentialto press the United States G-overnment to concentrate onbuilding the classes of vessels required even at the costof postponing the completion of the Dreadnought Battleships.fey 1917.(Intld).
