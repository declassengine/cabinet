BRITISH   SALONIKA   FORGE.S ummary - of   inf o ma t i on1st to 30th April, 1917.General Situation.The beginning of April was devoted by all theallied armies to preparing for a general offensive whichhad originally been ordered by General. Sarrail to take placeearly in the. month.     The date was however subsequentlypostponed and after some further changes I was ordered toattack the position held by the enemy west of Doiran lakeon the 24th April.     The allied attack was to commence a fewdays later, and the object of my attacking first was to drawto the east of the Vardar as many as possible of the enemyfstroops that were in reserve.Two days after my attack took place an unprocedentlyheavy fall of snow took place in the mountainous country westof the Vardar and in the Monastir district, which precludedall movement in that area.     General Sarrail thereupon iss-ued orders that operations in the vicinity of Monastirwould be postponed till further orders.Operations - British Forces.In order to carry out the containing role assignedto my troops on the Struma front, frequent &apos;patrol actionshave been undertaken, and bombardments of the enemy&apos;spositions, in which the Navy have co-operated effectivelyin the Neohori area, have been carried out..   The superiorityof our troops over the enemy on this front has been mostmarked in these encounters.     The activity of the enemyhas been confined to patrolling and to the shelling by/artillery
artillery of villages in the proximity of our front line,On the Doiran - Vardar front our preparations for anattack were completed by the 8th April as originally ordered.From that date onwards patrol encounters and reconnaissances wereof nightly occurrence and a steady bombardment was maintained onthe enemy&apos;s position.    This was increased during the days 22ndto 24th, and on the evening of the latter date I attacked theenemy&apos;s positions south-wost of Lake Doiran from the lake to apoint P 4^ (1100 yards north-east cf Krastali)- with two divisions,the 26th Division being on the right from the lake to JumeauxRavine and the 2 2nd Division thence to point P 4^ (see attachedoperation map 1/20,000).     The 60th Division at the same timecarried out a raid on the Macukovo salient.

Preparations for a continuance of theattack on the right are in progress,In order to compete with the activity of the enemy&apos;saeroplanes I have been lent temporarily by the Vice-AdmiralCommanding Eastern Mediterranean Squadron 5 fighting machinesAnd 10
and 10 bombing machines.   My position as regards aviationis thus temporarily-improved,&apos;but nevertheless the hostilemachines on the Doiran front Still outnumber and outclassany that I can oppose them with.French Force.On the 18th, the French lost the positions they hadgained on the Crvena Stena north-west of Monastir but re-took them two days later and their general situation remainsunchangediIn preparation for the general offensive-certainredistributions of troops have been effected as shown inthe accompanying sketch, map.Serbian, Russian and Italian Forces.There have been no operations of importance On theSerbian front during the month.     Attention has beenconcentrated on preparations for the offensive and with thisin view the Cavalry division has moved up from Eksisu tothe vicinity of Vostaran, the Danube division has moved toPetalino in reserve to 1st Army, being relieved by theliorava division, and the Vardar division is now at Tresinain reserve to 2nd Army.     The health and moral of theSerbian troops is reported to be good whereas the disciplineand efficiency of the 4th Russian Brigade attached tc itIs reported to be indifferent.Nothing worthy of note has occurred on theItalian front.Greek National Forces.Since the statement ccntained in my report of1st March summarising the results obtained up to that datein regard to the formation of the National Greek Army, theprincipal events of note have been :-(a) the arrival of certain detachments from the islandsand also appreciable parties from Continental Greece,/(b)
(b) the general mobilisation proclaimed, in. the islands onthe 18th April.The arrivals alluded to under (a) brought thefigures of troops at Salonika on the 20th April to:--Total strength of the troops ofthe Provisional Government nowat Salonika, including those atuhe front -    -  18,515Numbers estimated by bayonets alonefa) At Salonika     - 5,599(b) At the front   - 7,63613,435The embarkation Of further fcrmed units from theinlands was due to commence on the 23rd April, but no troopsactually arrived in Salonika until the BOth instant, whenthe 4th regiment of infantry belonging to the Archipelagodivision arrived from Mitylene.     These men had all personalequipment, with the exception of rifles, which (French .pattern) will be supplied in Salonika,     The arrivals continueand the whole of the Archipelago division is expected to bein Salonika by the 13th May.     It is not known at presentwhen any of this division will be ready to leave for thefront, financial difficulties having hung matters up forsome time.1 attach a table showing the official figures givenfo r a Greek division of the National Defence Army,  jut itshould be remarked that the division already at the fronthas not been completed up to the authorised establishmentby table*Admini st rat i on.(i)- Owing to a spell ef wet weather last month thecompletion of the Guvesne railhead was&quot; somewhat delayed;though the railway portion of the work was finished in the/specified
specified time, yet the construction of roads within the yardand depots had necessarily to be suspended during the^unfavourable weather. The railhead and supply depots willin a few days be sufficiently advanced to admit of practicallyall supplies being despatched by rail..  The opening of thisrailhead will remove the necessity of retaining Likovan as atransit depot though certain reserves of foodstuffs andammunition will be kept at that place.(ii)      The series of &quot;docks&quot; at Stavros have been completedand are in use and the laying of a heavier type of Decauvillerail on the track from Stavros towards Cajagzi is now inprogress..(ill)     The relaying of the Decauville line from Sarigolto Snevce is contemplated..   As soon as the preparatorymeasures are completed it is estimated that it will be carriedthrough in a fortnight. The old track and locomotives willbe returned to the French.(iv) The road from Dudular to Janes is completed and isin first class order.(v) The large increase in General Hospitals andConvalescent Depots now to be maintained here will entail aconsiderable amount of work on the R,E. services, water supplyand road making in particular. In addition, the amount ofmechanical transport with the Force or promised will be inade-quate for maintenance of these additional hospitals etc., andfor carriage of men to convalescent depots. The additions requir-ed in this respect are being examined and a demand will shortlybe made. Sites for these hospitals and depots have beenselected and preparations begun on those that will earliestbe required.(vi) At the instigation of General Sarrail the question ofthe transfer to the British Army of all the transit facilitieson the English Quay was resumed with the Greek ProvisionalGovernment
Government and is no?/ concluded.     This will materially aidour landing facilities and will tend to mere rapir1 dischargeof shipsc(vii) Certain areas have been set aside for hay, and 1200acres have been planted with potatoes.(Signed)    CEO.
