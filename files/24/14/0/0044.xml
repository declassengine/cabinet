1193Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.fj? RUSSIAN STATEMENT OF WAR AIMS.The formation of the new Coalition Government in Russiawas the result of a conflict about war aims.    It was. a corn-promise between the Imperialists and the Pacifists, the pro-gramme of the new Government being &quot;no annexations orindemnities&quot; on the one hand and the vigorous prosecution ofthe war on the other.   It is recognised both in Russia aidabroad that the maintenance of the Coalition Government isthe only safeguard against civil war and that if it failsRussia must be regarded as practically out of the war.Its stability very largely depends on the sympathetic attitudeof the Allied Governments towards Russia&apos;s war aims and unlesssome answer can be given agreeing to the general principleof &quot;no annexations or indemnities&quot; the Coalition agreement maybreak down.     It must be recognised that it would probablybe impossible in such a declaration to meet in their entiretyall the demands of the present Government in Russia, butenough should be said to assure them of our substantialsympathy.     Of course the effect of such a declaration bothin Germany and in England would have   to be taken intoconsideration.The principle &quot;no annexations&quot; as understood by us implies&quot;no change of Government against the will of the peopleconcerned&quot;! in other words, the self-determination of nations.This principle can, of course, only be applied to Europeancountries.   Therefore, in dealing with our war aims we should
have to make a distinction between the several cases:-(a) European nationalities who are capable ofdetermining their own Government on a democratic basis.(b) The more primitive nations of Africa which havenever enjoyed any semblance of civilised self-government.(c) Asiatic nations hitherto oppressed by Turkishmisrule.As regards Europe we do not in any way recede merelyat the dictation of Russia from statements already madeby us officially:   all that Russia requires is that thesestatements should admit of explanation on the same principleas she has herself enunciated, i.e. self-determination.This principle would hav^e to be applied to the(1) people of Alsace-Lorraine   (2) Italians   (3) Poles(4) Jugo-Slavs   (5) Rumanians   (6) Czecho-Slovaks   andno less to our enemies the Magyars and the Austrian-Germans, the former being given the right to independenceand the latter to incorporation with their kinsmen inthe German Empire should they so desire.   The future ofall these peoples can be determined by ConstituentAssemblies on the Russian model.     If the Russian principleof ,!self-determination of nations&quot; is meant seriously,then there is nothing they could rightly object to insuch an application of it.Such a declaration  would not mean an alterationof what have always been British war aims.   Rather, itwould be a reassertion of the principles of freedomand the rights of small nations for which both Mr Asquithand rlr Lloyd George have always declared we are fighting
and. to the recognition of which the British Government looksfor the establishment of lasting peace.   But such a reassertionis not superfluous.    It should be made in an amplified andexplanatory form and we should endeavour to show theRussian people that all the solutions we propose of territorialquestions are in conformity Tilth these principles we have beenchampioning right through the war.   A comparison very muchto the advantage of the British Government might be madebetween Britain&apos;s consistent attitude on these questions andthe constantly changing tone of the German Government.A comparison of the Imperial ChancellorTs speeches at variousmoments of the war - e.g. in August 1915 and now - would showthat his attitude has been undisguisedly annexationist andhis more moderate tone now has been adopted on account of thecheerless military prospects facing his country.   The Germanshave never clearly enunciated or consistently adopted anygeneral idealistic principle of international settlement suchas our Governments have to their credit.   They have alwaysbeen as chauvinistic as events allowed and their modificationsof their extreme demands are purely opportunist.   If tactfullystated, there is no doubt a far more impressive appeal couldbe made to the Russian people by the British than by theGerman Government.In regard to uncivilised races, it is in the case oftropical Africa alone that practical difficulties are likelyto arise.   As to this it may be asserted confidently that theformula, &quot;no annexation&quot; does not apply as against the nativetribes, for, under the present condition of the world, theonly method of securing to the natives some kind of protection
against the heartless exploitation of white traders, is thatthey should be placed under the sovereignty or protectionof some civilised power.   The phrase, therefore, has a mean-ing only so far as it applies to the conquest in the warby one country of the colonial possessions of another.It would undoubtedly be very desirable to avoid in futureextending the warfare between white races to tropicalregions.    This can in practice only be done by referringto the principles which were put forward at the time of theBerlin Conference regarding Africa, viz; that the partitionof the continent between European States should be arrangedby friendly agreement and negotiation.   There seems no reasonwhy Great Britain should not accept this principle for thefuture.   That means in practice that she should not actas she did in 1814 when she made it a condition of takingpart in the Congress ot Vienna that its discussion should beconfined to European mattersat that time BritishColonial conquests were made the subject of separate arrange-ments with each individual State, and were not brought intothe general settlement.   This precedent should not be followed.This means in fact that Great Britain should not declare onher own mere will that she proposes to retain German EastAfrica, but that she should be willing to submit theultimate disposition of this province to the   decisions ofthe Conference.The second point on which stress should be laid isthat every nation which holds possessions in Central Africashould agree to submit to those general rules and regulationsas to the treatment of the natives which might be determinedon by general agreement.   This would, of course, Include the
/prohibition of all slavery, regulations as to the trade inliquor and in arms, and such other similar regulations asmight appear desirable.   This implies the principle that therule over these districts should not be absolute sovereignty,but a conditional sovereignty subject to the rules, and,eventually perhaps, the control of an international Institution.7. The third point regarding tropical possessions is thequestion of free trade, especially equality and opportunityto traders of all nations to   export raw material.   Aclaim that this principle should be established will doubt-less be put forward.   As this principle is one which has beenaccepted by the British Government fcop- the last 100 years,any claim, if it is made, will be not as against GreatBritain, but as against France,   It is, therefore, not amatter on which it is necessary for this country at presentto make any observations.8. Intermediate between European and uncivilised races,come the semi-civilised and often decadent peoples who havesuffered under Turkish mis-government.    In this category comenot only the whole of the Turkish Empire as it existed at thebeginning of the war, but also Persia and the North coast ofAfrica.   The general principle to be applied here seems to bethat where the character of the population, as determined bythe degree of civilisation and the religious and racialhomogeneity, allow a fair presumption that a native governmentcan be established, this should be done;   but in these casesit will undoubtedly be necessary, in order to secure theessentials of good administration, that some form of controlor protectorate should be assigned to some European State.
The Germans should bo brought, as the Dutch andFor instance it may be anticipated that it will bo possibleto set up a Sultan or Khalif in Bagdad, but if this is doneit will be necessary to entrust some European power with thegeneral supervision.   In the case of Bagdad, this dutywould no doubt be claimed by Great Britain just as GreatBritain would claim some kind of protectorate over Arabia,while leaving the government in the hands of the nativechiefs and tribes.   This system would in the same way beapplicable to Syria, though here, in view of the very.jaixe.d_character both racial and religious of the population, itwould be even more necessary to establish some form ofEuropean control.   The protectorate over Syria wouldnaturally be assigned to France.   There are other districts^.,for instance those adjoining the lower waters of the Tigrisand the Euphrates, in which there is probably no nucleuson which any kind of civilised government could be set up.9. It is probable that the question of annexation ofcolonial possessions in the South Seas and in Australasiawill not in fact be of any difficulty;   nobody in Russiais likely to trouble much about the destiny of, for instance,the Samoa Islands or Gorman Now Guinea.   With regard, however,to Australasia and to South Africa, it will probably benecessary to put forward something in the nature of aMonroe doctrine.   This is of special importance in regardto German South West Africa.   The principle seems to bethat the whole of Africa South of the Zambesi must be regardedas a single political unit, and that the settlement madeafter the Boer War should be extended to the German Colony.
The attached memorandum has been drawn up by the differentsections tf this Bureauiin consultation.5The remarks made at the end of paragraph jL. may not commendthemselves at the moment;   but I venture to think that the ptintmight bo perhaps be borne in mind if occasion should arise.    Asis $bvioua, any positive declaration binding the Government tothe annexation of German East Africa either by union with BritishSouth Africa or in any other way, if made at this time, mighthave unfortunate results, as tending to produce doubts as to oursincerity.
the English have been, into one self-governing dominion-in this way, and in this way alone, can it be securedthat wars originating in Europe shall not extend to thispart of the world.It would probably be unnecessary and therefore unwiseto make any reference in a public declaration to thecontents of this paragraph.
