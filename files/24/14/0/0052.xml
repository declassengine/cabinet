MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.for Week ending Wednesday, May 23, 1917.PART I. ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Prices and Supplies.Cereals. The Oat and Maize Products (Retail Prices) No. 2 Order, 1917, datedMay 23, 1917, provides that on and after June 18 the maximum retail price ofoatmeal, rolled oats, flaked oats, and other like products of oats shall be 4^d. per lb.in Scotland, and 5d. per lb. elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It further providesthat from the same date the maximum price for maize flour, maize flakes, maizesemolina, hominy, and maize meal shall be S^d. per lb. in the United Kingdom.The Committee appointed by Lord Devonport to undertake the purchase andcontrol of oats required from overseas for the United Kingdom and the Allies, and totake over the duties and responsibilities of the existing Allies Forage Committee, hasbeen constituted as follows: Mr. S. F. Mendl (Chairman).The Right Hon. Thomas Wiles, M.P.Mr. R. H. Selbie.Mr. E. J. feiLEY (War Office).Mr. Harry Kent (Commission Internationale de Ravitaiilement).Monsieur Destombe (French Representative).Lieutenant Amadio (Italian Representative).Monsieur Van Rompa (Belgium Representative).Secretary, Mr. H. A Francis.The present address of the Committee is Empire House, Kingsway, W.C.The Australian Government have arranged for the fullest possible conversioninto flour of the *vheat purchased by the Imperial Government, the estimated outputbeing 40,000 tons monthly until 31st December. The Wheat Commission anticipatethat they will be able to provide tonnage at the rate of 15/20,000 tons per month.In view of the political situation in Russia the Wheat Commission have concurredin the Foreign Office decision to forego the export of the wheat previously promisedby the Russian Government to the Allies.The Food Controller has issued a general licence authorising the sale andexposure for sale of (1) loaves of bread in the shape of pan coburg loaves and twin sister brickloaves; and(2) rolls of bread weighing not less than one ounce and not more than twoounces.The Flour Mills Control Committee are in consultation with the Associations ofMaster Bakers for the purpose of ascertaining the actual cost of producing bread.The amended percentages for extraction from wheat and permitted added substancesare now in operation. It has been decided to fix a maximum price for screenings,tailings, and damaged wheat in order to prevent speculative dealings in these articles.The general policy of manufacturing flour in England for export to Ireland has beenconsidered in connection with the distribution of offals and cake in that country, andit was decided that so far as possible Irish mills should provide for the Irishpopulation with a view to saving cross-channel traffic.The control of the flour mills has enabled the Ministry to remedy a grievancewhich might have caused trouble. Attention had been called in Parliament to therefusal of a Swansea milling firm to supply the Port Talbot Co-operative Society withflour in view of the fact that the Co-operative Society were selling bread at a lowerprice than that agreed upon by the Master Bakers&apos; Association. The millers wereinstructed by the Ministry of Food to supply the necessary flour but informed thesociety that owing to accumulated orders some weeks must elapse before deliverycould be made.   The National Transport Workers Federation intervened and pointed.a  (33)2955-4   Pk 1   50  5/17   E &amp; S AI SECRET.
out the seriousness of the position. An inspector was sent at &quot;once to Swansea withthe result that 76 sacks of flour were delivered to the Co-operative Society who haveexpressed their gratitude for the action taken.Meat. It was stated in the House of Commons on the 16th instant that thequestion of controlling the prices and supplies of meat was under the considerationof the Food Controller in consultation with the various departments concerned there-with. Conferences have taken place with the Butchers Federation, who complainthat meat both live and dead is the subject of repeated speculative resales before itreaches them. The fixing of maximum prices for meat is peculiarly difficult owing tothe difference (a) in calculations of weight between live and dead stock, and (b) invaluations of the different portions of the meat when killed. As the Army arepurchasers of whole beasts the second complication does not affect their purchases.The suggestion has been made to fix the price of Army beef on a sliding scaledownwards from August to December. The price so fixed might afford a basis forfixing the maximum price of whole beasts for civilian consumption should thenecessity arise.Sugar. The Sugar (Restriction) No. 3 Order, 1917, dated May 18,1917, substitutesthe following table for the table contained in article 2 of the previous amendingOrder restricting the use of sugar in manufacture : Percentage of total Sugar Period for which such Percentageused in 1915. is applicable.61 per cent. - - - 1st June 1917 to 31st August 1917.12^ per cent. - 1st June 1917 to 30th November 1917.18f per cent. - - - 1st June 1917 to 28th February 1918.25 per cent. - - - 1st June 1917 to 31st May 1918.The result of this Order is to reduce the amount of sugar available for manu-facturing purposes from 40 per cent, to 25 per cent, of that so used in 1915.Two more cargoes (together 11,237 tons) were lost last week through submarines.The Sugar Commission has made a special purchase of 20,000 tons of Americanrefined sugar for immediate shipment, in order to meet the requirements of fruitpreserving; and arrangements for regulating the distribution of this sugar are nowunder the consideration of the Ministry of Food and the Commission. A portion ofthis sugar will be specifically earmarked for private fruit-growers who wish to preservetheir fruit at home for domestic consumption, and a notice to this effect invitingapplications has been inserted in the Press.A Note on the subject of supplies for the six months, September 1917 to February1918 inclusive, has been drawn up by the Commission and is being forwarded bythe Chairman for the information of the Cabinet.Rationing.The - Food Controller has submitted for the approval of the War Cabinet amemorandum relating to the machinery which he proposes to set up for the distributionand rationing of essential food-stuffs.Food Economy.A house-to-house canvas is now in progress in many of the larger towns andagricultural areas. At Worthing (as a typical instance) out of 2,000 householderscanvassed, 92 per cent, have signed the pledge to reduce consumption of food. InLeeds the Economy Campaign is reported to be making excellent progress in theschools, and the Portsmouth Education Committee is displaying a food economy posterin every classroom.The workers in Lancashire and Yorkshire mills (where considerable waste of foodwas reported) are being approached by leaflet, poster, and works&quot; meeting.In Maidenhead reports have been received from 50 per cent, of the houses, andonly 5 per cent, were found where the ration was now exceeded. &quot;The Queen and Princess Mary opened at Westminster Bridge Road an experimentalkitchen on May 2lst. The menu included roast beef (4eL), swedes and boiled onions(Id.), carrot soup (Id. and 2d.), rhubarb mould (l\d), rice pudding (l%d.), andmaize scones (^d.).
Enforcement of Orders.The past week has shown considerable improvement in the observance of theFood Controller^ Orders, partly owing to more organised activity on the part of thepolice and of local authorities, partly owing to the presence in their respectivedistricts of the inspectors appointed by the Ministry of Food. The policy of merelycautioning casual offenders has enabled the Ministry to ask for and obtain severepenalties where the offence was clearly deliberate. Thus a potato merchant who hadnot only contravened the Orders himself but had induced others to follow his examplewas fined 1001. and 41. costs. In an offence against the Food (Conditions of Sale)Order, the assistant who served the customer was fined 5s., while her employer wasfined 251. For feeding wheat to pigeons on three separate occasions an offender wasfined in all lOOZ., and ten guineas costs.An inquiry addressed by the Ministry to a North London greengrocer as to theprices paid by him for potatoes has elicited an admission from a large Lincolnshiregrower that he has obtained prices in excess of the legal maximum on practically allhis sales since the beginning of April, and that his illegal profits amount to upwardsof 7,0001. Investigations clearly indicate that while dealers&apos; books show only thelegal prices, additional sums have frequently passed, either in cash or by way offictitious transactions, such as 2001. for a rabbit and 400Z. for a worthless horse.Measures have been taken to check the lavish, display of sweetmeats andchocolates in confectioners&apos; windows, and a more chastened appearance now prevails.The Scottish Office have now circularised local authorities in Scotland on thesubject of the powers conferred on them by the Order made by the Secretary forScotland on the 14th inst.There are grounds for believing that in Ireland the Horses (Rationing) Order isbeing largely ignored.PART II. SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.Imports.Imports of food in the week ending May 19th, though not quite so large as inthe preceding week, were satisfactory. The total amounted to 240,000 tons (Table A)compared with 234,000 tons in the corresponding week of 1916 and an average of202,000 tons in the first 20 weeks of 1917.The articles, imports of which are most markedly above the average, are wheat(128,000 tons against a weekly average of 94,000 tons since the beginning of thisyear); flour, of which 12,000 tons were received, as against a weekly average of8,000 tons; and barley, imports of which amounted to 16,700 tons against a weeklyaverage of 8,300 tons. Imports of lard, cheese, sugar, and glucose were also abovethe average. On the other hand the receipts of bacon, hams, margarine, butter, oats,and maize were relatively low. *The total imports of fifteen of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs since thebeginning of the year now amount to 4,048,000 tons, as compared with 4,510,000 tonsin the corresponding period of 1916, a reduction of 462,000 tons, or 10 per cent.The articles showing the greatest deficiencies are barley (163,000 tons), wheat(149,000 tons), oats (134,000 tons), sugar (130,000 tons), and wheaten flour (54,000tons). Imports of beef, mutton, and margarine have also been lower than in thecorresponding period of last year. Maize, on the other hand, shows an increase of167,000 tons and the imports of lard, cheese, and butter are also substantially greaterthan in 1916.Consumption of Meat.The supplies of dead meat entering the markets at London, Liverpool, Manchester,and Glasgow during the week ending May 12th (Table B.), though rather greater, inthe aggregate, than during the previous week, were still markedly below the weeklyaverage for April and 15 per cent, lower than in the corresponding week of 19.16.&apos;In the week ending May 19th, the supplies entering the Central Market, London,were over 8 per cent, lower than in the preceding week, and 16 per cent, lower thanin the corresponding week of last year.In addition to the returns for the markets included in Table B., returns have nowbeen received for the Birmingham market, but it is, unfortunately, impossible in thiscase to give comparative figures for 1916. The returns show average weekly entriesof 593 tons in January, 520 tons in February, 529 tons in March, 499 tons in April,and 450 tons for the week ending May 5th. These figures run fairly parallel withthe totals given in Table B.a2
The supplies of fat cattle at 51 markets in Great Britain (Table C), thoughslightly lower than last week, were again well above the averages for precedingmouths of this year, and nearly 10 per cent, higher than the average of the correspondingweeks cf 1914-16.The supplies of fat sheep, on the other hand, showed an increase of 25 per cent,on the preceding week, but were 9 per cent, below the corresponding numbers for1914-16.The number of fat pigs was slightly lower than in the preceding week, and11 per cent, below the triennial average.Stocks of Cereals.Wheat. The stock on May 21st is estimated at 1,103,000 tons as against1,078,000 tons on May.14th, 1,132,000 tons a month ago, and 1,403,000 tons on thecorresponding date in 1916.Barley. The stocks on May 21st are estimated at 386,000 tons as against389,000 tons on May 14th and 408,000 tons a month ago.Oats.-The stocks on May 21st are estimated at 293,000 tons as against336,000 tons on May 14th, and 319,000 tons a month ago.Maize. The stocks on May 21st are estimated at 120,000 tons as against139.000 tons on May 14th, and 151,000 tons a month ago.Wholesale Prices.The latest available wholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs (Table D) show,in most cases, little change from those of the preceding week. The only noteworthychanges are increases of 6s. per cwt. in English mutton (following a rise of 24s. Qd.per cwt. in the previous week), 3s. per cwt. in English beef, 2s. per cwt. in XewZealand butter and Irish bacon, Is. Qd. per cwt. in Danish bacon, 15s. per ton inpalm-kernel cake, and an average of between Id. and 2d. per lb. in tea, and decreasesof 2s. per cwt. in English cheddar cheese, Is. per cwt. in Canadian cheese and Irishbutter, and Is. per sack in country straight run flour.Compared with a month ago, the most marked changes affect English andArgentine mutton, the price of the former having risen by 31s. per cwt. (equivalentto nearly 3%d. per lb.), while the price of the latter has fallen by 22s. per cwt., ornearly 2\d. per lb. Argentine chilled beef is higher in price by 8s. per cwt. andEnglish beef by 3s. 6d. per cwt., Irish bacon by 4s. per cwt., and Canadian bacon by2s. per cwt.; but Danish bacon is lower by 4s. Qd. per cwt. Of the cereals, maize isdearer by 5s. per quarter (480 lbs.), but British wheat, barley, and oats are cheaperby 6s. llcZ. per 480 lbs., 5s. Sd. per 400 lbs., and 4s. Qd. per 312 lbs. respectively, asa result of the Wheat, Barley, and Oats (Prices) Order, and the price of country flouris also lower by 2s. Qd. per sack (280 lbs.). The prices of oilseed cake have advancedby 13s. per ton for cottonseed cake, 20s. per ton for linseed cake, and 35s. per ton forpalm-kernel cake, whilst those of Calcutta linseed and palm kernels have fallen by45s. and 20s. per ton respectively. There have been also increases of 6s. per cwt. inNew Zealand butter, and of Id. to 2d. per lb. in tea, and reductions of 2s. Qd. per cwt.in Danish butter and English cheddar cheese. There was no change in the prices ofimported wheat, London (town made) flour, rice, Canadian cheese, and sugar.The articles showing the greatest increases since the corresponding date in 1916are palm-kernel cake (183s. per ton, or 117 per cent.), linseed cake (180s. per ton, or70 per cent.), British oats (22s. 2d. per quarter of 312 lb., or 67 per cent.), Calcuttalinseed (204s. per ton, or 52 per cent.), rice (9s. 9d. per cwt., or 52 per cent.), maize(23s. Qd. per 480 lbs., or 46 per cent.), British wheat [22s. lid. per 480 lbs., or 42 percent.), cheese (47s. Qd. per cwt., or 41 to 42 per cent.), and Canadian bacon (40s. percwt., or 41 per cent.).The price of war flour in London is higher than that of &quot; Town households &quot;a year ago by per cent., while the price of country straight run flour exceeds thatof &quot; country whites &quot; in May, 1916, by 55 per cent. The sale prices of tea, even afterallowing for the proportion allocated to buyers at Is. per lb. without passing throughthe auctions, are above those of a year ago by averages of nearly 4J.d. per lb. in thecase of Indian tea and about 3%d. per lb. for Ceylon tea. There are also substantialincreases in the prices of English mutton (331- per cent.), Irish bacon (32 per cent.),Egyptian cotton-seed (31 per cent.), butter (20 to 29 per cent.), British barley (23 percent.), palm kernels (24 per cent.), and Danish bacon (22 per cent.). Apart fromEnglish mutton, butchers&apos; meat shows comparatively little advance in price, thepercentage increases being 4 for Argentine mutton, 13 for Argentine beef, and 16 for British beef.   The price of sugar is practically unchanged.
