OPERATIONS.From:-   Major General Barter.To:-       C.I.G.S. 24/5/17.handed in 12.47 a.m,1058. May 23rd. Most Secret.Following is from authoritative source:-The question of offensive operations during the ensuing summerbeing dependent on internal conditions, Alexeieff with the commandersof the four fronts went to Petrograd last week to expound theirviews on the matter to the Government and the Executive Committeeof Soldiers and Workmen and to ascertain clearly if the support ofthese bodies could be counted upon.   The result of this journey wasnot such as to afford complete security that the military plancontemplated may not be prejudiced by internal political consider-ations but the C. in C. believes that the inclusion of a proportionof the Socialist opposition in the new Government and the energyof Karenski, the new Minister of War, give reason for some hope,The morale of the army is however seriously impaired so thatoffensive operations can only be initiated when all formationscan be relied on to advance when ordered as the bad example of onerecalcitrant unit might be followed by all the other units.   Theenemy is making skilful use of this moral lapse by deceivingthe Russian troops on the front with false prospects of peace.Only about two days ago about 40 enemy agents including Brigadiersand Colonels presented themselves on the front of the 9th Armyand parleyed with the Russian troops.IProspective operations on the Roumanian front were recentlyY Jconsidered at a conference held here by Alexeieff with Bratiano,Presan and Shorbacheff. Last-named has only been a short time incommand of Russian troops in Roumania and so far has not had timeto visit all his troops.   He was thus unable to offer conclusiveopinion but Bratiano and Presan urged the grand offensive. Presanput forward a plan which Alexeieff could not altogether approve
and he doubted if in the present state of the Roumanian Armyand with the impossibility of sending further troops fromRussia, an offensive in the grand style could be undertakenin that country.   The plan of the proposed offensive will befurther considered when Sherbacheff has completed his studyof the situation in Roumania.     It is hoped that this offen-sive will be initiated between June 20th and 30th (new styjhe)by which date 4 more Roumanian divisions will be ready.On south-western front preparations are being activelypressed for proposed offensive.   Another Army Corps is beingtransported thither as well as all the heavy artillery andaeroplanes available but it is necessary first to revive thespirit of the troops and to induce them to advance whencalled upon.     Great reliance in this direction is placed onthe energetic fighting influence of Brusiloff and if theeffort achieves good results it will1 be possible to initiatean offensive here between June ISth and 20th (new style).On western front practically simultaneously with theseoperations an action in the nature of a demonstration willbe taken by General Gurko.On northern front intention is to observe a defensivebecause although danger of hostile dash against Petrograd isyet vague still the menace of such a stroke might exercise agreat effect on the morale of the capital.    Only If thismenace disappears altogether it may be possible to initiatesome secondary active operations on this front.Thus the present intention is to stand on the defensiveon the northern front, to demonstrate on the western front,and to act offensively on the Roumanian and south-westernfronts.
