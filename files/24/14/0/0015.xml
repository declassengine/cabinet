From Poliiical Resident, Aden, 22nd May 19] 7.(Addressed to Foreign, Simla, repeated, to Secretary of Stale for India andHigh Commissioner, Cairo.)(Received at India Office 6 p.m.)366 A.P. Your telegram 634 S. of 21st May. Formation of confederacydue primarily to Don-committal, if not pro-Turk attitude, of Imam, and not topronounced hostility to Tmam himself.Their first objective is Turkish troops in Yemen and Lahej itself, theyrequire leader of Imunic race, hence selection of Said Mahomet Bin YehiaBin Al Hadi Bin Al Muayed Billali Bin Al Kasim.If Iman identified himself with movement he might possibly, but notprobably, retain his position.Without assistance in ammunition and money confederacy cannot keepfield long enough to secure ejection of Turkish troops. With suchassistance Yemen should be clear Turks by end of year. If they cannotget assistance from us they will look to Italy, and from local indications willnot look in vain, I know nothing of outside situation and policy as regardsYemen.In promising assistance I think we can make it clear we are impelled byanti-Turk motives only, and are not concerned in selection of their leader ofconfederacy.I realise that reinforcements for us here are not available, or I wouldhave preferred to initiate the offensive ourselves. But complete inaction andrefusal of assistance to movement must permanently affect our prestige.
