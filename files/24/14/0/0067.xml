Report.To the Right Honourable Christopher Addison, M.D., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Minister ofMunitions.Sir, May 17, 1917.1. THE Committee held its first meeting on the 19th December, 1916, when theestimated figures of requirements and production of alcohol for war seiwices and theessential industrial trades were considered.(A.) Review of the Earlier Position.2. The war requirements which could be definitely defined are : (a.) The manufacture of propulsive explosives and certain high explosives,(o.) The transport service.3. There is also a considerable quantity of alcohol used in the form of methylatedspirit for various purposes connected with the war, as, for example, in the manufactureof varnish for shells, and alcohol is also being used to a large extent for the Army andNavy and Aircraft Services, and in the production of ether, chloroform, and othermedical supplies.4. The manufacture of prooulsive explosives is by far the largest demand that hasto be provided for, as owing to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient supplies of acetone the solvent used prior to the war in the manufacture of cordite an explosive of similarcomposition was introduced, the solvent for which is a mixture of ether and alcohol,the ether itself being manufactured from alcohol. In addition to the alcohol requiredfor the manufacture of this form of cordite, it has also been decided to commence themanufacture in this country of nitro-cellulose powder, for supplies of which Great Britainis at present dependent upon Canada and America.5. For the month of December, when the Committee commenced its deliberations,the estimated monthly requirements of alcohol for war services and the industrial tradesamounted to 2,800,000 proof gallons, while the production from the patent stilldistilleries was 3,200,000 gallons, but the requirements were expected to increase monthby month until by June 1917 they would reach 4,240,000 gallons. The detailed figuresare given in Appendix I. Even allowing for increased manufacture of alcohol atmolasses distilleries, the total^production was not expected to exceed the Decemberfigure, dn consequence of the conversion of several of the large distilleries from alcoholmanufacture to the making cf acetone.6. The requirements referred to did not include any provision of alcohol for themanufacture of nitro-cellulose oowder, as until some idea could be formed as to whenthe nitro-cellulose factories would be ready, the Committee decided to leave this matterout of their consideration.7. The figures for alcohol required for propulsive explosives submitted to theCommittee represented gross requirements, that is to say, no allowance had been madefor the recovery of the solvent in the course of the manufacture of the powder, but theCommittee understood that the question of &quot; recovery &quot; was receiving attention, andthere appeared to be little doubt that a considerable quantity of the alcohol used in thefirst place would be recovered, so that the actual requirements for propulsive explosives-would be much less than the quantity estimated for.8. At a meeting of the Committee held in January, reports were presented byMr. Ross and Mr. Bayne showing the total quantity of alcohol that could be obtainedfrom the English, Scotch, and Irish patent still distilleries. These reports were veryexhaustive, and showed that the output could be so increased that, provided the&quot;recovery&quot; expected in the manufacture of powder were realised, the patent stilldistillers of the United Kingdom would be able, with the consent of the Board ofCustoms and Excise to the modification of certain regulations, to meet the demands forspirit likely to be made upon them.9. The patent still representatives informed the Committee that the distillers ofthe United Kingdom had voluntarily agreed amongst themselves that, after the1st January, 1917, no patent still spirit should be bonded for whiskey, but thatthe whole production should be reserved for war purposes and the industrial trades.As, however, the rectifiers and compounders needed a, certain quantity of new spirit in
order to keep alive some portion of their trade, particularly for the preservation of theirexport brands, the distillers considered that 2,250,000 gallons for the year or about40 per cent, of the normal quantity should be allocated for gin and compounds.10. The-Committee discussed very fully the question of the use of the pot stills inScotland and Ireland for the production of alcohol for industrial instead of potablepurposes, but, in view of the probability that all requirements could be met by thepatent stills, while pot still spirit was more expensive to produce, and would have to beredistilled to bring it to the requisite high strength, the Committee came to theconclusion that it was unnecessary to entertain the idea. The Scotch and Irish pot stillreDresentatives undertook, however, to consider whether it would be possibleto cheapen and increase the pot still output.11. The Committee considered at your request a memorandum on the &quot;Provisionof Alcohol for the manufacture of Munitions &quot; prepared by a Committee of the RoyalSociety. The Chairman communicated to you by minute on the 18th January, 1917,the result of the Committees discussion, and a note *of the Committee&apos;s opinion isattached to this Report (see Appendix II).12. The foregoing represented the position of alcohol requirements and supplies asit appeared to the Committee when it last met on the 9th January, 1917.(B.) Altered Position due to Tonnage Difficulties.13. Subsequently to the meeting of the 9th January, the whole position altered insuch a way as to nullify the work the Committee had done, and to render furthermeetings unnecessary for the time being. Instead of increasing the output of alcohol,the question of reducing production became of paramount importance.14. Circumstances arose which rendered it necessary to reduce tonnagerequirements in every possible direction, and, as alcohol is made very largely fromimported grain, you decided on the 22nd February, 1917, as a first step, that themanufacture of acetone in the two distilleries which had been converted for the purposeshould cease, that the work in progress of altering four more distilleries should not becompleted, and that these four distilleries and the three other distilleries which were atthat date producing alcohol only should be closed down. Sixteen patent stilldistilleries remained; these were all engaged in the production of yeastas well as of alcohol, and as the supply of yeast is indispensable these distilleriescontinue to operate but do not work any plain mashes, that is, mashes in which noyeast is produced. There remain five distilleries producing alcohol from molasses, either .imported as such or produced in the sugar refineries in this county. These are stillworking. Owing, however, to the shortage of molasses these distilleries are producingmueh below their maximum capacity. On the 23rd March you further decided thatthe continued manufacture of spirit for any potable purpose could not be defended, andordered that no more new spirit should be issued to the rectifiers for the production ofgin ; before this date, however, the quantities used for this purpose had been considerablyreduced.15. When the reduction in the output of alcohol was decided upon towards the endof February, 1917, the position of distilling in the Scotch and Irish pot-still distillerieswas carefully considered, and as a result it was decided to allow these distilleries tocomplete the licences for reduced quantities issued to them for the season 1916-1917,in view of the fact that at least two-thirds of the spirit had already been made, andthat the bulk of the grain required for the balance had been malted.(C.) The Present and Future Position.16. On the 10th May, 1917, in view of the altered circumstances, you directed theCommittee to consider and report as soon as possible upon the existing position, andissued revised terms of reference.17. The present position as regards supplies of spirit for war purposes and theessential industrial trades is as follows :&apos;-Proof gallonsper month.Production of the yeast distilleries..        .. .. .. ..    2,300,000Production from molasses .. .. .. ....      425,000. Supplies contracted for from Natal,. .. .. .. ..       50,000Total    .. .. .. .. .. - 2,775,000
18. The estimated monthly requirements under the principal heads for the next fewmonths are as follows : Per month.2,335,000135,00050,000Propulsive explosivesOther military purposes ..High explosives..Transport serviceIndustrial tradesMedical supplies and manufacturing chemists and druggists34,000621.50087,000Total    ........ 3,262,50019. When His Majesty&apos;s factory, Irvine, with a maximum output of 150 tons ofnitro-cellulose powder a week commences manufacture, which will probably take place inthe&apos; autumn of this year, the alcohol requirements will gradually increase up to anestimated additional 285,000 proof gallons a month.20. Certain steps are being taken to restrict the use of spirit in various industries,but the results in this direction are not likely to be material, as a large proportion of thealcohol consumed under this head is for services directly connected with the war.21. The figures for supplies as compared with requirements show a deficiency ofabout 500,000 proof gallons a month, and commencing from the late autumn of thisyear, the deficiency will gradually increase until it reaches the total of 785,000 proofgallons a month.(D.) Solvent Recovery^22. The estimates originally put before the Committee of the quantity of alcoholrequired for the manufacture of propulsive explosives was a gross figure without anyallowance for possible recovery.Acetone has been recovered for some years from the manufacture of cordite, theabsorbing liquids employed for the purpose being, in one type of plant, bisulphite ofsoda, and, in the other, water. Neither of these liquids is suitable for the recovery ofether and alcohol used in the manufacture of the present service propulsive explosiveknown as R.D.B. When a nitro-cellulose powder is manufactured the ether and alcoholare recovered either by means of refrigeration or by the use of sulphuric acid as theabsorbing liquid. Refrigeration cannot be used safely in the case of a nitro-glycerinepowder because of the condensation of nitro-glycerine, which would be a source of greatdanger. Sulphuric acid cannot be employed in the acetone recovery plants as theyexist at the factories in this country, and experiments and research were necessary inorder to arrive at a liquid capable of recovering the ether and alcohol from the airdrawn from the recovery stoves, and also capable of being used in existing recoveryplants. Creosol has been found suitable for the purpose, and a satisfactory recoveryhas been obtained with it in both natures of existing plants. These will require butslight modifications to adapt them and the alterations are well in hand. In thefigures given above for alcohol requirements allowance has been made for a recoverywhich the trials so far carried out indicate as probable. The recovery may be increasedwith experience, but at the present moment it would not be safe to calculate on ahigher recovery than that allowed for.(E.) Spirit from Yeast Distilleries.23. As stated above, alcohol is now only being produced in this country in theyeast and molasses distilleries. An increase in the yield of alcohol from the yeastdistilleries can only -be secured at the expense of the production of yeast. Thedistilleries have difficulty in meeting demands for yeast at the present time, althoughthey are working at full output. Even if this increase were effected the additionalquantities of alcohol realised would be small. Moreover, the Committee has beeninformed by the chairman that a committee which was recently appointed to considerquestions affecting the consumption of grain for yeast and for alcohol for munitions hasbeen in communication with the distillers and has impressed on them the necessity ofreducing the consumption of grain and the desirability of experiments with the viewof increasing the yield of yeast at the expense possibly of the yield of alcohol. Theobject in view is to obtain the maximum quantity of yeast per unit of cerealused under the altered conditions rendered possible by the relaxation of the exciseregulations granted by the Board of Customs and Excise, and in this way todiminish the consumption of grain in the production of yeast, and thereby save tonnage.
(F.)-Spirit from Molasses.24. The output of spirit from the molasses distilleries now working could hebrought up to 1,600,000 proof gallons a month if a sufficient supply of molasses wereavailable. The Three Mills Distillery at Bromley, at present silent, could produce anadditional 400,000 proof gallons a month. The present output of spirit from molasseshas been taken at 425,000 proof gallons a month, so that the reserve capacity of thesedistilleries is 1,575,000 proof gallons a month, or considerably in excess of the presentand prospective shortage.25. Molasses is also used in considerable quantities in the manufacture of cattlefoods, and it is estimated that from now to the end of the year 5,000 tons per monthare required for this purpose.26. The total quantity of molasses required for the 425,000 proof gallons of spiritnow being produced, as well as for the additional 500,000 proof gallons, and for cattlefeeding to the extent of 5,000 tons a month, amounts to 14,000 tons a month. Of thisquantity it is estimated that 4,000 tons a month will be available from the sugarrefineries for the months of May, June, and July, but that from August onwards theproduction will fall to about 2,000 tons a month owing to a change in the raw sugaravailable for refining. The quantity of molasses to be imported each month up to andincluding July is, therefore, 10,000 tons, and thereafter 12,000, until His Majesty&apos;sfactory, IrvineV requirements, estimated at 285,000 proof gallons a month, haveto be met. When this occurs a gradual increase will be necessary up to a total of14,850 tons per month.27. The molasses imported into Great Britain is shipped principally from Cuba,and is brought over in tank steamers specially fitted for the purpose.   The steamers atpresent in the service, and their carrying capacities, are : Tons.Beechwood         ..          ..          ..          ..          .. .

The -Committee has considered the question as to the available supplies ofalcohol from the Colonies, and attached (Appendix III) is a table showing approximatelythe quantities of spirit for the months from May to December inclusive and the estimatedtonnage required^This spirit is of too low a strength for immediate use, and would have to beredistilled on arrival, but the ultimate cost per proof gallon would not be excessive.(H.) Spirit from Bond.the stocks of spirit inProof gallons...&apos; 136,572,0004,080,000..     12,724,0001,014,000..   154,390,000These figures are &quot; original gauges,&quot; and the actual quantity at present may be10 per cent. less.30. The spirit in bond is widely distributed over the various distilleries and generalbonded warehouses throughout the country, in many cases in comparatively smallquantities in not easily accessible districts in Scotland and Ireland. If this spirit weredrawn pro rata considerable railway transport would be required, and much labourwould be necessary to handle it.[627] C29. The latest Board of Trade Return (April 1917) givesbond as follows : -Spirits, home-madeSpirits, foreign-BrandyRum (including imitation rum)All other sortsTotal ..
31. The value of young whiskey to the present holder is several times greater thanthe cost of raw spirit to the Government. The Government is now paying 3s. 3d. perproof gallon, while Colonial spirit is offered at Is. 6d. per proof gallon f.o.b.32. Of the spirit in bond rum is the cheapest. It is of higher strength and ismore accessible for redistillation purposes than the British spirit.Swmnary.1. The estimated monthly requirements for all purposes for the next few monthsare : 3,262,500 proof gallons.From the late autumn of 1917 this quantity will gradually increase up to anestimated monthly requirement of 3,547,500 proof gallons.2. By restricting the use of spirit in various industries of lesser national importancea limited reduction in requirements is possible.3. The present monthly production of spirit from the yeast distilleries and frommolasses, together with a quantity of 50,000 proof gallons contracted for in Natal,amounts to 2,755,000 proof gallons.4. The monthly deficiency to be met, therefore, for the next few months is say 500,000 proof gallons,gradually increasing to 785,000 proof gallons.5. The figures for requirements are based on a recovery of solvent in themanufacture of propulsive explosives, which from experience so far available appearsreasonably probable.6. The problem of the recovery of an ether alcohol solvent from a powder containingnitro-glycerine is a new one ; the results so far obtained may be regarded as satisfactory,but the matter is being actively followed up by experts so as to obtain the best possiblerecovery.7. Increased supplies of spirit from the yeast distilleries could only be secured atthe expense of yeast, but without any corresponding reduction in the amount of grainconsumed. With the object of reducing the consumption of grain in the production ofyeast, experiments are being made at the distilleries to obtain the maximum.quantity ofyeast per unit of cereal, which, if successful, would result in a diminished outputof spirit.8. If molasses are available, the output of the molasses distilleries now workingcould be brought up to 1,600,000 proof gallons a month (they are now producing about450,000 proof&apos;lgallons a month), so that the present deficiency of 500,000 gallons couldbe easily met from these distilleries. After allowing for home production, the totaltonnage required for the necessary molasses for the manufacture of spirit and for cattlefeeding (estimated at 5,000 tons a month), would be 10,000 tons a month up to andincluding July, and thereafter 12,000 tons a month.This quantity will have to be gradually increased to 14,850 tons a month asHis Majesty&apos;s factory, Irvine&apos;s,. production of nitro-cellulose powder develops. Shouldthere be a reduced output from the yeast distilleries as indicated in parapraph 7 above,this could be compensated for by a still further increase from molasses.The quantities of spirit for which firm offers have been received from the Coloniesand the tonnage required for shipping to this country are as follows : Month.

Recommendations.The deficiency in the quantity of spirit to meet the requirements enumerated inparagraph 18 of the Report can be met, on the evidence before the Committee, in threedifferent ways, as follows : 1. By increasing production from molasses.2. By importation of spirit from the colonies.3. By the withdrawal of spirit from bond.After having carefully considered these three alternatives the Committee is ofopinion that the proper course to pursue w^ould be to increase the output of molassesspirit by augmenting the quantity of molasses now available for distilling. Theincreased supplies of molasses for this purpose can be provided by keeping the five tanksteamers now used for the purpose constantly on the service and, as the quantitiesrequired incrcease, by the addition of one or more steamers as may be necessary,These steamers are of no value as food carriers. If the full quantity of molassesestimated for cattle feeding is not required the tonnage for molasses for distilling willbe proportionately increased. An increase in the production of molasses from theBritish sugar refineries would do much to assist the position ; this could be effected bynot issuing raw sugar to the public.The importation of spirit from the colonies would only in part meet the deficiency,and would mean freight room, which if not jised in this way would be available forbringing food to the country. Further, owing to the fact that the spirit would not beup to the strength required it would on arrival have to be conveyed to variousdistilleries for redistillation, which would involve transport labour and a certain loss ofspirit.The withdrawal of spirit from bond and its redistillation is not recommended forthe following reasons : 1. The present high market value of the spirit.2. The amount of labour involved in collecting the spirit pro rata from the variousholders and the amount of railway transport required to convey it to^the distilleries.3. The additional cost and the loss involved in bringing the spirit up to strength.4. Taking over the stock of British spirit in bond for munitions purposes wouldundoubtedly seriously affect the distilling industry of the country, and would entailserious financial difficulties in view of the enormous sum of money which is investedin the trade.We have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servants,F.

Appendix II.Advisory Committee on Alcohol Supplies for War Purposes.Summary of the Committee^ Views on Memorandum from the Royal Society on the&quot; Provision of Alcohol for the Manufacture of Munitions.&quot;1. Potable Spirit in Bond.This is of low strength, and would have to be redistilled before it could be employedin place of the strong spirit which alone can be used for national services in connectionwith the war. The bonded stocks have passed from seller to purchaser, in many casesa number of times, and the price that might have to be paid for the spirit now wouldbe altogether out of proportion to its true value. The use, therefore, of the bondedstores of whiskey can only be regarded as a measure to be adopted as a last resource.It seems inevitable that the distilleries producing yeast (which furnish a largeproportion of strong spirit) should continue to use foodstuffs, as the British distilleriesare now meeting 75 per cent, of the national requirements of yeast. The grainprincipally used is maize, barley, and rye, and it must be remembered that the grain soused is not entirely lost as a &quot; foodstuff,&quot; as the draff and grains provide a cattle foodwhich farmers, &amp;c, consider of value. &apos;2. The Use of Diseased Potatoes.Potatoes and root crops are not used in the United Kingdom for the production ofalcohol, and existing distilleries are not fitted with plant capable of dealing with thesematerials; the installation of such plant at the present time would be costly, anddelivery would be slow.The necessary practical experience in manufacturing from root crops would have tobe gained.   This would also take time.The difficulties attaching to the collection of the diseased potatoes from all over thecountry, the labour involved, the great expense of carriage, and the additional strainon already overworked railways, all point to the impracticability of the proposal putforward.January 12, 1917.
