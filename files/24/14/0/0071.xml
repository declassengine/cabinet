Lt UFrom Viceroy, Foreign Department, 26th May 1917.(Repeated to Aden and Cairo as 655 S.)(Received at India Office, 9 a.m., 27th.)Secret. Aden. Aden telegram, 36G A.P., 23rd May. Our experience ofMavia and southern Arabs&apos; attitude generally makes us still doubtful ofsincerity of confederacy&apos;s first objective being to oust Turkish, troops, nor dowe see how they can effect this without guns. Moreover, their plan ofcampaign based on Hodeida or Shukra Mokalla, which involves transport bysea, is difficult to comprehend.We have sounded note of warning regarding Imam, whose only fault hasbeen that he has refused to break faith with Turks while remaining neutraltowards ourselves. As regards Italy we trust that mere apprehension ofItalian intervention will not again be allowed to force us into a questionableundertaking. Could not some understanding regarding Southern Arabianow be arrived at direct with the Italian Government so as to obviate futureapprehensions of this kind ?We recognise that Resident must be best judge of sincerity and value ofthis confederacy, but before using such a questionable catspaw we thinkthat all possible consequences should be considered. If we support it and itfails we shall have Imam an active enemy instead of neutral, and our creditstill further lowered. Present position at Aden, though unsatisfactory, istolerable, and can, we think, best be solved either by ourselves whenreinforcements are available or in general peace settlement at the end ofwar. We think that Resident might reply to confederacy that it is contraryto declared policy of the Government to take sides in inter-Arab quarrels,but that if confederacy thinks that they can satisfy him that their firstobjective is to expel Turks, and that with our assistance there is a reasonableprospect of their doing so successfully he is prepared to discuss matters atAden with leaders.
