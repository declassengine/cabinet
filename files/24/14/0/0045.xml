To the Right Honourable D. Lloyd George, M.P., Prime Minister.Sir,We have the honour to submit the following Interim Report on Joint StandingIndustrial Councils.2. The terms of reference to the Sub-Committee are: &quot; (1) To make and consider suggestions for securing a permanent improve-ment in the relations between employers and workmen.&quot; (2) To recommend means for securing that industrial conditions affectingthe relations between employers and workmen shall be systematically reviewedby those concerned, with a view to improving conditions in the future.&quot;3. After a general consideration of our duties in relation to the matters referredto us, we decided first to address ourselves to the problem of establishing permanentlyimproved relations between employers and employed in the main industries of thecountry, in which there exist representative organisations on both sides. The presentreport accordingly deals more especially with these trades. We are proceeding withthe consideration of the problems connected with the industries which are less wellorganised.4. We appreciate that under the pressure of the war both employers and work-people and their organisations are very much pre-occupied, but, notwithstanding, webelieve it to be of the highest importance that our proposals should be put beforethose concerned without delay, so that employers and employed may meet in the nearfuture and discuss the problems before them.5. The circumstances of the present time are admitted on all sides to offer agreat opportunity for securing a permanent improvement in the relations betweenemployers and employed, while failure to utilise the opportunity may involve thenation in grave industrial difficulties at the end of the war.It is generally allowed that the war almost enforced some reconstruction ofindustry, and in considering the subjects referred to us we have kept in view the needfor securing in the development of reconstruction the largest possible measure ofco-operation between employers and employed.In the interests of the community it is vital that after the- war the co-operation ofall classes, established during the war, should continue, and more especially withregard to the relations between employers and employed. For securing improvementin the latter, it is essential that any proposals put forward should offer to workpeoplethe means of attaining improved conditions of employment and a higher standardof comfort generally, and involve the enlistment of their active and continuousco-operation in the promotion of industry.To this end, the establishment for each industry of. an organisation, representativeof employers and workpeople, to have as its object the regular consideration ofmatters affecting the progress and well-being of the trade from the point of view ofall those engaged in it, so far as this is consistent with the general interest of thecommunity, appears to us necessary.6. Many complicated problems have arisen during the war which have a bearingboth on employers and workpeople, and may affect the relations between them. It isclear that industrial conditions will need careful handling if grave difficulties andstrained relations are to be avoided after the war has ended. The precise nature ofthe problems to be faced naturally varies from industry to industry, and even frombranch to branch within the same industry. Their treatment consequently willneed an intimate knowledge of the facts and circumstances of each trade, and suchknowledge is to be found only among those directly connected with the trade.7. With a view to providing means for carrying out the policy outlined above,we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should propose without delay to thevarious associations of employers and employed the formation of Joint StandingIndustrial Councils in the several industries, where they do not already exist,composed of representatives of employers and employed, regard being paid to thevarious sections of the industry and the various classes of labour engaged.
8. The appointment of a Chairman or Chairmen should, we think, be left to theCouncil who may decide that these should be (1) A Chairman for each side of the Council;(2) A Chairman and Vice-Ghairman selected from the members of theCouncil (one from each side of the Council);(3) A Chairman chosen by the Council from independent persons outsidethe industry ; or:(4) A Chairman nominated by such person or authority as the Council\may determine or, failing agreement, by the Government.9. The Council should meet at regular and frequent intervals.10. The objects to which the consideration of the Councils should be directedshould be appropriate matters affecting the several industries and particularly theestablishment of a closer co-operation between employers and employed. Questionsconnected with demobilisation will call for early attention.11. One of the chief factors in the problem, as it at first presents itself, consistsof the guarantees given by the Government, with Parliamentary sanction, and thevarious undertakings entered into by employers, to restore the Trade Union rulesand customs suspended during the war. While this does not mean that all thelessons learnt during the war should be ignored, it does mean that the definiteco-operation and acquiescence by both employers and employed must be a conditionof any setting aside of these guarantees or undertakings, and that, if new arrange-ments are to be reached, in themselves more satisfactory to all parties but not instrict accordance with the guarantees, they must be the joint work of employers andemployed.12. The matters to be considered by the Councils must inevitably differ widelyfrom industry to industry, as different circumstances and conditions call for differenttreatment, but we are of opinion that the suggestions set forth below ought to betaken into account, subject to such modification in each case as may serve to adaptthem to the needs of the various industries.13. In the well-organised industries, one of the first questions to be consideredshould be the establishment of local and works organisations to supplement and makemore effective the work of the central bodies. It is not enough to secure co-operationat the centre between che national organisations ; it is equally necessary to enlist theactivity and support of employers and employed in the districts and in individualestablishments. The National Industrial Council should not be regarded as completein itself; what is needed is a triple organisation-in the workshops, the districts,and nationally. Moreover, it is essential that the organisation at each of these threestages should proceed on a common principle, and that the greatest measure ofcommon action between them should be secured.14. With this end in view, we are of opinion that the following proposals shouldbe laid before the National Industrial Councils : -(a) That District Councils, representative of the Trade Unions and of theEmployers&apos; Association in the industry, should be created, or developed out ofthe existing machinery for negotiation in the various trades.(6) That Works Committees, representative of the management and of theworkers employed, should be instituted in particular works to act in closeco-operation with the district and national machinery.As it is of the highest importance that the scheme making provision for theseCommittees should be such as to secure the support of the Trade Unions andEmployers&apos; Associations concerned, its design should be a matter for agreementbetween these organisations.Just as regular meetings and continuity of co-operation are essential in the caseof the National Industrial Councils, so they seem to be necessary in the case of thedistrict and works organisations. The object is to secure co-operation by granting toworkpeople a greater share in the consideration of matters affecting their industiy,and this can only be achieved by keeping employers and workpeople in constanttouch.15. The respective  unctions of Works Committees, District Councils, andNational Councils will no doubt require to be determined separately in accordancewith the varying conditions of different industries. Care will need to be taken ineach case to delimit accurately their respective functions, in order to avoid overlapping2582 A 2
and resulting friction... For instance, where.conditions of employment are. determinedby national agreements, the District Councils or Works Committees should not beallowed to contract out of conditions so laid down, nor, where conditions aredetermined by local agreements, should, such power be allowed to Works Committees.16. Among the questions with which it is suggested that the National Councilsshould deal or allocate to District Councils or Works Committees the following mayhe selected for special mention: (i) The better utilisation of the practical knowledge and experience ofthe workpeople.(ii) Means for securing to the workpeople a greater share in andresponsibility for the determination and observance of the conditions underwhich their work is carried on.(iii) The settlement of the general principles governing the conditions ofemployment, including the methods of fixing, paying, and readjusting wages,having regard to. the need for securing to the workpeople a share in theincreased prosperity of the industry.(iv) The establishment of regular methods of negotiation for issuesarising between employers and workpeople, with a view both to the preventionof differences, and to their better adjustment when they appear.(v) Means of ensuring to the workpeople the greatest possible security ofearnings and employment, without undue restriction upon change of occupationor employer,(vi) Methods of fixing and adjusting earnings, piecework prices, &amp;c, andof dealing with the many difficulties which arise with regard to the methodand amount of payment apart from the fixing of general standard rates, whichare already covered by paragraph (iii).(vii) Technical education and training.(viii) Industrial research and the full utilisation of its results.(ix) The provision of facilities for the full consideration and utilisationof inventions and improvement designed by workpeople, and for the adequatesafeguarding of the rights of the designers of such improvements.(x) Improvements of processes, machinery and organisation and appro-priate questions relating to management and the examination of industrialexperiments, with special reference to co-operation in carrying new ideas intoeffect and full consideration of the workpeople&apos;s point of view in relation tothem.(xi) Proposed legislation affecting the industry.17. The methods by which the functions of the proposed Councils should becorrelated to those of joint bodies in the different districts, and in the various workswithin the districts, must necessarily vary according to the trade. It may, therefore,be the best policy to leave it to the trades themselves to formulate schemes suitableto their special circumstances, it being understood that it is essential to secure ineach industry the fullest measure of co-operation between employers and employed,both generally, through the National Councils, and specifically, through districtCommittees and workshop Committees.18. It would seem advisable that the Government should put the proposalsrelating to National Inohistrial Councils before the employers&apos; and workpeoples&apos;associations and request them to adopt such measures as are needful for theirestablishment where they do not already exist. Suitable steps should also be taken,at the proper time, to put the matter before the general public.19. In forwarding the proposals to the parties concerned, we think the Governmentshould offer to be represented in an advisory capacity at the preliminary meetings ofa Council, if the parties so desire. We are also of opinion that the Governmentshould undertake to supply to the various Councils such information on industrialsubjects as may be available and likely to prove of value.20. It has been suggested that means must be devised to safeguard the interestsof the community against possible action of an anti-social character on the part of theCouncils. We have, however, here assumed that the Councils, in their work ofpromoting the interests of their own industries, will have regard for the Nationalinterest. If they fulfil their functions they will be the best builders of nationalprosperity. The State never parts with its inherent over-riding power, but suchpower may be least needed when least obtruded.
21. It appears to us that it may be desirable at some later stage for the State togive the sanction of law to agreements made by the Councils, but the initiative in thisdirection should come from the Councils themselves.22. The plans sketched in the foregoing paragraphs are applicable in the form inwhich they are given only to industries in which there are responsible associations ofemployers and workpeople which can claim to be fairly representative. The caseof the less well-organised trades or sections of a trade necessarily needs further con-sideration. We hope to be in a position shortly to put forward recommendations thatwill prepare the way for the active utilisation in these trades of the same practicalco-operation as is foreshadowed in the proposals made above for the more highly-organised trades.23. It may be desirable to state here our considered opinion that an essentialcondition of securing a permanent improvement in the relations between employersand employed is that there should be adequate organisation on the part of bothemployers and workpeople. The proposals outlined for joint co-operation throughoutthe several industries depend for their ultimate success upon there being suchorganisation on both sides; and such organisation is necessary also to providemeans whereby the arrangements and agreements made for the industry may beeffectivelv carried out.24. We have thought it well to refrain from making suggestions or offeringopinions with regard to such matters as profit-sharing, co-partnership, or particularsystems of wages, &amp;c. It would be impracticable for us to make any useful generalrecommendations on such matters, having regard to the varying conditions in differenttrades. We are convinced, moreover, that a permanent improvement in the relationsbetween employers and employed must be founded upon something other than a cashbasis. What is wanted is that the workpeople should have a greater opportunity ofparticipating in the discussion about and adjustment of those parts of industry bywhich they are most affected.25. The schemes recommended in this Report are intended not merely for thetreatment of industrial problems when they have become acute, but also, and moreespecially, to prevent their becoming acute. We believe that regular meetings todiscuss industrial questions, apart from and prior to any differences with regard tothem that may have begun to cause friction, will materially reduce the number ofoccasions on which, in the view of either employers or employed, it is necessary tocontemplate recourse to a stoppage of work.26. We venture to hope that representative men in eacn industry, with pride intheir calling and care for its place as a contributor to the national well-being, willcome together in the manner here suggested, and apply themselves to promotingindustrial harmony and efficiency and removing the obstacles that have hitherto stoodin the way.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,J.

R1XONSTRUCTIOW COMICS.Sub-Committee on Relations between ^nployers and employed,Interim Report on Joint Standing Industrial Councils.questions put by thei.-ages and Dnploymentpanel of tho Reconstruc-tion Cornmittec.Replies of theSub-Committee.In what classes of Industriesdocs the Interim Reportpropose that IndustrialCouncil shall be establish-ed?     uhat basis of classifi-cation has the Sub-Committeein view?1.1.   It has been suggested that,forthe purpose of considering theestablishment of IndustrialCouncils, or other bodies designed to assist in the improvementof relations between employersand employed, the various in-dustries should be grouped intothree classes - (A) industriesin which organisation on thepart of employers and employedis sufficiently developed torender the Councilsrepresentative.      (B)industries in which either asregards employers and employed,or both, the degree oforganisation, though consider-able, is less marked than in (A)and is insufficient to beregarded as representative; and(C) industries in whichorganisation is so imperfect,either as regards employers oremployed,
the fliachj^ery--proposedended to be in additionor in substitution forsting machinery?   Is itPosed that existing mach-ry should be superseded?&quot;listing machinery&quot; - isConciliation Boards andother organisations for2*employed, or both, that noAssociations can be saidadequately to represent thoseengaged In the trade.It will be clear that ananalysis of industries will showa number which are on the borderlines between these&quot; groups andspecial consideration will haveto be given to such trades.     Sofar as groups (A) and (G) areconcerned, a fairly large numberof trades can readily be assignedto them; group (B) is necessarilymore indeterminate.For trades in group (A) theCommittee have proposed theestablishment of Joint StandingIndustrial Councils in theseveral trades.     In dealing with&quot; tho various industries it may benecessary to consider spe-cially th;case of parts of industries ingroup (A) where organisation isnot fully developed.In most organised trades there al-ready exist joint bodies forparticular purposes.   It is notproposed that the IndustrialCouncils should necessarily disturbthese existing bodies.   A Councilwould be free, if it chose and ifthe bodies concerned approved, tomerge existing Committees &amp;c, inthe Council or to link them
[nt conference and discussioniween Employers and ijnploycd.[jf understood that membor-p of the Councils is to befined to representatives elect-by Employers1 Associations andde Unions?   &apos;.,hat is tho vlow of0 Sub-Committee regarding the;.ry cf new organisationstablished after the Councilsvg been set up?Is it intended that decisionsched by the Councils shall bedins upon the bodies comprisingJin?  If so, is such binding effectbe conditional upon the consent^ach Employers1 Association orJqo Union affected?with the Council as Sub-Committees.3.     It is intended that theCouncils should be composedonly of representatives ofTrade Unions and Employers1Associations, and that neworganisations should beadmitted only with theapproval of the particularside of the Council ofwhich the organisationswould form a part.4.    (a) It is contemplated thatagreements reached byIndustrial Councils should(whilst nottif coursepossessing the bindingforoe of law) carry withthem the same obligationsof observance as exists inthe case of other agreementsbetween Employers&apos;Associations and Trade UnionsA Council, being on itsworkmen&apos;s side based onthe Trade Unions concernedin the Industry, its powersor authority could only besuch as the constituentTrade Unions freely agreedto.
(b)   In particular, is itintended that all pledges giveneither by the Government or liplcyers for the restoration3f trade union rules and practicesafter the War shall be redeemedwithout qualification unless theparticular Trade Union con-cerned agrees to alteration; orfcn the contrary that the Indus t-rial Council shall have power to--decide such question by aiajcrity vote of the workmen&apos;sepresentatlves from all thefrade Unions in the industry.(b)     It is clearly intended thatall pledges relating to therestoration of Trade Union rulesshall be redeemed withoutqualification unless the particu-lar Trade Union concerned agreesto alteration; and it is notintended that the Council shallhave power to decide such questior.by a majority vote of the workmen&apos;representatives from all the TradeUnions in the industry.
SUGGiuojuSD IRQC^DUBti OH TH&amp; IaT^RIk KaPORTMemorandum, by Mr, Montagu.I suggest to my colleagues that the procedure tobe adopted in this case requires extremely careful consideration.I would propose to suggest to the Prime Minister the following.*course:-1,   A series of small conferences should, be arrangedby the Prime Minister,  or some one appointed by him to acton his behalf, with trade unionists and with employers todiscuss the general principles of the Report, the method ofprocedure, and the difficulties to be overcome.       I attachgroat importance to Mrs. Wbb&apos;s contention (see her memoran-d-uixi) that some basis of joint action must be secured in thecase of industries where a number of trade unions occupiedthe ground, and I should hope that some progress might bemade towards the solution of this difficulty as a result ofthe proposed conferences.2.   As a general undertaking wa3 given by the Governmentthat Trade Union rules should be restored at the end of theWar. the Government must be a party to all agreements betweenEmployers and Trade Unions affecting restoration.       It isaccordingly suggested that conclusions reached between Employers&apos;Associations and Trade Unions should be approved by the Govern-ment before they are made binding upon the signatories,
3.   The Prime Minister on behalf of the Governmentshould:-(a) re-affirm in such terms as he may thinkproper the Government pledge to theTrade Unions;(b) state that the proposals contained in thereport are of limited application and notintended at most as more than a small instal-iiient of policy;(c) outline the suggested method for putting thereconr-iendations of the interim report intooperation.4.   As regards sub-section (c).. in the preceding para-graph,  it seems fairly   clear that the Government Departmentconcerned with the ^working of the industrial councils mustbe the Ministry of Labour but,  for the smooth and effectiveworking of what will be an extremely delicate and complicatedtask,  it may, and I think it will be, advisable to set upwithin the Ministry a sub-section to deal with the industrialcouncils.     It might consist, in the first instance, of twoSecretaries with a small Advisory Committee, and their moreimportant functions would be:-(i) To advise industrial councils where nec-essary and to make available experienceslikely to be of service to them; and(ii) to collate the recommendations of thecouncils in regard to Trade Union pledges.I shall be glad to receive as soon as possibleany observations which my colleagues may desire to makeas I am anxious to present the Report to the Prime Ministerwithout undue delay.
