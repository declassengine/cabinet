?ifmkSWMkia OF BLOCKADE IKFOAI&amp;TIOEMay 18-25, 1917*On being informed by the Danish Minister atBerlin that Denmark must gradually reduce her exportsof agricultural produce to Germany, in consequence ofthe submarine blockade, the German Government repliedthat this intimation was equivalent to a threat, andthat the German forces on the frontier would probablybe strengthened as a measure of precaution.The live-stock census of Feb. 20 has yielded thefollowing figures:-   Horses, colts and foals, 538,000in Jutland);   Cattle, calves and heifers, 2,452,000(61$ in Jutland);   Pigs, 1,980,000 (&amp;Z$ in Jutland);Sheep and Lambs 268,000.   i&apos;hese figures are considerablysmaller &quot;than those of July 1914;   but show an improvement(except in the case of pigs) since February 1916*The cooperative bacon factories state that theycannot maintain their trade with the United Kingdomunless they are relieved of the cost of freight and insur-ance and are guaranteed the necessary supplies of coal,oil etc.   The April arrivals of Banish bacon in theUnited Kingdom amounted to 15,940 tone.For the moment the commerce and manufactures ofDenmark are almost entirely at a standstill.   Until theend of 1916 they were reaping abnormal profits from thewar.i5hs produce boats &quot;Storebelt&quot; and &quot;Clara&quot; have beenput into the German Prize-Court;   and three other Danishvessels, outward bound from Denmark in ballast, wereseized by the Germans between the 15th and the 17th inst.
Two o  these were sailing to fetch coal from theUnited Kingdom;   the third was to load for the Unitedkingdom in a Norwegian port.    The Danes have decidednot to open negotiations with us concerning theirmerchant tonnage until they are more clearly informedas to Germany*s intentions.Steps have been taken by B.M. Government to suboend the importation of fertilisers and of margarinematerials into Denmark,The Swedish Government are apparently notanxious to ratify the draft Anlo-Swedish Agreement,and we shall not be displeased if it lapses throughtheir inaction.     The United States are in a positionto insist upon all the transit facilities whichRussia can reasonably require from Sweden,Swedish emergency legislation becomes moredrastic every day.     On May 20. over thirty itemswere added to the list of prohibited exports.   Swedishfishermen have been forbidden to land their catch atforeign ports.     Embargoes have been impored on theexisting stocks of Maize, Bice. Copper, Lead, Tin,Hides, Skins and Sole Leather.But, since Sweden has chosen to be dependentupon Germany for coal and   since Germany insists oncompensation for all coal supplies, there is a markedincrease in the exports from Sweden to Germany ofiron, steel, ferro-silicon, machinery, woodptilp andiron ore.     Germany, it is expected, will receive moreSwedish iron ore in 1917 than in any previous year.
- 3 -gOBIAX&apos; spite of our elaborate arrangements to ensurethat only the well-affected eanners should receiveimported tin-plates, olive ofcl and tomato pulp, theNorwegian exports of canned goods to Germany we re t in1916, no less than 20,000 tons,   Germany has been ableto supply the necessary black plates for this trade;   andthe c an lie r s whom we boycotted have found home-madesubstitutes for olive oil and tomato-pulp.   Unless wecan come to terms with the black-listed canners -   andthis can hardly be done except by purchasing their out-put -   it is probable that Germany will continue toreceive large supplies of canned fish from Norway.Germany has undertaken to supply Norway with5,000 tons of iron a month, bat has raised her prices by50,1* and has not promised any materials for shipbuilding.The amount to be supplied is small as compared withthose which have been promised to Denmark and to Sweden.The nature of the compensation to be given by Norwayhas not been disclosed.The Norwegian Government have obtained assurancesthat Sweden will not attack Norway in the event of a warbetween Norway and Germany.Our negotiations with the Norwegian Ship Ownersstill hang fire.   Apparently the main obstacle to anagreement is the faint-heartedness of the NorwegianMinistry, without whose assistance it would be difficultfor us to secure a sufficient quantity of Norwegiantonnage within a reasonable time.
4. gSTHERLAHDS. We have placed an embargo on farther importsinto Holland of Vegetable Seeds, Dried Blood andMachinery for drying Vegetables.Sir Walter Townley has informed the Batch Ministerfor Foreign Affairs that we propose to requisitioncertain Dutch vessels in which British capital isinvested, since they could not otherwise be equippedwith defensive armament.    M. Loudon armears to regardthis as a reasonable measure.5. SPAII. The Spanish Government offer to accept a revisedform of the Cortina Agreement which they have thera-selves prepared.     The offer follows upon a plain hintfrom the United States that American supplies of ooaletc, would not be forthcoming if Spain attempted toevade her obligations to Great Britain.6. SWITZERLAND,, Under the new German-Swiss Agreement Germanywill receive 8,000 head of Swiss oattie $Including1,000 prise bulls) during the summer and autumn.7. GSKMAg SUPPLIES.     Becent reports on enemy material captured inFrance shows that there is an acute shortage of leatherfor boots and machine belting, of electrical material(telephones, field-cables); of railway waggons; ofiron and steel.     Rations were reduced by an order ofApril 13;   and the strictest economy in the drawing ofrations has been prescribed.     The soldiers reo iveinstead of coffee a substitute made from roastedhusks.     In one case at least the usual oat ration forhorses has been reduced by more than 75^. the deficiencybeing made good with Maize and Fleischfutterraehl.
IJ8.   UillT&amp;D SfAfSSi    It appears that the United states Governmentare willing to cooperate closely with us in s policyof compelling neutrals to maintain their exports to theUnited Kingdom and to reduce their exports to Germany,The existing rations of certain commodities to certainneutral states are considered., at Washington, to he un-duly generous, and the United States will assistus in securing reductions.      They will also insistupon the active employment of neutral tonnagewhich is at present lying idle.    They will withholdAmerican coal from neutral ships which attempt toevede our hunker control.9.   SOUTH jftMBKIQA.        The Argentine Government refuse to letus have more than the 200,000 tons of wheatwhich they have aLready conceded, and insist uponreceiving in due course an equivalent supply ofwheat from Australia.It is anticipate&amp; that, when the Braziliandeclaration of neutrality has &quot;been rescinded, theGerman ships in Brazilian waters will he seized bythe Brazilian Government, and the Allies will bepermitted to use Brazilian ports as naval bases.i10.
