20 209ft   TOB&amp;COO COMBQL.^fe^The War Cabinet in February approved a recommendationof the Imports Hestriotion Oommittee that the restriction onthe import of tobacco should he made more stringent, and inparticular that th*e special arrangement under which theBritish American Tobacco Company were allowed to import20,000 tons of tobacco for export on neutral ships of theGarland line in return for certain undertakings should be modi-fied so as to reduce tbe weight of tobacco to 10,000 tons.All arrangements have been made by the Board of Trade togive effect to these recommendations, but action has beenheld up at the request of the Foreign Office in view of the loannegotiations in the United States.   It is now understood thatthe Foreign Office after communication with Mr. Balfour nolonger think it necessary to delay giving effect to the restrlc-tion, and as all licences expire at the end of Mayr and thetrade is in a complete state of uncertainty as to its future,it is clearly necessary to delay no longer.After careful consideration of the position of stocks andconsumption and after consultation with the trade, the Boardof Trade think it possible to confine imports during the nexttobacco season to the 10,000 tons already mentioned (for whichmore than an equivalent in tonnage for carrying essential goodsis secured as a quid pro quo) together with a limited amount(say another 10,000 tons) of special kinds of tobacco of waichthe stocks are low.   This would enable a saving of over 50,000tons of imports to be effected as compared with 1916.But in order to do this it will be necessary to take con*trol of stocks, and to regulate the supply released to manu-facturers, so as to ensure that stocks shall last as long aspossible.  At present (very roughly) there are 100,000 tons Oftobacco in bond, and an unknown but relatively small      ofamount en which duty J*as been paid.  Today consumption isabout
about 80, OOO,tons a year including the Army overseas and theNavy who together require 15,000 tors per annum.    It would notin any case be proposed to curtail their consumption.   If there-   jfore stocks be regulated so that each manufacturer is limited to1the amount of his 1916 output the supply would be sufficient toend the tobacco year (June 1917 to June 1918) with a stock equalto 5 or $ months&apos; consumption to carry over.    This is on theassumption that the amounts to be imported all safely arrive.It may of course be found desirable hereafter to limit consump-ttion more strictly, but it seems best on all grounds to proceedvery gradually as otherwise we might be confronted with the samekind of difficulties in regulating distribution as have been metwith in the case, of sugar, i  It is further to be remembered thata drastic limitation of consumption would raise a serious revenueQuestion as well as causing great discontent.  The great thing isto bring consumption under control and to create the necessarymachinery, so as to have the matter well in hand s-hould it befound desirable to impose further restrictions.The Board of Trade have already full power to deal with thematter under the Defence of the Realm Regulations and they pro-pose at once to issue an Order taking control of stocks oftOiiacco,providing&apos; for the regulation of supplies to manufacturersand limiting the increase of wholesale and retail prices.   Thelatter power is necessary to prevent profiteering through the en-hancement of prices of stock, and it is proposed to limit pricesfor the present to those generally ruling to-day except with theconsent of the Board of Trade.It is proposed to set up a small Control Committeo consist-ing of Mr.Lancelot Hugh Smith, (Chaixman) f Major Towle of theQuartermaster General1 s Department, and Air.Gerard Bevan, whowill be assisted by an Advisory Committee representing the trade.A.
