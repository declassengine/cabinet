5 EC R E TOPERATIONS17From:-   General Barter.To:-C.I.G.S.May 21st, 1917.5 p.m.Nr.1057.Large Conference composed of officers and men representingtroops on whole front, was opened last night by Alexieff toconsider present state of Army.   Alexieff pointed out in veryeloquent and straight-forward speech, grave existing conditionof discipline, and, disassociating his appeal from considerationsof a political nature, exhorted the army to halt on the edge ofthe&apos; precipice into which one further step would throw them.A fine speech was also made by the C.G.S., who made agood point by saying that a dishonourable peace was the projectof the late Government, and should net be contemplated bypresent Government.He also protested vigorously against conduct which wouldbe treachery to Russia&apos;s allies who were fighting so bravely.Both speeches were very favourably received by soldiersas well as officers, and loud cheers were given for represent-atives of allies&apos; missions.It remains to be seen whether committees of delegates ofsoldiers and executive will allow the speeches to appear inpress and how they themselves will entertain them.&apos;Further information regarding effect and result of thisinitial and venturesome proceeding will be forwarded as soonas it comes to hand.
