S EC R EG.T. - 880WAR CABINET.THE RESELL I OK&quot; PRISONERS.1, JOHN MCNEILL was head of the Irish Volunteers,  themilitant body which seceded from Mr. Redmond&apos;s NationalistVolunteers.     He directed its training end operations untilthe day before the Rebellion, and then exerted himself topresent the armed rising that had been resolved upon by Pearseand Connelly.     He was convicted upon proof of his complicityin the organisation of the forces which were engaged in theRebellion, and is undergoing a sentence of penal servitudefor life.2. THE COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ   was second in command of thearmed rebel force which held Stephens Green and she was nodoubt responsible in this way for the various homicides whichtook place there.     The court martial which condemned her tookevidence only of her acting in a position of authority, and ofher surrender with a numerous body of rebels who had beenunder her command.      Sentence:      penal servitude for life.3. AUSTIN SLACK and CORNELIUS COLLINS   were principalorganisers of the rising in Kerry which was timed to takeadvantage of the intended landing of German arms, and theywere apparently in communication with Casement.      Sentence:penal servitude for life.4. About fifty men are undergoing sentence of penalservitude in respect of their part in the rebellion in Dublin.Eight, with sentences varying from three to ten years, wereamong the garrison at the Post Office.      There is little
.  P Lground for discrimination among them.     They include CountPlunketfs two sons, John and George,  little more than hoys,whose sentences are of ten years each.     Nearly twenty men,with sentences varying from three years to ten,  surrenderedat the Four Courts.     Most of them have ten years sentences;seven men were taken in the fighting at the South Dublin UnionWorkhouse premises, which they had seized;    one ringleader isundergoing a, ten years&apos;  sentence, five a three years&apos; sentenceand. one a five years&apos; sentence.      Six men are undergoing tenyears sentences, and one a life sentence who were among themen fighting at Jacob&apos;s Biscuit Factory.     Fourteen are under-going three years sentences in respect of the fighting at theMendicity Institution, Dublin.     These several places wereextensive buildings into which the rebel forces were thrownby their leaders early in the rebellion, and it is said thechoice of positions showed much strategic judgment.      Thedefence and reduction of each post cost a good many lives onboth sides.     None of the men here mentioned were leaders inthe Rebellion.     Most of them were men who, having becomemembers of a disciplined, armed force, merely did as theywere ordered by their immediate commanders.       Speakinggenerally they behaved in a manner which,, among troops law-fully commissioned, would be considered orderly and humane.At the Post Office there was one bad incident of men who v/ereset at liberty and fired upon from behind,  but no man now inprison is identified by the evidence as having been party tothis piece of cowardice.      The sentences as a whole shew anunevenness which is not explained by the evidence.     For thesame degree of participation in the rebellion men receivedsentences which, after commutation by the G.O.C. remain atthree, five, eight and ten years of penal servitude.
Among the prisoners from the Dublin fighting a man ofAmerican birth named Edward da Valera, who was a colonel inthe Irish Volunteers,  and a prominent Dublin town Councillornamed Cosgrave, are under sentence for life.     They were inresponsible positions.     Another Dublin Councillor calledPartridge has a sentence of ten years penal servitude.      Ithink it doubtful if he had any   premeditated part in thefighting and he declared that he had not.James Joyce, a shopman, who went with an armed party andseized his master&apos;s shop,  is the only man among the Dublinrebels who can be said, to be in prison for anything elsethan armed rebellion.      None of the prisoner?, was identifiedas having been personally and individually guilty of homicide.Eight prisoners are undergoing sentences in respect offighting which took place at Ashbourne in County Dublin, whena large body of rebels fought a pitched battle with a partyof the Royal Irish Constabulary and killed and woundedseveral of them.      Thomas Ashe,  a ringleader,  is under sentencefor life.     Richard Hayes who served with the rebels as asurgeon suffered a twenty years sentence, two other men arein for ten years and four for five years.      The fightingwas part of the revolutionary outbreak and a very bad part.Six men from among a rebel party who &quot;held up&quot; the townof Enniscorthy for some days are undergoing sentences offive years each; one constable was wounded here.Bryan Molloy, the leader of a party who held CarnmoreCrossroads against an armed force of the constabulary, ofwhom one was killed and one wounded,  is under a ten yearssentence.Eight men have three years sentences in respect of anorganised attack with arms upon the Oranmore Police Barracks
in County Galway and four men have like sentences for a likeattack at Clarinbridge Police Barracks in the same county,David Kent,  one of three brothers who were guilty,ofcausing the death of Head Constable Rowe, R.I.C., whileresisting the arrest of one of them,  is undergoing fiveyears&apos; penal servitude.     His elder brother who organisedthe resistance was sentenced to death and shot.John McEntee and three other men were convicted inconnection with an encounter on the way between Dundaik andDublin, when a body of armed rebels held up the traffic andkilled Constahle McGee o^ the R.I.C., who was on duty andwounded Lt. Dunville of the Grenadier Guards who was oneof the persons stopped.     McEntee was in command.      He did notfire the fatal shot,  but apart from rebellion would, havebeen held, guilty of McGee&apos;s death,  and of the wounding ofLt. Dunville.     He is under sentence of penal servitude forlife.Various men were arrested in remote places and sentencedto varying terms of penal servitude as participants in theRebellion and there is little to distinguish most of thecases.      Among them is Tomkins, who, when he was discovered bythe police on his way with other rebels to break up a lino ofrailway, fired point blank upon them.Speaking generally,  the prisoners are simply a body ofrebels who were under arms in the Rebellion and enga.ged in itwith varying degrees of activity.      None of them were amongthe prime movers in it so far as appears by the evidence.   Theonly cases in which I think any grave question arises a.s tothe propriety of inclusion in an amnesty are those,  like thecase of the Ashbourne fight,  in which murderous attacks weremade on the police.(Initialled)     H.E.D.
