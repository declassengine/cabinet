Department of Information.B. 3.Hot eg on a Conversation between Count Gleichen and Mr. SheldonCrosbie, Secretary to American Embassy in Vienna.&quot; Present: Mr. R.Y/. Seton-V/atson.Mr. Crosbie, who had left Vienna only three weelcs previously,v/as quite emphatic a3 to the hopelessness of any separate peacebetween Austria-Hungary and the Entente, and as to the desire anddetermination of the authorities to maintain their alliance withBerlin.He reports acute be.d feeling between Austrian and Germanofficers to be almost universal - the two groups avoiding each otherso far as possible.     Even the man in the street in Vienna showsmore and more resentment against the Germans.    But such feelingsof discontent and pique do not for a moment affect the poliiical orinternational situation, in respect of which Germany has completecontrol of her ally.Vienna, he held, was not in a position to conduct an offensiveagainst Russia or to resist a determined Russian offensive.     Anattack by Russia was all the more desirable, because Austria doesnot expect it (both Austrian and German reserves have been withdrawn).On the other hand, if Russia could be paralysed, Austria-Hungarycould launch a really formidable attach upon Italy, of whom she isnot in the least afraid.     (Mr. Crosbie found far more alarm ofAustria among the Italians v/hom he had met since entering neutraland lintente countries than alarm of Italy in Vienna.)Ee believed that very serious injuries could be inflicted uponthe Galician oil-fields by airmen coming from the Russian front, andbased this view upon conversations with an oil-expert in Viennawhose knowledge of the oil-fields dated back for years. ($Standard Oil)In February the Kaiser during hiB visit to Vienna, had urged AurfcrAngary to find another million men by increasing the age limit.   GenerHazai
)azai, Hungarian Minister of   National Defence, speaking for Hungary,   hade fused this proposal, hut said he could supply the necessary men byadit ional 1 comb ing* out&apos;.At &quot;that period political changes in Hungary had seemed certain, butifTce then Count Tisza had become stronger than ever.Mr. Crosbie confirmed the reports of the Emperor Charles&apos;s personalopularity, but did not credit him with any very clear or definite politicaldeas, though they Y/ere doubtless developing under stress of circumstances,he ijmptjeSB is very devout, and spends a good deal of time in jaar-privateapel, but is not regarded as very powerful politically or as exercisingdominating influence over her husband, as has sometimes been hinted ofte in iihtente countries.The only figure who has come to the front during the new reign isunt Czernin, who enjoys very wide confidence.     Count Clam-Martinic Mr.osbie regarded as not much more than a puppet-     He agreed that thelitical crisis which followed Dr. von Koerberfs resignation of the Austriaeiniership last December were almost certainly prearranged between him, Dron Spitzmflller and Count Tisza.Mr. Crosbi&apos; did not anticipate serious developments from the Social-fet movement.     The spirits of the general public are kept up by lyingsmmuniques and a careful presentation of news: and only a really bigrman defeat on the western front is likely to produce an awakening,ortage of food has produced very great misery among the poorer classes,t there is no prospect of its stopping thewwar.&amp;r. Crosbie stated that after the rupture between Germany and theited States the Emperor Charles sent three messages through separateannels to the American ambassador assuring him that whatever happenedstria-Hungary would not break with America.     But shortly after thiscunt Czernin visited the German Chancellor in Berlin with the result thatpthing more was heard of preventing a breach.     The ambassador lookedthis volte face as unquestionably due to pressure from Berlin.
.176Conversation with Mr. V/. Coffin, American Consul-Generalin Budapest.---o0o---o0o---0O0---Like his colleague in Vienna, Mr. Coffin regarded the idea of aseparate peace as quite impracticable.     The Magyars, whose share in theresponsibility in the war he was not inclined to admit, had identifiedthemselves politically with Berlin, anJ however much they might dislikethe Germans individually, realised that Hungary&apos;s future in its present-orm depends upon maintaining the alliance.All such hopes as arc entertained in Hungary of a successful issueio the i.?ar rest on two things only - the success of the submarine campaignImd the Russian revolution.     Mr. Coffin holds that if the illusory naturepf those hopes could once be brought homo, there would be a very rapidtall in morale in Hungary.     He considers the attitude of the British(press in emphasising the submarine danger a grave tactical error, whichay greatly encouraged Berlin as well as Budapest.fie regards both Charles and Czernin as men of very strong will, whover-ride all opposition.     His conversation reflected the Magyar outlook:zernin he regarded as quite unscrupulous an3 personally unsympathetic,nd he said that the Magyars regarded Charles as too much in the hands ofne high Bohemian nobility.     Tisza and Czernin &amp;l&amp;like each other in-enscly, the reconciliation sometimes hinted in the press being merelyPParent.     Any idea of a real rapprochement between them is a delusion,erlin is strong enough to prevent Charles from dismissing Tisza butzernin is easily strong enough to prevent any attempts of Tisza to drivefrom power.     The manner of Baron Burian&apos;3 dismissal was particularlyrutal: he was given a few hours to go, and this was notoriously meant asa affront at his friend and patron, Tisza.     Charles^ clerical   leaningsayc-d their part in the coolness between him and Ti3za who, in hisgacity as Prime Minister, insisted in filling the office of Palatine atthe
ho Coronation.     The fact that Tisza is one of the leaders of the Magyaralvinists made his prominence in a great Catholic reli&amp;ious ceremonyarticularly objectionable to Charles.     The fact that Tisza does notelong to one of the great magnate families but to the lesser gentrythe title was given to his uncle 20 years ago - R.S.V.) appears also toeigh with Charles.     Mr. Coffin regarded this question as a very importantlet or in the relations of the two men.     He v/as entirely disinclined toelieve the stories spread since the beginning of the v/ar about theIssolute and drunken character of Charles.     He confirmed Mr. Crosbie&apos;sBiew that the jimpress did not play so great a part in politics as issometimes suggested abroad.     He looked upon her as not more clerical thanBbr husband.     She is sometimes regarded as having leanings towards theELlies (probably owing to her education and the present position of herBrothers in the Belgian army).       The little heir to the throne is verypopular in Budapest and mcuh sentiment is expended on him.Mr. Coffin&apos;s Views on Hungarian Politicians.--se0o---o0o oOo--*-(l)   Count Andrassy*s relations with Tisza had been patched up in theirst months of the v/ar and became quite tolerable.     Then a proposal v/asde that Andrassy should go to Rome as ambassador: but this v/as sat upony Tisza without Andrassy being allowed to have any inkling.     V/hen theact eventually leaked out, their relations of course became as bad asver.    Andrassy is regarded in Budapest as on the shelf for the present,spite of his close relations with Berlin and his active interest in theolish Question.(2)     Count Apponyi was very useful to Tisza as his chief link with thepposition leaders and held Uihem back till the secession of Karolyi lastummer.    Tisza found him so useful as to prevent his appointment (whenoted.) as ambassador to \7ashington.     neither of these leaders differsrom Tisza in matters of policy.(3)     Count Karolyi is honest and attractive but does not occupy a verys^.ous place in politics.     He cuts a very poor figure in the House owingoo an impediment in his suecch.     Whoever tlic House is not sitting he hasto
rejoin his regiment (in which he is only a corporal or a sergeant),is more or less pro-Ally in sentiment, &quot;but does not weigh mcuhainst the other party leaders.     He told Mr. Coffin that he had spokenry frankly to Charles, warning him that unless his policy changed the,bsburgs would he the mere vassals of the Hohenzollerns.     Karolyiearns of a Balkan Federation under Hungaryfs leadership, but his ideasAiot very clear and are not unnaturally regarded as fantastic by mostIliticians.     His second, Count Batthyany, is not a very marked person-ity.    Mr. Justh is the ablest and straightest of the Independencerty but in poor health and finished politically.     Mr. Hollo&apos;&apos;, theit or of the party organ Magyarorsz^g, is the brains of his group, butss scrupulous.(4)    Mr. Rakovsky, the clercdal leader (People&apos;s party) is regardedI a much more troublesome and dangerous critic to the government thanIrolyi or his party.     His Chauvinism is extreme and his whole mannerby brutal.It was rumoured that 400,000 German troops were quartered inAngary - partly for political purposes: but Mr. Coffin had no means(latever of verifying thiB.     There has neuer been during the war[limosity towardsj^/the Russians or&quot;even&quot;&quot;the Serbs.     Magyar hatred hasttcrly concentrated on the Rumanians and Italians.     The feelingptv/een the Magyars and Croats is also very acute and Agram is almost toopt for Magyar visitors.     The Russian prisoners are very popular through-It all classes, being scattered everywhere for farm work: and theyjpear to be well treated and sometimes even petted.Mr. Coffin estimates the Hungarian harvest of 1915 as only 50 pere*it Of the normal, and considers that this year it v/ill probably onlyp 40 per cent of the normal.     The food situation is serious but not im-fossible, at any rate for the country people and those who can pay in theov/ns.     There is little fat or red meat, but chickens and game of allmds are fairly plentiful on the market.     Sugar is also obtainable.     Onepeat difficulty is transport.     The Germans took a large amount offt Hungarian
garian rolling stock with them for their Rumanian campaign (three orr thousand trucks) and have since refused to return it.     What is left(deteriorating and the lack of grease is extremely   serious.     The coalbad (practically only brown coal).     During the extreme cold sometories had to close down altogether, and there was no fuel intapest for seven days.     Mr. Coffin had a flat at the Gresham BuildingsJich might be compared to V/hitehall Court - R.E.W.): but even therewithout heating, took his meals in his bathroom, where he had a11 heating apparatus, and went to bed in order to be warm.     The Con-late had to close at lunch-time as his staff could not stand the cold.
