Department of Information.SECTION Pi DRW/006.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. VI.May &quot;30, 1917.parliament and the Proposed Reforms.After some days of discussion both the Senate and Chamberof Deputies suspended their sittings on May 22 In order toallow two Commissions, composed of members of the two Houses,to draw up the text of the proposed revision of the Constitution.Mr Brsftianu- gave a good send-off to the labours of theCommissions in a speech in which) while he spoke of theproposed reforms * universal suffrage and land expropriation -as &quot;sacrlfices&quot; (as they are from the point of view of thegoverning classes), he none the less declared them a^fittingreturn for &quot;the heroism and self-sacrifice shown by the peasantpopulation&quot;.   It is satisfactory that Mr Bratianu has seen theurgent need of pushing forward with these reforms and doesnot propose to &quot;wait until a complete and detailed elaborationof the principles laid down is possible&quot;.The election of the future Constituent Chambers on a basisof universal and equal suffrage is to take place &quot;as the resultof the realisation of national unity&quot; - that is to say, afternot only Wallachia has been freed, but Transilvania and theother unredeemed lands in Austria-Hungary have been unitedwith Rumania.   To these Chambers will be left not only theworking out of the franchise and land reforms (to be votedin principle by the present Parliament), but also the givingof a permanent character to the civil service (thus removing it
from party control and &quot;ensuring&quot;, as Mr Bratianu put it, &quot;the freeexpression of universal suffrage.&quot;)Only when this is done is the difficult Jewish question to beentered on.   Mr Bratianu has now publicly acknowledged that thequestion &quot;changed its aspect the moment we decided to take partin the war in order to free the territory of the neighbouringRumanian regions inhabited by Jewish subjects&quot;.   There are fewjews in Transilvania proper but a considerable number in theMaramures and Oradea Mare (Groeswardein) districts claimed byRumania.   The prospect o^their future incorporation in Rumania,does of course, as Mr Bratianu says   and Mr Take Ionescu haslong foreseen, make the settlement of Jewish grievances in Rumaniaa most urgent question.   But still more important is the necessityof satisfying International, Jewish and Socialist opinion as to thefuture progressive and tolerant character of the Rumanian Administrationespecially it is necessary to conciliate Jewish opinion in Americaand Socialist opinion in Russia.     The latter is decidedlyhostile to Rumania.   For instance, in the Rabochaya Gazeta(April 23/May 6) appears a paragraph of eulogy of the SocialistRakovski who was arrested by the Rumanian Government in the firstdtys .of the war, as the paper puts it &quot;only for agitation againstImperialism&quot;, and was freed by the Russian troops in Iasi onKay 1.   The article contains much abuse of^Rumania1^ authority.uoand is symptomatic of the state of feeling in Russia on the subject.This being so it was imperative, quite apart from the question ofTransilvania, that the Rumanian Government should enter on thequestion of Jewish reform.    The decision they have arrived atlooks like a compromise between two views: that of those who wouldH once (a very small number) sweep away all Jewish disabilities andinequalities, and that of mere reactionary politicians who wouldiike to confine themselves to promises and postpone indefinitelyVneir execution.
ir Br^tienu probably belongs to the latter school, but he isIfise enough to see that Europe will not be content any longerwith the shelving of the Jewish question.   The solution heproposes, viz. that the position of the Jews should be consideredby the constituent Chambers elected on a basis of equaluniversal suffrage after the realisation of national unity,is calculated to please both parties - the reactionaries andanti-Semites because it postpones the question of the admissionof the Jews to citizenship, the reformers because it proposesto hand over to the newly enfranchised democracy as a wholethe decision of the position of the Jews.     The only thing thatis not certain is how far this future treatment of the questionfill satisfy Jewish and pro-Jewish opinion abroad.    It isegrettable that there seems no sign of the granting of certaintangible reforms, such as the removal of disabilities on Jewserying in the Army, e.g. the denial of commissioned rank toIthem.   if some definite reform of this character were made,ev/ish feeling would be more prepared to wait for the considerationf their admission to the rights of full citizenship later.A rare and valuable recognition from the Socialist point ofview of Rumania&apos;s well-justified rights to union with theumans of Hungary appeared in an interview in the Daily TelegraphMay 29) with the Belgian Socialist leader Mr Vandervelde.e expressed the view that there was no difference between theffort of his own country to prevent the annexation of Belgium\hd the Rumanian effort to realise the transfer of Transilvania.went on: &quot;To liberate Rwmuiito, for example, from the dominion&apos;f the Turk, to give back the Trentino to Italy, restore Alsace-jorraine to France, and to free the Rumans of Transilvania,
4.369would not &quot;be to annex--territories against the wishes of theinhabitants, but, on the contrary, to liberate thoseterritories in accordance with such wishesr&quot;.If Mr Vandervelde can persuade Socialist opln 1 on^ln.,Kuaslaito see the (justice and logic of his views on the Transilvanianquestion, he will have accomplished a great thing for thecause of small nations and the permanent peace of Europe.A.W.A.L.May 30, 1917.
