ftput In touch with Sir Eric Geddes, and are giving him wholeheartedco-operation.DEVELOPMENT OP PORT FACILITIES.   The organization of aport Branch, to which reference was made in last week&apos;a report,Ihas advanced a step further.     The Ministry have &quot;been fortunatein securing the services of Mr. L. A.P. Warner, Deputy GeneralManager under the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, as Director ofthe new Branch.    Mr. Warner was on the staff of the London andNorth Western Railway before joining the Mersey Board, and thuscombines Railway and Dock experience, a point of great importancein view of the close Interdependence of Railway and Dock problems.The development of facilities at the Western Ports is receivingspecial attention, and conferences have already been held withthe Wheat Commission and the Railway Executive.    The Port questionhas hitherto been largely in the hands of the Port and TransitExecutive Committee, but that Committee has for a long time pastbeen carrying on its work in close association with the Ministry.It now has its headquarters in the same building, and theorganization of the new Branch of the Ministry will affordopportunities for still closer co-ordination.   It has becomeabundantly clear that if any substantial results are to be achieved,the Port problem and the Railway problem must be treated as one,the multiplication of separate Committees avoided, and authorityconcentrated as far as possible in one Department.The attention of the Ministry has been called to certainvery misleading statements reported in the Press as having beenmade by Mr. Ben Tillett at a Trade Union meeting with regard todelays and inefficient handling of ships in port.     Steps arebeing taken to have the true state of the case made known.REQUISITIONING OF DUTCH SHIPS.     Steps have been   taken,W wUh the concurrence of the Foreign Office, to requisition certainships sailing under the Dutch flag, which are really owned bytwo British firms.    Up to the present, six ships have actuallybeen/
been acquired, and it is hoped that a few more will comewithin British jurisdiction at an early date when they willbe similarly dealt with.     Arrangements are being made to sendon to Holland the cargo of the two ships which were destinedfor that country.OIL CARRIERS. A serious position has arisen owingto the shortage of oil carriers for the Navy and for commercialpurposes, and the matter is receiving close attention.     Thisshortage is due to submarine losses.     In order to meet theshortage in oil carrying tonnage, it has been suggested thatsome of the standard ships now being built might be adapted forcarrying oii.     It appears that by the introduction ofstructural modifications Into the framework of the standard shipsat an early stage, any ship can be converted into an oil carrierIn a very short space of time after the vessel ie complete.Proposals on the subject of tonnage for the carriage of oil arebeing submitted to the Yfar Cabinet.VESSELS HELD UP IN BALTIC PORTS.   Messages have beenreceived within the last twentyf our hours which indicate thatas the result of measures taken In concert with the ForeignOffice a considerable number of British ships held up sincethe outbreak of war may succeed in making good their escape.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) John Anderson.
