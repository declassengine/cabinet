Operations, SECRET.Prom Col. Thomson to C.I.G.S.18/5/17.C.3,595. May 18th 9 a.m. ^A pessimistic view with regard to an offensive In this theatre istaken by Gen. Ragosa, who is acting for Gen.Scherbatchoff during thelatter&apos;s absence in Petrograd.   He says that he has not sufficient3onp- ranc-e artillery and aeroplanes while ammunition is lacking forartillery already on the front. Previously Russian offensives havebeen conducted regardless of losses but the men have now had enoughof such tactics and would be unwilling to attack under presentconditions. The revolution in Russia has had an unsettling effect onthe minds of the men at the front who say they are peasants first &amp;soldiers afterwards. The large powers which the soldiers committeesexercise naturally affect discipline,Any isolated offensive on the part of the (?2nd) Roumanian Armyseems premature under the circumstances, Gen.Averesco is planningwhat he describes as a local offensive to take place during thenext three weeks.As this offensive will involve the employment of3 Divisions(half the total Roumanian Army now 6n the front) andeven if it succeeds will result in the capture of a few mountainvillages without any particular value,it seems a useless expend-iture of ammunition and future operations may be seriously prej-udiced by the losses in men. It is doubtful whether the RoumanianGovernment will allow Gen.Averesco to carry out his plan unlesstheir hand is forced by the zest of those political elements whourge an offensive because it is theoretically desirable withoutreflecting on ways and means and the final result to be obtained.Gen.Presan,C in C, has discussed at Russian H.Q. a plan for acombined Russo-Roumanian offensive on the front of the 6th Russian ArmyThis   -
This operation will involve employing some of the divisions.now undergoing reorganisation in the interior and the date ofits execution depends on the arrival of horses and equipmentfrom Russia.     As usual Gen, Presan is most optimistic andseems to think only of our numerical superiority on this front.This is considerable but is discounted by ?want of organisation,lack of communications and the disparity between strength ofallied units on paper and the number of fit men who can becounted upon for offensive action.     Taking into account allthe factors which affect the general situation here it seemsto me that for the present any lar^e scale offensive is quiteimpossible in this theatre.   Local operations against Pocsaniand Braila are or should be possible in a short time, and thecapture of these places would facilitate future operations onthe line of the Sereth.Except at Galatz where railway station and parts of (?line)have recently been bombarded, the enemy is inactive along thewhole front,(Repeated to Gen. Hanbury Williams.)
