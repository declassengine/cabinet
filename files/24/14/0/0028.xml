COPY.. // &apos;        v t-lSECBIT, WAR CABINET, flC-.T.828. Intelligence BureauDepartment of InformationSECTION C. CRW/005WTOCLY REPORT PIT RUSSIA. V.    -(May 21, 1917)1,Thg &quot;flew Government.The new Coalition Government contains six Socialist members,some being Social Revolutionaries and some Social Democrats of theModerate wing.   The former belong to the same party as Mr.Kerenskiand should more properly be termed Agrarian Socialists, as it ischiefly on the land question that they differ from the Social Demo-crats.     On the question of war aims their views may be regardedas identical with those of the Social Democrats.   With Mr.Kerenskias Minister of War and Mr.Chernov Minister of Agriculture, the parlyof the Social Revolutionaries is very strongly represented in theCabinet.   The other member, Mr.Pyeshekhonov, the new Minister ofFood Supplies, is an intellectual, belonging to a small group closerconnected with the same party.     He is chiefly known as a publicistTwo of the leaders of the Mensheviki (the Moderate wing of theSocial Democrats) have joined the Cabinet, viz: Messrs. Tseretelliand Skobelev.   Of these the former is the more important owing tohis striking personality.     Like Mr.Kerenski he is a young man (stillin the 30&apos;s) with great gifts of oratory.   He is a Georgian by birthand was a member of the second Duma, but has spent the last few yearsin exile in Siberia.     He shares Mr.Kerenski&apos;s views both as regardsthe vigorous prosecution of the war and the enunciation of war aimswithout annexations or indemnities.   Mr.Skobelev is a man of lessaccount than either Mr.Tseretelli or Mr.Chkheidze. The latter hasnot entered the Cabinet, evidently wishing to retain his post asPresident of the Council of Workmen.&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates..The resignation of Messrs. Guchkov and Milyukov will put theCoalition Cabinet in a much stronger position in dealing with theCouncil of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates.    It will be muchmore difficult for the Extremists to rouse strong feeling against
the new Government now that they are no longer able to use thenames of Guchkov and Milyukov for the purposes of agitation.The statement made by the New foreign Minister on May 20 is mostconciliatory towards the Socialists without giving way to theirextravagant demands about the publication of secret treaties.&apos; Mr. Tereshchenko is most friendly towards England and has nopolitical past to make him unpopular in Russia.War Aims and Peace Tendencies.The immediate problem that the new Government will have todeal with is that of war aims.     The Government has pledged itselfto &quot;a peace without annexations or indemnities and based on theright of nations to decide their own affairs&quot;, and has promisedto &quot;take steps towards bringing about an agreement with the allieson the basis of its declaration of April 10&quot;.There is little doubt that Russia1s war aims will now bestated much more definitely than while Mr.Milyukov was ForeignMinister.     The fact that Mr.Avksentyev, A Social revolutionary,hoia.s the next position to Mr.Tereshchenko in the Ministry ofForeign Affairs means that the cry &quot;peace without annexations orindemnities&quot; will be given more definite shape.     So far this cryhas been left vague;   it may now be applied to particular questions.In general terms the Moderate Socialists-agree that the only bas.isfor a rearrangement of the map of Europe is the self-determinationof Nationalities, i.e. the right of nations to decide under whatgovernment they shall live.     They refuse to accept the right ofpossession as the result of military conquest.     As applied to theGerman Colonies they will not listen to any justification of ourright to keep our conquests until we accept the principle that allthese matters shall be made the subject of negotiation at the peaceconference.     They do not demand the return of the Colonies toGermany, but that the subject should remain open to discussion,in other words they will not- admit that the ill-treatment of peoplesby the Germans and Turks gives us the right to annex the territories
concerned now, though they are willing to acknowledge our motivesand perhaps accept our conclusions provided we agree to theprinciple of free discussion at the peace conference.   Otherwisethey regard our explanations as excuses or cloaks for Imperialism.It would appear that we can only meet them on the principle theyhave themselves enunciated, viz. &quot;the self-determination ofnationalities&quot;;   until or unless that principle can be accepted&quot;by England, France and Italy, they will probably continue todenounce the Allied Governments as ImperialistsShe formula &quot;no annexations, no indemnities and the self-determination of nationalities&quot; is roughly outlined in the follow-ing peace programme published by the organ of the Moderate SocialDemocrats: -*(1) The old map of Europe will serve as the basis for definingthe boundaries of States *(2) Each of the belligerent States is given the right to layclaim to any province on its frontiers which before the war wasin foreign hands *(g) The population of the frontier-provinces are given theright of declaring their wish to form an independent State and tolay claim to any provinces in one or several belligerentcountries.   This declaration will be considered if not less thanjfor example, ten per cent, of the adult population declaresin favour of it.(4) In the event of such a wish being expressed, the PeacebyConference undertakes to arrange/a definite date a plebiscite.The voting must be universal, equal -and secret and must takeplace under the supervision of representatives of both sidesand of the local population.    The result of the voting is to bethe final decision of the question.(5) A fund of, for example, 25 milliard francs is to be formedfor the restoration of provinces that have been overrun.   Thebelligerent States are to take part in the formation of the fundin proportion to their military expenses.   The fund is to   e
117   Idistributed between the provinces that have suffered according tothe damage that has been done.     This fund is the democraticalternative to indemnities^The Land Question.The Land Question is the one that chiefly interests the vastmajority of the population.   A proper solution of this question inthe immediate future is of the utmost importance for (l) political(2) economic reasons,(l)   The most reliable and moderating force in Russia is to befound in the peasantry.   The All-Russia Peasant Congress now sittingin Petrograd desires that the land shall be shared among thosethat work it and that no man shall have more land than he can workhimself.   If the members of the Congress get definite assurancesfrom the Government (as they undoubtedly will from the newGovernment) that their requests will be granted,they will exercisea very steadying influence in the country districts when theyreturn home.   This will have an equally steadying effect on thetroops at the front, the bulk of whom are peasants.(2)   The land question must be dealt with vigorously foreconomic reasons.   Agrarian disorders are being reported almostdaily from many districts.   This is largely due to the conduct ofthe landowners, who, knowing that their lands will be taken fromthem by the Constituent Assembly, are trying to realise as muchmoney as they can by cutting down their forests.   Such conductinfuriates the  peasants, who demand that aid. land transactionsmust be prohibited such as the sale or mortage of land,and thatdistrict Committees must be formed for the sowing and tillingof waste land, etc   The landowners, feeling that they may soonbe dispossessed of their estates, have neglected the sowing oftheir lands and unless measures are takeh immediately the countrymay be threatened with famine in the near future.
