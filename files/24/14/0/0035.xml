Any further communication should beaddressed not to any individual by name,but to  -The Director,Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,Food Production Department,Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,Food Production Department,;:^N 72, Victoria Street,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1.and should quote the Reference Number andDate of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address:-&quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot;Telephone:-Victoria 8240.London, S.W. 1.23rd May, 1917.&apos; Sir,I beg to submit the following Report of the   Food Produc-tion Department for the week ending 22nd May:-The 1918 Programme.The position of the 1918 Programme is becoming increasing-ly serious in the continued absence of a Cabinet decision withregard to labour and horses.     It will be remembered that the fullProgramme was submitted to the Cabinet on April 20th and itsadoption by the Government was announced by the Prime Minister inhis speech at the Guildhall on April 28th,were taken by this Department to organise the breaking up andcultivation of the additional 3,000,000 acres in England and Wales,and great  2nd continuous pressure has been brought to bear uponthe County Committees to commence their share of the task.     Atfirst, and mainly owing to the effect of the Prime Minister1sannouncement, the Programme was received, if not with enthusiasmat any rate with a spirit of determination to respond to the callof duty in the hour of the nation&apos;s need.     Speaking generally,County Committees have shown remarkable energy in preparing theirplans of action and estimates of their essential requirements.There Is, however, a universal and natural unwillingness, expressedwith much frankness and vigour, to proceed&apos; any further until anOn the strength of that announcement immediate steps
official guarantee is forthcoming that the irreducible minima inthe way of additional labour, horses, snd other requisiteswill be supplied in due course.     Otherwise the breaking upof pastures would be a futile operation, productive not offood but of financial and agricultural disaster.No one knows this better than the farmers and theCounty Committees, who having done their utmost to respond tothe call for increased production are now confronted with theparalysing fact that, since the Prime Minister made his speech,so far from any extra labour or horses being provided by theGovernment the number of men on the land has been actuallyreduced, by nearly 20,000, and the War Office is engaged inrequisitioning farmers1 horses.     This action will have a mostinjurious effect upon the harvest of 1917 - let alone theProgramme for 1918.    The position, In short, Is developing inthe direction of substraction instead of addition and theDepartment is being overwhelmed with remonstrances, appeals,and Parliamentary questions, to which no satisfactory responsecan be given and which ad $enormously to its difficulties.This is having a disastrous effect upon the prestige andauthority of the Department and! its agents and unless somethingis done quickly their position will become untenable.I. LOCAL ORGANISATION.Work of the Agricultural Executive Committees.The following instances of specific action areselected for illustration:-In Monmouthshire the Committee have appointed 40visitors (of whom twenty are farmers and the rest surveyors andland-agents) to report on every holding of more than five acresjin Cheshire a survey of every farm Is being arranged and othercounties are making similar arrangements;   the East SuffolkCommittee are making a tour of the county as a body and holdingjoint meetings with the District Sub-Committees at the headquartersof the latter.
Bedfordshire - The Committee have been authorised to takepossession of 20 acres of glebe land at Wilstead and 23 atLangford for cultivation for 1918.Cheshire - The Cheshire Committee are dealing, under the Drainageof Lands Orders, with the cleansing of the drains emptying intothe  iver Birkett in the Wirral Peninsula.   It is said thatwhen this work is completed 1,500 acres of marsh land will bebrought into cultivation.Kent - The Committee have taken possession of 49 acres of landat Darehth for summer fallowing and of a 100 acre farm atSwingfield for the same purpose.Suffolk, East - The Committee have given authority to enteron land at Scole for the purpose of reducing the number ofrabbits which were over-running the Warren Hills farm.   Thisis the first instance reported of action taken under the RabbitsOrder recently made.Suffolk, West - The Committee are taking possession of 134acres of land at Walsham-le-Willows and of 80 acres at Elmswell.Sussex, East - The Committee are taking possession of 30 acresof land which had been laid out as building land at TelscombeCliffs; this estate adjoins that of Anzac-on-Sea (now calledPeace Haven), of part of which the Committee have alreadytaken possession.Yorkshire, East Riding - The Committee are taking action underthe Drainage of Lands Orders with regard to various parts ofthe County, and are giving notices to the occupiers as a
preliminary to carrying out the necessary works.Determination of Tenancies,Since the amendment of Regulation 2M which was incorpor-ated in the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917, dated 15th March,1917, the landlords have been authorised to determine the tenanciesin 44 cases, provision being made for adequate compensation to bepaid to the tenants and for the landlords to be able to make such acounter-claim as Would arise under the Agricultural Holdings Act,1908,   In all but two of the cases the landlord has been authorisedto determine the tenancy forthwith, subject to the tenant beingallowed to reside in the dwelling house for four weeks longer.In two cases, however, the determination has been authorised asfrom next Michaelmas,     The landlords are informed, when the Orderis handed to them, that it does net compel them to determine thetenancy unless they desire to do so, but in almost all the casesit is believed that the landlord has availed himself of theauthority, and has either put in a new and more efficient tenantor has taken the farm in hand.     It is hoped that the change ofoccupation thus effected will obviate the necessity of possession&quot;being taken by the Executive Committee and will bring about anincrease in the food supply.Up to the present the power for the Board itself todetermine a tenancy has not been exercised.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2)Reports from 924 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that167,731 applications for plots have been made, and that 148,807plots, containing a total area of 11,093 acres, have beenprovided.   In addition, since December last, many plots havebeen provided by private enterprise, and the area of permanentallotments provided independently of the Cultivation of LandsOrders has been largely increased.
HORTICULTURAL SECTION.As a result of the circular letter sent out to ParishCouncils urging the formation of Pood Production Societies,information has been received that twenty such societies havealready been formed and that others are in course of formation.During the week 3,000 pamphlets on vegetable growing havebeen distributed among 1,062 elementary schools as a result of a   &apos;circular letter sent out by the Board of Education at the instanceof this Department,     In all 7,400 pamphlets have been distributedduring the week.Potato Spraying,    During the week orders have been received for1,835 Knapsack Spraying Machines and for 6,570 cases of sprayingmaterial,      A cinematograph film illustrating potato growingand spraying is no7f being exhibited throughout the country.     TheLocal Government Board has given Its approval to a suggestionthat Parish Councils and small Local Authorities should beempowered to provide spraying machines for the use of allotmentsand to make a charge on the rates for&apos; this purpose.Public meetings are being addressed by members of thestaff of the Department on the advantages of potato spraying,and it is obvious that interest in the spraying scheme isbecoming widespread^Preserving Fruit and Vegetables. Six staff instructors havebeen trained in London in the methods of preserving fruit andvegetables. They will act as teachers to classes of personsselected to serve as travelling instructors.An order for 2,000,000, 2 lb. glass jars of the typesuitable for bottling fruit and vegetables has been placed withthe manufacturers through the Ministry of Munitions, and arrange-ments are being made for the supply of a further 2,000,000 bottles,A comprehensive scheme for the preservation of surplusfruit and vegetables, on a large scale throughout the country, isnow under consideration, but it is not sufficiently advanced tobe explained in this week&apos;s Report,
II. TECHNICAL DIVISION,There are no special developments in the v/ork of thisDivision to report this week.III, LABOUR.A Circular Letter has been issued during the weekinstructing Agricultural Executive Committees at once to set upLabour Sub-Committees, consisting of not more than two membersof the Executive together with other persons co-opted from out-side.    The functions of this Sub-Committee will he to deal withmatters relating to the supply, distribution, housing and wagesof all   forms of labour, including women, as well as questionsaffecting the retention of existing labour on the land, thework of Tribunals, substitution, etc.Soldier Labour.     In response to the representations of thisDepartment, the War Office has cancelled its announcement thatmen of the Agricultural Companies were to be used to meet thedemands of the Director of Timber Supplies.      These Companiesare to be raised to their full establishment of 11,500 men,of whom nearly 6,500 are already at work on the land.   Enquiriesare being made with a view to getting the remaining physicaily-fit men taken up by farmers as soon as possible.   It isdesirable that the War Office should gradually substituteskilled agriculturists from other units, such as the RoyalDefence Corps, and Labour Battalions, or skilled men workingunder the Forage Committee, for any unsuitable men now in theAgricultural Companies.Prisoners of War.     Schemes are being prepared by AgriculturalExecutive Committees for the employment of further batches ofprisoners of war.   Worcestershire is preparing to employ 4 or5 additional gangs, and Herefordshire a batch at Ross-on-Wye,while Chester has a scheme in contemplation in connection withdrainage work.   In addition, 75,prisoners will bo required forwork in Cambridge on land to be taken over by the Agricultural
Executive Committee,     150 prisoners have been secured forreclamation work which is being carried out by H.M. Office ofWoods &amp;c. at Wingland, at the mouth of the Wash, by which some500 acres will be brought into cultivation for the harvest of1918.WOMEN1S BRANCH.Although the number of recruits coming forward forwork on the land is satisfactory the difficulty of securingemployment for women has not been appreciably reduced during theweek.     In the majority of counties there seem to be no furtheropenings for women at present.   On the other hand In a few thereis undoubtedly an Increasing demand for women milkers.   There isa very large increase in the number of individual farmers offeringtraining facilities for women6   The Department are glad to availthemselves of such offers, not only because it is necessary toprovide training for unskilled women before they are placed Inemployment for wages, but also because these practice farms areproving most helpful in showing neighbouring farmers what workcan be undertaken by women.   Counties are realising theadvantages of employing Group-Leaders for part-time workers, andat the present time the damand for Leaders is in excess of thesupply.The general county organisation for employment andtraining of.inomen for work on the land is working smoothly, andit is hoped that the Labour Sub-committees to which reference ismade under the previous heading; will, by co-operation with thewomen&apos;s organisation, overcome the present difficulty of securingincreased employment for women0MACHINERY.A further 34 Tractors have arrived during the weekfrom America, bringing the total number of Government ownedTractors up to 625*   37 Tractors which had been placed- 7 k   8 -
! li     I157temporarily at the disposal of the Department have been returnedto their owners during the week.   The new scheme for working theTractors in units cannot come into operation generally for another--week or so, hut in the meantime the Tractors are being fullyemployed and the work they are doing is meeting with general  -approval.IV. SUPPLIES.Perti11sers and Feeding Stuffs Section.Sulphate of Avjnonia.   The completed returns of the sales ofSulphate of Ammonia in March and April show a great development inthe use of this fertiliser in Agriculture.   Whereas before the warabout 60,000 tons per annum were sold for agricultural purposes,the sales in the last two months amounted to 62,050 tons, (thefigures for March and April 1916 being 25,790 tons).    In these twomonths in 1916 32$ of the total sales and 42$ of the totalmanufacture was sold for agriculture; in 1917 the correspondingfigures were 89$ of the total sales and 118$ of the totalmanufacture (stocks being heavily reduced).Of the total sales for agricultural purposes in March andApril 1917, 11,990 tons or 29$ was distributed through the Sulphateof Ammonia Advisory Committee. In this controlled distributionEngland received 19$, Scotland 4$ and Ireland 6$.    In view of thecomplaints which have been made that Ireland did not get a propersupply, it may be pointed out that, apart from permanent andtemporary grass, the area of cultivated land in England and Wales isabout three times that of Ireland.Superphosphate - The Fertilisers Committee has decided to ask theShipping Controller to fix a freight for phosphate rock which wouldallow of superphosphate of standard quality (30$) being sold nextseason at a price not exceeding  5 per ton f.o,r. at makers&apos; works.This price would compare favourably with the prices which have ruledduring the current season, and it is certain that if arrangements
can be made for the sale of Superphosphate at this price the demandwill be very large.Basic Slag- - The Fertilisers Committee has also decided to recommendthe grinding of low-grade basic slag which is being produced in largequantities, but for which there is at present no commercial outlet.The Ministry of Munitions are preparing an estimate of the cost oferecting suitable mills and producing the ground slag. The threeAgricultural Departments will be asked to guarantee part of the cost.Potash. - The Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Munitions haveframed a scheme which has been submitted for Dr.Addison&apos;s approval.This scheme includes the provision that the Board of Agricultureshall until 1920 purchase the whole make of muriate of potash of anew company being set up to work the British Cyanides patents forextracting potash from flue dust.   The maximum quantities of muriateof potash to be taken in each year are:- 1918, 2,000 - 4,000 tons at 17.10.0; 1919, 15,000 tons at  14; 1920, 15,000 tons at  14.Lime.- Enquiries have been addressed to some 350 firms producing ordealing in agricultural lime.   No information has been given by thelargest producing firm.   The replies of the others show theirpresent output to be 90,000 tons of agricultural lime as againstover 200,000 tons before the war.   The reduction is almost entirelydue to labour difficulties. Lime production has not hitherto been acertified occupation, but arrangements have now been made for addingit to the list. Firms are no?; being asked what additional labour theyare prepared to employ forthwith,and efforts will be made to findsuitable labour.Seeds Section.Seed Potatoes-  - The recent order on grubbing hops has produced afurther demand for seed potatoes in Kent.   Quotations have beenobtained from Ireland, and if the hop-growers agree to the priceasked, a consignment will be shipped immediately.
Seed Corn.The Ministry of Pood have been asked to authorisethe purchase of seed corn by the Department at prices in advanceof those ruling for ordinary grain.    It is understood that theMinistry&apos;s Legal Adviser is considering the form of licence whichcould be given for this purpose.   Arrangements are in progressfor the purchase and storage of 3eed corn on behalf of theDepartment by tradersj under the general supervision of ProvincialCommittees of the National British and Irish Corn TradeAssociation.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
