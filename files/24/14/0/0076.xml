/Gen.Ho./28.WAR CABINET.,REPRISALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,The War Cabinet decided that the desirability oftaking reprisals for German acts of brutality towards prisonersof war should be considered in each case on its merits.    Thereare many instances of what I will call &quot;minor&quot; acts of brutalityto which our men are now subjected and, while I am reluctant totrouble the War Cabinet with every individual case,. I do notfeel that I am authorised to deal with them all on my ownresponsibility.The following may be taken as typical examples of the&apos;callousness and lack of all proper feeling displayed by the.Germans towards prisoners of war(l)   Absolutely unjustifiable delays in the notificationof the priacners of war. in their custody, which causesneedless distress to the relatives.(2)   Great, and apparently calculated, delay in the despatchof letters written by prisoners of war.(3)   Brutal treatment of ou.r men in close proximity tothe German trenches^ both in the East and the West.(4)   Counter-rreprisals taken by Germany in imprisoning twoof our  ield Officers,I do not feel tb,at such oases as these should be allowedto p^ss unregarded, and I would suggest to the War Cabinetthat a small Committee be formed, to consist of a representativefrom theuJoreign Office, the Admiralty, and the War Office, witha member of the War Cabinet as Chairman, to consider these, andany further acts of brutality that may arise, and to give adecision, with the authority of the War Cabinet, as to whataction/ if any, should be taken by us by way of reprisal,   I donot think it would involve much.labour on the part of the memberof the War Cabinet who is appointed to preside.DERBY.30,5,17,
