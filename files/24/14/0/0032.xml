i t+t&quot;       -       133WAR GABINEffi ^LABOUR SITUATION.I. Copy of letter from Ministry of Labour to Secretary,.War Cabinet,.II. Report on the Labour Situation for week ending May 23rd,1917MINiaW OF LABOUR,   ,Montagu House,Whitehall,S.W.Hay 24th, 1917Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Labour to forward theenclosed copy of the Weekly Report prepared in this Department,dealing with the Labour situation.    It is hoped that futureReports will be shorter than the present one, but owing.to theabnormal conditions prevailing during the past week, it was feltthat it was better to deal fully with the situation at the riskof extending the Report to a somewhat undue length. .Mr.Hodge further desires me to call attention/to therecommendations made in the last portion of Section 5 of theReport *I am, etc.The Secretary,. (Sgd.)D.J.Shackleton.War Cabinet,2,Whltehali Gardens.S.W./1I.H.L.2435II.-Report on the Labour Situation for the week ending May 23rd, 1917I. - STRIKES.The Munitions and Omnibus strikes which are the outstandingfeatures of the week, are dealt with in III and V of this report.In other trades there have been no stoppages of serious impor- -tanee.    The Army Contracts Department reports a number of small orPartial stoppages due to wages difficulties, &quot;victimization&quot; andother normal causes, but none of them were important or of anyduration.     In several firms In London employed in the surgicaltrades, however * stoppages have occurred in sympathy with thoengineering strike.   Attempts are being made tp induce engineers toreturn to work by pointing out the effect on wounded soldiers.   TheScientific instrument Makers who also struck for similar reasonshave returned to work.   The Shipyard Labour Department reports thatits work has been seriously affected by the engineers1 strike, butapart from this, it has only had to deal with minor stoppages dueto normal causes which have been &amp; ealt with by the Departmentslocal officers or referred to arbitration.
II. DISPUTES(a) In ProgressAs the resulf of conferences held by the Chief IndustrialOcmmifiionir,  the-serious /stoppage threatened m theCotton Weaving industry has been averted.   Terms have beenagreed upon, which will be announced to the operatives onSaturday and will probably be accepted.Conferences have also been held as regards the claimsput forward by the operatives in the Woollen industry.There is no likelihood of a stoppage, and failing an amicablesettlement as the result of the negotiations still proceed-ihg, both parties have agreed to arbitration.The Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses hasdemanded an increase   of 15% on all clothing manufactured infulfilment of War Office Contracts.   The Union approached theWar Office asking for assistance, and has been advised toattempt an amicable settlement with the employers,  or, fail-ing that, to submit the case for arbitration.The Leather Workers Federation and United Society ofJourneyman Curriers have made demands for increases in wages.The firms have notified the War Office -of the fact,  and havebeen advised to refer to arbitration,, failing an amicablesettlement.   There have been no stoppages heretofore andnone will be allowed.   A demand has been made by the MidlandLeather Trade Federation that all unskilled temporarylabourers should join their Union during the period of theiremployment.   It is stated that the employers favour the adopticof this.rule.The Chief Industrial Commissioner is dealing with thedispute concerning the seamen on the Forth East Coast wherea crew refused to sign on but did so on representations fromtheir Union.   An. application for an advance of  1 per monthmade by Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union to the most importantShipping Company usinz the Port of London is the subject ofnegotiation but no agreement has yet been reached.   He isalso dealing with the applications for advances of wages madeby dockers at Glasgow , Dundee and Aberdeen.   An arbitratorhas been appointed at Dundee, and it is anticipated thatarbitrat&amp;ios will be detailed for the other two disputes inthe course of the next few days.(b)    SETTLEDIn addition to the case reported above as settled, theCommittee on Production dealt with seven casesr during the lastweek in six of which an Award was issued, the seventh casebeing remanded for futher enquiry.   Since the reconstitutionof the Committee it has arranged.to hear 23 out of 26 casesin less than a week from the date of the receipt of referenceand more than half the cases have been heard within five daysof the receipt of reference.
III *   gSfrOHTS Qh DISTRICTSThe lack of organisation in the attempt to produce a generalstrike is evident from a consideration of the history of the move-Dents of the various districts during the last week.    One notablefeature of the strike has been the complete absence of disorder,but a feature even more notable is found in the lack of unanimity,specially in the London area.     The same day saw strikes commencingI   in some facories, while in others work was resumed.     The arrestof the ringleaders brought Barrow out, but did not prevent thereturn of Manchester to normal conditions of labour.E. COAST.    In the North-East Ooast area there has been no trouble ofany description^    Attempts to create unrest were made unsucoess-fully by the Shop Stewards who, it is reported, are likely toprove a menace to their own Societies in the future.tfDE. On the Clyde very determined efforts to induce a sympatheticstrike have been made by delegates from the strike centres inSngland.    Agitators from London visited the district on the 14thand 18th May,    After the arrest of the strike leaders a meetingwas held on the 20th May at which a Resolution, demanding theirimmediate release, was passed, and delegates were despatched toLondon to ascertain the state of affairs here*    It is everywherenoticeable that no reliance whatever is plaaed by strikers on thenews published in the papers.     This fact reinforces the demandmade by the &quot;Times&quot; and other journals, that the policy of secrecybe replaced by one of fresh air.     The Clyde Workers1 Committeehas agreed to support the strike if it is found that the allega-tions of the delegates from London are correct, and that Woolwich,Manchester, Liverpool and other areas are,, in fact, on strike.    Itseems improbable that this strike will now take place, but it hasbeen very narrowly averted.ARROW.       Barrow came out on the 19th on aooount of the arrests and5$ at the men are still on strike.     It is not expected thatthere will be any ohange until proceedings in the Bow Street PoliceCoftrt are c0ttolud^aiUt A strike at Barrow was finally effectedas a result of theAringleaders, followed by a meeting addressedby delegates from Sheffield and Manchester.    Morton, though hisactivities have been viewed with suspicion, both by a section ofthe men and by local authority, appears to have acted honestlythr oughout.^ASHIgE  The sequence of events in Lancashire and Cheshire has beenCHESHIRE  very confused.    In Manchester the men have practically allreturned, and, though &quot;there is a strong feeling about thearrests, attempts to get the men out again have been unsuccessful.It appears prcbBfcle that the deciding circumstance has been thewant of funds.     It has been agreed that the workers, who oanafford it, shall come out again on Thursday if prosecution of theleaders continues.     The Trade Card and Dilution Bill questionsnave receded entirely into the background.    At Liverpool theengineers remain out and at Birkenhead a consid arable number,especially those at Cammell Lairds, have not returned to work.-Je is* however, no public sympathy with the strikers wao arosaid to be disheartened.    At Crewe zhe engineers oame out on19th in view of the arrests and are still out.    At Salford thestrike is over as also at Blackburn and Bury and a large numberof the smaller manufacturing centres of Lancashire.     The^   threatened strike of weavers, etc. has, it is hoped, been avertedby the action of the Chief Industrial Commissioner.
YORKSHIRE ln Yorkshire the trouble is still acute.   In Sheffield-1   1        which may he looked upon as the storm centre, the men havedeoided to remain out until the Bow Street proceedings arccompleted.     Before the arrest of the ringleaders there weresigns of a weakening of their resolution, hut the newsenabled the extremists to prolong the stoppage.   The moresobor element are, however, now returning to work (May 23)and only the extremists arc obdurate.   The Strike Committee,(I which directed resumption of work, has been disavowed bythe anarchist section, which has formed a new committee andsucceeded in keeping about 1% of the strikers out.Leeds has completely resumed and the strike in that area hasnot been remarkable for any enthusiam.   There is considerableuneasiness among the textile workers at Bradford who aredemanding an increase in wages.   The matter is being dealtwith by the Chief Industrial Commissioner (see Section 11(a) ).The attempted strike at Coventry was prevented largely bythe action cf members of the Labour Advisory Committee.   Avery large meeting was held on the 13th May at which aunanimous resolution was passed that work should be resumed.Later in the same evening another meeting^s held at whichseveral of the most hot-headed leaders spoko, includingDinglcy and Cassidy,,   Seeing that there was little hope ofsuccess, they recommended resumption of work and immediateformation of strong Committees with the object of embarkationon further hostilities.   Subsequent reports, however, indicatethat the shop stewards arc exceedingly unpopular with the men,and the fact of the arrest of Dinglcy and Cassidy does notappear to have caused much interest.   The avoidance of troubleat Coventry, which has always been a storm centre, is a goodinstance of the results of courageous action on the part ofthe authorised Trade Union Leaders.LQNDOI The situation in London may new be characterised assatisfactory.   The meeting of the Licensed Vehicle Workersat the Euston Theatre on 13th May is said to have beenexceedingly      violent in tons, and it was addressed byseveral of tlw anarchist section among whom George Saundersand P.W,Watson were conspicuous.   The engineers have practi-oally all returned to duty with the exception of those ofthe Eleetsioal Trades Union, who are attempting to obtainfavourable terms from the Minister of Munitions on thequestion of protection from military service, for theirmembers.   Throughout the time of trouble, the operations ofthe Strike Committee were exceedingly carefully thought outand conducted.   This Committee was identical in personnel withtho London Shop Stewards Committee.   The place of assembly ofthe national Conference of Shop Stewards, held on l8th Maywas kept secret, delegates from the country reporting to theIntelligence Bureau, set up by the Committee, at Cbandos Hall,Maiden Lane, in order to ascertain the place of mooting.   Itis reported that there are now serious disagreements betweenthe Shop Stewards of the country and the London StrikeCommittee, as the latter refuses to bo bound by the Agreementsconcluded between representatives of the Shop Stewards, thoA. S.E. Executive, and the Government on Saturday last.It is noticeable that at a meeting of the   SocialistEemoturatic Party, hold on the 13th May, advice was offeredto Newcastle and Sheffield that they should refrain fromfighting until conclusion of the ^ar and the repeal of thodefence of the Realm Act, when they would be in a much stronger? position and must inevitably win.
- 5 -WALES The situation in South Y/ales is both complicated andinteresting.   Everything was quiet until the 18th May when ameeting was held, and addressed by delegates from otherstrike centres, et Llanelly where a strike was resolved upon.Others were held at 3wans&quot;ea where attempts to extract apromise to strike were unsuccessful.   On the 20th May afurther meeting wee held at Swansea, attended by delegatesfrom Llanelly, at which it was resolved that the strike atLlanelly should oommence the next day but that Swansea shouldwait until Wednesday, 23rd, and meanwhile send two delegatesto London to ascertain the state of affairs.   Attempts toinduce tie Swansea engineers to &quot;down tools&quot; are continuallyin progress but Swansea is reluctant, and these attempts areso far unsuccessful.    At Gerselnon idleness at two of thecollieries, affecting about 900 men in each case, is due tothe strike of a few firemen for a higher rate of wages.It is suggested that these strikes are looked upon withcomplacency by the management as transport is notavailable and the mines are consequently working short timein any case,OUTH COAST On the South Coast the engineers of Southampton cameout on strike on the 18th May but have since returned towork after three days1 idleness.IV.      PRESS OPIKIOriGeneral Agpsots1 of the Strike.Both the daily and the weekly press have beenremarkable for the number of articles dealing with thelabour situation and for ths multitude of suggestions, bothsound and unsound, which writers offer for dealing with theproblems concerned.    It is unnecessary to refer in detailto the articles of the daily press and it will suffice tomention the leader in the &quot;Times&quot; of 16th May recommendinga fresh air policy and immediate ventilation of the factsconnected with industrial unrest.   The &quot;Mdrning Post&quot; ispublishing a series of interesting and illuminatingarticles by a Trade Unionist, of which the first appeared onthe 21st instant.    Tbe &quot;Daily Mews&quot; Is also publishingpractically dailjr articles concerning themselves with thesituation, its oausee, and its remedies.   In general thechief criticisms are aimed at the policy of secrecy andfailure of certain Government Departments to keep the workingmen clearly informed of the meaning&apos; of new measures whichit has been found imperative to introduoe.The increasing rise in prices of articles cf food hasundoubtedly caused a feeling in some quarters that undueprofits are being amassed by the middleman and that inthis way, notwithstanding the instance of the excessprofits duty, an unfair share of the sacrifices entailedby the War is being borne by the working classes.   Thisis apparent from the prominent position allotted to anarticle on food supply and distribution by the &quot;WoolwichPioneer&quot; of 18th May under the needing &quot;POOD SUPPLY ANDDISTRIBUTION.   WE WILL BE DELIVERED PROM TEE PROFITEER&quot;,together with a leading article in the seme issue on therioolwioh Food Conference.    The question is also referredto by the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; of 17th May, which points outthat the limited capacity of the purchasing power of theworking classes practically effects compulsory rationing.The same paper also points out that the working classcannot eat less without impairing their efficiency.
^AOEJDISCUBSIOH.      A groat deal has been written during the week ontne subject of Peace.     This has doubtless been encouraged bythe announcement of the Russian Provisional Government.    Asrather remarkable instances of expression of sound views on thissubject the issue of &quot;Justice&quot; of IVth May, may be instanced,Tho meaning of the phrase &quot;no annexations&quot; is analysed, and itis pointed out that it has only been adopted by the MajoritySocialists in Germany, since their prospects of winning the warhad waned.    On tho question of indemnities it is asked howI restoration and reparation are to bo made to Belgium and JSranceif no indemnity is to be taken from Germany.     It concludeswith the opinion that the phrase &quot;Peaoe without annexations andindemnities&quot; is at present purely speoious*&quot;Porward&quot; the organ of tho Clyde Workors&apos; Committee whichis not a paper prone to moderate views, calls, in its issueof 19th May, for a clearer expression of socialistic aims and fora definition of their terms.     The paper is not prepared toaccept or recommend a peace without annexations or indemnitiesuntil the central powers have clearly stated what they intend.It adds &quot;Almost every of for of the Chancellor proved on oxamina-tion to depend on the establishment of an impregnable CentralGerman Power, which, could from its position of vantage, dominateEurope and thence the world.&quot;        &apos;On tho other hand there are reports of meetings at Glasgowand elsewhere where the wildest poace talk appears to have beenreceived with general acclamation.     The United Socialist Councilof the I. L. P. and the British Socialist Party have calleddelegates to a joint conforence on June 3rd at Leeds in favour ofa definite action to secure peace.    Though this Council has notitself adopted the oatchword &quot;Peace without annexations andindemnities&quot; the *&amp;ole trend of thejhotioe calling a conferenceprovos tho organisers to bo In sympathy with this cry.There is a remarkable article containing muda sound argumenton the first page of the &quot;British Citizen^ of 11th May which pointsout that the present industrial unrest is largely caused by abody of men whose political fortunes are involved in securing apremature and disastrous peace.     The Woolwich Organiser of theWorkers1 Union expressed a similar view at a mass meeting inconnection with the strike, at which he successfully urged hishearers to have nothing to do with it *SUSST^t        As was to bo expeoted, the events in Russia occupiedthe close attention of the labour press.    As an instance ofunsound argument may be mentioned.an article in tho &quot;Labour Leader&quot;of 17th May, quoting a portion of the appeal issued by thoCouncil of workmen&apos;s and Soldiers1 Delegates, addressed tosocialists of all countries.     That manifesto inter alia says:-&quot;Whatever may be the vioiseitudes of fortune of the War, theImperialists of all oountrios are everywhere victorious in thisstruggle which has given them and is giving them fantastioprofits, is gathering in their hands enormous capitals and isendowing them with unheard of pa? or over labour and over thovery lives of the workmen.     Per this reason the wcrkers of allcountries are defeated and are making, on the altar of Imperialism,numberless sacrifices in life, health, well-beiisg, and liberty&quot;, his extract is, according to the &quot;Labour Loader&quot; a descriptionof the plight of thousands of munition workers at present onstrike in Great Britain.     It is also noticeable that at theGlasgow meeting on 13th May, Mr.George Laaisbury announced thatH      proximate appointment of workmen1s and soldiers1 delegates inLondon.
USPICION There are widespread hints of suspicion on the part&quot;^oT of the workmen as to the intentions of the Government andnVEHKMERT.   as to the effect of the measures at present in contem--J^-^-   plation.   It is alleged that the Trade Union Officialshave &quot;been throttled by the Ma&amp;ition Acts and this hasresulted in the destruction of men&apos;s confidence in their(jfi officials and in a belief that the officials havesacrificed the interest of the workers in order-   toidentify themselves with the Government.   The &quot;New Age&quot;,the &quot;New Witness&quot; and the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; alladvertise this suspicion.   It is also considered thatthe extension of the dilution will lead to unemploymentafter the War and the &quot;New Statesmen.&quot; refers to thewell-known misapprehension on the part of the workersthat dilution is intended to continue after peace hasbeen declared.   The following extract from the &quot;WoolwichPioneer&quot; of 18th May illustrates the attitude taken upby many of the papers:-   &quot;What workmen, the countryover, have to realise is that the fundamental principle- the revolt of the engineers - is to fight for themaintenance of civil and industrial liberties againsta Government enshrouded in a cloak of secrecy andmystery&quot;.   Again &quot;How deep rooted is the feeling ofsuspicion against the Government is shown by theimportant meeting of the Executives of the LabrourTriple Alliance on Wednesday, which passed a resolutionembodying this decision, warning the responsibleparties against the dangers of any efforts open orhidden to destroy the influence of Trade Unionism bylabour compulsion &quot;..........&quot;   The text of the resolu-tion commenced &quot;That this meeting observes with mis-giving the various signs of attempts to introduce bygradual stages the principle of industrial compulsion&quot;.The above short review of the press emphasisesthe necessity that some Step should be taken toprovide the working class with accurate informationas to the intentions of the Governemnt and soundexposition of the trend and effect of the politicalhappenings both in this, in allied and in enemycountries.
/of5. GENERAL REMARKS.The present strike is not only a. very serious matterfrom the point&apos;of view of the conduct of the War because it isseriously retarding the output of munitions, hut also as beingthe symptom of a deep-seated unrest in the minis of a section ofthe civil population, which, unless removed, may make it diffi-cult to prosecute the Vrar at all.   An attempt  Till therefore bemade to analyse its causes, and to suggest some remedies for itat rather greater length than will be usual in the case of theseReports.CAUSES.1-   Industrial. The industrial causes of unrest among theskilled workmen&quot;are sufficiently well-known to require no furtherexplanation.   At the moment the question of dilution on privatework is the most prominent among them, and there is no doubt thatthi3 is by far the most important of the immediate causes of thestrike.   It could not have reached its actual magnitude, however,but for the discontent previously existing on account of the gener-al restrictions on liberty entailed by the Munitions Act, such asthe requirement of leaving certificates, the working of the Muni-tions Tribunals, and the abolition of the right to strike.   More-over the Introduction of dilution on private work In the face of theassurance given earlier in the War that it was to apply only tomunitions work is not merely a question of the moment, but has bredconsiderable fear as to the future.   It is alleged and widely be-lleved that the employers are scheming to destroy the safeguardsprocured by trade unionism and even trade-unionism itself, and thatthe Government does not Intend to fulfil the pledges given, whilethe executives of the trade unions are powerless to protect theirmembers.The Trade unions themselves have not given aclear lead on the question of future conditions, and until they do -so the view that unless the men act for themselves now, they willfind themselves at the end of war shorn of their protections andprivileges without anything in exchange, is bound to command agood deal of support among^the skilled trades, who know that theydo not intend to lose the footing; they have gained in the skilledoccupations.   The real importance of these questions may be judgedby the fact that the unrest is far greater in the engineering thanin the shipbuilding trades, wbere dilution has not been possiblein anyJhing like the same degree;   and, from them is derived theprincipal strength of the Shop Stewards&apos; movement.The general result is an atmosphere of uncer-tainty and distrust in the engineering,trades, which must be dis-sipated if future troubles are to be avoided. *2t   General,      There is in this as in all belligerent countr-ies a growing weariness and exhaustion due to the strain of the War,aggravated in the case of manual workers by the physical effortswi0h ^hey have put fortl1 Y/itil little interruption durina the nasti*wo and a half years.   There Is also a much more vivid realisation
ISof the actual horrors of war due to the large number of men whohave returned home with the experience of it fresh upon them, andthe large number of casualties due to the great number of men nowengaged.Further, the essential aims and causes of the war havetended to become obscured and forgotten.   Public memory is aptto be short, and not only has the significance of the German atro-cities been to some extent forgotten, but their very heinousnesshas been palliated by the blunting of susceptibilities due totheir constant repetition.Two further causes of a general kind are the v/orking ofthe Millatry Service Acts, and the Food question.- As regards theformer, the urgent need for further men is not generally under-stood^ and having been told that this was an &quot;Engineers     ar&quot; andhaving seen large numbers of engineers brought back from thetrenches to the Workshops., the v/orking men do not understand whythe process Is now reversed.   The difficulty over the Trade CardScheme Is probably quite as much due to the suspicion that theWar Office is making reckless and unnecessary/ demands as to theaversion to military service on the part of some of the men whoare likely to be affected.   As regards the Food question, there isno evidence that this has really become acute, but it is a naturalsource of irritation and lends Itself to exploitation by theagitators.   In so far as the latter are able to point to actualcases in profiteering they make a real impression on all classes.EFFECTS.The combination of these sets of causes has produceda movement of a double character.   On the industrial side, theShop Stewards representing the men of all grades and nominatedfor or elected by the Shops themselves have: been able to usurpthe authority of the responsible Unions by representing them ashelpless and in the hands of the Government * and by urging themen to take matters into their own hands if they are to save them-selves from losing further liberties and privileges.   Some ofthese men are of the usual agitator type, who are ready to takeany opportunity to revolt against authority, but most of themare really representative of the men&apos;s opinions, with which theyare far more closely in touch than the Executives of the TradeUnions.   On the other hand* some of these men have taken ad-vantage of the vague desire for peace mentioned above to re-present that peace would be possible but for the ambitions ofthe Government to annexe territory.   These two lines of pro-paganda have both been pursued b;: an important section of theShops Stewards, and there Is evidence that some of them areclosely linked with the avowedly pacifist groups, who hope tobring the war workers to refuse to turn out munitions.   The factthat they come before the men as champions of the industrialgrievances they feel ensures a sympathetic hearing for any otherviews they may put forwardThe extremist section among Shop-Stewards have re-ceived considerable encouragement from the recent events in Russia,which have necessarily had an unsettling effect, and by the con-troversy In regard to peace terms in that country which has creat-ed the impression that Great Britain has an ulterior motive in con-tinuing the war beyond the destruction of German militarism.   Thepacifist elements have always been careful to avoid any statementof their peace terms, and by doing so they have striven to fosterthe idea that peace would now be procurable on the condition of re-storing Belgium, Serbia, Poland, and Alsace Lorraine, together witheffective guarantees against German aggression.   Many people/probably
probably believe that such a peace could bo had now. if only theGovernment would renounce its ulterior ambitions.Apart from the industrial and the pacifist elements ofunrest there is also the purely revolutionary element, which, thoughprobably negligible in itself, thrives on the general uncertaintyof opinion which has been created.   It would probably be a greatmistake, to suppose that the bulk of working-class opinion was any-thing but strongly patriotic, but there has been little effort to(peet the insidious propaganda which has been carried on, and unlesssome effort is made in this direction It may be expected that un-rest will continue rather than diminish.fli3HRDI&amp;?.1&apos;   Industrial, (a) On the question of dilution the Ministryof Munitions will no doubt go as far as it is possible to go in thedirection of meeting objections raised without sacrificing theprinciple.    It is perhaps worth considering again whether it wouldnot be possible to abolish the requirement of leaving certificatesaltogether.   A concession of this kind at the present moment wouldbe welcomed aS a real earnest of sympathy on the part of theGovernment and would be taken &amp;3 evincing a desire to avoid causingmore hardship than was inevitable for the successful prosecution ofthe War.   This Department is not in a position to say how strongthe case for leaving certificates is at the presant stage, and theabove suggestion is not meant to be more than a suggestion.(b).   Proposals in regard co a Committee of Inquiry have al-ready been submitted.   SuVh a Committee will no doubt help to ven-tilate grievances and suggest remedies.(c).   It will be necessary io consider the result upon theShop Stewards&apos; movement of the strike and whether any remedies canbe devised to prevent its being a purely unconstitutional and rebelmovement.   It is proposed to deal with this question next week,when it should be possible to get a clearer view of the situation.2,   General.   The chief need at the present moment is for abetter education of the working-classes as to the actual militarysituation and needs, the aims of the Allies so far as it Is pos-stble to define them, and the results that would inevitably followfrom an inconclusive peace.    In order to bring points of this kindhome, press propaganda, and even speeches delivered in London arenot sufficient.   What Is required Is to give the men themselvesI  the opportunity of listening to somebody who is more or less vergedin the situation, and who will act as an antidote to the speakersthey are accustomed to hear.At present there Is no thought of organized effort tocontradict mis-statements whether made verbally or in the press.The men who hold sound opinions are usually more silent than those,,7ho take an extreme line. wHh the result that the latter have themonopoly of the street oratory which has a considerable influencein the political education of working men.What is really wanted, tnersfore., is an organized effortto create a right atmosphere throughout the country.   This could bedone if Members of Parliament  - and particularly Labour Members -ftere to speak regularly in Industrial centres, but it is of almostgreater importance that there should be a local orator representingthe orthodox element in the trade unions, constantly prepared totake up the cudgels against the extremists and supplied with suchinformation as they may. require for the purpose,  ytn peace time pro-paganda of this nature is carried out on a large scale by the Partymachines and it is suggested that the same machines might now be used*in order to deal with the questions which are agitatlrm the minds ofthe working classes.D.J.S.24.5.17.Ministry of Labour.
