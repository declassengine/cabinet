It4QFro??! Viceroy, Foreign Department, 24th May 1917.(Received at India Office, 10.15 p.m.)Secret. Mahsuds. Following from Political&quot;Agent, Wano, 20th May: &quot;I have seen leading Wano Wazir Maliks of all&quot; sections here to-day andhave discussed Wazir situation with them. Mullah Hamzul has tried tostir up. the tribes for Jehad and has pointed out that in spite of repeatedserious outrages by the Mahsuds involving death of many British officersand sepoys and the loss of hundreds of rifles, Government has taken noaction against tribe. He has also told thein that Government is anxious toabandon Agency but cannot do so owing to impossibility of removing ourgarrison. He has boasted that no more convoys will be allowed to travelthrough Gomal. Mullah succeeded in inducing a few Toji Khel andShikaiwal Waziris to make a demonstration against Wana Tahsil, but thisfailed completely owing to loyalty of Waziris generally who refused to haveanything to do with it. Maliks whom I have seen assure me of their loyaltyto the British Government, but they state that our present weakness iseverywhere realised and advise display of force to counteract Mullah&apos;sarguments. This scantiness of troops certainly runs a risk. MahsudsLashkar is still assembling at Barwand with the present intention ofbesieging Sarwekai.&quot;
