Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.SECTIOI!   D.i.   i   , ii i .....pm /005WEEKLY REPORT OK GREECE.   V.May 29, 1917.The Athens Government and the Entente Powers.A last attempt Is to he made to &quot;effect a reconciliationbetween the Vonizelist and Royalist parties&quot; and ?ir- Zaimis islooked to as the natural, and indeed the only person to offeetsuch a reconciliation.   The decision of tho Paris Conferenceand the subsequent policy of the Entente Powers in conformitywith that decision will, it is hoped, serve both as an encourage-ment and a warning to the Athens Government.   If tho lattercan show that it is assiduously and successfully working forsuch a reconciliation and that it wishes for a closer understanding?;ith the Protecting Powers, It is to bo assured of lessstringent economic restrictions and more freedom of actionin the policing of the country.   If, on the contrary, frombad faith or impotence it fails to improve the situation itwill be shown that the Entente&apos;s tolerance cannot be indefinitelyprolonged - &quot;should the King and tho Greek Government at Athensfail to assist in promoting this policy, the Allied Governmentsmay be compelled to consider the deposition of the King&quot;.The two questions, therefore, at onco arise - does I!rZaimis wish for and can he, if he wishes, effeot any reconciliatiorbetween the Royalists and Venizelists?     (1) To the first questionthe answer seems to be &quot;Yes&quot; - but with a reservation.   Ilr Zaimiscertainly wishes a united Greece.   Himself originally a friend ofMr Venizelos and not in any sense a party politician, he has no
personal or political reasons for bitter opposition to him.On the other hand he disapproved of the Revolution and is nowin office as Prime Minister of a King whom Venizelists lookon as a traitor to his country.   He could hardly then workfor any reconciliation i&amp;ich did not, whether openly or not,base itself on a condemnation of the revolutionary movement.Mr Zaimis must know that it is impossible that the Venizelistsshould accept any such terms.   His position, therefore, though notintentionally one of duplicity, is essentially a false one.He is simply trying to tide the country over an extraordinarilydifficult political and economic crisis, with no policy but thatof opportunism and instead of plans merely optimistic prophecies.His justification would, of course, he that it is probablybetter to temporise than to leave others in power who wouldcertainly make things worse.   The situation might always improvein unforeseen v/ays;   and in any case some time is gained andcivil war for a while averted.As to (2) Mr Zaimis1 power to effect any such reconciliation,it has already been pointed out in Weekly Reports III and IVthat he has no backing behind him.     The Royalist factions andanti-Venizelistt parties support him only on condition that hedoes not &quot;try to bridge (the gulf between) Athens and Saloniki&quot; -yet this is the very raison dretre of his Government!     Mr- Zaimisis to them merely a convenient screen against the Entente fortheir intrigues.   These parties are fundamentally - both frominterest and party passion - anti-Venizelist.   There is noteven a possibility of their wishing for a reconciliation.Yet without them Mr Zaimis has no support, for he has no partyof his own.   On the other hand, the Venizelists (as shown inWeekly Report III) have thrown over Mr Zaimis as a possible leaderor mediator.   This is confirmed by Mr Venizeloa&apos; vigorous
representations to Lord Granville on May 22.This attitude of the Venizelists will be strengthened bythe decision of the Paris Conference.   The increasing numbersof their forces, their first successes in the field and the almostunanimous approval of the French, British and American pressdaily encourage them to push on with their full programme.While they chafe at, they understand, the restrictions imposedon them by Entente diplomacy;   they are, of course, perfectlyacquainted with the situation created by Italy&apos;s attitude.   Butthey do not believe this situation will be indefinitely prolonged.The&quot;diplomatic changes contemplated at Athens and the proposedoccupation of Thessalian ports by General Sarrail&apos;s troops willconfirm the Venizelists in this attitude.   The crisis inThessalymust soon come to a head.   It is, however, to be hoped that theadhesion of Thessaly to the National Movement - which after theParis Conference^ decision is only a matter of time - shall beeffected without unnecessary bloodshed.   The population beingalmost wholly Venizelist - except   for the extreme South and acertain number of the big landowners and the usual partypoliticians - could easily be brought under the Government ofSaloniki.   The one danger would lie in the &quot;increase of the forcesat the disposal of the authorities at Athens and in the pro-vinces&quot; (suggested by Sir F. Elliot), if in &quot;the provinces&quot;Thesoaly is intended to be included.On the question of the Thessalian harvest it looks as thoughI-r Zaimis is playing a rather curious game.   He does not objectto the control of the stocks by the &quot;Allied Board at Athens, butdosires that the Greek Government should finance the purchase ofthe harvest on its ow n account and without assistance.
Further he suggests that half the surplus stock should be reservedby the Greek Government for the use of the urban population inThessaly.   If this were done the Athens Government would have inits hands a powerful hold over the Thessalian population and couldeffectually influence their.political decision    at a time whenthe Entente Powers would be allowing Central Greece and thePeloponnese to make themselves economically independent for a longtime of our sea power.   It is hard to see how such a coursewould do anything but stiffen the Athens Government in its attitudetowards Saloniki and the Entente Powers.With the occupation of Levkas, all the Ionian Islands havenow joined the National Movement.A.W.A.L.May 29, 1917.
