267SECRET.OPERATIONSFrom: -General Barter,To: -C . 110 . S .May 25th; 1917.Handed in 1.10 a,m.1059&apos;,   24th.In conversation this morning Prince TROUBETTSEIOI,head of diplomatic section at G.H.Q., who has justr returnedfrom Petrograd,  informed me-that in his opinion, the political,situation as it affects the military question has somewhatimproved.Committee of Soldiers&apos; and   or k-men&apos; s delegateshave recognised that failure in the military sense willseriously prejudice their own position in the eyes of thepeople., and only a small minority of less than one tenthare against the earliest possible re-establishment ofproper discipline, and of organising for vigorous offensiveat most favourable point.They now consider that only military success willbind together the revolutionary parties as distinguishedfrom the anarchist party, and lay solid foundation for theinternal reforms which they desire to accomplish.The inclusion of delegates of Committee of Workmenand. Soldiers in the Government, assures Government ofCommittee^ support in the matter of offensive operations.Prince Troubettskioi believes that more favourable conditionof morale is gradually taking place amongst troops at fronts.This re-action he largely attributes to tendency on part ofsoldiers &quot;to return to religious thought after turmoil ofpast two months, and to the efforts of military chaplainswho are very patriotic and not at all pacifist to stimulatepatriotism
&amp; 0 0* s*.patriotism amoiigot the troops *   I pointed out to Troubett-*skioi that X did not think the Government was sending enougheloquent and sincere agents to the front to harangue troopsand institute coun*ter*-propaganda in opposition to pacifistcampaign.I also represented to him that in the fatter ofsaluting Government did not recognise that salute ofsoldiers was made not to the individual but to the uniformhe wore, as representative of Government,  and nation*   Thisidea struck him and he is going to put it before the nev/Minister of War when he rettfras to Potrograd in a few days&quot;time,It is not, however, a favourable sign that Alexieff&apos;s&quot;patriotic speech, which I have already reported, at conferenceof officers last Sunday, in which he&apos; vehemently urged res-toration of discipline, but at the same time, disclaimedall political intervention, has hot been allowed to appear inthe .Petrograd papers, although the Moscow papers have repro-duced it8On the-whole, however, there is rather more optimisticfeeling, that a few days ago, amongst the General Staff.    Thisimpression is confirmed by opinion of Alexieff himself, who,this evening expressed: his belief to me that discipline andmorale at front were showing scorns slight o&amp;gns of improve-ment,He thinks visit of new Minister of War to S*W*front, where he is going with intention of exhorting ttfoopsto patriotism and discipline may be productive of much good,as he is at present by far the most popular man in Russiaand is believed to be honest in purpose,     He passed through.G.H.Q, last night Without,.stopping, but is expected to visitAlexieff here about June 3rd,Telegrams have-;been-received, during-last two days rom     .
from several regiments on front, expressing theiropinion that Russian army should, as soon as possible,make vigorous  offensive.     Other messages from regimentson front have been received previously expressing theirreadiness to obey orders, but nothing so energeticallyexplicit as those just received.     This is looked uponas being a favourable indication.
