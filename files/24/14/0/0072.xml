From Political Resident, Aden, 27th May 1917.(Repeated to Foreign, Simla, and High Commissioner, Cairo.)(Received at India Office, 9.30 p.m.)A.P. I am well aware of Colonel Jacob&apos;s . views but I think heave been influenced by a persona] interview with messengers. Iagree that supporters are men of straAv : as far as I can learn nearlythe most influential Arab leaders in Yemen are behind confederacy, theAbdulla Sultan heretofore a pronounced supporter of the Imam is in favourof supporting confederacy. I am aware of personal hostility of Idrisi toImam and of his ambition, he is cognizant of scheme but not of Imamdesignate.   The confederacy desires an Imam of Imamic race.The present Imam has been neutral but the neutrality has been towardsthe Turks benevolent possibly unavoidably so.Recent reports, one only yesterday, refer to his communicating withSaid Pasha in Lahej and asking for his help against Idrisi. No doubt heknows we have already helped Idrisi though not designedly against him.I consider intrigues are going on between Idrisi and Italians but Idrisi putsus before Italians though he does not refuse what he can get from them.Our command of the sea gives us considerable control over Idrisi.The confederacy at present are pronouncedly pro-British. They maybecome pro-Italian.I allow that confederacy must be difficult to control but we should beable to commit them in the first place against Turks. 1 have no wish tomodify my views.
