gi^a fl. r u *?* v /JG.T-. 829 118WAB -OABISET.&apos; Intelligence Bureau,Department of Informs tier.SB0TIQ13 P. P*goSpecial, Memorandum on Serbian Conspiracy Trial.2 nd. ivlay, 1917.At my. request Mrc Seton :Jatson has contributed thefollowing Memorandum on the importance of the recent Serbian con-spiracy.trial which has ended in,the condemnation of General DamianPopovi6 and his associates.. (Initialled)     A.W.A.L.lews has reached London that sentence of d-eath-has beenpassed by a Serbian .Court Martial sitting in Salonica uponGeneral Damian Popcvicf--and several -other officers implicated in thealleged conspiracy against the life of&apos;the Prince. Regent.    It&quot;is,of course, impossible to venture an opinion upon their guilt&apos;orinnocence, since the whole affair has been shrouded- in mystery formonths past.    It is, however, necessary&apos;to emphasise the deplorableeffects already noticeable as the result of the steps taken by theSerbian Government&quot; against so many officers of high merit and dis-tinction.      Among the 50 or so; implicated are included several menwho enjoyed the special confidence of the late. Volvode Putnik - e..g.Colonel Milovanovitch, one of the best officers on the HeadquartersStaff during, the Balkan Wars and later on a go-between of Nish andAthens - and. also some officers, whose promotion had been unusuallyrapid owing to- their great- ability.iftor the great Serbian retreat of December 1915, thePashitch Cabinet, removed f.ron: their commands the Volvo de Putnikand almost all theArmy --chiefs:    and,- rightly or wrongly, thiswas very widely interpreted as an attempt on the part of thepoliticians/
politicians to shift the blame for the catastrophe on to theshoulders of the military.  -So drastic a clearance naturallycreated many malcontents in the army, and their numbers havesteadily grown ever since,&apos; The inevitable result, has been tointroduce, a political element into purely military affairs andto throw.the dispossessed officers into the arms of opponentsof the Pashitch regime.   Here again it is being very freelyhinted, that the.authorities welcomed any opportunity of riddingthemselves of dangerous critics and rivals.-HO evidence has been allowed to transpire as to.thealleged plot, and the fact, that so many officers of high ..reputation were involved has aroused in many Serbian quartersdoubts and suspicion, besides having a very bad effect upon thearmy itself, . Should the death sentence be confirmed, therewould he grave danger of the army being split into two rivalfactions and a consequent reversion to the fends Which wereonce the curse of Serbia.. There is a wide feeling that General Popovie&apos;8 pastrecord (he was one of the officers&apos; implicated in the Regicideof. .1903, though not, one of the actual murderers) Is beingexploited against him.Their execution would provide the German and,, aboveall, the Austrian propagandists with a&apos;dmiralile;Wft3*t^J&amp;iwd- lor. prdringthe insecure position and unscrupulous character of the: Karageorge-vitch dynasty and its instruments,, It.would also nave a specially deplorable effect inicussia at a moment;-when the -Russians; have abolished the death   .sentence, ,and.would.alienate Russian public .-Bympa-thy from Serbia,If the. above estimate bo correct, the execution iscertainly contrary-to the interests of the allied Governments, astending to produce.-internal complications In Serbia and todiscredit her reputation abroad, -   .
