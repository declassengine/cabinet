From Viceroy, 21st May 1917.(Received at India Office 22nd May, 10.30 a.m.)Secret.&quot; &quot;Mahsuds.1. After carefully reconsidering Mahsud situation we are forced toconclusion that present policy of passive defence is no longer tenable.Hostile sections are hopelessly committed and their successes against ourtroops have reacted seriously on neutral sections, and also probably onDarwesh Khel Waziris. Unless we can demonstrate our power to hit backeffectively we may be confronted with general rising between Kurram andGonral Rivers with danger of further extensions. Successful reprisals offeronly hope of suppressing hostile sections and &quot;keeping others from joining.Situation has also assumed military character which presents followingfactors : 2. (a) We estimate Mahsud armed strength at 11,450 with 333. magazinerifles and 3,349 breech-loading rifles.(b) Present position is that southern Mahsuds have barred our lines ofcommunication well supported by Gwaleri Pass to Kajari Kach, Wana, andSarwekai. Immediate operations are necessary to provision and stock theseposts.(c) Their evacuation would be impossible on both political and militarygrounds. It would open our protected districts of Derajat and Zhob toMahsud incursions and thereby necessitate a considerable increase inpermanent garrisons of those areas.-(d) For the purpose of retaliation an accessible and suitable objective insouthern Waziristan is the cultivated Khaisora Valley, inhabited by mosthostile section situated 12 to 14 miles from Wana.(c) We have accordingly approved of plan for concentrating 2 brigadeswith 12 guns, and 2 companies Sappers at Wana for this purpose, holdinglines of communication the posts and the Derajat with H regiments cavalryand 6 battalions in addition to the militia. Bannu garrison will be reinforcedby 2 battalions so as to be ready for eventualities. One-battalion Pioneerswill be employed on road-making in Gomal; and another, assisted by triballabour, in the Tochi.The above troops, together with existing Bannu Brigade, constitutingWaziristan Field Force under the immediate command of General Benyon,who reports to General Officer Commanding, Northern Army.(/) Operations for the reopening of the lines of communication are nowin progress, and we estimate that by the 20th June the two brigades shouldbe concentrated at Wana in readiness to strike, and we hope to completeoperations before the Id which falls about 21st July, thus taking advantageof tribal inertia during Ramazan. At the same time we feel we cannotprudently reckon on reducing Waziristan Field Force before September, andthat is the reason we have obtained battalions destined for East Africa andEgypt.3. We fully realize our larger commitments to the Empire and necessityfor fulfilling these, and would gladly avoid this diversion were it practicable.But we are reluctantly forced to face fact that a passive defence is no longerpossible, and that proposed punitive measures alone offer some hope ofbringing Mahsuds to their senses, and prevent spread of trouble.
