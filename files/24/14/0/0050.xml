SHIPPING    STRATEGYIN    THEATLANTICTHE  PROBLEM  OP   INDIANOTES ON THE MEMORANDUM BY THE REVENUESECRETARY OP THE INDIA OPPICE.
W SHIPPING STBATESGY IN THE ATLANTIC. -THE PROBLEM Off INDIA.Notes on the Memorandum by the Revenue Secretaryt of the India Office.(l)    I have read Mr. Kershaw&apos;s deeply interestingmemorandum dated May 22nd.    Mr. Kershaw seems to think thatthe considerations which he brings forward have not.beensufficiently weighed by me, and that they cast doubt upon whatI wrote in my memorandum of May 4th, when I said that:&quot;It is necessary to realise that it is possiblefor the United Kingdom and her Allies to liveand to wage war by virtue of:-(a) Their own resources;(b) The resources of the North American Continent;with the addition of a comparatively trifling amountof cargo brought from other sources.&quot;(2)    It seems to me that no-one who considers therelative natural resources of Germany and the United Kingdomcan doubt the truth of this proposition.    Germany, save inrespect of her area and one or two quite exceptional products,such as potash and zinc, is a poor country, the sources ofher wealth being precisely those of the United Kingdom, viz:Coal and Iron.    So true is this that in the year 1913, theyear before the war broke out, the imports for home consumptioninto the German Empire were five-sixths as great as theimports for home consumption into the United Kingdom.  That isto say, measured by commercial demand, Germany was largelydependent upon foreign supplies to maintain her economicposition.    It is well known that in respect of many importantraw materials her imports were far^greater than ours.
(3)     Yet, in spite of this extraordinary pre-wardependence upon imports, a dependence only second to our own,Germany has for nearly three years carried on successfully.The blockade became effective to a very large degree as soonas the war broke out, although it is true that for a yearafterwards Germany actually received through the countriescontiguous to her a small proportion of her old supplies.Towards the end of 1915 this proportion became very smallindeed, and in 1916 the blockade was so far made effectivethat the imports of essential materials into Germany becamenegligible.    I feel sure that if Mr. Kershaw will considerthese undoubted facts for a moment he cannot fail to be struckwith the truth of the proposition set out in the 17th para-graph of my memorandum:-&quot;It is a much simpler thing for us to exist withAmerican aid than for Germany to live upon herself&quot;.(4)    It is, I contend, absolutely true that if we weredebarred by an effective blockade from trading with any othercountries in the world except the United States and Canada, wecould live and carry on this war.    Let it be observed that ifthis proposal is not true then something else is true, and thatis that Germany must be inhabited by a people infinitelysuperior in natural gifts to those inhabiting the UnitedKingdom, Canada and America.(5) Nevertheless, I value Mr. Kershaw&apos;s details veryhighly because they are precisely what we must consider inworking
working out my proposals in practice.    The interests ofIndia must &quot;be studied most carefully, as long as we donot consider them as superior to the interests of theEmpire as a whole.    We must recognise, for example,that India is deeply interested in the export of tea,and of rice, and other desirable commodities, but wemust not be tempted to regard those exports as, in thelast resort, essential for our people.   Rice is a goodfood, but it is in actual fact one of the least valuableof the oereals, and if, by a short sea voyage, we canget a superior cereal, it may be that in circumstancesof danger created by a shortage of tonnage, it becomesconsistent with war economy to use a ship on the saferand shorter route to get a better cereal rather than touse it to get Indian rice.     If such a decision weretaken it would be necessary to have regard to Indianfinancial interests, but I hope Mr. Kershaw will forgiveme if I point out that it is hardly conclusive for himto say on thi,s head:&quot;RICE.- 50,000 tons monthly are required inthe United Kingdom.   This must be broughtfrom Burma.&quot;(6)    To pass to other details, Mr. Kershaw1smemorandum hardly gives a true perspective of our importsfrom India.    That perspective is given by tho followingtable:-
Imports from India into United Kingdom fcr Hems Consumption.9(In million  ).Prom	1911	1912	1913	1914	1915British India	; 34	40	36	33	50ill the World	577	633	659	601	753It will he seen that in the years 1911 - 1915,being three years of peace and two years of war, theimports from India into the United Kingdom have variedbetween 5j per cent, and &amp;k per cent, of our total imports.Of these imports what part can be regarded as essentialto the United Kingdom in the sense that we cannot get it,or any substitute for it, from North America?      Here isan analysis of the 1915 figuresImports

It will be seen that Column B amounts to  22,000,000or 44 per cent of the total of  50,000,000 worth of Indianimports into the United Kingdom in 1915.    Of this as much as 9,000,000 is represented by tea.(7)    But this is to deal with the imports of 1915, sincewhich date import restrictions of a drastic character haveseriously affecte.1 the articles in Column B.(8)    For June, it is estimated, our imports from India,out of a total . &quot;import of about 3,000,000 tons, will be only:-TonsPace 40,000Tea 10,000Manganese Ore 41,000Oils and i?ats 3i,000Othor articles 29,000Total 150,000It will be seen that of this 150,000 tons the greaterpart is by no means indispensable or not to be obtained fromother and nearer sources.These considerations seem to shew that the problemof doing without Indian supplies is not really as serious asis suggested in the memorandum.    Germany is absolutely cutoff from the Indian market, but manages to survive.    How muchbetter she could survive if, although cut off from the Indianmarket, she had free access to the United States and Canada.What would the Germans not give to be in the happy position ofbeing cut off from India and yet freely able to import fromthe United States and Canada?    To suggest that we have notingenuity enough and resource enough to live and fight eventhough We are in an infinitely better position than Germany isreally
reaHj^to^fleet iip^^ The fact of thematter is that we have been so spoiled by^the^ixciiinsl^oes^of the war that we have become persuaded that we cannot dowhat we really can do.(9)    What I have said covers Mr. Kershawfs examinationof the policy as far as it goes, but it may be well to dealwith the important question raised in his last paragraph, inwhich he refers to the naval issue.    On this head it may bewell to observe that the carrying out of my proposal wouldplace the German Admiralty in a curious dilemma.    Let usimagine the scheme brought to fruition with, for the sake ofargument, 800 vessels employed in the North Atlantic and 400trading in other routes.    (As a matter of fact the countrycould live and fight with far less than 400 ships on otherthan North Atlantic routes).    The German Admiralty would thenhave to decide whether to scatter their submarines as now, orwhether to concentrate them all in the Atlantic.    If they didthe former then a great relative immunity from attack wouldobtain in the North Atlantic.    If they did the latter then agreat degree of immunity would arise for the vessels not inthe North Atlantic.    In either case we should stand to gain.If the Germans concentrated their submarines in the Atlanticwe could afford to concentrate our defence there, knowingthat the other routes would be relatively safe.    If, on theother hand, the Germans made their dispositions very much asat present, then the Atlantic convoys would be relatively safe.(10)    I observe that the memorandum states that my proposalis &quot;not a new one&apos;,?.    It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to offerany comment upon that, but I may point out that the essence ofthe proposal, viz:- to economise ships in such a manner as toput a large proportion of them into reserve, is not only new,but a complete reversal of the policy hitherto pursued, whichhas
has been to put into uso every ship we have got, and to worryships into use and therefore into danger instead of economisingthem.    this matter is so important that I venture to give as triking concrete illustration of the value of having ships inreserve.    Fortunately or unfortunately, we have had locked upin the Baltic 62 good ships which we could not get at.    Whatwould have happened if we could have got at them before?This, that they would have been fully employed, and that bythis time the 62 ships would probably have been reduced byattack to a much lower figure.    It is true that we shouldhave had more imports, but should we have been any better offbecause we had those imports?    On the contrary, we should havehad to pay for them, therebjr increasing the difficulties ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and so much more would havebeen consumed in the Country and declared to be absolutelyessential - because we had it.    Circumstances denied us theuse of the 62 ships, and they have been actually in reservefor three years.    It would have been fortunate for us if wehad been compelled in some effective way to maintain areserve of a much larger figure, for in that case we shouldnot last year have committed the extravagance of importing2r\ million tons of commodities per month when we reallyneeded a much smaller quantity, and when, if we had been putto it, we should have begun to cultivate the soil of theUnited Kingdom as we in fact neglected to do.    What I amnow proposing is that we should deliberately form a reserveof shipping by availing ourselves of the good fortune wepossess in being allied to a nation the most productive inthe world, access to the markets of which can be given by a twomonths1 round voyage, and from which we can, if we care todo so, import by the use of only 800 ships, 20,000,000 tonsof commodities per annum.L.
