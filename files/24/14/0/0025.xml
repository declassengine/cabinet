Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.C. 3.Mr. Seton Y/atson has received permission from the recipient ofthe following narrative to communicate it to the department forstrictly confidential use.R.A.L.Special Memorandum on$he $aval Meeting at Cronstadt.---0O0---0O0---0O0---I hare heard the account of what happened at Cronstadt from thelips of Captain V., a technical officer of ability and distinction,v/ho v/as engaged upon highly responsible work in the fortress.     Capt-ain V. is a man of quifct manner, silent unless he has something to saythat is worth listening to, devoted to his profession; and he did notutter one angry or resentful word against those of whose excesses hewas the witness.     I have   no doubt of the absolute truth of what   herelated.On the evening of Monday, liarch 12, (Russian style, February 27)Captain V. learnt, he said, by telephone of what was happening at       \Petrograd.     The Commandant of the fortress, Admiral Viren, v/as alsoin possession of the facts, but he made no oublic announcement andtook no steps: he v/as waiting, V. believed, for orders from hissuperiors as to what he should do.   &apos; However on Tuesday, March 13,Cronstadt remained absolutely quiet.     The men v/ent to work as usualand there was no disturbance.     In the afternoon V.&apos;s workmen came tobira and asked leave to go early in order to attend a meeting in thecathedral square; they were entirely respectful and v/ell-behaved, and^be gave them leave at once.     V. v/ent home, had a bath and read while
ne and his v/ife had their evening tea.     \7hile they were having it theservants came and begged him to take precautions against danger.     V.Knew that in Petrograd officers v/ere having their arms taken from them,and answered that there was nothing to be afraid of, but that if any onecame to ask for arms he should at once be given the swords which werein a stand in the hall.     V. and his wife went to bed as usual.     Hextmorning (\7ednesday, March 14) V. was roused early by a telephone callfrom the daughter of an elderly official, who said that her father hadVeen arrested and begged for assistance.    V. said that he would makeinquiries, and no sooner had rung off than he had a telephone call fromthe father himself, saying that he had been arrested but released again,because &amp;e was a civilian. &apos; Almost immediately after this, the servantscame in to say that there was something going on in the street.     V.looked out and saw a guard of armed men, accompanied by a noisy crowd,coming to the house.     The guard came to the door and were admitted, butthe crowd stayed outside and afterwards went away.    V. asked the menwhat they wanted.     They said * Captain V.&apos;.     He answered *I am CaptainV*.f.     On this they put revolvers to his head with their left hands andheld out their right hands, insisting that he should shake hands andAddress them as ^Comrades&apos;.     This he did.     They then asked for armsand took V^s swords and a Browning that was lying in the drawer of hisdesk.    ]Jext they demanded drink, and he had half a bottle of brandybrought.     They were already rather drunk and made a disgusting mess,spitting on the carpet and chairs and trampling filth everywhere.     &quot;Youdrink too,&quot; they said (using the familiar Hu1), &quot;or perhaps you111poison us.&quot;    v. drank with them.     &quot;While they were sitting at table,they suddenly saw through the open door their reflections in a long pierglass in the bedroom and rushed into the room shouting &apos;there are a lotof chaps hidden there.11 only to find they had made fools of themselves.The party then prepared to set out.     V. asked where they v/ere going.The men said, to a guardroom where all the officers arrested v/ere beingtaken, and in the evening it would be decided who should be set free and Who should be killed.     V. said good-bye to his wife who had behaved allthis
this time with complete coolness as if the men v/ere ordinary visitors,adding that he would probably be back in the evening.     They had a longfay to v/alk, and the men soon got tired; tr/ice they stopped v/hile theydebated whether they should finish off V. at once, but the senior amongthem, who was also the most drunken, insisted that their orders were totake him alive to the guardroom and this view finally prevailed.     Onthe v/ay they passed the Havy Club and V. saw a large number of corpseslying in the street outside it.     He could see that most v/ere those ofsenior officers and it is this fact that makes him and his fellovrofficers think that the murdered iseii were killed in accordance -..ith alist drawn up beforehand by German agents.     This suggestion is alsosupported by the fact that in the case of all the arrests made, soldiersv/ere sent for naval officers and sailors were sent for military officers;thus there v/ould be no favouritism.     Before 10 o&apos;clock V- reached theguardroom and found over a hundred other officers already collected there.After a while an angry crowd gathered round and v/anted to break in andmurder all the officers; finding they could not do this they made pre-parations to set the building on fire.     On this a force of sailors cameand marched the officers, jeered by the croY/d, to the convict prison ofwhich the Y/alls and gates were too strong to be assaulted.     The convictshad all been liberated in the morning and no doubt mingled with theferocious mob.     At the prison the officers were divided into groups andshut up in various cells.     At intervals the door of the cell in Y/hichCaptain V. and those with him Y/ere confined v/as opened and the sailor onguard called &quot;Pxear-Admiral So-and-so,!, &quot;Lieutenant 33.&quot;, &quot;Colonel M. &quot;.Those called went out and were immediately shot in the street outside.Among the number was an officer who had been brutally ill-treated, havinghad spikes driven into his back and a heavy bag of flour strapped on tothemand in this condition had been driven through the streets.     He ivasln a fainting condition but xs picked up like a bundle and taken out tooe shot.     One officer, an Admiral, received a message that his own menhad
had come to safeguard him through the streets, hut that there were onl&amp;three of them and it v/ould he wiser to send for him at night when thestreets would he quieter.     The Admiral sent to ask the men to come hackMter.     On this they became angry, said that he did not trust them andordered that he should be sent out to them    He went out and was at oncekilled.    Another, when called, drew a revolver from his pocket andcommitted suicide.     This created a great hubbub, as all the officers hadbeen searched on being arrested,and they were   all again searched stillmore thoroughly for concealed weapons.     In the evening, when dark hadalready fallen, Captain y, was called.     He went out, expecting instantdeath, but found half a dozen of his own men who took him safely to the&quot;quarters of his service.     Here he,in company with other officers hefound there, was treated with every consideration, given dinner - for hehad had nothing to eat or drink all day -   and was elected commandingofficer by his men.     He v/as given a certificate to the effe&amp;t that hehad the right to move about freely, stamped with a rubber stamp of theTemporary Committee of Movement&quot; bearing the word &quot;Ireedomf? and thetoy Plag.     It seemed unlikely that this stamp had been made during thisvery busy day: if the inference that it had been made Ttefoane. w&amp;s sound,wasthis/further evidence of preconcerted action   by some outside agency.JCaptain V. asked the men to join the officers at their meal; they con-sent ed, but shyly and made no attempt at undue familiarity, and whan theofficers turned in for the night, sleeping on mattresses on the floor,offered even to take off his boots.     This V. refused, saying that hoalways took off his own boots.     The kind treatment and V.&apos;s being alivehimself he attributed solely to the good relations that he had alwayscultivated with the men of the service.rhe next day, March 15, began badly.     A strong guard of men of adifferent service arrived early and wished to arrest Captain V.     They ha.dalready been to his house and had made his wife sit mbttbonless for tuenty^mtes with a revolver pressed to either temple.     Captain V. shelved hiscertificate
certificate, which seemed to surprise the men Very much, and they went of,io the Committee of Movement saying that a mistake had been made.    prese;ly a message came from the Committee that V.*s election by his men was in?admissible and that he was deposed.    V. now felt sure that he was going 1be killed: he spent the day in \7riting farewell letters, and distributedhis medals and personal belongings among his comrades.    By evening how-evemaothing had happened.    When one of the men came to him at nightagain with an offer to take off his boots, V- asked if he knew what theobjection to himself was.     The man answered that he knew, and after somepressing told Y. that a denunciation had been made against him on threecounts.    The first was that V. had always been severe in dealing withcases of desertion.    This V.,in telling the story, admitted to be thecase: he looked upon desertion as a disgraceful crime that ought to be$unished with all the strictures of the law.     $he second count was thatV. had always refused to allow men to remain under his protection whenthey ought to join the Colours.     This also was true and V. had had con-stant difficulties owing to his superior officer1 s habit of verballyacceding to petitions of this kind and sending the petitioners on to V.,who had in duty to refuse them.     The third was that nevertheless V. hadmade some exceptions and had allowed men to remain when they should havebeen elsewhere.     Eere the fact was that on three occasions V. had beendefinitely ordered in writing by his superior to authorise the employmentof man who should have gone to the army, and he had been compelled underprotest to carry out his instructions.     On these two last points, the mansaid, v. had the women very keenly against him.Once again V&apos;1s good relations with his men stood him in good stead.The next day they refused to give him up, and sent him back to his housegiving him moreover a guard to see that he was not interfered with.     Sohe remained for some days until a pass was brought to him signed by the ne\Commandant of the town, a naval petty officer and a known drunkard.     This^apowered him to accompany his family to Petrograd, and setting out in theevening
ening with his wife, - he crept along the by-streets to the:,quay.     &quot;Halt.1o are you?&quot;     Captain V. produced his pass.     The sentinel took it andloriously conned it.     &quot;humph - seems all right.&quot;    The man handed it tos mate.     &quot;Aye, seems all right.     Get along with you.&quot;^oince coming to Petrograd Captain V. has been in receipt of authentict78 from Cronstadt.     An admiral has been appointed Commandant of the1rtress but has a coucil of able seamen without whom he can do nothing,e soldiers would like to join completely with the new government, butI sailors refuse to recognise fully even the authority of the Council\7orkmenf8 and Soldiers * Deputies.     Outward order is preserved but fori rest in the course of a month, the situation remains unchanged.     An-icer, for instance, who had been elected to his post by his men, wasested on a denunciation of three workmen whom, having finished the workwhich they were employed, he ordered to join the forces and was kepti ,prison for ten days.     Another officer, who v/as given some days leaveIm Cronstadt, supplemented Captain V.fss narrative v/ith the informationt the large number of officers imprisoned there are forced to do thet menial and degrading work.     They have to wash up the men!s slops, toan out the latrines, black the petty officers1 boots, and must addressmen in the polite plural, the equivalent of ,vou8l, while the men call&amp; &apos;tu&apos; and bully and rail at them.     Two admirals were made to hewp uithin sight of the steamer quay, and they were compelled to wear theirplder straps, shewing their rank, which is permitted to no other officersthe streets of Cronstadt.     Captain V. estimated the number of officerstiered at over a hundred; the other officer quoted said he believed onepea. and three.     He wanted not to return , but was obliged to, as iftUd not it might furnish an excuse for his comrades to be ill-treatedmurdered.    He said that when Kerensky; the Minister of &quot;Justice, wentCronstadt he was not allowed to f/C told anything of what v/as going on,when the government sent to bring the imprisoned officers to Petrograd^^emissary was refused with armed threats.     These two officers onlyspoke
Bpoke of what they had themselves seen, hut many other excesses arefredibly reported, and it is said that after he was hanged, firstlaving been flogged, Admiral Viren^ head was cut off and used &quot;by thefiailors as a football.6
