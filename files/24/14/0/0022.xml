SECRET.8515Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Indiaon Indian Reforms.I have to invite the attention of the Cabinet to the very serious problemswith which we are now confronted in India and to request a decision as tothe action to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is not too much tosay that upon a right decision at this critical time depends the peace andcontentment of India for years and perhaps generations to come.Already before he left India Lord Hardinge had drawn up a Memorandumon post-bellum reforms and had obtained the opinions of the principal officersof Government upon them.Lord Ohelmsford, on &apos; assuming office, at once set to work with hisCouncil in the same field, and in a despatch dated 2ith November 1916 hehas submitted the results of their deliberations.With some of the subjects raised, such as the position of India and Indiansin the Empire, we have already dealt. With others, such as those whichconcern the Army, the greater-employment of Indians in the public servicesand the reform of the minor organs of Local Government, I am alreadydealing or am prepared to deal without troubling the Cabinet at any rateat this stage-though I shall have to bring the question of Commissions forIndians before the Cabinet as soon as I am in full possession of the proposalsof the Government of India. On hone of these points do I anticipate anyserious difference of opinion between the-&apos; Government of India andmyself.There remain the proposals which deal with the political institutions ofIndia, with &quot;the composition of the Legislative Councils, the numbers of theelected element in these Councils, the methods of election, the constituenciesand the franchise, and lastly with their powers and their relations to theExecutive Councils.    ,, -   .  &apos;In approaching these subjects the Government of India propose anelaborate formula denning the &quot;goal &quot; of British Government in India, andthey then describe the means by which they propose to advance towards thisgoal.   (Appendix D of attached Memorandum.)My criticism of these proposals is twofold. I have been reluctantlybrought to the conclusion that some general statement of our policy isnecessarj?-. But I think that the statement of a &quot;goal&quot; suggested by theGovernment of India is far too formal and elaborate, and is unlikely to meetwith hearty acceptance in any quarter. If the object of British Governmentin India is to be stated in this way it does not appear to me that we canavow any purpose except the gradual development of free institutions with aview to self-government. The less formal this statement is made the better,and it should be accompanied by a clear indication that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must be the judge of the time and measure of each advance.&apos;My second criticism is that the methods proposed by the Government ofIndia are not adapted to their purpose in so far as they concern what 1 havecalled the political institutions of the country. The Government of Indiapropose to pave the way for the ultimate enlargement of the constitutionalpowers of the Provincial Legislative Councils by an increase in the elected* element and an extension of the constituencies. It appears to me that thisis putting the cart before the horse. The Morley-Minto reforms provided fora considerable elected element in each Council, but they gave to the Councilsno real control in any department of Government. The result is that theelected members are in the main-a body of irresponsible critics who, nodoubt, exercise considerable influence on Government, cause questions tobe considered which would otherwise slumber and do indirectly affect the&quot;policy of Government, both in matters of omission and commission. Butthey have no direct authority, no responsibility of any kind, and, as mightbe expected under the circumstances, their criticism and their proposals areoften quite unreasonable and anything but helpful.OT 500 [It
If was common ground in the early stages of the war that some advancewould have to be made after the war. All that has since happened theconstant harping on the theme that we are fighting for liberty and justice andthe rights of people to direct their own destinies, the revolution in Russiaand the way in which it has been received in this country and elsewhere, thereception of the Indian delegates here, and the position given to India in thecouncils of the Empire-has strengthened the demand for reform and hascreated a ferment of ideas by which the Government of India are evidentlysomewhat alarmed. It is certainly the case that if we reject the idea ofreform or if our proposals fail to strike the imagination of Indian politicians,we shall throw the moderate element-such as it is-into the hands of theextremists and may well be confronted in India with a second Ireland. I amprepared, therefore, for advance and I think that we must act boldly. Butthe mere multiplication of critics without any attempt to give them eitherauthority or responsibility, in however a restricted field, seems to me notmerely not to mark any real advance towards self-government, or. even anyreal development of free institutions, but to be fraught in itself with gravedanger. I do not believe that it would satisfy anyone or that it is in itselfa sound policy.It is under these circumstances that I propose that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should appoint a small Committee or Commission to examine theproposals of the Government of India and to take evidence upon them. Iwould suggest that the starting point of their enquiry should be a recognitionthat the time has come for a further advance, that they should be directedto enquire into the working of the Councils under the Morley-Mintoconstitution, a?id to advise what changes should be made in their composition,methods of election and powers:It will be observed that the Government of India propose no alterationin the Imperial Legislative Council. Such changes as they recommend areconfined to the Provincial Government. I think that the enquiry of theCommittee should extend to the Imperial Legislative Council and to therelations of the Legislative Councils to the Executive.I attach a copy of a Memorandum which examines more fully theproposals of the Government&apos;of India. The Despatch itself as well as thereport of a strong Committee which I appointed to consider it will be sentto any member of the Cabinet who desires a copy. I would&apos; ask theCabinet to appoint a meeting specially for their discussion. It would, Ithink, be an advantage to the Cabinet if I were accompanied on thatoccasion by Sir Thomas Holderness and Lord Islington, Under Secretariesof State, and by Sir William Duke, who presided over the India OfficeCommittee. It will be seen that the Government of India are pressing forpermission to make an immediate announcement1, and that they are opposedto the appointment of a Commission2. On the other hand such an independentenquiry by such a body is demanded by unofficial Indians, is recommendedby the India Office Committee, and receives much support in this country.I attach a copy of my reply tO&quot; the Government of India3 and of a privatetelegram I have sent to the&apos; Viceroy.4I shall be glad if the Cabinet would take the matter into considerationat the earliest possible moment.A.

APPENDIX.(() Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated IStli May 1917.The present situation renders it extremely desirable that Governmentshould make some public declaration in regard to constitutional andadministrative changes proposed after the war and also as to its attitudetowards agitation inaugurated -by Home Rule League.The Russian Revolution, publication of statements as to right of thepeoples to govern themselves, the reception accorded to representatives ofIndia at the recent War Conference by the. authorities in the UnitedKingdom and by the representatives of the Dominions, the feeling thatIndia has done so much to assist the Empire during the war and the general-democratic influences of the avar have in the last feav months affectedpolitical feeling in India materially.The agitation for immediate Home Rule is being fomented with greatAdgour by Mrs. Besant, Tilak and others, and in absence of any definiteannouncement of Government as to its policy in the matter, is attractingmany of those who hitherto have held less advanced vieavs. The recentdecision of the Bombay High Court in the case under Section 108 of theCode of Criminal Procedure against Tilak has encouraged this party tofurther efforts, and though signs are not avanting that the movement isregarded with mistrust by many, the agitation is having a mischievous effecton public feeling throughout the country. The clanger is aggravated byconsistent and malicious attacks on system and methods of: present adminis-tratibn. Many of the advocates of immediate Home Rule must know suchabrupt revolutionary changes in the whole administrative machinery are-impossible, but this is not realised hy the public to whom they appeal, andwe fear that the result Avill be a feeling of bitter disappointment andpossibly of dangerous unrest Avhen it is found that Government fail to meetdemands made.On the other hand there is an influential though timid unorganised and-comparatively inarticulate body of opinion which is opposed to and afraid ofany sudden and violent changes in the constitution and looks to Governmentfor support against the extremist propaganda. There are also many AvaverersAArho are looking to us for guidance. The omission of GoArernment to makeits attitude clear on this subject is misunderstood by the general public andleaves a free field to extremists. The absence indeed of any pronouncementhas been the cause of some embarrassment to Local Governments.We realise difficulty of making any declaration of our policy at presentas ave are not in a position to state specifically avhat our proposals are and asany&apos; statement which ave make will be open to criticism that it is too Vagueto be of practical use in combating the attractive and plausible programmeof the extremists. Nevertheless for the reasons stated above and in order toarrest the further defection of moderate opinion we think it desirable to, make the position of the Government- clear as far as this is possible. Wepropose with your approA^al therefore to publish following statement:  &quot;The Government of India; in-view of misapprehension AArhiclr exists as.to their intentions regarding constitutional and administrative changes afterthe avar, consider it desirable to make a general statement in regard-to theirpolicy in this matter. The Government have, as is generally known,addressed the Secretary of State&apos; on the subject of these changes&apos;, withparticular reference to future development of self-government in India; andhave, expressed themselves in the following terms: (Here quote extractfrom paragraph 35 of Despatch No. 17, datsd 24th November 1916, beginningavith the words &apos; the&apos; goal to which,&apos; and ending with the words &apos; politicaland administrative entities-1.&quot;It is apparent from this that Government recognised self-governmentwithin, the Empire as a legitimate and praise-avorthy aspiration deserving allencouragement.1 See Appendix D of annexed Memorandum.
&quot; In the same despatch the Government of India expressed their anxiousdesire to see a real and immediate advance made towards this goal, andhave laid down the general lines on wrhich in their opinion such advancecould properly be made.   These include :-&quot;(1) The development of urban and rural-self-government in directioncf giving greater powers to Local Boards-and Councils, andmaking these bodies predominatingly non-official and elective incharacter.&quot; (2) An increase in the-number of Indians employed in higher branchesof the service in order to enable Indians to take a more prominentpart in the administration of the country; aud steps towardsultimate enlargement of the constitutional powers of the LegislativeCouncils in certain directions.&quot; The policy of the Government of India in this matter is therefore clearand proposals which they have put forward have been conceived in noilliberal spirit and are designed to secure as much real and immediateprogress as is compatible with the present stage of devolopment of thecountry, the,protection of the legitimate rights and interests of all classes ofHis Majesty&apos;s subjects and the position of India as an integral part of theBritish Empire.&quot; The specific proposals made in order to give practical effect to thepolicy enunciated above are at present under the consideration of theSecretary of State.. It is hoped that within a short time it may be possibleto give further information, but it would be premature to make any furtherstatement at present.&quot;From what has been stated above it is clear it is not the intention ofGovernment to embark on any sweeping and abrupt changes in the wholeconstitutional and administrative machinery of India. This machinery hasbeen gradually evolved in light of many years&apos; experience to meet verydiverse and often conflicting interests, and could not safely be transferredotherwise than very gradually to control of new and inexperiencedauthorities. &apos;&quot; Indeed if the very serious responsibility of the Government in thematter both to the peoples of India and to the British Empire be considered,it will be patent to all those who have made any study of the subject thatthe Government could not consistently with its duty to the Crown be aconsenting party to revolutionary changes or rash experiments. TheGovernment of India are, however, aware that changes of this character havebeen advocated by various political associations in India, some of which haveindeed gone so far as to press for such an immediate enlargement of thepowers of the Legislative Councils as would.be tantamount to transferringto those bodies control of the whole of the internal administration of India.&quot; The Government of India do not think it necessary to discuss in detailthe dangers of such a course. They are content to say that in their opinionsuch a policy could only have disastrous results, and must prejudice theultimate realisation of the goal which the Government and all really patrioticIndians have in view. They believe that these dangers are fully appreciatedby those who have vested interests in the country or have made an intelligentstudy of the complicated administrative machinery of Government. Indeedthey, find it difficult to believe that any -such wholesale and immediatetransfer can honestly commend itself to anyone who is capable of states-manlike appreciation- of what is practically possible under presentconditions.&quot; At the same time the Government of India are most anxious to avoid,any action which might even suggest that they seek to stifle fair criticism orlegitimate movements for political advancement of this country particularlyat a time when India has rendered and is rendering great service to theEmpire. They recognise also that there are and must be honest differencesof opinion as to the rate of progress towards the goal.of self-government, andthey, seek to enlist the co-operation of all sections of the Community inaccelerating progress on.sound lines towards that ideal.&quot; They cannot, however, but view with grave concern the attitude*of thosepeople who either in ignorance of the difficulties which the problem presents
or from a desire to embarrass Government, place before an ill-informed-;public a political programme impossible of early attainment, the refusal; ofwhich must lead to disappointment and consequent unrest. The action ofsuch agitators is the more blameworthy when, as is sometimes the case, theysupport their&apos;views by mis-statements of fact, by misrepresenting theintentions of Government and by unfair attacks upon .the administration.In normal times it might not be necessary to take public notice of suchattacks, but the position is different when the Empire is engaged in a,vitalstruggle, and when it is essential that its united strength should beconcentrated on one object, the successful prosecution of the war.&quot;Hitherto the Government of India have abstained from&quot; any public,statement in regard to this movement in the hope that the impracticablenature of the programme (? upheld) would in itself be enough to preventit from acquiring any power for mischief; but in view of the spread ofthese ideals and of the undesirable methods employed in promoting them,they feel that they should no longer refrain from making public theirattitude in regard to it, and they hope by this statement of their ownpolicv, and of the dangers consequent on unscrupulous agitation forrevolutionary changes, to secure the active support in discouraging suchmovements from all who have the welfare of their countiy at heart, andwho realise not only the impossible character of the demands now beingmade, but also the injury which unscrupulous agitation for revolutionarychanges must inflict upon the cause of orderly and . progressivedevelopment.&quot;Sir C S. Nair wishes it to be stated that he does not accept that part ofthe statement beginning with the words &quot; the policy of the Government,&quot;and ending with the words &quot;an integral part of the British Empire,&quot; andany other statements which are inconsistent with his minute of dissent whichaccompanied Despatch No. 17, of 24th November.(2) Private telegram from Viceroy to the Secretary of State, datedISth May 1917,Private. I am sending you an official telegram to-day with reference topolitical position. My Council earnestly deprecates idea of a Commission,especially if, as has been suggested, it is to come out here and take evidence.The experience of the Public Services Commission does not encourage us tolook with hopes of good results from a Commission which has to advise onpolicy. The issue at stake at the present moment is not a question of fact,but of policy pure and simple, which we respectfully submit is a matter forGovernment to decide.. In default, therefore, of your being able to come outpersonally and investigate the position which might stay agitation we feelbound to press upon you our policy as laid down in our Reforms despatch.We have given this matter of an announcement very careful considerationand it has been pressed upon us by the Government of Bombay who areparticularly affected by the Home Rule agitation. We have hesitated,therefore, to press you for a decision at a time of such grave preoccupation,but we feel now that it is our duty to do so. I may say that while westrongly deprecate a Commission, we should be&apos;willing to take consultationwith outside non-official opinion in India on the proposals of our despatch ifyou wish it. But we should much prefer this being deferred until, we had.an expression of your views on the proposals of our despatch.(3) Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Home Department,dated 22nd May 1917.- Your telegram of 18th May. Constitutional Reforms. I appreciate thereasons which lead you to wish to make a statement of your policy, but Ithink it must be deferred until the Government here have considered theissues of high policy raised by your proposed definition of the objective ofOT 500 B
British rule in India, and have come.to a decision as to the immediate actionto be taken in the way of a political advance.*To publish, as you propose, the text of your definition before theGovernment here have accepted it, would be most embarrassing. It wouldbe taken either as committing the Home Government, or as forcing theirhands, or as revealing a conflict of views between the two Governments. Ishould be pressed to publish at once the despatch and accompanying dissents,and the whole programme of reforms would be the subject of publiccontroversy before it had been settled by the responsible Governments. Tobe effective and conclusive, a pronouncement by your Government on somomentous a subject as self-government for India and the lines of advancetowards it should represent the considered views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand be made in language expressly authorised by them.I hope to obtain decisions of the Government shortly on the recommenda-tions of your despatch, and must ask you to defer until then any declaration .of policy.Without prejudging their decision my conclusions at present are asfollows : (1) First three paragraphs of your definition of goal seem too elaborateand formal. All mv information shows that it would not givesatisfaction, and its very elaboration lends itself to criticism. Asimpler declaration of policy will probably be preferred.(2) As to.lines of advance numbered (a), (b), (c), in definition, I am ingeneral accord with (a), but would ask you to work out system ofexternal control over local bodies such as is provided here byHome Office and Local Government Board, and to providepermanent service of local officials before withdrawing internalcontrol and expert advice afforded by present official chairmen.Despatch on this subject will follow.(3) To (6) I agree.(4) I agree with your object in (c), but doubt whether your proposalswill promote it. Unless associated with increased power andresponsibility, increase of elected element is not an advancetowards, or training in, self-government, and would be an&apos; obstacle if it resulted only in irresponsible criticism ofadministration and perverse action in legislation. Nor are mereincrease of elected element and enlarged electorates likely tosatisfy demand for. political advance. Further objection is thatconstitution &quot;and powers of Imperial Legislative Council areuntouched. Your proposals seem to me not to reach kernel ofproblem which is devolution of power and reponsibility within&apos; such limited sphere as may at present be practicable andreasonably safe.(5) For these reasons I think further study of the problem desirable.My idea is to announce that Government being desirous&quot; ofdeveloping free institutions within the Empire, and consideringthat time had come for further advance in India have decided toappoint. small Committee or Commission to examine working ofMorley-Minto reforms and to advise what changes in the compo-sition, constitution, and powers of the Legislative Councils aredesirable, and what should be their relations to ExecutiveCouncils.I will let you know as soon as possible the decision of the Government.On it will depend the form of the warning which you wish to give tothe public.   I. agree that some such statement is desirable.(^-Private telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 22nd May 1917.Private. Declaration of policy. I am submitting papers to Cabinet andasking for early meeting for discussion and decision. My views are expressedat greater length in my private letters dated 2nd and especially J 5th May.I have regretfully come to conclusion that personal visit .of Secretary of State
to India would create an impossible situation, and I therefore adhere to ideaof small Committee or Commission which is asked for by Indians, recom-niended by my Council and pressed on me by Members of Parliament andothers here.Such Committee or Commission would bear no resemblance to PublicServices Commission. It would be small impartial body to advise HisMajesty&apos;s Government. I hope it would sit for the most part in private. Itwould be much easier to constitute if it sat here as suggested by you, andthis is urged on me by Sinha, Wedderburn, &amp;c, who obviously fear that ifit goes to India it will come too much under official influence.On the other hand, unless it goes to India it could not consultGovernors and Lieutenant-Governors, nor do I see how moderate andespecially conservative elements could be represented before it.Only witnesses would be such as you could send or I supply here anddelegates of 19 members, Congress, and Moslem League and the like.It might be possible to arrange that sittings should open here and thatCommission or some of its members should visit India later.
Confidential.Memorandum on Indian Reforms.In an important despatch, the Government of India have submitted forapproval a series of proposals having as their object the recognition of theservices rendered to the Empire by India in the war, and of the loyal andsteadfast attitude of the people. Some of these proposals are for the removalof specific grievances, such as the restrictions at present existing upon thepossession and use of arms; others. relate to the grant of rewards inrecognition of military services. Others again are concerned with admini-strative reforms, such as the. larger employment of Indians in the higherranks of the public services, and the development of urban and rural LocalGovernment. Lastly, proposals are made for reconstituting the LegislativeCouncils, and for giving a formal assurance to the peoples of India that theultimate aim of British rule in India is to fit them for and to endow themwith self-government.This memorandum is concerned only with the last&apos; group of proposals.They alone raise issues of the first magnitude, issues which affect the formand direction of the future political development of India and the positionof that continent in the Empire.The Legislative Councils. The Government of India thus describe theoriginal character of these Councils and the changes made by theParliamentary Statutes of 1892 and 1909 :-&quot; In their origin these Councils were first called into existence to form, bodies of advisers to the various Governments, Imperial andProvincial, when legislative work&apos;was in hand. These advisers werefew, and were at first selected entirely by nomination. The reformsinstituted by Lord Lansdowne in 1892 introduced for the first timean elective element into these. Councils, and gave them the privilegeof interpellation, as well as a right to discuss the annual Budget, butwithout the power to amend it. Seventeen years later the Morley-Minto reforms completely revised the constitution of these Councils,by expanding them numerically and by increasing the number oftheir elected members, as well as by enlarging considerably theconstituencies which these latter represented ; they added to the rightof interpellation by permitting resort to supplementary questions;they gave the right to move resolutions both in connection with theprovincial budgets, and on other topics of public interest; and last,but not least, they provided for a* majority of non-officials in theprovincial Legislative Councils.&quot;Up to 1909 the number of &quot; additional&quot; members in the Governor-GeneraPs Council was limited to 16 as a maximum. (They are called&quot; additional &quot; members because they are added to the Executive Councilwhen the latter resolves itself into a legislative body.) In the severalprovincial Legislative Councils the limit varied from 15 to 20. The Act of1909 doubled or more than doubled these numbers. The limit is now 60for the Imperial Legislative Council, 50 for the Legislative Councils in thelarger Provinces, and 30 in the smaller Provinces.% In the small Legislative Councils existing up to 1909, half the memberswould often be officials. The non-official members were all nominated,though in certain cases where a member was nominated as representing aUniversity or other corporate body, there was a semblance of election. Thefunctions of these Councils were confined strictly to legislation, thoughthere was a limited power of asking questions and of discussing, though notdividing on, the annual Budget estimates.The Act of 1909, by requiring the Governor-General in Council to makeregulations as&quot;to the conditions under which and the manner in. whichpersons should be &quot; nominated or elected &quot; as members of the Legislative^Councils, in effect recognised and approved the elective principle.   In eachOT 494 . a
Council a large proportion, though not the majority, of the members iselected by constituencies ; and in all the Provincial Councils the elected andthe nominated non-official members together exceed the number of official-members. But as tbe Local Government can ordinarily count on the supportof some of the nominated non-official members, its majority is pretty secure.In the Imperial Council there is a majority of official, members.Themode of constituting the electorates varies greatly in the differentProvinces, but broadly speaking the object aimed at is to obtain, so far as ispossible, a fair representation of the different- classes and interests. In theBengal Council, for example, of the 28 elected members C represent specialcorporate bodies (such as the Calcutta University, Chambers of Com-rnerce, &amp;c), 5 represent constituencies formed of the landowners of theProvince, 7 and 5 represent respectively the municipalities and the districtboards of the Province, and 5 the Muhammedan community. The consti-tuencies are not territorial units but groups of persons invested with thefranchise. The franchise is very restricted. In a group of municipalitiesit is confined to members of the municipal boards, or in some Provinces todelegates of these members : in a landowner^ group to the large landowners.The average number of voters in a municipal group is 183, and 124. only ina landowner&apos;s group.The Act of 1909 has undoubtedly quickened interest in public affairsamong the population, and the Councils are the centre of this politicalactivity. The right of discussion of the Budget and of matters of generalpublic importance, and the right of moving resolutions and dividing theCouncil upon them, which the members now enjoy, are freely exercised. Intheir origin the Councils were merely legislative bodies. They are nowpolitical institutions. The elected members in each Council tend to form anopposition distrustful and critical of the executive Government. Theycomplain that, being in a minority to the official and nominated members,they cannot carry the legislation they propose or the resolutions which theymove. They ;also complain of the ineffectiveness of the Councils, since theirresolutions are not binding on the government.Discontent with the limited powers of the Councils has grown with time.Advanced political opinion in India, say the Government of India in statingthe case for reform, hotly urges a large advance in the direction of givinglarger powers to the Councils, on the plea that they arc representativeassemblies which voice the popular will and should exercise not merelyinfluence upon, but real authority over, the &quot;will of the executive Govern-ment. But for the special circumstances arising out of the war, theGovernment of India admit that a strong case would not exist for anyimmediate radical changes in the system introduced only seven years ago bythe Morley-Minto reforms. But they urge tliat, &quot;having&quot; regard to the&quot; situation developed by India&apos;s attitude during the war, and also to the fact&quot; that we now propose to lay down both an ultimate goal and the various&quot; roads which lead to it, we feel that it would be most inexpedient to adopt&quot; a rigid attitude in relation to the demands pressed upon us, and to refuse&quot; to assent to any further progress in this domain of advance.&quot;What the demands are to which the Government of India here refer maybe gathered from a Memorand urn submitted to the Viceroy a few months agoby 19 elected members of the Imperial Legislative Council. &quot; The non-official majorities in the Provincial Councils,&quot; it is there urged, &quot; have&quot; proved largely illusory and give no real power to the representatives of the&quot; people, The Legislative Councils, whether Supreme or Provincial, are&quot; practically as little associated with the real government of the country as&quot; they were before the reforms, except for the introduction of the Indian&quot;element in the Executive Councils, where again the nomination rests&quot; entirely with the Government, the people having no voice in the selection&quot;of the Indian members.&quot; Reforms, it is said, are required that will go tothe root of the matter. &quot;They must give to the people real and effectiveparticipation in the government of the country.&quot; The Memorandumconcludes with a number of recommendations which, so far as they concernthe Legislative and Executive Councils, are set out in Appendix A. Theirgeneral effect would be to double, or more than double, the size - of theCouncils, to place the elected members in each Council in a substantial
majority, to empower the Imperial Legislative Council and each ProvincialLegislative Council to elect.the Indian members of the Imperial and theProvincial Executive Council as the case may be, and to give theLegislative Councils control over the annual Budget and over the executiveadministration.Radical as this scheme is it is out-distanced by one on somewhat similarlines which has since been put before the British, public by the JointCommittee of the National Congress and the All India Moslem League in a*&apos; Home Rule for India &quot; leaflet. Under this scheme the Imperial LegislativeCouncil would be empowered to pass resolutions and laws which would bebinding on the Government of India, the Viceroy having only a suspensorypower for a limited period as regards a resolution, and the right of veto, asregards a law, being reserved to the Crown alone. The Provinces wouldbe virtually autonomous units, having each a Legislative Council which wouldexercise, as regards the head of the Government, the same powers that theImperial Legislative Council would exercise over the Governor-General inCouncil. This scheme is meant to give &quot; home rule&quot; to India. It ismentioned here merely as showing that the art of constitution making isbeing widely practised in India, and that the excitement and unrest generatedby the war in the mass of the Indian population have communicated them-selves to politics. The degree of progress which the Government of Indiadeem advisable is in itself small compared with the schemes pressed uponthem. But the Government proposals, while they would in all probabilitybe regarded as wholly inadequate by Indian advocates of reform, imply, andwould quicken a demand for, more radical changes in the immediate future.In this lies their imrjortance.The text of the Government of India&apos;s scheme is given in Appendix B.Briefly, it contemplates an elected majority in each of the Provincial Councils,a wide extension of the franchise, a system of electorates based primarily on ^territorial units in place of the present one of classes and interests, and anenlargement, more or less considerable, of the numbers of the existingCouncils. Recognising that some Provinces.are less politically advanced thanothers, the Government of India propose to give considerable discretion toeach Local Government as to adopting the scheme in its entirety ormodifying it. But it may he doubted whether in1 practice a Local Govern-inent, in face of the political pressure to which it would be exposed, wouldbe able for long to refuse to keep step with the most advanced Province.The discretion might, therefore, prove less of a safeguard than is expected.The Government of India do not propose for the present to enlarge theconstitutional powers of the Provincial Legislative Councils, but theysuggest that two or three of the non-official members should be associatedwith the Government in the preparation of the Budget as a whole, and, thatin debating and dividing on Bills and Resolutions the official members shouldbe allowed greater individual liberty.The Government of India again do not propose to alter the constitutionof the Imperial Legislative Council. An official majority would still beretained in this Council and the mode of election of the elected memberswould be unaltered. The reasons which the Government of India give forthis distinction between the Provincial Councils and the Imperial Council -/v\rill be found in Appendix C.It will be seen from the passage from the Despatch quoted in Appendix B,that the proposals sent home for approval do not command the unanimous-assent of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council. Sir Reginald Craddock&apos;s dissentis confined to two points. He is opposed to the expansion numerically ofthe Provincial Legislative Councils beyond their present statutory limits, andhe would maintain electorates based on the principle of class representation.:Sir Sankaran Nairs objections to the scheme are fundamental and his viewsapproximate to those of the Memorandum of the 19 members.The Government of India&apos;s proposals in their final shape have not-undergone the criticism of Local Governments.   But the Viceroy at an early:stage took the heads of Provinces into his confidence.   He privatelyacquainted them with the result of the discussions that had taken place inhis Executive Council on the subject of &quot; the goal&quot; of British policy in$ India and of the roads by which it might be reached.   A definite policy, he
wrote, would be looked for by the Indian people at the end of the war, and adefinite policy required an objective. He asked their opinion on a provisionaldefinition of &quot; the goal&quot; which his Council had drawn up, and on theirprogramme of advance in the three spheres of municipal and rural localgovernment, the more extensive employment of Indians in responsible officejand the Legislative Councils. On the last head he sent to them forconsideration alternative schemes, one restricted to minor changes in themode of election and composition of the existing Councils without increasingtheir numbers or giving the elected members a permanent and substantialmajority or substituting territorial electorates for the present basis of repre-sentation of classes and interests ; the other of a bolder character withwhich the Government of India (Sir R. Craddock excepted) in their presentdespatch have since identified themselves.Of. the three Governors of Presidencies Lord Pentland (Madras), LordWillingdon ^ (Bombay), Lord Carmichael (Bengal) all men of Englishpolitical experience the first doubted the necessity for any change in thepresent constitution of the Councils ; the other two held that the times calledfor a real measure of political progress and preferred the larger schemesubject to certain modifications! They wished to see large constituencies ofa territorial character, a substantial majority of elected members and aconsiderable increase in the total number of members.The Lieutenant-Governors and Chief Commissioners were more reservedin their view of Council reconstruction. Sir James Meston (United Provincesof Agra and Oudh) frankly said that though the Legislative Council in itspresent form had served a good purpose, there was little vitality about it.The certainty that the elected members could nearly always be outvoted hadgenerated a feeling of irresponsibility. &quot; It is used as a forum for badger-&quot; ing unpopular departments, or declaiming manifestos, or reading speeches&quot; which have been written by a paid scribe and bear little or no relation to&quot; the real opinions of the members. : . . . In training the people for&quot; the work of Government it does little or nothing.&quot; He was thereforeprepared to give a &quot; clear majority of members elected by the people uponelectoral rolls of a reasonably democratic character.&quot; But he proposed noenlargement of the total numbers of his Legislative Council, and wasdecidedly of ^opinion that constituencies based on &quot; classes and interests &quot;should not be replaced by territorial units. &quot; With a territorial system of&quot; representation,&quot; he wrote, &quot; the professional or politician class will&quot; continue to appear in our Council, to strengthen its hold, to give voice to&quot; the same ideas and gradually to oust all rivalry on the part of the&quot; more stable and conservative elements.&quot; Apprehensions as to the probableeffect of radical changes in the present composition of the Councils wereexpressed still more strongly by other Lieutenant-Governors (Bihar andOrissa, the Punjab) and by the Chief Commissioners. The changes whichthey were prepared to recommend were of a strictly limited nature.On some points most of the high officers consulted are agreed. They areready to extend the franchise, to substitute direct for indirect methodsof election, they are anxious to secure a fair representation of all classesand interests of the community in ,the Councils and they would like,to lessen, if possible, the predominance&apos;of &quot;the lawyer politician. Butwhile Lord Carmichael and Lord Willingdon think with the authorsof the scheme of large territorial electorates that such electorates bydeveloping political interest would decrease the influence of the professionalpolitician, the civilian Lieutenant-Governors and Chief Commissioners areconvinced that they would have the contrary effect. Again, all theauthorities consulted are against any changes that would convert theCouncils into parliaments. Lord Willingdon thinks it of fundamentalimportance that &quot; the constitutional functions of the present Councils as&quot; legislative assemblies to assist and advise the head of the Province should&quot; not be so modified as to introduce, or be capable of being interpreted as&quot; introducing, into India the principle of Parliamentary government by&quot; representative institutions.&quot; Lord Carmichael has expressed himself tothe same effect. It would be madness, he said, to give the Councils full anddirect control over the executive at present or until the mass of the people ofIndia were much better educated than at present.    They both see that
enlarged Councils with elected members in a substantial majority willcontrol legislation, having powers to pass measures which the Governmentdisapproves and to reject measures which the Government has broughtforward. But they would trust the Councils not to use this weapon ofoffence to embarrass or to get the upper hand of the executive, and thinkthat they would be steadied by their increased powers and responsibilities.Sir James Meston is equally emphatic that the reformed Councils shouldhave no power to vote upon the Budget or to pass resolutions bearing on theGovernment. But he is more afraid than Lord Willingclon or LordCarmichael that a strong elected majority would use its powers to the full tothe discomfort of the Government. Sir M. 0&apos;Dwyer shares this appre-hension, and for that&quot; reason is against the grant of an elected majority inthe Council of his Province.As may be gathered from these views, no authority consulted is preparedto give to the reconstituted Councils direct power or responsibility in mattersof administration or finance. The statutory powers of the Councils would beconfined, as at present, to legislation, to asking questions and to &quot;moving anddebating resolutions which would not bind the Government.It has been necessary to refer at some length to the replies of heads ofProvinces to the Viceroy&apos;s confidential request for opinion on the alternativeschemes of Council reform, since they furnish the best material for ajudgment as to how the scheme which the Government of India have nowfinally adopted &quot;would, if approved by the Secretary of State in Council, bereceived by the Local Governments whom it would affect. It is clear thatmost of these Governments would avail themselves of the option which thescheme allows to retain the class system of electorates, and that they wouldnot wish to enlarge the present numbers of the Councils, and that some ofthem would show cause for not providing a majority of elected members.In that case, only two Governments Bengal and Bombay would befound ready to take full advantage of the scheme by adopting the system ofterritorial constituencies and largely increasing the size of their LegislativeCouncils. Assuming for the moment that it is decided to approve theGovernment of India&apos;s proposals and to apply to Parliament for the necessaryamendment of the Act of 1909, the situation that would arise&apos; would besomewhat as follows. In India the scheme would be denounced by thenational party as. altogether inadequate, and as falling too utterly belowtheir legitimate expectations, as described in the Memorandum of the19 members, and in the National Congress and Moslem League manifesto,to be accepted even as the first instalment of reform. Those LocalGovernments that were not prepared to go as far as the Governments ofBengal and Bombay would be described as reactionary, and pressure wouldbe used to deprive&apos; them of the option wdiich they would have under theGovernment of India&apos;s scheme to reconstitute their Councils on conservativelines. In Parliament the Secretary of State for India would have to proposelegislation to double or nearly double the maximum limits set to the numberof members of the Provincial Legislative Councils by the Act of 1909, whileexplaining that only two Local Governments at present desired to increasethe size of their Councils, and laying papers which would show that thescheme for reconstructing the Councils and their electorates whichinvolved this, augmentation of numbers was disapproved by other LocalGovernments.A situation of this kind would be strategically weak, however sound thecase for making a political advance in India at the present time may be, andhowever strong may be the merits of the Government of India&apos;s scheme asa mean between counsels of extreme caution and extravagant demands ofthe nationalists. His Majesty&apos;s Government, even if fully satisfied on thesepoints, might well hesitate to give their approval to the Government ofIndia&apos;s proposals without further inquiry. And from the nature of the casethe inquiry would preferably be made by an impartial and independentCommission or Committee, the members of which were familiar with thepractical working of representative institutions and competent to form asound judgment on the preparedness of India for a further political advanceOT 494 . 15
and to weigh the conflicting recommendations of the Indian Governmentsand the demands of advanced reformers.The need for such an inquiry is greatly strengthened if doubts existas to the soundness and sufficiency of the scheme for which sanction issought. That there are such doubts can scarcely be denied. A. schemewhich neither satisfies the Local Governments nor the party of reform andabout which the Government of India themselves are not unanimous must,on this account alone, give rise to doubt. Indian politicians of the pro-gressive class have fixed their desires on an early realisation of home-rulefor India, and demand that as a step towards this elected representatives ofthe Indian people should now be directly associated with the administrationand given a controlling voice in its counsels. As a minimum they ask thatthe elected members shall be in a considerable majority in all the Legis-lative Councils, Imperial and Provincial, and that the vote of the Councilson matters of finance&apos; and of administration shall, subject to a suspensoryveto (and possibly other minor safeguards), be binding upon the Government.The Government of India would give the elected members a clear majorityin the Provincial Councils but would not concede increased authority tothese bodies. &quot;We do not,&quot; say the Government of India, &quot;recommend&quot; any immediate, expansion of powers in the direction which a number of&quot; progressive &apos; politicians desire. &quot;We have no wish to develop the Councils&quot; as quas i-parliaments. Nor are we prepared at present to give them an3^-&quot; thing in the nature of direct financial or administrative control; this may,&quot; we think, come at some later stage of their political evolution, but we have&quot; no doubt that the time for such an advance is not yet. There is much to&quot; be done in the way of political training, and towards the inculcation of a&quot; real sense of administrative responsibility, before any step can be taken in&quot;this direction.&quot; To the &quot; progressive &quot; politician this will seem a blanknegation of his ambitions. And looking at the problem from the Govern-ment standpoint it may be doubted whether the policy which is hereoutlined will generate in the Provincial Councils, enlarged and liberalisedyet denied any right of effective co-operation with or direct control over theexecutive, a sense of administrative responsibility or give their members apolitical training. If the scheme will merely result in representativeassemblies expanded to the size of small parliaments, the elected membersof which are always chafing under a sense of ineffectiveness and in perpetualyet unavailing opposition to the Government, the conditions will be favour-able neither to healthy political development nor to contentment. It wouldalmost seem that the Government of India&apos;s scheme goes too far in somerespects and not far enough in others.It is also doubtful from the Government of India&apos;s attitude towardstheir own proposals whether they have complete confidence in the principleson which they propose to reconstitute the Provincial Councils. They do notpropose to apply them to the Imperial Legislative Council. But if thereconstruction of Provincial Councils is considered necessary in order to givethe members a political training and a greater sense of administrativeresponsibility while withholding from them all direct financial or adminis-trative control, it is difficult to see why the Imperial Council should remainunreformed and a much needed training-and discipline in the domain ofImperial affairs withheld, when they could be given under conditions thatprevent an elected majority from imposing its will on the executive. Again,the wide discretion which the Government of India propose to give to LocalGovernments to determine the character and number of the constituenciesand the size and even the existence of an elected majority suggests a wantof faith or failure of purpose. Most of the Local Governments, if left tothemselves, would not adopt territorial electorates or largely increase thetotal number of members, and would be chary about an elected majority.Unless therefore they should yield to external political pressure and remodeltheir Councils on the plan of the most advanced provinces, the actual advancein political reform would be reduced outside of Bengal and Bombay to exiguousdimensions. The option proposed for Local Governments would not onlyplace them in a difficult and almost unfair position but would make the netoutcome of the scheme uncertain.
On these grounds it is submitted that whether regard be had to thecontents of the scheme itself or to the reception it would meet with fromofficial and parliamentary critics on the one hand and from Indian nationalistson the other, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be well advised tosanction it without further inquiry. It is also submitted that the inquiryshould be made by a Royal Commission or by a small Committee appointedin this country.The inquiry, it is suggested, should proceed on the assumption that asubstantial advance in the direction of liberalising the Legislative Councils,Provincial and Imperial, and in associating them in some measure with theexecutive in financial and administrative affairs, is desirable.The Executive Councils. The enquiry should extend, it is submitted, tothe constitution and functions of the Provincial Executive Councils.Executive Councils exist in the Presidency Governments of Madras, Bombayand Bengal, and in the Lieutenant-Governor&apos;s province of Bihar and Orissa.It is probable that an Executive Council will be established after the war inthe United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and its establishment is likely tobe followed by a demand from the Punjab for an Executive Council in thatprovince. Under the Act of 1909 these Executive Councils consist of suchnumbers of members not exceeding four as may from time to time bedetermined. The present practice is to fix the number at three, of whomtwo are European officials belonging to the Indian Civil tService and thethird is an Indian. Among their reform proposals the Government of Indiarecommend that in future in each provincial Executive Council half themembers shall be Indian. In the Presidential Governments the Governmentof India would raise the number of members to four. In provinces underLieutenant-Governors they would fix the number at four or at two as may befound desirable.The proposal is not one of the first importance in itself, but indirectly itraises the whole question of the functions of these Councils, of their placein the provincial administrative system and of their relation to the Legis-lative Councils. Up to 1909 Provincial Executive Councils existed only inBombay and Madras and consisted of two members. The Act of that yearauthorised an increase in the number of members in the existing Councilsand the creation of Executive Councils in other provinces. The additionsthus made to the higher administrative staff of the provinces have not beenaccompanied by corresponding reductions in existing establishments andre-arrangement of duties. The Councils have been superimposed on an oldstructure without inquiry as to their effect in increasing expenditure,reduplicating work and making the headquarters machinery of Governmentmore complicated and cumbersome than before. The proposed enlargementof some at least of the Executive Councils to the maximum number of fourmembers makes it desirable that there should be an inquiry into possibleconsequential changes in the administrative system of the ProvincialGovernments and into the functions of the Councillors. A furtherquestion as to these Councils is raised in the Memorandum of the 19 membersrecommending that the Legislative Council of a Province should have a voicein the selection of the Indian Members of the Provincial Executive Council.A similar suggestion was made to the A7iceroy by Lord Willingdon. The ideais one that might with advantage be followed up in any investigation of thesystem of Provincial Executive Councils.The Goal:-lt is not proposed to examine critically the definition of theaim and intent of British rule in India which the Government of India havemeticulously framed. Issues of high policy must first be settled before the %formula can be touched. There is a general consensus of opinion among highauthorities in India that some such declaration of policy is required, if onlyto warn the uninstructed Indian public not to be led away by impracticable*4^1s dangled before them by advanced politicians of the Tilak andMrs. Besant type. There is no unanimity as to the terms of the declaration,^nd it- is probable that a much simpler and more explicit formula wouldbetter serve the purpose.India Office,22nd May 1917.
APPENDICES.APPENDIX A.   -Memorandum on Post-War Reforms submitted to the Viceroyby nineteen elected members of the imperial legislative council.(Extract.)$ a ty1. In all the Executive Councils, Provincial and Imperial, half thenumber of members should be Indians ; the European element in theExecutive Councils should, as far as possible, be nominated from the ranksof men trained and educated in the public life of England, so that Indiamay have the benefit of a wider outlook and larger experience of the outsideworld. It is not absolutely essential that the members of the ExecutiveCouncils, Indians or Europeans, should have experience of actual administra-tion, for, as in the case of ministers in England, the assistance of thepermanent officials of the departments is always available to them. Asregards Indians,. we venture to say that a sufficient number of qualifiedIndians, who can, worthily fill the office of members of the Executive Counciland hold portfolios, is always available.The statutory obligation, now existing, that three of the members of theSupreme Executive Council shall be selected from the public services inIndia-, and similar provisions with regard to Provincial Councils should beremoved. The elected representatives of the people should have a voice inthe selection of the Indian members of the Executive Councils, and for thatpurpose a principle of election should be adopted.2. All the Legislative Councils in India should have a substantialmajority of elected representatives.The franchise should be broadened and extended directly to the people,Mahomedans or Hindus, wherever they are in a minority, being given properand adequate representation, having regard to their numerical strength andposition.3. The total number of the members.of the Supreme Council should be-not less than 150, and. of the Provincial Councils not less than 100 for themajor provinces, and not less than 60 to 75 for the minor provinces.4. The Budget should be passed in the shape of money bills, fiscalautonomy being conceded to India.5. The Imperial Legislative Council should have power to legislate onvand discuss and pass resolutions relating to, all matters of Indianadministration,-and the Provincial Councils should have similar powers withregard to Provincial administrations, save and except that the direction ofmilitary affairs, of.foreign relations, declarations of war, the making of peace,and the entering into treaties, other than commercial, should be vested inthe Government of India. As a safeguard, the Governor-General in Councilqr the Governor in Council, as the case may be, should have the rights ofveto which, however, should be exercised subject to certain conditions andlimitations.
APPENDIX B.Scheme for Reconstitution of Provincial LegislativeCouncils.(Extract, paraaraph 48, Secret Despatch No. 17 of24th November48. After careful consideration we have come to the following generalconclusions on these matters : (1) There should be an elected majority, in the councils: .each localgovernment to consider and suggest what the size of this majorityshould be in its owu province. In the event of any particularlocal government considering that an elected majority is undesirablein its province, it would have to demonstrate clearly the reasons forthat opinion.(2) There should be a wide extension of the franchise in the variousprovinces, adapted to their local circumstances, so that themembers of their councils shall be returned by really large con-stituencies.(3) As to the system of electorates, some of us regarcf one based primarilyon territorial units as prima facie more convenient than one ofpurely class constituencies, as tending to give greater play to localinterests and ideas, and larger weight to the landed interestswhich are so enormously preponderant in the India of to-day. We- are not all equally convinced regarding the relative merits ofeither system, upon which the opinions of those whom we haveconfidentially consulted also-differ, but with the exception of ourHonourable Colleagues Sir Reginald Craddock and Sir SankaranNair, we agree that the question is one on which discretion may beleft to each local government to determine for itself whether toadopt territorial constituencies, or to retain class and interestelectorates, or to combine both systems as they may find mostsuitable after full consideration of local circumstances.(4) The adoption of these views would probably require an enlargement in some cases it may be a considerable enlargement of thenumbers of the existing councils, and legislation to this end wouldbe necessary and desirable. -It will thus be seen that we hold that there can be no uniform systemthat must apply to every province regardless of itS&apos;State of progress and itslocal conditions. Such a method would either force the less advancedprovinces into changes for which they are not yet ripe, or conversely, andmore probably, keep back the provinces which are politically more advanced.We are therefore prepared to agree, where necessary, to marked differencesbetween province and province in the composition of the councils, theextent of the elected majority and the constituencies and electoral franchiseupon which these councils are based. Our Honourable Colleague SirReginald Craddock differs from us, however, on two points. While notobjecting to an elected majority, he is entirely opposed to the enlargementof the .present statutory limits of the larger councils, and he is so con-vinced of the necessity of maintaining class representation, that he is notwilling to allow to local governments the option of adopting the territorialsystem. He has explained his reasons in a separate minute. Our HonourableColleague Sir Sankaran Nair on the other hand, would make the territorialsystem universal.   - -OT 4940
APPENDIX C.Treatment of Imperial Legislative Council.(Extract, paragrapJi 54, Secret Despatch No. 17 of;24i/i November 1016.) -S- * $-54. We desire to emphasize the fact.that the proposals which Ave havemade in regard to the provincial legislative councils do not apply to theImperial Council. On the short experience gained since the Morley-Mintoreforms were introduced, we do. not think it advisable to modify the con-stitution of that Council for the present. It will have been seen from whathas gone before that our object is gradually to work up to a state of affairsin which the constitution of the provincial legislative councils will come tojustify am expansion of their powers and functions, and we must wait until-this development has taken place before we can safely contemplate anyserious modification in the constitution of the Imperial Legislative Council.That council is sui generis. It is concerned with the affairs of British Indiaas a whole. It may often have to deal with matters of grave importance,such as the army and the higher finance, as Avell as with the control of thegreat Imperial departments. Its business sometimes touches upon theinterests of the Native States, and ma3r also be concerned with mattersaffecting the relations of India, both with Great Britain and Avith otherparts of the Empire.APPENDIX D.Proposed Definition of the &quot;Goal.&quot;(Extract, paragraph 35, Secret Despatch No. 7 of24th November 1916.)We have consulted many experienced and competent advisers, and Avenow, in the passage which next follows, formulate an ideal Avhich Ave believeAvill give satisfaction to Indian aspirations without embarrassing the presentor future administration of the country :&quot; The goal to which Ave look forward is the endowment of British. India asan. integral part of the Empire, with, self-government, but the rate of progresstowards that goal must depend upon the improvement and Avide diffusion ofeducation, the softening of racial and religious differences, and the accpuisitionof political experience.&quot; The form of self-government to which she may earentually*attain must beregulated by the special circumstances of India. They differ so Avidely fromthose of any other part of the Empire that Ave cannot altogether look for amodel in those forms of self-government which already obtain in the greatDominions. In all parts of the Empire Avhich now enjoy self-government,it has been the result, not of any sudden inspiration of theoretical statesman-ship, but of a steady process of practical evolution, substantially facilitatedby the possession of a more or less common inheritance of political traditions,social customs and religious beliefs.&quot;British India has been built up on different lines, and under differentconditions, and must Avork out by the same steady process of earolution adefinite constitution of her own. In Avhat exact form this may eventually becast it is neither possible nor profitable for us to attempt now to determine,but we contemplate her gradual progress tOAvards a larger and larger measureof control by her own people,-the steady and conscious development ofwhich Avill ultimately result in a form of self-government, differing perhapsin many ways from that enjoyed by other parts of the Empire, but evolved
on lines which have taken into account India&apos;s past history, and the specialcircumstances and traditions of her component peoples, and her political andadministrative entities.&quot;Our most anxious desire is to see a real and immediate advance madetowards this goal, and in the belief that the time has now come when therate of progress may be accelerated on definite lines, we propose :-(a) &quot; To develop, urban and rural self-government in the direction ofgiving greater powers to the local boards and councils, and makingthese more predominantly non-official and elective in character,while at the same time extending the franchise in the wards orother constituencies by which the elected members are chosen.(5) &quot; To increase the proportion of Indians in the higher branches of thepublic service, and thereby to enable Indians to take a moreimportant part in the administration of the country.(c) &quot; To pave the way for an ultimate enlargement of the constitutionalpowers of the provincial legislative councils (i) through anincrease in the elected element; and (ii) through a materialexpansion of the constituencies by which the elected members arechosen, so as to bring about a state of things under which theywill become more truly representative of the interests of the peopleas a whole.&quot;.
