^ HALL^.^   Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.CRV7/006.Section -C*\7eekly Report on Russia. VI.(May 28, 191?.)I, The Task of the Coalition Government.The first Revolutionary Government set up by the Duma lasted3 than two months and with the formation of the Coalition Russiabe said to be entering the second period of the Revolution,new Government has the advantage of containing some of the mostive and efficient men in RusBia, not one of whom has arousedility against himself for his past political career.     This isimportant factor with an absolutely unbridled press and it is cleart the failure of the former Government wao largely the result ofviolent agitation against Messrs. Guchkov and Milyukov.The outstanding figure in the new Government is Mr. Kerenskiindeed it may be said that the success of the Government dependsi the success of Mr. Kerenski in his new post.    Ho man has doneto save Russia from civil war since the Revolution, and providedJan retain his hold over the people he may yet achieve wonders.Extremists have not been able to discredit him owing to hissistcnoy.     While proclaiming the vigorous prosecution of the wariiaa at the same time never swerved in his views regarding war aim a.and his supporters maintain that, before appealing to the Allies?- reconsideration of their common war aims, discipline in the   .sian. army must be restored and a real offensive must be enteredIf he fails there is little doubt that conditions at the front1 grow rapidly worse and in such a case it is not unlikely thatkind of counter-revolution might take place*
11 *   The Socialist Parties and the Government.The Coalition Government contains 6 Socialists and has the supportf the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers1 Delegates.     Socialism iniesia was before the Revolution divided into a large number of smallfoupsi out as a result of recent efforts towards union there are nowmain parties, the Social Revolutionaries represented in the GovernmentMessrs. Kerenski, Chernov and Pyeshekhonov, the Moderate Socialmocrats (or Minimalists) represented by Messrs. Tseretelli andobeleVi and the Extremists (or Maximalists),led  by Messrs. Lenind Zinovyev, v/ho are not represented in the Government.     The othericialist in the Government, Mr. Pereveyezev, is not a very prominentd and is more of a Radical than a strict Socialist.Y/ith the exception Of Messrs. Chernov and Tseretelli the Social-its v/ho have joined the Government are not the recognised leaders ofic movement.     This means that the C.w*.S.D. will continue to ex*oiDo very strong pressure on the Government under leaders such asikhoidze, Martov and Stcklov.    These men have a large majority overextreme agitators and will not do anything to impede Mr. Kerenskii hie task of reorganising the army.     It is probably when theicstion of war aims arises that they v.ill try to make their influencefit.   Hoanwhilc they support the Government.Light is thrown on the attitude of the C.W.S.D. towards thertromiets by tho following quotation from a recent speech by Mr.cljeigv, now Minister of Labour;-     &quot;We must not forget that we nowfre freedom of speech.     Anyone can say what he likes.     Let them&apos;lk but wo will not allow them to act.     The first thing we have to doto defeat Germany.&quot;III.    V/ar Aims.Mr. Tcreshchenko is obviously doing what he can not to embarrassAllied Government on the question of war aims, and there ie littletot that he will be ready to understand and interpret the point of
- 3 -view of Great Britain and Prance about &quot;no annexation&quot;.     It ispossible that while Mr. Kerenski is at the front this question maynot be raised again in an acute form.     Meanwhile it is interestingto notice the peace terms set forth by Steklov in Maxim Gorki&apos;s newpaper.     Steklov is President of the Executive Committee of theC.W.S.D. and his views may be taken as representing the kind ofpressure that will be brought to bear on the Government.    Afteranswering the German Socialist peace terms as enumerated by theDanish Socialist Borgbjerg he writes as follows:-&quot;The right of peoples to self-determination which is recognisedby Socialists includes the right to independent political existence jbut Li the German programme it is confined to cultural autonomy forthe nation concerned. It goes without saying that the Socialists,md particularly Russian revolutionary democracy, will hardly agreeto ouch a restricted interpretation of self-determination.&quot;To quote a special instance.     Scheidemann and his followersagnanimously offer Russian Poland full liberty to choose her ownfate, but say not a word about German and Austrian Poland.     Defendingrulgaria&apos;s right to the Bulgarian districts of Macedonia, to whicho true democrat can object, they forget the rights of the Serbs anduraanians living in Austria-Hungary to a free decision of the questionf their political existence.&quot;Steklov further objects to the German Socialist Solution of theioace-Lorraine question, and supports the view of those Frenchocialists who favour a plebiscite.As regards indemnities he writes as follows:-&quot;Take the question of reparation (i.e. compensation for Belgium,ia, Poland, Northern Prance, etc).     The English, French andians relate this question to the question of who were to blame forwar.     But in view of the difficulty and the uselessness of
eciding the question in^ifcie  nay, it may be said that the questionf compensation for looses suffered by various countries should beecided by an international loan into which would be brought especiallyhose States which have gained materially from the wari i.e. above allhe neutral States.     In Borgb4erg&apos;s words the Scandinavian countriesftre ready to take an active part in finding the financial meanseeded.&quot;It may be added that though the chief stumbling block to Russianocialists in the note to President Wilson is the part referring toustria-Eungary there need be no difficulty in seeing eye to eye withhem in this respect.     Russian Socialists do not favour^a ^solutioncf the question of the nationalities.    It is only the way in whichhe question was dealt with that they object to; they suspected thefirms of the Allied note because they imagined that they were onlyJieant to serve the interests of Imperialist Russia.     For example theyobject to the division of Austria between Italy. Serbia and Rumaniais the spoils of victory, though they are willing to accept any-rritorial changes that the peoples themselves desire.     The followingnotation from a Socialist paper in close touoh with Mr. Keren ski willhelp to explain their point of view:-&quot;The chief fault to be found with the Allied note was that whilepinging forward the principle of the self-determination of nation-lit ies and proclaiming the necessity of changing the map of Europeon the basis of this principle they decided in advance on the dis-Jomberment of A u stria-Hungary without-having found out first theopinion of the people concerned.nThis is hardly a fair oritioism of the Allied note which onlyroclaimed the liberation of the peoples of Austria-Hungary, but itogs show that the Russian Socialists are quite willing to apply therinciplo of self-determination in dealing with the future of the Dualanarchy.
IV.   The Land Question.Peasant riots are still reported, the most serious oneshaving taken place at Minsk.     Isolated riots are inevitable, &quot;jut ,thereis reason to hope that the peasantry as It whole will not cause anyserious trouble until the harvest has been gathered.     The peasant isnot covetous as a rule of what belongs to another and is not likelyto seize the harvest for himself, but as regards land lie recognisesno right of property, his guiding idea being that the land belongsto the people and that each man should have as much as he can workhimself.    At a recent peasant meeting in the South of Russia it wasdecided that &quot;the land, v/ater, air and mineral riches of&apos;the earthought to be the property of the whole people1.5.These - suppositions are borne out by tho following statementstaken from a recent despatch from Sir G. Buchanan:-     1)    &quot;Thepeasants take for granted that they will divide all the land betweenthem in the near future, but I am informed by several owners ofestates that they recognise the necessity of assuring the harvest onthe properties of which they have not yet taken possession.&quot;   2)   Mr.Bagge, acting Consul-General at Odessa reports that the mass of thepopulation are determined to do their best to ensure a good harvest.&quot;If there is trouble among the peasantry it is likely to becomeserious after the,harvest especially in the South of Russia among theUkrainians who are much  more excitable than the Great Russians of thetforth.     Owing to their ignorance peasants can easily be excited byall kinds of false prophets and agents, and the real danger zone inthe future may be in the country between Kiev and Odessa together withBessarabia.     In tho latter province the agent3 of the old regime arealready active, and Odessa itself with its mixed population is alwaysn. centre of dagger.
