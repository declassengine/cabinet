WAR CABINET.a.T. 891.REPORT&apos; 07 MESOPOTAMIA COMMISSION.Remarks by. the Chief of the Imperial General Staff with regardto its publication.Secretary       ...War Cabinet.I am returning herewith the report of the MesopotamiaCommission,;     I think it is regrettable that the report should bepublished during-the war,  as it reflects&apos;g re at disared.it o:a manyIiigh officials and on the manner in which the operations wereplanned and conducted, both from a General Staff and. Administrative..standpoint.     The .result, of this must be to encourage the enemy, andseriously to. diminish the confidenee of the public and fightingservices - An. their leaders.     I consider it my duty to poir.it this out,although as the. Commission was appointed, I presume the Report must-be published. ,Subject toj the above, the passages which, from a purelymilitary point of view, should be &apos;omitted are those marked in bluepencil on pages 12, 24, 43 and 97, and the passages in Part V con-taihing references to the impolicy of evacuating Baghdad once ithas-.been occupied..   These references tend to indicate to the enemythe importance which we attach,to the retention of Baghdad, and maycause, him to make special efforts for its recapture,I notice, also, that the report contains^many referencesto our- policy in Mesopotamia, but 1 presume that the Foreign Officeand mdia Office will express an opinion as. to the advisabilityof retaining them.(Sgd)     .
