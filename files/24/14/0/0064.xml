rMay 21st to May 28th, 1917,During last week there does not seem to have been any eventor new movement of importance in. Germany.    The situation con-tinues as it was.    For internal purposes the Chancellor is de-pending on his Central &quot;Block&quot;, and at the same time is workingapparently in close understanding with Count Csernin, whileCount Hertling, Minister-President of Bavaria, is giving hisassistance.    As explained before, this means that the Cban-eellor is^dependent on the Moderate elements in the country,especially on the Catholic party.The subjects of discussion with Austria1 are undoubtedlythe prospects of a settlement on the Eastern frontier, and asan essential part of this, a decision as to the Polish question.Everything points to this decision being made very soon and wemay probably expect some public announcement almost immediately.It is of course hoped that this may help to some agreement withRussia.We get information from many sources as to the extremeunpopularity of the Germans, both in Austria and in Hungary,and the friction which exists, for instance, between theofficers, and even in diplomatic circles.     There is no doubtthat this ill-feeling exists;   it would however be hazardousto attach too much political importance to it, and anyhowthere is no reason to suppose that there&apos; is any similar ill-feeling at present be two on the Governments of the two Allies.What^Kr d^Si^a the p&amp;actjf ijbri. Emperor may snte?*tain as toeateKJ^xSjag grGatj*.jr ^dependence of Germany, this is not themoment in- which he sen do -so:.
with reference to the position now taken by the CentreParty, it appears that Qrzberger, as already pointed out bybir baiter Townley, has to some extent changed his position;it is stated that he is becoming &quot;an apostle of pessimism&quot;and in that character is working for peace.     The influentialpart which is now being taken by the Catholics is worth noting,and it would be well to take every opportunity of gainingfurther information about it.     It is quite possible thatthe key of much which is happening might be found in theVatican and disoreet enquiries might even be made in BomanCatholic circles in England.Meanwhile * as last week, every possible effort is beingmade to keep up the spirits of the German nation by insistingon submarine, successes and the successful resistance on theWestern front, the object being to get the people over theperiod of extreme stress which will continue until the newharvest comes in.Considerable importance has been attached to an articlewhich appeared in the Bayersche Staatszeitung of May 8, suggest-ing that indemnities were not necessary;   more important wasit to secure a plentiful supply of raw.material after the warand to prevent any trading boycott of Germany.     This articleappeared just after Count Hertling returned from Vienna, andit was suggested at the time that this meant that he andCount Czernin were bringing pressure to bear upon the GermanGovernment.     As a matter of fact the idea was first suggestedin a Berlin paper.     It seems more probable that this was a&quot;ballon dSessai&quot; thrown out by the Chancellor himself.   Seeingthe improbability of gaining the indemnities which CountReventlow and other writers insist are essential to the futureof Germany, he was beginning to educate the German people tobelieve that the? essential thing is to come out of the war
Qfree from the impediments to German trade, which were adumbratedby the Paris Conference.    If he could secure the integrity ofAustria-hungary, the continued alliance with Bulgaria, and there-by a strong influence over the Balkans, and if at the same time,the Mains-Danube Canal were made, the essence of the Central 3uro-pean &quot;Block&quot; would be preserved and Germany would still be insuch a position as to be able to look forward to a prosperousfuture, even though there were no annexations and ad; indemnities.ill this is in accordance with the general view that he, is work-ing with persistency and skill to get an early peaoe pn. any termswhich will insure the future of Germany.Reference has already been made to the projeoi of a shippingcanal connecting the Maine with the Danube,    This proposal isone which had been before the public for many years, but it is nowbeing pressed forward with more energy.   The ultimate object is&apos;tocreate a waterway for seagoing ships connecting the Black Sea withthe great canal and river system of North Germany.    It.is a pro-ject which, if carried out, might be of great Importance, and at&quot;the present moment has real political weight.     The effect of itwould be, by creating a great channel of communication independentof the sea, to bind together the continent of Europe.   In accor-danee with the characteristic German habit of regarding mattersof transport and of commerce in the view of great political idealsit will probably come more and more to represent a union of thecontinental juropean States against Anglo-Saxondom.     This is amatter of which we shall hear more and which I hope to deal withmore fully later.    Per the moment it^is sufficient to note thatas we lay stress on the union of the English-speaking nations,the Germans will try to raise alarm as, to the world-domination ofthe English and will lay stress on the idea of the common interests
of &quot;Europe.     As it is hopeless to. infl^enc^ rrarioe, theywill use tills,  or pro^a^anda- in Russia and. in the neutralstates.J. W. E-29th Hay, 1917-
