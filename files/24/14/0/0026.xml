Special Memorandum on Crisis in Poland.There is an acute crisis in Poland.     The agreement concludedtowards the end of March or in the beginning of April between theCentral Powers and the Polish Council of State has clearly brokendown.    The Polish Council of State does not dare to issue arecruiting appeal; they know that under present conditions thenumber of men who would spontaneously come forward to serve in anarmy under the command of the German Governor-General von Beselerwould be negligible, but that the Socialist and Radical organisa-tions might enlist en bloc in order to revolutionise the army.Unrest, both political and social, is spreading..    Strikes inmanufacturing and mining districts - German troops in Lodz firedat the people - small incidents lead to sharp conflicts (cf. thestrike at the War saw University and high schools); revolution is inthe air.     After four months of strenuous work the Council of Statehas no results to show because it has no power to carry out itsschemes; the government of Poland is still in the hands of theCentral Powers.     The lame compromise concluded with them beforethe Russian Revolution is acceptable no longer.     The &quot;Left&quot; hasnow openly declared that it considers harmful the further existenceof the Provisional Council of State and some of its groups haveactually recalled their representatives from it.       They demand thata Polish Constituent Assembly be summoned and that a true Polishgovernment be formed.Also the Conservative elements see that the present situationis untenable.     But what they want is not merely to create thePolish State, but to create it on a basis which would secure ,rlawand order&quot; as they understand it.     If there ie no Polish governmentthe%
the Polish national cause once more assumes a revolutionary character.But if there is a Polish Regent and a Polish government every popularmovement will he decried as high treason, as sacrilege against thatInestimable, recovered but as yet very precarious treasure, thenational Polish Monarchy.     It will then be possible to form a con-Ciript army - conscription is of course inadmissible from the Polishnational point of view as long as the control of this army would beI in German hands.     Y/ith a view to internal policy a conscript armywould be preferable to the Conservatives rather than an army ofI urbulent volunteers.     The Polish Regent and government would become[the rallying point of all counter-revolutionary forces and the army[their sword.     But at the same time even the most ext*reme revolutionaries[would have to admit that such a Polish government would be a decidedimprovement on the rule of German and Austrian governors.The Central Powers may now see that they must at laat agree as toa final settlement of the problem because (a) the present position inPoland is untenable, (b) it is to their interest to create the faitaccompli of a settlement in Poland; this would strengthen their handf&apos;in the Polish Question at the coming peace congress.     Although nothingabout the actual course of negotiations for the new Polish settlementis allowed to appear in the press the following conclusions are suggestedby certain incidental remarks which, if taken together and carefullyanalysed, offer fairly good ground for judgment;(l)    That the Polish Council of State passed on May 1 a[resolution in favour of the immediate appointment of a Poliah Regent.(2)     That negotiations about it have been carried on by the5olish &quot;Minister of Political Affairs&quot; (wkich really means foreign[affairs), Count \i. Roetworowski at Vienna and Berlin - he was receivedty&quot; Herr von Zimmermann on May 2.(3)   That no positive results were reached at this conferencefhough some principles may -have been agreed upon.
(4)    That Vienna and Berlin decided not to allow Gallcia to b included in the new Poland; this decision caused a violent outburstof opposition from the Galician Poles who demand the union of Galiciafrith the Kingdom of Poland.     The Central Powers may yet be forced toive way to their pressure.(5)    The Central Powers- will probably do all they can to avoidking the new Polish settlement a bar to negotiations with Russia,ut will still try to fix in it certain principles with regard to-olend which they desire to carry at the Peace Congress.     If theews is true which was published in the l^^Jxrt erjl&amp;z ette ofay 16 and which alleged that Count \7. Rostworowski met Generalatianski at Stockholm, this may have been an attempt to use him asintermediary in order to sound the opinion of certain circles in:.5 Russian government concerning the new settlement.LM. 24/5/17
