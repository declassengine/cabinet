83CBITWAR CABINET *G.T. 885 . -.       XJQITQR RESTRICTIONS AND CONTROL.   .&apos; Report by Lord Milner -   Bee War Cabinet 138, (5)- At&apos;the&quot;request of.the Prime Minister I have had two inter-views with a number of representative brewers introduced by SirGeorge Younger.     These meetings were held at 3 Whitehall Gardenson Thursday, May 17th and Friday May 85th.     Those present were:.: Mr&apos;. S.O.Neville,      -Colonel Gretton   .     Sir George YoungerColonel Alison       Colonel Gaekell Colonel Hell WalkerMr:.Sykee, Mr.Watson Lovibond,   Sir Edward Holt,Mr.Percy Reid,Mr.Watson Lovlto nd was present only at the second meet!ng.There was a very full&quot; and frank discussion.   Some of thosepresent,were at first evidently under the impression that the:control which the Government proposed to exercise was; rather alimited affair, and that they would be able to resume theirbusinesses at the end of it practically unaltered with a solatium&apos;for temporary distnrbance.     But when the extent of.the difficultywith which we are confronted, came to be realised, and they under-stood that, in order to mfeke the available stock of malt goround, a general dilution of beer would have to.be resorted to,that a number of public houses and even breweries would have, tohe closed, etc., etc *, I. think they all recognised that the ; .interference with their, business,, the pra&amp;tical wreckage of good-will, pointed to such a &quot;pig figure of compensation, that it couldnever be entertained without the State getting some quid pro quo,and that Purchase was- therefore the only ultimate possible solut-ion.     They did&apos;not pretend to like it, but they adopted a veryreasonable attitude., fully understanding that the Government., wasnot taking up the question Otherwise than from sheer necessity,and owing to the difficulties with which it is confronted, inconsequence of the war. - Reluctantly admitting that State Con-trol was forced upon us, and that it involved steps which wouldinjure their businesses, or many of them, beyond:hope of repair,they expressed themselves quite,willing to give the Governmentevery assistance in their power in making the new system workwhich could only be done with the help of        people conversant -with the Trade - provided, of course, that they were assuredof -getting a fair price for the business which the State-wasgoing.to take away from them. -The basis .on which such a price, could be fixed was theSubject of a good deal of discussion, and - several useful sugges-tions were made. .   What, it all came to, however, was that theremust be a strong commission or committee appointed to lay downthe principles on which the Trevors&apos; interests could be ulti-mately taken over, Tsefore which comiLitteesitting in private,the representatives of the trade should have an opportunity ofstating; their views.   It was strongly urged that this committeeshould be appointed without delay, as the trade could not be expectedto acquiesce in the taking over of control by tbe Governmentwithout knowing **hat it had to expect in the way of ultimatepayment.        I want to make it quite clear that nobody/
J-2-suggested that the brewers should be bought out at once, thoughit was pointed out that some immediate payment would have to bemade to dispossessed retailers,.     &quot;What was insisted on was thatthe terms- on which purchase was ultimately to be effected,&quot;shouldbe settled before steps were taken to disturb the trade.     Thisv/as assuming-that the Government would be very unlikely to take   .the alternative course - cf agreeing., in lieu of purchase, topay compensation for disturbance., having regard to the-enormousfigures to which such compensation might run.     The. brewers nodoubt would prefer the latter course, but none of them expectthat it will be adopted.The immediate question before the Cabinet is whether itshould appoint&apos; the ccnt-ssiplat ed finance-committee.     It seems tome that this is an absolute necessity, and that no time should belest.     We shall be pressed,. when Parliament meets, tc state curpolicy, and once we announce it, we shall be bombarded withinquiries by the trade and&apos; the enemies of the trade,., as t^v how wepropose to deal with the interests, involved;    and we ought to bein a position to reply, that the basis of the necessary, financialprovisions - is being examined by a strong, disinterested authority.No progress ean be.made until the brewers know what fate awaitsthem,- but if conditions of ultimate purchase were laid down,which they, regarded as reasonable, I believe, any serious, opposi-tion on their part and on that -cf the Unionist&apos; Party, would dis-appear. ..  On the other hand, a great number of the Liberal Partywould, I believe,, be attracted by the prospeot of the immediateclosing of a great number of public houses and the general intro-duotion cf lighter beers, coupled with the promise, of localoption after, the war.     The Nationalists are in favour of Purchase..any way.Under these circumstances, I am inclined to think that theOpposition which our proposals would have to encounter,except fr:mthe extreme Temperance men and perhaps a majority of the ScottishLiberals,has been rather over-estimated,and that a short Bill,-like that already before the Cabinet,with a Schedule laying dosrnthe basses of. ultimate purchase as determined by the-  proposedfinancial committee, would not be so difficult to pass as we havebeen led to think..     But whether we ultimately determine .to.-intro-duce a Bill or not? we can make no progress at all until thesebases are determined,and for this reason I would again urge thatthe appointment of a committee - which,if set up at once,mightget through its business in a few weeks - is of the greatest importance,/ -There is only one other point on which I should be glad cf a^decision.   The Licensed Victual1ers are all in a great state of^agitation,, and&quot; are clamouring to see me or some representative ofthe Government.    I think it would be a good thing to see .them,tolet. them know what is proposed, and to give them the assurance,already given to the brewers,that if the contemplated committeeis set up,they will have every opportunity of represer&amp;ing their-ease before it.    But I think it would be better not to see themuntil I,or,any other member .of the Government who may be deputedto do so,is in a position-to say at least as much as that.May 30th, 1917.(Intd.)   M.
