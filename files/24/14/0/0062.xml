SSO.3het299G.T. 862FOR THE IHFOMATI02T OF THE WAR CABINETFROM THE FIRST. SEA LORD.    .The Shipping Situation.The best indication of the extreme gravity of the presentsituation and the absolute impossibility of continuing the Warwithout a reduction of our present commitments is given bythe fact that we have been forced to inform the French Govern-ment that we are now bound to withdraw a 100 ocean-goingmerchant ships from their use.     Of these, about 40 havealready been withdrawn and, under the most urgent represents-?,tions of M. Violette, we have very reluctantly consented topostpone the withdrawal of the remainder until&apos;July and August.Without the use Of these ships it is quite impossible toensure the import into this country of the commodities whichare absolutely   essential for the continuance of the War.Even after the withdrawal of these-ships we shall at theend of July be 300 ocean-going steamers short of what we thinkis the number of vessels necessary to bring essential commodi-ties into this country..Moreover, this withdrawal of ships does not in any way.assist.us in providing France and Italy with further coalsupplies for which they are daily clamouring and without whichthe two Governments state they will be very seriously&apos; handiicapped in the prosecution of the War:    indeed, the ItalianGovernment has gone so far as to say that without increasedcoal supplies their offensive is bound to stop.(Signed)    J.R. JELLICOE.ay 28th, 1917 .
