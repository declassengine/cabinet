CrCjOlIntelligence Bureau,Department of InformationSECTION   D. DSw/002.TEEKLY REPORT ON SERBIA.  II.May 23, 1917.&apos;636Montenegrofs Attitude to the Jugoslav Ideal,For a long time past there have been two sharply opposedpoints of view among the Montenegrins.   Most of the younger men,especially those of education and those who had been in America,were in touch with the Serbs and Croats and had enthusiasticallyembraced the Jugoslav idea.   On the other hand, Court circles anda o&amp;Y&amp;g&amp;VMsmS^ of the more reactionary politicians clung tothe old separatist Montenegrin standard.   The supporters of thisseparatist party, the head of viiich was naturally King Nicolashimself, were of two different types.   Some were sincere, ifnarrow-minded, Montenegrin patriots who had no ideal beyond per-sonal loyalty to the Petrovic dynasty and intense local feeling.A more dangerous element gathered round the worthless anddiseased Crown Prince Danilo (whose wife is a Mecklenburg princess)and his second brother Prince Mirko.   There is every reason tobelieve that Danilo and Mirko had for a long time past beenintriguing with Vienna.   They saw that if the Entente Powerswon the war and a Jugoslav State established Montenegro mustsooner or later be attracted into its orbit.   The Central Powersin the event of victory promised them a continuation of theirdynasty either loosely under or nominally independent of Habsburgrule, and together with this an extension of Montenegrin rule toinclude parts of N.V. Serbia.   It was generally considered inMontenegro that the fall of Mt. Lovtfen on January 10, 1916,was due to collusion on the part of the Royal House.   King Nicolasindeed loudly protested his loyalty to the Entente&apos;s cause and
withdrew to France with his daughter the Princess Xenia.   ButPrince Mirko went off to Vienna &quot;to consult&quot; an occulist&quot; andhas since then remained there.   The Neue Freie Presse at the timewas bubbling over with good news about the success?&quot;bf the Great-Montenegro intrigue and had to he heavily censored by the waryAustrian authorities.To placate public indignation in Montenegro and allay theEntente Powers&apos; distrust King Nicolas soon afterwards called topower Mr Andrija Radovi6, one of the younger school of politicians,devoted to the Jugoslav ideal.   Mr Radovic in 1908 had been involvedthein the notorious Cetinje treason trial instigated by/King (thenPrince Nicolas) and his relations with the King were consequentlynot of the friendliest.   King Nicolas was, however, forced toleave Mr Radovii in office during the greater part of 1916, andit was only in December last that he dismissed him and recalledan old court favourite, Dr Tomanovid, to office.It was practically a declaration of war on the democratic,Jugoslav movement in Montenegro.   As such Mr Radovi6 and his friendshave taken it.   They have now formed in Geneva a &quot;Comite Montenegrinpour 1&apos;Union Nationale&quot;.     Mr Radovic himself is President and theother members of the Committee are Messrs Pero Vucekovi6 (ex-Minister of Public Instruction), Janko Spasojevi6 (deputy and ex-Minister of Justice), Danilo,Gatalo (ex-Minister of War) andMilos/ Ivanovi6.     The first number of their organ LjUnion appearedat Geneva on April 28.In an   appeal they have published to the Montenegrin nationthe Committee definitely accuses the &quot;rulers of Montenegro&quot; ofhaving betrayed Mt. Lovoen and the army to the enemy.   They callon all Montenegrins to rally to the Jugoslav cause in Ttfiich theydeclare their whole-hearted faith.   &quot;Serbia and Montenegro, unitedto all the other Serbian lands, Croatia and Slovenia (i.e. theg Slovene territories in Oarniola, Styria, Istria, etc.) will form
our great Fatherland - that which was the dream of whole centuriesand for which Yvas shed the best blood of so many generations&quot;.There is little doubt that the Committee&apos;s views will finda ready welcome among most progressive Montenegrins, who seeMontenegrofs political and economic future indissolubly boundup with the union of all the Jugoslav lands *The Serbian Conspiracy Trial.The political character and import of the trial and con-demnation of General Damian Popovi6 and his associates were. -dealt with in a special memorandum written by Mr Seton-Y;atsonfor this section yesterday.A .H&quot;.A.L*May 23, 1917.
