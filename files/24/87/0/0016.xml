&quot; .... 34(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVIBRBOTT-..)Hy&quot;&quot; &apos;W/     PRESENT POSITION OF HOUSING.  :, H..8.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.igtotoiteATlVE AND LEGISLATIVE MEASURES.As explained in my Memorandum (G.235), the position at the beginning of the year was that 108 schemes relating to sites and 52 relating to houses, were before the Department. Many of&apos;these were defective schemes.   None had been approved and no land for housing finally acquired.   There was no organisation either centrally or locally competent to deal with the housing, programme of the Government; .and the legal powers then possessed were dilatory and cumbrous to.the last degree and quite unequal to the task before us.   It was. necessary therefore, in the first place, to set about the . creation of the necessary, organisation both centrally and locally, to assist and urge Local Authorities to do the same, to&apos; revise the scheme of financial assistance and to prepare a Bill providing the necessary powers, (a)   ORGANISATION, ,The Housing Department at Whitehall has been completely reorganised and greatly augmented by administrative and technical ,staff,   A system^ of decentralisation has al30 been inaugurated and the country divided into 11 Regions under Housing Commissioners.   These Commissioners are equipped with the necessary clerical and technical staff, and are dealing with cases in their areas through all the preliminary stages. In view of the difficulties of London, a.special organisation was set up,.and the office of the Housing Commissioner for the-1-.
Area was associated with a Housing Board for London, consist-ing of Sir John Tudor Walters, M.P;   Sir Kingsley Wood, M.P. and Mr. Strauss, M.P.The principal difficulty in the creation of pur organisation arose from the fact that active men with techni-cal experience were for the most part in the Army and it was not until the month of May that it could be said to be in working order.(b)   LEGISLATION.The Housing Bill was introduced on March 18th. and became law -on July 31st.   Under its provisions,.it will be possible to evade a multitude of complexities and delays in the provision of new-houses and for the first time to make use of suitable empty houses and to adapt or improve suitable existing occupied houses *(o)   FINANCE Ofr HOUSING.The terms granted to Local Authorities were announced on the 6th February and those to Public Utility Societies on the 24th March. . There has been a great response to these financial proposals.(II).    -PROGRESS PROM JANUARY TO PASSING OF HOUSING ACT.(A). PERMANENT ACCOMMODATION. . (l)   NEW BUILDINGS.Having regard to the dilatory powers under which we were obliged to work, the progress made during this period was better in many respects than could have been expected, and I attribute this in a substantial measure, apart from the zeal of the staff and the ready help of the authorities, to the assistance of Members of Parliament who have formed for the purpose a Housing Committee which meets weekly under the Chairmanship of Sir Tudor Waiters.
38 iMj(a) SITES.Up to August 9th, 1,165 different site applications covering 16,475 acres had been approved and the total number of site applications submitted amounted to 4,003 involving in all 38,303 acres.   Allowing 10 houses to the acre, it will be Seen that the area of land already submitted for approval, will be sufficient for over 380,000 houses,(b) COST OF LAND.Officers of the Inland Revenue Department attached to us for this purpose advise as to valuation and have effected great economies.   The cost of the first 28,214 acres valued proved to be  4,919,681, or an average of  170 per acre.   In view of the fact that the bulk of the land thus early acquired is in the neighbourhood of towns, the average cost per acre is, I think, less than would have been anticipated.   At 10 houses to the acre and at 5^, it represents 4d. per week in the rent.(o)   LAY OUT OF THE SITES FOR. HOUSING.I instructed the Department in these early stages to concentrate in passing the larger of them and those near the chief centres of population.   Full details of these are shovffi in the printed Return&apos; (and.285) giving detailed particulars to the end of June.Plans for the lay-out of the sites for houses, streets, etc, have been received in 670 oases, of which 288 have been finally approved.The average area in these appiroved is about 14 acres and the approved schemes represent over 40,000 houses. Many of the schemes are pisaced on excellent and far-sighted lines and will provide encouraging examples of modern housing the following examples of soherss which provide for more than 500 houses on each site may be of interest. The number of houses may be calculated by reckoning 10. to the aore:-

It should be jointed but, however, that the approved plans in very many cases are of blocks of 20 to 50 houses which will be reproduced as building on the site develops and the figures given therefore represent a much larger number of houses of which the type has been approved.(e) WORK IN PROGRESS.   ,A system of frequent reporting has been instituted and is gradually becoming of .a more reliable character as Local Authorities come to appreciate its importance, but a large number of them have hitherto failed to make the returns asked for.   Up to the end of July, work is know, to have been begun in the places set out below.   In many of them operations have not yet proceeded beyond work on the streets, sewers and preparation of the ground.   Whenever we have had reported the number of actual houses erected or in course of erection, the

The organisation was, however, prepared inadvance and, after the passage of the Bill on July Slat,...aotion waa taken forthwith.I am at preBent only surveying empty houaea auitable
for adaptation for family dwellings - mostly in the form of 2 or 3 flats - in the Metropolitan area, &quot;but the arrangements for&apos; extending this work are already well advanoed.

Up to &amp;usust&apos; 12th, the number inspected and approved are as follows:-^sjoeoted - 325. Approved - 514.It is anticipated that the houses will average the provision for 3 fancies each.      A survey of accommodation other
than in houses which may he made use of under the new powers in such cases as hostels, in others for family use, - will then follow,   A Manual and typical plans is &quot;being prepared for the use of Local Authorities to assist them with this work.&apos;   Copies will he made available to xn&amp;members  of the Cabinet shortly.An arrangement has been made with the Chancellor of the Exchequer un,der which  500,000 ,is placed at the. disposal of the Ministry of Health during the coming months to enable us directly to&apos; make a, start with this work in oases where the Local Authorities are not yet prepared to do bo.(l)   H^l^^lIOSTELS.The number of huts of a suitable kind which it has been possible for the War Office to pass to the Disposal Board has not been large up to the present.   The prices which are obtainable by the Disposal Board have been such as to make the purchase of a hut, and its removal and conversicr for housing purposes, so expensive that Local Authorities have been very reluctant to use them.   On many occasions we have pressed their use upon Authorities and have been met by a refusal to take them on the ground, first, of expense and, second, of the unpopularity of the proposal with the people.The use of huts has, however,, been adopted in various places -Hammersmith, Eastbourne, Manchester, ..Liverpool., Poplar,. Cannock and Darlington are the most important up to the present.The obstacle of cost, has, I hope, now been substantially met under the arrangements sanctioned by the Home Affairs Committee on August 6th.&apos; under which huts -of a suitable kind may be inspected and approved by us and placed at the disposal of the Local Authorities at a discount ofand the Ministry of Health stands temporarily possessed
Of hostels for the same purposes, Upon these terms&apos;,, we shall he able to make a much better use of this temporary provision under our new direct powers.The best, however * that We con do will go but a very little way to satisfy local needs and will, in many cases, I am afraid, prove to be very unpopular in the winter months,(2)   UN3ATISPaQTORY HOUSES.Arrangements are being made with the County Medical Officers of Health for a suitable organisation attached to each Housing Commissioner to secure a survey of unsatisfactory dwellings in town and country, with a view to their improve-ment or scheduling for acquisition and clearance as alterna*-tive accommodation becomes available.   Under the terms of the new Act, the acquisition of condemned property can be made on terms which will enable us to embody in the schemes plans for reconstruction in slum areas long urgently needed,(III).WlSOSLLMSOUS ADMINI3TRATI VJJl POINTS, (l)   MATERIALS.* &apos; 4MMlHUt%ii., ii.lii.ltl  mi.The supply of building materials, thanks to the efforts of the Ministry of Munitions, gives no cause for anxiety, and there are good stocks available.   As to pricej the Ministry has secured good terms as compared with those available for private purchases;   and the prices are much lower than the exaggerated accounts which Often appear would lead people to suppose.   Arrangements also are being made to make them available on suitable terms for persons building houses privately which are approved by us as in the interests of housing.(2)   L^OUR.There is already in many districts a shortage of skilled building labour.   This is due partly to the real
* . -43depletion of the industry during the War and to the great demands for other types of &quot;building.   The Ministry of Labour for some time past has been conducting negotiations with the ^ building trades and the Joint Industrial Council,with a viewto a provision of a scheme whereby additional labour may be made available with, let us hope, increased productive effort on the part of those working.   Up. to the present, I regret to say that, so far as I am aware, no definite arrangement has yet been reached, (3)   FIJMOE.A Finance and Costing organisation has been set up and is working in close touch with a small expert Finance Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Gilbert Garnsey. The arrangements for checking costs of building and of the acquisition of land are, I think, working satisfactorily, but the question of devising suitable checks on extravagance which will not involve delays raises many difficulties.   I believe, however, that the arrangements we are establishing in consultation with the Treasury are on sound lines. (4)   CTAZI)AIII)KL CATI0Ij8r -- Miff DESIGNS, etcTwo Committees of experts have been engaged for some time on the preparation of standard specifications, and forms of contract, and also upon the investigation of new methods of construction. -12 houses of the concrete-block type of a new design are being erected at Redcar and 50 others are authorised there as well as another group of a different type of 24 at Luton-, . According to the tenders, none of these houses should cost more than  500 and other types -are being arranged for.. Hew expedients in building . construction are being carefully watched and tested.I have only attempted to set out, above a few of 1 the more important steps Which have been taken to assist       flocal authorities in the preparation and execution of their schemes, and to keep the cost vJthin reasonable limits.C.
