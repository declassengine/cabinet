This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.WAR CABINET.fmW   THE SITUATION IN NORTH RUSSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETAEY OF STATE FOR WAR.- I circulate a precis by the Russian Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires in Paris of a telegram from General Miller to Admiral Koltchak. It has been shown to Mr. Balfour and the French Government.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.16^ August, 1919.General Miller, Governor-General of North Russia, communicates that, owing to the limited number of troops and the unsatisfactory state of moral of part of them, it will be impossible to hold the present front in case the British and other Allied forces withdraw.The men would lose faith in their superior strength over the Bolsheviks and in the possibility of holding the territory which is in their possession at present. It is feared they would desert on a large scale with the intention of rescuing their own belongings in their villages.At present on the main front, from Onega to Pinega, there are 8,500 Russians and the same number of British troops. According to British estimates 23,000 Bolsheviks are opposing them. &apos;The Government of Northern Russia faces the following dilemma : either to resist with the help of the officers and men who will remain true to their duty until utter exhaustion in Archangel itself without hope of being able to last out longer than the end of October, a month after the withdrawal of the British, without being able to evacuate these forces at the last moment on account&quot;, of the ice; or, in time, to give up the struggle against the Bolsheviks in the northern region and to transfer all the officers, about 9,000, and the reliable elements among the men as well as all material to another front, either to Denikin&apos;s or may be even to Siberia, in order to be able to take part in further action against the oppressors. In the latter case it would be likewise absolutely necessary to protect the evacuation of all the elements likely to be persecuted by the Bolsheviks&apos; vengeance.If the operations in the northern region had the object of playing a useful part in the general plan of action against Bolsheviks, a decision regarding Archangel could be taken considering the situation on other fronts. Under these circumstances the whole question ought to &apos;be considered from a general standpoint whether it is not more profitable to immobilize a portion of the Bolshevik forces during the coming-months on the Archangel front at the cost of sacrificing the officers gathered &quot;there and part of the men and material and stocks, instead of liquidating the Archangel front about the beginning of October and using the forces elsewhere as reinforcements, say, on the Murmansk front. This latter alternative would either have the defensive object of retaining that unfrozen port, or of making an advance between the lakes which would be of use only in case of an offensive on Petrograd by the Finns or General Youdenitch&apos;s forces.The evacuation of Archangel and the liquidation of the Northern front would give the Bolsheviks a great moral and material advantage, which would be a considerable, encouragement for them, and might have a pernicious influence on other decisive front. This ought to be avoided if the possibility of reconsidering the general situation remains.General Miller, in transmitting the whole of this question to Admiral Koltchak&apos;s consideration, wishes at the same time that the entire problem be submitted to the judgment of the Allied Governments.The Russian Embassy begs to draw attention on the extreme gravity of the exposed situation due to the proposed withdrawal of British and other Allied contingents from Northern Russia, and-expresses the hope that this situation would be reconsidered in connection, with the whole complexity of questions concerning the Russian problem.(B1A/3S0)   70   8/19   H&amp;S   7421vro
