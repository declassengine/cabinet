From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2nd September 1919.(Received 8 a.m., 3rd.)346OTHMiJMear the line.Afghanistan. My telegram of the 31st August. Following from Landi Kotal 31st August: &quot; Letter from Afghan Home Minister to Ghaut, Foreign Secretary, dated 28th instant, received here to-day.   (Corrupt group.)&quot;After usual compliments he speaks of friendly letters sent or being sent by Amir to King Emperor, Viceroy and Grant.&quot; As regards Envoy, he says Amir is according him great kindness and most honourable treatment. But though permitted to return, it is not considered prudent to expose Envoy to risk due to our troops being at Dakka and Afghan tribes and troops being on and about road. When troops are withdrawn there will be no obstacle to Envoy coming through.&quot; Letter raises four other points : &quot; (a) Complaint at the non-withdrawal from Dakka.&quot; (6) Complaint at postal arrangements not being re-opened. Letter says a bag from Kabul containing official and commercial post, and also a mail from our Envoy had to be brought back to Kabul, being rejected at Dakka.&quot; (c) Complaints, about the delay in opening the caravan traffic.&quot; (d) Desires to know how Ghulam Haidar&apos;s accounts have been settled.&quot; As regards (b) above, Afghan postal people, who reported themselves at Dakka en route to Peshawar, were told they would have to wait until proper arrangements had been made at Peshawar on Grants arrival there, They produced no mail bag. It seems probable letters from Envoy have thus missed delivery.1&apos;tto
