His   ritannic IVJaj63tyfs GovernmentDIRECTORATE OF TOIJLIQENOB (Home Offloe)gpeoial Report No. 8.Sootland House, S.W.1.18th August, 1919. (Circulated by the Home Seoretary)THREATENS!) RBDUCTIOH OF FOOD 3UPPLIE3 FROM AFRICAhThe representative of the American Food Controller in this oountry is about to report to his Controller that, in view of the delay in handling perishable food stuffs imported from Amerioa, whioh resulted in the destruction of a large quantity, he was about to reoommend that the exports to the. United Kingdom should be out down very drastioally, and that instead of American exporters sending their produce to auotion in England, as at present, they should sell in Hew York to the British importer, who would thus take the risk of delay.    The oongestion referred to may have been due to the Railway and Dock Strikes in Liverpool and the North, or to defeotive management of transport, but he also complained of great oongestion in the London Docks and of ships having to lie for many days at the mouth of the river, for lack of dook accommodation.The Amerioan Ambassador was anxious not to put forward this report without some indication of how far Labour disturbances were to be expected in the near future.    An unofficial Intimation was given that, while it is impossible to make forecasts a week ahead as regards Labour, there is no reason at this moment to think that the dockers are oontemplating a strike, though it is possible that unrest among the Railwaymen may lead to looal stoppages.While publication of the faot that a reduction of food exports from America entailing a further rise in prioes is contemplated, might have a steadying effect upon Labour in this oountry, it would also entail a risk of frightening Amerioan exporters from sending supplies.    On the whole, it seems safer to make no publio announcement.B.H.T.
