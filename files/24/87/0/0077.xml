laMilitary Secret.10638077theestyit.From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,27th August 1919.(Received 28th.)1.1683.   27th August.   Malleson telegraphs 25th August, repeating Tehran : - &quot; Agapiev considers Bolshevics will not by any means drop their Afghan policy, even if peace is made and ratified by Amir. Bolshevics hope that Orenburg front will be opened within two or three months. Then, consequent on what they consider completion of (? Bolshevic), they can send very large forces to Turkestan. Their first object is to smash Bokhara completely. They will then invite and, i  necessary, compel Afghanistan to renew the war with India with a view to destroying British rule there.&apos;1 2. Persia, Agapiev considers, is also given very prominent place in Bolshevic-. Asiatic programme. Firstly, because they think political and economic conditions are most favourable for spread of their ideas; secondly, because Turkestan has never been self-supporting in food and is now much less so. Khorassan is therefore absolutely essential to them, and they consider that this will he most promising way to gaining over starving Turkman, who have no love for Persians and will readily join in any plan for invasion and loot of Khorassan. All Kazim Beg&apos;s work is devoted to this end.&quot; 3. On matters definitely known to us I have been able to check Agapiev&apos;s statements and have found them pretty correct, As he has apparently had special facilities for learning views of leading Bolshevics, I think his statements above may be taken as fairly representing Bolshevics&apos; policy.&quot;Agapiev is a Russian lawyer from Tashkent.
