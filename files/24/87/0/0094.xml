APPENDIX IX.318MINISTRY OF PENSIONS.PENSIONS  ESTIMATES.THE MINISTERS STATEMENT.In Committee of Supply on Thursday, July 31st, 1919, the Minister of Pensions, the Eight Hon. Sir Laming Wokthington Evans, Bart., M.P., pre-sented the estimates of the&apos;Ministry of Pensions for the current year. In moving a vote of  45,855,000 he said:  This is the first occasion upon which the Pensions Estimates have been presented in detail; during the war &quot;the expenditure on pensions was made out of the vote of credit, but now the Committee has the opportunity of considering&apos; estimates in the usual way. As I desire to put before the Committee a review of the administration and policy of the Ministry which must necessarily take some time, I shall not deal with the various items of expenditure unless questions are raised in the course of the Debate.Expenditure.I must, however, warn the Committee that the estimate, which amounts to nearly  73,000,000, is already out of date. Since that estimate was pre-sented additional expenditure has been authorised as I have from time to time announced. For example, there has been added a 20 per cent, bonus to officers&apos; retired pay and to alternative pensions for officers and men and their widows and certaiu pre-war disability pensions have been raised to the present rates, and these and other alterations will cost this year over  2,000,000. I shall presently inform the Committee of the decisions of the Government upon the recommendations made in the interim report of the Select Committee on Pensions. These decisions will call for an extra expenditure for the remainder of this year of about  l.l;000,000 so that the estimates we are considering should be treated as  86,000,000 and not as presented at just under  73,000,000. The increased expenditure, however, covers only a portion of this year and the Committee may like to know that for a full year, at least as long as the number of pensioners remains at or near the maximum, the rate will be about  96,000,000. i This is more than double the esti-mated expenditure for the previous year ending March 31st, 1919, which was  47,500,000 and more tlian four times the actual expenditure of the year before, i,e., the year ending March 31st, 1918, which was just over  23,000,000.(24525)   Wt. 15515-2726,  30,000.   8-19.   D &amp; S.  &amp; 2.Number of Pensioners.Perhaps before I proceed with my review, I should also give the Committee information as to the numbers of pensions, gratuities and final allow-ances in actual payment at the 30th June:--Officers and nurses drawing retired pay were............       19,879Officers&apos; widows numbered        ...        9,536,,      dependants        ......        4,961,,     children.....&apos;.      ...        9,196Total43,572The corresponding figures for other ianks are at the 30th June:-Men  ...     ............     875,687Widows      ............     216,890Dependants............     279,440ChildrenTotal ..1,372,017 968,0642,340,081It is never easy to recognise what figures mean; perhaps the number of pensioners will be realised when I say that they are almost exactly three times as great as the population of Liverpool.Administration.If the Committee &quot;will allow me,( I will first deal with administration indicating the steps I am taking to bring about improvement. Soon after I took office in January last, I entered into a detailed examination of the organisation of the Ministry. My attention was forcibly called^ to the almost universal complaints of delay which poured in upon me from every quarter. M.P.&apos;s wrote forwarding letters from constituents and the constituents wrote also. The Local War Pensions Committees com-plained that their letters to the Department were not answered and often that when their letters were answered they got contradictory instructions. I set to work to put my house in order and I can truthfully say that the last six months, have not been an easy time for me nor I think for the staff of my Department.
Headquarters.I found that the Headquarters Staff was organised in ten divisions each reporting to the Secretary and through him to myself as Minister. There was an accumulation of detail at the top which could and should have been dealt with lower i down in the machine, but the intermediate staff did not exist. I re-arranged the work into five divisions each under a responsible head, and I strengthened the inter-mediate staff, bringing in many experienced administrative officers. I found that there were no proper statistics and no sufficient progress reports to enable the output to be properly measured and checked. I appointed a Statistical Officer and an officer in charge of office organisation. Delays can now be traced to their causes and steps have been taken to remove the causes by simplifying the pro-cedure. In order to cope with the additional work due to demobilisation of the Army, the staff had to be largely increased and the difficulties were accentuated by lack of suitable accommodation. The staff at the 30th June numbered 14,829, of whom 11,549 are women and 3,280 are men. Of the 3,280 men 81 per cent, or 2,670 are discharged officers or men. The staff is housed in 33 separate buildings or groups of buildings and this separation makes control difficult and leads to great extrava-gance in staff.Local War Pensions Committees.At the same time that the work at Headquarters was being co-ordinated, regulations had to be issued under the War Pensions Act passed last year governing the procedure of Local War Pensions Committees and defining the duties of the Secre-tary, Treasurer and Chief Officer of the Local War Pensions Committees.The Committee is aware of the very valuable local work done by the L.W.P.C.&apos;s which act as the Ministry&apos;s local agents in direct touch with the claimants for pensions and allowances. The change, however, from war to peace affected these Committees many voluntary workers with great experience felt that the work they had done during the war should now be taken over by full time paid workers. The appointment of principal officers of these L.W.P.C.&apos;s and the necessary re-arrangements of areas so as to secure economic units for adminis-tration hod to be referred to Headquarters. There are 2,200 of these Local Committees and Sub-Com-mittees and the constitution of each of them has had to be reviewed. Congestion and delays at the centre were, therefore, hot surprising.Decentralisation.I felt that no re-organisation of Headquarters would be sufficient so I appointed a Committee under the Parliamentary Secretory consisting of Members of Parliament and representatives of Local War Pensions Committees to consider how far it would be advisable to decentralise the organi-satioo. The question was very carefully considered by that Committee, to which I am most grateful.They reported unanimously in favour of decentrali-v sation and they drew up a scheme which I have adopted. The scheme provides for setting up a number of Regions, either 13 or 11, each as a com- ^ plete self-contained administrative unit under a Regional Director advised by a Regional Advisory . Committee. While I shall retain the direction of policy all matters of administration arising within the Region will be finally settled at the Regional Office. The L.W.P.C.&apos;s within the Region will communicate direct with the Region ^ and all Medical Boards and arrangements for medical treat-ment will be dealt with by the Regional Medical Officer. Awards will also be made by the Regional Awarding Officer, at first the renewals only, but afterwards all the cases which arise locally will be settled locally. I am satisfied that only by a wide delegation of powers to the Regional Director is it possible to remove delays and ensure speedy de-cisions on the many local questions which arise, in&apos; the awarding of pensions and in the administration through the local committees.Regions in Operation.The Scottish, Irish, and Welsh Regions have already been established in Edinburgh, Dublin, Belfast, and Cardiff, respectively, and the S.E. of England Region has started in London. It is still for consideration whether two other Regions shall not be joined with this Region or whether the original proposal of 13 Regions shall be carried out. I hope the N.W. Region will be inaugurated next week at Manchester, and I shall proceed with the other Regions as rapidly as possible.Awards op Pensions.As I have said the recasting of the Headquarters and local organisation had to be carried out at a time of great pressure due to demobilisation of the Army, and if the Committee will allow me I will give them some idea of what this pressure was and of the steps taken to meet it. Let me first deal with the awards of pensions to men. Before demobilisa-tion commenced men were discharged from Military Hospitals and their discharge documents were sent direct to Chelsea and were awarded upon the fairly complete records then furnished. At Chelsea there was in existence a very laborious system, costly in staff, slow but fairly sure in action. During the last six months about 149,000 first awards have been made in cases of men discharged from hospital in addition to 274,035 renewals of previous pen-sions. This was the normal work of the Division. But with demobilisation two other classes of claimants appeared, viz., the Z. men and the Art. 9 cases.Z. Cases.As the Committee is aware nearly 3,000,000 men were demobilised in the first six months of this year. Before being demobilised all men other than those in hospital passed through Dispersal Stations and were given an opportunity of making a claini.
319Those who made a claim were examined either by the medical officer of their unit or by some other Army doctor. About 385,000 men made claims. The claim was made on Z. 22 and it, with the man&apos;s papers from the Eecord Offices was sent to the Ministry, so that pension might be granted. These are the men we call Z. claimants. But in addition there were others who for some reason or another, some because they feared that claiming would delay their demobilisation and others because they were then well did not make claims.. They are not debarred from claiming, they can still claim under Art. 9. These we call Art. 9 cases. In January last, I found that provision had not been made to deal with the claims of the Z. men, so I established the Z. branch as an emergency branch to deal with these cases only.384,867 Claims Received.It was organised and directed by Mr. Demetriadi, a business man of great ability, and but for his un-tiring efforts and for the excellent work of the staff under his direction, there would have been very serious delay m dealing with the 384,867 claims received. All through February and March the arrears increased, but by April the Branch was dealing with more claims than it received and arrears were reduced; by the middle of June arrears had disappeared. The greatest number of awards made in any one week was 35,858, a really remark-able performance, when it is remembered that each claim requires separate and detailed investigation and a decision on the merits. Of the 384,867, 303,464 claims were admitted and awards made of pensions, allowances and gratuities, and 81,403 were rejected.Article 9 Cases.With regard to the Art. 9 cases, the L.W.P.C.&apos;s have been authorised upon the report of the Local Medical Referee to make full advances pending the decision whether the claim is admitted to pension or not. There is still delay in these Art. 9 cases and a special enquiry is now being conducted to simplify and hasten the procedure. I may add that the experience gaine1 in dealing with the Z. cases has convinced me that much greater simplicity can be introduced into the Chelsea procedure and I am having the matter thoroughly examined so that an improved system may be introduced when the awarding is due in the Region.Widows and Dependants.I ought to say a few words about the widows&apos; and dependants&apos; pensions and allowances about which I have had most complaints. In November last the flat rate pension of 5s. for parents of unmarried sons who enlisted before the age of 26, necessitated a review of all then existing parents&apos; pensions of under that amount. In December last public notices were issued calling attention to the three classes of pensions to any one of which parents might be entitled.   The result was a great number24525of applications and a mountain of correspondence. The arrangements to deal with the inflow were hopelessly inadequate. Large arrears soon piled up and there were, very naturally, many complaints. The matter has been taken in hand vigorously; there are capable men now in charge and within a few months, I hope that the causes of delay will be-removed.Six Months&apos; Awards.I do not wish to offer excuses, but I think the Committee should realise that in addition to a con-tinuous process of reorganization the Ministry has had to deal with the very heavy work thrown upon it by demobilisation and that the task has been one of some magnitude. I can summarise the work of the- Awards Branches for the last six months by saying that during that period 920,439 awards have been made and 94,000 claims for pensions have been rejected or have run out by effluxion of time. The Committee should remember that each case has to be investigated and decided on its merits. Men&apos;s cases alone amount to about 6,500 awards each working dav.Appeals.I shall have more to say presently about the policy of appeals against refusals of pension, but I had better, perhaps, tell the Committee something about the present Appeal Tribunals. In the early part of the year, I found that the complaints of delay in settling appeals against refusals to grant pensions were in fact justified. There were cases pending since 1917 and many more which had been unsettled for a year. The two officials in charge of the section dealing with these appeals have both left the Ministry and the section has been com-pletely reorganised its output has increased and will-, I hope, still further improve, but until decentrali-sation &apos;is completed, the ideal will not be reached. In January last there were two Appeal! Tribunals hearing appeals. Now 15 have been constituted and arrears are being overtaken, but even yet I am not satisfied that many more Tribunals will not be required.Officers.Before I went to the Ministry I had heard many complaints that officers were not getting their pen-sions, so as soon as I became Minister I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to take the chair of a small ; Inter-Departmental Committee with repre-sentatives of the War Office and the Pensions Ministry to consider the position. This is only one of the many instances of the great assistance I have had from the Parliamentary Secretary. The whole-position was reviewed and much useful work done.. The Committee recommended that the officer should be kept by the War Office on pay until his papers-were transferred to the Ministry of Pensions to enable his pension claim to be awarded. 31 observe that the Select Committee have made the same recommendation. The War Office were not able to accept this suggestion.   So I adopted the next besta 2; &apos;
plan. I obtained authority from the Treasury to make advances to officers in necessitous cases pend-ing adjudication of pension. Some 7,400 advances have been made to cover the time necessary t to obtain the officers&apos; papers or to have a Medical Board. The Committee reported also that in view of the large number of officers to be demobilised the staff of the Officers&apos; Branch was inadequate; it then consisted of 85; it has been increased and now numbers 430 and is capable of dealing with the present intake of cases. Indeed pension is now awarded within 21 days of the receipt of the officers&apos; papers. In the last six months 41,932 cases have been dealt with, including the advances I have mentioned.Officers&apos; Friend.I appointed also a distinguished soldier to act as &quot; Officers&apos; Friend.&quot; He and his staff of 12 officers have had interviews and correspondence with over 10,000 officers and their relatives and he calls atten-tion every week to any cases of delays which come to his knowledge.He is applied to not merely in pension cases but on every conceivable question, and he knows the rules and regulations of other Government Depart-ments and he gives information accordingly. . In addition, I have published a small booklet giving clearly what officers are entitled to and there really is no excuse for an officer not getting his full due.Additions to Officers&apos; Pensions.In the early part of the year, I also set up a small Committee under my Parliamentary Private Secretary, the M.P. for Altrincham, to whom lam much indebted for his strenuous work during the last six months. This Committee considered the &quot; Officer&apos;s Warrant,&quot; as the officers had been omitted from many of the concessions made to men. For example, no bonus was payable on officers&apos; pen-sions, and there was no provision for a separation allowance for his wife when the officer was in hospital. These and many other anomalies have now been removed. A bonus of 20 per cent, is pay-able on the part of retired pay which is granted for service disability thus the minimum retired pay is now  210 instead of  175. A separation allow-ance is also payable of  50 to a wife or  40 to a dependant if the officer is in hospital. Children&apos;s allowances were formerly only granted if the officer&apos;s disablement amounted to 50 per cent, or more; this limit has been removed. Medical treat-ment can now be given to an officer pending settlement of his claim to pension. Artificial limbs and repairs are now supplied by the State. Pre-war disability retired pay is brought up to the current rate. Widows&apos; pensions granted in respect of previous wars have been increased to the rates of this war. These are very substantial advantages, and together they remove many grievances. I have already announced these alterations, but as they do not seem to be known, I have thought right to again give them publicity.New Increase.There is, however, a new concession, and a very valuable one, I wish to refer to briefly. As the Committee knows, there is a temporary bonus of 20 per cent, added to officers&apos; retired pay and to the pensions of officers&apos; widows. This bonus will now be added to the retired pay and pensions and cease to be a temporary bonus. The retired pay and pen-sions will thus be increased, and after three years&apos; if the cost of living falls, it will be subject to auto-matic reductions in the same way as men&apos;s pensions which I will presently explain. But for the next three years the increased retired pay and pensions will be payable.Medical Services.I now wish to deal, as briefly as possible^ with the Medical Services Division of the Ministry. I have been fortunate in securing as Chief Medical Officer Colonel Webb. During the war he held an important position in the Medical Service of the War Office, and he brings a very special knowledge of the requirements of the serving man who is now,a pen-sioner to the service of the pensioners. The work of this division is probably the most important of any of the divisions of the Ministry. It deals with that primary necessity.,of the disabled man, namely, the provision of medical treatment, both in hospitals and clinics and convalescent centres. When the bulk of the men were in the Army, the Army did the work, but demobilisation has transferred the necessity for providing hospitals and clinics from the War Office to the Ministry of Pensions.Hospitals.We have already taken over from the War Office two hospitals, and arrangements are practically com-plete for the transfer of others.The Red Cross are assisting the Pensions Ministry, as they assisted the War Office, and I have to acknowledge their kindness in offering us the use of some of their hospitals and providing for the con-veyance of cot cases by means of their ambulances.Nursing Servtce.As we take over hospitals, we are bound to provide a Nursing Service, and I am glad to say that Queen Alexandra has graciously consented to be President of the Pensions Nursing Service.I have been fortunate to secure as Matron in Chief Miss M. E. Davies, R.R.C., who will be assisted by an Advisory Committee.Convalescent Centres.I am also hoping to have ready very shortly certain convalescent centres at Blackpool, Epsom, and else-where, in which men who, while suffering from disabilities which require more or less prolonged out-patient treatment, will be able to employ their time to their own advantage by receiving preliminary training to fit them for their after life.I have been impressed by the large number of out-patients attending hospitals for, perhaps, half-an-
320hour &apos;a day, upon whose hands time hangs heavily. I believe that if such men as these are admitted to convalescent centres, they will, while receiving treat-ment, be capable of much useful training during their convalescent stage, and more rapidly benefit by the industrial training thereafter given them under the Ministry of Labour.Moreover, experience shows that many men, attracted no doubt by the high wages, and the demand for labour during the latter stages of the war, who went into industrial life, are likely to break down and require more or less prolonged convalescent treatment. For these also the convalescent centres are likely to prove of great use.Medical Boards.Until recently, the boarding of the men applying for pensions and the re-boarding of men on renewal of pensions was performed by the Ministry of National Service, but on the 1st of April last the Central and regional staff of the Ministry of National Service was transferred to the Ministry of Pensions, and we became directly responsible for the boarding of all men. On the 4th August we are taking over from the War Office the re-survey board-ing of officers. To give the Committee some idea of the extent of the increase of the work of medical boards, I may inform them that 229,697&quot; men were examined by medical boards in the six months ending June last. There has been a steady and rapid increase in the number of men boarded, owing to demobilisation, and in June last 45,UU0 men were boarded.Medical Appeal Boards.The Committee may be aware that under the system hitherto prevailing, the medical officers at the headquarters of the Ministry reviewed the decisions of these Boards and a medical officer was authorised to alter the amount of a man&apos;s assessment by a Board without himself re-examining the man. Many corn-plaints of this system have been brought to my notice, and the Select Committee has recently called special attention to this system, and has recommended that any case of doubt should be sent for re-hearing by the same or by a second Board, who in every case should examine the man in person.I entirely agree with this recommendation. In-deed, I informed the Select Committee, when I gave evidence before it, that I intended to alter the system as soon&apos; as the decentralised Regions were set up. While it was probably impossible to arrange for Appeal Boards before the Ministry of Pensions had its own medical personnel available to sit on Boards and specialists, both surgical and medical, at its hospitals and clinics to constitute the Boards, it will be possible to set up the Appeal Boards as soon as the medical personnel in the Regions has been com-pleted.,? Thereafter, a definite procedure will be laid down, which will be followed in all cases, namely, that if the Medical Assessor, on scrutinising thereport of the Board, is not satisfied that substantial justice has been done either to the pensioner or to thetaxpaye&apos;r, he is not to alter the assessment, but he is to refer the case either to the same Board or to an Appeal Medical Board for a re-examination of the man, and, similarly, if the pensioner himself is not satisfied. that his degree of disability has been correctly assessed, that is to say, if he is not satisfied with the amount of his pension, he will have the right to himself appeal to a Medical Appeal Board, whose decision in the case has to be treated as final, subject to this proviso, which is in the man&apos;s interest, that if he gets seriously worse during the period for which the assessment has been made, he may go to a Medical Referee, who may give him temporarily a higher allowance pending the reconsideration of his case by the Board.This arrangement of Appeal Boards, while I believe absolutely necessary in the interests of-justice, and to give the pensioner a reasonable assurance that his case is properly considered, will entail a large increase in the medical personnel, which can only be supplied if not only the perma-nent medical staff of the Region is available for Boards, but also the specialists attached to the hospitals and clinics, and probably, in some cases, the medical referees. There are some other aspects of the medical service which I must briefly touch upon.Artificial Limbs.The first is the provision of artificial limbs. Soon after I became Minister I wanted to be satisfied that the provision of artificial limbs for both officers and men was sufficient, and that the best limbs were being supplied.&apos; I accordingly set up a very strong Committee, upon which several Members of the House kindly served, and they have recently reported. On the whole, their report shows that the position is satisfactory. They have made several recommendations, which are in the course of being carried out. Perhaps the most important is that an expert Committee should be set up to revise all the various forms of artificial limbs at present made, with a view to standardisation, by selecting the best, from each limb. In future there will be constant requirements for the repair of limbs, and repair will be greatly facilitated if every maker can repair every limb. I might say, in this connection, that it is proposed that fitting centres shall be established in connection with orthopaedic hospitals spread through-out the country and that, in addition, repair depots shall be opened in populous centres, so that minor repairs can be made in a short time. I have also referred to the Committee the extent to which fibre pylons should be supplied and used by men with artificial limbs. I fancy that fibre pylons will take their place alongside artificial limbs much as a slipper does, to a boot, and that a niai\ with an artificial limb coming home from his daily occupa-tion will be glad to change it for a light fibre pylon. However, that is primarily a surgical question, and I have therefore referred it to the surgeons for advice.
Tuberculosis.I was also not satisfied that the provi^io^ made for the pensioner suffering from tuberculosis was sufficient, and in agreement with the Minister of Health we appointed a Joint Committee for the purpose of thoroughly investigating this question. The Joint Committee has now reported and imme-diate consideration will be given to the report.The Blind and Paralysed.I cannot close without thanking Sir Arthur Pear-son for his continued service for the blind; nor can I omit to mention the splendid work being done in many parts of the country by those who are pro-viding and managing hospitals and homes for the paralysed and the disabled requiring long-continued treatment. I feel very conscious that I have given but the. briefest sketch of the work done by the Medical Division of the Ministry of Pensions; it is a subject which alone would provide material for a speech, much longer than I can ask the Com-mittee to listen to.British Pensioners in the Dominions.I propose now to deal with some matters of policy. I will first deal with the question of the discharged disabled man who was resident in one of the British Dominions or in the United States at the outbreak of war. Many thousands of these men rushed for-ward and joined the Imperial Forces. Many desire to return to the country of their adoption.As at present arranged a man may return to Canada with a pension granted on the British scale which is lower than the Canadian scale, and thus he will appear to have suffered because he joined the Imperial Forces.The widows of men who were killed are even at a greater disadvantage; the British pension rates are much below the rates payable to Canadian widows and are insufficient to enable the widow to- live in Canada.I think it would be a reproach to th.&apos;j country if this disparity were allowed to continue.The case may well happen that one sister married to a Canadian who joined the Canadian Forces may be receiving a widow&apos;s pension of 38.s. 4d. a week, while her sister married to a Canadian who joined the Imperial Forces will have a much lower pen-sion.I am glad to say the British Government is now in negotiation with the Canadian Government and if, as I hope, these negotiations can be carried through successfully pre-war British residents in Canada and the United States who enlisted in the Imperial Forces, ; or Reservists who joined from these countries will be given the option of taking pensions and allowances, medical treatment and training and all other privileges at the rates and upon-flie same terms as are provided by the Canadian Orders in Council, instead of the rates of pensions accorded under the Royal Warrants. On the same principle I shall endeavour to negotiate with other self-governing Dominions that pre-war British resident&apos;; in those Dominions shall be given the option of taking their pensions from the Dominions instead of from Great Britain. This will of course add to the expense, as Great Britain will have to refund to the Dominions the cost of the pensions, but it seems to me that this will remove what otherwise might be a great scandal&apos; harmful to the best interests of the Empire.Report op Select Committee.I now propose to deal with the report of the Select Committee and to inform the House of the decision of the Government upon the recommendations made. The report was only published yesterday, but the Cabinet recognised the .urgency of the matter and have given it consideration at two meet-ings, so wherever else delay may be complained it. cannot be said that the Government have delayed in.&apos; coming to a decision upon this important matter.I think it will be better to take the report para-graph by paragraph and deal with each of the recom-mendations. In paragraph 4 I am grateful to the-Committee for their handsome recognition of my endeavours. This paragraph contains the three-main suggestions:  First, that there should be a special inspection and inquiry department.Secondly, that the services of discharged and; &apos; disabled .men should be utilised and special arrangements should be made with a view to ; training them, and .    v ;:: \Thirdly, that there should be better co-opera-tion between the various Government Depart-inents dealing with discharged officers and men, and that officers and men should remain on full pay until the necessary papers have been passed, to the Ministry of Pensions.       &quot;: First, let me deal with the proposed special inspec-tion or inquiry department.   Already a part of this-suggestion has been in operation for several months-past.Complaints Section.Owing to the large number of complaints received,, both from Members of Parliament and from else-where, I set up a Complaints Section, and each one of the complaints received is investigated and a record kept of how long each takes before a proper-solution is arrived at. ,    .The Committee&apos;s recommendation goes further. It suggests that any case not dealt with within a prescribed time should be automatically reported to-the Department and inquired into.   This is a very good suggestion, but, in order to carry it out, it is-essential that there should be proper progress reports-from each branch of the Ministry.   I have already said that I have recently appointed a statistical officer whose duty it is to see,that such progress-reports and statistics are forthcoming, and as soon as this is complete it will be possible to work along&apos; the lines recommended by the Committee.
321The Government is prepared to accept the recom-mendation of the Committee that the Appeal Tri-tribunals shall be set up under an authority inde-pendent of the Ministry of Pensions, and I am authorised to say that a Bill will be introduced as soon as possible to empower the Lord Chancellor to set up Appeal Tribunals and to make the necessary regulations in respect to the procedure.   The Tn-tribunals will consist of one legal representative either a barrister or solicitor who will be Chairman of the Tribunal and a disabled officer in officers&apos; cases and a disabled man in men&apos;s cases with a duly qualified medical practitioner.   Any refusal on the part of the Ministry to a claim for pension on the ground that the disability is not attributable to or aggra-vated by Military Service or is clue to serious negligence-gence or misconduct of the claimant will be subject to appeal by the claimant to this independent Tri-bunal.   Similarly a widow or a motherless child whose claim to pension is rejected on the ground that the death of the officer or man was not due to Military Service will be subject to appeal.   In this way there will be granted a statutory right to assert a claim to pension and a statutory court, inde-penclent entirely of the Ministry will be the sole and final judge of whether the right exists in a parti-cular case.I am aware that this does not entirely coincide with the Committee&apos;s recommendation.   The Com-mittee seems to suggest that there will be some magic if the words &quot; legally entitled &quot; were in-serted in an Act of Parliament, but they take care to say that they do not wish the scales of pensions and still less the administrative machinery of pen-sions to be embodied in the legislation.    They appear to have in mind that there should be inserted a clause under which a man should be declared to be legally entitled to such pension as may from time to time be settled by a Warrant or an Order in Council.   I do not believe that this would give any man any greater security than he will have under his statutory right to appeal to an independent Tribunal if pension is refused by the Ministry of Pensions and though I shall be perfectly willing to-consider any form of words which would strengthen the statutory right to pension I do not think that the suggestion of the Committee would have that effect.Appeals on Amount of Pension.Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the &apos;Report deal with another aspect of appeals and in effect it is proposed that a man should lutve a right to appeal against a decision by the Medical Board as to the amount of&apos; his pension and they indicate the constitution which they recommend for an Appeal Tribunal on amounts. It is suggested that there should be a lay ex-service element on the Tribunal, but as the assessment questions are mainly medical questions the medical element should have a majority, and they adAase that this medical element should comprise senior surgeons and specialists in the diseases or in-juries causing the disabilities under consideration.Employment of Discharged Officers and Men.With, regard to utilising the services of ^ discharged and disabled men and providing for their training, I have already laid it down that all of the neAV appointments of chief officers to the Local War Pen-sions Committees are to be made from discharged officers and men, and for many months past I have refused to sanction any new appointments except of discharged officers and men.   In order that a supply should be available, in May last I set up in the Ministry a school for teaching disabled officers and men the work of Local War Pensions Committees. I have had through this school 85 officers and men, who have been trained or are in process of training, and 28 of these are about to be appointed to posts. The Committee will realise that care must be taken to keep the numbers under training within the probable number of vacancies.   It Avould be a poor recompense if men were trained and posts were not available.   The Local Committees have been urged by circular to keep us informed of any vacancies about to occur, so that they may be filled from officers. and men trained at the school.   As the Committee is aware, I have no power to insist upon all the employees of the Local War Pensions Committees being limited to this class.   I have only power over the appointment of the principal officers, and indeed it would not be possible, so long as I have to rely on the Local War Pensions Committees,&apos; for me to interfere with the appointments they make of their lower staff. - After all, they are responsible for local administration, and they must have a reasonable latitude in the appointments they make.   I hope, however, the recommendation made by the Select Committee and the statement I am now making will call the attention of the Local War Pensions Com-mittees to the desirability of employing discharged officers and men to the fullest possible extent.&apos; Co-operation between Government Departments.The next point is the better co-operation between Government Departments, and the keeping on full pay of officers and men until the complete papers are received. I made this latter suggestion to the War Office many months ago, but it was not found possible to adopt it. I will, however, strengthened by the Committee&apos;s report, again bring the matter to the attention of the War Office end see whether some such arrangement as the Committee suggest cannot be carried out.Statutory Right and Independent Tribunals.The next important recommendation of the Com-mittee is in paragraph 6, namely, the statutory right to pension and in paragraph 8 of the right to appeal on entitlement, and the recommendation that separate Tribunals under the Home Office or some other Department of State should be set up independent of the Ministry of Pensions. I will deal with these two questions together as the one is intimately connected with the other.
8VI must say at once that this recommendation appears to me to be entirely impracticable. Let the Committee for a moment consider the work of the last six months. During this six months 920,439&apos; awards have been made, or, if I deduct from this total awards to widows, children, and dependents, nearly 700,000 awards have been made either for the first time or on renewal to men. These awards are made for varying periods for from 6 to 12 months. When the man comes up for a fresh Board and a fresh assessment of pension, what the Report suggests is that each one of these men should have the right to go before an independent Appeal Tribunal and should be able to appeal against the medical assess-ment. The Select Committee recognises i that an appeal would be ,of no use unless/the medical men upon the Appeal Tribunal were more authoritative than the medical men who made the original assess-ment. I do not know what proportion of the men the Select Committee thinks would appeal, but if even 1 in 10 appeal we should have something like 70,000 appeals in six months, and the delays would be so-great that the appeals could not be heard before the pension had expired. Moreover, it would be impossible to get the authoritative consultants and specialists in sufficient numbers to form the Appeal Tribunals. I do not believe that a reform is possible upon these lines.Medical Appeal Boaeds.I do, however, agree that it is quite wrong for any medical assessor who has not seen a man to alter an assessment made by a Board who has seen the man, and I have already told the Committee that as soon as the Regional Organisation is complete Medical Appeal Boards will be set up, to which either the man or the Department can appeal in the event of the assessment being challenged. I ask the Committee to believe me that this is the practical way of curing the evil which the Select Committee has pointed out. Any outside Tribunal dealing with these assessments would cause so much delay as to actually deprive the&apos; man of the benefits which the Select Committee desires him to obtain.Lieut.-Colonel Ashley: Why an independent Tribunal more than a Tribunal connected with my right hon. Friend&apos;s Department?Sir L. Worthington Evans : It is not a Tribunal connected with my Department. &apos; There will be Medical Boards all over the country in the regions. In each region there will be Appeal Medical Boards, which will consist partly of, the permanent staff, partly of the staffs of the hospitals and clinics, and, if necessary, medical referees. But it is a totally different class of Tribunal from that which the Select Committee suggested.Sir -Montague Barlow: I have been unable to grasp-really the difference. To my mind the crucial thing is this: Does the man have a free right of choice ? He has a free right of choice under the pro-posals of the Select Committee. As I understand it, under the Ministers proposal he is to have a free right to appeal when the regional area system isworked out. If that is so, I cannot see why under our suggestion there would be any more difficulty from the point of view of numbers of appeals in working out the system than under the Committee&apos;s system. , ?Sir L. Worthington Evans : Our Appeal Boards will be constituted of doctors partly in full-time ser-vice and partly stationed and in charge of hospitals and clinics all over the country. They will be carry-ing on their work at the hospitals and clinics when they are not wanted for a Board, but they are always available at any time for a Board. I cannot see how you are going to get consulting specialists, physicians and surgeons to hold office at the beck and call of any independent Tribunals to serve as the appeals come along. I am advised that it would be quite impos-sible to get the medical personnel available for the purpose.Increases op Pensions.I now cornel to paragraphs 9 to 19 of the Select Com-mittee&apos;s report, which deal with their recommenda-tions for increases in the flat rate pension scales and for alteration in the basis of alternative pensions. I agree with the Select Committee that we cannot use-fully consider the amount of flat rate pension with-out taking into account at the same time the Alterna-tive Pension.Flat Rate and Alternative Pensions.The theory of both flat-rate pension and alterna-tive pension is the same. The flat-rate pension is intended to compensate the majority, namely, those whose earnings were normal, and the alternative pension is intended for those whose earnings were exceptional, and who therefore had been accus-accustomed to a standard of living beyond the normal. I accept the general theory and the reasoning by which the Select Committee arrived at its results, and I agree that it is most desirable to place the scale iof pensions and its adjustments from time to time upon a simple and easilv understood basis.Automatic Scale op Pensions.The Select Committee has based its recommenda-tions for an increase as a consequence of and in connection with the rise in cost of the working class budget as estimated by the Board of Trade. The Select Committee recommends that the Board of Trade figures should be adopted as a definite standard for assessing automatically the rise or fall of pension, and indicates the manner in which the rise or fall of pension, and indicates the manner in which the rise or fall can be gauged. I have only one observation to make upon this part of the recom-niendations.The Select Committee proposes that any increase made should hold good until March, 1921, when the first re-adjustment should take place. ,1 think this period is too short; our object should be to give a sense of security to pensioners. I do not want them to have at the back of their minds that in a comparatively short period the amount of their pen-
322sions may be again re-adjusted. The Government is therefore prepared to go further than the Select Committee proposes in this connection, and to say that the increases shall be for a period of three years, and that the automatic re-adjustment shall take place as to 20 per cent, of the pension after three years. The Committee will understand that while I accept the proposal of the Select Com-mittee for an automatic re-adjustment, I do not pledge myself to the exact words of the report. The formula will have to be settled in the new Warrant.Increase in Men&apos;s Pensions.Now let me come to amounts and let me take the man&apos;s pension first. The Government is prepared to accept the new scale proposed, that is to say, the new flat-rate pension for a totally, disabled man will be as follows:  A single man, 40s., which represents a rise of 7s. A married man, 505., which represents a rise of 17s. iA married man with one child, 57s. Qd., which represents a rise of 16s. Qd.A married man with two children^ 63s. Qd., which represents a rise of 16s. Qd.A married man with three children, 69s. Qd., which represents a rise of 17s. Qd.With 6s. for each subsequent child. The scale for the partially disabled will. be a percentage of the full scale according to the per-centage of his disability.There are, however, certain reactions from this increase which will have to be considered and about which I pm not in a position to make a final state-ment to-day. For example, a single man in lodg-ings away from home for treatment or training has frequently obtained, besides his present pension, an allowance of 7s. 6d. a week towards his board and lodging. He will now have  2 a week out of which he will be able to maintain himself. Similarly a married man under treatment and training at home in certain cases obtained an extra allowance up to 7s. 6d. a week. As he and his wife will now have 50s. instead of the previous 33s., this extra allow-ance should, I think, be discontinued. There are also certain treatment allowances for men in institu-tions, and wives&apos; separation allowances and constant attendance allowances, which may have to be re-considered.I do not wish to do more than indicate that as the substantive pension is being largely increased the allowances which were intended to make up for the previous inadequacy of the pension in certain cases will have to be reconsidered.Increase in Widows&apos; Pensions.Now let me deal with the proposals as regards widows. The existing rate of widows&apos; pension is 13s. 9d. under the Barnes Warrant, or, with the 20 per cent, bonus, 16s. Qd. for widows under 45, with an additional Is. Qd. for widows over 45. The Government is prepared to accept the Committee&apos;srecommendations. The new scale will therefore be, in the case of a widow under the age of 40 without children, 20s. a week, and in the case of a widow of any age with children or over 40 without children the pension 26s. 8d. a week. There will be paid in addi-tion in respect of the first child 10s., in respect of the second child 7s. Qd., and subsequent children 6s.Alternative Pensions.With regard to the Alternative Pensions, there is no doubt that Alternative Pensions for men under the existing methods of assessment have completely broken down. As I told the Select Committee in the evidence I gave before it in May last, the reason is that the pension is assessed by taking into account the earning capacity of the pensioner at the present rate of wages and comparing it with his actual earn-ings at the old rate of wages prevailing before the war. The effect of these comparisons is to prevent almost everyone, except those totally incapacitated and without any earning capacity, from obtaining an alternative pension. Those who are capable of earning receive wages at present rates frequently higher, notwithstanding their incapacity, than the wages they earned before the war, and yet the wages they now receive do not enable them to maintain the same relative standard of living as they did before the war. In my evidence before the Select Com-mittee I put before them two proposals for meeting this position, and one of those proposals has been adopted by the Committee, namely, to load up the pre-war wages by 60 per cent, in order to get at figures which could be fairly compared with existing wages.Maximum Increased.The Government is prepared to adopt the recom-mendations of the Committee, and in assessing claims for Alternative pensions in future the pre-war wages will be loaded by 60 per cent., so that a man who was in fact earning 50s. a week before the war will be deemed to have been earning 80s. a week, and his present earning capacity will then be compared with the 80s. and not the 50s. The Government&apos;is also prepared to vary the basis of assessment by allowing the full pre-war earnings increased by 60 per cent, up&apos; to 100s. a week to be taken, into calculation, so that the maximum Alternative Pension will be  5 a week instead of the present  4 10s. This will undoubtedly mean a great increase in the number of Alternative Pensions, and will entail very heavy work upon the Local War Pensions Committees and upon the Department. I think it necessary, however, to carry out the original intentions which lead to the adoption of the system of Alternative Pensions.Increase in Widows&apos; Alternative Pensions.With regard to widows&apos; Alternative Pensions the same principles will apply. The pre-war earnings of the husband will be loaded up by 60 per cent., and the maximum of the widows&apos; Alternative Pension will be  3 6s. 8d. a week instead of the present maximum of  3.   The Select Committee have also
made two minor recommendations in paragraph 17 of their Report. The Government is prepared to accept the first of these recommendations, namely, that a widow with children who at first goes on the flat-rate should have the option to take an Alternative , Pension as her children cease to be entitled to children&apos;s allowances, but in order to obtain this right she will have to make an application and prove her right to Alternative Pension within a year. The second recommendation is of less importance; it requires some further consideration and I will not deal with it to-day. It will be understood that the automatic sliding scale will apply to alternative pensions as well as to the flat-rate pensions. , The Select Committee also call attention to anomalies in the schedule to the Warrant, and this matter shall receive attention.Maximum Pension during Training and Treatment.There is only one other recommendation in the Select Committee&apos;s report which I have not dealt with, and that is the recommendation that the prin-ciple of increasing the pension to the maximum for men undergoing treatment and training should be adhered to. This has been a good plan in the past, and we propose to continue it.Date of Increases.The Committee will realise that these alterations will throw considerable additional work upon the Department. Many preparations have to be made before so large a change can be brought into opera-tion. It is not an easy thing to change the amounts of pensions and allowances payable to a million people.&apos; The new rates will therefore be brought into operation in respect of the first week ending after the first September next. This gives about a month to make the necessary perparations, and so it is not probable that the increased payment will actually be made on that date, but any arrears whioh may accrue will be paid as from that date.I do not wish to invite a deluge of correspondence, so that I give notice to all concerned that it is quite unnecessary to write to the Ministry or to the Local War Pensions Committees claiming the increases; the increases will bo made automatically. With re-gard to alternative pensions, however, claims will have to be made by the claimants to the Local War Pensions Committees, and they will be adjudicated as rapidly as possible. It must, however, be many months before the large number of persons newly entitled. can receive settlement of their claims. Meanwhile they will draw their pensions at the flat rate, and all arrears which may be due to them will be settled as from September.Thanks to Select Committee.I should like to thank the Select Committee on behalf of the, Government for the great care they have given to the matters referred to them, and for the painstaking way in which they have conducted a most difficult enquiry. &apos; I am sure that every member of the House will feel indebted to them for their able report. I regret that I have detained the Committee so long. My excuse must be the importance of the subject, and the desirability of letting everyone, including the pensioners them-selves, know that every effort is being made not merely to do justice to the disabled by adequate pensions, but also by improvement in and quicker working of the administrative machinery. In the course of the debate which followed Major Cohen said he was satisfied that the limb-less man was getting his first artificial leg quickly,, and that there were few men who had not already got one. As regards renewal and repair, the position was not at all satisfactory. He doubted whether it was right that the Secretary of a Local War Pensions Committee, who in a great many cases was a woman,, and usually someone with less knowledge of artificial limbs than the pensioner himself, should have the responsibility of certifying that the case was one for a special fitting hospital. He also called attention to the delay which took place before a man could get into a fitting hospital. He suggested that the French system&apos;, should be adopted and that the country should be divided into various centres, each with its own hospital, to which men who needed repairs to their artificial limbs could be sent, and in which the repairs would be quickly done.Mr. J&quot;. M.&apos; Hogge said the Pensions Department had gained enormously by the administrative ability of its new head. Since&apos; the present Minister took office, the complaints reaching him (Mr, Hogge) had altered from 75 per cent, on pensions and .25&apos; per cent, on Military Service matters to 75 per cent, on Mili-tary Service matters and only 25 per cent, on pen-sions. On the question of the right to appeal on amount of the pension, he was doubtful- whether a satisfactory decision had been reached. He noticed that a proposal had been made to allow an appeal on amount when a pension became permanent. Was that an alternative suggestion ?Sir L. Worthington,Evans said he had not closed his mind on that matter, but at present it was absolutely impossible to have the Appeal Tribunal on amount as suggested by the Select Committee.Mr. Hogge said everyone who touched the subject knew the difficulty of putting these things into opera-tion. He suggested that the Minister should address his ingenuity to the position of the average pen-sioner, who felt very acutely that when he reached a certain figure it would shortly be going doAvn a little bit, and again down a little bit. This was one of the greatest troubles. He associated himself with those who expressed thanks and gratitude to the Government for the very generous way in which they had responded to the Select Committee&apos;s Report.Sir Montague Barlow, speaking as Chairman of the Select Committee, paid a tribute to the ability and energy of the Minister of Pensions, and said he was grateful that the Government had accepted with-out reservation. the recommendations of the Com-rnittee.   He referred to the work of. the Local War
323Pensions Committees, saying that in the great towns these Committees had done admirable service under great stress, and very often without very much recog-nition. There were, however, very many Local War Pensions Committees throughout the country which were not very efficiently worked, and some of them, he Avas afraid, were really bad. He hoped the Minister Avould put his powers under the Act of .1918 into force. He Avelcomed the decision of the Goyern-ment in accepting the Committee&apos;? recommendations, particularly with regard to the allowance to the married Avoman and the increase of the AvidoAv&apos;s pen-sion. He Avas pleased that the principle of the sliding scale had been accepted, but if it Avas to be an actuality the figures relied upon must secure general acceptance, and must be prepared on some plan Avhich was Avell advertised and easily understood.With regard to Appeals on amount, the difficulty about the Ministers plan was this., The man would get the satisfaction of a second hearing, but he A\&apos;ould not have the same amount of confidence in the aAArard resulting from the second hearing as he would have if the award could have been secured by an independent tribunal.They Avould be foolish to make suggestions which-would break down the machinery if carried out, but he hoped that under the regional system of adminis-tration a loophole would be kept open for the con-stitution of proper Appeal Tribunals on amount, of the type suggested in the Committee&apos;s report.  -He urged the development of Sanatoria and improved, accommodation, and the institution of training Colonies and Village Settlements for the proper treatment of Tuberculosis, and he hoped the proposals of the Committee on.this matter would receive the kindly consideration of the Government.Captain Hacking impressed upon the Govern-ment that they should admit the Statutory right to a pension. He thought the increase of pension would give perfect satisfaction to the majority of discharged sailors and soldiers.Me. John Hodge said the Minister of Pensions was to be congratulated upon the success he had achieved with the Treasury. With respect to the new Regional scheme, he hoped it might be suCcess-ful in getting rid of many of the delays which had occurred in the past. It had to be borne in mind, hoAvever, that the Pensions Ministry was a new department created during the War period with an absolute untrained staff of women. He wished to express his great personal delight at. the very generous advance that had been made in the amount of the pensions.Captain Loseby asked the Minister to reconsider the question of appeal on amount.Lieut.-Colonel Ashley referred to the difficul-ties which the previous ministers, Mr. Hodge and Mr. Barnes, had had to face,. and he thought that the present Minister of Pensions would be the first to acknowledge the good Avork of his predecessors. He was glad that the present Minister Avas able to put the top storey on the edifice which they had erected.   He was profoundly grateful to the Gov-ernment and Sir Laming Worthington Evans for the generous and prompt manner in. which the demands of the ex-service man had been met.Major Entavistle wished to see the question of entitlement sAvept aAvay, and urged that in the case of any man who had been accepted by the Army authorities at least in the A.I. Class, any injury received or disease contracted during his Military service should be deemed to have been caused or aggravated by that service. He hoped the Pensions Minister Avould use all his influence to bring to an end the intolerable delays which occurred at the War Office in sending fonvard a man&apos;s pension papers. The Pensions Minister got a good deal of the opprobrium that should rightly, be placed at the door of the War Office. .Mil. Lvle said that many Medical Boards looked upon their jobs more or less in the same way as a big Insurance Company doctor looked upon his job. The point of vieAv of the insurance doctor aaras to see Iioav little he could give the man. Doctors were just as humane as anyone else, but they had got it into their heads that if there Avas a doubt, the benefit of the doubt must not go to the man, but must go to the other side.Mr. P. C. Thomson held that once Medical Authorities passed a man into the Army as fit, it should be held that they had got a fit man. He thought the Government, in accepting the recom-mendations of the Committee, had done one of the best day&apos;s work they had ever clone for the great bulk of the population of the country.Mr, W. Graham said that if the Regional Districts were going to be efficient, they would have to depend to a large extent on the efficiency of the unit the Local War Pensions Committee. He suggested that it would be worth while to instruct the workers, paid and voluntary, in the regulations and the whole range of duties they had to under-take. He pressed most strongly upon the Ministry the consideration that the time had come Avhen within the machinery of the War Pensions regula-tions they must establish a compassionate depart-ment of the Ministry, or a department under another name, in which hard cases not coming Avithin the regulations could be considered. He suggested that a unified policy be agreed upon with the Pension Authorities of the Dominions to ensure that dependants not provided for under one set of regulations should be provided for under another.Sir J. Butcher, as a member of the Select Com-mittee, thanked the Government and the Minister for having so promptly and sympathetically adopted nearly all the Committee&apos;s recoinmenda-tions. He hoped the Government would reconsider their decision on the subject of statutory right., Mr. G.  Jones maintained that the statutory right to pension ought to be considered.Lieut.-Colonel Willoughby expressed the hope that the Pensions Minister Avould be able to attend to the old soldiers who had finished their period in the Army before the War and who had rejoined
though suffering from certain infirmities, and who were refused pensions because their infirmities were said to have been contracted before the War.Dr. D. M-urray urged that the question of entitlement should be settled once for all on the basis that if a man had been taken into the Army and had fought for his country, and was physically fit when he entered, anything that happened to him subsequently should be regarded as due to his Military service. The present position was illogical and unscientific, and might without difficulty be accounted an injustice. One -of the most cruel duties placed on Medical Boards was that they should be asked to say whether a certain disease was caused by or had been aggravated by service in the War.Mr. J. W. Wilson congratulated the Pensions Minister on the quickening up of his Department and improved administration.Sir Laming Wortiiington Evans, in reply, said that it was the desire of the Ministry to enable a man as soon as possible to know what his future was in regard to pension. Referring to the complaint that in country districts provision for continued treatment for men was not sufficient, he said that a system had been established, and before long he hoped to have the country properly covered. He expressed his extreme gratitude for the extraordinary chorus of praise that he had had the pleasure of listening to.He promised to consider the matter of speedier and easier methods of providing for repairs to artificial limbs.The two main points which had been raised were statutory right as to pension and appeal as to amount. He believed that.by giving the statutory right to appeal and by setting up a Statutory Court, they had recognised that the men were legally entitled to a pension, but lie was prepared to consider any words which would strengthen their position. The diffi-culty about telling a man the amount of his pension at the first Board was that the assessment might be altered by a Chelsea doctor.As soon as the decentralisation was complete and the Appeal Medical Boards were working the man would be told at the first Board what his degree of dis-ablement was, and he would be given an opportunity if he chose of appealing to the Appeal Medical Board. As to appeal on amount, he asked the Com-mittee to believe that if this were done the Pensions Administration would break down. If during the last six months one man in ten had appealed, there would have been 70,000 appeals, and not 10,000 of them would have been yet settled. Thus 60,000 men would now be waiting and would not be getting their pensions. When they came to permanent pensions, that which was going to determine a man&apos;s future, -the case was totally different. When they got there he did not want to close the door, but if they pressed this matter now they would paralyse the machine and harm the man. If later on they could so improve the machinery that it became possible, he would be the first to welcome an appeal also on amount. He promised to consider all the suggestions that had been made, and again expressed his thanks to the Com-mittee for their reception of the Pensions Estimates.The Vote was agreed to.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;8 Stationery Office By DARLING and SON, Limited, Baooh Stbeet, E.2;

325oiiSPECIAL REPORT.The Select Committee appointed to enquire and report upon the past method of Administering the PENSIONS ACTS AND WARRANTS, and what steps, if any, are necessary tor the removal and prevention of legitimate grievances, have agreed to the following Special Report :-1. The Committee was constituted as follows: Sir Montague Barlow, Mr. Betterton, Sir John Butcher, Captain Coote, Major Entwistle, Sir Frederick Hall, Sir Henry Harris, Captain Loseby, Mr. Pennefather, Captain Redmond, Mr. Reid, Mr. Frederick Roberts, Mr. John Taylor, Mr. Stephen Walsh, Mr. Charles White; and elected Sir Montague Barlow as Chairman.2. The Committee have held thirty-six sittings and have heard a large amount of evidence comprising evidence from ; The Pensions Ministry, including the Minister himself and his Parliamentary Private Secretary (Major Hamilton, M.P.), the Secretary to the Ministry (Sir A. Flynn), and the heads of various departments in the Ministry;. The Chairman of the Special Grants Committee;Representatives of Local War Pension Committees and of the Association of Local War Pension Committees;The Disabled Officers Fund, the Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, the Association of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, the Silver Badge Party, and other associations of discharged ex-Service officers and men;Representatives of the Ministry of Labour and of the War Office, Board of Agriculture, and Board of Education;Mr. Hogge, M.P., Major Barker, M.P., Col. Yate, M.P., Brig.-Gen. Sir Hill Child, M.P., Commander Hilton Young, M.P., and other Members of Parliament;The Government Actuary, Sir Alfred Watson;Sir Douglas Haig, and many others.3. The Committee have been unable to conclude the hearing of all the necessary evidence, but in view of the urgency of the problem have agreed to the following Special Report on matters on which the evidence has been substantially concluded.DELAYS.4. Serious and long-continued delays have undoubtedly occurred in the past, both at head- Lister quarters and in Local War Pension Committees administration.   Evidence shows that there has q. 2357, been improvement recently in this respect, certainly at headquarters, and particularly since the Passmore, present Pensions Minister took office, and indeed over the whole field of Pensions the. energy and mVs&quot;^ Wood administrative ability of the present Minister are securing great improvements.  But evidence from q. 4327.   .&apos; very many different quarters shows that both in the case of officers and men, and also centrally Tiddair,   -and locally, preventable delays are   still much too common, producing exasperation and si&apos;ajef8&apos;discontent. .... Q-505&apos;5-The new system of devolution into thirteen regional areas, now being worked out by the Beatson, Pensions Minister, will, we hope, bring the machinery of administration nearer to the man and so %JIIt&apos; prevent delays in administration both at headquarters and locally.  The success of the Regional Q. 7^20. Scheme will largely depend on the Regional Directors.  Every effort must be made to secure for Shakespear, these posts men of the higheso capacity and experience, Hore29&apos;But we wish to emphasise the need of improvement in this matter of delay in many branches Q. 9S6i. of Pensions Administration, both central and local. Peei,Q. 3316,At headquarters we welcome the recent creation of a Department of Office Organization at n8^^&apos; the Ministry, under a Director General of Organization.    This new Department will we hope greatly improve the working and administration of the various Departments.    In  this connection we suggest a system might well be tried which is practised in many large business offices, viz., that a Special Inspection or Inquiry Department should be set up, and. that all cases unsettled (or undealt with, so far as circumstances permit) within a fixed time (which might vary according to the Department or class of case) should automatically go to this Enquiry Department, whose duty it,would be at once to find the cause of the delay and, if necessary, to punish the defaulter.   In the case of local administration, while many Local War Pension Committees, especially in the large centres, have done admirable work, evidence shows that the work of many of the smaller Committees is not well done, and many seem insufficiently staffed. For insufficient staffing there is no excuse, as all the expense of the L.W.P. Committee administration is now borne from Central Funds.   Where defective staffing is known to.exist, steps should be taken to put in force the powers given to the Minister by the Act of 1918 to stimulate, and, if necessary, to compel, the local Committee to act.Adequate use must be made in Administration, both central and local, of the services of discharged and disabled men, and special arrangements should be made Avith a view to training
Flynn, Q. 122. Bloxam, Q. 8228.Sir Douglas Haig, Q. 8409. Mrs. Wood, Q. 4359. Hore, Q. 9356.Lister, Q. 2152.such men for work of this character. In the case of Local War Pensions Committees themselves the representation of discharged and disabled mon should be materially increased. Hore App.        Evidence put before us by the Pension Ministry shows that in the cases of seven typical local No. 2.    War Pension Committees, out of 836 male employees only 259 were discharged officers, N.C.O.&apos;s or men.   While if the total number of employees (including women) be taken viz., 1,127 thegroportion of discharged officers and men employed becomes even more unsatisfactory. The kmimittee recommend that much greater effort should be made to secure the employment of discharged, and when possible of disabled, officers and men for work of this character, in which their own personal experience and disability should make them peculiarly useful and sympathetic.Evidence shows that delays in assessing pension are often due not so much to the Pensions Ministry as to the Admiralty and to the War Office, as the necessary papers are slow in coming through from the naval and military to the Pension Authorities. It is imperative that better co-operation should exist between the various Government Departments dealing with discharged officers, men, and dependants and their pensions. Evidence from the Pension Ministry shows that the delay on the part of the Army authorities, both the War Office and the Record Office, is often very serious, and the assessment is consequently delayed weeks or, even months. We are strongly of opinion, in order to prevent hiatus in pensions and also with a view to secure active co-operation on the part of the Naval and Military authorities, that both officers and men should remain on full pay and chargeable to the War Office or Admiralty respectively, at any rate till all necessary papers have been passed to the Pensions Ministry.5. Apart from the general administrative question of delay, the urgent points we desire to deal with in this special report are three: I. The Statutory Right to Pension. - II. Medical Boards, and the right of appeal.III. The Flat Rate pension, including that of widows; and the alternative pension; viz., the Scales and their relation to one another.6. I.- Statutory Right to Pension. This involves two different ideas, which are often confused:(a) The constitutional question whether the payment of pension should depend on royal Warrant, and be expressed to be a matter of bounty; or should (as in the case of Sailors&apos; Pensions under the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions Act of 1865, sec. 3) be based on Act of Parliament.This may seem a small point and one of sentiment; but evidence shows that the present method of expressing payment of pension to be by way of bounty is really felt as a grievance. It is desirable, therefore, to pass for Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s pensions an act similar to the Naval Act of 1865, now in force for seamen, basing the payment of Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Pensions on Act of Parliament, and, further, declaring the Soldier and Airman, and also the Sailor, to be &quot; legally entitled &quot; to his pension, as was the case under Windham&apos;s Act of 1806, till that was repealed in 1826. If this provision becomes part ot the Statute Law of the land, there could be no possible question as to the legal claim of the pensioner to his pension when properly ascertained, and the pensioner would have under the Act power in the last resort to enforce his claim by mandamus or other wise. But the scales, and still more the administrative machinery of pensions, should not be embodied in legislation, otherwise amendment and adaptation become cumbersome and slow, and require an Act of Parliament in each case. Scales and machinery of administration must be left to be settled by Regulation or by Order in Council or similar executive machinery; but such Regulation or Order should be made subject to, and draw its authority from, the Act itself.(b) The right to sue for and recover the pension in the County and Higher Courts.The arguments against the delay and cost involved in sending disabled men to the County Court, with the consequent appeals, are in our view very strong. Provided proper Pension Appeal Tribunals are set up we do not think, as stated below, that resort to the ordinary Courts would be necessary in any but very exceptional cases; and we believe the proper procedure to be that independent Pension Appeal Courts should be constituted, allowing not only, as at present, appeal on entitlement but also on amount in every case.7. II. Medical Boards and the Right of Appeal.Two or three special grounds of complaint relating to Medical Boards have been put before us by a considerable number of witnesses: (a) Unsatisfactory assessment of Disability in the Z eases. These are cases of men who were not in hospital, but on demobilisation claimed to be disabled owing to service, and therefore to be pensionable. We were informed that it was found impossible, owing to the speed at which demobilisation had to be effected, the vast numbers to be dealt with, and the limited number of doctors available, to set up the usual Boards of three, or more doctors; and the examination and assessment had to be carried out by one medical man, generally speaking the medical officer of the unit. Many of these medical officers probably had little, if any, experience in such work before the Armistice; and there seems to have been some delay in issuing full directions to the medical officers of units as to the methods on which assessments of disability should be conducted. Subject to this criticism, we doubt if, under the circum-stances, and in view of the urgent demand&apos; of the Army and the nation for the speediest / demobilisation possible, any better means could have been devised of dealing with the problems. Sanger, The celerity with which the Z cases generally have been dealt with when they came throughQ. 3002. to Chelsea reflects credit on the Department concerned.SirL.Worthington Evans, Q. 1761.

326Q. 1602.rapid system has helped to get rid of difficulties.Demobilisation is now proceeding at a much slower rate, and we recommend that if Major possible Boards of three medical men should be constituted in the ordinary way to deal with q&quot;^&apos; Z cases on demobilisation; and further, both for the purposes of investigation into the health of . &apos; the nation, and also Avith a view to possible claims under Article 9 of the Warrant, that every worthingfcon&apos; man on leaving the Army, whether making a claim for disability or not, should have a full Evans, and careful medical examination, the results of which should be placed on record. This is done Q:.6[0-for the Navy, and it is most desirable it should-be done also for the Army and Royal Air Force, q1^.(b) Revision of the award of the Board which has seen the man by officials or medical menat Chelsea who have not seen him. Evidence shows that such revision of the award of the Sir A. Flynn, original Board is never made at Chelsea by lay officials, but only by competent medical men; J* ^ pi ^ and also that in only a very small proportion of cases is the original award reduced; in a much qui30. ynn&apos; larger number of cases the result cf the examination of the original award by the Chelsea Q. 205 a seq. doctors is to raise the original award, not to lower it.But allowing for all that, the system by which the award of a Board which has seen the Sir L. i man is liable to revision by medical men who have not seen him is indefensible, and this is E^ginston now generally admitted.  All cases of doubt should be sent for a rehearing by the same or by q, \metseq a second Board, who in either case should re-examine the man in person; and he in his turn Flynn, Q. 165. should have the right of appeal in every case on amount as well as on entitlement, as explained below. /(c) Complaint has also been made that men when first boarded are not told at once what they are assessed at and entitled to; and, further, that when (as happens) these facts do leak out and become known to the man concerned, he sometimes finds that, after revision by Chelsea, the amount he eventually receives is different from that originally awarded him. Naturally this works both ways. The evidence is that the Chelsea revision has in the past Flynn, Q. 139. raised two awards for every one it lowered, and it is only those that are lowered that are complained of.  But we think that with the development of the regional system, and thegreater experience of the Medical Boards, and the increased uniformity that should result, that there should be no difficulty in telling the man directly the Medical Board have arrived at a decision what that decision is. The grant then made should become immediately operative; and not be liable to reduction by any administrative act, but only by decision of a further competent Board; the man should be informed that the award will hold good and that the pension be paid from date as then awarded (subject in the case of reboarding to the Ring paper working off), but that it will be subject to revision by subsequent Boards at longer or shorter periods. The awards of the Boards will presumably go to the new Regional Directors Head Office for inspection and checking as they now all go to Chelsea, and in case of what appears palpable error, either of too high or too low award, the case could be reboarded within a reasonable time.But the guiding principle here and indeed throughout Pension Administration should be See Second that the man should always be given the benefit of any doubt. SelecfcomIf the award were communicated to the man by the Board, and the amount promptly and mittee on definitely fixed in this way (till reboarding), we believe that much dissatisfaction would be National   ^ allayed.    &apos; &apos;  &apos; , . S^sTIn any event, if the award of the first Board were palpably wrong e.g., a man who has an(j g,pars lost only one eye were treated as 100 p.c. disabled the award should stand till the reboarding, and no attempt should be made to recover any excess payment. Generally both here and in all other similar cases we think that attempts to recover excess payment Avhere the original assessment, though possibly wrong, was made by a proper authority should be abandoned as unfair; it may be trie cause of much hardship to those who live by weekly payments and have usually little, if any, surplus savings out of which to refund arrears.8. Riyht of Appeal. Pension appeals fall into two classes: (a) Appeals on entitlement ie., on the question whether the disability is attributable to or aggravated by service (Art. 1 (i.) of the Warrant).(b) Appeals on the amount awarded.&apos;(a) Appeals on Entitlement. This work was originally undertaken by Judge Parry&apos;s Tribunal, which did effective work; but it was quite impossible for one Tribunal to cope with the vast number of appeal cases that arose, and great delay resulted. We are of opinion that the long and long-continued delay in the hearing of Pension Entitlement Cases in the past, often amounting to many months, was a serious defect in pension administration, and the delay in setting up additional Tribunals so as to deal with them was, in our view, inexcusable.This evil has now been dealt with, the Tribunals reconstituted, and their numbers largely increased. For this improvement credit is due to the present Pensions Minister. There are now, as recently rearranged, 10 such Tribunals; they are constituted as follows: (i.) A Lay President, usually with Legal Training, (ii.) A Representative Ex-Soldier and Ex-Sailor, (iii.) Medical Assessors.On Judge Parry&apos;s Tribunal the medical element were full members with equal voting, rights, and it is not easy to see why this plan is not followed on the new Tribunals.

Lister,it is not possible at present, on the short experience of their working, to say how far theso Appeal Tribunals on entitlement are successful. We have had no complaint with regard to them. But in our opinion it is essential they should be independent of the Pensions Ministry administration.They are said to be independent now; but they clearly owe their existence to the Minister, and could be altered or extinguished in the same way as they were set up viz., by his instructions.We recommend that they should be formally constituted as separate Tribunals, under the Home Office or some other Department of State, and we make this recommendation with all the more confidence as from the evidence of the Minister for Pensions we gather that he does not dissent from this proposal.(b) Appeal on Amount. At present there is no direct appeal on amount. It is true that if a disabled man is dissatisfied Avith the amount he is receiving he can always apply to his Local War Pensions Committee, and their Medical Referee may give him an increase Avhich will be payable till he is reboarded; but subject to this, that if the amount given by the Referee is not confirmed by the Board the excess is recoverable from the man. As already stated, we hold that in this and in other similar cases Avhere money has once been paid on the decision of a competent authority it is unfair to attempt to recover any portion of money so paid on the ground that there has been an official miscalculation or error m judgment.But apart from that, Ave consider this indirect method of appealing unsatisfactory, and one which imposes too great a responsibility on the Medical Referees.We recommend that a direct appeal on amount should be allowed in all cases to regularly constituted appeal Tribunals on the lines given below. Strong evidence has been put before us, not only from representatives- of the disabled men, but also from leading Pension Officials and from Local War Pensions Committees, that an appeal on amount is not only right in principle, but is also strongly desired by the men themselves. Evidence Avas given on behalf of the Association of Local War Pensions Committees that they did not &quot; think the men Avould be satisfied unless they felt they had had that appeal.&quot;  [Q. 7881.]The Pensions Minister in his evidence concurred in the principle of Appeal on Amount, but only after permanent pensions Avere fixed i.e., at present in only 10 per cent, of the cases  and he dissented from the proposal of appeal on amounts so long as pensions Avere only temporary. At the same time the scheme he outlined of Consultation Appeal Boards pointed in the same direction. If there are administrative difficulties these should be easier to surmount when the neAV regional system is introduced.The conditions Ave recommend for the constitution of the Appeal Tribunals on Amount are as follows:(i.) They should be set up on a basis independent of the Pensions Minister, e.g., under the authority of the Home Office, as in the case of Appeal Tribunals on Entitlement.(ii.) It is desirable to have a lay ex-Service element on these Tribunals as on the Entitlement Appeal Tribunals; but as the assessment questions are mainly medical questions, the medical element on Appeal Tribunals on Amount should in our view have a majority.(iii.) The medical element on the Appeal Tribunal should be of superior authority and experience to that of the ordinary medical Boards and should, Avhere possible, comprise Senior Consultants and Specialists in the diseases or injuries causing the disabilities under consideration.(iv.) The disabled man Avhen appealing must be informed that the result of his appeal may be to alter the assessment downwards as well as wpAvards.  An analogy is furnisned in the case of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal.. This provision should be a check on unnecessary appealing, If proper Pension Appeal Tribunals Avere constituted on these lines Ave believe theyAvould secure the confidence of the ex-Service men concerned and ,.that those Avho iioav desire a right ofJ202,^ im.^&apos; appeal to the Courts Avould be satisfied.9. III. Flat Rate Pension, in-dueling that of widows and the Alternative Pension; viz., the Scales, and their relation to one another.l This is the most important matter Ave have had to consider.  Our terms of reference point toWorthington amendment in matters of detail rather than to a complete revision of the Warrant and of the oV20S9 existing scales, but the evidence given by the Pensions Minister raised the broader issues and placed *&apos;  &apos; &apos;      on the Committee the responsibility of dealing Avith them.The bases of the alternative and flat rate pensions are similar.Both in the case of the flat rate and of the alternative Pension, the State provision is to be regarded as a compensation (though no monetary compensation can ever really be adequate) for physical disablement and not as a general reAvard for service. Otherwise every man Avho has served would be entitled to claim a pension,It is true that the pension includes not only allowance for economic disability but also for loss of amenity of life; but so far as economic disability is concerned (in the case of the Mat Rate Pension and to a somewhat less extent in the case of Alternative Pension) this is general disability
327in comparison with, and by reference to, industrial conditions as a whole, and not in reference to. the loss suffered by the individual disabled soldier,  For instance, the disability involved in the loss of an arm must, on the economic side, be measured generally.  Thus in the case of a violinist his disability is not measured by the value of his hand to him. *But though alike in general principle, there is this difference between the Flat Rate and the Alternative Pension. The Flat Rate was meant to apply to the unskilled and low skilled wage grades up to, say, 30s, to 40s. of pre-war wages; and the Alternative Pension to the more skilled and higher paid wage grades. There is, therefore, a direct financial and actuarial relation between the two, and not only nave the Flat Rate and the Alternative Pension a close financial relation to one another, but both are connected with the cost of living and the Expense Budget of the industrial classes from which the Army was mainly drawn. A provision by way of compensation for disability, which may have been accepted by the common sense of the country as not unreason-able in 1914, may Avell seem impossible now when &quot;prices are at least 100 per cent, above the pre-war level.For the purpose of ascertaining the price levels of the Avorking class Budget, ie.t the ordinary costs of a Avorking class household, including not only food, but general items, such as rent, Ave have had recourse to the official Summary published each month in the Board of Trade Gazette. - ,pwycolt is to be noted that throughout this portion of the Report we are dealing only Avith the case ofiN.C.O&apos;s. and men; that of the officers will be considered separately.10. It may be of use to give the pension scales and also the rises in prices in other countries.Evidence Avas given us as to the comparative maximum pension scales as 1&apos;oIIoavs:MEN-TOTAL DISABLEMENT.Canada -France  -Australia ItalyNeAv Zealand -United States -United Kingdomsingle men. 47/11 a week   -,37/-   ,,    ,,     -30/- ,, ;,   -19/4 ,, ,, 40/- , ,, 28/10 ,, &apos;,, 33/- (including bonus)men with wives. 47/11 plus 7/8 a Aveek. 37/- a Aveek. 30/- plus 15/- ,,    ., 19/4  ,,    4/5 ,, , ,, 40/-       20/-. 28/10 ,,   14/5 ,,    ,, 33/- (including bonus).See Hore, Memoran-dum in Appendix. Q. 9183, et seq.Hore, Q. 9209.N.B. Under the Alternative Pension a man may get up to 90/- a week (including bonus).No other country appears to have any provision similar to the Alternative Pension in this -country.   In Australia there is some poAver of adjusting pension to individual needs.   In America there is a scheme of Voluntary Insurance on a contributory basis of Avhich 95 per cent, of enlisted men seem to have availed themselves; and it therefore secures probably something in the way. of an alternative provision on Avhat is considered a liberal scale.On the other hand, it Avas put before us in evidence that under pre-Avar conditions the cost of living and the rates of Avages in the Dominions and the United States Avere considerably higher than in this country.  A comparison of the cost of living, including rent, sbws that in 1914 the index numbers of the relative cost in relation to the cost in the United Kingdom Avere . approximately as folioavs : Canada    -     - -     - .   -     -     -     -     -     -     -   150Australia -     - ...     - .     .     . 123NeAv Zealand    - -     -     -......124United States- - -    -     -......150United Kingdom.......-     - - 100But at the same time the cost of living has during the Avar risen to a far greater extent in the United Kingdom than in the other countries referred to. This may be largely due to temporary causes, and Ave had evidence that even noAv the cost of living is 23 per cent, higher in Canada and the United States than in this country. But though prices may eventually, in the course of some years, come dOAvn, it must always be borne in mind that the Avorking class house-hold has to be carried on in the meamvhile, and food, clothes and rent,paid for each Aveek.- 11. We feel strongly that it is most desirable, if possible, to place the whole question of the scale, and its adjustment from time to time, Avhether upwards or aWmvards, on a simple basis which will not only be easily understood but be accepted by all concerned as reasonable, and Avhich* It is laid doAvn in the instructions to Medical Boards, Paragraph 44, that: &quot;The basis of assessment should be the man&apos;s physical capacity as compared with that of the ordinary healthy man of the same age. It does not vary simply with his earning capacity, since pension is not merely a recompense for impaired power of earning a livelihood, but also a compensation for loss of the amenities of life. It may be that in the case of a man following a sedentary occupation the disability causes no loss of earning capacity, but he will have lost much otherwise, and his compensation must therefore be based on his comparison with a Avhole and sound man. It should be clearly understood that in no case should the man&apos;s pre-enlistment occupation be taken into consideration in the assessment of his disability,&quot;The basis of pension generally in other countries also is average loss of. earning or working Hore, oapacitv,  In terms of United States laAv, it is &apos; the loss of general earning capacity resulting from    9193-such injtories in civil occupation, and not wpon the impairment of earning capacity in each individual case!&apos;  It may be noted that in Australia the strictly proportionate assessment of disability may be modified by relation to the individual loss of earnings.
See Board of Trade Gazette.Belfast War Pensions .Committee, Mrs. Shakes-peare.Q. 7978.should, if possiblo, work almost automatically. For this purpose we think it desirable to make the official figures of the working class Budget as published in the Board of Trade Gazette the standard&apos; by which to measure variations in cost of living and the consequent adjustments lor pension. Only the monthly figures are at present available, but probably to get the best results these figures should be averaged over a longer period, e.g., six months or a year. These figures show an increase in the cost of living at the moment in price of something over 100 per cent, since-July, 1914. Taking the present, or Barnes Warrant of 1917 as the basis for Pension, the present rise in prices according to Board of Trade figures since 1917 is approximately 40 per cent. Bearing these facts in mind we make the following recommendations : 12. (1) Maximum Flat Rate Pension. That the Barnes Warrant be accepted as the basis, of calculation so far as Pension is concerned, the basis of prices to be the average of the Board of Trade figures as shewn by the Board of Trade Gazette in the. months prior to August, 1914. Prices measured by the nearest approximation available, viz., by comparison of the figures of April, 1917, with those of July, 1919, show a rise since the Barnes Warrant of about 40 per cent.; we think, therefore, the Flat Rate Pension which is already raised by 20 per cent. Bonus should be^ treated now as raised by 40 per cent., which in the case of the maximum disability pension would mean an increase from 27/6 (or with Bonus of 20 per cent. 33/-) to 38/6. In addition, if measured over an average period of months, it will probably be found that the variation. in prices between the present time and the spring of 1917 would on the Board of Trade figures be somewhat more than 40 per cent., and we therefore recommend that the 100 per cent, disability flat rate pension for the single man should be placed at 40/-.Pensions for men with 90 per cent., 80 per cent., and lower percentages of Disability should be raised in proportion. At the same time we have had it in evidence that the present scales in the Schedule to the Warrant are in many cases illogical, and we recommend that they should be-reconsidered. For example, the man Avho has lost two eyes&apos;is at present classed 100 per cent, disabled, and the man who has lost only one eye is classed as 50 per cent, disabled, which clearly does not represent a fair relation between the two cases.13. (2) Children^ and Other Allowances. These, subject to the provision recommended below for the married Avomen and for AvidoAvs, Avould be raised in the same proportion, viz., 40 per cent, above the Barnes&apos; Warrant or somewhat more. The comparative tables, therefore, Avould Avork out as follows: 	Barnes Warrant.	Present Scale, with 20 per cent. Bonus.	NeAV Scale.	s. d.	s. d.	s. d.1st Child	6  8	8  0	10  0*2nd Child    -	5  0	6  0	7  6Subsequent Children	4  2	5  0	6  0* The married woman as proposed below will take the place of the first child at 10s., and the first child would therefore, stand at 7s. 6d. and the second and subsequent children at 6s.14. (3) Special Married Women&apos;s Allowancc-lt has been given in evidence by many Ayitnesses. that a real hardship is involved in the maximum flat rate being the same for a married man without children, as for a single man, ie., 27s. 6d., or with present bonus 33s.We recommend a special allowance in every case for the married woman, as such, arrived at &quot;by substituting her in each case for the first child. The comparative scales will therefore be as follows: 	Present Flat Bate, with 20 per cent. Bonus.	New Scales.	Kise$.	s. d.  *	s. d. ,	s. d.Single man   -     -     -     -	33  0	40  0	7  married man ------	33  0	50  0	17  0,,.      and child -     -     -     -	41  0	57   6	16  6,,      and 2 children -	47 .0	63  6	16  6,,      and 3 children &apos;-	52  0    ,	69  6	17  6.,       and 4 children -	57  0	75  6	18  61 15. (4) Widows.-The present widow&apos;s flat rate of 13s. 9d. under the Barnes Warrantor with 20 per cent, bonus, 16s. 6d., is complained of by many witnesses as inadequate, especially in cases-Avhere there are children, and where it is therefore imperative that the widoAV should remain at home to. care for them and not go out to work.  We recommend that: (a) . Following the method adopted in the case of alternative pension the widow&apos;s. maximum flat rate be assessed at two-thirds (not one-half) of the men&apos;s, ie., 26s. 8d, if the man&apos;s maximum is 40s.  But
328(6) This is not to apply in the case of the widow without children below the age of 40. Until she attains 40 her allowance to be 20s., but at 40 to rise to the full two-thirds. The case of the widow without children and below 40 who is, in fact, unablo to work, may have to be met by a special grant administered through the local War Pensions Committee.16.. (5) Alternative Pension. In view ot the evidence given us as to the wage rates of the sirA. Watsons industrial classes of the community,from whom the national army was mainly drawn, and bearing Appendix, in mind the connection in principle between the Flat Rate and the Alternative Pension mentioned above, it appears that the true proportion of the alternative pension cases to flat rate cases .should be about 10 to 20 per cent, of the whole.The Pension Minister stated in his evidence that for men the alternative pension had broken gee qqs 2q38 -down, the reason being that a comparison is involved between pre-war earnings and present earning 2039, 2014. capacity, which two factors, owing to the rise in prices, are no longer comparable.  We are of -opinion that the best way to adjust the scale is by &quot; loading-up &quot; pre-war earnings.  The only See Worth-alternative suggested in the evidence was to take the present standard wage in various industries, ^Sjj0.0 Evans and assess the Alternative Pension at that figure, but then great difficulty will arise in cases where  -ster there is no standard wage, or where it varies in different districts. Q. 2219.On the basis of the Flat Rate Pension, and its connection in principle with the Alternative Pension as outlined above, the Government Actuary, Sir Alfred Watson, furnished evidence to show that the pre-war rates of earnings should be &quot; loaded up&quot; by 60 per cent., and we recommend that this course should be adopted. This would apply to both men&apos;s and widows&apos; alternative pensions.*17. (6) Widows&apos; Alternative Pension. In the case of Widows&apos; Alternative Pension, we recommend two further amendments: (a) The widow with children who at first goes on the Flat Rate should have the option to SirL. Worth-come on the Alternative Pension, if she desires it, as her children work off the Pension q8^&quot;^vans Scale.  But she should apply to do so within a limited time, so that the necessary evidence, may at once be obtained and placed on record.  Later on the evidencemight not be available.(b) The widow should be allowed Alternative Pension on the basis of two-thirds of her sir L. Worth-husband^ earnings whether, in fact, he would have been himself entitled to the ingtonEvans, Alternative Pension or not.  At present this is not so. 198&apos;7*Further, in the case of the men&apos;s alternative pensions there is at present the following maximum limit, viz., a man can receive pension on the basis of the total of his pre-war wages (after allowing for present earning capacity) up to 50/-, and half of any amount above that up to 100/-. In other words, apart from the present Bonus, the maximum alternative pension possible is 75/-. We recommend that this limitation of one-half, from 50/- to 100/-, be abolished, and that a man be granted Alternative Pension (after allowing for present earning capacity) to the full extent of his pre-war earnings (loaded up as already explained by 60 per cent.) up to 100/-, but not beyond. In the case of widows, the maximum in the same way would be the full two-thirds of the husband&apos;s pre-war earnings (also loaded up by 60 per cent.) up to 66/8, viz., two-thirds of 100/-. It is to be noted that we make recommendations below as to annual adjustments of the Flat Rate Pension based on the Board of Trade figures of the cost of living. We recommend that similar readjustments of the Alternative Pension scale be made.18. The Government Actuary laid a Memorandum before the Committee in which he estimated that the adoption of recommendations outlined above would involve additional annual expenditure of between  17,000,000 and  18,000,000.19. (7) Bonuses and on Automatic Sliding Scale. We think the principle of making additions to pensions by way of Bonus is unsatisfactory and causes irritation. A Bonus is granted for a temporary period, involving uncertainty when that period is drawing to an end as to whether the Bonus will be continued, and, if so, at what rate.The additions we have recommended above to the Flat Rate and Alternative Pensions are, therefore, not to be by way of Bonus. But, as we have already indicated, the increases are recom-mended in consequence of and in connection with the rise in the cost of the working-class Budget estimated by the Board of Trade, and we recommend that these figures should be adopted as a definite standard for assessing automatically the rise or fall of pension in the following way: In December of each year, the Board of Trade Gazette should publish officially figures of the rise or fall in prices in the working-class Budget averaged over the previous twelve months as compared with pre-war prices, also averaged over a period of months prior to August, 1914; that the consequent figure of rise and fall in Pension on the basis of the Barnes Warrant should be officially announced by the Pensions Minister not later than the last day of December in each year to take effect on all pensions and allowances on the 29th March following, and to continue in force for twelve months till the next annual readjustment.. But we recommend that this method of automatic adjustment should be subject to two qualifications: (a) If prices fall, the Flat Rate Pension now recommended should not in any case fall below the present rates under the Barnes Warrant with the 20 per cent, bonus, and these should be considered as a minimum.(b) No alteration in the scales ot pension should be made unless the Board of Trade figures showed a substantial variation, e.g., at least 5 per cent.* This would mean that if the pre-war earnings were calculated to be 50s. per week these earnings should now, for the purposes of the Alternative Pension, be taken as 80s. per week.        &apos;
The Committee recommend that the necessary adjustment should be made &quot;without delay arnP remain in force until the end of the financial year 1920-1921.  The first readjustment under these -recommendations would therefore be published in December, 1920, and come into force at the end of March 1921.20. (8) Treatment and Training Allowances. These have in the past been fixed at the maximum Disability rate, e.g., a man with 50 per cent, disability is entitled, under the Barnes warrant,.. to 13/9,. and now, with 20 per cent, bonus, to 16/6; but directly he goes on Treatment or Training his pension is raised to the maximum of 27/6, or with bonus, 33/-. There are also now allowances provided for wife and children in cases of Treatment and Training. Evidence has been given us that the inducements offered to men are not sufficient to ensure that as large a number as the witnesses hoped would undertake either Treatment or Training. We recommend that the principle of increasing the pension in all cases to the maximum for men undergoing Treatment or Training should be adhered to, and, in view of the large additions recommended above to the maximum Elat Rate Pension, we hope that a larger number of disabled men will be induced to undertake Treatment and Training.21. In view of the increases proposed above in the Flat Rate and Alternative Pensions and allowances for men, wives, children and widows, the provision tor parents and dependants also requires to be reconsidered. But on the question of these provisions and their adjustment we are calling further evidence, and shall embody recommendations in our Final Report. We are adopting a similar course with regard to the scales of allowances and pensions for officers and their widows.CONCLUSION,There are many important points on which we desire to hear further evidence e.g., past administration generally, the question of the Employment of Disabled men, the Amendments of the Officers&apos; Scales, the Adjustment of Dependants&apos; Allowances, &amp;c. as well as a good many smaller points of detail. We hope to conclude our evidence and to issue a final report on all these points at an early date.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;8 Stationery Office By WYliAN and SONS, Iimited, Fbiier Lanb, Lohdon, B.C. *..

In this he will have the sympathy of the country with him. . For elementary justice must desire that the men who took the war risks should not be forced to take more than their share of peace risks as welh   But to give fulfilment to the most con-crete of the Field-Marshal&apos;s suggestions an all-round increase in pensions-will require something more than sympathy and applause.   Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, the Minister of Pensions, in his evidence before the Committee, suggesting alterations, stated that the estimate for an increase in pensions to 40s. a week, and a corresponding increase in other pensions was some  20,000,000 a year.   The present Pensions Bill provides foran expenditure of  75,000,000. So to a very proper approval of Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s spirited advocacy the country will need to add a similar approval to pay such increase.One of the suggestions made by Sir Douglas Haig must have been a fait accompli.at the time of the FiekUMaf shal&apos;s appearance A Moving before the Select Committee, namely, Machine. an increase of pension earned in former wars. The Minister of Pen-sions made an announcement of this increase in the House of Commons on 3rd July. Another point on which the Field-Marshafs suggestion and the intention of the Pensions Ministry may be said to coincide is the appointment of Medical Appeal Boards, foreshadowed by the Minister of Pensions in his evidence, which, he stated, were to be installed so soon as the new regional organisations had come into operation. By this system no alteration in an assessment would be made except on the decision of a Medical Appeal Board.. So the machine which is admittedly clogged^-some-thing like 350,000 new pensions have been awarded owing to demobilisation-is being got to&apos; work on the right lines. Sir Douglas Haig says : , &quot;Laboriously no doubt, but too slowly.&quot; But when he admitted that &quot; matters have been in some degree improved,&quot; he may have had in mind the fifteen different alterations in the warrant which have been made within the last six months.Slowness, delay, was one of the most emphatic of the.Field-Marshals complaints.   While paying -:a tribute &quot; to the courtesy and sympathetic-An Old     thetic attitude of the present Ministry Indictment,   of Pensions&quot; and to the excellent work of the &quot;Officers Friend,&quot; in his indictment on the score of delay, he implicates the Ministry of Pensions along with the Air Ministry, the War Office and the Ministry of Labour.   It&quot; is an old indictment-earned no doubt by results but
not always deserved.   The Ministry of Pensions would, we imagine, admit it^ with qualifications which must be patent to all thinking men.   The hugeness of the organisation may be gauged by the size of the staff at headquarters:  14,500; and that staff is housed in forty-one different build-mgs  about  London.    Slowness  with such a machine seems inevitable. But delay to large num- -bers of men,  suffering very serious hardship&apos; because of it, seems heartless.   And not un-naturally. They think they are forgotten. Where is the remedy?   Decentralisation should do much for pensions; the recommendations of the Select Committee should do more when they come along.Mr. C. F. Hore, Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, in again giving evidence before the Select Committee detailed &amp; Continual  arrangements made in the past to . Combat.    combat this delay which was fore-seen.   Proposals were made to the War Office, similar to the suggestions of Sir Douglas Haig, that pay and allowances should be continued to officers until a pension was awarded.: when this could not be agreed by  the Army Council it chrystallised into ah advance of pensions. Further, Mr. Hore outlined new arrangements to include re-grouping of branches of the Minis-try; the appointment of a Director-General of Office Organisation; the institution, of a statistical branch. So the combat continues. Meanwhile the words of M. Clemenceau, as quoted by Col. Fred Hall, M.P.,. might be remembered-.&quot; You cannot get over the chaos caused by the -terrific upheaval of the past five years by the waving of a wand or a miracle.&quot;An indictment,  as decided as anything Sir Douglas Haig said about delay in various Minis-tries, was made by him about the Trade      &quot; hostility&quot; of Trades Unions towards Union      discharged disabled men.   He main-Hostility,    tained the definition, on question  &quot; hostility.&quot;   Similar complaints are to be heard from other sources.  A concrete form of this .&quot; hostility &quot; appears to be an objection by Trades Union Officials to admit a man as a member who is not considered to have had sufficient-iently long training, with the concurrent objection by members of Trades Unions to work with a non-union man.    We can conceive no legitimate argument in favour of this attitude that the exigencies of the present abnormal conditions should not override.  The men went out to fight; and the fortunes of war necessitate that they shall now take up a new means of livelihood.   They are confronted by what amounts to a veto; and this&apos; not by any soulless Ministry or Government Office, but by fellow workers.-Presumably there is fear of a depreciation in the rate of wages some odd form of self-preservationat the back of this idea. There must certainly be regulations as inelastic as any eman-The Old ating from Government Offices. The Ingratitude, cry a very proper cry for hiuman-ising the machine might well be applied to those Unions fortunately not all  which raise these technical barriers against the men 1 who have fought. If it was only officialdom it would not be such a sorry position ; but the &quot; other ranks&quot; are apparently just as pernickety in standing out for strict observance. They will not work with the man who is not a member. Never mind that he has suffered the filth, the dangers, the mutilation even of the trenches. No conces-sion can be made. The attitude is so indefensible that we can&apos; only imagine it is temporary-capable of adjustment. If not the workers are reinstituting, of their own action, the old ingratitude, the old slur of the days when a soldier in uniform found, it difficult to get served in a bar -because he was a soldier.A resolution, passed at a recent meeting of the Longton and-Fenton (Staffs),Branch of theNational Federation of Discharged Unfulfilled and Disabled Soldiers and Sailors, Promises,   suggests that the old trouble with employers has not yet passed away. The resolution protests against the treatment of ex-Service men by certain employers in refusing to re-engage them in their jobs. Speakers instanced cases where men had not been reinstated and had moreover been superseded by younger men. The Prime Ministers appeal is not so very old; but if it is already being ignored, it is time that some more effective means should be adopted. The voluntary system was abandoned, during the war when fighting men were required for the good of the country; if when they return to peace they find the promises as to reinstatement are not being ful-filled, the voluntary system for this re-employment might well be abandoned for the good of the menWe print elsewhere a significant article on cure by suggestion of &quot; shell shock&quot; and kindred functional disorders.

Though the tax on those administer-ing such treatment must be great indeed, the rewards must surely be commensurate; and judging from the sentiments expressed in the article, these rewards are fully appreciated by those who are privileged to achieve them. We think the article will be of interest to our readers. It cannot, of course, apply to all cases; but we trust that it may carry a message of hope to. some who have never heard about the method.

PILKINGTON.The hand-pegged rug is an article which is to The newer machine is an adaptation of the be found in almost every kitchen in the northern automatic principle to the same machine. The counties of England.   In its simplest form it   needle working automatically, opens as it comesthrough the canvas, is fed with the material and returns. From the point of view of the disabled man this constitutes a great advance, as a one-armed man can operate, this machine and equal and even better the out-put of a two-armed man working a hand machine.By agreement with the inventors, the Y.M.C.A. have secured the sole use of this machine and have started a workshop for disabled men on co-opera-tive lines. The initial capital for the purchase of the machinery and material is advanced by the Y.M.C.A., and all profits will go first to establishing a sinking and development fund and then, as soon as the whole or part of the capital is paid off and the industry is on a sound basis, will be shared among the workers.Various kinds of ma-terial are used; but it is found that superfine felt cuttings are the most suit-able in every way, asconsists of small pieces of waste material thrust through a length of canvas.Until recently the mak-ing of these rugs has been a &quot; home &quot; industry. The invention of a machine which greatly increases the output of each worker has made it possible to develop the industry on factory lines in the inter-estsof the disabled man. . The machines at present in use at the Y.M.C.A. Disabled Soldiers&apos; Work-shops are the invention of two brothers, one of whom is himself a dis-charged soldier.The first machine is operated by hand and can be used without serious handicap, by men suffering from such disabled-bilities as the loss of one or both legs, stomach wounds and severe shell-shock. The work is light and requires no great skill or prolonged train-ing. The worker simply sits at the machine and thrusts a needle through a length of canvas whichis stretched on rollers. As the needle is thrust this material is easier to work and produces a through the canvas with the right hand it is better and lighter article. Unfortunately the opened by means of a small lever and fed by the supply of this material is uncertain.&apos; Help in over-left hand with a piece of cloth and then drawn coming this difficulty will go a long way towards back.

The design is determined by the number of congenial, work for considerable numbers of pieces of each colour inserted in each row. disabled men.Working the Automatic Mat Machine.The cost of repairs and renewals (due to fair wear and tear) of artificial limbs for disabled officers is already borne by the State. The Ministry of Pensions now announces that it has been decided to make similar arrangements in respect of surgical appliances, other than artificial limbs. The serving officer will continue to bear the cost of repairs and renewals of artificial limbs and appliances until he is retired, but on his retire-ment the Ministry of Pensions will undertake such cost.Information has reached us to the effect that there arestill vacancies for training men in Agricultural Basket-making in the workshops at Earith Bridge, which is under the supervision of the Huntingdon War Pensions Committee.It should be noted that applications for free passages for repatriation of wives and families by officers and other members of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will not be considered unless they are received by 31st August. Free passages cannot be granted to those who embarked for the United Kingdom after November 26th, 1918.

CURE AND SLEEP BY SUGGESTION.BY A MEMBER OF THE LANCASTER CLINIC.The fine work that Seale Hayne Hospital has done- to dispel functional paralysis after many months of disuse, must not be allowed to obscure the less dramatic uses of psychotherapy, namely, the part it can play in those disorders of the nerves which are loosely spoken of as &quot; shell shock and neurasthenia.&quot; For, though it is a big thing to give a man back the use of his limbs, he will be just as grateful to obtain release from sleepless-ness and nervous anxiety, even though it may take considerably longer; So, following the article in the last issue of the &quot; Gazette,&quot; it may be useful to describe in simple and non-scientific terms what psychotherapy can do, and has done, in this direc-tion, with special reference to the clinic at 80, Lancaster Gate, W.The Lancaster Clinic was opened in the latter part of 1917, and was the first institute of its sort in the United Kingdom. Not that psychotherapy is a new science though indeed it has made rapid, strides in the last few years but up to that date admission to a hospital had to be sought when special treatment was desired. But it was wisely recognised by the Ministry of Pensions that, while hospital is certainly the only place for the severest cases, the man suffering from a moderate degree of nervous instability is likely to be distressed and upset by a return to military surroundings; whereas with a clinic where all are out-patients, he can live at home and continue employment under the supervision of doctors with special skill and experi-ence in this particular work. From the first the success of the scheme was apparent; and it is not too much to say that there are to-day hundreds of men in London who owe the restoration of their health and happiness to the institute overlooking Hyde Park.When the editor asked for some account of the method of treatment, it appeared difficult to give an adequate description of so wide a subject as psychotherapy. It is as though, having comforted a friend after some great sorrow, one were required to say how it-had been done. Sympathy might be: spoken of. Or worldly wisdom, or a knowledge of psychology; but- it would be felt that words meant very little, and that, after all, the great thing was that the friend was helped to regain his peace of mind. And the psychotherapist feels some such difficulty in giving a general account of his pro-procedures. Nor in this case is it of any avail to describe the institute itself. For it is merely a large house with consulting rooms, each contain-ing, at most times in the day, one doctor and one patient!But the essence of the matter is that each patient is-taught something of the facts of his condition, such knowledge being the first step on the road to recovery.   In all the nervous disorders which are called functional, it has gradually come to be recog-nised that the mind plays a part which is all-important, and when peace of mind is attained, nature steps in and the nervous trouble, whatever particular form it takes, tends to disappear. In the rush of war when hospitals were overflowing, it was unavoidable that for the most part reliance had to be placed on physical means of recovery; for to help the mind to become resettled is not a short nor easy business. And so it is found that many have lost hope of a reasonably quick recovery. But until a man can realise the truth  that &quot; functional&quot; means .&quot; curable,&quot; and that in spite of the failure of physical treatment psycho-logical methods will prevail, it will be very difficult to help him.The writer recently saw a man who in three years had gone a very little way towards health and had come to regard himself as incurable. He had neglected no means which occurred to him, but had purchased electrical belts, tonics and patent foods, and had given up smoking with little or no result. He came up to the clinic confident that all had been done in vain. However, after a few. visits it ap-appeared that these various activities concealed the anxious belief that, because he was different to his old self, he was therefore going mad. He confessed that he often dreamt of madness and used to test himself in various ways to see if - his mental powers were going. It did not need long to convince him that his fears were unfounded; and when once his mind was set at rest, the cure Commenced, and in -a few weeks he had quite recovered. Countless examples might be given of such ignorance leading to a fixed anxiety which quite precludes a return to health until it has been removed.The patient is shown at the clinic the necessity of talking over his war memories. Nine men out of ten have tried to do the exact opposite&apos; of this to &quot;forget about the war.&quot; It may be possible to forget the facts as they happened and to erase them as so much history, but the emotions remain behind and find their expression in dreams and in vague fears and forebodings. Fortunately it is easy to demonstrate the importance of this re-discovering the past; for with nearly every case the practice of devoting half an hour each day talking over old battles will produce a really astonishing difference in a few weeks. It is very unusual to find that war dreams can long survive such treatment;A striking example of the value of this procedure occurred in the early days of the clinic, when one of the severest cases of depression that we have seen came up. Indeed, so profoundly ill was the man -that his friends were anxious for him to be sent into an asylum since they could do nothing with him. For some time little could be got frpm him, but-after a few sessions he wrote down how -he was
wounded, but it was not till the sixth visit that he described a German atrocity that he had wit-nessed in the retreat from Mons. He and a comrade had come to a Belgium farm, when a little girl in age and appearance reminding him of a child of his own whose death had occurred some years previously ran out and warned them of the approach of the Uhlans. Some of the enemy soon came up and a German struck at the little girl, killing her as he believed and he drove his bayonet through the man&apos;s head.In narrating the story he became wildly ex-cited, his speech becoming more intelligible, till at the end he cried out &quot; My God, that&apos;s what has driven me mad.&quot; After this his speech became quite normal and within a month he was com-pletely recovered.Such remarkable examples do not occur frequently, of course; but when they do occur they demonstrate very forcibly how essential it is to recall the incidents of war. In even the slightest cases, when perhaps no more is complained of than lack of concentration or loss of confidence, the regular recital of the past brings an improvement which will compensate for the effort made. To most men it is an effort in the early stages of treatment.To restore. sleep without the use of drugs is another important achievement. It is possible to do a great deal by what is called treatment by suggestion. Now anyone who has suffered from sleeplessness will realise how little use it is to try to influence sleep by any exercise of the will. Indeed, the anxious waiting for the moment when sleep arrives is the worst possible attitude for securing it. Sleep is a function of what is called the sub-conscious part of the human mind; and it is only when the sub-conscious is harassed and anxious, for whatever cause, that the individual begins to think about it and will himself , to sleep. This is &quot;where treatment by suggestion can help. If the patient can fix his attention on some bright object, such as a light or a coin, he can as it were divert the conscious mind. Quiet remarks made to him in this condition suggesting perfect sleep free from dreams, with absolute relaxation of mind and body induce the sub-con-consious mind to recapture the old habit of sleep. It is generally found that after a few treatments calm and easy sleep is assured.It is really quite astonishing what progress can be made if a patient does his part to concentrate his mind vigorously. There is no question of mystery about the matter at all; merely it is found that this simplest of experiments will gener-ally give the most restful sleep in the most obstinate cases. The same method.is sometimes also useful in banishing some particular painful thought, such as the -dislike of closed spaces or that vague fear of impending disaster which is so well known.Patients who have had experience of the old-fashioned hypnotism are sometimes a little ner-vous of the process, arid therefore it is never adopted until a man fully realises that it is a purely natural cure. It is a remarkable fact that the greatest success in its application occurs when the subject was originally a man of good will power and concentration ; for it is really a question of the patient treating himself by concentration with aid from the doctors suggestions; and hence the stronger his will the more he will benefit. Hypnot-ism is never used at the clinic except with the special wish of a patient who has previously bene-fitted by it.When a man has realised the first condition of cure an easy mind; when he has learnt to rob evil memories of their power to hurt him by the simple expedient of telling them out; and when natural sleep has returned, there yet remains much to be done if doctor and patient can work together. In the material way, choice of occupa-tion requires careful thought, and it is good for a man to have sound advice as to the quantity of work he can do with best effect. For example, it is a common thing for a sleepless man to try to tire himself by excessive exercise or work and he needs to be shown how harmful such a practice is. But perhaps even more important is to use the doctor as one to whom confidences may be freely told and grievances frankly discussed.If it is true that a friend can halve grief and double joy, it is good if a doctor, by sympathy and readiness to help, can win that place. Perhaps the physicians of the clinic may believe that they have in some measure attained to it, seeing that it is the commonest thing for patients who have recovered and. been discharged to come back from time to time to have a chat on matters quite apart from their medical needs!This, then., very briefly, is the work which the Lancaster Clinic has set itself to do to teach a simple understanding of necessary facts of mental health and to give practical help in a struggle that is rarely easy but sure enough to end the right way if the best and wisest is done. It is hard and exacting work for the doctor perhaps more so than the patient ever guesses but there is the great reward that many a man has been helped to find himself again, and to recover that hap-piness in life which perhaps he feared had passed away for good.   .Training for disabled men has been established by the Essex War Pensions Committee in fruit farming with Messrs. Seabrook, at Chelmsford; in dairy and poultry farming at Warley Lea; in clerical work for secretarial employment at the Head Office.A fortnight&apos;s holiday in the country or at the sea-side for 3,000 motherless children of sailors and soldiers is another contribution to voluntary effort made by the committee of the Fresh Air Fund.

Sir Matthew Nathan, G.C.M.G., having resigned the Secretaryship of the Ministry of Pensions on his appointment as Chairman of the Special Grants Committee, Mr. George Chrystal has been appointed Secretary of the Ministry of Pensions in his stead.Mr. Chrystal has previously held several important positions in the Civil Service, which he entered in 1904. His first appointment was at the Admiralty,. but two years later he was transferred to the Home Office, where he acted as Joint Secre-tary to the Royal Commission on Mines and the Royal Commission on Metalliferous Mines and Quarries, and held from time to time other secre-tarial posts. He was Private Secretary to the Par-liamentary and Permanent Under Secretaries of State and also to the Home Secretary. In August, 1917, he went to the Ministry of National Service as an Assistant Secretary, being appointed laterChief Assistant Secretary. After a brief spell at the Local Government Board he became Secretary of the Ministry of Reconstruction in succession to Mr. Vaughan Nash and also Secretary to the Ministry of National Service.PREVIOUS PENSIONS INCREASED.The Minister of Pensions, Sir Laming Worth-ington-Evans, made a welcome announcement, when, in reply to a recent question in the House, he stated that the Government had. decided to make a further provision for those in receipt of pensions for wars previous to the Great War which came officially to an end on 28th June, 1919.By Royal Warrants of April and September of last year, men totally disabled, or suffering from certain specified wounds and injuries received in former war-service, had already been granted an increase of pension to the present rates. &apos; The widows of non-commissioned officers and men who had died in former wars had also been granted an increase.By the present decision the pensions granted to all men for former wars, whatever the nature of their disability, are to be similarly raised to the present rates; and, further, the same concession has been extended to officers, naval warrant officers, and nurses, wholly or partially disabled, and to the widows of officers and naval warrant officers who died in previous wars.The increased rates will apply only to men already pensioned in respect to former wars. Where a claim for pension has previously been considered and refused, the case cannot again be considered by reason of this decision. It will ordinarily be necessary for officers and menclaim-ing an increased rate of pension to be medically examined in order to determine the degree of dis-ablement on which the new rate of pension should be assessed; and it should be understood that regard can be. had only to the disability for which the original pension was granted, and to the present degree of incapacity resulting from that disability.The increased rates of pension, to which will be added the war bonus, of 20 per cent, payable on pensions for the present war, will date from the 1st April last.In the case of officers, widows of, officers, and nurses full information in regard to most cases can be obtained from the War Office and the Pay-master-General. But it will be open to any officer or widow or nurse to apply to the Ministry of Pensions (Officers Awards Branch), New North Street, London, W.C.Disabled army warrant officers&apos;, non-commis-sioned officers and men should apply to the Minis-try of Pensions, Burton Court,- Chelsea,- S.W..3; naval ratings to the Ministry of Pensions, West-minster House, Millbank, S.W.I. Applications should be marked on the envelope &quot;Pre-war Pen-sions Section&quot;; and should. state, the mans Lull
name and address, regimental number and rank (or rating), regiment (ship or unit), date of dis-charge, and present rate (and number) of the pension and date of award of pension.It only remains to say that the fullest particulars should accompany any enquiry or application.ATTACHMENT  OF  PENSION.It has been ruled that no pension can be attached&apos; in order to enforce any order of the Court, unless the pensioner has been made a bankrupt and an Order obtained under S.51 (2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, ordering the pension or any part thereof to be paid to the Trustee in Bankruptcy.The Minister of Pensions has power by virtue of Art. 1211 of the Pay Warrant, 1914, which is incorporated in the present Pay Warrant for Soldiers, to apply the pension in satisfaction of the claim of Guardians where the Pensioners family has Obtained Parish Relief. The case of sailors is similarly provided for in Art. 1974 of the King&apos;s Regulations.Subject to these two exceptions no order of a County or other Court against a pensioner for maintenance can be enforced against the man&apos;s disablement pension.This decision does not, however, affect the prac-tice of the Pensions Issue Office, under which that Department, when satisfied as to the fact of desertion, stops the issue to the man of children&apos;s allowances, and pays such allowances for the benefit of the children.EMPLOYERS&apos; HELP.Employers, who had in their employment, previous to the outbreak of war, men who have since served in the Navy, Army or Air Force, will render invaluable assistance by preserving carefully their wages books and similar records for the year preceding the 4th August, &quot;1914.The amount of an alternative pension pay-. able to a disabled man or to the widow of a sailor, soldier, or airman, who has lost his life in the war, depends upon proof of average earnings during that year; and if no records exist in the case of widows it is especially difficult, in such, circumstances to obtain reliable data as to the husband&apos;s pre-war earnings delay in the award of an alternative pension and consequently hard-ship may ensue.Great difficulty in verifying pre-war earnings has already been - experienced owing to the destruction of - wages books; and employers, who give the necessary instructions,, will con-tribute to the more efficient administration of pensions, and will help to safeguard the interests of &quot;the widows and disabled men.a scheme for training ex-Service men in monumental masonry work has been prepared by the Tunbridge Wells War Pensions Committee,FROM OVERSEAS.AUSTRALIA.About 1,000 returned soldiers are to be trained for employment in the New South Wales Govern-ment Railway workshops, and will be absorbed in the railway service during the next two years..The Ministry of Public Works is at work on the plans for important buildings for the vocational training of returned soldiers. The buildings in-clude a pottery department at the. Brunswick Technical Schools for instruction in all branches of pottery; at Brighton, a workshop for instruc-tion in metal and woodwork; at Caulfield, a far-riery school and a wheelwright^ shop; at West Melbourne, new buildings to be devoted entirely to vocational training of returned soldiers.Railway construction in Queensland is in con-templation for the purpose of opening up land for soldier settlers. The estimated cost of railway work is  1,420,000; and the area to be opened up is some 2,500,000 acres.A year ago an Advisory Committee, appointed by the Wool Trade Advisory Committee, was entrusted with the supervision of training returned soldiers in the treatment of wool. Out of 112 men trained, 60 have been permanently employed by the various wool scourers and wool stores in and about Melbourne; a considerable number have remained permanently at wool stations; and only 12 returned for further employment.CANADA.The.British Columbian Legislature has taken powers to acquire by compulsory purchase land required for settlement.Men undergoing training under the special training department of the Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-es-establishment do not draw pension if training pay and allowance are pay-able during, the period. Their status, so far as the Pensions Board is concerned, is that of a man not on pension.Repatriation Office Work: Canada.NEW  ZEALAND.In April last it was estimated that there were 5,000   permanently   disabled   soldiers   in   the
Dominion. Suggestions have been made that the Government should establish industries suitable for disabled men, and protect these industries by sub-subsidies or a protective tariff,The Soldiers&apos; Associations are asking that the Government shall increase the staffs of the land offices, and that the Land Boards shall hold weekly meetings to cope with the applications from prospective settlers. ;SOUTH  AFRICA.A scheme., for settling soldiers on the land in South Africa provides for two classes of settlers  those who require a free grant and those who are prepared to purchase. Some thousand farms are at present available, and will be leased for 999 years, the State continuing to draw revenue from the leaseholds.U.S.A.Senator Kenyon, of IoWa, is introducing a Bill to separate the claim to vocational training from pension considerations and to provide for the train-ing of all disabled soldiers. At present a soldier cannot obtain compensation (pension) unless his injury impairs his earning capacity 10 per cent., nor,vocational training unless he has been allowed compensation.FRANCE.A Government Employment Bureau for de-mobilised men has recently been opened in Paris. The departmental bureaux are considered not sufficiently in touch with employers.By decree of 21st May, 1919, widows in receipt of a war pension may apply for vocational training with a view to employment.ITALY.The number of war. pensions settled monthly was recently steadily increasing. The Com-mittee for Military Assistance and for War Pen-sions examined.in December 7,705 cases, which increased monthly.to 9,099 cases in March. The applications for the same months were 7,500 and 9,687 respectively.   -EMPIRE SETTLEMENT.His Majesty&apos;s Government has decided that as from the 8th April, 1919, ex-service men, viz., officers and men of the Royal Navy, the British Army (excluding Dominion and Colonial Forces) or the Royal Air Force, who have served in the present- war and who wish to settle within the Empire overseas, may obtain free third class pas-sages at the lowest Government rate for themselves and their dependents. to the nearest convenient port to their destination.   This is provided theyare approved under one of the agricultural settle-ment schemes of the Oversea Governments or are going to assured employment, and are otherwise acceptable to the Government of the territory to which they desire to go. This privilege will also be extended to the widows and dependents of ex-service men as defined above, provided that they are entitled to draw pension from Imperial Funds under the terms of the Pensions Warrant.Free passages on the same conditions will be granted to ex-service women who enrolled for whole-time service for not less than six months in a corps under the direction of a British Govern-ment Department.The&apos; term &quot; dependent&quot; includes, in the case of ex-service men, legal wives and legitimate sons and step-sons under 16 years of age and legitimate daughters and step-daughters under 18 years of age; in the case of ex-service women and widows of ex-service men, legitimate children as defined above.The chief Corps included in the definition of ex-service women are the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service; Queen Mary&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps; Women&apos;s Royal Air Force; Women&apos;s Legion; Queen Alexandras Imperial Military Nursing Ser-vice and Reserve; Queen Alexandra^ Royal Naval Nursing Service and Reserve; Territorial Force Nursing Service; the V.A.D, Naval and Military Nursing and General Service Members, and mem-bers under contract to the British Red Cross and Order of St. John of Jerusalem Joint War Com-mittee; Women&apos;s Land Army ; Scottish Women&apos;s Land Army; Women&apos;s Forage Corps; Women&apos;s Forestry Corps.The grant of free passages will include the grant of a third class railway warrant from the place of residence to the port of embarkation;Although pensioners and reservists are eligible for a free passage under the above conditions, their applications cannot be granted until they have been referred to the Navy, Army or Air Force Authori-ties for the grant of permission to proceed abroad as required by the regulations. Pensioners and reservists include, in the case of Naval ranks and ratings, officers on the Reserved, Retired or Emer-gency Lists, R.N., officers of the Reserve and Special Reserve of Officers, Royal Marines, and pensioners or reservists; in the case of the Army, officers of the Reserve of Officers, Special Reserve of Officers and Territorial Force, and soldiers belonging to any class of the Reserve, except Class &quot; Z &quot;; and in the case of the Air Force, officers on the unemployed list and airmen in.Class &quot; E&apos;&apos; Reserve. Soldiers in &quot;Z&quot; Reserve and airmen in &quot; G &quot; Reserve do not requjre permission to proceed overseas.It is not intended that the Government should provide special shipping accommodation in connec-tion with this scheme; and passages can only be obtained as space becomes available in the ordinary course.   This, however, will not involve any delay
in dealing with applications; and applicants, as soon as they have been accepted, will be furnished with a voucher which they can - exchange for a passage ticket without payment through the usual channels. Approved applicants may avail them-selves of any superior class on payment of the difference to the shipping companies.It is, in any case, unlikely that the Governments of the Self-Governing Dominions will be able to provide for ex-service men and women from this country as settlers on the land during the present year, owing to the need for settling their own returning troops. It is therefore improbable that more than a very limited number of free passages to those Dominions can be granted before the beginning of 1920. Even if the Dominions are willing to receive intending settlers from this country earlier than that date, shipping accommo-dation will probably not be available for such settlers in any number until the return of the Dominion troops has been completed. This does not, of course, apply to those ordinarily resident in other parts of the Empire, for whom repatriation arrangements are already in force.In these circumstances it has been arranged that applications may be sent in at any time up to the end of December, 1920, or within one year from the date of release from service, whichever date is the latest.Ex-service men and women need, therefore, be in no hurry to put in their application, and they should iii their own interests make sure, before making application, that openings are not avail-able at home. The largest number of opportunities -ties overseas is likely to be open to men with agri-cultural experience, and to women who are pre-pared to take up work as helps in the home or on a farm. In any case it must be clearly understood that free passages will only be granted to appli-cants who are ascertained to be acceptable to the Oversea Governments.Applicants are warned that it is desirable not to take any final steps towards breaking up their household arrangements, etc., till the last possible moment. No liability can be accepted, by the Government on this account.Arrangements are being made to provide approved applicants with a document which will take the place of a passport.Local War Pensions Committees are asked to assist the Overseas Settlement Committee by comparing the &quot; ringpaper &quot; of widows or depen-dents with the particulars on the application, and forwarding the application form. Applications from ex-service men and ex-service women will not, however, come before local committees.Forms of application are obtainable from the Secretary, Oversea Settlement Office, 59, Victoria Street, London, S.W.I, or from any Employment Exchange, or District Office of the Appointments Department, or, in the case of ex-service women, from Corps Headquarters.THE K.L.M.C.H.BY&apos; A CORRESPONDENT.There is probably no better-equipped Hospital Camp in the Kingdom than the King&apos;s Lancashire Military Convalescent Hospital, Blackpool.The -generosity of the people of Lancashire enabled the officers v/ho administered the hospital to augment the elaborately equipped curative departments with a fine Gymnasium and Cinema Theatre, a bowling green and sports grounds. In fact the lawns and gardens of the K.L.M.C.H., as it is familiarly called, have been a familiar resort of the people of Lancashire and adjoining counties. It is therefore very pleasing to hear that this splendid Treatment Camp is to be taken over by the Ministry of Pensions as a Convales-cent Centre for discharged disabled men. The men who go to the K.L.M.C.H. should find their&apos; lot to a great extent mitigated by the proximity to Blackpool, which probably offers more opportunities for entertainment than any seaside place in Europe, and to the sand dunes and baths of St. Anne&apos;s-on-the-Sea. The kindliness of the local residents to all those who serve or have served in the Army and Navy should go a long way to shorten their period of convalescence.When taken over by the Ministry of Pensions, , the institution will be used for the purpose of giving discharged disabled men who are unable to follow their pre-war occupation training in the technique of new occupations, at the same time as they are receiving treatment for their disabilities. Workshops will be constructed, in which technical experts will instruct and superintend the pen-sioner.Under the new regime liberty will be interfered with as little as possible. The rules laid down for discipline will be simple and free from onerous restrictions, the idea being to make the man&apos;s stay happy and homelike. All the extensive means of recreation and amusement will be available, and by converting the present residential hutments into cubicles, privacy and comfort will be secured. -It has always been the wish of the Lancashire people that the K.L.M.C.H., of which they are naturally proud, should continue to be used for the benefit of those who have suffered in the ser-vioe of their Country. The news therefore that it is being taken over by the Ministry of Pensions has given great pleasure throughout the County Palatine; and no doubt those generous citizens who have so cordially supported it in the past will continue to evince their practical interest in the discharged man as they did in the serving soldier.Mr. Oppenheimer entertained seven, hundred people at Brighton in celebration of ,Peace. These guests consisted of the ex-Service men employed by Mr. Oppen-heimer&apos;s Diamond Works, Lewes Road, Brighton, and their relatives and friends.A diamond cutting centre for disabled soldiers has been opened at Fort William by the Duchess of Montrose.

The training of these men is carried out in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of Labour, and the results are significant of what can be accomplished by those men who are determined to start a new life and overcome the limitations of their disablement. It is no mean achievement to fashion inlaid cabinets, dressing tables and chests of drawers when per-haps you have not had more than three or four months&apos; training.Sometimes the joy to create carries the man beyond the stage which his training provides for. One such instance was demonstrated by an excellent piece of silver work a fruit dish pierced to a set design. This was the work of a man after five months&apos; ordinary training, which does not go beyond shaping the article. A Gothic clock, delicately finished by a man formerly a blacksmith, Georgian tea caddies, Queen Anne trinkets, and some very creditable pieces of jewellery were among other striking examples of the aptitude of our disabled.It is the more gratifying and remarkable when it is remembered that none of the students had had any pre-vious experience, and that their training had in no case covered more than a period of five months, sometimes a good deal less.

335rview of the reduction of staffs in the various public Depart-ments, it is the policy of the Government to insist that no competent ex-Service man, graded as temporary or per-manent, is discharged till all those who have not served have been dispensed with; and, in view of the changes now being made in the staffs of the various Departments, . will any dismissal of ex-Service men and their replaee-ment by women be discontinued forthwith?The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. A. Chamberlain): A Committee is considering&apos; what immediate practical steps can be taken to extend the employment of ex-Service men in the Government service generally, and I hope that it may be able to report at an early date on the whole question. I am not aware that any Government Depart-ment is discharging ex-Service men and replacing them as suggested. If the hon. and gallant Member has any particular case in mind, I will gladly look into it. on receipt of particulars.    -SERVICE GRATUITIES.Sir W. Seager asked the Secretary of State for War if he is aware of the discontent prevailing amongst demobil-ised men because of the long period they have to wait for the payment of their gratuities; does he know that many sailors and soldiers have to wait from four to seven weeks or more after the gratuity has been deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank for payment; and will he take action in the matter to avoid this serious delay?Mr.&apos; Forster : The arrangements for the payment of gratuities to demobilised men provide for the Post Office Savings Bank book being ready for issue at the local post office on the last day of the man&apos;s dispersal furlough. If the hon.;Member will give me particulars of any individual cases of failure which may have come to his notice I shall be glad &quot;to haye them investigated.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS (DEDUCTIONS).&apos; Colonel Ashley asked the Secretary to the Treasury whether he will introduce legislation to absolve a Govern-ment Department from the legal obligation to deduct 10 per cent, from the salary of ex-Service men in their em-ployment who are also in receipt of a disability or Service pension and whose salary exceeds ^400 a year? -Mr. Baldwin (Joint Financial Secretary to the Treas-ury)A Bill will be introduced forthwith.PRE-WAR DISABILITY (INCREASED PENSIONS).3rd July, 1919. ; Colonel Ashley asked the Pensions Minister whether he can yet make a statement as to the possibility of increase of pensions being allowed to those who have been granted disability pensions in consequence of former wars?Captain Reginald Terrell asked the Pensions Minister whether the plight of old pre-war Army pensioners has been brought before him; and whether he is taking any steps to secure the increase of-the awards they receive?Sir L. -Worthington-Evans : I am glad to be able to inform the. House that the Government decided last week to increase the pensions of officers and men disabled through: service, in former wars so as to bring them generally to the level of the pensions given for disabilities sustained in the present War- I would remind:the House that-steps.in this direction were-made last year, when increases were approved in the pensions granted to sea-&apos; men, marines, and soldiers totally incapacitated by war disabilities from earning a livelihood, and to those partially disabled by specific wounds . and injuries. It has now been decided to extend the concession to ; officers, naval warrant officers, nurses, and men disabled, / whether wholly&apos; or... partially, through vvourids,&quot; injuries, or disease due directly and wholly to war service, and actually in- receipt of; disability pensions on that account,1 and to increase their pensions tothe rates for which they would now, under the present Warrants, be eligible in respect of the same disability. To the revised rates will be added the temporary bonus of 20 per cent, approved for cases arising from the present War under the same conditions. The House may also remember, that the pensions of widows of men dying in fu.* mur wars were, by the concession of last year, increased to the rates for the present War. Ithas now been decided that.any increases in the scales of pensions for widows of officers and naval warrant officers allowed in the. present War shall be extended to cases of past wars. This will affect widows of subalterns in receipt of the highest rate of pension, and widows of officers of all ranks in receipt of the intermediate rate for war service, and the widows of naval warrant officers who died on war service. Further, the bonus of 20 per cent, will be added to these increased pensions and also to any existing pensions not so increased of the widows, children, mothers, and sisters of officers who died through war service. All these concessions will have effect from the 1st April, 1.919. Steps are immediately being taken to give effect to these decisions, but the process of investigation must take a little time, and I must ask that pensioners and their friends will exercise patience. In the case of officers, nurses, and naval warrant officers, and their relatives, it is anticipated that most cases can be traced through the records of the Admiralty and War Office, but it is open to any pensioner, officer, or nurse &quot;who has a claim to increase under these conditions to apply to the Ministry of Pensions (Officers&apos; Awards Branch), New North Street, London, W.C. Army warrant officers, non-commisioned officers, and men&apos;s cases cannot similarly be identified from records at Head-quarters, and any men who therefore consider that they are entitled to the concession should apply to the Ministry of Pensions. Full instructions as to application will be issued in the public Press, and will also be communicated to Local War Pensions Committees, who may be able to assist the men to make their claims.ALTERNATIVE PENSIONS.Major M TCenzie Wood asked the Pensions Minister why a man who has lost both an arm and a leg as a result of wounds received in action is not put on the same footing as regards alternative pension as one who has lost both arms or both.legs; and whether he Will take steps to remove such differentiation ?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : The-provision in the Royal Warrant relating to the alternative pensions of men who have lost both arms or both legs or are blind embodies a special privilege given in cases of the severest forms of disablement, and I am not prepared.to say that men who have lost one arm and one leg are in quite the same category. They are, however, scheduled as disabled-111; ,the highest degree, and are given a full disablement pension. . -HOSPITAL CASES (RELATIVES&apos; VISITS). ;Lieutenant-Colonel Archer-Shee asked the Pensions Minister whether the near relations of a discharged soldier undergoing treatment in a civil &quot;hospital for disabilities contracted on service are entitled to half-fare railway vouchers wheii visiting him ; and, if so, to whom they should apply for these vouchers?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : The answer is in the nega-tive. But in the event of the condition of.a patient become-ing-critical local committees would be justified in paying the cost of raihvay journeys undertaken by his nearest relative. -  ,EX-SERVICE MEN (GRANTS WHILE TRAINING.Lieutenant-Colonel Archer-Shee asked the Minister of: Labour whether discharged officers and men who do not desire to return to their pre-war employment, and wish to take training courses for other posts are eligible for the
Maintenance Grant; and whether he is aware that appli-cants at the Ministry at Horrex&apos;s Hotel are being refused this grant on the grounds that they could obtain employ-ment in their former occupation?Sir R. Home : The answer to the first part of the ques-tion depends upon circumstances. It has, however, been laid down as a general principle that, if a candidate^ pre-war employment was of a professional nature or belonged to the higher branch of commercial work, and if he is able to return to it, a grant out of public funds would not be justified for the purpose of training him to quality for a new employment. If any of the cases referred to in the second part of the question are not covered by this general principle, I shall be glad to have particulars with a view to inquiry.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS (EXaSERVICE MEN).Lieutenant-Colonel Archer-Shee asked the Minister of Labour whether the Committee he has set up to inquire into the possibility of replacing women employed in Government Departments by ex-Service men will extend their investigations to Woolwich Arsenal and Dockyard and include not only clerical duties but other work essen-tially suitable for disabled men?Sir R. Home : The terms of reference of the Committee to which my. hon. Friend refers are to inquire(i) into the possibility of the more extensive employ-ment of disabled soldiers in Government Depart-ments;(2) into the question of substituting ex-Service men for temporary women clerks in Government Depart-ments.It is not proposed to extend the scope of the Committee&apos;s inquiry to Government industrial establishments. These establishments raise a separate problem.EX-SERVICE MEN (TRAINING).Mr. R. Gwynne asked the Minister of Labour whether the scheme for training ex-Service men in new occupations is yet in force; and, if so, how many men are at present undergoing training?Sir R. Home: A scheme of industrial training is in operation for disabled ex-Service men who are medically unfit to resume their previous occupation or who cannot resume it without diminution of earnings. The number of disabled men in training on 25th June was 11,350. The provision of facilities is still considerably less than is required, but arrangements to provide training for all who require it are being pushed forward with great rapidity. The Ministry of Labour have authority to pro-vide training for fit ex-Service men who, on account of joining His Majesty&apos;s Forces at a comparatively early age, did not enter upon an apprenticeship to a skihed trade. Training in the organised trades can only be undertaken by agreement with the representatives of employers and employed, and the amount of training which at present it is possible to provide is limited.Mr. Gwynne asked the Minister of Labour how many ex-officers are at present receiving training as a result of the scheme inaugurated by the Ministry of Labour?Sir R. Home : The number of ex-officers and men for whom grants have been sanctioned under the training scheme administered by the Appointments Department of the Ministry of Labour is 1,001, of whom 754 are already in training. In addition to these, many officers are in training at educational institutions, and on the land, under the training scheme of the Ministry&apos;of Labour; but these are passed on to and are supervised by the Education Department and the respective Boards of Agriculture after they have been approved as eligible by the Ministry of Labour.PENSIONS BONUS.7th July, 1919. Colonel Sir Alexander Sprot asked the Pensions minister whether any increase is contemplated to the pensions of pre-war soldiers who have not been disabled, but who have qualified for pensions by length of service in the Army; whether any increase or bonus has been granted in such cases during the War on account of increased cost of living; and whether any inquiry has been made into this matter by Departmental or other committee?Mr. Forster: This question was considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in its application to the Navy, and the decision, as announced, was that:&quot; the revised scales (of pensions) will apply to all future pensioners, all pensioners now serving, and all who have served during the War.&quot;I do not doubt that a similar decision will in due course be applied to the Army.SOLDIERS (MEDICAL TREATMENT).10th July, 1919. Lieutenant-Colonel W. Guinness asked the Pensions Minister whether he is aware that under existing regula-tions no provision is made for admission to suitable insti-tutions of men discharged from the Army on account of neurasthenia, melancholia, and epilepsy in Ireland; whether melancholia cases brought on by shell shock and amputation of limbs have in consequence been admitted to lunatic asylums in Ireland where they are treated as pauper lunatics; and whether he will take steps to pro-vide maintenance and treatment for such cases in special institutions?Sir J. Craig : There are two institutions in Ireland avail-able for neurasthenics. As far as I am aware, there are no epileptic colonies in Ireland with which arrangements for the reception of discharged men can be made, and it is therefore necessary to bring the few cases of epilepsy to England. Men are only placed in asylums if they are certified under the Lunacy LaWs, and I am now arranging that men so certified shall be treated as service patients.Lieutenant-Colonel Guinness : What, in effect, will be the difference between the treatment of service patients and the ordinary pauper patient?Sir J. Craig : Oh; very great. Special arrangements will be made by the medical officers. There is a distinct difference between the two classes.DISABLED  MEN  (EMPLOYMENT).Mr. Leonard Lyle asked the Minister of Labour if he has considered the policy of publishing locally lists of manufacturers who have taken on partially-disabled soldiers, with the object of stimulating others to follow their example; and whether he will give the numbers of disabled men who have actually been so taken on either by their previous employers or by others?Sir R. Home : I hope shortly to be in a position to announce the details of a scheme for the employment of disabled ex-Service men in industry generally. In this connection I am in favour of publishing locally the names of employers who co-operate. With regard to the second part of the hon. Member&apos;s question, the number of men in receipt of disablement pensions was 770,000 on 1st July, 1919. The number registered as unemployed at Employ-ment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 6th June, 1919, was 43,501. Of the remainder it is estimated that, roughly, 50 per cent, have returned to their previous employers; the balance (with the exception of those undergoing training) must be supposed to have found new employment.DISABLEMENT  PENSIONS.Lieutenant-Colonel W. Guinness asked the Pensions Minister whether the present temporary 20 per cent, in-crease on all disablement pensions will be made permanent?Sir J. Craig : The bonus of 20 per cent, was temporary. I am, however, able to announce that the period of its
336currency has been extended to the end of the present year, before the expiration of which my right hon. Friend will make a further statement.OFFICERS&apos; WARRANT (RETIRED PAY).Mr. Pennefather asked the Pensions Minister whether he can make any statement on the subject of increasing the allowances payable to officers undergoing treatment, having regard to the inequalities existing in this respect between the officers&apos; warrant and the men&apos;s?Sir J. Craig : I am glad to be able to announce the following extension of Article 6.of the Officers&apos; Warrant:In special circumstances maximum retired pay will be given to an officer (whether married or single) who is certified to be incapable of work and for whom non-institutional treatment is recommended by the medical authorities.In the case of an officer receiving institutional treat-ment an allowance not exceeding ^50 a year will be granted to the wife, or an allowance not exceeding ^40 a year to a dependant relative (as defined in the Royal Warrant), provided that in either case there is pecuniary need.In cases where it is certified that a disabled officer should, in consequence of his disablement, undergo medical treatment in circumstances which do not render him unable to provide for his own support and that of his family, but require him to absent himself from his work on one or more occasions in a week, he may be granted, in addition to any pension, an allowance not exceeding 20s. a week for the time he is required to absent himself.DISCHARGED  SOLDIER.Mr. Briant asked if a discharged soldier receiving a temporary pension for service during the late War is eligible to continue to receive at the same time the life pension which was granted for previous service?Sir J. Craig : If the life pension were granted purely for length of service, or for disability other than that for which the temporary pension is awarded, the two pensions can be held concurrently. The combined awards in respect of disability must not, however, exceed the total disablement rate of pension.LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES (SOLDIER REPRESENTATIVES).Mr. Lyle. asked the Minister of Labour whether he has decided to strengthen the local advisory committees by the addition of soldier representatives, so that they will carry more conviction and have the value of expert assistance?Sir R. Home : (On the assumption that the hon. Mem-ber is referring to representatives of discharged men, the reply is that action on the lines indicated by the hon. Member was taken within a few months of the estab-lishment of the committees. Representatives of the various associations of discharged and demobilised men are now serving on approximately 80 per cent, of these committees, and, in addition, these associations are strongly represented on the sub-committees specially con-cerned with the interests of discharged men. I am now dealing with those cases where these men are not at present represented.ARMY RESERVE.Colonel Ashley asked the Pensions Minister whether he is aware that Section B men of the Army Reserve whose pensions have been assessed at 5s. 6d. per week are being told that they must suffer reduction of this by the amount of their Reserve pay, or 3s. 6d. per week, thus leaving them 2s. only as pension; whether it is his decision that Reserve pay given in consideration of liability for furtherservice should be counted as part pension for disablement incurred in past service; and, if so, whether this is at variance with the policy which permitted all re-enlisted pensioners during the War to draw both their pensions and their full regimental rates of pay?Sir J. Craig : Under the Demobilisation Regulations issued by the Army Council a soldier serving on a normal regular engagement, and not merely for the period of the War, was automatically reverted to Class B or D of the Army Reserve to complete his engagement. j At the same time he was given an opportunity of claiming a disablement pension. If the claim was substantiated, the transfer to the Reserve was cancelled and his dis-charge carried out as from date of leaving the Colours. Pension would be awarded from that date and, regardless of the amount of pension awarded, it would be necessary to recover the Army Reserve pay already issued, and the soldier would thus be in exactly the same position as if he had been discharged or transferred to Class Z at once instead of being transferred to Class B of the Reserve.WOUNDED SOLDIERS (DISCHARGE FURLOUGH).14th July, 1919.Viscount Wolmer asked the Secretary of State for War whether he is aware that wounded men who are in hospital at the time of their discharge have been refused the military furlough on full pay that has been accorded to fit men; and can he state what is the justification for this treatment?Mr. Churchill: It is very important that these men should be under the care of the Ministry of Pen-sions immediately they leave the hospital, and accord-ingly they are discharged to pension on the day they leave. In order that they may not be at a disadvantage as compared with other soldiers, if the pension they receive during the first twenty-eight days is less than their Army pay and allowance, the difference is made up from Army funds.MERCANTILE MARINE (PRISONERS OF WAR).15th July, 1919. Lieut-Colonel Burgoyne asked the Pensions Minister whether any provision has been made to meet the needs of repatriated  prisoners  of  war of  the  Mercantile Marine?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions (Colonel Sir James Craig): The Ministry of Pensions is concerned with only a small proportion of the Mercantile Marine, namely, those ratings who signed certain Admiralty agreements and were under naval discipline. Such men are pensionable on the same terms as men of the Royal Navy, and can apply to their Local War Pensions Committee at any time after demob-ilisation if suffering from a disability due to or aggra-vated by service.NUMBER DISCHARGED AND RE-EMPLOYED.Sir Francis Lowe asked the Minister of Labour how many sailors and soldiers have now been discharged or demobilised ; how many of these have been reinstated in their former civilian occupations; how many of these have been settled in new civilian occupa-tions; and what steps are being taken to find employ-ment for those who are not yet provided for?Sir R. Home: The number of men discharged or demobilised from His Majesty&apos;s Forces up to 3rd July, 1919, was 2,959,862. Leaving out of account the men still on furlough, the percentage of men resettled is estimated at 87.1. I have no accurate information enabling me to discrimiinate between the proportion reinstated in their former civilian occupation and those resettled in new civilian occupations, but it is estimated roughly at half and half. Every effort is being made to deal with the men who have not yet been reabsorbed,
MINISTRY OF PENSIONS CIRCULARS.July 4th, 1919. Circular 183.-Payment of 20 per cent Bonua on Recoverable Advances and on Advances under Circular Si.The Minister of Pensions has had under consideration the practice of paying Recoverable Advances, and Advances to Widows under Circular 34, without the addition of the 20 per cent. Bonus, and he has now decided to authorise the payment of the bonus with these advances in all cases where they are made in anticipation of a pension or allowance which will itself cany bonus. Payment may commence as from the 12th instant.This concession, it will be observed, applies to all recoverable ad-vances made to (a) discharged disabled men to whom pensions have been awarded; (b) demobilised men and claimants under Article 9 whose cases are under consideration; and (c) men appealing to the Appeal Tribunal. It will also apply to advances to widows under Circular 34 where made at Article 11 rates; but inasmuch as pension under Article 17 is payable, without bonus it will not apply to advances at Article 17 rates.Advances in all these cases obviously involve risk of loss to public funds in so far as any of the cases may not ultimately be found entitled to pension. In allowing therefore the addition of bonus the Minister desires to impress upon all Local Committees that notification of thecase must be sent promptly as soon as the first advance is made,. so that early arrangements may be made for bringing it to a settlement.Advances at treatment allowance rates under Circulars 178 and 179 are included in the concession,&apos; and references to payment of these advances &quot;without war bonus&quot; may now be disregarded. The last paragraph of Circular 141 is hereby cancelled.____* It should be borne in mind, however, that where a man under treatment is subject only to a nominal charge of 7s. a week or less for his maintenance, bonus is not payable upon his treatment allowance, but only upon the allowances to his wife and family (if any). The payment of bonus on recoverable advances in like circumstances should be regulated accordingly.July 11th, 191 J. Circular 184.- Statutory RegulationsDeals with (a) the War Pensions (Proceedings, of Committees) Regula-tions, 1919, dated the 16th June, 1910; end (b) the Local and Joint Committees (Administrative Expenses) Regulations, 1919, dated the 16th June, 1919.These Regulations replace the Provisional Regulations of the 7th April last bearing similar titles. The Notes and Instructions appended to the Provisional issue of the Proceedings of Committees Regulations remain in force and should be read in conjunction with the formal Regulations now issued.Q. 260.-What is the status Local Committee?  Presumably he is not a Local Gov-ernment Officer, nor is it clear that he is a Civil Ser-Varit, although the latter seems to be the classification to which the appointment most nearly approximates.A.  The Secretary to a War Pensions Local Committee fs not a Civil Servant nor a Local Government Official. He is the servant of the War Pensions Committee, and his status is very sivi ilar to that of a Sea etary of such a body as a Public or Private Company.&apos; Q. 261.-Can I obtain a gratuity for 16 years&apos; continu-ous service? At present I am in receipt of a temporary disablement pension for the loss of a leg, and would like a&quot; lump sum.A.  Without par iculars of the applicants service and pension, it is impossible to give a satisfactory reply. If the loss of his leg was attributable to the present war and he had 16 years&apos; pensionable service on discharge, he should be in receipt of a service pension in addition to the disablement pension. If he desires to commute the service pension for a lump sum, he must apply to the Secretary, Royal Hospital, Chelsea, S. Wj. If lie wishes to commute the disablement pension he should apply to the Director, Ministry of Pensions, Burton Court, King&apos;s Road, S. W.3, giving very fully his reasons for desiring commutation. He should understand, however, that a disablement pension cannot be commutea unless an applicant satisfies the Minister that positive benefit would undoubtedly accrue to the Pensioner, and that grave hardship ivould be involvea if commutation were refused. Even if commutation is allowed, a Pensioner must retain not less than fj- a week of his pension. .Q. 262.-A. man had to undergo an operation, having his big toe amputated, and after a while was able to do light work, being able to work two or three days a week. We asked for treatment for the purpose of obtaining a surgical boot, and the Medical Referee sanctioned treatment under Instruction 40 until a surgical boot was supplied. Are we justified in paying ros, a week to. this man for the loss of work.A.-If the man is undergoing treatment which necessitates the loss of remunerative working time, he may be com-pensaied for actual loss of wages, in accordance with the rate specified in Instruction 40.Q. 263.-4 was admitted to &quot;hospital under pensionQUESTIONS  AND ANSWERS.of a Secretary to a    scheme on 30th April, 1919, and have a wife and two children. I received  2 us. 6d. for two weeks, and was then told my bonus was taken off because I had not my ring paper, and through the same reason I was refused payment of 10s. extra that the Pensions Doctor had sanctioned for light food. Can you explain the reason these payments were refused?A. - The War Bonus of 20 % was granted in respect of the increased cost of living. It does not apply to the treatment allowance in lieu of pension paid in respect of a man under-goine treatment in an Institution, for the reason that he is being maintained in the Institution, and is therefore unaffected by the increased cost of&quot;maintenance. The Bonus is payable on zvife&apos;s and childretis allowances. A special Diet allowance is not payable in the case of a man in an Institution. The Hospital Authorities will supply such diet as they consider necessary for a maiUs effective treatment.Q. 264.-Is the disablement pension of a regular soldier transferred to Reserve to complete contract of service reduced by amount of his reserve pay? If so, give authority and amount of deduction of a C.S.M.A. A disability pension under the terms of the Royal Warrant cannot be granted to a man who is still in the Army Reserve, Sections A, B, or D, or in the Special Reserve. Consequently a soldier serving on a normal Regular or Special Reserve engagement which has not expired, and who is therefore transferred or re-trans-ferred to the. Army Reserve or Special Reserve on demobilisation, but who then claims a disability pension on Army Form Z.22, has to be discharged from the Reserve before pension can be granted. By arrangements between the Ministry of Pensions and the War Office, the discharge in these. cases is ante-dated to the date from which pension is aw ar dalle ; that is, in cases where the award is made as a result of examination prior to demobilisation, to the date of transfer or re-transfer to the Army Reserve or Special Reserve on demobilisation. This is to the benefit of the man, as the pension would be more than the Reserve pay; but as a result the Reserve pay or Special Reserve bounty which has been issued in respect of the period covered by the award of pension has to be deducted therefrom. The amount to be recovered is, of course, the amount actually received in respect of this period.:   &apos; - london published BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OFFICE.

340mm Zealand -Use of War funds in reply to a protest lodged by tile returned soldiers at Leeston against the vetoing of a grant of  10,000 by the Lady Liverpool Fund at Christchurch towards the establishment of a soldiers1 club, the Hon, G. ftc Russell said the patriotic funds had been raised for the benefit of sick and wounded, disabled, or out-of-employment members of the forces and their dependants.   The fact that the purposes for which the Lady Liverpool, Red Cross, Y,W0C.A. and Salvation Army special funds had been raised might have ceased to exist through the war ending could not, in  the Minister&apos;s opinion, be regarded as a reason why the very large funds remaining at the disposal of their respective executives should be transferred to objects not coming within the scope of war funds.(Auckland Weekly News, April 24.)Supplerneht1ng Pens ionsAIn the course of a statement in regard to the use of war funds, the Hon, Go W- Russell remarked that the funds held by the various approved societies in Hew Zealand amounted to  1,700,000 which on a 5 per cent basis were capable of earning  85,000 per year. This was a magnificent heritage for the benefit of our soldiers, and must be sacredly preserved for them and their dependants/ Ihilo &apos; the Government fs provision in the way of pensions and allowances was probably the most liberal in the world, the patriotic funds would provide a source from which these could bo supplemented.   In holding down this sum for the direct benefit of soldiers, he was thinking of the future and the possibility that men now apparently sound and well might develop trouble as the result of war service.   It was imperative he considered that.such funds should also be kept liquid, and readily available.   The,question was one for the people.to decide through Parliament, which could settle whether the funds collected for the purposes set out in the Act should he diverted to other purposes which, though good in themselves, were outside its scope.   Until that decision was taken it was his duty to refuse approval for   the expenditure of such funds outside the direct scope covered by the Act.(Auckland T7eokly lows, April 24).
341ACTaroix xv.tFRANCE.Provisional Allowances for Disabled Soldiers and _________....._______ Sailors^A proposal was made by the Government that all men disabled in the war should be granted provisional allowances until their regular pensions had been fixed.   It was intended that these provisional allowances should be assessed by special committees, so that the cases might be dealt with expeditiously, but difficulty was experienced in forming the committees and the scheme fell through.In order that the benefit of the scheme should not be entirely lost, a decree was issued on the 18th June, 1919, providing for the payment of a provisional allowance to certain classes of soldiers, and sailors whose circumstances merit special consideration, namely,(1) men in the category of &quot;Ruforme r!o. 2.&quot; (2)   &quot;     &quot;   &quot;        &quot;&quot;       ;&apos;   temporary &quot;Keforme Ho.2.&quot; (3)   &quot;   transferred to the Auxiliary Service on account of disablement.The rates of the provisional allowances for the three groups mentioned above are 4 frs. and 2 frs. a day respectively,   In the case of men in the third group the provisional allowances pre to take the place of separation allowances to their families.   But they may have the option of choosing either to receive the provisional allowance or to continue the separation allowance, if the latter is more advantageous, until the 15th of November,; 1919,The provisional allowance is liable to deduction when the ordinary pension is fixed, if it is more, than the amount of pension to which the man is considered to be entitled.(Journal Official, June 1919)
