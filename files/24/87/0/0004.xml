(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Ofr ttIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S G0VERNME2JT).I&apos;  PORT ,.5Al7ITARY APMX-2TI5TRATI0K. M.H.5.Memorandum by the Minister -of Health.1.    the main duty of Port Sanitary Authorities is to protect the country from the importation of infectious disease.    They also examine foreign imported food, safeguard the purity of shell fish found in their waters and assist the Home Office in the medical examination of aliens. For these purposes they;need a medical and sanitary staff, isolation hospitals, disinfecting stations etc    their expenditure is met chiefly out of local rates.... &apos;2.     At the present time the danger of-the introduction;of disease is considerably increased by the circumstancesconnected with the war.    Diseases such as smallpox, typhus,relapsing fever etc. are widely prevalent in parts of Europe..... &apos;with which considerable&quot; traffic may be expected on the ratification of peace,&apos;and other - diseases such as malaria, dysentery, etc have obtained a footing: in this country, and great vigilance will be required to limit their incidence.    The number of imported cases of plague has also shewn a slight increase since the cessation of hostilities.   &apos;3.    I consider it essential, if the people of this country are to be adequately protected from risk of the&quot;importation of infectious disease, that the staff and       % equipment of Port Sanitary Authorities generally should be thoroughly efficient, and tJae^ have prepared an Order which-is designed to secure the necessary improvements in Port&quot;Sanitary -Administration. .-1-This n^nment Is the Property^
1     ^   14     !4.    Part Sanitary Authorities, however, contend that their work is for the country generally, and should therefore he liberally assisted out of Imperial funds.     The Ministry of Health, share this view,, and have asked, the Treasury for authority to distribute a State grant of half the annual expenditure of Port Sanitary Authorities, which means a grant of about  50,000. per annum.  - The Treasury have offered a. 25% grant on. the expenditure for one year only and have declined to increase the proportion of the grant or to make it an annual grant.     Their view is; that though Port Sanitary Authorities incur&apos; expenditure for- the benefit of the country generally, yet they derive a special profit, from the traffic which occasions that expenditure.5.     The State has in recent, years paid half the; . expenditure of local authorities on the treatment of Tuberculosis, three quarters of their expenditure on the treatment of Venereal Disease, and half the expenditure, both of local authorities and voluntary agencies, on Maternity. and: Child &quot;Welfare, including such services as the provision of midwifery and nursing, salaries of health . -visitors and medical officers,, hospitals,, homes and centres. and other institutions for- expectant, and. nursing mothers and young children.     It appears to me that the work of ... Port Sanitary Authorities-, is of as great importance to the health of the nation, and has. a greater claim on national, as against local, funds than the services in respect of which the principle of a State grant of at least half the&apos; annual, expenditure has already, been recognised as appropriate I am-convinced&apos; that it will be impossible for the Ministry of Health at the present time- to. induce Port. Sanitary Authorities to provide out. of local rates the additional services which are necessary in order to safeguard the
*country from the risk of a considerable importation of dangerous infectious disease, unless we are able to promise them a grant of half .their annual expenditure on these services.     I feel bound, therefore, in view of my responsibility to Parliament in this respect, to request that the Government will put me in a position to secure efficient measures for, the prevention of this danger to health, which the circumstances of the times render exceptionally menacing, by entrusting me with the distribu-tion of the grant for which I aslc.Ministry of Health.
