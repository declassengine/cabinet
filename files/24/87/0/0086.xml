279l&apos;Vo?n l&apos;ice?w/, 29th August 1919. (Received 30th, 11. a.m.)Clear line.1263 S. Secret. 1 Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 26th August. We regret our oversight to report ex parte demarcation proceedings, but they flowed automatically from peace iiegotiatious. For we were pledged (vide our telegram of 1st August, 1114 S.) to carry out demarcation as speedily as possible and,not to use it as pretext for annexation. With the decision (vide your telegrams of 7th July and 16th July read with our 954 8., 29th June, and 1014 S., 10th July) that there would be no attempt at annexation under the guise of demarcation, demarcation resolved itself simply into final definition on the spot of Durand&apos;s line in the vicinity of Khyber hitherto undemareated so as to include the area heretofore claimed as British, all Afghan counterclaims being ignored. This was explained explicitly to Afghan delegates who (as reported in my telegram of the 7th August, 1142 S.) were shown a map embodying our proposals. It is on this principle of asserting once for all our own interpretation of existing facts that Maftey is and has been acting, actually demarcating them on the, spot as he goes along, accompanied by Afghan General Ghulam Nabi, who, though not (? party to) proceedings, is watching them on behalf of Afghan Government. There appears to be, therefore, nothing further to report to His Majesty&apos;s Government if nothing unexpected crops up, until the line is finally demarcated.Any rectification in our favour of Durand line ( (? damaging the) assertion of our previously disputed claims) such as that suggested in your telegram of 16th July will be a matter for consideration and, if necessary, negotiation when prospective friendship treaty comes under discussion.
