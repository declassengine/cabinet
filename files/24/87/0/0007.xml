oThis document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.23DECISIONS OF POLICY REQUIRED.MEMOBANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF TEE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.Circulated by the Secretary of State for Wae.The following is a short list of the four or five important decisions of policy on which much money depends : (a.) When can we come away from Constantinople; and, whilst we remain, what are our responsibilities ?(6.) We are already spending a little money in the Smyrna Theatre. Are we going to he called on for troops and other expenditures?(c;) When can our position in Syria, Palestine and Arabia be defined, so that we can make permanent arrangements as regards our garrisons ?(d.) I understand now that we may repatriate Turkish prisoners from Egypt as soon as possible, but there is some confusion about German prisoners, both in France and in England; these prisoners, amounting to about 300,000 men, require an enormous amount of rationing and a great transportation service, amounting to 60,000 to 80,000 British troops. The earliest possible repatriation of these German prisoners is, therefore, urgently required.(e.) A clear definition of our responsibilities as regards clearing devastated areas in France arid Belgium. At the present moment, M. Clemenceau claims that we have promised to clear the whole place out. This is not so, hut we want .  to have this matter clearly defined.IT. WILSON, Chief of the Imperial General Staff.16th August, 1919.(B19/372)   TO   8/19   H&amp;S   7411wo
