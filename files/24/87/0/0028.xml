AiHIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS MOTIO MA MY^^^ SECRETT, 8037 DCMIHTCEF SHIPPING..ITote by Lord Milner covering telegram to Sir Robert Borden,The Secretary, War Cabinet,V/ith reference to War Cabinet 613, Minute U) of August 13thj 1919, I have to report that, after a Conference between Mr,Bonar Lav;, Sir Joseph Maclay and myself, I cent the enclosed telegram to Sir Robert Borden;(Bgd.) MILHBB.Colonial Office, 8 t7., 17th August, 1919,
-PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of Canada,(Sent 5,55 p.nr. &apos;16.th August 1919).&apos;16th August.      Your telegram of the 9th August, Following for your Prime Minister.&apos;&apos;e recognise the great importance of this matter and the^Government have given earnest consideration to it during the past few days despite unprecedented pressure at the present time..    With regard to the Bilbster I fear that you have been gravely misinformed as to the frets of the case-.    Almost all the allegations on this subject made to you appear to be incorrect.&quot;   The facts are as follows.(1)   Owing to the enormous amount of repatriation work and the general requirements of the Allied countries it has been found a necessity to retain rigid control over British shipping and no British owners are permitted to transfer ships without a definite stipulation that such trans-ference. *oes not carry with it any rights other than those r.f the seller.    In the case of the Bilbster this stipulation was made,and a clear understanding to, that effect come to before permission granted for her sale,.     Shipping Controller holds&apos;letter, dated 12th April 1919, from Fred Tillett Company of London, on behalf of buyers containing the following words:-&quot;Buyers comply with the. conditions as. to making no stipulation regarding transfer of the steamer&apos;s registry and they accept her. with all.liabilities attaching to her (as regards requisitioning or direction by you) by.reason of her being a British vessel registered in this country&quot;.(2)   The Bilbster has never been recognised as a liner, Such recognition was Refused definitely.(3)   She is stated to be quite suitable for carrying timber,(4)   The owners were informed in. writing on June 24 that she was expected to load timber and it is therefore untrue that she only got orders after other cargo had been assembled for her in Montreal8(5)  :It. is not&apos;the case tnat there are two months&apos; delays in the. United Kingdom; although there are detentions every-where including France.(6)    The -Alston and Cape Corso were licenced to carry railway material Srom Canada to France on the representa-tion that such material had been hold up in Montreal for many months.     It was believed that by this permission being granted^Isnadian. interests were being served.In these circumstances it would seem that the requisitioning of the Bilbster cannot be withdrawn.     It must be evident, that, to allow her owners now to&apos; escape from the obligation under.which they bought her and which doubt-less materially affected the purchasing price, would be simply to put money into their pockets,On
On the other hand   on the general question of the transfer of Canadian owned ships to the Canadian Register we are most anxious to meet you.    We propose that subject to adequate safeguards for the maintenance of our present rights in regard to the carriage of Government cargo by liners, all ships that were Canadian owned before the war and any ships&apos; transferred to Canadian owners during the war should now, if their owners desire-it, be transferred to the Canadian Register.I hope that this will tend to   allay the present * discontent and that the Committee to inquire into the&apos; whole sub,; ,ct of sea communications throughout the Empire now being set up will      lead to the establishment of more satisfactory conditions in the future.MILNER.
