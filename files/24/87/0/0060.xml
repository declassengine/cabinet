In what follows the latter aspect is discussed.The wage-earnei is, of course, also a purchaser, and in him are combined resentment against being cheated as a purchaser, and disinclination to do his best as a producer in an &apos; industrial system which tolerates the &quot; profiteer.&quot; In his capacity as purchaser he shares-the fairly common belief that high prices, and every new increase in price, are mainly due to &quot;profiteering.&quot; It would, therefore, help to relieve the present tension if the wage earner, as part of the general public, could be informed as to the deeper causes which have led to the depreciation of money. A little more plain speaking on this score such as that of Mr, Roberts a short time ago, would clear the air and help everyone to draw a distinc-tion between dearness due to general causes and extortion due to particular rapacity. Unless this confusion is straightened out there is likely to be disappointment and even anger at the failure of the machinery set up under the Profiteering Act to bring down the cost of living. It might be explained that the general level of prices is almost wholly a-matter of national and international finance ; the operations of the.&quot; profiteer &quot;are no more than ripples on the surface.&apos; It is important to prevent the ripples, but doing so will not sensibly alter the general level of prices.  Hunting down the profiteer will do some-(0 1873) 265  8/19 h&amp;s 2&apos;BSummary.of Disabled Men.Part I.-Profiteering and Profit.
thing to satisfy the moral sense of the wage-earner, but it will do little to improve or sustain his economic position.In his capacity as producer, one effect of profiteering on the wage-earner is to make less restrained and more impetuous than it would otherwise be the demand for increased wages and shorter hours. The spirit is abroad among workpeople-not with, regard to any particular works or industry, but generally-that there is a great deal going somewhere else that ought to go to them ; and they are determined at last to get at it. This deter-mination no doubt is rooted in events of a period long before the present outcry against profiteering, but the effect of that outcry, and certain evidence that it is, in places at any rate, justified, goes far to intensify the feeling that there is still much to snatch out of the hand of the capitalist and that it shall be snatched at all costs forthwith.Another effect is to make him disinclined to exert himself any more than need be. This is something more than the ordinary human inclination to take things easy ; it is an attitude born both of a comparison and of a doctrine. With regard first to the comparison, the knowledge that some people are getting rich rapidly as a result of developments for which they are not responsible (which either throw a fortune into their lap or put into their hands a lever whereby they can wrench a fortune out of the public in its necessity) breeds a disinclination for honest work. A man who has seen riches rapidly acquired has in so far less heart for accumulation by humdrum toil. In so far as the people who get rich quickly, without any special exertion or merit on their part, come within the scope of the Profiteering Act, and in- so far as the measures to be taken deal drastically with them, this particular drag on production will be removed. The doctrine based on objection to &quot; profiteering,&quot; and the sub-conscious or deliberate policy it induces, is another and a more serious matter. In this connection the term &quot; profiteer &quot; calls for definition. As invented by the writers in the &quot; New Age &quot; it did not mean a person who makes an unconscionable profit, but simply one who produces for private profit instead of for public use the assumption being that the two are by no means identical. It was an epithet intended to discredit the prevailing economic order by emphasising the fact that the primarjr motive and result of industry was private profit, and to advocate an economic order in which profit should have no part. This doctrine was already the economic faith of considerable numbers of workers. It was inherent in all schools of Socialist thought. The popular adoption of the word &quot; Profiteering &quot; and the application of it to particular abuses of profit-making, has, however, contributed to bring profit into wider disrepute. There has been a marked change during the war in the public attitude towards the profit maker. The Socialist case has in consequence been much strengthened, and the view that the individualist system of industry is iniquitous. and intolerable has spread and intensified among working men.This explicit entrance of a moral motive into the economic sphere was not noticed among the many revolutionary things done during the war, and it consorted well enough with the strict control then exercised, which paralysed to a large extent the profit-making motive. Now, however, an attempt is being made to return to pre-war ways, profit is returning to its position of regulator must return, if the State is not to go bankrupt, or an entirely new form of economic society be instituted and it finds itself confronted with this new element, the spirit which denounces its former pretensions as immoral. The demand for control by workers and the concessions that in one form or another have been made to this demand are manifestations of this attitude.*The demand for control is, however, really a dual demand, as has already been pointed out, and the other aspect of it also demands some consideration from this point of view. Beyond being a demand for a new order of economic society, it is a demand first for a control over working conditions and secondly for a full knowledge of those conditions and arrangements e.g., financial which control does not cover. This is perhaps the more important aspect of the demand for control from the practical point of view; it contains that element of nearness and understandability to every individual workman which is necessary to render a cause really powerful; and since it is much easier to meet than the first more doctrinaire demand for complete control, and since every action thwarting it strengthens the hands of those advocating the other, the wise course would appear to be to do what can be done to meet it. Considerable steps have already been taken through Whitley Councils and otherwise to give workpeople a share in the control of the conditions under which they work, but little has as yet been done in the way of giving them access to all the commercial and financial arrangements of the industry or undertaking in which they work, though hints of developments along these* The recent history of the nationalisation question is one form of such concession ; the history of the Joint Industrial Councils is another. Another form can be observed in the results of the deliberations of various organisations, embodied in Reports like that of the Committee of the Building Trades Council, the .North London Manufacturers&apos; Association, or even the 1T.B.I.
lines are to be seen in various quarters. * As has already been pointed out, this is a matter of immense difficulty, and it would appear that any measures taken as regards profiteering have their importance from this point of view in that they may act as a step in the right direction as leading up to and giving promise of further action so soon as this is possible ; and thus in some measure answering and moderating demands for control that it is impracticable on the instant to meet.The above considerations may help to focus the general position of the profiteering machinery about to be set up.  It will not have any very great effect on the general level of prices ; its real work lies in quite another sphere and has both a temporary and a per-manent aspect.  It has been created to meet a difficulty possibly a temporary difficulty, arising out of the difficult circumstances of the time and its first business is to meet this difficulty, in other words to allay the outcry against profiteering and with it all its con-sequences.   But it has a permanent aspect as a definite development in the direction of openness and publicity of working that is bound to precede any real extension of economic democracy.  For practical purposes, however, these two functions both show the necessity of the machinery set up exhibiting the quality of openness of working and gaining the confidence of the community.   Openness to all, where possible ; where im-possible, openness to those that are trusted by all.  For this reason it would seem desirable that ca.re should be taken in setting up&apos; tribunals or costing committees, whether central or. local, to give full consideration to the claims of all representative organisations for a voice on them.  In particular, in dealing with special industries the fullest use should be made of Whitley Councils, Trade Boards, Interim Eeconstruction Committees, etc.  It is believed that this course is being followed, but the criticism may be heard that, e.g., on costing committees, workpeople&apos;s representatives could be of little assistance, since they are neither expert in costing nor are they in touch, with the financial side of the industries which they represent.   The answer is that the workpeople&apos;s representative is not there for what he can say, but for what he can hear.   It may not be important for others to know what he has to say, but it is of the greatest, importance that he should know what they have to say, because here is symbolised the process which may one day rule the whole economic sphere, and of which these committees are the first sign.Part II.-Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Government Scheme for the Resettlement of Disabled Men.Preparations are now well advanced for the launching of the Ministry&apos;s scheme for the employment of disabled ex-Service men, full particulars of which are to be made public on the 15th September. Negotiations with the National Trade Advisory Com-mittees and other bodies reported since the 9th July, when the position was summarised in this Report, have not materially altered the situation. Eight further industries have had the matter under consideration in addition to the 16 then dealt with. The National Industrial Council for the Pottery Industry approved the scheme in principle, but stated that effect could be given to it only if the pivotal men for whom the industry have long been pressing were released, and if the ration of coal allotted to the trade were increased from the amount fixed in June, 1917, when the output of the industry was at its lowest ebb. Negotiations with the iron and steel trades, with the woollen, the cotton and the lace industries have resulted only in an acceptance of the principle of the scheme without any attempt to put forward an accepted percentage for the absorption of disabled men. In the case of the printing industry, willingness has been expressed to take trained men, but the representatives of the trade were not prepared to acquiesce in the suggestion that 5 per cent, should be absorbed.The Resettlement Board of the coal industry have discussed the scheme and have expressed themselves in favour of the absorption of disabled men. They already have machinery for achieving this object, and have agreed to take back all men previously employed in the industry unless the disability is such as absolutely to preclude this. The Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Advisory Committee have passed a resolution recommending that the industry absorb their quota as trainees, and increased training facilities are being brought into existence for this purpose.The position, therefore, as regards the 23 main industries consulted may be summarised as follows. Eight industries have accepted the scheme in principle and expressed their willingness to take steps for the absorption of the 5 per cent, of disabled men, calculated on the total number of employees, which the Government scheme contemplates.  This* Eg., Mr. T. B. Johnston&apos;s scheme for the Pottery Trade, and the recent action by the Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturers&apos; Association referred to in Part IV. of this Report (see p. 187).
acceptance was, in a few cases, subject to the condition that the disabled men to be introduced should be considered suitable by the Local Technical Advisory Committees for the trade. Four industries, while accepting the scheme in principle, desired that the percentage should be reduced below 5 per cent, of the total employees, in one case to 2 per cent., in the second to 2$ per cent., in the third to 3 per cent., and in the fourth to 5 per cent, of the number of male employees. Five industries are not prepared to accept the introduction of 5 per cent, of disabled men, but have expressed their readiness to do their utmost for the absorption of these men provided that they were trained for the industry. Five industries have accepted the scheme in principle, but are unwilling to .state any percentage for possible absorption. The National Union of Railwaymen and the National Union of General Workers have expressed themselves in favour of the scheme. It is still under discussion with the Railway Executive Committee, and will be brought before the Agricultural Wages Board next week.Discussions with representatives of the unions covering women&apos;s labour show that general acquiescence in the scheme is probable. Much will necessarily depend on the position of the unskilled unions, as the majority of men must necessarily be placed on unskilled work, and there is no intention of attempting the dilution of skilled labour.The Comrades of the Great War have promised full support to the scheme and the attitude of the Federation of Discharged and Disabled Soldiers and Sailors has been considerably modified in view of the bearing which the revised rate of alternative pensions will have on the wages clause.In view of the differences of opinion which these discussions revealed as to the advisability of introducing into Government contracts a clause similar to the Fair Wages Clause, whereby the acceptance of this scheme would be made compulsory on Government contractors, the opinion of the Labour Resettlement Committee has again been taken on this point. The same difference of opinion showed itself here, but the Committee decided by a considerable majority in favour of this measure of compulsion. The matter is still under deliberation.The scheme, in the meantime, has been made the subject of discussion by many of the Divisional Employment Councils and Local Employment Committees. The main point of disagreement disclosed by the deliberations of these bodies has been over the question of the wages to be paid when the disabled man is not able to earn the standard district rate. It is on this point that the Government scheme differs most widely from that put forward by the Rotherham Employment Committee upon which it is largely based. The Rotherham Committee suggested that if the disabled man failed to attain the standard wage the difference between his actual earnings and the standard rate should be made up by the employer and the Government contributing equally. The Government scheme, on the other hand, omits this provision and suggests that in ;such a case, which it is assumed will be exceptional, the Local Employment Committee, or if desired the Local Technical Advisory Committee for the industry, should be asked to advise as between the employer and the men&apos;s associations, as to the fairness of the rate of wages paid. The Employment Councils and Committees have been divided on this point. The Northern, North-Western, West Midlands, South-Western, Wales and London Councils, for example, have decided to support the Government scheme, and the South Midlands and pastern Councils have expressed themselves in disagreement with the Rotherham Committee&apos;s view. On the other hand, the Scottish. CJouncil have gone even beyond the Rotherham Committee by suggesting that the whole of the difference between a disabled man&apos;s earning capacity and the standard rate should be made a charge upon the State alone. Representatives of the National Federation of Discharged and Disabled Sailors and Soldiers expressed a similar opinion at a meeting of the Labour Resettlement Committee early in July. The Yorkshire and East Midlands Council have put forward an alternative suggestion, in view of their belief that the scheme will not be successful unless provision is made for an allowance to bring the disabled man&apos;s income,.inclusive of his pension, up to the standard rate. Their proposal is that the Eni-ployment Committee should in the first place consider whether the wage offered Was fair ; if so, that they should then take into consideration the man&apos;s pension and authorise, if necessary, such an allowance as would bring the total income up to the standard rate. In consequence of the part which Rotherham Employment Committee have played in this matter, it is likely that a good deal of importance will be attached by their fellow-committees to the attitude which they adopt towards the Governments modification of their proposals. The Committee were originally inclined, to press strongly for the accep-tance of their scheme in toto, and failing this, asked that a deputation should be received by the Prime Minister, promising to abide by his advice on the point at issue. In view of the urgent necessity for the immediate introduction of a scheme they have recently
&quot;withdrawn from this attitude and will not offer any opposition. They do not, however, intend to let their original proposal lapse, but are taking steps to carry on negotiations with other Employment Committees in its favour. 1 .  ,Something may be done in certain directions to assist the disabled by the establish-ment of Government Factories giving direct employment. In this connection it may be noted that both employers and employed, in the boot and shoe industry, have pressed the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Munitions to establish a factory for the production of boots required by the Government for their owd purposes, and to staff it entirely with disabled men. Of, course even if such a scheme met with the most favourable acceptance, there must remain a certain residue of men who would be unemployable owing to the peculiarities of their physical disabilities. An inquiry is being conducted to ascertain the probable number of these men. The Government have already anticipated that it may be necessary for them to create direct employment for very badly disfigured men, and the Ministry of Pensions is dealing with this responsibility.Part III.-Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Imperial and Foreign.Hungary.&quot; The Call &quot; declares that it will be &quot; a terrible ironv &quot; if French and British workers stand passively by and allow Bela Kun to be tried by his capitalist enemies. The writer of &quot;Socialist War Points&quot; in &quot;Forward&quot; protests against the assertion of the &quot; New Europe &quot; that the Hungarians made an unprovoked attack on the Czecho-Slovaks, On another page of the same paper &quot; Rob Roy &quot; &quot;discusses the position in a more temperate spirit, and by comparing information from various quarters comes to the conclusion that Bela Kun&apos;s Government was not representative and only held its own by means of bribery and militarism. Moreover, he does not take a favourable view of Bela Kun&apos;s dealings with the Allies, and points out that as we are still technically at war with Hungary, there is no justification for the charge of &quot; attacks on an independent Socialist Republic.&quot;Russia.&quot; The Nation &quot; states that the summer campaign against Soviet Russia is developing its full violence in a renewed effort to take Petrograd. It seems to consider that Admiral Koltchak is finally discredited by the reports of two American Ambassadors, Dr. Reinsch and Mr. Roland Morris, who both comment adversely on his character as a reactionary and a monarchist. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; draws attention to the fact that the announce-. ment of the Naval engagement in the Baltic followed immediately upon a pledge given in the House that intervention in Russia would cease. It suggests that a new campaign against Russia in which the British Navy will play a large part is being organised by the Government under cover of a deliberate lie, and that such a piece of &quot;. cynical audacity &quot; renders futile all talk of adherence to constitutional action; The &quot; Call&quot; declares that no reinforcements are necessary to effect the withdrawal of British troops from Russia as this could be accomplished immediately by making peace with the Soviet Government on the basis of economic and political self-determination. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; also alludes to this, and remarks &quot; If we did not know we might be forgiven for assuming that several parts of our Russian policy were determined by several unco-ordinated departments completely out of touch with one another.&quot; .International Conferences.&quot; Justice &quot; contains an account of the proceedings of the Lucerne Conference, the reports of which it states were everywhere very incomplete. In the &quot; Democrat&quot; Mi. W. A. Appleton, writing on the Amsterdam Conference, urges that Germany should now be admitted on equal, terms to such meetings. He appears to have been impressed by the docility of the German delegates at Amsterdam; and states that there was no,attempt ;on their part to dominate the Conference. If Germany is to meet her financial liabilities it is imperative that she should be allowed to develop her industrial life unhampered by needless interference, which ultimately would only react upon other countries.*&apos;. * It is to be noted in this connection that the decision at Amsterdam, while embarassing to the Governments promoting the Washington Conference has been at least as embarassing in its possible results to the promoters of the International Federation, since it is conceivable that it might end in splitting this body so laboriously got together again into two camps.
In the same article the resolution of the Congress dealing with the nature and status of labour representation at the International Labour Conference at Washington is fully quoted, and the hope is expressed that the difficulties created by the attitude of the Trade Unions will be removed in time to ensure the success of the Conference.The Third International.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; published a manifesto on the Peace Treaty issued by the Moscow Communist International. The statement&apos; comprises a whole hearted denunciation-tion of the Peace as a product of rampant Imperialism, and an appeal to the workers of all countries to combine with the Communists and overthrow the Capitalist Governments of Europe.It also publishes an appeal from Klara Zetkin to socialist women on behalf of the Women&apos;s International Socialist League of which she is the Secretary. In it she calls for an international Women&apos;s Conference to be held as soon as is possible in Switzerland.In his notes to &quot; Forward,&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald attempts to define the nature of the cleavage between the Second and the Third International. He maintains that although this is fundamental, the need for unity in the World Socialist movement is imperative; the continual splits and differences play straight into the hands of reactionary groups in every country. In distinguishing the policy of the second from the Communist Interha-tional, lie is careful to give a due amount of praise to the latter. It has the merit of being direct, and the work accomplished by the Communist Governments is excellent. Socialist Governments on the other hand are weak and invariably tend to involve themselves with the old order. But the methods of the Communist parties while in power have been violent and brutal, and often unscrupulous. Their absolute conviction of their own &quot; Tightness &quot; permits them to use any means to gain their ends, and they recognise no demands of humanity. Mr. Macdonald, who has a great respect for the opinion of Friedrich Adler, gives an account of his interview with the latter who attended the Third International, and who &quot; belongs essentially to the Left.&quot; Adler declared that a Com-munist Revolution in. Austria could only end in reaction, and that the principal need of the moment was for all forces of the Socialists to keep together and show a united front. This unity, the article goes on to point out, is equally vital in the movement as a whole, and is threatened by extremists of both kinds, those in the Second International who can think of nothing but humiliating Germany, equally with those in the Third who permit excesses of violence, and invite the disruption of the movement instead of promoting unity by the necessary degree of compromise.India.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; has an account of an interview with Mr. Wadia, President of the Madras Labour Union, who is visiting the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Com-mittee of the Trades Union Congress as the fraternal delegate of the five Trade Unions in Madras. Mr. Wadia described the. progress of the Trade Union movement in Madras which he inaugurated about eighteen months ago. He particularly desires the support and assistance of the Labour Movement in England, and suggested the sending of an independent Commission established by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress to investigate conditions in India and report on them. He is convinced that the statements of such a Commission on the appalling industrial conditions would create an. irresistible demand by the British public for the improvement of the workers&apos; position in India, which would not be produced by any investigation undertaken, by the authorities.In &quot; Justice &quot; appears the resolution on India passed at the Second Annual Conference of the National Socialist Party, demanding the emancipation of India from British domina-tion at an early date&apos;. The resolution was moved by Mr. Hyndman, who spoke mainly on the lines of his article in last week&apos;s &quot; Justice.&quot;Other.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; has an article on the industrial situation in America. &apos; In this it is. maintained that the outlook is a serious one, and that more widespread disturbance-bances than exist at present are likely to occur in different industries, and a national labour crisis is predicted as the outcome of the war. It is held quite probable that a political Labour Party will have emerged before the next Presidential nominations ; but the main reason given for the approaching crisis is the alteration in the balance of power in the American industrial world brought about by the War. The shortage of Labour, the high rates of wages, and the decrease in the number of immigrants are all helping to put the workers in a very strong position.  Both the &quot;Nation&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;
(B) Home Affairs.The Prime Ministers Speech.The Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the 18th inst., is naturally dealt with in leading articles in most of the papers. It is heavily criticised as being lacking in vision. &quot;The Call&quot; describes it as &quot;pure commercialism,&quot; and, in company with the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and other journals points out the absence of any attempt at a. constructive policy with regard to Russia, Ireland, and Hungary. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; regards the speech as an indication that the Premier has abandoned all thought of adopting a bold programme of Social Reconstruction, and that he is now thinking of &quot; jumping off, when the time comes, heavily to the right.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; declares that &quot; not a gleam of a true appreciation of the seriousness of the position, not a hint of any constructive proposals for dealing with it, illuminated the verbiage of his three hours&apos; oratorical effort.&quot; The Coalition Government was formed on the understanding that it dealt with the problems of reconstruction. The Premier&apos;s speech is a confession of its failure to fulfil its promises. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the same paper, considers the speech to be an act of. political suicide, and states that it has made an early genera) election not only probable, but necessary. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; is equally emphatic. Most of the papers express particular disappointment with regard to the Premiers pronouncements on the nationalisa-tion. of the mines. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; prophesies that &quot; this decision will arouse general antagonism among the miners, and will aggravate the unrest and disaffection which are having such a disastrous effect upon the working of the industry.&quot; The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; states that his rejection of nationalisation was the only point on which: the Prime Minister was definite, and in this, as might have been expected, he is endeavouring to maintain the old order of things. &quot; The Worker &quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; are indignant at the use of the Yorkshire miners&apos; strike as an argument against nationalisation. The &quot; Democrat,&quot; on the other hand, is more distressed because the community&apos;s rights against the sectional rights put forward by the miners were not sufficiently emphasised. This paper rejoices at the approaching liberation of capital. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; expresses approval of the speech which it describes as &quot; spacious and the most notable event of the week.&quot; It considers that the reasons given against nationalisation are difficult to refute, and implies that although opposition may be aroused amongst extremists such opposition is negligible. Several papers, particularly &quot; The Nation,&quot; are disppointed with the Premier&apos;s statements with regard to trade and industry. &quot;Justice &quot; is par-ticularly gloomy, and in an article entitled, &quot; The Pale Horseman,&quot; predicts that Britain will find herself in the clutch of famine unless her people awake to a sense of their danger.Profiteering.The &quot; British Citizen &quot; is the only Labour paper which expresses much satisfaction with the passing of the Profiteering Bill. It considers that &quot; the measure was changed from &quot;its original form into a very satisfactory shape,&quot; and approves of the amendment which gives the Board of Trade the power to fix a maximum price. Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; declares that everything connected with the Bill &quot; takes more of the nature of a burlesque than of serious legislation,&quot; and that &quot; it is an utterly un-workable measure,&quot; which will have no good results except perhaps that it will discourage profiteering in its more outrageous forms. Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the same paper, describes the definition of profiteering given by the President of the Board of Trade as &quot;question-begging.&quot; He says that the anomalies of our present commercial system preclude the framing of a just and reasonable law. Nevertheless, it is a step in advance that public opinion should have set itself against profiteering for the restriction of profits will lead to the downfall of the capitalist system, and the aim of the peoples should be to establish Industrial Democracy in its place. In conclusion, he expresses the hope that the municipal trading clause of the Profiteering Bill will prove to be one of its most usefulconsider that Mr. Wilson made some rather damaging admissions at the Conference with the Foreign Relations Committee. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; contains Part III of its account of the Winnipeg Strike. It deals this week with the arrest of the Strike leaders, and an attack on the demobilised soldiers who supported the strike by mounted police and military. It also has an article describing the Italian &quot; Camera del Lavoro,&quot; which it describes as the &quot; Soviets &quot; of the future, and which played an important part in various Italian centres during the recent food riots. The &quot; Nation,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; agree in denouncing the agreement Avith Persia which is said to reduce Persia to the level of Egypt, and to be merely a fresh instance of imperialistic greed.
features, and that it will be very largely adopted. The &quot;New. Age&quot; is as emphatic as-usual on the evils of our present system of distribution. It asserts that the House of Commons which has passed the Bill, has no belief in it as a check to profiteering, and that it is not to the interest of the Government to find an effective remedy. Increased production will avail nothing, will, in fact, lead, to a decline in the level of living for the working classes. Councillor J. Jones, M.P., writes in &quot; Justice &quot; that &quot; the Anti-Profiteer^ ing Bill, as originally introduced, was a splendid example of the policy of those, who want to keep things as much as possible as they are whilst professing a keen desire to change them radically.&quot;Nationalisation.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; devotes a special article to the Government scheme for the future of the mines as outlined in the Prime Ministers speech. The article emphasises the gravity of the question of output, and the points in the scheme chosen for criticism are those which the writer thinks will tend to hamper rather than to promote an immediate and effective increase in the output of coal The scheme as it stands will not please any party concerned. A suggestion is thrown out that the scheme is not intended for an Act of Parliament, but as part of the paraphernalia of a General Election in the autumn, the result of which may admit the statement that the country has rejected Nationalisation, without requiring the putting into force of this particular substitute.The &quot; Democrat &quot; contains an article against Nationalisation in general on the grounds that State Control cannot be truly democratic because it involves a system of centralisation opposed to all democratic principles, that it is rarely intelligent, and inevitably dictated by policy rather than by the interests of the industry and the public.Mr. James Winstone, Chairman of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, contributes-an article on the Coal Commission to the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; in which he sets out to show to the Consumer the true facts with regard to the Commission. He lays particular stress on the &quot; safety &quot;aspect, and on the practical nature of the Miners&apos; Federation Scheme, considered from the point of view of the Consumer, who will naturally assume that the prime necessity is the certainty of an adequate supply of coal at a reasonable price. The writer Urges that this is far less likely to be achieved if the industry gets into the hands of a great trust, than if the Control of the Workers is increased in the measure demanded by the Miners&apos; Federation.The Industrial Outlook.The &quot; Nation,&quot; in a special article on the need for a comprehensive National Labour Programme, expresses the view that the economic and industrial situation is&apos; extremely grave. It is urged that neither the Government, nor the Employers, nor the Trade Union Leaders have grasped the fact that the only alternative to a bold scheme of some sort worked out by common effort is a period -of devastating struggle. Such schemes have been worked out for different industries, e.g., for the mines and railways by the Trade Unions concerned, but a co-ordinating body is necessary to obtain&apos;a set of really national, proposals. The article suggests that the Triple Alliance might undertake this work of co-ordination and that the forthcoming Trades Union Congress might appoint a Committee to draft the national programme. It conceives the sectionalism and divisions among the labour groups themselves rather than the quarrel between Labour and Capital as the chief stumbling block to the formulation and realisation of an effective scheme, and points the moral that while such a spirit exists Labour will never be competent to exercise the effective share of control in industry which it is now demanding.The Political Outlook.  .        . JColonel Wedgwood, writing in the.&quot; Labour Leader,&quot; discusses the need for a con-structive Independent Labour Party policy, in order that a future Labour Government will consist not of,any collection of Labour politicians but of those with a clearly defined plan and with leaders of the calibre of Ramsay Macdonald, Philip Snowden and the other banished Independent Labour Party chiefs. To get these leaders back into the House of Commons is the first step, since a Labour Government uncontrolled by the Independent Labour Party will be equivalent to a Conservative one* The attractions to take a moderate line once safely in the House are very great, and the shades of opinion in the Parliamentary Labour Party vary from temperament or from the inability to resist this attraction. It is therefore urgent that power should be placed in the hands of the incorruptible radical wing, so that their influence may be the predominating one when the whole administration becomes the business of Labour.
Part IV. General Topics and District Reports. (1) General Topics.Nationalisation.There seems to be every prospect that the question of nationalisation will very soon emerge again into full prominence. A special conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain is to be held in London on the 3rd of September, in order to consider the situation created by the announcement of the Governments policy with regard to the nationalisation of the coalmines.- This conference will be followed on the next day by a full delegate conference of the Triple Alliance, which has been called to consider the decision of the Executive in postponing the ballot on Direct Action. It appears probable that no serious attempt will be made by this conference to resuscitate the Direct Action policy, on the original issues; but it seems certain that strong efforts will be made to obtain the support of the whole strength of the Alliance for the nationalisation of the mines, and direct action in favour of this has already been suggested in some quarters. Mr. Smillie has freely stated that the miners intend to make nationalisation the test for organised labour, and he has pointed out that trades which are closely concerned in the welfare of the coal-mining industry have everything/to gain by interesting themselves in trie successful result of the miners&apos; demand. Most of the miners&apos; leaders have protested against the Government policy, and the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Council at Chesterfield ore the 23rd inst. unanimously passed a resolution protesting against the Governments decision not to nationalise the mines as a distinct breach of faith, and pledging themselves to use every means in their power, both industrially and politically, to defeat the Government scheme of trusts in the coal trade.Other.Most of the papers comment on the case of W. F. Watson. There is some difference of opinion as to the truth of the charges against him, but common cause is made against the Government for sanctioning the existence of a.pernicious &quot;spy&quot; system. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which has always been a staunch supporter of Watson, states that nothing can be done until his release from prison, when he will doubtless prove capable of defending himself. A writer in &quot; Forward &quot; deals with a recent article in the &quot; Times Literary Supplement&quot; on the respective merits of Parliaments and Soviets as alternative systems of representation. The decision of the Triple Alliance with regard to Direct Action is dealt with in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The policy of abandoning the ballot is declared to be undoubtedly &quot;wise in the circumstances &quot; and an indication of the &quot; Collapse of a movement whioh from the beginning has been badly mismanaged.&quot; The absolute solidarity of the workers, combined with rapid and definite action, are essential to the success of Direct Action. An answer is made to Mr. Clynes and other opponents of the theory of Direct Action on the grounds that since by no stretch of imagination can the existing Government be called a constitutional one, and since small sections of the community who possess industrial power do actually use the method &quot; on the backstairs &quot; it is legitimate for the workers to use their industrial power in the form in which it is most effective. Mr. Fred Shaw writes on the same subject in the &quot; Hudders-field Worker.&quot; He deprecates exaggeration of the distinction between political and industrial action. Both are part of the means which Labour organisations use and are urged to use as a method of creating social strain and leading to a deadlock. A special article in the &quot;Democrat&quot; outlines a scheme of Federalism in industry based on the Whitley Report as an antidote to Direct Action.-(2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Ex-Soldiers and Unemployment.The &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; 22nd and 23rd inst., contains special articles on the. position of the ex-soldiers. The first is taken up with a criticism of the Appointments Department and the Employment Exchanges, and the second urges the men in the face of the utter failure of official attempts to relieve their position to organise politically and get into line with the Labour Party as the only hope of obtaining redress.
Railway Employees.As the result of the negotiations mentioned in last week&apos;s report, the agreement reached between officials of the railway unions and representatives of the Government on the 20th inst. was after some hesitation ratified by the N.U.R. on the 21st and by the A.S.L.E.F. on the 22nd inst. At a conference between the Railway Executive Committee and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association1 on the 22nd inst., terms were reached which the Association was able to recommend to its members for acceptance.High Prices and Profiteering.It is reported that in Labour circles two main objections to the Profiteering Act are being advanced. It is feared that the small trader will be victimised, and that trusts and monopolies will escape ; and that vested interests will secure strong representation on local tribunals.It is stated that open markets are now provided at Ilford, Seven Kings, Southgate, Hounslow, Egham, Wealdstone and Oxford. Much opposition to the stallholders is evinced by shopkeepers, who point out that the former pay no rent, rates nor taxes, and are therefore able to sell at lower prices.Russia.The Glasgow District Committee of the A.S.E. has passed a series of resolutions dealing with the &quot; war against Russia,&quot;, and demanding (1) the immediate withdrawal of all troops and material &quot; without any manoeuvring by generals,&quot; (2) that the Executive should instruct all sea-going members not to sail in ships bearing munitions to Russia, (3) that the Executive should assure the Triple Alliance of the support of the Society in a Direct Action movement. Protests against the &quot; Russian War &quot; have also been made by a meeting of ex-Service men&apos;s organisations at Caxton Hall, by the quarterly meeting of the Liverpool branch of the N.E.D.D.S.S., and by mass meetings of railwaymen and general workers at Southend.Electrical Trades Union.The new programme formulated at the district delegates&apos; conference of the Electrical Trades Union at Birmingham includes a demand for a minimum basis rate of  6 for a 47-hour week, and the repudiation of the national agreement for a four-monthly review of wages. The question of closer unity with the engineering trade unions is being con-sidered..Union Officials&apos; Pay.A claim for increase in pay is contained in the current report of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders. The full-time officials of the Society refer to their economic position, and state that owing to the increased cost of food, clothing and other essentials they consider that they are justified in asking for an advance of 20s. per week, and for the consolidation of war advances as permanent wages.The llorbury Strike.As much controversy has arisen with regard to the strike at Messrs. C. Roberts &amp; &apos;Co.&apos;s Railway Wagon Works, Horbury, it seems worth while to give a summary of the facts of the case.The strike began on the 30th June owing to the refusal of members of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Vehicle Workers to work with fourteen discharged soldiers who had recently been taken on by the firm.Since last March the firm had been anxious to employ extra men, and states that it wrote continually to the Society of Railway Vehicle Workers offering to employ men on their unemployment register. The Society was unable to supply the firm, having no members unemployed at the time. In spite of this, however, it showed great hostility to the proposed introduction of unemployed discharged soldiers who did not belong to the Union, although the firm guaranteed to pay these men the standard Trade Union rate for a 44-hour week. In view of this hostility, a meeting was held at the works on the 22nd May at which representatives of certain ex-Service men&apos;s organisations and the firm&apos;s trade union committee were present. No solution of the problem could be reached, a member of the A.S.E. pointing out that his society had already prepared a scheme for the employment of discharged soldiers, but as the Ministry of Labour had taken no action
to meet his Society, the trade unionists could not agree to discharged soldiers being, employed until the matter was put on a proper footing. The firm addressed several appeals to the.Ministry of Labour for advice on the subject, but asserts that it received no satisfactory replies. Finally, on the 24th June, the firm, not having received any applicants from the Vehicle Workers&apos; Society, introduced fourteen discharged men, with the result that a strike was declared.In spite of the fact that the Society was unable to supply unemployed members to-the firm, it has stated that the strike occurred because &quot; the state of the trade did not warrant&quot; the introduction of the discharged men. The only justification to be found for this attitude appears to be the fact that it is endeavouring to protect the interests o  its members who are still in the army ; for at a meeting of the Reconstruction Committee on the 2nd July, the Society&apos;s representatives are reported to have anticipated a shortage of work for its 500 to 600 members as yet undemobilised.On the intervention of Mr. G. J. Wardle, representing the Ministry of Labour, it was agreed on the 7th August that a court of inquiry should be established to decide whether the ex-Service men should be withdrawn pending a national conference to con-sider the whole question on a national basis; this court is. to consist of an independent chairman appointed by the Ministry of Labour and two arbitrators appointed by the employers and workmen respectively.* Police. /As was stated in last week&apos;s Report, Labour in general has definitely declined to support the Police strikers. A certain amount of sympathy has, indeed, been manifested with strikers who were long in the.force, and it is this feeling which has been mainly responsible for the expressions of sympathy and promises of support that have been made. It may be interesting to note that promises of support have been given by, among others, the following associations : Oxford branch of the A.S.L.E. &amp; F., Neasden (No. 1) branch of the N.U.R., Birmingham (No. 5) branch of the N.U.R., Wandsworth branch of the National Union of General Workers, London District Committee of the Society of Amalgamated Toolmakers, Finchley branch of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, Woolwich Labour Party, Birmingham Postal branch of the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association, and Birmingham, Cambridge, Workington, Hendon and Kingston and District Trades Councils. Small subscriptions, noted in &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; are being contributed by various Trade Unions and local branches to the funds of the Police Union.Ex-Service Men.At a meeting of representatives of various ex-Service men&apos;s organisations held on the 23rd inst. in the Caxton Hall, the question of obtaining back pay at the Colonial rate was discussed. One of the speakers urged the necessity of political or even &quot;direct&quot; action, in order to render this demand effective. It was decided to form a Back Pay Committee, and to forward the proceedings of the Committee to the Trade. Union Congress in Glasgow, with an appeal for its support.It is stated that a number of ex-Service men in the Leeds district are seceding from their societies, on the ground that they are disgusted with the men who control the organisations. The National Union of Ex-Service Men, which has now taken over &quot; The New World &quot; (formerly the organ of the International Union of Ex-Service Men), is extending its activities, and has apparently established a close connection with the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;Women in Industry.The Executive of the N.U.R. has considered an application from the Covent Garden Branch on the question of equal pay for women, and having noted that the principle of equal pay for equal work had been admitted by the Royal Commission, instructed the General Secretary to take up with the Government and the R.E.C., &quot; with a view to the Governments pledges being fuLulled,&quot; the application of the principle of equal pay to the women members of the N.U.R.It is stated that as a result of the representations made by a deputation from the Portsmouth Branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S., the Admiralty will take steps at once to replace non-dependent women workers by disabled men. The Minister of Labour, in reply to a resolution of the East Ham Branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S., protesting.against the con-tinued employment of female labour in Government Departments, and calling on the Ministry to substitute disabled Service men for the women so employed, has addressed a letter to the branch stating that the Committee appointed to investigate the matter
lias reported, and that its report is now under consideration by the Government. It is lioped that effect will shortly be given to the proposal contained in the report, and that thereafter there will be no further cause for complaint. The Maidstone Tramways Com-mittee has declined to accede to the suggestion of local demobilised sailors and soldiers that they should replace the present women conductors by ex-Service men..  ..&apos; - - &apos; *Trade Union Topics.The membership of the National Union of General Workers now stands at 454,975, find is stated to have increased by 30,562 in the June quarter.A National Union of Bookshop and Bookstall Employees has been formed.Income Tax.A special conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, at Cardiff on the 26th rejected by a very large majority the recommendation of the Executive Council that, having regard to the increase in the income-tax abatement in the finance Act, sectional action on the demand for  250 abatement was inadvisable, but that the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain be urged vigorously to press for this abatement.American Steel Worlcers Union.An interesting programme is being formulated by this organisation.,. It consists of twelve fundamental demands which comprise: The right of collective bargaining, the reinstatement of all men discharged for union activities with pay. for lost time, an 8-hour day, one day&apos;s rest in seven,,the abolition of 24-hour shifts, increases in wages sufficient to guarantee the American standard of living, standard scales of wages for all crafts and classifications of workers, double rates of pay for all overtime work, the introduction of the oheck-off system, the right to collect union dues and assessments, the principles of seniority to apply in maintaining, reducing, or increasing working forces, the abolition of the com-pany unions, and the abolition of the physical examination of applicants for employment.Court of Arbitration.During the week ended the 23rd August, 19.19, the Court of Arbitration heard 19 cases in London.Joint Industrial Councils.Furniture. A meeting of the Council was held on the 13th August. It was explained at the outset that the originating cause of the meeting was the desire of the Department to ascertain whether the Industrial Council were prepared to deal with the present situation in the Furniture Trade with a view to bringing the strikes and lock-outs to an end. A resolution was passed instructing the Acting Secretary to inform the Minister that the Council are dealing with the present situation with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution. It was subsequently decided, to summon a Conference of the Employers and Operatives in all centres where both the National Federation of Furniture Manufacturers and the Furniture Trade Unions are represented. The meeting was very satisfactory as it indicated a disposition.on both sides to regard the Council as a kind of independent and permanent entity, the continuity of which was not affected by.the existence of un-reconciled disputes between the organisations represented on it.Local Authorities Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers). The Paddington Borough Council (which has declined to carry out the recommendations of the Joint Industrial Council) has adopted a resolution to the effect that the Joint Industrial Council constitute the City and Metropolitan Boroughs&apos; Joint Standing Industrial Council an Advisory Com-mittee on all questions relating to London Municipal Labour, and that the Metropolitan City and Borough Councils be urged to support the resolution with a view to establishing uniformity of municipal labour conditions in the Metropolis.The Westminster City Council has informed the Ministry of Labour that as it is not directly represented on the Joint Industrial Council it does not consider itself bound by the decisions of the Joint Industrial Council. It has adopted certain of the recommenda-tions of the Joint Industrial Council, but this is not to be regarded as a precedent. The Westminster City Council is also strongly of opinion that, having regard to the number of Borough Councils in the Metropolitan area and to the large number of workmen employed by them, the Metropolitan Borough Councils are entitled to representation on the Joint Industrial Council and should be represented thereon either directly, or through the Metropolitan Borbugh&apos;s Standing Joint Committee.
(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The live register has fallen by nearly 2,900 in the week, making a total reduction of over 20,000 in the last six weeks.Resettlement. -Transport difficulties continue. The South-Eastern and Chatham Railway Company are equipping engineering workshops at Richborough for repair work: it is stated that between 2,000 and 3,000 railway wagons and from 500 to 600 locomotives from France are awaiting repair in this centre. Delays in the supply of machinery and machine tools are stated to be hindering the work, and a shortage of labour also exists. An impression prevails that the military authorities are not sufficiently alive to the importance of the work.In the building trades, a serious shortage of sand is reported at Gravesend, and of white lead, glass and other material at Folkestone and Worthing. In the last named ^districts skilled labour is short, and the excessive cost of all materials is stated to be retarding progress.Work at a new colliery at Chislet is progressing, and output is expected to begin at the end of September. Preparations are on foot for building 1,600 workmen&apos;s cottages, and the Stour is being widened near Sandwich to form a basin for barges serving the -colliery.A large glass bottle works is to be erected at Charlton at an estimated cost of  300,000, and other developments in this industry are on foot in view of the shortage of bottles.General. Nothing serious has arisen during the week and the few outstanding matters of dispute are likely to be the subject of arbitration and settlement at an early date.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment-A considerable decrease, amounting to over 1,700, has occurred in the live register.Resettlement. Complaints have been received of a shortage of fuel at Wellingborough, two iron firms being unable to obtain coke in adequate quantities, and a gas companies finding difficulty over the coal supply.  The problems of transport and housing persist.General. The position is quiet.  There is a movement afoot for the amalgamation . of all unions represented locally in the engineering foundry and allied trades, at Notting-ham, &apos;where the Joint Board in these trades has passed a resolution that no operatives should work overtime while there are so many men unemployed.South-Western.Unemployment.-A small decrease in the live register is reported, the latest returns showing a total of nearly 49,200.Resettlement. Employment in connection with the electric street lighting scheme of the Cheltenham authorities is retarded by the slow delivery of cable. The Bournemouth Tramways Co. have decided not to proceed with the work of relaying before the end of the year, steel track rails being stated only to be obtainable from America.Iron and Steel Wife Manufacturing.-The Executive Committee met on the 12th August and discussed the proposals to provide statistics of the trade for the information of the workpeople. It was finally decided that a letter should foe sent to all firms represented on the Council who are primarily engaged in wire drawing, asking them to make returns under the following headings: (1) Wages paid, (a) Those subject to National Insurance, (b) Wages and salaries not subject to National Insurance, including commissions. (2) Capital. (Assets minus liabilities. Debentures to be included in assets. Interest on debentures to be included in distribution of profits.) (3) Contributions to Insurance and state of local taxation. (4) Aggregate amount distributed as interest. (5) Taxed profits allocated to reserve and special de-preciations. (6) Board of Trade returns. (7) Tonnage of wire produce. (8) Total number of men employed in the industry. (9) Cost of coal. (10) Total cost of transport &quot; in and out.&quot; These figures are to be drawn up by Chartered Accountants. The Council has decided upon geographical districts for District Councils, and shows a great interest in the formation of Works Committees.
Good progress is being made with a housing scheme at Yeovil, 72 houses being under construction, which will greatly relieve the very acute housing problem in the town. At Bournemouth housing scheme sites are now laid out, and construction is expected to begin, without delay.General-The labour situation is in effect unaltered, and. remains quiet. With the exception of the Southampton joiners&apos; strike, where neither side seems anxious for in-tervention, reports are generally satisfactory.There is some fear of unemployment in Plymouth, on account of the discharge of dockyard workers. There is a movement in Plymouth in favour of an amalgamation of trade unions connected with shipbuilding.Satisfaction is being expressed in Exeter at what appears to be the re-opening of canal traffic.West Midlands.Unemployment. The persistent decline in unemployment continues, a decrease of nearly 3,000 being shown by the latest returns.   The number of juveniles on the live 1 register has fallen substantially, and those leaving school are now being rapidly absorbed into industry.Resettlement. The question of housing continues urgent; The Rugby Portland Cement Company owing to shortage of labour are producing only to 60 per cent, of their capacity, and the necessary labour could be obtained if accommodation were available.At Bilston, approximately 1,500 men employed by Messrs. Alfred Hickman, Ltd., on the basic Bessemer process have been suspended or discharged, and the firm are expecting to blow out two of their blast furnaces, which will involve 200 more men. The local tube works have derived 50 per cent, of their material from this firm, and the stoppages of the blast furnaces will seriously affect employment in the Oxford and Northampton ironstone mines. The firm state that owing to the cost of new materials and labour and to irregularity in the supply of coal and coke they cannot compete with American steel manufacturers.There is no improvement in the supply of trucks at Stourbridge,. which is seriously affecting the fireclay industry.County and other authorities in the area have received grants from the Road Board amounting to  766,000, including a sum of  100,000 for the City of Birmingham which will enable the authorities to proceed with their scheme of road renovation.General. A great deal of unrest of a varied character still prevails.Some attempt is being made by the unions to prohibit overtime altogether.In the strike of miners, now settled, which was of recent occurrence in the Walsall and Cannock districts, over a thousand of the men ceased work without official sanction. The fact that the cessation of work at the Dunlop Rubber Company&apos;s works originated among the largely unorganised rubber workers also indicates a tendency towards irregular: and unauthorised forms of protest.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The coal strike continues to add to unemployment in the division,, the live register for the 8th August standing at over 113,000 as against 97,500 on the 1st August. The area most heavily affected is the textile district with Bradford as its centre. Firms which had been compelled to shut down have in some cases managed to obtain a certain amount of fuel and to resume work, thus relieving the situation to some extent.Resettlement. Investigation confirms the existence of great congestion in the Hull-Docks, especially as regards timber. Ships are unable to discharge their cargo,( and demurrage at the rate of  100 a day must have an appreciable effect on timber prices. The position may shortly be eased to some extent, as more railway trucks are reported to have arrived.General-It is expected that the return of the miners to work will quickly have effect on the industrial position. Many works are re-starting, or actively preparing to do so, but there may, exceptionally, be some delay in Bradford where the proportion of the trades at present closed down is very high.Settlement has been effected in the disputes at Hull and at Lincoln. The determina-tion by the employers to replace strikers by non-union men is likely to end the stoppage at the works of the Campbell Gas Engine Company, Ltd., Halifax.
Scotland.Unemployment. There has been a further small decrease in unemployment. Rises in a number of areas are due mainly to temporary causes such&apos;as the breakdown of machinery. There is considerable unemployment among vanmen, warehousemen and general labourers in Edinburgh. In Paisley and Clydebank there is unemployment among shipyard workers, and in the former area and in Kirkcaldy the textile trades are slack. In Perth unemployment exists mainly among women and girls formerly employed by the Army Pay Office and unwilling to accept other than clerical work. The dyeing and bleach-ing firms are continually short of women workers and are willing to pay good wages to the unskilled during training.Resettlement. In the Perth area, there are complaints of shortage of coal, bleaching powder and flax, as well as a lack of unskilled workers for dyeing and bleaching.. TheNorth-western.Unemployment. The latest weekly return shows a decrease of over 6,900 in the live register. Increases of some slight importance are recorded at Liverpool, Northwich and Warrington.Resettlement. Reports on the cotton industry in Wigan, Rawtenstall and Accrington show that the position is good. Several mills in Wigan are 11 gaiting up &quot; looms, but the work is retarded by a shortage of tacklers. Textile engineering firms in Accrington, silk firms in Macclesfield, and felt slipper and shoe manufacturers in Rawtenstall are stated to be very busy. The demand for the release of men who have become pivotal continues to be strongly pressed.The Accrington housing scheme is at a standstill, owing, it is alleged, to the insistence of the Ministry of Health on a garden city scheme involving a cost of  900 to  1,000 per house on a site difficult of access.General. The present, position is fairly quiet, with the exception of the trouble which is arising with the iron moulders and coremakers. There is a feeling in the district that -employers are eager for a fight and may regard this question as an opportunity to take action which might lead to a general stoppage in the engineering trades.Northern.Unemployment. The number of workers unemployed shows a decline of approximately 1,000. The position in Stockton, has improved materially owing to the re-employment of men by a large iron and steel works. In Middlesbrough, however, a considerable rise in unemployment mainly among iron and steel workers, is reported, and the iron and steel industry in the west of the division is giving rise to anxiety. Unemployment in this industry throughout the division has increased by over 6,000 in three weeks.Resettlement. A large firm have ceased to manufacture binder-twine owing to the unsettled state of the market, uncertainty as to the prospects of American importation, and American competition in colonial markets, especially in South Africa. Steel and hemp rope firms are hampered by the restrictions imposed on transport by rail.Extensions to a shipyard are in progress near West Hartlepool, and a new shipyard is being established near the same town at Seaton Snook. Wiredrawing firms at Gateshead and Darlington are extending their works, but shortage of housing accommodation in both places may hamper employment.General. The situation at present remains fairly satisfactory. Interest in the question of a 44-hour week has subsided partly owing to the announcement of fresh legislation for a maximum 48-hour week. Very little comment has been noted on the announcement of the Governments decision as to nationalisation of coal mines.It is regarded in this district that the action of the iron moulders and coremakers is of the nature of a feeler to discover how far they will be supported by the engineering trades.Considerable interest is being taken in the Governments scheme for training disabled ex-Service men, and a ballot is being taken among local members as to what amount of co-operation should be offered by the A.S.E. It is on the question of the time that men will have to serve in training that the chief interest is centred.
housing problem is also serious in this district. At Coatbridge the demand&apos; for puddlers and joiners largely exceeds the supply, and at Leith there is an unsatisfied demand for skilled workers and especially shipwrights and painters. The shortage of ironmoulders continues.Building operations in connection with housing schemes have commenced in Edinburgh and also in Airdrie, where, however, progress is slow owing to a shortage of cement.General.-Yh&amp; industrial situation maintains a satisfactory aspect.. Employers and workers alike appear to be anxious to resume normal working.Extensive propaganda is being conducted in favour of the proposed amalgamation of most of the large unions in the engineering trades.Wales.Unemployment. The latest returns show a decrease of over 2,000 in the number on. the live register. This is, however, considered to be due to the fact that workers in the Merthyr area from the works of the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron and Coal Company and of Messrs.. Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, have withdrawn their registrations on finding that they cannot claim out-of-work donation.Resettlement. There are few fresh developments to record. The drought has caused a cessation of night work at Cardiff Docks, and is affecting several steel and tinplate firms in the Llanelly area, where a large number of men will be rendered idle if a sufficient rainfall does not occur.The situation at the works of the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron and Coal Company and of Messrs. Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, remains unchanged. The former company are en-endeavouring to find employment on extensions to the works for the men involuntarily idle on account of the dispute.  Much short-time working will, however, be involved.General. There is a tendency to an increase in the number of minor disputes in this area. .The attitude of the Government towards the proposals for nationalisation of coal-mines has given extremists an opportunity to resume their activities, but the great majority of miners seem to be rather apathetic on the subject at present.Part V. Disputes. (a) Involving a stoppage of work.Building.A strike of painters and decorators occurred at Nuneaton on the 23rd inst.  The men? demand an extra penny per hour so as to bring their wages on a level with the bricklayers and carpenters.  The employers refuse to pay the increase and the strike threatens to spread to all, employees in the building trade.Coal Miners.Yorkshire. The men at the Frickley Colliery, who were demanding the dismissal of deputies: who had remained at work during the strike, resumed Work on the 21st inst.The deputies&apos; dispute, which caused a delay in the resumption of work in West Yorkshire,. has been settled, and an agreement has been reached concerning hours to be worked by deputies.Scotland,-The pits at the View Park Colliery, Uddingston, which had been closed since the 15th inst. owing to*a strike of officials, were opened again on the 25th, a new staff having been secured. The dispute between the dismissed manager and the company is in the hands of the Scottish Mine Managers&apos; Association and the Coal Controller.Engineers, etc&apos;.The trade unionists employed at the Campbell Gas Engine Company, Halifax, have been on strike since the 12th July, as a protest against the training of ex-soldiers &quot;in unduly large numbers.&quot; A notice has now been issued by the company inviting their workpeople who dis-approve of the strike to return by 1st September. If the men are expelled from their union in consequence, the firm offers to pay them benefits corresponding to those they will be for-feiting. On the 25th inst. the iron moulders employed at the firm withdrew their labour ink sympathy with the engineers.
(C 1873)Woodworkers, etc. -       .A conference between the representatives of the Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association: and the National Federation of Furniture Manufacturers began on the 27th inst; in connection with the lock-out.About 250 woodworkers employed at the Brush Electrical Engineering Works, Loughborough, ceased work on the 19th inst. as a protest against losing the \2\ per cent, bonus, which had been granted while they were engaged on aeroplane work. A strike is in progress at the &quot;Austin Motor Works, Northfield, owing to the re-introduction of the piece-work system in July without reference being made to the operatives or their representatives. The strike .    began on 16th July.On the 20th inst., a meeting of members of the National Association of Carpenters, Cabinet-makers and Joiners and the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists of Liverpool and Birkenhead district stated its willingness to send a deputation to the Master Builders&apos; Association on the basis of 2s. per hour and special overtime rates. All other questions in dispute will be discussed after the men have returned to work under these conditions.Electricians.The employees of the Epsom electricity works struck on the 22nd inst. owing to the dis-missal of one of their number on the ground that there was insufficient work for all the men to do. The men have decided to return to work on the 29th, although the Council refuses to re-employ the discharged man.Upholstery Workers,The Liverpool retail upholstery workers are reported to have arranged an agreement with the Master Builders&apos; Association as to wages, but a settlement is delayed owing to a refusal of the employees of one firm to resume work until a dispute affecting the firm&apos;s joiners has been concluded.  The upholsterers struck over two months ago for an advance to 2s. 2d. per hour.*Dunlop Rubber Workers.A strike, involving some 9,000, began on the 21st inst. at the Dunlop Rubber Company&apos;s works, Aston Cross, Birmingham. A section of the employees had recently submitted demands for special night work rates, and because these Were not immediately granted, had ceased work. The firm maintained that the demand was presented at short notice and had not been submitted through the proper channels, no communication being received from any Trade Union. It appears that the majority of the strikers are non-unionists; an appeal was made to the men &apos; on the part of the General Workers&apos; and Workers&apos; Unions to become trade unionists and to present this demand in a constitutional way.Co-operative Employees.The Co-operative dispute in the North of England was settled on the 24th inst. A confer-ence was held at Manchester between representatives of the A.U.C.E., the Federation of Hours, and Wages Board and the Manchester and Salford Trades Council which lasted for 24 hours.&quot; Besides substantial advances in Wages, the following terms were also included in the agreement: All war bonuses and war advances to be merged in a scale ; a 48-hour week, with a 40-hour week &apos;.     in offices, to be established ; and six days holiday after six months&apos; service.Agricultural Labourers.The strike of farm labourers in Kjldare ended on the 22nd inst.  The workers will receive from 32s. to 34s. a week and a harvest bonus of  3.  The strike began on the 23rd June in, support of a demand for 37s. per week.  The strike in Meath has also been settled.A strike occurred among the agricultural workers in Holbeach Marsh as a protest against the employment of Irish harvest men.

The employers declare that it is financially impossible for them to accept the conditions in the Sankey award ; the men&apos;s officials, however, want access to the employers&apos; . books in order to verify this statement. The situation is complicated by the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has recently offered to buy up the Scottish companies.*Ironfounders.The members of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders and the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers decided to accept the recommendation of the Manchester Joint National Con-ference and to remain at work until 13th September. The national strike for higher wages-which was due to begin on the 23rd inst. has therefore been postponed.Transport Workers.The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation recently applied for a weekly increase of 12s. for tramway employees over 18 years and 6s. for those under ; and for war bonuses to be merged into the permanent wages.

*Other.Representatives of the London branches of the National Union of Packing Case Makers* met the employers on the 26th inst. to discuss the demands recently put forward. The result was considered unsatisfactory from the workers&apos; point of view since the employers would only increase wages provided the workers undertook to increase production: it was also proposed that an employer should be allowed to introduce any approved output bonus system. These proposals were rejected at a meeting of workers on the 27th. It was agreed to present new wage proposals to the employers with the threat to strike on the 6th September unless they were granted.* See Report for August 13th, p. 150.R. S.
