Much interest is evinced, however, in the impending Trade Union Congress, whioh will meet at Glasgow on September 8th and, as the Parliament of Labour, is expected to give the lead on all outstanding problems.    Against this may be set the fact that the approaching football season is already influencing the minds of the workers and stould greatly reduce the attendance at meetings.The result of the recent publicity in the press has been to depress the spirits of the revolutionaries.    They consider that they have lost ground during the past nine months.    (Kiere is certainly a reaction against those who advocate Soviet Government on the Russian model.I        The principal causes of unrest continue to lie in the housing, profiteering and nationalisation questions.i The Labour leaders and the party organisations are devotingI   their energies to canvassing at parliamentary and munioipal bye-electionsSpecial attention is called to the paragraph dealing with delay of perishable food at the dooks.

THE POLICETha police strikers in London are now concentrating upon the acquisition of funds.   The &quot;Daily Heralft11 of August 21st announced that it had he en asked to&apos; open a fund but had to refuse, as there was; a role against appealing !      for sectional funds.  The demonstrations at Tower Hill now seem to attract with difficulty an audience of 300f and when the hat was passed round on August 23rd, the collection amounted to just monster  1.While the Cardiff Police have resigned from tba Union en bloc, the local Trades and labour Councils continue to pass resolutions in support of the strikers.   The majority of Trades Unionists in Liverpool are said to be out of * sympathy with the Police strikers/ but in Birmingham the gttestion of reinstatement is still being discussed.There is an echo of the Police Strike in Holland, where the Rotterdam Police are paid less than the men at Amsterdam.   It is stated that there might have been a strike, had it hot been for the example of the abortire stride in England.There is a movement tc bring all the Police forces in Holland under Government control.THE) HOUSING QUESTION ^ Tf&apos;&apos;The unrest caused by scarcity Qf houses shows no abatement.  Nevertheless, the delegates to the Special Congress on Housing, held at Glasgow on August 23rd, roared g  W the fnfe. Snion Congrea.Ito region in regard to the arrangement of a national strike as a protest against the dilatory handling of the problem by the Government.THE .HAT.IQKALIZATION OF THE COAL MINES &quot;JWhile opinion among the miners is not unanimouslyin/
1* -J(English.),     .1m flavour of. the- riatiomlization of the ooal nines, the question is paramount at present in the labour world.  The meeting of the Executive Committee of the Miners1 Federation on August 29th may very possibly be followed by a national conference of delegates.   In any oase the controversy will form an outstanding feature of the programme at the forthcoming annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress. In view of the innumerable resolutions on nationalisation which have been passed by Trades Unions during the last forty years, there seems little doubt that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress will be given a mandate to force the hand of the Government *Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that although mass demonstrations in favour of nationalisation have been held during the week: at Sheffield and Clackheaton, the Nottingham miners are waiting for a lead from their federation and in North Staffordshire the miners, while approving of the nationalization of royalties, are not, as a whole, anxious for complete nationalisation.FOOD SUPPLIES FROM AMERICAMr. Foley, who represents Mr. Hoover in this oountry, was about to report to the American Food Controller on the question of future shipments of American apples and other perishables&apos;, in view of the congestion at the docks, but at the instance of the American Ambassador he has withheld his report in the hope that some action may be taken in this country.  His oase is this:  Amerioan shippers send over one million oases of apples, as well as bacon and other perishables; the distributing centres are Edinburgh, Glasgow and Lancashire (supplied hy Liverpool), and theSouth/
v ** 3 &quot;*South of England (supplied &quot;by London).   Owing to short hours, Slacking1, or mismanagement, perishable  qod is so delayed at the ports that much of it is wasted; the fruit comes over in passenger ships in cold storage, and it must be in the hands of the consumer immediately, otherwise (like all cold storage fruit) it perishes rapidly.This year the American market can take all its apples.He gaye an instance of waste;   La3t week an American ship named the &quot;Eage!J.wood&quot; was mined off the Thames; she was brought in in a sinking condition by two tugs; the cargo might have been saved if the men had worked overtime, but they refused.  He gave numerous instances of food lying about in the Liverpool Docks until it was wasted, and said that, if this were known in America the food shippers, instead of buying their fruit at the farms and sending it to auction in England at their own expense, would only sell to British importers in America and let them take all the risks.   This would mean drawing on the banks for capital which might be otherwise employed.Two immediate remedies might be applied.   First, that the dock and railway authorities should undertake to give priority to perishable food.   Second, that an appeal should be made to the Dockers1 &quot;Onion leaders to use their influence in having any trades union rule that interferes with overtime in the matter of perishable food set aside,PORggCOMm BSB-BKBOSIOHSLabour is using every possible means to secure the return of Mir.

He has put nationalisation li 1 the forefront of his programme.   Tho meetings of the Coalition candidate are reported to be stormy.   This be due to the current rumour that he and his father have been guilty of &quot;sweating&quot; and of employing non-Union labTRADE UNION FUNDSSome indication of the financial stability of the 1) Trade Unions is given by the annual -financial report of Amalgamated Society of Engineers for 1918.At the end of 1918, the total funds invested or returned from branches aggregated  8,633,082.The income of the Society for 1918 was returned at  926,103; the general fund increased from  1,415,063 (December 1917) to  1,808,384 and the superannuation resef fund from  765,998 to  824,698.   The society obtains an annual interest of  80,000 from its investments, whioh arf largely in national war stookThe roll of membership has increased from 298,782 in 1918, to over 318,000,   Benefits cost  1,4.0^ and managerial 8/lli per member.&quot;INFORMANTS&quot; IN LABOUR movements the. &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has been making play with the disclosures of:. the shop steward Murphy.   This man was neve a Police &quot;informant&quot;, but it is understood that he acted f for a group of capitalists in attempting.to;avert a strike. There is reason to believe that at this time he was a paid agent of a revolutionary organisation, and that he accepted- the/
the r$Le of &quot;informant&quot; with the full knowledge and approval I     of his revolutionary employers, in the hope of gaining information.v - r-rm^JMBMM JTBOOPS.On tho 2 nd August about 800 men of thf Slouoosterehiro, Warwick land Beria^ireregimente refused to ^     to the 2)oo3cs .   at Southampton to proceed to i^anoe, under tte idea that they were to he sent to Russia.   On the following day, with the assl stance of an armed guard of the&apos; Suss ex regiment they were removed without disturbance in army lorries.There seems to have been no incitement on the part of civilians, though it was clear that the crowd was sympathetic. The men were on leave from France, and it seems probable that their demonstration was planned before they oame home on leave.THE? KATIOE&amp;L DMQg OF JMOT UM * -  J    :-I referred in my report last week to the increased activity of this Society and to its connection with the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   The connection is further established hy the Society^ demand, originally put forward by. Mr. Outhwaite in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, that all ex-Service men shall be paid the difference between their pay and that of the Colonial troops - roughly 5s. per diem for the duration of the war. It is proposed that the tods to meet this-expenditure shall be raised by the sooialisation of the land.A conference at Caxfcon Hall on August 83rd was attended by delegates of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and the &quot;Comrades of the Great War&quot; from various parts of the country.  Mr. Outhwaite was amongst those who addressed the meeting, which passed

The Conference was in favour of the Sankey report and called for increased production for the use of the entire population.  Further it declared itself opposed to dictatorship &quot;whether organised by a Church, a King or Eopperor, an Aristocracy, a Plutocracy, or by usurpers such as Lenin and Trotsky,&quot; and urged the &quot;emancipation of India from British domination.&quot;    The speeches were mo&amp;erate in tons.WQMETS INTERBATIOHAL SOCIALIST LEAGUEllll jlimiMllllll     MM II   Mil     I     ...........     i...............H.....................The current number of the &quot;Workers1 IDreaanought&quot; reprints; an &quot;Appeal to the Socialist Women of all Lands&quot; &apos;.dated Berlin, August 13th and issued by Klara Zetkin, on whom has fallen the mantle of Bosa Luxemburg.   The appeal contains the suggestion that a conference of the Women^s International Socialist League, of which she is International Secretary, should bs held In Switzerland next autumn, and kept distinct from all other socialist meetings in order to bridge the differences which-have arisen in international socialism.THE IRISH SEIff-LETBR-I IEaTIOI? LB&amp;GuTS 0? GREAT BRITAINThis League, funded in May 1919, is very active and is t making some headway in  ondon; branches have reoently beenformed to cover the Paddington, Peckham, Kensington and South Western Districts.  The objects of the League are:
1 III1. i&quot; y I -tf1.   &quot;To secure the application of the principle of Self-Determination to,Ireland.&quot;2.   &quot;To secure the release of all Irish Politioal      ^ prisoners.&quot;Membership is confined to people of Irish birth or descent, resident in Great Britain, and no branch is allowed to take any aotion in regard to, or any part in, English politics.The President of the league is A.P. Q1 Brian, Secretary of the Gaelic League;   he is the leader of Sinn Fein in -   London, and is connected with Jack Tanner of the Industrial Workers of the World.   Laurence Ginnell and Herbert Devine have also addressed London meetings.   The Central branch usually meet at Chandos Hall, but on August 16th the Catholio Schools at Pecfcham were used for a meeting, which was addressed by Mrs. Pearse and Miss Connolly.The League is undoubted3y a rallying point for the Sinn Fein element in London, as in Liverpool, and appears to be working in close touch with other extremist factions.MR. W.A. APPLETOMIn the Quarterly Report of the General Federation of IPrade Unions, which has just been issued, the secretary, Mr. W.A. Appleton, the recently elected President of the International Trade Union Congress, voices an opinion which maybe taken to represent the views of responsible labour leaders:&quot;The home affairs of the General Federation require careful handling. Strikes have been precipitated which might have been avoided.   Union funds and Federation    f funds have been needlessly dissipated.   Some of the strikes have had a distinctly political origin. Political strikes must either fail or end in revolution.They/
  11 -3?hey are not against tho capitalist, hut against the community.   It is not tho capitalist who suffers, hut the people.  Against such strikes the Government must protect the people or it must surrender its functions. She.effect  of such strikes is to decrease production and increase the price of all commodities.In view of the national situation and the possibility of a grave shortage, it is imperative that Trade Unionists should face the facts.   The outstanding ones are that the war is over; that competitive laws as between nations are now forcefully operating; that food and raw materials required for the sustenance of the men and women of Britain must be bought from countries over whose merchants our Government has no control; and that these commodities must be paid for with goods and not paper.   November 1919, to May 19B0, will be fateful^months; unless sanity returns and production increases they will be tragio months.&quot;MISS SYLVIA PANKHURST1 ^VIEWS ON LABOUR&quot;These are very dark days&quot; writes Miss Pankhurst in a recent commentary on Labour topics.   The realisation of impotence Is at the root of her depression; events have convinced her that her joint aims, the perpetuation of the Bolshevik regime in Russia and its reproduction in this country, are unattainable, at least at present.In common with other extremists, Miss Pankhurst is violently opposed to the orthodox Labour leaders; her main grievances are, that the Berne Conference remained aloof from the Third (Moscow) Internationaleand/
ana that the Trade Union officials continue to adhere f the principle of collective bargaining. She professesj find a &quot;healthy tendency&quot; towards her o\m oonviotions ij British worker and deplores the faot that it is &quot;baulkei every point &quot;by- old-fashioned officialdom.&quot;Miss Pankhurst regards as a &quot;calamitous mistake iJS policy&quot; the request from the Second Internationale that! British soldiers should &quot;be retained in the Caucasus, on the ground that the Turks would otherwise murder the Armenians.She considers that the Ejcecutlve of the Triple Alliance abandoned the ballot on Direct Action in conse of the small support given to the Police by Trade Unionr and adds that the polios have real ground for complain^ about this. lack of support;In regard to nationalization of the mines, Miss Pankhurst doubts if Mr. Smillie will carry out his three of industrial force;.   &quot;Unfortunately, it has become a habit with many people to talk loudly of future strikes and to oppose every strike when the moment for action arrives.&quot;COUNCILLOR S. SHITOSLLThe prominent Clyde agitator, Shinwe 11, was released from prison on August 23rd.  During his imprisonment he was re-elected Chairman of the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council.,THB &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;Mr. Lansbury, in conversation with a friend, confessed that he was losing  750 a week at the present time, and that they are very anxious tp get money.   It bas been gathered in conversation that Mrs. Fels is thechief/
ischief financial supporter of the paper, and that Mrs, W,M. Hughes acts as a sort of collector..Mr, Geoffrey, Pyke, author ef &quot;iviy Escape from Ruhlehen&quot; and now manager of the JCambridge i^gazine,&quot; appears to he closely associated with Mr. Norman Angel In the &quot;Herald.&quot;A possible solution, of the difficulty about the &quot;Herald&quot; might be for responsible Trades Unionists to buy but Mr. Lansbury and run It as a moderate labour paper.  It has already acquired some circulation, and there would therefore be a smaller fin&amp;noial burden than if a new Labour daily-paper were started to compete with it,LEGISLATION AGAINST REypLUTIONAift ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES In February, March and April of this year Various States in North America passed drastic Acts against revolutionary activities.The Act passed in Washington on January 14th 1919, prescribes criminal syndicalism as the doctrine&apos; which advocates crime, sabotage, violence or other unlawful methods of terrorism, and lays down that such methods, or their advocacy, whether by spoken propaganda, 1he publication or distribution of literature, or the organization or membership of societies favouring suon methods, beoome separately acts of felony.Similar legislation was passed in California and Utah, where sabotage is defined as meaning wilful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property, and in New Hampshire; the penalties ere imprisonment for terms varying from one to fourteen years o* fines of from 100 - 1000 dollars. : , ,In Massachusetts an Act was approved on May 88th 1919, which, among other an ti-revolutionary measures provides thatany/
any parson guilty of spoken or written propaganda may be arrested by a sheriff or police officer without a warrant.In Hew Jersey and West Virginia there are enactments against the; use of red or M.ack flags or other revolutionary.. emblems; the penalty in New Jersey Is a fine not exceeding 2000 dollars or a term of hard labour not exceeding 15 years, or both;   in West Virginia the penalty varies from a conviction for misdemeanour for the first offence to confinement in a penitentiary for 1 - 6 years for the:. /third offence. %     - * r^ii-^^^yY&apos;.THE rJTEaBfAJIQBAI SOCIALIST COHERENCE AT LUCERgEThe &quot;Permanent Commission of the Labour and Socialist International &quot;met at Lucerne from August 2nd to August 9th; Mr. Arthur Headers on presided and 54 delegates represented 21 States.   This Commission is a provisional body arising ou^ of the Berae Conference; it is distinct from the Executive of the International Socialist Bureau and is in dGaot a &quot;Commission of the International Conference for the Reconstruction of the Internationale&quot;,, by which title it is known abroad.As has baen the case at all the post-bellum International conferences the question of responsibility for the war was raised at the outset and Vandervelde (Belgium) declared that the reconstitution of the Internationale was impossible until this question had been settled.It was, however, agreed that the regular international i onal Congress should be held at Geneva oh February 2nd, 1920. 408 votes were allotted to the nations affiliated, Great , Britain,the United States, France, Germany and Russiabeing/

The last named had already been recommended for deportation for a previous conviotion.    A quantity of revolutionary literature, emanating from the Industrial Workers of the World, was seized during this raid,IRELAND/
