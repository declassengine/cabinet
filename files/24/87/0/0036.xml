o&amp;/^...c.c A-  ^This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government89WAR CABINET.EMORANDUM ON LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR HUBERT GOUGH&apos;S MISSION IN THE BALTIC STATES.1. On the 13th May, the situation in the Baltic States was considered by the Baltic Commission in Paris, who were of opinion: (a.) That the maintenance of order was a necessary condition for the distribution&apos; of foodstuffs in the Baltic States. (b.) That the present maintenance of order in Lithuania and Latvia was entirely in the hands of the Germany, (c.) That the despatch of Allied troops to the Baltic States was out of the question.In view of these considerations, the Baltic Commission recommended to the Council of Foreign Ministers that a competent military mission under British command should proceed to the Baltic States, for the purpose of advising the local governments on questions relating to the training and equipping of local forces with which to replace the German army of occupation, and for the purpose of arranging for the withdrawal of the German forces.On the 23rd May, these recommendations by the Baltic Commission were adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers, and instructions were issued to the War Office by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in Paris, to proceed at once with the organi-zation of the Mission as recommended, with General Gough as Chief. General Gough in the meanwhile had arrived at Helsingfors as Chief of the British Military Mission to Finland, which had been previously organized.In accordance with the orders which had been received from Paris, the attached instructions (Appendix) were drawn up, officially appointing General Gough Chief of the British Military Mission to Finland and the Baltic States. These instructions were approved by Mr. Balfour in Paris, and were circulated to the various Allied delegations.It will be seen from paragraph 3 of these instructions that the Governments of the other principal Allied and Associated Powers had agreed that the execution of Allied military policy in the Baltic States should be under British control, and that Allied officers were to be attached to General Goughs Mission.2. Subsequent to the capture of Riga, on the 24th May, a very serious situation arose from the manifest intention of the Germans to continue their advance in a northerly direction into Esthonia, with a view to establishing their predominence in that country. Further the British fleet at Libau was in imminent danger of being driven from its anchorage by the German shore guns.In view of the gravity of the situation, and the necessity for immediate action being taken to prevent the German advance, General Gough, on the 10th June, on his own responsibility, issued certain orders to General von der Goltz. This was entirely in accordance with the instructions to counteract German domination [vide Appendix paragraph 5 (a) ), a summary of which was cabled to General Gough on the 7th June. General Goughs ultimatum was issued at a most opportune moment, and was the cause of making General von der Goltz pause, creating a breathing space during which Paris was able to take action.General Gough reported the action which he had taken to Paris, and requested that his orders might be confirmed through the usual channel. General Gough&apos;s orders were rejected by General von der Goltz ; but, it having been foreseen that this would be the case, the Supreme Council on the 12th June instructed Marshal Foch to forward a &apos; fresh demand through the Armistice Commission relative to the withdrawal of the German forces in the Baltic. States.On the 9th July, on the instructions of the Supreme Council, Marshal Foch notified the German authorities through the medium of the Armistice Commission at Spa that, in order to expedite and facilitate the execution of the dispositions contemplated(B19/383)  250  8/19  H&amp;S  V427wo
in the demand referred to above, the Allied and Associated Governments authorized General Gough to enter into direct communication with the local German Command with a view to the settlement of all questions which might arise with reference to the application of the dispositions referred to.3. On the 16th July, General Gough wrote a letter to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in which he asked when the High Commissioner who had been appointed might be expected, as he was anxious to return home himself and see after his private affairs. General Gough pointed out that the appointment of such an official was absolutely necessary; that pending his arrival he had been carrying out, under difficulties, the functions of such an official, but that he had not been recognized as such, neither had the political side been definitely placed under his direction. He pointed out at the same time that, owing to the goodwill of Colonel Tallents, work was proceeding fairly satisfactorily, but that the organization did not appear to be suitable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, under his No. 02/508, of the 5th August, forwarded a copy of this letter to Lord Curzon, and, while pointing out that General Gough&apos;s military status facilitated in no small degree the execution of his delicate task vis-a-vis the local German military authorities, and gave him an advantage&apos; which a civil commissioner would not possess, suggested that General Gough&apos;s position might- be reconsidered with a view to his being made dejure what .he actually was de facto, viz., High Commissioner for the Allied and Associated Powers in the Baltic States. Field Marshal Sir Henry &quot;Wilson at the same time drew Lord Curzons attention to the fact that some six weeks had elapsed since the question had first arisen of appointing a High Commissioner to the Baltic States.It should be noted that this letter, together with other telegrams relative to this matter, was addressed by General Gough to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff personally, and merely contained suggestions which were put forward with a view to improving the existing unsatisfactory organization.4. With reference to the formation of the Russian North-West Government, General Gough/reported, on the 15th August, that this had been effected at his instigation, in view of the following reasons :--(a.) The critical condition of the Russian North-Western Army.(b.) The seriousness of a threat by the Esthonian Army to refuse do participate in further operations against the Bolsheviks unless Esthonian independence was granted;(c.) The need of the fusion of democratic and reactionary parties into a whole-hearted attack on the Bolsheviks.It should be noted, however, that although the formation of the Russian North-West Government was carried out at General GougtYs instigation, executive Allied action in this connection was carried out through the medium of the British Military and Diplomatic Representatives and Representatives of France and the United States (vide telegram No. IXC. 11, dated 14th August, from Deputy Commissioner, Reval). The Deputy Commissioner, Reval, moreover, in his telegram, No. D.C. 14, of the 14th August, reported that General Gough had invited him to take over all political negotiations in connection with the establishing of the Russian North-West Government at Reval; and in his No. D.C. 19, of the 15th August, the Deputy Commissioner&apos; reported that General Gough had requested him to present to the Esthonian Ministry for Foreign Affairs a note to the latter which he (General Gough) had drawn up. The Deputy. Commissioner, Reval, in this telegram No. D.C. 20, of the 15th August, moreover, emphasized the fact that the Russian North-West Government had been formed as a result of Allied pressure.It will be seen, therefore, that all action of an executive and political nature in connection with the Russian North-West Government wras carried out with the approval of, and through the medium of. the British and Allied Political Representatives.5. The following are, briefly, the main results of the action taken by General Gough during the period in which he has been chief of the British Military Mission to the Baltic States : (1.) The German forces have been compelled to withdraw from the whole of the territory claimed by the Latvian Government north of the River Duna, and &apos; also from the whole of North Courland.(2.) The Germans have been prevented from continuing their advance into Esthonia, and thus establishing their predominance in that country.
(7427)(3.) The restraint which General Gough has exercised upon the Esthonian army has reacted in a most favourable manner upon the moral of the whole country, with the result that the insidious propaganda of the Germans has had little effect.(4.) Although the expulsion of the Germans from Northern Latvia and Riga was largely effected through the instrumentality of the Esthonian army, it was. only through the pressure exercised by General Gough on the Esthonian High Command that the Esthonian Army, at the height of its victorious advance against the Germans, was prevented from entering the town of Riga and being involved in operations of a more lengthy nature with the German forces.   &apos; &apos;(5.) Under General Gough&apos;s direction, the Latvian army has been reconstructed, with the result that it is now in a position to offer effective opposition to the Bolshevik advance. General Gough, moreover, has been successful in removing friction between the Letts and the Baits to the extent that the Bait Landwehr, now purged of Germans, forms an integral part of the Latvian army.(6.) In June, General Gough brought pressure to bear on the Commander of the North-Western army to abandon politics in his force, to adopt a lenient attitude towards the inhabitants of the territories occupied by this force, and to modify the aggressive attitude hitherto adopted by this force towards the Esthonians. This action on the part of General Gough resulted in a considerable improvement in the relations between the Esthonians and the North:Western army, and acted as a severe check to Bolshevik propaganda.(7.) In Latvia, M. Ulmanis&apos; Cabinet, after its deposition by the Germans, was re-established at Riga entirely through the instrumentality of General Gough&apos;s Mission, and its position was secured against German interference by this Mission. General Gough, in conjunction with the Allied Political Representatives, prevailed upon M. Ulmanis to form his new Cabinet on a democratic political basis by inclusion of members of the German-Bait Party.(8.) As will be seen from General Gougtfs telegram, No. G.G. 107, of the 17th August, to His Majesty&apos;s Deputy Commissioner at Reval, the latter, on the advice of General Gough, succeeded in eliminating from the Russian North -West Government persons whose tendencies are strongly pro-German and reactionary.It will be seen from the above that the efforts made by General Gough, in the face of great difficulties and opposition, to ensure the execution of the demands made to the Germans by Marshal Foch have met with a considerable measure of success. General Gough&apos;s actions have resulted in removing German influence to a large extent in these States, and it would appear that General Gough, in so far as he has been able hitherto, has carried out the task with which he has been entrusted in a most satisfactory and praiseworthy manner in the interests both of the Baltic States and of the Allies.6. A memorandum has been prepared by the General Staff, and will be ready for circulation at an early date, giving a narrative of events in the Baltic States from the time of the Armistice in November, 1918, up to the present date, with special reference to the action taken by General Gough with a view to combatting German influence and assisting the National Governments in their defensive organization.General Staff,War Office.20th August, 1919.
