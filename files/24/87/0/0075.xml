Farm Settlement and the Board are in communication with other ex-officers whom it is hoped to accept at this Settlement at an early date.    Difficulties are, however, being experienced owing to the lack of accommodation, many of the cottages be j rig old and dilapidated.     The Office of Works haw not yet commenced erecting the Army Huts urgently required at this Settlement.    The total number of ex-Service men now at the Farm Settlements is 226, namely 59 settlers, 135 probationers and 32 men working as wage-earners.     In addition 26 men have been accepted as settlers or probationers, but have not yet started wsrk.The reports received from the Directors show that heavy rain has fallen at all the Settlements, hindering harvest operations but; cons;&quot;derably benefiting the, grass and root crops.

In response to tho Board&apos;s request the y7ar Office have addressed a letter to all Military Commands at home calling attention to the damage which is likely to arise from the seeding of the thistles, and requesting that steps should be taken forthwith to obviate such damage.Credit Scheme.     .    As has been reported already, the Credit Scheme was wound&quot;up on the 31st March, 1919, the Treasury definitely declining to extend it after that date.     Returns have now been received showing that the total number of loans approved by A.lil.Cs. since the inception of the Soheme in March, 1917, was 896, representing tho sum of  75,480.    Of this sum  41,749 had actually been repaid on or before 31st March, 1919, and of the balance outstanding  2,641 represented loans that the applicants had not taken up, while the amount of leans in arrear was  5,718.     A considerable part of the last mentioned sum consists of loans for whioh the period of repayment would be extended in the ordinary oourse, and the actual number of oases in whioh the Board had been called upen to make   good their guarantee is only 10 representing the surd of  631;   even this small amount is mt -bt be regarded as v/holly irrecoverable.(ii)    (b)   Globe Lands Aot, 1888.The number of applications for the Board&apos;s approval to sales under this Act continues abnormally high,   Already this year 290 applications have been received as compared with 252 in the whole of 1918 and 329 in the four years 1914 to 1917,     The following statement shows full particulars to date:-applications  ions Salesreceived,        Acreage   an proved. acroaffP*4 years 1910-1913	325	10 j. 280	317	7,5874 years 1914-1917	329	15,078	313	10,059Year 1918	252	22,960	201	14,00334 weeks to 23/8/19	290	23,804	205	13,828(iii)    Land Drainage.The Great, Quse.   The draft Order for the establishment of a 8ingle&quot;&quot;Drainige&quot;&quot;Board for the Great Ouse and its tributaries will be deposited this week for public inspection.    The six-inch map of the proposed district will be deposited in sections in each of the Counties into which the district extends:   Norfolk, Vest Suffolk , Isle of ^ly, Cambridge, JSssex, Huntingdon, Bedford, Hertford, Buckingham and Northampton.The area of this district is over,480,000 acres;   it includes over  -370,000 acres under existing Drainage Boards, and approximately 109,000 acies which &quot;are now under no authority at all.   The powers of the authorities which at present control internal drainage are left to them;   but it is proposed to transfer to the new body tho powers and duties of the Bedford Level Corporation and other authorities with regard to the main rivers and channels and their bankst
The main river is 140 miles in longth, and at present there is no authority which has any control of it above the west-ward limit of the Fens at iilarith, about 50 miles from the sea.&quot;The draft Order provides for a Drainage Board of 36 members, 9 nominated by County Councils and by the harbour authority at King&apos;s Lynn, and 27 elected by owners and occupiers of land.   For tho first Board (as no election can be hold before it is formed) 27 members have to bo nominated by the Board cf Agriculture in lieu cf election.     A list cf -representative men has been secured, every invitation, to serve having been accepted.The draft OrdiI provides for difforential rating of the various sections cf the district, in respect of the works by which each will bo benefited.     Objections ron this and ether points will doubtless be received from persons and bodies affected; these will be dealt with at a public local enquiry to bo held at Cambridge on the 20th October and following days.River -/witham .   Petitions have been received from the Lindsey and Kesteven County Councils and the Lincoln Corporation for the preparatio n. of an Order establishing a single drainage Board for tho river V/witham .    Proceedings of this kind are now in various stages of progress for all the rivers (except the Nene and the Trent) discharging into tho North Sea from Yorkshire to Essex; in addition to several tributaries of the Thames, the Beult in Kent, the Christ church Avon and Stour, the Clwyd, the Tern and Roden in Shropshire, as well as minor drainage areas.*Glamorganshire   A recent visit to this County by one of the Board&apos;s Drainage Inspectors shows that much drainage work is needed to improve agricultural areas of considerable    value, and that nothing has been done.     The Drainage Committee have been urged to initiate small schemes under Section 16 of the Land Drainage Act, 1918 , and tho establishment o  Drainage Boards for the Ely, Thaw, and Ewenny Rivers has   been suggested to the County Council.Somerset.     Reports have been received from Mr, Sidney Preston, C.I.E. on the engineering aspect, and from the Technical Division on the agricultural aspect, of the drainage problem in the extensive levels behind Bridgwater and Burnham, and the County   Drainage Committee have been asked to consider What action should be taken as regards the Somersetshire Drainage Commission, who arc the responsible authority.     The latter are said to be sceptical as to the utility of spending money on this drainage system, which has been seriously noglcofrod; but the Technical Division report shews that with improved drainage the agricultural possibilities of this tract are very great.     A report on the inspection by the Technical Division will bo found in the part, of this Report relating to that Division.(iv) ZJ-il1^.?. Commons, Copyhold and Survey .Tithe rentcharge is recoverable from any part of the property upon which it is charged.and in cases in which land has become minutely subdivided into many ownerships it is usual for the titheowner, in collecting his tithe rent charge, to call upon one owner for payment of the who]e amount, the best practicable remedy open to such owner being to apply to the Board&apos;for the compulsory redemption of the entire tithe rent charge,,     Among the applications for corpulsory redemption received are two for Loughbo rough.
(Leicester) and V/ithington (Lancaster) by the Groat Central Railway Company who have been called upon to pay the whole of the tithe rent charges upon lands of which their line of Railway forms part only,     In the Loughborcugh case the Company have had to collect contributions amounting in all to  3. 19, 2d. annually from 46 different property owners, while in \7ithington tho shares       V attributable to 11 other twners amounted to 5/- in all. ^In compulsory redemptions affecting very numerous small properties in Tutbury (Stafford) , Woston-super-Maro (Somerset) Gateshead (Durham) and Aldershot (Southampton) , the hearings ef objections were fixed for the 25th inst. and such objections have now been duly determined.^xlocments of land for Recreation Grounds made from time to time under the Inclosure Act, 1845, were, pursuant to Section 73 of that Act, awarded to the churchwardens and overseers for the time being of the parish, to bo held by them in trust as places of recreation for the inhabitants of the parish and neighbourhood.     Seotion 28 of the Coranons Act, 1876, requiros such trustees, at intervals of not less than throe years nor more than five years, to make reports to the Board as to tho management of the recreation grounds.     The Board have addressed te the trustees of about 370 Recreation Grounds enquiries as to tho suitability, oondition, finances, maintenance, and present use of the grounds, and have in/ited aty observations by the trustees of a general nature as te any means by which the grounds may be made more readily available, by       . -exchange or sale for other lands, for the purposes set out under the Inclosure Acts.     In view of the iiirportance, from the point of view of food production, of maintaiigand, so far as is possible, adding to the attractions of rural life, tho proper management of recreation grounds is a matter of considerable interest to the Board.Commercial division.Building Branch.Appointment ef Architects.

In February 1918, the Board sent a Circular Letter to A.E.CB. asking what additional transport facilities would be likely to be required after the war.    Replies suggesting routes have been received from 23 Committees, recommending the establishment of 78 rail services and 58 motor services, together with 22 services in which the Committees thought that either means of transport might be used satisfactorily.    Subsequently 15 of these routes. &quot;&quot;rere withdrawn.     In addition to the districts covered by these suggestions 81 other districts were selected for investigation;   in 14 of these schemes were previously approved for the establishment of light railways and in 48 schemes were recommended by the Road Transport Board.     Of the routes suggested by local authoritieb about three-fourths of the routes have how been reported on and the investigation of the remainder is, expected to be -completed shortly.     ^he enquiries have mainly been directed towards estimating the tonnage of agricultural produce available for transport by any given route, the extent to which the additional facilities would be taken advantage of, and the possible effect on the area under cultivation.    Reports on the proptsed services will be made to the Ministry of Transport.

Ho work was.available for 93 tractors and 135 traotors were under repair.The returns received showed that 1701 acres were ploughed, 1612 acres cultivated and 921 acres reaped by the 341 tractors at work under both schemes, giving an average of 5.0, 4.7, and 2.7 acres respectively.     Harvesting operations were carried out in 17 counties.The highest average ,acreage was.recorded in Cambridge where 9 tractors ploughed 81 acres and cultivated 69,   average 9.0 and 7.5 acres respectively.
Steam Tackle Beetion.    During tlie week ending 23rd August 1919, returns of work done were received in respect of   41 sets of Government Supplied Steam Tackle and show tho following results:-Ploughed 712 Implement Acros&quot;Tl7.36 acres per set);   Cultivated 62S&amp; Implement Acres (153.43 acres per sot);   Harrowed 205 Implement Acres (5 acres per set);   Hole Drained 35 acres and Rolled 26 acres.

Arrangernents have been made with tho Coal Mines &quot;Department for supplies of steam coal to bo accumulated at various centres throughout England and Wales.    These stocks will bg reserved for agricultural purposes. &apos;A.E.Cs. have been informed of the schemeand asked to supply tho information required in order that the centres and quantities of coal may be determined.     Coal for agricultural purposes will continue to be rationed, under the scheme which was formulated in December last and farmers are being warned by a Press notice to place orders as early as possible with their usual merchants for steam coal required before the end of the year.    Pending the provision of steam coal, agricultural requirements will be met from any stocks of coal that may be available.Horse Section.    Tho number of horses reported to have been sold since the last return is 43, the price realised being ,321,010 or an average ef 347 each.    The class of horse being offered for Salo now is probably not so good as that which was sold two or three months ag6,    lioreover, the high price of hay is no doubt tending to make horses much cheaper.The total number of horses sold to date is 7957 and the nott amount realised is -3486,816. 14. 2, an average .o,f  60 each.The number of Food Production horses still to be sold is about 1,000.Mu cat ion Branch.Proposals for &quot;reconstructed&quot; grants to the Agricultural Colleges and University &quot;Departments have now been settled and will shortly be submitted to the Treasury.    The new grants will total approximately  45,000 as against the pre-war figure of  17,000, and will, it is hopod, enable these Institutions to pay adequate salaries to.their staffs.    The pre-war scale of pay was miserably low even on the then valuo of money.Proposals for the reconstruction of&apos;the Research Institutes on similar lines are under consideration by tho Finanoe Division of tho Board.     These proposals include suggestions for improving the Board?s local organisation in relation to advisory work in ilant Diseases.    A number of fresh nominations ta Research Exhibitions h;.ve been received and will be referred to the Advisory Committee in Agricultural Science.County Education.    The Somerset Education Authority, in furtherance of the Scheme of Agricultural &quot;Sducaticn recently submitted for the Board&apos;s approval, have provisionally decided to establish a Farm Institute at Cannington Court, near Bridgwater. Their proposals will be discussed in detail at a conference which is being arranged between the County Organiser and officers of the Division.
Inspections by Technical Division.Drainage Scheme in Somerset.    An inspection v/as recently made of land - in Somerset for the purpose of estimating, from the point of view of agriculture, the value of a scheme of drainage in the valleys of the Parrot, Tone, Gary, Brue and Axe.     Tho Scheme, which is estimated to cost at.out 2330,000 would&apos; render the low lying land in the neighbourhood of these rivers immune from floods, which occur from time to time and threaten some 70,000 acres.     The district offers great possibilities for dairying but the constant danger of flood renders the grazing of the lowland pastures precarious, even in summer time, while from 1st November to the middle of Hay there are practically no cattle at all on the marshes.     Much of the land, is permanently water-logged and the quality of the herbage suffers accordingly.     If by improving the drainage the grazing period on the marshes could be extended for a month or so at either end of the summer the gain to agriculture would be great.     If the marshes could be dried altogether the gain, in a county where cattle can normally be wintered out of doors, would be all tho greater.    With the lower land available for pasture, and improved by artificial manures, more land in the neighbourhood might be restored to cultivation and openings provided for closer settlement cn small dairy holdings, where a strong local dairying tradition already exists.Reclaimed land in Cambridgeshire.     An inspection was also recently made of certain farms that had boon taken over by the Cambridgeshire A.E.C.     These farms had almost all been in a very bad condition when taken over, being largely overgrown with bush and owing much of what comparatively little value they possessed to the Shooting they afforded.     One, for instance, taken over as late as last kichaolmas, was of about 36?. acres, of whioh arable and derelict land, almost equally divided, made up over 300 acres. -Of the old arable land.137 acres are now under crop, while some 93 acres of the derelict land, have been got ready for autumn sowing.    Part cf another^  farm has been worked in with this, and affords an even better object lesson of tho Committee&apos;s excellent work. Last September, of 143 acres, 118 were rough grass covered with bushes;   now the whole has been steam cultivated, and most of it drained, in preparation for autumn    corn.   Another farm of nearly 400 acres, without any buildings, and entirely devoted to bush and game h s since February 1918 been stubbed, ditched and mole-drained and. has now about 190 acres under crop.&apos; The above instances are typical of all the farms inspected on which the work that has been accomplished reflects great credit on the skill and. perseverance of the Committee.

Training cf Men.Disabled Men.     Training All chances.     The decision of the Ministries of Labour and Pensions that whilst a disabled man is in training he shall receive allowances at the rate of the maximum disability pensions scale instead of having the choice of either of the two scales of training allowances at present in force will take effect as from the first pay day after the 6th September.     Under the new scale disabled ex-privates in training will receive a personal allowance of 40/- per week apart from any additional dependents&apos; allowances for which he may be eligible.    Agricultural Executive Committees will be instructed immediately as to the procedure to be followed in bringing intc operation the payment of the new scale of allowances.
Fit Men,     Training Allowances.     The Ministry of Labour have decided that the new scale of allowances for disabled men in training shall also apply to fit ex-Service men in training : under that Department.     It would not appsar to be desirable to apply this rate to able-bodied men being trained in agriculture, but the proposal is under consideration.Fresh Centres.

The Secretary of the Education Committee has been visited and suggestions have been made to him as to the lines along which horticultural development should take place.Cultivation Section.The survey of farm orchards in the west of England has been commenced in Somerset by the Board&apos;s Inspectors working in conjunction with the Agricultural Instruction Committee.     Ilminster, Wedmore and Wiveilscombe have been decided upon as typical districts for this purpose.
The neglected orchard at Island Farm, Bridgend, which was chosen for the Glamorgan Agricultural   xecutive Committee for demonstration purposes, has been visited   :-; and found to have been greatiy improved by pruning * spraying, etc.Training Centres.     Inspection has been made of Xr, 3, W, Lobjoifs Fruit and : market Gardens at,Isleworth with a view io the establishment Of a centre for training disabled men in horticulture.

There is, however, no land attached to the school, and instructional work   , would therefore have to be carried out on land belonging to ,neighbouring market gardeners.     Market gardening in the district is in a very neglected state, and consequently suitable facilitiesfor training purposes are not available here.Holleyn Hall, wylam, Northumberland, has been favourable reported on aa to its suitability for a training centre.The suitability of Newhouse Farm,   -Newnham, Gloucestershire, as a training centre for ex-Service men, has been pointed out to the County Land Agents, and its   purchase by the Small Holdings Committee seems likely.ITruit Preservation.     The Freos Notice giving particulars to the general public of the series of short courses, at the Board&apos;s Canning Kitchen, in Fruit and Vegetable Preservation has created very great interest as evinced by the number of enquiries which have been received.     The vacancies for the course which commenced on the 25th inst. were filled last week.Bee-keeping.     The Board have completed their arrangements for the issue of sugar for the Autumn feeding of bees, and the necessary forms have been dispatched to the County Authorities who are dealing with the Scheme.Plant Disease Section.wart Disease.     65 new cases are reported from Denbighshire, from fields as well as gardens.     This supports the Board&apos;s decision to schedule the whole of the county.Other new cases are reported from Cardiganshire, Cheshire and Cumberland.
In the part of Monmouthshire not scheduled some 75$ of potatoes grown are of immune varieties.Immune Varieties.     Great Scot is still the most popular, i&amp;cellent crops of Majestic and Tinwald Perfection are reported from Lancashire,     It was noted in one field that the correct sized seed of Majestic gave a splendid crop;   whereas large tubers planted as seed gave a patchy, unsatisfactory crop.Aphis.     iaich damage to potato foliage, due to Aphides, is reported &quot;from the i^aet Hiding of Yorkshire and from Leicestershire.Silver Leaf.      inquiries made in fruit growing districts suggest that the majority of growers would heartily support an trder made by the Board.Small Live Stock.The Board are continually receiving complaints that Local Authorities are renewing the restrictions on the keeping tf small live stock, which were suspended during the war. The Board have asked the Ministry of Health whether they would agree to the joint isbue of another Circular to Local Authorities pointing cut the necessity of still further increasing the food supply and asking them to suspend restrictive -i,bye-laws against the keeping of pigs;   but that Ministry have expressed the view that the Board should take such action direct.     The Board are intervening in certain special cases between the Local Authorities and pig-keepers.Labour Division.Demobilization.     The number of men described as agriculturists demobilized during the seven days ended 20th August was 856, making the total demobilized to that date 244,282.It is understood that the -Var Office are now disposed to adojpt a more liberal attitude in regard to applications for release made by proprietors of &quot;Ono man&quot; businesses;   but in all cases it is very essential that the facts put forward by Agricultural iaceoutive Committees in support of applications should have been thoroughly investigated before Buch applications are recommended.Agricultural Occupations.     The number of agricultural labourers, skilled tr unskilled, registered at Employment ilxchanges in England and Vales, as available for employment on the land on,the 22nd August was 1,430.7/omen&apos;s Branch.About 25G women of the Land Army are now at work in six counties for the Flax Harvest.A certain amount of difficulty is now being experienced in the ordinary employment of the Land Army on account of the recent decision of the Agricultural &apos;wages. Board to fix a higher rate for women workers, and on account also of the low billeting rate for women living in farm houses.     The Agricultural -/ages Board has fixed that rate at 13/- per week.
The Women&apos;e Coiothittees have to conform to this order with the result that many women of the Land Army, contrary to their own and. to their emjbloyer&apos;s wish, can no longer remain in employment,    With the present price of food the billeting rate of !&amp;/** a wteek would seem to be very low.In Surrey the Agricultural Education Cbtanittee has recently organised a very successful olassirt thatching for wbmkn.     Bbth Land Army and local women have been included.ihe Chairman of the Cornwall County Council, In Opening a Horticultural Show for the St, Just Women&apos;a institute, referred to a visit he had just paid to a Cornish holding worked by two members of the Land Army who are making their farm pay.Women&apos;d Institutes.

Fisheries Division.Fisheries in tho Scuth \/ost of inland.   Tho Secretary of tho Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers1 Union, accompanied by so -/oral representative ambers of the St. Ives Branch of the Union, attended a Conference at 43, Parliament Street with officers of the Fisheries Division and of the Ministry of Food with regard to questions of distribution, marketing, pri 5)s of fish in the coming winter, ooc, with particular reference to their bearing upon fishing interests in the South Jest of iungland.   Mr. Bevin stated that thu fishermen wished, to have a separate Ministry of Fisheries. Mr. Maurice said there were strong objections to the creation cf more now Ministries.   Mr. Bevin then urged that there should bo a strong Advisory Coramittoe on which fishermen were -represented.     Mr. Maurice said provision would be made for that under the \griculture and Fisheries (Council &amp;c) Bill, but he anticipated that it would bo difficult to secure tho attendance tf real fishermen.     He had been considering, therefore, whether it might not bo more useful and practical to have regular district conferences sitting under the presidertiy of the district inspectors and combining all interests.     He suggested that, to tost the practical utility of this course, a Local Conference should bo hold at Plymouth, at which representatives of all interests should be present, when the questions raised at tho Deputation could bo ,morc fully discussed and some practical remedial measures perhaps devised.      Mr. Bevin, the Secretary of the Union, gladly agreed, and a Conference is being arranged for an early date.     Mr. Lcvoaux, of the Ministry of Food, invited Mr. Bevin to call and discuss with him tho question of the control of prices of fish for the winter months.Coal and Ice Supplies.   Steam trawlers have been held up at Lowestoft and Yarmouth for want of ice, the Ice Companies being, unable to manufacture adequate supplies owing to the shortage of coal.     The Board have approached the Coal Controller and have arranged with him for tho supply of additional coal for the Ice ,, Factories.     jilvcn S3, however, the local ice factories camot meet the necessities of the Autumn herring fishery, which are generally met in part by tho importation of largo supplies of ice from Norway:, which for this season aro not and cannot be made available.     The Board have, however, ascertained that there are surplus supplier cf   homo manufactured ice available at Aberdeen, and have arranged vith the Admiralty for tho charter to a local firm of two Ad niralty trawlers of the largest type to carry ice from Aberdeen to Lewestoft and Yarmouth during the continuation of the shortage. A now ice factory is being: erected at Yarmouth, but will not bo in working order for some months.Fish Hawkers.    The Division have been in constant coiaaunication with the Ministry cf Labour and, the. Civil Liabilities Department with regard to the equipment of ex-serviao men for fish hawking, and there is the possibility of a definite scheme on theso lines being instituted at Lowest-ft.   If it is successful. further developments may be hoped for.   One of the Board:s District Inspectors has tested for one day the possibilities of hawking by a motor-car, and with two friends was successful in making a profit on the day&apos;s work of 10/- each, after making full allowances for all expenses.Italian Fisheries. .   In view of the serious food shortage in Italy, energetic attempts are-&apos;:being made, to increase the fish
supplies-in that country, and the Seorotary of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in London has been supplied with information regarding the organisation of British Fisheries, methods of capture, etc. for the purposes of a report to tho Italian Authorit ios.Surrender of German Fishing Boats under tho issues Treaty,Capt. Stewart, R.H.R., attended a Meeting at Paris to represent the Board with refcronce to proposals mado by tho German Authorities for carrying out tho terms of the peace Treaty relating to the surrender of German fishing vessels to this country. On his return tho subject was further discussed in Conference with the Ministry of Shipping and the Admiralty. , The German proposals wore, in effect, that, instead of handing cvor 25$ of their existing fishing craft (most of which is new construction) they shtuld hand over rnly 25$ of the,25$ now, and should build vessels to hand over in respect of the remaining 75$ within twelve months.    The view of the Beard, which was accepted by the Conference, was that wo should insist upon the Btrict fulfilment of the terms of the Peace- Treaty and consent to no postponement. It has also been arranged that the Beard shall bo represented on the Shipping Sub-Committee of tho Reparation Commission.Distribution.    Transport difficulties aro still causing grave concern, and the staff of the Division is constantly . engaged in endeavouring to deal with minor difficulties which in the aggregate cause a great deal of. delay and dislocation. In this connection the staff has boon by no moans unsuccessful.&apos;General Division.Flax Production Branch.The following particulars show tho progress made with the flax harvest at all five centres:-Acres pulled 9460stacked 386011      remaining to be puliod   2595&quot; &quot; &quot;     &quot; stacked 6729At Yeevil Contro the quality of tho flax straw and seed was 90^ and the two new districts tapped this year viz:- Culm Valley,Tivorton, and Minehoad, whore a small acreage has boon grown, have produced the very finest quality of straw of the whole area and tho cr*rp has boon exceedingly well harvestod. Given fair weather the harvest should be completed by the 7th prox. At Sclby Centre the yield of harvested crops is very much bettor than was expected six weeks age.     Generally, the quality is fairly good though there is considerable variation.     On the wholo it is not expected that the average yield will be much below that of last year - probably net less than 2-  tons to the aero.   -At Peterborough and Siijrf^ll^ccntres the crops are fairly good. At Fife centre the crop is estimated to be heavier than last year&apos;s crop a more uniform thickness and has matured ovenly&apos; giving a bettor quality of :fibre and seed.

By reason of early sowing, however, (and in conjunction with the good weather of late) a good proportion of the crops has been secured.     So far 71 acres of wheat, 50 acres of winter oats, and 13 acres of blue peas have been stooked, besides which a considerable acreage of wheat, barley, spring oats, winter beans, grey peas and linseed has been cut;   and it is estimated that the results will compare m6st favourably with those of last year!s crops.A considerable amount of labour has been expended pn the clearing of dykes in view of the loss suffered last winter through some of the land being waterlogged with the water coming from the hills.     The land in this district is very flat, and the main dykes have not been cleaned out for years.     This work has been tackled at odd times during the summer, and already nearly two miles of main dykes have been thoroughly cleaned.Economics Division.Statistical Branch.The work has been of a routine character - tabulating the agricultural returns, etc.     The number of claims received under the Corn Production Act now amount to 23,800.The provisional estimate the provisional estimate of the Returns Livestock based upon B0&apos;,o of the returns received, week, indicates a slight increase in the aroa ofof Acreage and sent forward last arable land in1919, as compared with last year;    but there has nevertheless been a substantial decrease in the amount of land devoted to corn crops. The reduction in the case of wheat sppears to be something like 300,000 acres, the total acreage having gone back to two and a quarter millions.     Tho estimate for livestock indicates that the total number of cattle has been maintained, but that on the whole there has-been a slight decrease in the dairy herd.     The number of sheep has fallen very materially from the very low figure of last year, and the flocks of the country are now smaller than in any previously recordod year.     There is a sign of some roccvery in, the number of pigs as compared with June 1918.Markets Branch.Official certificates were issued for the export of 40 horses, 337 sheep (by the Agricultural Relief of the Allies Committee) and 72 goats to Prance;   and for 1 horse, 21 cattle and 48 sheep to Argentina.     Twenty-five certificates for forage to Jersey were also issued.- &apos;A meeting of the Supervisory Committee for the Export of Livestock to Allied Countries was held on the 22nd instant.Farm &apos;.;erkers; Branch.Trouble has arisen in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire over the employment of Irish labour, and a number of farm workers in the
HoIteach district of Lincolnshire arc stated to have come cut on strike as a protest.     The matter is being investigated.-A few complaints have been reoeived as to tho &apos; employment of German prisoners instead of English labour.The report of the state of employment in agriculture in July is being prepared.     It is estimated that the number of men employed rose from 501,000 to 570,000 &apos; between July 1918 and July 1939, an increase of 69,000;   and&apos; that the number of &quot;n c. i.,women employed fell from 91,000 to 75,000 in the same period, a decrease of 15,000.Agricultural Wages Board.At Bideford, Devonshire1, on the 19th August a case was heard against an employer for the underpayment of 4 workers,     A technical offence was admitted in the case of three of the workers;   in the case of the fourth the employer pleaded that the man was not able-bodied and not worth the mini mum wage, and that he had failed to apply for a Permit of iixemption through inadvertence and not wilfully. The Bench convicted the employer in all four cases and imposed fines amounting to  5c 5s., and  3. 5s. costs, and ordered him to pay arrears of wages to all four workers, amounting to  77. 7. 10.A case was heard on the 19th August at Stafford against an employer for underpayment of two workmen.     In the first case the employer pleaded guilty, but the following extenuating circumstances:-   (a) he did not know he was underpaying this man, and (b) he gave the man all he had asked for and the man was perfectly satisfied.     The Bench convicted, imoosed a fine of  5 and ordered payment of arrears of  24.     The Chairman said it was a bad case, and he considered the employer had been let off very lightly.In the second case, the worker was on a yearly contract.     The first contract ended last March, and he was continuing on the same terms for another year. .   The yearly &apos; wage reckoned on   a weekly basis was less than the minimum rate fixed by the Board&apos;s Orders.     The employer pleaded not guilty, and his1-defence was that the worker was not physically fit.     a Permit of Exemption had been applied for since the inspector&apos;s visit.     The employer was convicted and fined  1.An employer was prosecuted at credit on, Devonshire, on August 20th, for underpayment of two workmen.     Two    &apos; summonses were issued-in respect of each worker.     The workers had received privileges of several kinds which were not allowable as part payment of wages.-    The defence maintained that there was a verbal agreement that these privileges should be valued at 6,/- per week.     In- the first summons in each case the defendant was fined  1 and ordered to pay arrears at 3/- per week.     The other summons wa3 dismissed.During the week 76 cases of complaint tf ,non-payment of the minimum rat-js were received, the largest number from a single county be:&apos;ng 13 in the case of Bedfordshire.     One hundred cases were sent to Inspectors for visit;   enquiries by correspondence were made in HG2 cases;   and 38 cases were completed.     Reports were received from Inspectors in 85 cases.
