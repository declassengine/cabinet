THE DANGER TO ARMENIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a letter which I have received from the British-Armenian Chamber of Commerce.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.25th August, 1919.The London Chamber of Commerce, Sir, 19th August, 1919.The commercial community interested in trade with the Near East, and more especially the Armenian merchants in this country are greatly agitated by the news published in the Press that His Majesty&apos;s Government intends to withdraw forthwith all British troops at present stationed id those parts of Asia Minor which are popularly described as i Armenia. By such withdrawal it is feared that the territory thus denuded would at once become the prey of Kurdish brigands, disbanded Turkish soldiers and similar undesirable elements. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the results that may be expected if such a state of anarchy were to supervene. From the Armenian point of view the consequences would be so appalling as to cause the unfortunate Armenian people to despair of their future. The country inhabited by the ancient, industrious and frugal Armenian race is known to be rich and fruitful. Once peace has been established in those regions flourishing industries are certain to spring up, to say nothing of the splendid field for engineering and mining operations which Asia Minor presents. Regrettable as the abandonment of Armenia must appear &apos;both from a humanitarian and . economic point of view, its political effects would be equally disastrous. Now that Great Britain has concluded a very satisfactory treaty with Persia it seems more than ever imperative, if only for the sake of British prestige, that . His Majesty&apos;s Government should not hand over a neighbouring country to anarchy and ruin.As Chairman of the British Armenian Chamber of Commerce, I have been requested to represent the above circumstances and urge the importance in the interests of all concerned of not denuding the unhappy Armenian country of British troops until , order has been restored, or at least until suitable arrangements for the protection and policing of Armenia by some other friendly Power shall have been made.I therefore venture earnestly to entreat His Majesty&apos;s Government to reconsider its decision, if, indeed, that decision should really have been taken. It is, of course, possible that the statements published in the Press were based upon a misunderstanding, in which case it may not be too late to allay the alarm which the news has caused.I have the honour, &amp;c,E. A. Brazley Hodgetts,Chairman.
