(TlllS DQCUIffiNT;, IS.THK WOVmi^J^Hg^gRITANMIG hlAjESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) SECRET-.tan     I mG.T. 8011a.-&apos;---w WAR CABINET.REPORT OF THE, SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE APPOINTED TO CONSU-ER THE ORGAN-IZATION OF THE REPARATION COMMISSION.(Further Note by Sir H. Llewellyn Smith),If Lord Sumner in his memorandum (G.T.7964) is right in interpreting paragraph (c) of &quot;General Principles&quot; as limiting the power of each of the participating Countries to appoint any staff a   any salaries they may think fit, I agree that it is wholly objectionable and must be deleted.   In view of the opening words of the paragraph, I had assumed that it only limited, their power of charging the Central Powers with the expenses of such staff, and that sckong as each Country pays the surplus cost out of its ovm fund a *-o question fa rises.   But as Lord Sumner takes the other view, I wish to aad my protest to his.(Intd)   H. L1.S.17th August, 1919.
