MEMOHAHPU 1.Owing to the political situation in America, it has not been found possible to have more than two meetings of the Organisation Committee of the Le ,gue of Nations which was est-abliehed by a plenary session of the Peace Conference,    All questions therefore have necessarily been left over till the first meetings of the Council.     As soon as the Treaty of Peace comes into force, the President of the United States will.- it . is assumed, convoke a meeting of the Council probably in either London or Paris.     -then this summons is received, the Acting Secretary General proposes to invite the Governments of the States represented on the Council tb attend the meeting at as early a date as possible.     This will probably be a week afwer the issue of the Presidents summons.     The Governments of the nine States to whom this invitation will be addressed will ha&quot; e to decide   whether they will send representatives to the meeting and, if so, whether these representatives will have full power to act on the Council, or whether they will attend in a purely advisory capacity.     It is understood that, from the legal point of view, the Council will be validly constituted whether the full number of representatives attend or not.There.are certain duties that it is   incumbent on the Council under the Treaty of Peace with Germany to perform immediately.1.     The constitution of the Delimitation Committee for the Sarre Basin territory..2.     The constitution of the Governing Commission of the -Sarre Basin territory.3.     The appointment of a High Commissioner for Danzig;A decision will be required as to whether the Council should confine itself to these duties and to certain urgent questions connected with the organisation of the International Secretariat, postponing the discussion of other matters until all the Powers represented on the Council have ratified the Treaty, or whether it should proceed with the discussion of other problems without delay.     Such problems are(i)   The constitution and appointment of a Permanent Naval, Military and Air Commission which has to air&quot;&apos;se the Council on the reluct ion of national armaments, the manufacture h$ private enterprise of munitions and implements of war, and lastly on the regulations to be prescribed by the League in regard to naval and military forces and arma-raents of any. Power seeking admission thereto, ($inland, Georgia, Iceland and San Marino will probably apply for admission at the first meeting of the Assembly.)(ii)   The appointment of a Committee of Internationaljurists to advise on the preparation of plans for the constitution of the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice.(iii)   The date of and agenda for the first meeting of   $ the Assembly. itiv)   Various other minor questions.- There is one other subject which will require an early decision, namely the question of the admission of the Press to the meetings of the Council.   It seems necessary that this point should be determined at the first meeting of the Council.
As regards the date of and agenda for the Assembly, it should be noted that the President of&apos;the United States has called a meeting of the Labour Conference for the 29th October. The question for decision is&quot; whether the Assembly should follow after the Labour Conference as soon after the ratification of the treaty of Peace by the Senate as is possible, allowing for the necessary material arrangements, or whether it should be postponed until the work of organisation has reached a more complete stage. . .If the first alternative is adopted, certain other matters require examination Such as(a) the probable deration of the meeting o^the Assembly;(b) the period which should elapse between the first and second meetings of the Assembly;(c) where the second meeting of the Assembly should take place;(d) whether the Council should sit at Washington during the meetings of the Assembly.The question of admission of enemy countries to the ^League is likely to be raised at the first meeting of the Assembly and should be considered in connexion with it..E.14th August-, 1919.
