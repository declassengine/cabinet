Attack on,Bolshevik Ships in Kronstadt

S.N.O. reports having attacked Kronstadt with C.M.B&apos;S and aircraft before dawn on 18th.

The Battleship "Andrei Pervosvanni" was torpedoed,and aerial photographs showed her bows to be under water, and that she was on fire. She is now in dock. Battleship "Potropatlovsk" was also hit, and seen to have a heavy list.

The submarine depot ship "Pamiatazov" was torpedoed, and shown from photographs to be on her beam ends. She has sunk, and her upper works are awash.

The photographs showed another cruiser bottom up. The shallow water in the harbour probably saved the ships from sinking; this has not been confirmed.

A destroyer was torpedoed outside the harbour and sunk.

Our losses were 3 C.N.B&apos;s, and our casualties 6 Officers and 10 ratings killed.

Finnish papers state that the moral effect on the Bolsheviks of this attack has been very great.

Measures to prevent Trade with Bolshevik Russia.

The Supreme Council in Paris decided on 19th August to send a note to the German Government and the Neutral States, in the name of the principal Allied and Associated Powers,

asking .....
asking :-(a) That clearance papers should be refused to vessels intend-ing to proceed to ports in Bolshevik Russia.(b) That an equivalent-embargo should be placed upon goodsintended to be transmitted &quot;by land to Russian destination.(c) That passports should be refused to individuals desirous of travelling to or from Bolshevik Russia.(d) That Banks should be prohibited from dealing with the affairs of, or transacting business with Bolshevik russia.(e) That as far as possible acceptance of Mails and tele-graphic communications destined for, or coming from Bolshevik Russia should be refused, and informing them :-(f) That the Allied and Associated Powers had the intentionof putting into force, in their own countries, measures: similar to those that Neutral Governments were now invifted to adopt.(g) That ships of the Allied Navies, enforcing the intendedembargo on the ports of Bolshevik Russia, would act under the authority of the Allied and Associated Governments..... A note in the above sense has been drafted but referred back to the Blockade Council owing to technical difficulties which esis-t in America in imposing the embargo.It is proposed to.instruct S.N.O., Baltic, that, pend-ing the receipt and consideration of replies from the German Government and Neutral States, he is to take all possible measures jfchort of sinking of ships to prevent vessels proceeding to Petrograd.Earth West Russia, .General Gough has been informed by War Office that he should not have made promises to this newly-formed state, which might later give them cause to accuse the Allies of having deserted them.H.H. Government has replied to the Deputy Commissioner to the Baltic States that they are most surprised at the action which has been taken in his support of the new North West Russian Government, and can not&apos; assent to the recognition of this Government or at present of the independence of Esthonia, both of which were specially asked for by H.M. Commissioner.   The stability of the new North West Russian Government which has temporarily made its headquarters at Rev^L is questionable. In the meantime the Esthonian Government has refused-.to.recognise the North West Russian Government until the Allies recognise the Independency of listhonia.LatviatGeneral von der Goltz has left for Berlin, but it is not yet clear whether he has been recalled or has merely gone to confer with Ms Government.The German Government in a note to the Armistice Commission dated August 17th, states it cannot recognise it is bound to allow the passage of material for the Polish Army via Danzig.   The Germans are prepared to negotiate with the dele-gates of the Polish Government now in Berlin, and propose a special commission for military purposes-.be formed&apos;to settle the question.
The question of the revision o  the Treaties of 1839 is &quot;being considered by a Committee.  At-present it appears that Belgium is likely to receive little satisfaction for her claims witfi regard to the Scheldt, Iceland and Limburg. - If this should prove to be the case it is feared that it would produce so great an effect o  public opinion in Belgium that the Government might be compelled to withdraw from the negotiations Meanwhile the ill-feeling against Holland is becoming stronger owing to the tone of the Butch Presst -On October 1st, G.H.Q, will cease to exist as a supreme operations authority.  G.H.Q. hasalready ceased to exist in the   old form and bears the name of&quot;H.Q. Demobilisation&quot;The various branches will either be disbanded or taken over by civil Departments.   The Enemy Order of Battle, and Intelligence Departments pass to the Foreign Office as one civil Department.  Railways will go over to the Railways Ministry. Survey Department to the Ministry&apos;of Interior.Following telegram was sent on 20.8.19 to b.N.0?sabroadAllied i^aval Armistice Commission is now giving permission to certain German merchant vessels for voyages beyond North Sea and Baltic.

It is a vessel belonging to Robert M. Sloman.Enemy Tonnage Conference are&apos;pressing the proposition that the Germans should be definitely told that floating docks and port appliances at German ports will be demanded as&quot;repEra-tion for the. Scapa Flow incident.In accordance with an order made by the President the Imperial Jiavy Office (Reichsmarineamt) is to take the title of &quot;Admiralty&quot; (Idmiralitat).    Hie Admiralty is the highest executive ana Administrative Authority of the Navy.

Steps taken by the Chef der Admiralitat up to the present are hereby authorised. The Admiralstab is being dissolved.   Its transactions will be settled by the Admiralty.&quot;Negotiations are now in progress between the Imperial and State Authorities concerned and those Officers and Warrant Officers who will be obliged to resign on account of the reducr tion of the Navy.    These negotiations have the object of granting to, at least, those who have served 10 years (inclusive of War Service and double time)   a retaining feo ax&quot; to be subiect, however, to the condition that after a certain time they will be pensioned according to their length of service.

At a meeting held on 19th August General Miller and the representatives of the Duma said they had decided to evacuate ....
evacuate their women ani children, hut to continue the defence of Archangel themselves after our withdrawal.

There is a general desire to reach quickly some settlement which would finally dispose of this voxed^question.i?-:Annunzio in a recent speech &apos;    is reported to have said that &quot;200 aerial torpedo craft would be sufficient to get the better of, all the British Naval power in our Mediterranean&quot;. It must be remembered however, that IVAnnunzio is apt in moments of exaltation, ti indulge in flambouyant heroics, and must not be taken too seriously. .The Socialist Paper &quot;Avanti&quot; recently reported a mutiny of British sailors at Baku.   The British Government has given orders for this report to be contradicted. &quot;An expression of Their Lordships sincere sympathy with the Italian Nary at the lors of &quot;Basilicata&quot;  as been sent to the Italian Ministry.of Marine.On the announcement that Admiral Di Revel had vacated the post of naval Commander-fn-Chief, a Rome newspaper (apparently unaware that he is remaining as Chief of the Naval General Staff) published the following&quot;We hope that this is the first step towards the total sweeping away of all those Naval partisans who, during these last years, have done so much to damage the Navy ana Italy, and into whose naval and political activities it is necessary that the coming Chamber of Deputies should order a severe and systematic enquiry&quot;.&quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; arrived at Halifax on loth August. &quot;Libia&quot; left Portsmouth 18th August for Lisbon.&apos;BULGARIA.A proposal is under examination whereby Bulgaria is to receive the port of Dodeagatch and a corridor connecting that port with Bulgarian territory.The members of the Commission of Enquiry into events at Smyrna have been nominated, and areItalian.....
