M ^^L^ 296/(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BBITAHBIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVBRMMBHg). SECRET.G.T.-8091. WAR    C ABIfiBI.THE DISPOSAL Off ADMIRALTY OWNED TRAWLERS AMD DRIFTERS * Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.1,   The proposals set out in the Memorandum (G.Tn8C57) by the First Lord of the Admiralty raise questions which seriously affect the Scottish fisheries, and upon which I wish my views to be oon-sidered , I was previously unaware of the modified proposals which appear to have been under discussion since the Majority and    * Minority Reports of the Reconstruction Committee were made six months ago.      The Scottish representatives then dissented from the proposals of the Majority Report, for reasons whioh are stated in the Minority Report, of which I append a copy.2*   As the Minister responsible for the Scottish fisheries I greatly appreciate the recognition by the Admiralty of the assistance rendered by the fishing industry to the Navy during the war,     I feel bound, however, to take strong exception, from the standpoint of the fisheries, to the proposals now made by the Admiralty,3*   In my view steam drifters should not be included in the proposed Co-Partnership scheme, but the whole number available (about 100) should be disposed of, on terms of deferred payment., to small groups of fishermen who are anxious to aoqulre them - t as working-owners.   In Scotland, where the greater part of tho existing steam drifters are owned, the prevailing system is &quot;fisherman ownership&quot; in the sense that the vessels are owned by members of their crews.     In principle this is an exoellent system because it obviously encourages enterprise and good management.   In practice it has proved extremely successful, both in its industrial and in its social aspects,    Owing to losses, to wear and tear, and to the suspension of building during the war, there is at present a shortage in the fleets of steam drifters which even the whole number of the available Admiralty drifters (about 100) will scarcely suffice to make good.   I am strongly of opinion, therefore, that the need for additional vessels should be met by disposing of the Admiralty drifters according to   a.method which conforms to the prevailing system of ownership.    Under the proposed Co-Partnership Company scheme the men who work in a particular vessel would not be her owners, but would have only a small interest in her as shareholders in the Company^   In principle this appears to me to be far less satisfactory than the system of &quot;fisherman ownership&quot;..      Moreover, the method which I recommend is one of proved success as compared with one which is admittedly experimental.4,   I am also anxious to extend the system of &quot;fisherman ownership&quot; in the above sense to steam trawlers, so far as practicablev   The trawling industry is mostly in the hands of Joint Stock Companies owning fleets of varying size.   I am advised, however, that a nu ber of fishermen arc anxiouc to acquiro steam trawlers as working ownors following the successful example of other fishermen.   It appears to mo that this healthy development should be encouraged,   i recommnnd that 100 of the Admiralty trawlers shoull be offered for disposal to small groups of fishermen on terms of. doferrad payment.
2S76.   If the Admiralty are satisfied that the proposed Co-Partnership scheme has a reasonable prospect of success on the terms now contemplated., I would not press objection to it in principle.   It appears to me, however, that a Company of the magnitude suggested, extending&apos; over the whole of Great Britain, would be too unwieldy from the standpoint of economical manage-ment.   This objection would hold good, in ray view, even if the Company&apos;8 total fleet were reduced, as proposed above, by 50 drifters and 100 trawlers, leaving 150 trawlers.   the  scheme is to some extent experimental, end to organise it in the form of a single company is to place too many eggs in one basket.    I consider that the vessels should be divided among a numbed of Co-Partnership companies attached to different ports or groups of ports.    Local interest and rivalry among the different groups will promote good and economical management.   Each Company will be able to profit by the experience of the others. The number of companies to be set up in England and Wales is clearly a matter for the President of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries to consider.   So far as Scotland is concerned, however, X am clearly of opinion that there should be a separate company to which a due proportion of the trawlers should be allocated.6.   In the limited time available I have not been able to get advice upon the details of the proposed scheme.   I assume, however, that if the scheme is modified as I suggest, the vessels will he offered on the $sue terms as regards price, rate of interest, etc., to the Co-Partnership Company and to the small groups of fishermen.   I have some reason to believe -though I cannot, $en&amp;itLg enquiry, give a definite assurance -that the small groups of fishermen would be able to pay at once some proportion of the price as suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   If the proposed shareholders in the Qe^rtaer-ship Companies are able to do likewise it will be a guarantee of iheir real and continued Interest in the welfare of the con-cern.   It seems very important that they should enter upon the undertaking with a full sense of the responsibilities involved. They may have to face fierce opposition from existing trawling companies, as well as other difficulties.7.   la allocating the&apos; drifters and trawlers to small groups of fishermen, preference should, In my view, oe given  getaris paribus to men who have served meritoriously in H.M.?oroes. Special&apos; consideration should bo given to applicants who will con-stitute a complete crew, or a large preortion of one.   The skill of the skipper and crew as fishermen should be regarded as an important criterion in making any necessary selection amo4g applicants.8.   The modifications which I suggest in the Admiralty proposals are briefly;-(1)    Steam drifters should not be inoluded in tiy Oo-Partnership Company so he.me, but should be ^is-poeeA of individually to small groups of fishe^ men desiring to become their working-owners.(Z)    100 of the steam trawlers should be similarly disposedof.(3)    The propose^ Copartnership Company should divided into two or more ooErwnioa, attached tj different p6rtB or groups of ports.

DISPOSAL OF ADMIRALTY-OWNED TRAWLERS AND DRIFTERS.ADMIRALTY RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE. Minority Report.1. We regret that we are unable io concur in the foregoing (Majority) Report. As regards steam trawlers we agree with certain of its principles, hut differ materially as to their application. With regard to steam drifters we take an entirely different view from our colleagues.Special Objects?2. The general object in disposing of the trawlers and drifters built for the Admiralty is, of course, to realise this Government property, which is no longer required for naval purposes. In doing so we wish to achieve three special objects, namely (first), amicable adjustment of claims for compensation by fishermen whose vessels have been lost while on Admiralty service ; (secondly), recognition and reward of the services rendered by the men of the Minesweepers and Auxiliary Patrol; (thirdly), beneficial influence upon the development of the fishing industry.Government Assistance.3. The foregoing Report proposes that the Government in disposing of the 300 trawlers and the 150 drifters to a fishermen&apos;s company should allow an average discount on the estimated market value % of the former class of  2,230 per vessel. No similar discount is proposed in the case of the drifters. This amounts to a free gift by the Government to the men who have served in R.N.R. (T) of  670,000. Iu addition, it is proposed that tho Government should treat the balance of the price of the trawlers (average  9,000), the Avhole price of the drifters (average  4,000), and an amount provided for equipment and working capital as a Joan to be repaid in 20 years with interest at 4 per cent.We agree that the special objects stated in the foregoing paragraph justify this outlay by the Government. We agree also with the special recognition of post-war Miuesweeping proposed in paragraph 23.4. In considering the best methods of disposing of the vessels and of utilising the financial assistance proposed to be given by the Government, account must necessarily be taken of the circumstances of the fishing industry.Steam trawling is conducted, for the most part, by Joint Stock Companies both in England and Wales and in Scotland. In some instances, however, steam trawlers are owned by members of their crews. In the case of steam drifters, Company ownership is also the general rule in England aud Wales. In Scotland, however, fully 80 per cent, of the steam drifters are the property of members of their crews. Seeing that, in 1914, 981 steam drifters were owned in Scotland as compared with 565 in England and Wales, it will be realised that the usual type of Scottish ownership &quot; fisherman ownership &quot; as it is called is a factor of the first importance in the herring fishing industry. The development of the industry in Scotland has been such that the advantage? of mechanical power, larger vessels, &amp;c, have been secured without the fishermen owners being crushed out by large Joint Stock Companies aud converted into &quot; hired hands.&quot; It is undeniable that the preservation of fisherman ownership has been beneficial, in a high degree, to the industry and to the Nation. Largely through the efforts of fisherman owners, the productivity of the herring fisheries increased by leaps and bounds in the years before the War. Prosperity ruled not only among the fishermen, but among the herring curers aud other associated workers. Moreover, the system of fisherman ownership promoted the growth of thriving fishing towns and villages and arrested the general tendency towards over-concentration in the bigger towns with its attendant evils.The essential ground upon which we differ from our colleagues is that we wish to maintain&apos; and extend the system of fisherman ownership, as described above, while the recommendations of the Majority Report would, in our opinion, discourage or possibly even destroy it. Our recommendations thus rest upon the principle that the ownership of fishing vessels, each by its own crew, is the most equitable and the most advantageous to the community wherever it is attainable in practice, that is to say, wherever the fisheries can be vigorously and successfully prosecuted under that system.5. Applying this principle we desire, in the first place, ito meet the case of fishermen owners whose vessels have been lost while on Admiralty service, especially if the owners have also given service. Negotiations between the Admiralty and the drifter owners&apos; representatives have failed hitherto to produce a settlement of the owners&apos; claims on the basis of &quot;monetary compensation. Without entering upon the merits of the disputed questions, which are subjudice, we suggest that an amicable settlement (which is much to be desired in the interests of good relations between the Naval Authorities and fishermen) can best be reached either by awarding such terms of compensation as would enable the men to replace their vessels, or by allowing the lost vessels to be replaced by Admiralty drifters, subject to suitable financial adjustments to meet differences in tonnage, depreciation, &amp;c. This would enable the men to resume their occupation with vessels of their own. We suggest therefore that a proportion of the Admiralty drifters be set aside for this purpose.6. The remainder of the steam drifters (whose numbers may be taken tentatively as 150) should, in our view, be offered at a fair price to small bodies of fishermen who will become their joint-owners and crews. The price would be paid off by instalments spread over a period of years with a low rate of interest.For the general reasons given above, we regard this method of disposal as greatly preferable to that of sale to the Company proposed in the Majority Report. Under the former the whole interest in each vessel would be acquired by its crew, under the latter ouly a small fraction of it.   The profitable workingo  [14.3.19]  (33) AS 7646-1 (AS 7235-14) Pk 3489  50 9/19  E&amp;S
of etoarn drifter sdoes not depend upon the holding of interests in subsidiary businesses ; and, in fact, the whole experienceof the industry demonstrates that fisherman ownership of drifters is not merely possible, but is highly suitable and successful. Moreover, recognising that, as stated in paragraph 13 of the Majority Report and in paragraph 12 of Sir A. Whinney&apos;s Memorandum, the proposed Company will be regarded by existing owners as a powerful competitor, we hold that the resources of the State should riot be employed to assist the proposed Company at the expense of the existing fishermen owners of steam drifters. That would amount, in our opinion, to encouraging the supersession of an excellent system by one which is inherently inferior to it, especially in its social effects.]n order to avoid any possible misapprehension we wish to make it plain that these proposals are not intended to apply only to Scotland. We should welcome the growth of the system of fisherman ownership of steam vessels in all parts of the country.7. Turning next to steam trawling, we recognise that the extension in that industry of the principle of ownership of the vessels by their crews presents greater difficulties. Most of the existing steam trawlers belong to Joint Stock Companies. The profitable working of the vessels depends to some extent upon obtaining ice, stores, &amp;c., at reasonable prices, and to a considerable extent the subsidiary concerns which supply these essentials are controlled by the existing Trawling Companies.But we feel that paragraphs 9-11 of the Majority Report exaggerate the difficulties of working a steam trawler owned singly and the dependence of the owners of such a vessel upon Ice Companies and other subsidiary businesses run by their trade rivals. According to our information, steam trawlers worked singly and independently have, in numerous instances, proved very successful; aud it is quite possible for such trawlers to get their necessary supplies on favourable terms from co-operative organisations like the Grimsby Coal, Salt and Tanning Company.In view of the advantages of fisherman ownership as described above, we consider that the disposal of the Admiralty trawlers should be so arranged as to encourage that system. We therefore propose that a proportion, say 100, of the Admiralty trawlers should be offered to fishermen at a fair price to be repaid by instalments at a low rate of interest.8. The remainder (say 200) should, we think, be made available to be worked, if a sufficient number of fishermen so desire, by two or more Companies constituted on the lines suggested in the Majority Report. There should be separate Companies for England and Wales and for Scotland, and if the men concerned in either country desire to have distinct Companies for different groups of ports this should be considered.It appears to us that a Company embracing the whole Kingdom, and almost necessarily controlled by a Board of Directors in London would be unwieldy aud expensive in administration. On the other band, smaller Companies worked from the principal ports would profit by the local interest and the healthy rivalry which would be excited. Keen fishing and good care of the vessels and gear would be stimulated. Each Company would profit from the experience of the other.9. We attach importance to the principle that, if the Government decides to grant a reward to the men M&apos;ho have served in R.N.R. (T), the men should not be required to take it in the form of shares in tile proposed Company or Companies, but should have some reasonable alternative, such as the receipt of an equivalent amount in War Bonds or War Savings Certificates. Many of the proposed beneficiaries are line fishermen, who have no connection either with steam trawlers or with steam drifters. They may prefer to receive War Bonds and utilise them in part payment for motor engines lor their sailing boats, or for other equipment. The reward will produce greater satisfaction if it does not take the form of a compulsory investment. Moreover, if the men are required to take their reward iu shares in the Company the Government runs considerable risk of being held morally responsible for the success or failure of the Con pany. That responsibility must, in our view, be accepted by the fishermen-shareholders as free agents. We would add here that in our view the estimate in para. 24 of the Majority Report that, at the end of 20 years, each  1 share in the Company will, in fact, be worth  4, is too confident a prediction. The successful management of such a company will necessarily present serious difficulties, and ups-and-downs must be expected. We do not think it would be expedient for the Government to suggest to the fishermen, still less to guarantee, that the above estimate Mali be realised.10. In proposing that a large proportion of the Admiralty vessels should be disposed of to the crews who are to work them, we have in view that the risk of disputes between employers and employed is eliminated in so far as the two classes coalesce. On the other hand, the Co-partnership Company recom-mended in the Majority Report, and to a lesser extent in this, will be exposed to the risk of industrial disputes, even though it adopts good standards of remuneration and of working conditions. Indeed, co-operative undertakings engaged in production are notoriously subject to special difficulties in this respect, owing to the fact that the directors who control the workers are themselves responsible to the body of shareholders to which the workers belong.11. We append a consecutive summary of our recommendations. We venture to think that they are not open to the objections contained in para. 28 of the Majority Report. As stated above, the scope of our proposals is not confined to Scottish drifter men nor to Scottish fishermen. So far from a large number of members of R.N.R. (T.j receiving no benefit at all under our scheme, we propose that all such members should receive their due proportion of the total reward of  670,000, in accordance with length of service, and should be free to take it in shares or iu War Bonds as they prefer. When steam drifters and steam trawlers are offered, as a business transaction, to groups of fishermen intending to become their joint-owners and crews, it is likely that a considerable proportion of the fishermt-n will not submit applications, because they are unwilling to undertake the responsibilities of ownership. Others will refrain because they are already part owners of vessels. Assuming that the number ot applications exceeds the number which can be granted, one of the main criteria in. making a selection should, we suggest, be the qualifications of the skippers and crews as fishermen. A similar criterion will, we presume, be adopted when the proposed Company is faced with the task of selecting its skippers and crews from the large number of fishermen-shareholders available, and in each case the reasonableness of the criterion will, we believe, appeal to the meu. Lastly, we may remark, there is no question of the man without means being debarred on that account. All the applicants ought to be prepared to use their proportions of the reward of  670,000 in part payment of the price of the vessel. The balance of the price would be piid by instalments as explained in this Report.
13. We submit that the foregoing recommendations provide a satisfactory scheme for disposing to good advantage of the Admiralty trawlers and drifters and for conferring a real benefit on the fishermen, the industry, and the community We feel that they will enable the desired objects to be achieved without imposing on the fishing industry the serious risks of injury which, in our view, would be involved in the adoption of the proposals of the Majority Report.(Signed)     P. J. ROSE,Assistant Secretary Scottish Office.DAVID T. JONES, Payr. Lt.-Cdr., R.N.R.,Secretary of the Fishery Board for Scotland.4th March 1919.12. Our recommendations, necessarily stated in outline, are as follows : Disposal of Steam Trawlers.(1) 100 trawlers to be offered for sale singly at a fair price to groups of fishermen desirous of acquiring a trawler to be worked by thein. The price, (which would average  11,230 as in the Majority Report, but should vary for the 3 classes of trawler) to be paid off first, by setting off against it the applicants&apos;&quot; credits,&quot; i.e., their shares in the total reward of  670,000, aud then by instalments spread over 20 years with interest at 4 per cent. Preference to be given ceteris paribus to fishermen who have served meritoriously in R.N.R, (T) or have lost a trawler through war risks. Special consideration to be given to applicants who will constitute a complete crew or a large proportion of one.(2) The remaining 200 trawlers to be divided between Companies formed in England and Wales and in Scotland upon the lines indicated in the Majority Report. The trawlers to be transferred at a fair price (provisionally fixed at  11,230 on the average).(3) The R.N.R. (T) men who are to be rewarded to a total extent of  670,000 to be invited to convert their rewards  1 for  1 into shares in the Companies. If the total applications represent (say) rewards of  400,000, the total price of the 200 trawlers ( 2,246,000) will be paid first by setting the  400,000 against the total, and then by payment of the balance  1,846,000 by instalments spread over 20 years with interest at 4 per cent.(4) Advances for equipment and working capital to be made on similar terms of repayment to the Companies acquiring fleets and to the fishermen owners acquiring single vessels.(5) In each case the Government advances to be secured by debentures or mortgages on the vessels. The sale or transfer of any vessel to be subject to the consent of the Government.  The vessels to be kept in good repair and insured.   Insurance policies to be lodged with the Government.. (6) After approval of the main principles of these schemes by the Government, the complete schemes to be worked out in conference with representatives of the men. A decision then to be taken whether more than one company should be constituted for each country.Disposal of Steam Drifters.(7) A proportion of the steam drifters to be set aside so as to provide compensation in kind for owners of steam drifters whose vessels have been lost while on Admiralty service.(8) The remainder of the steam drifters to be sold at a fair price (taken provisionally as in the Majority Report at  4,000) to groups of men wishing to become working-owners of them. The applicants&apos; shares in the reward of  670,000 to be taken in part payment of the price. The balance to be paid by instalments spread over 20 years with interest at 4 per cent. The arrangements in (4) and (5) above to apply also to steam drifters. &apos; vPreference to be given ceteris paribus to men who have served meritoriously in R.N.R. (T). Special consideration to be given to applicants who will constitute a complete crew or a large proportion of one. The skill of the skipper and crew as fishermen to be a criterion in making any necessary selection among applicants.General.(9) Men whose rewards are not utilised in part payment for vessels, or in exchange for shares in the Company, to receive the amount in War Bonds or War Savings Certificates. In order that men may not spend their rewards in other ways before they have had an opportunity of using them in one or other of the ways indicated above, it would be advisable to postpone the issue of the War Bonds until after the offer of vessels or of shares in the Company had been made. An exception should be allowed where, e.g., a line fisherman can show, to the satisfaction of the Fishery Department, that he needs his reward in order to provide motor installation or equipment for his existing boat.
