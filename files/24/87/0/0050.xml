is Document is the Pmpej^y^        : &apos; A/.SECRET.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.THE FUTURE OF THE ARMY.I do not understand why the Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos; in his Paper on the Future of the Army (G.T. 8039) says that &quot;we have, to-day much more clanger-facing us in India than anything that we could have foreseen in 1914,&quot; I have.no information which leads me to endorse this. India shows no signs of menace with one single exception.If in the teeth of solemn pledges, against the advice of the War Office and Admiralty and the Government of India, and contrary to the opinions of tho majority of the Cabinet, our plenipotentiaries succeed in obtaining a peace with Turkey which outrages Indian opinion, tho Chief of the Imperial General Staff is probably right. We shall have lost I he confidence of Mahomedans by a treatment of Adrianople, Smyrna, Thrace, Asia Minor, and Constantinople, which will not be in accord with the aims for which we alleged the war was fought and not in accord with the aims for which we asked Indian volunteers to fight with us.I can understand this being a palatable result to French and Italians who are jealous of British relations with Islam.But I cannot understand it in view of the Prime Ministers assurances to India and the reiterated opinions of all the Members of the Government who have expressed an opinion-save two.E.
