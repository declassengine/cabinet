IB   MB.mmte V tfts, President, pf a&amp;iaa&amp;jtl Wwrtiwi,tot is to be the fate of Cyprus ? I trust that this Island, the vast majority of whose inhabitants are Greek in race Language, religion and sympathy, may be permitted to pass under the Greek Flag.The strategical arguments against cession are not in themselves, so far as I apprehend them, of the first order and such strength aB they possess is greatly diminished by the prospect of a long peace which lies before us.  It is argued that Cyprus is the key to Alexandretta, which in turn is the key to the defence of Igypt, that in the hands of a strong naval power it might bectme an important base, that it will serve as a useful link in the chain of our imperial air stations.  It may, however,: be remarked that the defence of the Egyptian frontier during the late War was not conducted from Alexandretta and that the change in the political status of Palestine robs that city of such importance as might previously have been claimed for it as the outer bastion of the defence of Egypt. Hot can the naval argument be&apos; regarded as convincing.  If it were proposed to cede Cyprus to a strong naval power there might be something in it, but this is! not the proposal. The suggestion is that Cyprus should be ceded; to Greece, which is and will always remain a *eak power.  As to the claims of the Air Service, these could be amply satisfied by express stipulations in the Treaty of Cession.The one political argument of weight in favour of the.... retention of the Island in our hands is the position of the Moslem minority.  It would be necessary to take special measures to secure protection for the non-christian population of the Island,Such
Such being the arguments for retention, what is the case for cession ? I confess that it appears to me to be strong.  Under any conceivable arrangements of the political map which may be effected as the result of this War, the British Empire will emerge with a treEeiidouc accession of power and territory.  At the very least it will absorb many important German Colonies end all Mesopotamia.   It may take a mandate for Palestine as well. Meanwhile we preach the doctrine of self-determination.  The German and Austrian Treaties are based on it.  The Allied policy in Bussia is based on it.  Shall we not greatly strengthen our moral prestige all over the world if we show that the handling of our own possessions is based on it also ? For at least two centuries the standing charge against British diplomacy is , Pharisaism.  We protest our virtue always, but somehow or other more and more of the map gets painted red.  Here is an opportunity for attacking the legend, for showing the world that in good cause shown we can. cede territory as well as take it.  1 should imagine, though I speak in ignorance of the most recent diplomatic trans-actions, that we should be in a stronger position to make such representations as ^e desire te make to France about Syria, to Greece about Macedonia, to Italy about Asia Minor, and to 4merica about ireland if we could first exhibit on example of fidelity to principle, in the case of our own possessions, ??e cannot plead &apos;&apos; that we have done much for Cyprus in that Cyprus has done much for us, % should, it is true, lose a trifling revenue by cession. Against this may be put the fact that we should be giving to Greece now rh&amp;t we promised to give her in 1915, that we should be satis1? \ fying the political aspirations of the Christian population of thi Island, and finally that we should be acting up to the declared principles upon which, in concert with our Allies, we have set out to reconstruct the political fabric of Europe.H.
