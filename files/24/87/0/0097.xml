344Military Secret.1067^ /x ^FroM Viceroy, Army Dep28th August 1919. (Repeated to Tehran.) (Received 2nd September.)Department, to Secretary of State for India,HALL G^762.&apos; 28th August.1. In connection with question of relieving certain units in East Persia, we have received enquiry from Malleson as to future policy in that region.   He says : &quot; These proposals naturally invite consideration of future military policy in these parts. The whole of the facts are well known to you, and I merely invite attention to following points : (A) Denikin&apos;s refusal to send any reinforcements to Trans-Caspia, and the weakness and worthlessness of Savitski&apos;s Force, seem to make it probable Bolsheviks will eventually control whole of country to Caspian. (B) If the Bolsheviks succeed in opening up the Orenburg line, which seems probable, in view of Kolchak&apos;s retirement, the situation in Central Asia will change greatly for the worse. (C) In that case local Mohamedans would be powerless and would have to accept Bolshevik rule and conscription.&quot;2. We should be glad of indication of intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. Present role of Malleson&apos;s Force is defined by your telegram of the 9th February last, viz., to protect North-East Persia from Bolshevik incursions. Force also serves the purpose : (a) Encouraging Persia to resist Pan-Islamic and Bolshevik influence ; (b) enable us to keep in touch with events in Central Asia; and (c) afford moral support to Trans-Caspians by threatening flank and rear of Bolshevik advance towards Krasnovodsk.4. We consider that (b) could be adequately met by small Intelligence Organisation at Meshed, and we presume that other purposes for which Malleson&apos;s Force exists, if still necessary, (? would) be met sooner or later by the Persian Force to be raised under terms of the recent agreement. In this connection we would suggest that the existing Seistan and Khorasan levies be embodied in this force at an early date.5. If it is considered necessary to retain a portion of our troops at Meshed and on lines of communication for some time to come, we should be glad of a forecast of what this period is likely to be, and also of some indication of the size of the force we shall be asked to provide.6. We have at present, in North-East Persia and lines of communication, six squadrons, one Mountain Battery and six battalions. Of these the Mountain Battery and one battalion were sent as reinforcements to meet Afghan situation, and we retained one other back after relief for the same purpose. WTe are withdrawing latter battalion forthwith, and have enquired from General Officer Commanding, Baluchistan, what further reduction he considers possible on lines of communication, but before proceeding further we would like to receive indication of future policy.
