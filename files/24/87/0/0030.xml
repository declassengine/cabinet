After much trouble, the Sugar Con--  mission has now agreed to leave Gt Smith Street on tho 15th,Sept-ember, and tho Pensions Department will move in; other accommoda-tion being provided for the Sugar&apos;Commission.     The Admiralty aro shifting from a building near Chatham to enable the Aircraft to go there and the. promises vacated by the Aircraft are to bo taken by the Disposals Board at Barl&apos;s Court.The Admiralty-Controller has agreed to leave Gt.Georga Streetj partially at onco, and gradually up to Christmas, so as to leave, all space for the Education Ministry and the Board of Trade.   This seemed to me to be as much as they could do if officioncy wore to bo maintained.   It is accepted only by the Board of Education. The Board of Trado want immediate possession.   They can get accommoda-tion for 150 to 200 by the middle of September, with gradual evac-uation thereafter.     The Transport Department want the Board of Trade offices as vacated by the Board of Trade.   They want a more rapid evacuation of Gt.George Street so that the Board of 1&apos;rac.o may get in. there almost at once with their whole staff so as to leave existing space occupied by them now, for the new Transport Department,If the Board of Trade and the Transport Department are to bo accommodated as they desire, it means that tho Admiralty Controller must vacate ;Gt. George Street immediately.-The Cabinet must decide as between the claims of the Admiralty on tho one side and the Board of Trade and the Transport. Department on the other.   &quot;In any case, the Office of Works inform me that the change over would occupy two months;   I had arranged temporary accommodation for the Transport,(Initialled) G.N.B..2tWhitehall Gardens,S,7.1 *21st August 1919
