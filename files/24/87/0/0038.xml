The Lucerne and Amsterdam Conferences. *These two conferences which have just concluded their sittings represented the most recent international developments in the socialist and trade union spheres respectively.The conference of delegates at Lucerne, which was really preparatory to the Geneva Conference of the International fixed for February, 1920, opened its session on the 3rd August. There were 54 delegates, and a representative from British India was included. Since the proposed new statutes allocate a total of 408 votes, and allow a maximum number of delegates of double this number, the assembly was rather a commission than a conference. Hungary, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, were not represented. Mr. Henderson and Mr. Macdonald represented Great Britain, the former presiding at the meetings.* See also page 156.(c 1868) 255  8/19  H &amp; s &quot; Y
The tendencies which manifested themselves may be grouped round the various points of disagreement.One outstanding feature is that the Conference could not claim to be representative of the world proletariat. The second International is faced with a rival, the third Inter-national, centred in Moscow. The attitude of the delegates to the new body, therefore, was bound to reflect divergence of opinion upon the Russian situation. The German Independent Socialists only came to Lucerne with reluctance. Many apparently would have been glad to secede to a Muscovite allegiance, preferring a revolutionary policy to &amp; reformist, and abhorring the co-operation of the German Majority Socialists with the bourgeois in the present government of their country. In this sense Hilferding was opposed to Wels, the Majority Socialist, and to the revisionist, Bernstein. The French majority co-operated with the Independents in , support of a revolutionary policy, and the preamble to the new statutes was amended to incorporate revolutionary aims a? a result of their efforts. The representative attitude, however, was rather that of Fritz Adler (German Austria), who accepted both the second and the third International, and urged that a higher synthesis must be formed to avoid a permanent split. This reconciliation of Bolshevism with Socialism remains a task for Geneva if unity is to be preserved.Behind the question of unity lie two main factors the difference of opinion with respect to Bolshevism, and with respect to fixing responsibility for the war. The German Independents and the French Majority declared full sympathy with the Bolshevik achievement, with the reservation that their methods must not be copied for their own sake, Hilferding and Longuet being the chief advocates for this view. Vandervelde and Bernstein denounced recent tendencies, adhering to their faith in the suffrage and parliamentary activity. The question was largely fought on the recommendation .ot the majority of the political Commission that certain interrogations be addressed to the Soviet government, the chief of which were: Would that government give full opportunity to a commission of inquiry sent to investigate on behalf of the International, and would it undertake upon the cessation of intervention in Russia to allow freedom of expression in parliamentary elections ? The implication of the resolution incorporating these interrogatories, moved by Renaudel, was hotly attacked by delegates from the great nations, and supported by the small nations. An alternative resolution was put forward by Longuet and Macdonald, and in order to arrive at unanimity, adjustments were made in a direction sympathetic to the revolution. The interrogatories were omitted, though the decision to send a commission of inquiry was adhered to. The final resolution opposed intervention, as a violation of the self-determination of Russia, and declared that the International must defend the Russian proletariat which has suffered irom the violence of Czarism and of pan-Germanism, and now of the allied capitalistic governments. This resolution represented a movement of the Conference to the left, Mr. Macdonald co-operating to that end. The concessions made by Renaudel were apparently largely influenced by the coup cVetat at Budapest, and, in addition, he put forward a resolution, which was unanimously adopted, that this act be condemned as an outrage upon the proletariat and upon democracy. On the other hand, the French majority felt the resolution did not avow sufficient sympathy with the Russian revolution, and M.r. Macdonald expressed his agreement with its aims, leaving the question of methods of the Bolshevist dictatorship to be thrashed out at Geneva. The clause in the majority report welcoming the new socialist States, and claiming self-determination for them from the Russian Government, was also negatived. The minority report advocating federation gained acceptance. The attitude of the Conference.towards Bolshevism was not uniform. The left wing acclaimed its results, and reserved judgment upon the methods &apos; or blamed the old regime for their necessity : the revisionist right, in Bernstein, Vander-velde and Tseretelli, denounced the movement as tyranny by a minority. All agreed that intervention was wrong, and that even if it were right, the motives of the Allied governments condemned their action. The attitude of the left wing was not confined to sympathy with the Russian revolution, but would extend the policy of the International in a revolutionary direction.On the question of responsibility for the war, the Belgian attitude was expressed by Vandervelde. He claimed that the International could not prosper unless a public repentance were made by the German delegates. In reply to this, Molkenbuhr stated that the German socialists would not shield the German militarists. Wels took a more qualified attitude, and urged that had not the majority socialists given their support to the war, the Czar would now be arbiter of Europe. He called for a revision of the treaty of peace, but stated that it would be loyally observed until revision took place.With regard to the British report upon the treaty drawn up after the Conference of the Labour Party at Southport last June, the French Majority Socialists co-operated with
the German Independents to secure the insertion of an explicit condemnation of the imperialism said to be reflected in it, and, repudiating the actual constitution of the League of Nations. An amended text was substituted with the aid of Mr, Macdonald, of whom, in the words of &quot; L&apos;Humanite,&quot; &quot; 1&apos;evolution a gauche est remarquable.&quot; The other British representative, Mr. Henderson, in his opening address, maintained an orthodox labour attitude upon social and foreign affairs, though it was possible in his opinion that the. coming winter might see a universal spasm of rage which would annihilate all, that remains of civilisation.The unity of the International is in suspense until the Geneva Conference has met. Even should the Belgian insistence upon German repentance be modified, the rival bodies can only unite if the left wing of the second International succeeds in formulating the higher synthesis which shall reconcile the Soviet and the Parliamentary socialist ideals.The Conference at Amsterdam which took place from the 22nd July to the 2nd August, was the first Conference of the reconstituted International Trades Union Federation. The British representatives were from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the General Federation of Trades Unions, and included Mr. Stuart Bunning, Mr. Appleton, Mr. Will Thorne, Mr. John Hill and others. There were also representatives from the principal Trade Union organisations of France, America, Belgium, Bohemia, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland. The Italian delegates did not arrive owing to passport troubles.The first object of the Conference was to wind up the old Federation, which had its headquarters at Berlin, and to form a new one, which would be less under German influence, in Amsterdam. In this it, on the whole, succeeded. There were, however, sharp contests on several points between the German delegates, who were supported by those of the Scandinavian countries, Holland and Switzerland, and the Allied representatives, in regard to the constitution of the Bureau. On the first day, the Belgians made a strong protest against the failure of the German Trade Unions to protest against the atrocities committed in Belgium. Their case was put with force and moderation and created a profound impres-sion. One of the German delegates responded by making a conciliatory declaration saying that the German workers had been deceived by their Government as to the origin of the war, and that if they had known then what they know now, that Germany was the aggressor, they would have adopted a very different attitude. This declaration was, however, repudiated on the following day by Legien (formerly general secretary of the International Federation), the chief German delegate, and by the majority of the other Germans. The impression made on the British representatives was that, on the whole, the German attitude and mentality was unchanged by the war. The bad impression which this attitude created affected the election of the Bureau. Appleton was elected President, with Jouhaux (General Secretary of the C.G.T., France) and Mertens (Belgium) Vice-Presidents, and two representatives of the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions, Oudegeest (who,has acted temporarily as Secretary of the dormant Federation) and Fimmen, as Secretaries. On being defeated by Jouhaux for the first vice-presidency, Legien refused to take any part in the Bureau, and the Scandinavian delegates (whose expenses were paid by the Germans), ostentatiously presented him with a large bowl of roses as a mark of their feelings.The most important debate was on the question of the International Labour Con-ference at Washington. A resolution was finally passed against the British and Americans, and with the abstention of the Belgians and Czecho-Slovaks, declining to take part in the Washington Conference unless the representatives of the Central Trade Union movement in all countries were invited and admitted without any exception. The object of this resolution was. of course, to obtain the admission of Germany, which, under the decision of the Peace Conference, can only take place after the Washington Conference, if that Conference agrees to it. It is known that the British, American and Belgian Trade Unions do not intend to abide by the resolution, and it is doubtful whether the French, Spanish and Czecho-Slovaks will abstain from participation.Part II Demobilisation and Resettlement,The Training of Unemployed Women.In this Report for the week ending the 21st May, some account was given of the general schemes sanctioned for the training of unemployed women under the Ministry of Labour, and of the steps which had. been taken to bring these schemes into operation. It was in-dicated, however, that the general schemes were considered in some ways insufficient,(C 1868) Y 2
and that for the successful institution of training, improvements would probably be found necessary. The provisions of the general schemes have since been revised, and the necessary alterations were sanctioned by the Treasury at the beginning of July. The original schemes suffered, in the first place, from the attempt which was made to restrict training to women in receipt of out-of-work donation when training began, although even at that.stage it was proposed to extend the maintenance allowance to cover the period of training if the women in question exhausted the unemployment donation period of six months before their training was complete. In actual practice it was found, however, that the utility of the schemes would be seriously impaired by this restriction. Owing, to inevitable delays in the discussion and institution of training courses, it was impossible to provide training for many who desired it before they had drawn out-of-work donation for the full period. Under the revised schemes, therefore, provision has been made that the women selected for training must have been entitled to some out-of-work donation, but they need not necessarily be entitled to it when the training course begins. In cases where the applicant for training can still claim out-of-work donation, her right to the donation will, however, be reduced byua period equal to that period spent in training.The second main defect of the original schemes arose from the attempt to make the maintenance allowance equivalent to the out-of-work donation. Thus, after the first 13 weeks of out-of-work donation had expired, the original maintenance grant of 25s. a week was reduced to 15s., and although in the case of a person under training who had to live away from home, a further subsistence allowance of 10s. a week might be paid, the net effect in many cases would be to reduce the subsistence allowance permanently to the level of 15s. Evidence soon accumulated to show that this figure was impossibly low, and that a very large number of the applicants for training were quite unable to face a period of several months on this small sum. Some of the Employment Committees with whom the question of training was under discussion expressed the opinion that they would be compelled, unless the sum was raised, to drop any idea of training, &amp;nd that the women would consequently be left to accept any employment, very possibly unskilled or badly paid, which might happen to be available. Under the revised schemes, therefore, the maintenance allowance is to be maintained at a level figure throughout, &quot;the amount being 20s. a week for women living at home, while for those obliged to live away from home owing to their training, the allowance is maintained at the former figure of 25s. In addition, as under the original schemes, women with dependent children will receive 6s. for the first child and 3s. for every other child. In cases where the trainee is provided with lodging in a Government hostel, board, lodging and laundry will be provided together with an allowance of 5s. a week in lieu of maintenance allowance of 25s. The revised rates, of course, apply to all women in training irrespective of the fact that their training may have begun before the new scheme was sanctioned.Many,serious difficulties have arisen with regard to industrial training. The field was, of course, in the first place, restricted to normal women&apos;s processes that is, processes In which women were normally employed before the war. Several women&apos;s industries, such as the great group of clothing trades, were very short of women workers, but hesitated to take on untrained women owing to the recent rise in the minimum rates. As most industries now have a fixed rate, equal to or greater than the maintenance allowance, industrial training has practically been confined to training in technical schools under ;schemes approved by the Local Trade Advisory Committees. This limited sphere has again its own difficulties, as the finding of suitable premises, and the provision of the necessary equipment and machinery, is by no means easy.The number of women who have applied for training, up to the 30th July, is 4,599. Of these 1,156 asked for domestic training, the remainder for industrial training. By far the larger number of industrial applications were for the clothing trades. Many of these are not, of course, current applications, as numbers have been placed in employment since their application. Some of these applicants were not prepared to wait for the training centre to be established; some have been placed untrained owing to improved trade conditions leading to increased employment; in other cases the fixing of a temporary adult learner&apos;s wage has enabled the employer to take on untrained adult women and train them themselves without any assistance from the Ministry.The latest available statistics show that of 1,159 women interviewed, 849 have been definitely accepted for training, and 266 were considered unsuitable. The numbers in training at the present time are 209 in domestic subjects, and 211 for industrial occupations. The number of women placed after the completion of oheir training is 82.It has not yet been possible to afford immediate training to all who desire it, but the schemes in operation, providing for the most part for short, courses, allow of the training of women in relays, and the provision already made is therefore more extensive than would
appear on -the surface. Twenty-eight schemes have been sanctioned, and are either already running, or are just about to be opened. Thirty-one other schemes have been forwarded to the department, and are under consideration; a number of other schemes are still under consideration locally, and have not yet been forwarded to headquarters. Of the 29 sanctioned schemes, 14 are for domestic training, and the remainder for industrial training, including wholesale clothing, glove-making, dressmaking, tailoring, upholstery, and watch and clock making. Domestic training centres are already open at Highgate, Redruth, Wrexham, Wakefield, Lincoln, and other places; and in Nottingham there is a short intensive training for waitresses. The&apos; following examples of the industrial training csntres may be cited. At Hammersmith, in co-operation with the London Coun+y Council, women are being trained in dressmaking, tailoring and upholstery. In Leeds, 80 women are receiving training in a technical school in wholesale tailoring. In Yeovil, training in glove-making is being given in a school provided by the Manufacturers&apos; Association. .Amongst the schemes which have been sanctioned and are coming into almost immediate operation the following are of special interest. At Rotherham, it is proposed to train 1,000 women in wholesale tailoring a new industry for women in that district. Wholesale tailoring training schemes are also to be opened in Bristol and Cardiff. . In Coventry a number of women who have been employed on machine work in fuse-making during the war will be trained on similar but much more minute machine work in the women&apos;s processes in watch and clock making./--Part III. Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Imperial and Foreign Affairs.Hungary.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; discusses the Hungarian situation in a leading article. This paper professes to find it difficult to write in restrained language about the Allied govern-ments. It believes that the Rumanians were acting at the instigation of the Allies in their attack upon Hungary and in occupying Budapest. It is maintained that while the Hungarian revolution had been unaccompanied by bloodshed and violence, the Rumanian occupation has been marked by serious outrages. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; acknowledges that the situation is full of complexities and mysteries, but deduces from it two clear things. The first is that the Allied Council has no authority over the actions of the smaller allies, and the second is that the Supreme Council, acting on behalf of the Great Powers, is determined to crush all democratic governments and to restore discredited dynasties which popular risings have overthrown. The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; shares the opinion of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; that the Allied Council in Paris instigated the Rumanian policy. Last week the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; refused to credit the fall of the Hungarian Soviet. This week, apparently as a result of articles in the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; it shows a belief that the Hungarian Soviet has indeed fallen. A contributor to this paper who describes himself as an eye-witness,, by which he appears to mean that he has been in Hungary during the recent regime, suggests that the Archduke Joseph is the nominee of the Allied governments. &quot;&apos;&quot; The Call&quot; argues that the fall of Soviet Hungary has been the direct consequence of external economic and military pressure. It draws from the affair the conclusions that the Capitalist League of Nations is grotesquely impotent as a basis for world peace and that the policy of the B.S.P. of opposition to the.Allies&apos; Russian policy has been eminently sane and wise. &quot; Hungary was crushed because of the apathy of workers in allied countries.&quot; This paper also publishes an open letter to Bela Kun. In this open letter the Hungarian collapse is regarded as an accidental reverse in a campaign for Socialism which is bound, in the long run, to be successful and a confident belief in the imminence of a &quot;world revolution is expressed.Russia.The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot;Nation&quot; both think that the military situation of the Russian Bolshevists is growing worse. The &quot; British Citizeu &quot; advocates a policy towards Russia which would preserve our national honour, which would prevent Germany exploiting Bolshevism and which would keep for us the privilege of developing the economic
resources of the country. Apparently this paper thinks that none of the objects will be attained by a policy of withdrawal from Russia. In &quot; Ihe Call,&quot; Mrs. Montefiore compares Trotsky&apos;s &quot; History of the Russian Republic &quot; with a book by M. Antoneili, named &quot; La Russie Bolschevistey The most noteworthy point of the review is the argument that, because &quot; the moral code of any epoch is based on its economic method of production and distribution,&quot; the new Socialist epoch in Russia cannot be judged by the moral code of the previous capitalistic epoch. Such things as the suppression of the liberty of the Press, and other forcible measures for the protection of the Soviet Republic are, in Mrs. Montefiore&apos;s opinion, quite justifiable for the Bolshevists.The International Conferences.^Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; continues his descriptions of his experiences at Lucerne.  He describes the atmosphere of the meeting as hopeful, and points out that apart from Russia and Hungary, Socialist Governments are now in office in Germany, Austria, Georgia, Armenia, Bohemia and Ukrainia.  He draws, however, a distinction, between office and power; though socialist powers may be in office in these countries, he is careful to point out that they are by no means in power Europe is now ruled by military missions.   He gives reports of many conversations with the representatives from these countries, and concludes from them that the Allies are insisting upon the restoration of the old economic order of large estates and slavery and will have nothing to do with socialisation.  This policy, which he describes as political imbecility, he says, is having the result of putting the commerce of these states into the hands of the Americans. Everyone in Lucerne, according to him, regarded Great Britain as the key of the position. He says that we are anything but popular, but it is felt that &quot; the fight some people put up during the war for true democracy &quot; must have expressed a deep seated British spirit. The Germans, he thinks, look to us even more than they do to America, but &quot; if our public opinion does not become more sane and better instructed than it was at the last election, and if this Parliament does not soon cease to exist,&quot; then Mr. Macdonald fears that the outlook will be dark.  In the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; Mr. Macdonald is more definite.  He says that the first problem which the Second International has to face is whether it is to become purely political.  He thinks it ought.  In his opinion the trade unions ought to have their own International, co-operating indeed with the political one and on the most friendly footing with it, but he does not wish the Trade Union Congress to join with the Labour Party in sharing British votes in the Socialist International.  He would rather it devoted, its energy to checking the influence of the General Federation of Trade Unions in the Trade Union International.  A more pressing question in his opinion, is the prospect of a serious division in the international movement.  He does not fear the Third International which he describes as the ephemeral creation of a revolutionary period, but he fears that the divisions in the national movement in Germany and France, and the great multiplication of small nationalities have brought about a condition of affairs under which the number of representatives who represent true socialist organisation is so great that they may command, a majority of votes.  He discusses three phases of this possible division.  The threat to discuss the question of &quot; responsibility &quot; at the forthcoming Geneva Conference next February, he says, originates in a desire not so much for a judicial inquiry as for a political demonstration.  The second phase results from the fact that sections of the socialist parties, under the pressure of nationalism have mixed themselves up in policies that can only bring disgrace and failure upon them.  The third phase he discusses is the subject of Bolshevism-He states that the whole of the Second International is anti-Bolshevist, but maintains that the Bolshevist movement is not a thing that can be condemned by a formula : it must be met by a system.  The Geneva meeting in February he regards as a critical meeting, but he looks forward to this meeting with more confidence in view of the fact that there the Independent Labour Party will be separately represented.  It will thus be seen that Mr. Macdonald is somewhat diffident as regards the immediate prospects of the Second International, that the presence at Lucerne of the representatives of the smaller non-Bolshevist Socialist Republics of Eastern Europe has had a disturbing influence upon him, and that these people have somewhat strengthened his hostility to Russian Bolshevism, which at the time of the Southport Conference of the Labour Party began to be less noticeable.  He is confirmed in his belief that the I.L.P. view of the &quot; Class War &quot; is right.   The idea of a class war, in his opinion, cannot be a constructive political idea ; it is only a descriptive term which requires explanation and needs to be amplified by a definite policy.  The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; contains an article which describes itself as an exposure of the Second International.  The article, however (which is printed.* Cf. Keport, 6th August, pp. 122 and 123 ; Report, 13th August, pp. 133, 143 and 144.  !
103157from &quot; The Class Struggle &quot;) deals with the Berne meeting of the International in February, and is therefore hardly apposite to the Lucerne Conference. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; judges from the press reports of the proceedings of the Lucerne Conference that its proceedings have not been very harmonious or very useful. He -describes the quarrels and jealousies between the two German parties as pitiable and P regrettable. He thinks it is only useful to debate the failure of the International either to stop the outbreak of the war or to influence the peace settlement in so far as a discussion will help to make the reasons for the failure plain and to assist to strengthen the weak places which have been discovered in the constitution of the International. He hopes that by February next, when the full conference under the revised constitution is to meet, all the sections comprising the International will have realised the importance of socialist unity in the face of the dangers with which it is threatened by &quot;International Capitalism.&quot; The &quot; Democrat &quot; contains a letter from Mr. Appleton, the newly-elected President of the International Federation of Trade Unions. He appeals for a more expeditious method of procedure to be followed at the conferences of this body, and affirms that it must be the business of the Trade Union International to assist in the suppression of the old suspicions and animosities between nations.India, &apos; .Mr. H. M. Hyndman contributes an article to &quot; Justice &quot; on British rule in India. He maintains that &quot; not even the crimes of which Prussianized Germany has been guilty, transcend in infamy the cold economic and social rain which the people of Great Britain deliberately inflict upon the inhabitants of the vast Empire of Hindustan.&quot; He describes British rule as a &quot; carpet-bagger tyranny,&quot; and asserts that we drain from India each year  30,000,000 without any commercial return. He quotes Sir Louis Malet as saying in 1879, &quot; Our only hope now of justice to India is a revolution in England.&quot; He describes thelndian Mutiny as a national Indian rising, and compares Indian services to us during the war with the methods by which, it is alleged, Punjab riots have been suppressed. &quot; Our; own atrocities stand on a level with the outrages committed by Germany in Belgium, France and Poland.&quot; He considers that the Government of India Bill, now before Parliament, is a &quot; contemptible measure &quot; and quite useless to India. He concludes by appealing to all those who are striving for freedom in Europe (&quot; tyranny there,&quot; he says, &quot; strengthens militarism here&quot;) to take an active part in the straggle for the speedy emancipation of India.Other.The &quot; Nation &quot; deals in a special article with the hardships of German Austria, and also quotes-from the United States Senate&apos;s inquiry upon the Peace Treaty, the American draft of Section 10 of the Treaty. The draft of this article and the article in its final form are compared, and the opinion is expressed that President Wilson wished to make the &quot; self-determination of the people concerned &quot; and &quot; the majority opinion of the League,&quot;, the &quot; decisive principles as to territory,&quot; but has to accept &quot; an unqualified legitimist view of the sanctity of the status quo.&quot; It may be noted, however, that in making this comparison the &quot; Nation&quot; gives in fact a garbled version of Section 10, and gives only extracts from the American draft. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; continues its account of the Winnipeg strike and deals this week mainly with the exploits of the special police. In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; Messrs. J. T. Walton Newbold and G. H. Martin, join in writing an article dealing mainly with oil deposits in the Near East. It is suggested that the &quot;&quot; whole cackle about small nationalities is a device to secure the establishment of small states under the League of Nations and by military means, that exist only to countersign the decrees of international exploiters.&quot; &quot; The Balkans have been cleared of the Ottoman Empire to make room for the Oil Trust.&quot; This remark is as obscure as a reference to the &quot; small state of Azerbaijan in the Caucasus.&quot; The &quot; British Citizen &quot;contains an article describing a State land settlement in California. &quot; Justice &quot; compliments the new Czecho-Slovakian Premier, who is said to be an avowed Social-Democrat, on a declaration of his, which is as follows : &quot; Before the war, Socialism was no more than a critical force, but it contained the germ of mighty powers of creation as well; our task to-day is to set free these j creative powers and to build up an organisation which, while answering to the ideal of a proletarian world, should also ensure the maintenance of the unbroken flow of production during the transition time.&quot;
(B) Home Affairs.The Profiteering Act.There is much discussion of this measure in these papers, the value of which, however,, is reduced by the fact that the latest event of which the articles take cognisance is the Second Reading of the Bill in the House of Commons.  Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses the opinion that the most plausible explanation of the introduction of: the Profiteering Bill is that &quot; certain powerful trade interests have become alarmed at the prospect of disclosures, and have brought pressure to bear upon the Government to stop the investigations of the Select Committee.&quot;  But Mr. Snowden does not think that the Profiteering Act is an adequate reason for the Select Committee to suspend its activities-Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; adopts a similar explanation of the Govern-departments action.  He has no faith in the efficacy of the proposed system of tribunals, and complains that they afford no means of bringing back to the people &quot; the money which has been stolen from them.&quot;  The policy he recommends is that the Government should, take over control of all supplies and should prohibit the manufacture of articles and means of luxury.  The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; thinks that the introduction of the Profiteering Bill has been a &quot; dodge &quot; to win popularity for the Government in the Pontefract by-election, and complains that the tribunals.may punish some of the small men, but will let the big &quot; profiteers &quot; go free.  The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; is astonished that only eight members voted against the Second Reading of the Bill in the House of Commons.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; and the &quot; Worker &quot; regard the provisions of clause 3 -(&apos;- Power to authorize local authorities to trade &quot;) as the most promising in the Bill, but concludes. &quot; profiteering and high prices will prevail until the Government stops its ruinous extrava-gance, lives within its income and removes every existing embargo on trade.&quot;  The Wool-wich &quot; Pioneer &quot; thinks it would have been better to put the administration of the Act into the hands of the Ministry of Food.  The &quot; Call&quot; suggests that profiteering is the foundation of capitalist society, and does not expect anything serious to result from the Act.  The &quot; Nation &quot; deals with the question in an article and maintains that the embargoes on imports make profiteering possible.  It complains of the drafting of the measure, and suggests that to-set local committees to administer an act of such &quot; vague wording &quot; is to ensure the maximum of injustice and incompetency, and expresses the opinion that the suspicion that the purpose of the measure is to direct attention from the &quot; big profiteer &quot;&apos; (including the Government) to the little one, is amply justified.  The &quot; New Statesman &quot; dismisses the Governments proposals as &quot;the flimsiest of expedients,&quot; but admits the difficulty of making really practical suggestions as to what can be done immediately to remedy the evil of profiteering by manufacturers and wholesale merchants.  This journal is, however, confident that the proposals it developed at great length last week, if adopted,, would to a large extent solve the problem.*  The &quot; New Statesman &quot; shows some suspicion of the intentions of the Board of Trade.  The &quot;; New Age&quot; believes that the evidence of the Food Controller was reallv more distructive of the Select Committee than that of the President of the Board of Trade, and deduces from his evidence the conclusion that the policy of the Profiteering Act is sure to fail, and again repeats its hint that the solution of the problem of high prices may be found in an examination of the credit system.  Thougk the &quot; New Age &quot; protests against the &quot; tabu which has been laid on the discussion of the subject of money,&quot; it nevertheless observes the prohibition.  The &quot; Democrat &quot; professes little confidence in the wisdom of the tribunal method of dealing with profiteering, and doubts whether any policy will succeed in reducing prices while the &quot; exchange rates are against Britain.&quot;  It calls, therefore, for more export of manufactured goods, and a removal of the restraints upon the importation of raw materials.  In the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; Mr. Joe Terrett condemns State interference in the distribution of food supplies as being&apos;wasteful and unprogressive.   &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; expresses a desire for a comprehensive Government report on the causes of high prices.Public Expenditure.The third report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure has inspired many articles. &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Clarion,&quot; however, maintain that the conclusion which is being based upon the reports of this Committee, that the State is unable to do what socialists expect of it, is not tenable. The &quot; Nation &quot; devotes much attention to the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 7th August, and calls upon him to force an assertion of Treasury authority or to resign. &quot; He might in such an action change the course of history.&quot;   In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; Sir Leo Chiozza Money asserts that what is wrong* Cf. Report, 13th August, p. 138.
with our national expenditure is not its size but its character. He would have less money spent on the Navy and Army, and more on Education and other &quot; social services.&quot; He would reduce the interest and sinking fund charges of the National Debt, not only by&quot; means of a general capital levy, but also by a special levy to obtain restitution of the fortunes made out of the war. A decrease in private extravagance he thinks, is quite as essential as a decrease in public extravagance, and this, he suggests, can only be achieved by the elimination of industrial capital. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the same paper, maintains that the &quot;present and preceding War Governments&quot; are wholly responsible for the state of affairs. In order to avoid national bankruptcy, he lays down three things as necessary. There must be a ruthless reduction of national expenditure. There must be an increase in production, and in our exports of manufactured goods. Finally there must be a drastic reform in our system of taxation, and the adoption of a capital levy. Mr. Snowden has no hope that the present Government will adopt such a policy and therefore he calls for a change in Government. He complains that a decade ago no Government could have sur-vlved for a single day which had proved itself &quot; guilty of the extravagance and incompe-tence of which this Government has been admitted guilty.&quot; The opinions of the &quot;Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; and Colonel Wedgwood (in &quot; Forward&quot;) are substantially the same as those of Mr. Snowden.Bolshevist Propaganda.- The &quot;British Citizen&quot; refers to the &quot; revelations regarding Bolshevist activities&quot; and states that this &quot; sudden awakening to the fact that there is an organised conspiracy going on in England to utilise Labour for the purpose of overturning Constitutional Govern-ment &quot; has aroused &quot; bitter resentment among the majority of the workers.&quot; This opinion, however, does not seem to be shared by any other of these papers. The judgment of &quot; The Call &quot; is as follows : &quot; The purpose of all this rubbish is evident; our rulers hope in this way to damp down unrest by frightening the workman from expressing his dis-content for fear he should be regarded as a Bolshevik.&quot; This paper asserts that the British Sociaist party would welcome aid from the Bolshevists, but that it is prevented from receiving any by the blockade and the passport system. Miss Sylvia Pankhurst explains in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; how she received  280 from Zachariassen. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; refers to the &quot; infinitely mean trickery taking place at Scotland Yard,&quot; . and to &quot; entirely false stories of Bolshevist money and agents.&quot; The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; suggests that the reports have been circulated in order &quot; to strengthen the case for the continuance of the Defence of the Realm Act regulations.&quot; &quot; Justice &quot; maintains that it would have been better &quot; to remain silent altogether until the time came to make a clean and clear exposure of the whole business.&quot; The opinion of this paper is that it is not the contents of the pamphlets but the sources of financial supplies and the means of conveying these that demand attention. The &quot;New Age&quot; thinks that an expenditure, of  6,000 in subverting the system of Government in this country would be wanton extrava-gance ; &quot;the existing system has already been subverted.&quot;The Industrial Outlook,. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; declares in a leading article that the situation in the Labour world.is serious. The seriousness is, however, attributed not so much to the external foes of Trade Unionism as to want of policy, divided counsels and lack of discipline within the movement. It is stated that a number of recent strikes have served no other purpose than needlessly to irritate the public and bring disaster upon those who have participated, in them. Labour is warned that the strike weapon must not be used indiscriminately or sporadically, and an appeal is made for common and united action. Miss Sylvia Pank-hurst, in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; asserts that the Government has challenged the Triple Alliance to a struggle and asks whether Labour is afraid to do its duty. &quot;Justice &quot; concludes that the &quot; last strike outburst&quot; is abating, and expresses the opinion that the two strikes which were &quot; authorised &quot; have been about as useless as they well could be. This journal asks the leaders and members of the Triple Alliance to consider well what the results of a Triple Alliance strike may be. Its own judgment is that &quot; &apos; direction action&apos; may be very telling as&apos; bluff &apos;; it is quite unsound as a policy.&quot; The &quot;. British Citizen &quot; thinks the outlook is much more hopeful. &quot; There are signs that the mass of Labour has determined to resume its control of the Trade Union machine, and to place it once more in the hands of their tried leaders.&quot; Mr. David Gilmour pursues in this paper the theory that the discontent that is felt by many workers with the whole economic system under which(C 1868) - Z
they live, is largely the deliberate creation of the extremist type of trade union leaders, who have put forward what they know to be impossible demands in order to gain popu-clarity. The &quot; Nation &quot; discusses the causes of the &quot; collapse of the movement for direct action.&quot; It attributes this collapse to the action of the Government &quot; in going half-way to meet the campaign,&quot; and to the &quot; bold stand taken by those trade union leaders who still believe that Parliament can.be made a real instrument of democratic Government.&quot; The Merthyr &quot;Pioneer&quot; reports a speech at Merthyr by David Kirkwood in which he described the efficacy of the &quot; mass picket &quot; in conducting strikes. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; attributes what it regards as the failure of the bakers&apos; strike to the weakness of the Union in London, and to the hostility of the&apos;public. For this latter factor in&apos;the failure of the strike it blames the action of the Union in calling out the men employed in the co-operative bakeries. The Woolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; also complains of this action against the co-operative societies. &quot; Eob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; discusses the police strike and hopes that its failure may result in the expulsion of certain &quot;noxious vapours&quot; from the Socialist-Labour atmosphere. He asserts that to describe the Police Act as &quot; a blow at Trade Unionism is a mere abuse of language.&quot; He does not know whether this Act provides the best substitute for full Trade Unionism that may be permitted to the police, but he insists that everything will depend on the way the Act is administered, which in its turn will depend on the kind of Parliament the working class with the other electors send to West-minster. He concludes his article by quoting with approval the condemnation of the &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; and its policy of encouraging &quot; direct action&quot; which appeared in the &quot; New Age &quot; last week and refers to its &quot; slim arguments, misleading analogies, special pleading, sentimental arithmetic and false assumptions.&quot; It may be noted that &quot; Rob Roy &quot; uses the Samson metaphor which &quot; Justice &quot; discovered on the 26th July, and which the &quot; Clarion.&quot; borrowed last week.*The Political Outlook.The Woolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; warns its readers that the present Government is damned, though it might not yet be dead. It is concerned that the voters should be ready &quot; to steel their hearts and minds against the claptrap flapdoodle with which they will be deluged when at last the Coalition expires.&quot; It does not wish them to be &quot; caught napping again.&quot; &quot; Forward &quot; warns Labour organisers everywhere to perfect their electoral machinery with the utmost dispatch.Other.The discussion on &quot; Parliamentarism and Trade Unionism &quot; which began in the &quot; Call &quot; on the 5th June, is continued this week by Mr. W. McLaine and Mr. J. Carney (who is described as the editor of the Duluth, U.S.A., &quot; Truth.&quot;)! Both these writers describe Trade Union leaders as &quot; office-seekers,&quot; and insist upon the need for unofficial &quot; workers&apos; committees.&quot; Mr. McLaine thinks that Parliament has finished its work and that its period of usefulness is over. He does not, however, think that political action should therefore be abandoned, but he wishes that its strict limitations should be recognised. Mr. Carney states that articles from &quot; The Call&quot; are a &quot; leading attraction of &apos; Truth&apos; and many other radical papers in U.S.A.&quot; In the &quot; Socialist &quot; (the organ of the Socialist Labour Party), Mr. W. Paul puts the case for the Labour College. In this paper also, the recent report prepared by the Federation of British Industries on Labour unrest and kindred matters is dealt with. The measures of reform advocated in the report are de-scribed as &quot; safety-valves calculated to relieve the pressure on capitalism,&quot; and the &quot; social-list &quot; regards the whole report as a proof of the wisdom of its hostility to &quot; reformism.&quot; The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is disturbed at the rumours which are circulating as to financial developments in the direction of forming big spinning combines, and fears that such an occurrence may have a detrimental effect on the operatives concerned. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; regards the report recently presented to the Building Trades Joint Industrial Council by the Committee this council set up to consider scientific management and reduction of costs,J as far outweighing in importance the work of all the other Whitley Councils put together. The centenary of the so-called Peterloo Massacre on the 16th August, 1819, is the occasion of articles in many papers. The temptation to draw an analogy between the events which followed the war which ended in the Congress of Vienna, and those which may follow the war which is ending in the Paris Conference, has proved so strong that many papers have succumbed. But the analogy has not, proved conducive either&apos;to good history or to good prophecy.* Cf. Report, 13th August, p. 137. f Cf., ibid, p. 136. J Cf. this Report, p. 162.
Part TV.-General Topics and District Reports.(1) General Topics. 1 national Industrial Conference.The Minister introduced the Forty-Eight Hours Bill and the Minimum Wages Bill, in which the recommendations of the Conference are embodied, on the 18th inst.The Trade Union side of the Conference has taken preliminary steps in connection with the setting up of the National Industrial Council.Railway Employees.The unrest among all classes of railway employees, which was referred to in last week&apos;s Report, has assumed serious proportions. On the 13th inst. a conference took place at the Board of Trade, with Sir Robert Home as chairman, between officials of the Board of Trade, members of the Railway Executive Committee, and representatives of the Railway Unions. At this conference no definite conclusions were arrived at, but it was decided to arrange a further conference at an early date. On the following day the Executive of the A.S.L.E. and F. considered the situation resulting from this conference, and authorised a letter to be sent to the President of the Board of Trade requesting an interview on the next day. This letter stated that the Executive feared that, if further-progress could not be reported to the disaffected districts, it would be unable any longer to restrain its members. In reply to this letter the President of the Board of Trade wrote to the Executive of the A.S.L.E. and F. stating that the offer of the Government would be&apos; communicated to them on the 18th inst. This letter the Executive regarded as evidence of further progress, and decided to await the revised Government offer. This offer was duly made on the 18th, and shows an appreciable advance on the original proposals of the Railway Executive Committee. - It was considered at a joint conference of the Executives of the N.U.R. and A.S.L.E. and F. on the 18th inst., and it was decided to request an interview with the President of the Board of Trade with regaid to it. This interview took place on the 20th inst., and a settlement was reached. During the week-end several local branches, and also the Liverpool and the South Wales and Monmouth-shire District Councils, of the A.S.L.E. and F. passed resolutions in favour of drastic action. &apos;The Railway Clerks&apos; Association held a special delegate conference, attended by 512 representatives, at Birmingham on the 17th inst. A resolution was passed expressing keen disappointment and dissatisfaction with the slow progress made in the negotiations. The latest offers of the Government were declared to be quite inadequate.  The conference.     (C1868) Z2,;  &apos; - (2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement,Training in Handicrafts.A writer in &quot; Justice &quot; expresses the opinion that the training of disabled soldiers in handicrafts will indirectly help to sustain the present, industrial system, since these ex-soldiers will be added to the body of labour engaged in purely luxury trades which need the patronage of the rich to maintain them. He objects, therefore, to this revival of handi-craft, maintaining that at this time it is more than ever,important that everything should be utilitarian, so that the wealth destroyed by the war may be re-created.Ex-Soldiers and Unemployment.The proposed reduction of the Rhine Army is viewed with alarm by the &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; (14th inst.), from the fact that it will mean an addition to the already crowded ranks of the unemployed ex-Service men. The paper reviews the merits of the army&apos;s original demobilisation scheme, and concludes that it would have served its better in the long run to have adhered to it.* The &quot;Daily Chronicle &quot; (15th inst.), describes.the diffi-culties encountered by ex-officers in finding work, which it learnt from an official of the ex-Officers&apos; Union. The &quot;Liverpool Post and Mercury &quot; of the 18th inst., on the same subject, quotes the experience of the Nottingham appointments department; In some cases trade unions blocked the way of men who wished to take jobs where training was provided ; in others, employers preferred to retain the cheaper labour of girls.
pledged the members of the Association to support the Executive Committee in whatever steps they might consider should be taken, including if necessary the withholding of their labour, in order to secure a satisfactory settlement. Negotiations between the negotiating committee of the RCA. and the Railway Executive Committee took place on the 18th, 19th and 20th inst. An amended offer has been made by the Railway Executive Committee, and this has been submitted by the negotiating committee to the full Executive of the R.C.A.The Railway Shopworkers&apos; Conference, which took place on the 16th and 17th inst., has put forward a new national programme.The Building Industry.At the first annual meeting of the Joint Industrial Council lor this industry, held on the 14th and 15th inst., certain proposals of the greatest importance for the future of the industry were made. The Building Resettlement Committee presented an interim report on the supply of labour for the Government housing schemes. The Committee had been informed that 220,000 men were required to carry through the Governments housing programme in its first year. The Committee thought this estimate was a full one. They concluded that if every man trained in the industry (including those still in the Army) were made available, there would still be a shortage of 100,000 men. To meet this deficit, the Committee thought that the last method that should be considered was the method of dilution. Before any measure of dilution was considered, they thought every effort should be made to utilise and make more productive existing labour. They emphasised three aspects of this problem : (1) They believed the first step was to secure a better distribution of labour, and recommended that schemes be drawn up for the purpose. (2) They expressed the opinion that the almost exclusive use of one medium, i.e., bricks, for schemes in every part of the country might prevent the most productive use being made of some sources of labour, e.g., stonemasons. (3) They thought the re-vival of enforced priority would be unpopular ; but if other means failed to give due weight to the importance of housing schemes over certain other types of private enterprise, they recommended that the priority scheme selected should be drawn up in consultation with the trade.  After some discussion this report was adopted.The report of the Committee on Scientific Management and Reduction of Costs was then considered. The committee reported that there were four main factors tending to the restriction of output, viz.: (a) Pear of Unemployment, (b) Disinclination of opera-tives to make unrestricted profits for private employers, (c) Operatives&apos; lack of interest in the industry, owing to non-participation in control, (d) Inefficiency, both managerial and operative. To remove the. first of these causes, they recommended : (1) The setting up of Regional Councils whose duty it would be, in co-operation with the Government and local authorities; to regularise the demand for building so as to avoid alternating periods of congestion and stagnation. (2) Consultation with other industries, with a view to the investigation of the possibility of a regular seasonal interchange of labour (e.g., in wet or bad seasons the employing of unemployed building labour on afforestation, roadmaking, estate clearing and insanitary area demolition schemes. (3) The establishment of an unemployment fund formed by contributions from firms in proportion to their wages bills. In an attempt to discover a remedy for the second cause, they found that the operatives were not favourable to profit-sharing schemes. Therefore they were led to consider the re-organisation of the industry as a quasi-public service, and they recommended the recognition of three principles, viz: (a) Regular and sufficient rates of pay to operatives. (6) Salaries to owner-managers commensurate with their abilities, (c) A regular and limited rate of interest on the capital employed. Other recommenda-tions were made with regard to the utilisation of surplus earnings, improvement in organisation and methods of comparative costing. It should be noted that all the operatives on the Committee signed the report, but five of the eight employers, while agreeing with some of the proposals, did not see their way to sign it without important reservations. Two of these employers voiced some of their objections at the meeting, and eventually it was agreed to ask the Committee to examine further the possible effect of the principles embodied in the report.Other business of less importance was transacted, and office bearers for the ensuing year were appointed.Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades.The ballot of members of the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trade Unions on the question of a 44-hour week without reduction in wages resulted in 520,655 votes in favour
and 16,307 against. The recent Employes&apos; Conference has suggested that the question of the introduction of the 44-hour week should be referred, as was metionend in last week&apos;s Report, to a joint committee of employers and employes, with an independent chairman.Mining.The Conference of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers met at Ayr on the 13th inst., and concluded on the 16th inst. On the opening day Mr. Smillie delivered a long address, in which he emphasised the miners&apos; demand for the nationalisation of the mines. Mr. Duncan Green, M.P., moved a resolution in favour of the nationalisation of the mines, which was adopted. A resolution was carried requesting the Miners&apos; Federa-tion to demand the withdrawal of British troops from Russia, and Mr. James Donaldson expressed regret that the Triple Alliance had decided to postpone further action on this issue. Resolutions were also Carried protesting against the authorities favouring wooden huts for housing purposes, and asking the Miners&apos; Federation to take action to secure a more adequate pension scheme for soldiers, sailors and their dependents. The Chairman called attention to the statement in the press that the Ministry of Labour were considering a suggestion for the introduction of legislative measures to make strikes and lock-outs illegal without a week&apos;s notice being given in writing. A resolution of protest was carried. A motion that the hours of surface workers should be the same as those of the men working below was defeated. On the question of overtime rates, a proposal from Lanarkshire was adopted that where overtime cannot be avoided, payment shall be at the rate of time-and-a-half ; all Sunday labour to be paid at double-time rates. A resolution was adopted in favour of the policy of a five-day week for all Scottish miners.National Federation of General Workers. . .The annual General Council meeting of this Federation commenced at Manchester on the 14th inst. Mr. Clynes made an important presidential address, in which he expressed his opposition to direct action, and with reference to the rumour that legislation was con-templated to make strikes illegal without one week&apos;s notice, warned the Minister of Labour that legislation designed to force any disability upon trade unions would be resisted to the uttermost. Mr. March (Vehicle Workers, London), moved a resolution as follows:  &quot; Seeing that the International Labour Charter has become an integral part of the League of Nations and as it would appear that only those unions which cater for special industries are to have any status as regards advising the League of Nations on matters affecting Labour, this meeting representing about one million general workers demands representa-tion in connection therewith.&quot; Mr. Clynes and Mr. Ben Tillett supported the resolution. Mr. Clynes expressed confidence in the labour provisions of the Peace Treaty. A resolution was adopted in favour of a joint conference to discuss the relationship between the craft unions and the bodies of general workers, with a view to reaching an understanding with regard to the operation of the Pre-war Practices Bill. A resolution was adopted in favour of more liberal old-age pensions, and a motion was passed instructing the Executive to take steps with a view to establishing an International Federation of General Workers of all countries. The following resolution with reference to the employment of married women in industry was passed: &quot; Believing that the employment of married women in industry is a factor for keeping down wages, and relieves the State of its obligation to make proper provision for disabled men, this Council instructs its Executive to take steps with a view to stopping the same.&quot; The Council resolved to do all in its power to secure the abolition of conscription.Police.In spite of the campaign in favour of the Police Union, which the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; continues to conduct, the sympathetic movement is apparently dying down. Local branches of Trade Unions continue to pass resolutions of support, and meetings organised by the Police Union in London and the provinces have been officially attended by Trade Union representatives, but Labour as a whole has definitely declined either to strike in sympathy with, or to give substantial financial assistance to, the Police Union. This attitude was emphasised by the executive of the N.U.R., which decided that it could not take the responsibility of sanctioning a stoppage in sympathy, with the Police Union, as it was not consulted with regard to the merits of the dispute. And the threatened three-day sympathetic strike in Liverpool has been promptly repudiated, both by the Dockers&apos; Union and by a special meeting of representatives of 28 unions affiliated to the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation.
Amalgamation. &apos; . ,Balloting is now taking place oh the scheme for the amalgamation of the Trades Unions connected with&apos;the engineering and cognate trades. This scheme was agreed to by the Conference of Executive representatives held at York on the 29th and 30th May, 1919, representing the following societies: Amalgamated Society ol Engineers; United Machine Workers&apos; Association; United Patternmakers&apos; Association; United Kingdom Society of Amalgamated Smiths and Strikers; Amalgamated Society of General Tool-makers, Engineers and Mechanics; Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society; Electrical Trades Union ; The Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen; North of England Brassmoulders&apos; Trade and Benefit Society; East of Scotland Brassfonnders&apos; Society; The. National. Society of Brassworkers and Metal Mechanics; Associated Brassfounders&apos;, Turners&apos;, Eitters&apos;, Finishers&apos;, and Coppersmiths&apos; Society; Amalgamated Instrument Makers&apos; Society; Amalgamated Society of Scale, Beam and Weighing Machine Makers-; North of England Brass-Turners&apos;, Fitters&apos;, and Finishers&apos; Society; Dublin Brassfounders&apos; and Finishers&apos; Society; London United Brassfounders&apos; Society. The scheme is drafted in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Conference of representatives of the organisations, held at York on the 11th and 12th September, 1918. The Committee, which was then appointed, has recommended that a complete pooling of funds of the unions amalgamating be the principle upon which such amalgamation shall take place, and that consequently the amalgamating unions, on the amalgamation being registered, will cease to exist as separate bodies. The total membership and funds of the organisations represented at the second York Conference were stated to be : Combined membership, 468,339; combined total funds,  3,343,240. The Committee took into consideration the question of organising a society upon industrial lines, and eliminating friendly benefits, but for various reasons they had no hesitation in deciding against the adoption of a scheme of amalgamation on industrial lines only. The Committee recommends that the Executive Council, which shall be the governing body, shall, in the first place, be composed of the Executive of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers  seven members-and one member of each of the amalgamating unions with a minimum membership of 10,000. The title of the new organisation is the &quot; Amalgamated Engineering Union.&apos;;It is reported that the representative Council of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen&apos;s Association has decided not to take a ballot on the present proposals for amalgamation.At a conference of the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses on the 7th inst., it was resolved to instruct the Executive Council to do eveiything possible to bring about an amalgamation with the Scottish Operative Tailors and Tailoresses and the United Garment Workers.A joint meeting of the A.U.C.E., the National Warehouse.Workers and the National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks has been held.at which the three secretaries were appointed as a committee to draft proposals for the amalgamation of the unions to be considered at a meeting to be held on the 31st August.The ballot of the Fawcett Association on the question of amalgamation with the Postmen&apos;s Federation and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association shows 4,467 votes in favour of the amalgamation and 383 against.   *Trade Union Topics.It is reported that the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union have been accepted as members of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, and that further applications for admission from other unions have been accepted with one exception,At a meeting of the Aldborough (East Riding) Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union on the 11th inst., a resolution was carried pledging the members not to work with Irishmen unless they could prove their loyalty, and were willing to contribute Is. per week to the Union.Income Tax.-At a meeting of the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation on the 11th inst., it was resolved that the miners be instructed to fill in Income Tax leturns at present asked for by the authorities, and that the whole matter be further considered at the next meeting of the Council. The London Law Clerks&apos; Union has adopted a resolution demanding that clerical workers should have the advantage now enjoyed by manual workers of having their cost of travelling to and from places of work deducted from the Inoome Tax Assessment.
Disabled Men.The Oldham Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association has issued a circular with reference to the employment of 300 more or less disabled ex-soldiers who wrere formerly spinning mill operatives in Oldham. It is suggested that each mill should employ some of these men in proportion to the number of its spindles. The men are to be paid a minimum wage of  3 per week from a central fund, to which the firms will contribute in proportion to the number of their spindles.National Socialist Party.The second annual conference of the National Socialist Party was opened at North-ampton on the 16th inst., Mr. W. Thorne, M.P.,&apos;acting as provisional chairman. Mr. Thorne, in his address to the conference, condemned the Government for its policy of drift at a time when it was. possible to establish a social distribution of wealth through public ownership of the means of life. The Government was directly responsible for the futile and dangerous attempts to find remedies for political and social perils by unconsti-tutional means. He expressed his opposition to direct action. The report of the Executive Committee included a memorandum on the League of Nations which stated that the democratic nations must form its basis if it were to secure the purpose for which it was called into existence. The proposed treaties between France, the United Kingdom and the Umted States were welcomed as a decided step towards an alliance which wrould be the most promising beginning of a real League. In the discussion which followed, Mr. Brownlie (Chairman of the A.S.E.) expressed the view that the unwise use of the strike weapon at the present time would split up the trade union movement. Neither the miners nor transport workers had any right to hold up the country, in order to wring concessions, any more than had the Capitalists. Mr. Hyndman moved a resolution heartily supporting the recommendations of the Coal Commission in favour of the nationalisation and socialisation of the coal mines, and warning the coal owners and capitalists that their anti-patriotic agitation against the resumption by the people of their own national property might justly deprive the exploiting minority of any compensation whatsoever. This resolution was adopted with one dissentient. The Executive asked the conference to declare that the National Socialist Party is opposed to all dictatorship, whether organised by a Church, a King or Empire, an aristocracy, oligarchy, plutocracy,Ex-8ervice Men.The Bradford, branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. have applied for affiliation with the Bradford and District Trades and Labour Council. The Neath branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. has decided to ask all members of the executive and officials who hold extreme Labour and Socialist views to resign. The Secretary of the Anglesey branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. has addressed a letter to the President of the Board of Education protesting against the appoint-ment of a young woman as organising instructor of physical education. It is reported that during the past month the National Union of Ex-Service Men has largely increased its membership, branches of the N.F.D.D.S.S. having joined in a body. This Union claims that it will investigate every case where a discharged man is refused justice from a Trade Union, but on the other hand it is determined that no employer will be permitted to exploit discharged soldiers in order to lower the wages of Trade Unionists.Manchester and Glasgow ex-Service men are continuing to make their grievances known. It is stated that the Manchester men will carry out their intention to march to London to see the Minister of Labour at the end of this month. It is estimated that about 3,000 men will take part, a large number of whom are partially disabled. Army ovens are to be procured and arrangements are to be made by advance agents for rations to be served in- the various towns through which the demonstrators will pass. The affair is being organised by the National Association of Unemployed Ex-Service Men. One of the demands to be made will be that in all Government Departments women shall be replaced by ex-Service men. A deputation of ex-Service men belonging to the N.F.D.D.S.S.,. sent by the District Council of the Scottish Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, protested to the Lord Provost and members of the Corporation of Glasgow against the reduction of the out-of-work donation to ex-Service men after a period of 26 weeks. The suggestion was also made that the men should be paid in batches every day of the week instead of on the present method.
or by usurpers such as Lenin and Trotsky, who, with all their closest associates, do not belong to the working classes, though they pretend to have established a dictatorship of the proletariat.Irish Transport and General &quot;Workers&apos; Union.The Annual Report of this Union shows an increase in membership between the months of June and December, 1918, of from 43,788 to 68,827. This Union is rapidly becoming the &quot; One Big Union&quot; in Ireland. It has become very popular owing to its success in forcing up wages, and it has recently been doing its best to foment unrest among agricultural labourers. At the moment there are strikes in Kildare, Meath, Galway and parts of Wicklow on the wage question, and the strikers have been not only picketing country fairs, but also Dublin docks and railway stations, in order to prevent farmers from disposing of their stock. Mr. William 0&apos;Brien, of this Union, has been elected President of the Socialist Party in Ireland. The increase in the membership of the Union is most noticeable in districts where Sinn Fein is strongest, and in Ulster the Union remains comparatively weak. There are branches in Cavan, but none in Antrim, and few in any of the other Ulster counties. The Union is essentially Irish, but it is said to be attempting, by encouraging Irishmen in England and Scotland to join British Trade Unions, to inspire them with &quot; a more militant spirit.&quot;The Five-Day Week.As a result of the general reduction of working hours in many industries to 47 or 48, various Trade Journals are discussing the practicability of the entire abolition of Saturday as a working day. Many employers apparently think it not worth while to get up steam, etc., for the sake of three or four hours&apos; work, and find, in any case, that the Saturday morning output is unsatisfactory ; and the employees would value the long week-end that the abolition of Saturday labour would give them. An actual instance of the operation of the five-day week is provided by Messrs. Hatton-, Shaw &amp; Co., of Irthlingborough, a firm in the Full Chrome Leather trade, which has introduced a 9^-hour working day on five days a week. For four months the system has been in operation, and both the firm and the employees are stated to be unanimously in favour of its continuance. It is reported that other leather manufacturers in the Northampton district are instituting a similar five-day week.The National Union of Scottish Mine Workers has decided to endorse the policy of a five-day week for miners.Unemployment Donation Statistics.The table showing the total number of unemployment donation policies remaining lodged for the United Kingdom on the 1st August reveals for the first time since the 2nd of May an increase over the previous week. From the 2nd of May, when the total number of policies lodged was 1,093,400, the numbers decreased rapidly to 606,125 on the 27th June, and then slowly to 540,884 on the 25th July. On the 1st August, however, the number had increased to 553,482. This increase is mainly accounted for by an addition to the unemployment donation register during the week of 4,525 workers engaged in Iron, Steel and other Metal Production, and 11,022 Textile (Woollen and Worsted) Operatives.Court of Arbitration.During the week ended the 16th August, 1919, the Court of Arbitration heard 13. cases in London.  The principal case concerned is the Building Trade.-Joint Industrial Councils.The following table shows the progress that has been made in the establishment

Furniture; Gas; Gold, Silver, &amp;c.; Heavy Chemicals; Hosiery (Scottish); Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers); Matches; Paint, Colour and Varnish ; Road Transport; ftubber ; Sawmilling; Waterworks Undertakings ;. Wool (and Allied) Textiles; Woollen and Worsted (Scottish). Most of the other Councils have the question of the formation of District Councils under consideration. In some industries District Councils are regarded as unnecessary.Works Committees have been or are being set up under the auspices of the respective Joint Industrial Councils for the following Industries:-Bobbins; China; Clay; Coir(C 1868) 2 A
Mat and Matting; Hosiery (Scottish); Matches; Pottery; Rubber; Tin Mining; Woollen and Worsted (Scottish). Several other Councils are at present considering the question of the formation of Works Committees.Trade Boards.Lace Finishing Trade Board. This Board having obtained the consent of the Minister of Labour thereto, have issued a proposal to vary the general minimum piece-rates for Warp Lace and Hair Nets so as to correspond with the existing general minimum time-rates.Corset Trade Board. This Board.have issued a proposal to fix : (i) General minimum time-rates of 8%d. an hour for female workers other than learners and Is. lid. an hour for male workers of 22 years of. age and over, with lower rates for male workers under that age and for female learners, (ii) Piece-work basis time-rates of 9\d. an hour for female workers and Is. f6\d. an hour for all male workers, (iii) Overtime rates for male and female workers, and to declare that, for the purpose of such overtime rates, the normal number of hours of work per week shall be.48.Draft Special Orders. Statutory notice has been given of the Ministers intention to bring within the scope of the Trade Boards Acts the following trades: (i) The Stamped or Pressed Metal-Wares trade, (ii) The Button-making trade, (iii) The Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener trade, (iv) The Coffin Furniture and Cerement-making trade, (v) The Perambulator and Invalid Carriage trade,  (vi.) The Toy trade.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The latest returns show a decline of over 2,600 in the live register. A further increase in juvenile unemployment took place in consequence of the numbers leaving school.Resettlement. There is little fresh to report. The Southwark Council are considering a scheme for the expenditure of  107,000; they are already employing 300 ex-Service men in addition to 20.0 of their former, employees (returned from the Forces. The Walmer Urban District Council have obtained sanction for a sewage scheme in which 480 men are to be employed. The Dartford Employment Committee urge that immediate sanction should be given to the matter of two building schemes, which covers the provision of 25 houses, as delay must occur before the larger scheme can be carried out.General. Nothing of a serious nature is observable in the industrial situation. In the home counties harvesters and farm labourers, in spite of increases, are now. demanding pay based on the acreage of corn garnered.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemjployment-k small increase is reported, due chiefly to the effect on employment in Leicester of the dyers&apos; and trimmers&apos; strike, which has now been settled, and of the termination of army contracts for boots and shoes.Resettlement. Inadequate transport facilities and the problem of housing continue to retard resettlement. To these factors may be added the high cost of raw materials, which is affecting the Northampton boot and shoe trade.South-Western.Unemployment-k further small decrease in unemployment is reported.Resettlement. Owing to the lack of shipping facilities, the discharge of some 300 men from the Cornish china-clay pits is expected. At Bideford, the closing of H.M. Factory, producing by-products by wood distillation, has had a detrimental effect, and there is a strong opinion locally that work should be resumed.Difficulties in replacing with their former employers apprentices returning from the Forces have led to a suggestion by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers at Plymouth that firms refusing to reinstate such workers should be removed from the list of Government contractors.Reclamation of land is proceeding at various places in Cornwall and Devon, and smallholders are to be placed on the land at once to take part in the work of reclamation. The extension of an electric cable works in Southampton will, on completion, provide work for 500 men. The employment of women as ship cleaners at Southampton is developing with the increase of shipping in the port. :
General. A number of districts are affected by the diversion of much coastwise traffic on to the already congested railways. The position, should, however, be improved by the Government scheme for the subsidisation of coastal traffic which has recently been announced.Farmers are claiming that they cannot pay the high wages and get their necessary work done in shorter hours.The claim that a reduced working week in shipbuilding and engineering would produce better output per man, does not appear to be substantiated.In the tin-mining districts, satisfaction is expressed on the action of the Government in making an inquiry into the non-ferrous mining industries.West Midlands.Unemployment. A decline of about 1,500 occurred in the live register during the week. A further slight increase took place in juvenile unemployment, owing to the school-leaving period.Resettlement. Owing to the shortage of English iron and steel many firms have been compelled to buy from America. In South Staffordshire, some thousands of tons have been imported, but the workmen are refusing to work up the material. One firm alone imported 500 tons for bolts and nuts, and are now experiencing difficulty in getting it handled.At the quarterly meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Pottery Industry,, it was pointed out that the absorption of disabled men to the agreed extent of 2^% of the total employees could not take place until a sufficient number of pivotal men had been, released, and until the coal ration is increased from the amount fixed in June, 1917, when the industry was at its lowest ebb.The chemical industry has nearly completed the change from war to peace production ; firms have orders in hand for products not manufactured before the war, and it is hoped that considerable business will be done in foreign markets previously monopolised by Germany.General. Resumption of work by the bakers has not led to complete reinstatement of the men who were on strike, as many men found their jobs were filled. The police strikers have not succeeded in bringing about any industrial development as a result of demonstrations and meetings held outside the premises of prominent manufacturers. The Birmingham Labour Party have passed a resolution calling upon &quot; all labour and trade union organisations to prepare at once for a general strike, united, swift and resolute.&quot;Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The increase in unemployment for the week ending the 1st August,, which was given provisionally as 24,658, proves to have been 32,343. Provisional figures for the week ending the 8th August show a further rise of approximately 7,500. The industries mainly affected by the coal strike are textiles, and iron, steel and metal, production. It is feared that the effects of the strike will continue for a considerable, time after its settlement.Resettlement. Congestion of timber ships in the docks at Hull is reported, and the&apos; quays and yards are stated to be piled with timber which cannot be removed. The delivery of orders is stated to be three or four months in arrears.The interposition of the Employment Council has prevented temporarily the closing down for lack of coal of a large glassworks at Barnsley, which would have involved a two months stoppage. It is feared, however, that unless restrictions on coal trucks going; north are removed the firm may. siill be compelled to close.Road work in Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield is seriously hampered by difficulty in. obtaining tarred macadam and all road material.General. The decision to resume work at the earliest possible moment in the South Yorkshire coal mines is affording considerable relief in Sheffield to manufacturers, endeavouring to keep open part or the whole of their establishments. Full resumption, is not immediately possible on account of accumulation of water, falls of roof and so forth, but the industrial, outlook is greatly relieved by the decision. . i In the Leeds area the position in the woollen and textile trade is somewhat unsettled,, and there is unrest among, the dockers in Hull,(C 1868) 2A2
North-Western.Unemployment. A further reduction of over 12,000 in the live register has been recorded in the fortnight ending the 8th August. The decrease is general throughout the division.Resettlement. The shortage of iron moulders still continues, and a lack of sheet metal workers is reported at Bolton. The Widnes chemical trade is quieter, and the Castner Kellner Alkali Co., Ltd., may have to begin short-time working unless an improvement occurs. In view of the transport difficulties prevalent in the division, the Employment Council recommend the immediate release of all wagon workers, and the utilisation for industrial purposes of all surplus transport vehicles lying in Government depots.General. So far as Manchester is concerned the general position is fairly quiet, but the position in Liverpool is very unsettled. Rioting has ceased, and there is superficial quiet, but unofficial agitation continues on the question of the re-instatement of the dismissed policemen.Northern.Unemployment. The live register for the division fell by over 1,000 during the week, the most important decreases occurring at Consett, Durham, Jarrow and Newcastle. At Stockton unemployment among men has increased for the fourth successive week, and the men&apos;s total has increased at Darlington, Middlesbrough, and Sunderland. In the &quot;Western part of the Division, the iron and steel industry at Workington and Whitehaven is largely responsible for unemployment.Resettlement. The Grinkle Park Mining&apos;Co., Staithes, report that the introduction of shorter hours has involved a drop of about 450 tons per week in the output of ore. Coke oven and by-product firms in County Durham complain that the railway companies refuse to supply trucks until the ship to be employed is actually in dock, and that the time is then too short for loading and shipping. Shipbuilding on the Wear is reported to be flourishing, orders already in hand being sufficient to keep the industry going for the next three or four years.  The Shields firms are all working to their fullest extent.General. The industrial outlook has brightened considerably. The resumption of work on Tees-side was satisfactorily complete, and the return to work on the part of the bakers has had a good effect on the workers and the general public. The possibility of the recent railway and police troubles affecting local conditions has become remote.Little has been heard of the nationalisation of coal mines, but it is thought that labour is concentrating on procuring a majority representation at the next general election, with a view to enforcing nationalisation as part of a programme of reform.Scotland.Unemployment. The position remains virtually unchanged, though a general tendency to decline is still shown. The general difficulty lies in the provision of work for the unskilled. This is emphasised especially at Leith, and at Kirkcaldy, where 80 per cent, of the male live register consists of general labourers or semi-skilled miners recently discharged from the Forces. There is a general expectation in the Dumbarton district of some improve-ment in the calico printing and dyeing industries, in which unemployment is most prevalent.Resettlement. The lack of housing continues a general source of difficulties. At Kirkcaldy the supply of local labour is insufficient in certain directions, and importation is impossible for want of accommodation. The same complaint comes from Falkirk, where the difficulty is accentuated by inadequate transit facilities to and from Alloa. In Glasgow, lads sent from Stornaway and the North as apprentices in the shipbuilding industries cannot obtain lodgings.A shortage of skilled men, especially draughtsmen and ironmoulders, is reported at Paisley, and difficulties are occurring in the same district owing to the continued shortage of woollen and cotton materials, steel plates and angle-irons for shipbuilding, and cast-iron castings.General. There is a satisfactory lull, with little likelihood of reversion to stormy conditions. The conditions of resumption of work at the mines and the decision in the matter of direct action are significant of more peaceful developments. Agitators are decreasing in numbers and finding it difficult to create grievances.
Wales.f Unemployment. A small decline occurred during the week in the live register for tho Division. The position, however, is still regarded as uncertain. Four hundred men have received notice of discharge at the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, Merthyr, but it is hoped that 200 may be re-engaged in the engineering portion of the works on repairs to colliery plant. No change has occurred at the works of the Ebbw Vale Iron, Steel and Coal Co. Although work cannot be resumed for four or five months, a large number of the men will probably be required for reconstruction and repairs.Resettlement. Some thousands of boxes of tinplates have been landed from America at 31s. per box, or 3s. less than present Welsh prices.Considerable colliery developments are to take place in the Aberdare area, where land has been &quot; pegged &quot; for the driving of three drifts.A considerable shortage of skilled men is reported in the carriage-making and motor-body building industry.General-The general position continues to be satisfactory. In the coal trades actual disputes have practically vanished, but there is a general outcry at the diminishing output.  Commercial circles are alarmed at the congestion in the docks.An embargo on overtime still exists as a result of the failure of negotiations between the engineers engaged in ship repairing and their employers on the demand for a minimum wage. There does not appear to be any chance of resumption of overtime or the re-opening of negotiations.Part V-Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Coal Miners.Yorkshire. Work was resumed on the 18th instant in such of the South Yorkshire coal-mines as were in a fit state. Resumption of work was prevented at the Frickley Colliery, however, where 2,000 miners are demanding the dismissal of several deputies who continued at work during the strike. Their action is unofficial. Delay *was caused in West Yorkshire by the engine-winders&apos; dispute, but on the 19th. instant the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Council decided to recommend a resumption of work and to discuss the points at issue afterwards.Scotland. A strike of under-managers and other underground officials began on the 15th instant at Viewpark Colliery, Uddingston, near Glasgow, owing to the alleged wrongful dismissal of one of the managers. About 700 miners are idle in consequence; the owners have advertised for a new manager, but the Scottish Mine Managers&apos; Association has advised its members not to apply.A stoppage which occurred at Coalburn, Lanarkshire, on the 16th July continues; the dispute concerns the method of applying the shorter working day. The Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Association is regarding the stoppage as a lock-out from the date on which the manage-ment refused to let the men descend at 8 a.m. and so long as train conditions remain unchanged.Representatives of the Lothian miners, together with Mr. John Robertson, M.P., and Mr. James Brown, M.P., attended a meeting at the Coal Controller^ Department in connection with the Polton miners&apos; dispute on the 19th instant. No settlement was reached, but nego-tiations are to be continued; in the meanwhile, the men&apos;s representatives are to report to their national union.It was reported on the 18th instant that the 1,000 miners on strike at Lochore, Fifeshire, since the 7th July, had accepted the employers&apos; wages offer.A stoppage of work was reported on the 14th instant at the Auchengeich Colliery, Chryston, owing to the alleged failure of the company to pay the proper rates of wages.Cumberland. A strike began at the Allhallows Colliery on the 2nd instant owing to a dispute between the management and the surface workers concerning the application of the 46^-hour week.  The Coal Controller is intervening.Staffordshire. A strike began on the&apos; 4th instant at Holly Bank Colliery, Walsall, owing to the refusal of the management to meet a certain checkweighman, as the men&apos;s representative, on deputations.  One thousand three hundred men are involved.Shale Miners.The miners employed in the Philipstown Shale Mines were idle on the 7th instant as a protest against the shale miners being excluded from the Coal Mines Bill. A resolution was passed that after the 13th instant the miners should remain idle every Saturday until an agreement was arrived at. -
A(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Engineering and Allied Trades.On the 14tb instant members of the A.S.E. employed in the Eoyal Dockyards, Plymouth,, balloted on the question of either accepting the Admiralty offer, referring their application to arbitration, or ceasing work to enforce their demands.  The Admiralty are offering an advanceLimestone Quarrymen. - 1A strike at West Calder (West Lothian), which began on the 26th June, has been settled, the mines having been bought by the Glasgow Iron and Steel Company, who are willing to pay the Sankey bonus of 2s. per day demanded by the men.Buildimg Trades.The strike at Carlisle, which began on the 23rd June and involved 2,000 men, was settled on the 15th instant. A 44-hour week was agreed upon, with 461 hours pay at Is. Id. per hour, and a proportionate increase for labourers, these conditions to remain in force until the 1st March, 1920.A strike is reported of 800 carpenters and joiners employed in the shipyards at South-ampton owing to a dispute on the question of the payment of allowances.Since the 26th July the men in the building and allied trades have been idle at Newtown. A week&apos;s notice had been given&quot; because the employers would not grant their demands for 5d. per hour advance to tradesmen and labourers. On the day before the notice expired the notice was withdrawn, but the employers, having no work for the men, refused to allow them to begin work. The men&apos;s claim for unemployment donation was refused at the Employment Exchange.Sea Officers.A strike began on the 11th instant at Bristol of captains, masters, mates and engine-drivers, members of the Masters&apos; and Mates&apos; Coastwise Steamers Guild who are engaged on coastwise traffic. The men were demanding a 48-hour week and overtime pay, and a flat rate of wages or an all-round increase of 15 per cent. The strike was settled on the 15th instant, when the owners&apos; offer of 10 per cent, increase on all aggregate wages, with  10 bonus,. Was accepted.Ship Painters.A strike of Merseyside ship painters began on the Uth inst., the men demanding extra allowances for certain classes of work.  Some 2,000 are involved.Cranemen.A sudden strike of cranemen occurred at Swansea docks on the 19th instant, the men-demanding a  5 5s. weekly minimum wage.  The strike is unofficial.Furniture Trade.It is reported that in Sheffield the lock-out notices in the furnishing trade were withdrawn on the 18th instant. It appears that the employers, who are members of the National Federation of Furniture Manufacturers, were not in favour of the lock-out, and only 12 acting under pressure carried out the Federation^ instructions.Woodworkers.The woodworkers at Lincoln, who have been on strike since the 14th May for the abolition of the piecework system, agreed to return to work on the 18th inst., pending the national settlement which it is understood will be reached at the end of the month. The wood-workers at Messrs. Marshall^, Gainsborough, who struck during the same week, returned to-work on the &apos;16th inst. pending the national settlement.Strikes Ended.The discharged soldiers on strike at the London County Council School of Arts and Crafts returned to work on the 15th instant. The Ministry of Labour has paid the deficiency in their allowances.The Hull trawler engineers, who began to strike on the 3rd June, demanding an advance in wages and the employment of two extra hands on all vessels, decided to resume work on the 18th instant on the terms which the owners offered in June, namely, revised rates of pay and one extra trimmer on all vessels of 130 feet and over.The strike at Messrs. Jack, agricultural implement makers, Maybole, was settled on the 12th instant; the men accepted the l\d. advance offered by the employers, with the stipulation, that at the end of two months they will receive the Is. 3d. and Is. Qd. per hour originally demanded.  The strike began on the 9th June, some 200 men being involved.
IllAll inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to: Intelligence Division,Ministry op Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W.I.of 2s. per week. Members of engineering and shipbuilding trades in the various Government dockyards are balloting on this same offer.Members of the Bradford Branch of the A.S.E., at a meeting on the 10th instant, passed a resolution urging that increased wages should be demanded in view of the fact that in the majority of cases wages of engineers were considerably lower than those of other craftsmen.Metal Trades.The Friendly Society of Ironfounders and the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers recently applied for a weekly advance of 15s., with equivalent advances for piece and lieu workers and apprentices. * On the refusal of the employers to grant these demands, a ballot was taken which resulted in favour of a strike. Notices expire on the 23rd instant; a national conference of delegates meets on the 21st at Manchester to consider the position.Co-operative Employees.As a - retaliatory measure to the strike notices issued by the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees in parts of South Lancashire and the Airedale district of Yorkshire, the Co-operative Societies have issued a notice to terminate contracts on the 23rd instant with their employees in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire and North Wales.Agricultural Labourers.The threatened strike of agricultural workers in Warwickshire has been averted. A strike of 100 farm labourers was due to begin on the 19th instant at Shenstone, Worcestershire ; the men are demanding extra pay for the harvest, no special rates having been fixed for Worcestershire by the Agricultural Wages Board. The strike only lasted one day and a settlement was reached.The farmers in South Essex have refused to grant the 50s. minimum wage for a 48-hour week demanded by the labourers. The labourers have decided to take a ballot on the question of submitting their demand to the Central Wages Board under the threat of a strike.Building Trades.The building trade employees at Berwick recently demanded an increase of 5d. an hour. The employers offered an increase of 3d.; to this the men agreed, subject to the extra 2d. being decided by arbitration. A claim by the Reading building trade employees for an advance of 3d. an hour has not been established by the Court of Arbitration. It is reported that the building trade employees in the Bristol district on work for the Government have not been paid the rates fixed by the local National and Central Conciliation Boards ; a strike is threatened in the neighbourhood if a satisfactory settlement is not reached.:Tramwaymen.The Sheffield tramwaymen, having received some concessions from the Tramways Com-mittee, decided on the 15th instant not to declare a strike for the time being, though they threaten to ask permission from their Executive Council to use that weapon if the remainder of the demands are not conceded.JPottery Trade.The threatened strike at Messrs. Doulton&apos;s, Lambeth, has been averted. Operatives at Stoke-on-Trent have applied for an increase of 20 per cent, in the bonus for all grades of workers, to operate from the 1st September.R. S.
