From a general re vie w of the possible overseas markets it is clear that, if incur coiuLeroial prosperity is to be restored, much depends upon a g^eat development of trade within the Empire.     I would direct attention to a decision of the Imperial War Cabinet that, in making their purchases, Government Departments throughout the Empire should give preference to British traders, both as regards price and terms of contract.    This principle should be followed also by local authorities and by the Crown Agents in their purchases on behalf of the Grown Colonies,MIt appears that Departments have been waiting for the WarCabinets authority before acting upon this instructjUn.Sir Auckland Geddes hopes that the War Cabinet, beforeParliai&amp;ent adjourns, -/ill issue a general instruction to all government Departments to the effect that, when purchasingmaterials, thoy will give preference to British traders.(Initialled) U.P.A.H.3,Whitehall Gardens, 8.17. 15th August,1919.
