This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.WAK CABINET.E SITUATION IN NORTH-WEST EUSSIA.MEMOEANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE WAR.I circulate two telegrams addressed to the Prime Minister by Representatives of Commerce and Industry in North-West Russia, and by a Conference of the Zemstvos and ^ Municipalities of the Northern Region, which I have received from the Prime Minister.h      mh August, 1919. WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Prime Minister, London. - 19th August, 1919.The representatives of commerce and industry of the whole northern district of * Russia take the liberty of addressing you at the present moment, which is so ominous and fateful for the future of our country, in the hope that our cry of distress will be heard by you. Our whole district, and especially the town of Archangel, has been saved from the ruin and destruction which devastate the rest of Russia, thanks to the arrival last August of the Allied, and particularly the British forces. Some time ago American and French forces left us, but the population saw them depart undisturbed in its mind, because the British remained, and they represented the main forces and the Chief Command. Rumours spread from time to time as to the possibility of the British leaving too, but they were never officially supported ; on the contrary, not later than about six weeks ago these rumours were semi-officially declared to be devoid of foundation. Then, only about a month ago, like a bolt from - the blue, came the announcement that the British were evacuating, leaving the town and the whole district to its fate and to its own forces, which were considered inadequate. It is difficult to give an idea in mere words of the effect this announcement has produced on the population. Towns have been abandoned before, even during the late war, but that was done in moments of inexorable necessity, when under the stress of tragic conditions no choice was possible, and even in such cases the population which remained behind could hope that the enemy entering the town would have mercy, war after all (officially, at least) being waged against nations and States, but not against individuals, not against the peaceful population. What, in view of this, must we think of the situation created for us and for our town by the withdrawal of the British forces ? The war is ended, and gloriously ended for the Allies. The fighting they had to carry on in almost every part of the world is over. There is no more stress of war conditions and war necessity for them. That on the one hand. On the other, the population of the northern district of Russia, and particularly of the town of Archangel, is bound to the British nation, not only by the common ties which bound our two nations together in suffering-and common sacrifice in the great war, but also by the special ties of commerce during several centuries. We, the inhabitants of a town whose first historical traditions speak - of English friendship and bear the stamp of British influence, and above all, we who only a year ago greeted the British forces as our real saviours, who blessed the moment of their arrival, who lived and started to reconstruct our own national life under their protection and guidance, and who have done everything that will eventually give our enemies an excuse to make a bloody reckoning with everyone of us. Is great, generous, victorious England going to do that, to take upon her conscience all the horrors that may and will happen, that it was in her power to prevent, that (excuse us for the daring of the expression, but the tragedy of the moment imposes on us full sincerity) it was her duty to prevent after the moral obligations she undertook by coming here? We understand that the British Government in abandoning us is doing so because there is a great movement of public opinion in this direction, but we cannot believe that this public opinion is sufficiently instructed as to the real state of affairs here. Can those who demand the withdrawal of the British forces conscientiously assert that the town. will not be given over to massacre and merciless revenge ?   If they can let them declare it publicly, but if not, and we are
sure they cannot, how can they ignore the position created for us by the fact that England has stayed a year with us, and how can they ask their country to leave a friend an old, true and now helpless friend in need ? We, the representatives of the groups which have come into closer contact than any others with England, who have been taught by our predecessors and have learnt for ourselves to love and admire her great culture and free institutions, feel it our duty to raise our weak voice in this tragic hour, believing that Great Britain will be true to her great traditions, and that a nation of chivalry and deep political insight will not allow the glorious page it has written in the annals of North Russia to he obliterated. We end our appeal with the words which covered the flags with which we met your volunteers on the day of their arrival in our midst only a few months ago, the words which were on all our lips and in all our hearts : &quot;A friend in need is a friend indeed.&quot; Archangel Timber Merchants&apos; Association, President, Shergold ; Archangel Exchange Committee, President, Olsen.Representatives of the northern region of Russia elected by the entire population of the region and representing the democracy of the region, having assembled here in Archangel at the Conference of the Zemstvo and Municipalities, have beard with misgiving of the recall of the British troops. In our country&apos;s cause and in fulfilment of the duty imposed on us by our electors, we appeal to you, the Allied Democracies, and Governments, as follows : You are aware that Russia, your honest Ally in the struggle with Germany and Austria, is now in a state of terrible civil war. The horrors of economical disorganization and savagery have reached their climax. The peaceful population are dying out, murdered and robbed. The so called Bolsheviks having scorned the peopled will as expressed by the Constituent Assembly, force the people by bayonet and machine-gun to acknowledge them as rulers. They do not permit the free expression of the people&apos;s will and have again introduced into Russia an autocratic regime with even greater terror and bloodshed. Supported by Germany, with the intention to defeat us, they have in every way deceived the Russian people. They promised peace and gave us Brest; they promised freedom, instead of which each non-Bolshevist thought or word is followed by imprisonment and execution. Instead of the promised bread the)r gave ruin, unemployment and terrible famine. They promised power to the workers and now none but their partisans are allowed to vote. The sale of Russia to German and neutral bankers and agreement with the servants of the old regime complete the picture of Bolshevist tyranny. Institutions expressive of the peoples will, such as municipalities and Zemstvos, even the Constituent Assembly, all were dispersed and scorned as they scorned universal suffrage. The Russian people could not bear this heavy yoke. From the very beginning of their rule insurrections in different parts of Russia took place against the Soviet Government. Siberia, the south, the &quot;Volga region, the north and west have closely surrounded Central Russia, where the Bolshevist rulers still hold their cruel sway over the peaceful population. Unarmed and scattered among the villages, this population is unable to withstand the well-armed Bolshevist Army, even though this army is mobilized by force and terrorized into fighting, and thousands of the population go to their death for the happiness of their country for the people&apos;s freedom. Our native North, which never has known either nobles or landlords, was one of the first to rise. During the unequal armed struggle your troops arrived with words of encouragement and with promises of brotherly assistance. We believed you, we agreed unconditionally to the establishment here of a front against Germany and her allies, the Bolshevists. The struggle became a war. We believed that the work once begun would be carried on to the end. We had no reason to disbelieve the honourable words of our Allies, our loyalty and the millions of lives given by Russia in your victorys causes were our guarantee. With your help we overcame distances far exceeding the areas of your countries. With your help we created a Russian force which sustains most of the burden in this struggle. Unfortunately our numbers are few in this region and we who have sacrificed most of our healthy sons for your victory over Germany will be unable to withstand the forcibly mobilized Bolshevik forces who fight under threat of machine guns. The presence of your troops was a moral support to us, allowing us to gain time during which the Bolsheviks steadily neared their downfall. We were mistaken. You are recalling those eight or ten thousand men, of whom half are volunteers, who came to our assistance in the name of of humanity.   Our army, young and small in numbers, has not yet regained its moral
strength after five years of incredible trials and, without support, loses the strength of will to defend its homes. Old men, peasant guerillas, who took up arms to defend their villages in mortal anguish drop their rifles. Hundreds of thousands of the population, mostly peasants and workmen, deceived in their hopes, will, upon the arrival here of the Bolsheviks, become the victims of their cruel vengeance. And to think only that your volunteers, as a reserve, could save us from massacre, starvation and ruin ! We, the representatives of the democracy, appeal to you with the request to think of the blow to our unhappy country which your action entails. We appeal to the feeling of human justice and believe in its triumph. Drawn into the present form of struggle we cannot stop half way. The victory of Bolshevism means death to us, and we, losing our country, cannot find safety beyond the sea. For the sake of the sanctity of human life you must leave your forces here so that in the last hour of our trials you may in humanity save those of us who are still alive. We do not wish for civil war or for its continuation. We wish to be a free nation, to work in peace and freedom. This is why we cannot abandon the fight. Disorganization in the Centre and ever increasing revolt betoken the end. The dawn is near and we look into the future with anguish, uncertain of our ability to hold out to the end. This is the picture created by the departure of your troops. You plunge us into a multitude of calamities and give new encouragement to the Bolsheviks to mock at the unhappy population. We ask you to believe this cry of despair and pain for the people who elected us which is caused by your decision. President of Conference of Zemstvos and Municipalities of Northern Region, SkomorohofF; Tice-Presidents, Edovin and Grenkoff; Secretaries, Melehoffand Antushevitch.   N.R. 1412.
