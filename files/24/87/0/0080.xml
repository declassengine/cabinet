This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys GovernmentSECRET.WAR CABINET.THE DANGER TO ARMENIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate the accompanying Note of an interview which took place on the 23rd instant between the Armenian General Andranik and a member of my Staff.30th August, 1919.Note of an Interview, with General Andranik at the War Office . on Saturday, the 23rd August.1. General Andranik, who only speaks Armenian, was accompanied by an Armenian interpreter and another Armenian officer.2. He strongly represented that, for reasons with which you are familiar, the British troops now in the Caucasus should not be withdrawn until Armenia was in a position to withstand her enemies.3. General Andranik and his countrymen understood that one of the first principles of the Allied cause was the defence of the independence and the liberties of small nations. In this belief he and his countrymen had fought for 4 years against the Turks, and now that they were faced with the probability of a hostile combination of Turks, Georgians, and Azerbaijans, which, having finished with Armenia, would turn upon the armies of General Denikin, they trusted that they would not be entirely deserted by their Allies. The least that could be done, if the withdrawal was finally determined upon, was to supply munitions.4. General Andranik, himself, was willing to return to Armenia and to raise two divisions, provided that he was assured of the provision of the necessary arms and equipment, and that he was supplied with a minimum of 20, or, if possible, 40, General Staff officers to assist him in the organization and command of these levies.5. Finally, he pointed out that although the Peace Conference appeared to consider that it was to the United States of America that Armenia should look for assistance, the Armenians themselves had always regarded Great Britain as their true protector, and he considered that the vital interests of Great Britain would be more seriously affected than those of any other Power by the triumph of ArmemVs enemies.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
