SECRET.This Document i^42SL !2B2.fa of83MINISTRY  OF  FOOD,If   -S&amp;s^ ^^r^^port for Month ending 15th August 1919.PART L-ACTION TAKEN.On August 5th the Food Controller gave evidence before the Select Committee on High Prices and Profits. In the course of his statement, Mr. Roberts dealt at length with the main causes of high prices, and the difficulties to be considered in connection with any scheme for regulating the retail price of commodities. He pointed out that control is apt to be successful only where it is complete, and that in face of any serious shortage partial control is useless aud dangerous. In illustration he referred to the experience of the Ministry in the matters of fish, rabbits, and potatoes, where control was, in the first instance, restricted to the fixing of retail prices, and to the recent difficulties in connection with bacon, where the wholesale price left the retailer with an insufficient margin of profit. Mr. Roberts accordingly urged that the effective national control of prices involved the control of supplies and distribution at all stages, either by way of direct buying operations on the part of the State, or by supervised co-operation between the traders and the responsible Department.An example of the latter method was to be seen in the case of oils and fats where de-control was followed by rampant speculation, in raw materials. This speculation was effectively checked by an Order restricting dealings to licensed firms. The next step was to form associations of all the trades concerned and to arrange with the crushers for the sale of manufactured products at a price which would enable margarine to be sold everywhere at a maximum price of Is. 2d. per lb. This arrange-ment has the effect of giving the small retailer a living margin, while the larger and better organised establishments can and do continue to sell the best quality of margarine at the old controlled price of Is. per lb. notwithstanding that the price of raw materials is nearly doubled. The Food Controller indicated that, in his opinion, this method of supervision was the only mode of control which could be contemplated as permanent.Apart from any questions of profiteering or scarcity, high prices were attributable either to the increased cost of production as measured in money or the increased prices demanded by producers in other countries.Mr. Roberts emphasised the importance of a Central Costings Department with a ,view to determining reasonable margins of profit at the various stages of production and distribution. He pointed out, however, that the determination of a proper margin was a difficult matter and cited the case of bread in which bakers were allowed an average margin of 23s. for a sack of flour, when some bakers seemed to require a margin of 30s. to 35s., while others, working more efficiently, could make a profit on 10s. a sack.Further Action against Profiteering in Food. With a view to preventing profiteering in articles of food which are uncontrolled or subject only to partial control, the Food Controller has under consideration a scheme under which additional powers will be given to Food Commissioners and Food Committees. It is felt that in the case of certain foods, such as fresh vegetables, rabbits and fish, the Local Food Control Authorities could take action, governed by the immediate circumstances, where a Central Authority could not obtain a knowledge of the day-to-day conditions.It is proposed that local retail prices should be fixed, if necessary daily or weekly, and that, in order not to endanger supplies, local traders should be consulted on the ruling wholesale prices in the usual markets. In addition, Food Committees will be empowered to arrange with traders for the. opening of markets, where food will be sold at agreed prices ; to obtain the co-operation of selected shops in fixing reasonable prices ; to make the exhibition of price lists compulsory and to enforce an Order prohibiting the maximum price of foodstuffs being described as the controlled price or the Government price.A  (33)8797  Pkl6  150  8/19  E&amp;S A
In addition the Food Control Committees will doubtless be invited, in some districts at least, to assist in the administration of the provisions of the Profiteering Bill.International Food Questions. The establishment of Inter-Allied (Consultative) Food Committees, on the lines suggested by the Supreme Economic Council, has been considered and it has been agreed with French and Italian representatives that such a Committee should be set up to deal with cereals. This Committee will be provisional in character and its headquarters will be in London. It will not carry our a repartition or pooling programme, and each country represented will provide its own finance and tonnage. It will co-ordinate action in connection with food policy, with a view to bringing producers and consumers into close relation and will appoint the necessary buying agencies.The appointment of a similar body as regards sugar and imported meat is under consideration.Maintenance of Control. In the early part of this year the policy of the Govern-ment was to demobolise the Ministry of Food and certain foods were accordingly released, in whole or in part, from control. The decision that the Ministry should be continued for at least another year has necessitated an adjustment of policy, and during the past month various steps have been taken to strengthen or resume the supervision of the prices, supply and distribution of different commodities. The conditions of control in the case of meat, milk, margarine, bacon and other foodstuffs have been under consideration, but other questions, such as the control of potatoes and fish, are not yet ripe for discussion.In any event the work of the Ministry will be heavy and onerous and in view of the desire of administrative and technical officers to return to their normal occupations, the question of staff is causing considerable anxiety.Meat. The prices to be paid to producers of home-grown meat after the end of July have been the subject of detailed consideration, and a provisional schedule of prices for the period from August 1919 to June 1920 has been approved. The prices range from 79s. to 95s. per cwt., whereas the prices for last winter ranged from 75s. to 85s. This increase is due to the higher prices now ruling for labour, hay, feeding stuffs and roots ; it will mean an addition of i\d. per lb. to the retail price of home-grown meat as from 30th. September next. This will bring the average price of home-grown beef to Is. Qd. per lb., while it is anticipated that the average price of imported meat will be Is. O^d. per lb.The present difference in price between home-grown and imported meat is M. per lb., and it is held that with the full differentiation of 5fcL during the coming winter, the demand for imported meat at a comparatively low price would so reduce the consumption of home-grown meat that the available supplies would not be taken up. To ensure the approximation of demand to supply, it is proposed to vary the prices of the two classes of meat, so that they may be offered for sale on an economic parity. This will be done by raising the price of imported meat and reducing that of home-grown, while at the same time ensuring that there is no loss to the Ministry over the double adjustment.   The actual differentiation in price is still under consideration.Milk. The winter prices to be paid to milk producers have not been finally settled, but a provisional average figure of 2s. 9J. per gallon, as against 2s. 3d for last winter, has been approved.The estimates of farmers&apos; costs have revealed a wide difference of opinion among the various authorities and the prices placed before the Food Controller have ranged from 2s. Sd. to 3s. h\d. per gallon. A careful comparison of pre-war with present costs seems to justify the price of 2s. 9d., but the agricultural interests will be given a further opportunity of submitting data before a final decision is taken. In view of -the discussion on winter milk prices, it is of interest to note that the Live Stock &apos;Commissioners report that farmers are making no serious reductions in their herds, and that where cows are being disposed of the cause is labour troubles and not the price of milk.The summer milk prices in Scotland have been adjusted to meet the increase in the cost of production attributable to the drought in that country, and for the period August 11th to August 31st the price payable to Scottish producers has been raised by id. a gallon.Owing to the increased cost of production and the fall in the American exchange, it has been found necessary to raise the price of full cream condensed milk to Is. 2\d. per tin, which was the price last winter.
Bacon, Earns and Lard.-^-The control of the prices/supply and distribution of baebii, hams and lard has been re-imposed. Stocks have been requisitioned and arrangements made for the Government purchase of future supplies. It is not proposed to introduce a system of rationing to the individual consumer. On the present schedule of retail prices for bacon, it is estimated that there will be a loss of 500,000L a month and the question of prices will shortly be re-considered.Butter. Owing to the shortage of stocks and prospective supplies the butter ration has been reduced to II ounces per week, but it is hoped that the 2-ounce ration will, be restored early next year.Oils and Fats. Under the system of supervision established in respect of oils and fats, prices have fallen during the last month. Linseed oil is down 15L per ton, while the prices ahead for palm kernels and other nuts and for the resultant oils, are all on a descending scale. Palm, kernels, for example, are being accepted at 45Z.. for September and 401. for December. The services of trade associations have been utilised in the administration of the Seeds, Oils and Fats Order which restricts-dealings to licensed persons, and this expedient, reducing as it does; the need for departmental interference with the usual methods of production and distribution, has met with considerable success.In the matter of cattle cakes and meals, arrangements have been made with the producers to provide supplies to the farmers at fixed prices. Linseed cake, which is in general demand as a feeding stuff, will be sold at 251. per ton ex mill, whereas it is anticipated that, on an unsupervised market, the price would have risen to 301. or more.&apos; The fixing of reasonable prices for feeding stuffs has enabled the Food Controller to check with accuracy one important element in the cost of the production of meat and milk, and has thus prevented an undue rise in the price of these commodities. Imported cakes and meals present a difficulty, as the fixing of prices might restrict supplies. It is hoped, however, that an early solution of this problem will be found. The general feeding stuffs situation is being dealt with by means of an Order which will eliminate speculation by restricting dealings to persons legitimately engaged in the trade and this Order will be administered through trade associations, in the same wray as the Seeds, Oils and Fats Order.While the situation with regard to the Egyptian cotton seed crop was under consideration, a telegram was received through the Foreign Office from Field-Marshal Allenby to the effect that speculation was already rife in the forthcoming cotton seed crop and that it would probably be necessary to institute some measure of local control; and enquiring whether it was proposed to take any steps in the matter. Field-Marshal Allenby has been informed that the Government are anxious to obtain as much cotton seed as possible, and that the price should hot be inflated by speculation, and the Food Controller has sent out to Egypt a member of his staff and a representative of the trade to concert means of obtaining the residue of the supplies of cotton cake and the exportable surplus of the forthcoming cotton seed crop.Maize. As it is important to the supply of milk and home-grown meat that farmers should be provided with adequate quantities of maize at reasonable prices, it has been decided to continue a system of control. The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies have accordingly been requested to arrange for the importation of maize and maize products at the rate of 150,000 tons per month. Prices will be fixed, but, owing to market advances in exporting countries and to the adverse exchanges, the figures will be considerably higher than those now prevailing. North American maize will be sold at 105s. per quarter and Argentine and South African maize at 65s.   The importation of maize meal will also be controlled.Tea, Coffee and Cocoa-Owing to the increase in freight charges and the fall in the exchange, there has been an average rise of id. per lb. in the cost of tea. The supply of tea at a retail price of 2s. 2d. to 2s. id. per lb. is still plentiful however, and the tea available at these prices is of good average quality. Cocoa prices are high, but the stocks are satisfactory. Arrangements have been made for the export of low-grade cocoa which is not required in the home trade. This will tend to relieve congestion at the quays and warehouses. Coffee prices, though high, have not shown signs of any considerable advance.Dried Fruits. In accordance with the decision to control the supply, distribution and prices of dried fruits, the Dried Fruits (Restriction) Order, 1919, has been issued, and a purchasing programme, involving an expenditure of 10,439,000Z., has been drawn up with the sanction of H.M. Treasury. An increase in retail prices during the coming winter appears to be unavoidable.A  8797 . A 2
, Fresh Fruit and Jam. The prices of stone fruits sole! to jam manufacturers for the purposes of their &quot;Business have been controlled; it has been decided, however, not&apos; to fix prices for plums sold to the general public. The Apples (Prices) Order, 1918, under which the maximum price of all apples is fixed at 9d, per lb., is still in force, and the question of any alterations in its terms will be considered as soon as information, is available as to the home crop and the foreign supplies.The Ja&quot;m (Prices) Order is under revision and it is hoped that the price of several varieties of jam will be reduced.   Two. pulping stations have been sold.Potatoes. With the exception of a few small lots which are being sold to farmers and pig breeders as feeding stuff, the 1918 crop of potatoes has been disposed of. The Committees appointed to deal with claims from growers are working satisfactorily.The crop, for 1919 varies considerably from one part of the country to another^ There is promise of a good yield in all parts of England except the North, where, as in Scotland, the drought has had a bad effect. Reports from Ireland are satisfactory, and if export to foreign countries is prohibited, the Irish crop should cover the deficiency in. the North.Fresh Registration for Meat, Butter and Sugar.  In view of the decision to maintain a system of rationing for meat, butter and sugar, it will be necessary to carry out a fresh registration of customers in September. The present system of registration is no longer in a high state of efficiency. The counterfoils were issued in June 1918, and many of these have now been lost. While the tendency during the earlier part of this year was in the direction of de-control, a certain slackness on the part of Food Committees was inevitable, and the provisions for tracing removals were not fully observed. The result is that retailers&apos; lists of customers have been swollen by the addition of new names, and the failure to remove the names of those who have lapsed. This leads to an excessive distribution of the various rationed commodities. As supplies will require to be carefully controlled during the coming winter, this position could not be allowed to continue, &apos;and the re-registration of the public with retailers became inevitable. With the issue of the new ration cards, the requirements of retailers and establishments will be carefully re-assessed so that an equitable distribu-tion of rationed commodities may be ensured. It is hoped that the efficient administration of the new system of registration will enable the Ministry to avoid the necessity of rationing commodities on the coupon system. The cost of the re-registration of consumers is estimated to be about 200,0001.Road Transport.   The Road Transport Board has been transferred to the Ministry, and arrangements are being made which are calculated to facilitate the transport of foodstuffs in cases of urgency or difficulty.Congestion at the Ports. The congestion at the ports, and especially at Liverpool, continues to be a cause of considerable anxiety. On Saturday, the 16th August, for example, forty vessels were waiting berths at Liverpool, and berths could not be found for more than five, and of these only two were able to proceed with the work of unloading. It is feared that unless this state of affairs is promptly remedied, ship-ments on consignment from the United States will be considerably diminished. The matter has been taken up with the Departments concerned, and arrangements are being made (1) to facilitate coastwise traffic, (2) to provide for transport by means of motor lorries, and (3) to minimise delay by instituting a system of through rates from inland towns in America to inland towns in this country.Industrial Unrest. Steps are being taken, as far as foodstuffs are concerned, to meet any emergency that may arise.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.Following upon the decision to resume control over the supply, distribution and prices of certain foodstuffs, the following Orders have been issued : 1. The Imported Bacon, Hams and Lard (Requisition) Orc^er 1919, with complementary orders on the prices of imported and home-produced bacon, hams and lard.2. The Imported Cheese (Requisition) Order 1919, with complementary orders -;        1 *    on importers&apos; prices and returns.3. The Dried Fruits (Requisition) Order 1919.The Stone Fruits (Jam Manufacturers and Prices) Order 1919, dated August 2nd, fixes the maximum prices to be paid by jam manufactures for greengages, damsons and plums, and cancels existing contracts.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Stocks.As a result of the lower rate of imports of wheat and larger deliveries of flour from mills, the decrease in the stocks of wheat and flour in the United Kingdom in July (146,000 tons) was greater than the decrease in June (92,000 tons), though j ust equal to the decrease in July a year ago. Stocks remaining on 1st August (1,168,000 tons) were only three fourths of those a year ago, but they still represent total requirements to the end of the present cereal year, with a balance of 520,000 tons, or 3^ weeks supply, available to be carried forward. Owing to the difficulty of estimating farm stocks as the end of the cereal year approaches, the decrease shown in the stocks of other cereals (220,000 tons) contains a certain margin of error. The small arrivals of oats, maize and rice, certainly brought about a marked decrease in the stocks of these cereals, but there was an increase of 52,000 tons in the stock of barley other than that still on the farms.Of the stocks of meat and provisions in cold stores and importers&apos; warehouses on July 1st and August 1st, those of refrigerated meat just recovered -the decrease of 20,000 tons which occurred in June, thus bringing the total to 72,600 tons, or 2\ weeks&apos; total requirements of butcher&apos;s meat. Canned meats (40,200 tons) showed an increase of 6,800 tons on a quantity which already represented approximately a pre-war year&apos;s supply. Following upon heavy imports, stocks of bacon and hams rose by 16,500 tons to 44,200 tons, the highest point reached since April 1st, though this is still less than half the quantity held a year ago. The steady fall in the stocks of lard which had been proceeding for several months was arrested in July, and concurrently with the renewal of imports, margarine again appeared in&quot; stock in appreciable quantity (5,400 tons). The increase in the stocks of butter remained small in spite of the seasonal home supplies available, but cheese rose to a relatively high level (10,700 tons).&apos; Stocks of sugar fell by 57,000 tons to 285,000 tons, whicli is approximately the quantity held also a year ago. There was a further increase in the very large stocks of cocoa, but in the case of tea the high level of the preceding month was somewhat reduced by the low arrivals of July, while stocks of coffee remained practically unaffected by the import and export movements.Imports.&apos; The rate of import of the principal foods and feeding stuffs remained fairly steady throughout July, and the average weekly figure (221,900 tons) compares favourably with that for June (214,500 tons), and with the weekly average for the year to date: The Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order No. 2,1919, dated 21st July, prohibits the brewing of beer below an original gravity of l,010oand fixes the average original gravity of all beer brewed in England, Scotland and Wales at l,044o and in Ireland at l,051o. This Order revokes the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Ireland Order 1919 and the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order 1919 and Clauses 1, 2 and 3 relating to beer in the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order 191.7.The Milk Summer Prices (Amendment) No. 2 Order authorises an increase of 4d. per gallon in the price for milk delivered in Scotland between 11th and 31st August.The Butter (Distribution) Order and the Butter (Rationing) Order reduce by 25 per cent, the amount of butter to be obtained by retailers, catering establishments and institutions and make the per capita allowance to consumers 1-1 ozs. per week.&apos; The Veal (Restriction of Sales) Order, 1919, prohibits the sale of veal except to manufacturers of sausages, meat pies, &amp;c.Clauses 1 to 6 and Clause 10 of the Bread Order, 1918, have been revoked, thus cancel-ling the prohibition against delivery of bread less than 12 hours old and removing certain restrictions as to the use of ingredients in bread.. . Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions during the four weeks ending August 2nd was 1,646, of which $2 per cent, were successful.
(1.81,200 tons). As a result of the steady improvement in recent months, &quot;the total of such imports for the first seven months of the year is practically equal to the total/for the corresponding period of 1916, and in the case of oil, oilseeds, and cake, quoted separately, this year shows a substantial improvement.- As regards cereals, the outstanding feature in July was the large quantity of barley received, viz., at the rate of 30,200 tons per week, or five times the rate of arrivals for the first six months of the year. On the other hand; weekly arrivals of oats (1,100 tons) and maize (6,800 tons) were only about half the previous rate. Wheat and flour showed a slight decrease on the preceding month, but were still substantially higher than the average for the year. An interesting feature is that the proportion of imports coming in the form of flour during the first seven months of this year is just half what it was a year ago, so that the feeding staffs position is thereby improved to the extent of well over a thousand tons a week.Imports of refrigerated meat, at 17,500 tons per week, showed a sharp recovery on the very low figures for June, and left a substantial margin over current require-ments. The same applies, to the imports of bacon, which moved upwards during the month and showed the very satisfactory weekly rate of 17,000 tons. Weekly arrivals of lard (5,100 tons), cheese (2,600 tons) and condensed milk (4,800 tons) were all very large in comparison with recent figures, and margarine, which after a long absence from the return reappeared in small quantities in June, rose steadily till it reached 800 tons in the last week of July. Butter, with an average weekly rate of 1,400 tons, was received in smaller quantities, and the movement within the. month was in a downward direction.Total net imports of sugar showed a fall from 202,000 tons&apos; in June to 140,000 tons in July, which leaves a deficit on seasonal requirements on the present ration basis. For the first time for a considerable period, arrivals of tea (2,960 tons per week) were slightly below current requirements. Imports of coffee at 1,600 tons per week were sufficient to cover current needs and allow of a weekly re-export of 1,300 tons, and those of cocoa (3,050 tons) maintained the very high average for this year.Butchers Meat. A descending scale of monthly prices for live stock is now in operation, and consequently supplies of home-grown meat in Great Britain tend&apos; to form a glut towards the end of the month at the expense of the early weeks of the following month. Thus, following upon the very large quantity of 20,500 tons for the last week of June, supplies fell to 10,300 tons, and rose again to 17,500 tons in the last week of July. It is hoped to overcome this irregularity of supplies in the future by making the stages in the scale fortnightly instead of monthly. The average weekly home supplies of meat in Great Britain for July were 15,300 tons, and the average issues of imported meat were 9,000 tons, representing a iceekly consumption rate of 24,300 tons. This compares with a weekly rate of 18^900 tons a year ago, of which 6,900 tons were imported meat, and with a rate of 26,500 tons for June 1916, when the imported meat included was 6,500 tons.Flour. Deliveries of flour from mills and releases of flour from imported stocks rose from a weekly rate of 92,600 tons in June to 99,100 tons in July. Over a period of 12 weeks the rate was 99,000. tons, which compares with a rate of 100,100 tons for the corresponding weeks of 1918. The available data point to a total rate of consumption approximately equal to that of a year ago, which, in view of the increased population dependent,upon supplies, represents a decrease of 2 to 3 per cent, in the per capita consumption. A greater decrease might have been anticipated from the larger supplies of other food stuffs this year, especially meat, for the present rate per head is still considerably in excess of the pre-war rate.Fish. The following table illustrates the supplies of fish during July and their distribution: Consumption.Fish Supplies in July,July 1919,June 1919.July 1918.U.K. landings, monthly total  -     -     -     -* Coastal markets, average weekly supply  -Provincial markets, average weekly supply Billingsgate Market, average weekly supply-Tons.117,200 7,900 2,000 3,100Tons.65,300 7,400 1,900-2,900Tons.52,900 3,200 2,000 2,300
The July total is swollen by the large quantities of herring landed at Scottish ports, of which a considerable proportion is retained for curing at this season. If these are excluded, landings of other fish are 54,000 tons, 47,200 tons, and 32,100 tons for July 1919, June 1919, and July 1918 respectively. It appears therefore, that while the.total supplies show a very marked increase, as regards the proportion reaching large inland consuming areas, July shows little improvement on June, and .still compares unfavourably with the position a year ago.Other Foodstuffs. During July the weekly rate of cheese distribution, taken with the free supplies of home cheese, represented about 2,500 tons per week available for consumption in the United Kingdom, as compared with a pre-war weekly average for the year of 3,000 tons. The weekly production of margarine fell from 6,600 tons in June to 6,000 tons in July,- though the latter was still considerably above the rate for July 1918, viz., 4,200 tons; and there were in addition this year certain&apos;imported supplies. The distribution of butter remained on the basis of 2 ozs. per head in Great Britain, which was approximately. the quantity distributed a year ago. It is estimated that, even if supplies of margarine to manufacturers be excluded, the total quantity of butter and margarine available for direct consumption in the United Kingdom in July was about 500 tons per week in excess of that of July 1918.Prices.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour show for August 1st a further increase in the average retail food prices. The increase since July 1914 is now 117 per cent., as.against 109 per cent.:dn 1st July 1919, representing an increase of nearly 4 per cent, during the month. Last July there was a similar rise, and the price index is still just below that of a year ago.&apos; The quotation of the price of the new crop of potatoes on August 1st in place of that of the old crop as on July 1st has a regular marked effect upon the index. This year it means an increase of 79 per cent, in the price quoted, which alone represents an increase of about 4 per cent, in the general price level. This is much greater than usual, the price of new potatoes being returned as 53 per cent, above their price a year ago. Eggs show a further seasonal increase of 9 per cent., and the effect of the new bacon prices is reflected in an increase of 3 per cent. On the other hand, the prices of imported meat reflect the reduction in the maximum by id, per lb., and fish has fallen 6 per cent. The reduction of Id. per quart in the maximum price of milk appears as a reduction of only 1 per cent, in the average price, because quite a number of places where milk was formerly below the maximum have added Id. per quart, thus counterbalancing the reductions in those places which were previously at the maximum.As regards wholesale prices, the rates for imported beef and mutton were adjusted to meet the reduction in the maximum retail prices. Canadian bacon continued to rise, from 192s. lOd. to 201s. 2d. per cwt., a3 did tea also, Indian advancing from Is. If d. to Is. %\d. per lb., and Ceylon from Is. to Is. Id. per lb. Prices in the oilseeds and cake markets were very disturbed. Linseed rose from 1,045s. to 1,100s. per ton within the month, while cottonseed, after doubling in price during June, fell back from 700s. to 670s. per ton. The average price of palm kernels in July was 905s. per ton as against 865s. for June, but the actual movement within the month was downwards from 920s. to 900s. per ton. The price of oilseed cake, which had hitherto remained relatively stable, snowed a sharp rise, linseed cake going from 380s. to 520s. and palm kernels from 300s. to 350s. per ton.
