As a result cereal orops have ripened rapidly, and harvesting is now general.    Good second orops of seeds are reported, and potatoes continue to look well.Roots   are again suffering from the drought, and pastures are btfown and &quot;bare.    In some districts there is a  -shortage of keep and water for stock.Land Division.fl) Land Settlement.The Land Settlement (facilities) Bill having reoeived Royal Assent, the Board are issuing at once to all County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs a Circular Letter urging them to put into operation forthwith their extended powers to acquire  * land compulsorily and to obtain vacant possession of land acquired by agreement.    The desirability of obtaining early possession of parts of properties intended to be used as sites for dwelling houses is beii^ specially emphasized.With a view to reducing, so far a3 possible, the demands on the Exchequer in respect of purchases for oash, Councils are being asked to arrange wherever possible to make use of their new powers of hiring land compulsorily, and also in all suitable oasaa to purchase land for an annuity instead of for cash.Applications for Small Holdings.

This land was originally purchased ty tho County Council at auction for the sum of  1,220, but the Board have arranged to take over the purchase so that the land may be managed as a part of the Settlement,     This purchase brings the total area of land administered by the Board up to 18,643 acres.Three additional ex-Service men havo commenced work during the week, bringing the total number of such men now at the Settlements up to 222, viz., 59 settlers, 131 probationers, and 32 men working as wage-earners.     In addition 24 men havo been accopted as probationers, but havo not yet commenced work.      Pour ex-officers have nov.   been accepted as probationers for Bosbury and will commence work during the present week.,   Nine set tiers &quot;&quot;have been accepted for Kilmington by the County Council, who are managing this Settlement on behalf of the Board , andwill take up t^heir holdings at Michaelmas next *A scheme for the development of tho \7antago Parm Settlement, of which possession will be obtained&quot;&quot;at Michaelmas, has been sent to tho Treasury,     It is proposed to devote this Settlement to ex-officers and also, as dairying will be the typo of farming adopted, to accept as settlers a few women.     The Settlement will be worked as one largo farm on the profit-sharing system.     Arrangements havo been made to select a number of officers and Land Army women ready to commence work at Michaelmas, The Office of \/orks havo been asked to erect two Army Huts at once to servo as a hostel for some of the officers.    Tho women will be accommodated in one of tho existing farmhouses.The reports received from tho Directors show that harvest has commenced at all Settlements, except Patrington, where it is expected to begin about the end of the present week,&quot;  A number of Army Huts have been purchased at local sales for Patringt on during tho week to serve as store houses, etc.   At .HoJ^beach the Board1s horses and binders have commenced cutting oats for some of tho settlers.    All tlie flax crop has nov/   been pulled.   Particulars of the yield of oats grown at the Heath Hill Settlement on pasture broken up in the spring of 1918 are&quot;nov/ availablee     In all, five fields, totalling 57 acres, were broken up and the total yield was 521 quarters, i.o, 9.14 quarters cr 73 bushels per aero. This excellent result shows clearly the agricultural possibilities 0^ ^ho Heath Hill estate     These fields are this year croppod with who at and look like yielding well.   Hay- making at Rolleston has now practically finished and winter oats are being cut.     The hay crop on the whole hasturned out to be about an average crop.    Tho hay harvest is also nearly complete at Pembrey and ton acres of oats havo boon cut.    Harvest work is proceeding very satisfactorily at Amcsburyo     The potatoes, however, want rain badly,     The wool has been sold by auction during tho week for 2/7d per lb. and also 50 tons of potatoes for  9 a ton.     At Bos^ury  marketing of the fruit crop has commenced.    The orchardlTvvero put up to auction during tho week at tho ordinary annual hard-fruit sale, but the reserve price was not&apos; met , so were not sold.(ii)   \/ork of the Agricultural iSxocutivc Committees.Bntry on Land.    An interesting example of enterprise on the part of an ex-Service  man has occurred in Somerset.   THb A.i&apos;J.0. have been authorised by the Board to take possession of about an aero of derelict orchard and garden j and at port: chcad for the purpose of lotting tho land to an ex-coldierr    The j&amp;cecutivo
J. 3Officer reports that the substantially built house has been allowed to become a total wreck, and the productive orchard and wellHsrfcooked garden have become an overgrown thicket.  The tenant is prepared to pay a rent of  20 per annum for the garden and orchard, and at hia own. expense to fence the house off from the portion of the premises entered upon by the Committee.   The tenant has been warned that, owing to the limited period during whioh the A.B.C. may remain in possession, he will have no security  of tenure, such as a tenant is entitled to expect if he is to be sure of reaping the reward of his labour in bringing derelict land into cultivation. The Board have been informedt however, that he fully understands tho position and is satisfied as to the amount of benefit he is likely to reoeivo from the occupation of the land.   The tenant will depend for his living on the produce of the holding to the extent of one-fifth.Withdrawal from Lands,   On the Uth April, 1918, the Oxford 1.3,C* entered on, ploughed and sowed with wheat a 20-aore pasture field at Houndhill, Kandborough, owned and occupied by tho Duke of Marlborough.   The Duke stated that as he had neither horses nor labour to undertake the work, he considered that the Committee should oarry cut all cultivations and harvesting of the crop.   In October, 1918, the Committee informed tho Luke that they were willing to withdraw from the possession of tho land in question, provided he would undertake to keep the land in cultivation for the duration of the war.  In reply His Grace sent a long latter to the Committee, purporting to show that the Committeefs action has resulted in financial loss, and that the conversion from pasture to arable was not Justified,   as the Duke did not say whether he wished the Committee to withdraw, tho Committee deoided to remain in possession for another year.   She committee now propose to with-draw from possession as soon as the crop of oats now growing has boon harvested.  The field has been relaid to grass, and there is apparently a good plant of seeds.in November, 1917, the PorbyBbire A.E.C. * vwere authorised to take possession of about 4 acres of land in parish of Braaston.  The land was oovorad with *a very thick growth of privot from whioh rabbits caused great damage to crops on the adjoining land.   It was estimated that the cost of clearing the land end exterminating the rabbits would be 27o.  This estimate, however, was considerably exceeded, and the actual cost of the work proved to be  180.  The $jgaoutive Committee recently arranged with the owner that they would withdraw from possession, but claimed the sum of  250 as representing the value to the owner of their improvements, their contention being that not only had this worthless land been given a considerable agricultural value, but the value of the adjoining lands had bean greatly increased.  The owner disputed the claim and offered  125.  The matter went to arbitration, and the arbitrator has awarded the sum of  148.5.0* in respect of the improvements.   This amount has been paid and the Committee have withdrawn from possession,Prosecution for failure to out Thistles. A market gardener and farmer at Swans combe, gent&quot;, has beerf convicted and fined  20 and cost, for failing to comply wTEK an Order of the A.I3.C. to clear 15 acres of land covered with thistles whioh were about to seed.   The farmer in question was ordered last year to plough the land, and since doin?. so he had let it go derelict.  Evidence was given that about 10 acres of the land were literally a forest of thistles, some of whioh were over 5 feet high.   An inspection of the land has been made since the Court proceedings, and the cutting of the thistles has now commenced; and if it is completed forthwith it is proposed to take no    further action.(iii) Provision of Allotments.Withdrawal from lands/ entered u?oa under pmO^A^S^^^^fr being constantly urged V owners to wiraorawfrom land at present   4
Jbaing- used as,ullxrbmerrts.   During the war period many of the uses to which land-can&apos;&quot;be put such as building, recreation and advertising, were greatly restricted, consequently there was loss difficulty than there otherwise would have&apos;been in securing land for allotments. With tho cessation   of hostilities the position&quot;completely changed, and owners are now frequently in a position to prove that they are suffering substantial loss by being prevented fro;a resuming the control of their land. These cases present very serious difficulties from the point of view of the Board,   On the one hand, the Board aro responsible for the production of food.which is still of immense importance, and they are also anxious to sea that no injustice is clone to allotment holders, many of whom have not been in possession of their plots for more than two seasons and consequently have, in many cases, not secured any substantial advantage &quot;from their labour and expenditure.   Cn the other hand, the Board recognise that in view of the urgent demand for the increased provision of dwelling-houses, the cultivation of allotments cannot be allowed to delay the operations of the housing scheme. The Board are also bound not to continue to hold land for allotments if thereby the Lxochequer is involved an claims for compensation far heavier than the value of the food produced.r    IjSach case as it arises needs to bo considered on its merits, I but ^reat pressure is beiirv brought to bear on the Board both in Parliament and in the Press, with a view to preventing any land now cultivated as allotments being diverted to any other use.   Tho Board cannot endorse this extreme policy, but they are taking every possible step to prevent (or, where this is impossible, to postpone) the disturbance of allotment holders except in cases where the result of remaining in occupation would involve the Board in heavy damages.(iv) Tithe,Commons, Copyhold and Survey,The amount oi correspondence on matters affecting&quot; this Branch has diminished to some extent, as is usual during August, but the inquiries and applications received are still numerous.   89 applications for redemption of tithe rentcharge, involving a total of   ,  3&amp;0, have been received during the week.There are indications that tho provisions of the recent Act for the r edemption of tithe, rente barge by means of an annuity are receiving more general attention.   One enquiry has been made (verbally)? as regards the redemption by this means of tithe jrentcharges amounting to upwards of  9CC*   A question has also arisen on an &quot;annuity redemption&quot; in progress whether the lands concerned are bong developed ; as a building estate, as it appears very undesirable to charge such lands with an annuity which can be recovered, like tithe rentcharge, cut oi any part of the land charged, and for the redemption of which there is no statutory provision.   Great care will have to be exercised 1 to avoid the accidental infliction of hardships on small owners in such cases tThe provisional Order Sill for the Regulation of Coity ftallia Commons, Glamorganshire, having received the Royal Assent on the 15th inst., steps are being taken to convene a Meeting for the appointment of a Valuer for the purpose of an Award of Regulation being made in pursuance thereof..An order of K^nhange under tho Inolosure Acts was sealed on the 18th inst., by which 8-jjf perches on each side were exchanged between] the Corporation of Llauelly, Carmarthenshire, and the Great Western Railway Company for the purpose of enabling the formation of a roadway,J 35 feet wide, to give, inter alia, direct communication between the Corporation $state, the Railways and Docks,

The Small Holdings Committee of the Hast Suffolk Scanty Council have established a Building Works Department on the same lines as in West Suffolk, reported last week.Plans Approved.    During the past week plans for equipment have been formally passed, after the submission of the working drawings, specifications and contract terms, in the following cases:-Estimate Description Provisional Appro-wed of equipment   460 yards 130 130FencingPurchase, removal, re-erection and adaptation of Army Huts into tempv. housing accommodation.12 Huts at  2fi5 3180Sulphate of Ammonia.   The production of Sulphate of Ammonia in the first two months of the current fertiliser year has amounted to 55,600 tons of which 19,500 tons have been supplied for agriculture, and 27,000 tons have been exported. The quantity sold for forward delivery for agricultural purposes up to the end of September is 27,300 tons.Superphosphate.   Representations have beenjfiade to the Shipping&quot;Controller with a view to the provision of shipping space for the transport of attfut 130,000 tons of Phosphate Rock from North America during the next six tv seven months.     If this can be arranged there seems every prospect of the total supply of Phosphate Rock and consequently of Superphosphate in the current season being about the same as last year.    Repre-aentations are also being made to the ITrench Government with a view to securing the allocation in 1920 of at least as much Phosphate Rock aB was allotted for delivery in 1919 from the Frencfc Mines in North Africa.     The production of these Mines has decreased and the demands of France and of other Furopean countries are so great that there is some danger that the French Government may be tempted to reduce the quantity allotted to be exported to this country.County     ParishEnglandIsle of Ely.East SuffolkArea being equippedAcresWhittlesea     185Copdook  state
1&apos;otash    The arrangements for tho sale of the German Potash acquired by the Government from Germany in exchange for food have now been settled &quot;by the Board of Yrade.    The sale will be under-taken by the British Potash Company under the direction of an Official Committee, on which the Board of trade and the three Departments of Agriculture will be represented I together with Trade interests.    The roaximum prices, subject to the usual trade discounts, for sales to farmers, delivered to nearest railway station in lots of not less than 4 tons, will &quot;be - Potash Salts (30$) 212.10;   Iluriate of Potash (30$) e20.12s.6d;   Sulphate of Potash 523.2.6d per ton.    The total quantity for sale is 40,000 tone, delivery of which will be completed before the end of the year.    In addition a&quot;bout 20,000 tons or more of 14  or 20% Potash will be available for importation from Alsace Iorraine.Feeding.Stuffs.    The imports of Maize during the current year have been very low, the aggregate for seven months only amounting to about 400,000 tons, as compared with an estimated importation of a million tons in the twelve months.    The itinistry of Food have, however, now arranged with the \heat Commission for Maize to be imported into this country at a greatly increased rate during the remainder of the year.    This will relieve the shortage in this feeding stuff.Prospects of the supply of oil cake have somewhat improved and although the supply will be below the pre-war level it is likely to reach 1,100,000 tons, which is about 350,000 tons more than last year, and as much as was imported in the years 193,1 and 1912.Marketing of Fruit and Vegetables.    An investigation is now being conducted by the Division into the methods of marketing fruit and vegetables in Sngland and Talesj particularly with reference to the sale of produce by smallholders.    In view cf the large number of small holdings which are now being set up it is very necessary to see that the opportunities enjoyed by small holders for selling their produce are satisfactory or, if not, whether they can be remedied.Transport.    A provisional arrangement has now been come to whereby requests for new or improved rail transport facilities will be referred by the Ministry of ^ays and Communications tc the Board.    The Boafd will make a preliminary -investigation with a view to ascertaining the desirability of the proposal from an agricultural point of view and will furnish the Ministry of &quot;&apos;aye ^&apos;ith a report on the subject.    If the Board recommend the proposal on the prima facie evidence, the Ministry will examine the project with a view to ascertaining whether it is commercially feasible.    If the result of their investigations is satisfactory they will take the necessary steps to give effect to it;    if on the other hand, it is considered that the project is not likely to pay its way, it will be for the Board to consider whether the proposal is sufficiently important in the national interest to make it desirable to press the matter further.Technical and Cultivation Division.Tractor Section.    During the week ended the 1st August, 1192 tractors were in the hands of Committees and 843 of these were being operated under the Hew Tractor Scheme.    349 tractors were operated by Committees directly and of these 139 or 40?..&apos; were in commission and were idle 2% of the time on account of bad weather.    No work was available for 93 tractors and 117a.
tractors wore under repair.    A large proportion of the tractorsare awaiting harvest work.    The returns received showed that 2117 acres urere ploughed and 1845 acres were cultivated by 366 I    tractors under both schemes, giving an average of 5.78 and 5,04acres respectively.    In addition, 382 acres were reaped by tractor-hauled binders in 10 counties where harvesting operations commenced during the week.l&apos;he highest average acreage was recorded in Durham where three tractors ploughed 35 acres, average 11.7 acres, but the most work was done in Warwickshire where 24 tractors ploughed 184 acres and cultivated 204 acres;   average 7.7 acres and 8.5 acres respectively.Repuirementsrand Disposal Section.

^Education Branch *Higher &quot;Education and Technical Committee Section.    Setimatea for Research and Advisory&quot;work during the year beginning 1st October next are now being received and considered.In this connection it may be mentioned that it has been decided on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee in Agricultural Science, that soil surveys undertaken in England and Wales should be regarded as a branch of Advisory Work to be aided by the Development Grants set aside for this purpose.    Agrioul-tural Colleges which had applied for Special Research Grants in aid of soil surveys have therefore been advised to include provision for such work in their Advisory Estimates, up to a maximum of 2500 per annum.fipunty Agricultural Education.    Schemes from local Authorities to which general approval has been given include a comprehensive scheme submitted by the &quot;Essex Education Committee, which, if carried into effect, will involve the transference of the Hast Anglian Institute of Agriculture from Chelmsford to a more suitable site in the County, and the establishment of two &quot;type&quot; demonstration farms.    At present considerable inconvenience arises from the fact that the existing farm is situated more than 3 miles from the Institute.Approval has been given to the purchase of Kingsham Farm, Chichesterj by the West Sussex County Council, for the purpose of a Farm Institute.    Definite proposals and estimates of the cost of providing an Institute have been received from the Holland Division of Lincolnshire.Dairy Branch.Encouragement, of tCheesemakirigit Scheme.

The Treasury have authorised * 50 grants, up to TIM each - with additional ^ifo and children&apos;s allowances to married men - for the training overseas of candidates who propose to settle abroad, in addition to the extension of overseas training for approved candidates who have received part of their training in Great Britain.On the recommendation of the 0.A.&apos;C Sub-Committee, it has been decided that the training overseas must be undertaken either by, or under the auspices of a recognised Agricultural *Institution, or under the immediate supervision of the Department of Agriculture of the Colony or other Government concerned. Individual applications for overseas training must also bo recommended by the Imperial ?4ducation Committee, on which the various Colonies etc., are represented.2. Training of lien.Disabled Hen.- Training Allowances.   Following on the Ministry of Pensions: decision to increase the disability pensions scale for disabled men, the Ministries of labour and Pensions have decided that whilst a disabled man is in training he shall receive the maximum disability pensions scale which will be substituted for the tvo existing scales of training allowances at present in force,    It is probable that the Board will be compelled to follow the same procedure in the case of disabled men who are being, or will be, trained in agriculture.    riiis point is under consideration the cjtango in the scale of training allowances will add greatly to the vork of the Training Branch and of the Agricultural Executive Committees.ITumber .of Disabled ma in training, and estimate of probable demand f or *&quot;agrrpulTu?al training .    &apos;./hen the Board too&quot;k over&quot;&quot;Trom the Ministry of&quot; tensions &quot;uhe responsibility of training disabled men in agriculture, they could obtain no particulars of the numbers in training.

Mr. Rees, of the Agricultural Sducation        -Department7 has been interviewed with regard to the formation of a Horticultural Sub-Ccmmittee. and it was ascertained that the Board1s proposals are generally viewed with favour.    Mr. Claude Taompeoo, an influential gentleman in the county, was also interviewbd, and stated his opinion that they already had an approved system of horticultural instruction, but at the same time he was*favourable to the establishment of Training Institutes, and Demonstration Plots, and the co-option Of members to secure a strong horticultural committee.     He promised to give these matters his attention.Worcestershire.

A further course of instruction was commenced in the Canning Kitchen, on the il-th inst.    Amongst the students is included a lady representative of the National Union of South Africa.Plant Diseases Section.Wart Disease,     Outbreaks of this disease have been reported ^urTng&quot; this week from Lancashire, Cheshire, North Waies and Shropshire,     Three fresh cases have avlso been discovered in the Southern and Home Counties.     Inspectors are making a systematic inspection of the crops in the principal potato growing districts.The summer Inspection of the Ormskirk Potato Trials was held on   August 12th, 13th and 14th.     The objects of these  rials, which have been conducted by the Board for several years, are to determine which of the varieties already in comifterce and which new varieties are immune to Wart Disease, and to demonstrate the cropping qualities of immune varieties.     Several hundred visitors, including potato growers and merchants, members and officials of the Agricultural and Horticultural Committees and the Agricultural Colleges throughout &quot;she country, and officials of the Board, were conducted over the Trial Grounds by Mr. J. Snell, who explained the experiments in progress.     Advantage was taken of the presence of so many people interested in potato growing to discuss the problems v/hich have arisen in connection with Wart Disease, and very valuable discussions took place at the evening gatherings.Poj^itq^Uj^Jt.     The outbreak of Potato Blight in Denbighshire &quot;previously noted has new become rather severe, though confined to a small area, and a few very slight outbreaks have been reported from other districts,     The recent dry, hot weather has doubtless checked the development of this disease.Dodder on Onions,     A further case of Dodder on Onions is reported &quot;from cfaTdiff.     The subject is receiving attention.Wireworms.     A bad attack of wirev/information on potatoes has occurred&quot; fii Cheshire.     It appears that the attack is due to local conditions, as crops    -grown on adjoining land from seed from the same consignment are looking extremely well.Labour Division.De^obili2atipn,     The number of men described as agriculturists demobilized during the seven day3 ended 13th August was 1,084, ..making the total demobilized to that date 243,352.Assistance of Soldiers for Haymaking and Harvest.     An instruction dated 12th August has been issued by the War Office to all Home Commands, under which Commanding Officers are authorised to grant seven days leave for haymaking and harvest.     This leave may be extended at the discretion of Officers Commanding Units,     xen on Home Service are alone affected.
HiA further instruction by the 7ar Office sanctioned the employment of soldiers on harvest work in the locality in which they are stationed, provided their military duties are not interfered with, and that civilian labour is not available.     This last concession may not promise much effective help.     One reason is that units are now more concentrated in limited aiease within each Command, and axe not, as during the war at this time of the year, widely distributed throughout the rural districts.The many skilled men serving with the Colours in France, and on the Rhine, are not mads available, nor may those who are home on leave obtain any extension of furlough for agricultural purposes.     It is, however, understood that British units in Germany are permitted to help save the harvest in the Rhine provinces.Women jb Branch.There continues to be a steady demand for skilled workers, and reports show that they retain their posts satisfactorily.     Unfortunately very few either skilled or unskilled women workers are available.     Large numbers of women are still engaged on flan pulling in the Eastern Counties.    Demands are coming in for women for the potato harvest.Five scholarships worth  12 and providing both maintenance and tuition have been awarded by the Education Committee for Warwickshire to Land Army girls, who will thus be enabled to take a 6 weeks&apos; dairy course at the Kingston Agricultural and Dairy College,     Five girls have been s&amp;ected as suitable for this opportunity.Arrangements are being made for securing a further number of milking trainings, but the difficulties are s.msiderable as the farmers who during the war were willing to train women for the sake of the country are no longer able to do so, while the opportunities for such trainings offered by the Local Education Authorities are very limited.The party of four recently appointed to visit the Cercles Fermieres and  coles Menageres Agricoles in Belgium have returned after a very interesting lo days spent in that country.    ilvery facility wag offered to the party by the Department of Agriculture in Brussels,Women1 s Institutes,     The educational value of the Women&apos;s Institutes has &quot;&quot;been lecogniscd in Ssaex where the County Federation has been given &amp;. grant of  100 from the County Education Committee,The Shropshire Institutes are taking up the question of bee-keeping and thus going ahead of the Local Education Committee, from which body.they fail to receive any offial help in the matter,Six new Institutes were started during the week, making a total of 1,182,
I&apos;1351 PART II.     OTH&quot;R DIVISIONS.Animals Division.There have been 52 outbreaks of Swine Fever and 225 reports of suspected oases.The number of reports of suspected cases of Rabies has boen 22, and 3 fresh outbreaks have been confirmed, namely one in each of the counties of Glamorgan, Brecon and jflssex.    The Brecon case necessitated an extension Of the iionmouth - Glamorgan control district, and the :i!ssex outbreak the establishment of a new control distriot taking in south-east Essex and a part of Suffolk.    No evidence as to the origin of the Essex case has so fax been obtained *Another outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease was confirmed at Hurley, Warwickshire, in close proximity to those already declared.Rats Branch.At the recent Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute held at Newcastle, 28th July till 2nd August, a considerable amount of attention was paid to the Rat Problem.    Papers were read on (l) Zoology of Rats and Mice with special reference to the control of the Rat population, (2) Pleas found on Rats and their relation to plague, (3) The Rat as a carrier of diseases trans-mittable to men and to other lower animals, (4) The Rat problem and repressive measures.    The medical Officers of the Ports of Hull, London, Hartlepool, Manchester and Liverpool took part in the discussions, and as a result the following resolution was passed:-&quot;Thatthe Council of the Royal Sanitary Institute be recommended to urge upon the Minister of Health the nece8Sity of continuing, as a health measure, the powers conferred under the Rats Order, and that support be given to the Bill dealing with Rat Destruction now before Parliament.&quot;In connection with the Rat exhibition and the series of teats of various methods of rat destruction carried out by the Zoological Society in connection with the Board of Agricultuie and Fisheries, Mr. &quot;3.G.. Boulenger, F.ii.S. will deliver a lecture in the Lecture Room of the Zoological Gardens offices, Regents Park, London, at 12 o?clock (mid-day) on September 26th on rat destruo-tion.    The lecture will probably be followed by a demonstration in the afternoon;   and it is hoped that Medical Officers of Health, Sanitary Officers, Officials appointed by Local Authorities in connection with the administration of the Rats Orders 1918-1919, and others interested in the subject will be able to attend.Veterinary Department.Swine fever material was examined in 80 reported outbreaks.

The Motor Loan Oomraittoe are much gratified&quot; to &apos;5o aeleTTo report the complete success of the first Motor Beaching Coble.     It has new been running for about four months.    A visit of inspection has boon paid during the present month to i?lamborough for the purpose of looking into the condition of ths engine&apos; and completing the instruction for the fishermen.     It was&quot; found that notwithstanding the fact that tho engine has not yet been taken over by tho men on loan,   and is therefore Sovsrnmont property, it had beenbeautifully kept.    Tho^fishermen reported that they had not been held up for a single day pa account:of the engine, and they have reported to another fisherman at   a neighbouring pert, who has made an application for an engine for his coble that they do not think a bettor engine could bo found.
Ab ohowing the success of the motor coble, it ia interesting to note that a third&apos;member of the crew lately decided to sell his share end on this information being made public, other men clamoured to take up th* ahare, with the result that the other members of the crew were able to choose a man whom they considered to be one of the best in the port.Another coblo is now Bearing completion, and it is hoped that the engine will be installed towards the end of September.1The Motor Loan Committee feel that the movement towardB the building of now &quot;and larger motor boats vat Flamborough is important, for it will in time lead to a piactical reconstmotion of the FleettThe special arrangement made at Flamborough was that the men should have the engine free for six months after which period if it proved a success, they   ushowld take it over on the usual loan terms, but, if the experiment was found to be a failure, the engine should be taken out and the vessel reconditioned, free of charge.General Division.Flax Production Branch.Excellent progress haB been made in harvest operations in all Centres.
