It was decided to appoint three sub-committees:-. (i)   To consider and advise on the initial rents to be. charged&apos; by local authorities for houses built under the Government scheme in rural areas,&apos; and on any conditions to be included in the terms of tenancy, with the object&apos; of securing an approximation to an economic rent at the earliest practicable date?.fit) To consider and advise on the subjects with regard to which women may usefully give advice to local authorities in connection&apos; with their housing schemes and the machinery by which the local authority can best obtain such advice.(ill) To consider and advise on the principles to be followed in dealing with slum areaeincluding the circumstances in which schemes of reconstruction, as distinct from clearance, may be adopted, and, as regards clearances, the extent to which rehousing on the, site should be required, the kind of housing which should be permitted, and the use of the site for factory or other purposes than houses.
The four Sub-Committees previously&apos; appointed (Finance, Standardisation, and Use of new methods and &apos; materials., Contract and Schedule of prices, and Speoi-disqualification&apos; ) have continued to meet during the month.

Luring the four weeks&quot; ended 26th July, 894 sites were &quot;submitted by Local Authorities and public Utility Societies for the ministry&apos;s approval, mailing a total of 3,596 (exclusivet of a number of sites which had been with-drawn or had been rejected as unsuitable or for other reasons). The total area comprised in these sites was about 40,000 acres which would provide roughly for some 400,000 houses.   The number of sites approved was 1,037, covering about 15,000 acres.The total number of applications up to the  6th July for&apos; approval of lay-outs was 569, of whioh the Ministry had approved 250.Up to July 26th house-plans for 81,587 houses in.all had been submitted and of these the Ministry-:had given approval for 12,672 houses.II.Ministry of Health Act.

(2) Influenza.      Reports were submitted during the month dealing v/ITffTEe fncidence of influenza on various classes of chemical workers in Widnes and Runcorn.   Further reports are being prepared with regard to similar enquiries in Warring-ton and South&quot;Shields.If^y&amp;S3.-     During the month, 56 cases of Smallpox were reported.&quot; Bix of these occurred in London,.viz. in Bethnal Green, 1; Stepney, 1 and Woolwich 4.

Two cases.were military cases in the Whitohurch Rural District (Salop).   Three ship-borne cases were landed at Dover&apos; (Deal Division) Liverpool and Manchester respectively.   The cases which occurred&quot;at Lowestoft, Beccles, Bungay and Loddon and Clavering are grouped cases,   The infection was introduced in the month of May by a&apos; sailer, the nature&quot; of whose illness was hot at first recognised.   The disease presents some aberrant features on which a report is being prepared. AS regards the military cases, one was a soldier who returned from Alexandria and died of haemorrhagio smallpox and the other was a nurse who nursed him.The Government Lymph Establishment had a stock of 1,252,000 tubes of lymph in hand at. the end of the month, 73,293 .tubeB of vaccine lymph have been issued during the 5 weeks ended 30th July.(4) Rabies,      17 cases of persons bitten by suspected animals werlTTcalt with as they occurred, 11 in and about London and 6 in South Wales.(5) Malaria;-   In collaboration with the Medical De-partments of the&quot; Navy, Army and Air Force, notes oh the malaria position in England and Wales have been prepared and circulated each week to the different departments, com-mittees&quot; and officials concerned with this subject.   Complete enquiries into indigenous malaria in the County of Essex and the Islands of Sheppey and Grain were made and reported on;&apos; and steps to deal systematically with the indigenous disease in Sheppey and Grain are being taken in consultation with the local authorities concerned.   The Ministry have requested the Air Ministry to ask the Medical Officer of the Air Station in the Isle of Grain to assist in the treatment of cases and in any necessary preventive measures.   Visits of enquiry were also made in various areas in which cases of suspected in-digonous malaria had been reported, and laboratory work, which includes the examination,Of specimens on behalf of the Scottish Board of Health, has been continued.(6) Hague.    A Medical Officer of the Ministry made detailed Investigation concerning a fatal case of bubonic plague in Liverpool.   The patient, a Master Stevedore and bargeman was removed to the Isolation Hospital on the 11th July and died oil the 19th, but bacteriological confirmation of the fact that he was suffering from plague was not obtained until the 26th July.   Ho further cases have occurred.   Dead rats have been  &apos; discovered in the patient&apos;s office and in the adjacent premises, but on examination*.none were ascertained to have plague.   A $ mouse &quot;found dead has been proved by bacteriological examination to have suffered from plague.   The Corporation have undertaken the disinfection of the premises&apos;and the destruction and ex-ami nation of rodents found in them.
On the arrival of the S.8. &quot;Framlington Court&apos;1 at Avonmouth from Montreal on the 22nd July one of her officers who was ill was removed to the isolation hospital&apos; and has been certified, to be suffering from.bubonic plague.   Another officer with suspicious symptons was taken to hospital the following&apos; day and he is also suffering from the disease. The vessel came from Alexandria to Montreal and called at Sydney, . Bfova Scotia, on her voyage to Avonmouth.   She is being detained by the Bristol Port Sanitary Authority and all precautions have been taken.   The circumstances of these oases at Avon-mouth and Liverpool are being fully-investigated,, Luring the month of July two instances have&apos; occurred, in which plague has broken out among persons on vessels (.8,3. &quot;Nankin&quot; and S.S. &quot;Mooran) outward bound from England.   Such an occurrence is practically unique and has been under special investigation.&apos; &apos;(rO Venereal Diseases.     Two more Main Treatment Centres for venereaT^dlseaseTwere opened during the month, making a total &quot;of 150.   The number of auxiliary Centres is now 76, and 15 other institutions are in use for the treatment of special classes of women and girls suffering from these diseases. Considerable difficulties are being experienced in certain areas in the provision of farther treatment centres owing to the lack of accommodation which could be adapted for this purpose.(8) Tuber culo sis *   The number cf bods for the treatment of tuboroulbsisTn&apos; institutions approved by the Ministry has increased during the month by 301 to a total of 14,395. Luring the four weeks ended the 25th July, 1919, 655 cases of discharged service men suffering from tuberculosis have been notified to the Ministry as having been admitted by English Insurance Committees to sanatoria and&apos; other residential &quot;institutions under the special arrangements for the prefer-ential treatment of these men.(9) National Health Insurance.   The National Health In-surahce Bill,        ,&apos;has passVd &quot;trough all its stages in the. House of Commons without amendment, and has&apos; passed the second reading and the Committee stage in the House of Lords.   The object of&apos; the Bill is to prevent a large number of non-manual workers being forced out of insurance by the general rise of wages.   Under the 1911 Act persons employed by way of manual labour are required to be insured without reference to their rate of remuneration.   Non-manual workers&quot;, however, are only required to be insured if their rate of remuneration does not exceed  160 a year.   The Bill proposes to substitute  250 for the,previous limit &quot;( 160) as affording the closest possible approximation to the extent to which wages have risen in the case of the classes of non-manual workers affected.(10) Maternity and Child Welfare.   On the 14th July the Ministry is sued&quot;&quot; a circular &quot;invfting iThe attention of local authorities and others,concerned in maternity, child welfare and other departments of public health to the important regu-lations&quot; just made by the Board of Education, after consultation with the Ministry, for the &quot;payment from that Board of grants in aid of the training of women to become Health Visitors,   The circular strongly emphasises&apos; the necessity of securing that so far as practicable only those women should be appointed to salaried posts for the important functions comprised in health visiting who possess a good general education followed by an efficient course of special training in an institution approved by the Board of Education.   The circular also urges that all supervising authorities under the Midwives Act who have not al-rea&amp;y done so should, as soon as possible, appoint on their staff a woman Medical Officer to supervise maternity and child welfare work and to inspect midwives under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health.
The Ministry have also issued a circular informing local authorities that the Treasury have sanctioned an amendment of the regulations which will enable the Ministry in the present and future financial years to pay grants on account.During the past month approval has been given to proposals by 52 local authorities and 4 voluntary agencies for extending their schemes of maternity and child welfare. In seven of these cases the extensions include&apos; the acquisi-tion of premises for convalescent homes, creches and maternity and child welfare centres and in three cases loans amounting to  2,460 were, sanctionedo&apos; During the month the number of health visitors, has increased by 26., and the number of centres by 11,   On the 31 st   of Ju.ly, 19,there were 883 municipal and 675 voluntary centres;   local authorities employed 873 whole time and&quot; 877 part time health visitors;   voluntary societies employed 333 health visitors;   1120 district nurses were also employed as part time health visitors by local authorities who make payment to the Nursing Associations.(11) League of Nations and International Health.   Various conferences havoTJeen heTd on iHis suo&quot;&quot;Jec&quot;t,&quot;including one con-venedby the Minister on July 29th and 30th and attended by representatives of the League of Bed Gross Societies and the Officer International d&apos;Hygiene Publique.(12) Indian Port Sanitary Administration.   A deputation from India was received &quot;to dlsouss&quot;Tinerquestfon of the intro-. duction of certain changes in Indian port sanitary administra-tion.III.   GEKFRAI.(1) Public Works.     During-the month 295 applications by local authorities for sanction to loans have been received as compared with 228 during June.   Included among those applica-tions is one from the County Council of the West Riding of Yorkshire for sanction to borrow  316,000 for the purchase of land in various parishes for the settlement of ex-service men.   The total amount of the loans sanctioned during the month was  1,166,314 as, against  554,153 during; June.   The principal purposes for which loans were sanctioned during July were electricity undertakings, land settlement of ex-service men (accounting for about two-fifths and one-fifth of the total respectively) water supply, street improvements, sewerag works and schools.(2) Land Settlement.   During the month consent has been given to the Sorrovong: Ty the County Councils of Cambridge, Devon, Hint, Herts, Middlesex, Somerset, Worcester and the last Riding and North Riding of Yorkshire of loans amounting -to  247,024 for the purchase of 28 estates having a total area of about 5,800 acres for the land settlement of ex-service men.   As compared with last month this shows an increase of  177,653 in the amount sanctioned and over 5,000 acres in the area to be acquired.
(5) Vina^Q I^llB,      The question has been raised in Par 1 iamenCllTl^lST7e7Iditur e by Parish&apos; Councils upon the provision of village halls0   Parish Councils have no power to provj.de village halls as such, but they are authorised by section.8 of the Local Government Act, 1894, to provide buildings for the transaction of parish business which may also be used for purposes of recreation and they may be authorised to borrow money for the purpose-   These powers may also be conferred upon Parish Meetings and urban District , Councils,   If the Public Libraries Acts are adopted erpen&amp;l-ture may be incurred in fitting up reading rooms in such buildings and in providing newspapers and other literature.(4) National Salvage,   During&apos; the month Mr, Jn 0, Dawes was appointed to^lSeTEngineering Department as Public Cleansing and Salvage Inspector.   This appointment is a new departure . and has been made in consequence of the Ministry having under-taken the work of the National Salvage Council so far as it affects Local Authorities.   Mr. Dawes was formerly Assistant Director of the National Salvage Council.   The Inspector will visit Local Authorities&apos; Districts and will investigate and advise the Ministry upon all matters appertaining to the salvage and utilisation of valuable material, contained&quot;&apos;in house and other refuse, which has, to a great extent, been wasted in the past,(5) Municipal Elections,    A memorandum as to the elec-tion of members&apos;of local authorities was submitted to the War Cabinet by the Minister on the 9th July.(6) legal Kiectiqns (Proportional Representatlonj^Bill. amendments to tliis^Bili&apos;, whi&quot;cnwe e &quot;prepared by&quot; tile&quot;parlfa-mentary Counsel in consultation with Officers of the Ministry and a representative of the ^Proportional Representation Society, were moved in&apos; Committee by Viscount Peel on behalf of the Ministry, and were accepted&apos; without discussion.   The Bill has how been passed by the House of Lords,(&apos;?:) Compensation for Subsidence Bill.   The Minister attended the  standing Committee of&quot; the House of Commons&apos; upon this Bill, and informed the Committee that the Govern-ment considered that the Bill&apos; was not framed upon the right lines; that the scheme embodied in It was not a workable one; and that they were therefore not prepared to give it facilities nor to. support the necessary financial resolution; but that the Government would&quot; submit proposals to Parliament upon the Biattor as soon as they could.   The&apos; Committee adjourned the consideration&apos; of the Bill to a date to be fixed by the Chairman upon the request of the member in charge.The Ministry &quot;are eapowerea to&quot; extend the period of&quot;ope ration of the temporary provisions of these Acts&quot; (so far as regards Ingiand and Wales) for a period not exceeding one year&apos; after the termination of the war,, In View of this power, the Acts are not included in the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill. It is considered that most of the temporary provisions of the Acts should be continued for a year after the termination of the war, and an order la being prepared for this purpose1916 o
(9) Regiajrajion of piectors.    A Conference with party agents ana^repres^ntTi^ive TieglsTfation Officers has been held to consider various questions arising with respect to the registration of electors.    The principal matters discussed werej(I) A combined form of claims to be registered.   The lines upon which the form should be framed were agreed.fii) Methods for reducing the cost of printing the registers; &quot;The Conference oonsidered that it was not necessary that the electors lists should be printed in full as at present, and recommended that the lists as published should consist of (a) the existing register, with the names of persons who have ceased to be qualified struck out;   (b) a list of the names so struck out, and (c) a list of new names to be added.   The-register would be printed in full as at present.   They also recommended that the Register should cease to be made out in three separate divisions, but that all the names should appear in their proper street or other&apos; order, the qualifications being indicated by letters, as is done in the case of the register in Scotland.   It is considered that these changes would result in a material reduction in the cost ox printing the registers.(10) Issue ofJ3tock. An Order under the Stock Regulations was made by&quot;&apos;the&apos; MinistFy authorising the Birkenhead Corporation to issue  1,080,000 5fo stock.   The issue was made at a price of(II) Speeding up the Audit.     During the war the audit of the accounts of local&apos; authorities fell into arrear in spite of special efforts on the part of the District Auditors.   The delay was due to the following facts(i) A large proportion of the Government Audit Stadf were on Military service:(ii) Local authorities were slow in making up their account owing to their staffs being reduced;(iii) Additional work had been thrown on the Auditors in the audit of accounts of new &quot;bodies, such as Pood Control Committees.In view of the importance of the Government Audit being held promptly the Ministry have taken the exceptional course of instructing their Auditors to complete by a fixed date not only any outstanding audits but also all those for periods ended in 1919.   per this purpose it will be necessary to adopt special procedure.   By the beginning of the next financial&apos; year it is anticipated that the audit work will be up to date and that the auditors&apos; will be ready to deal with any new work which may be required from them, such as the audit of housing accounts,(IS) Payment of Members of Local Authorities. A, raemorand-um upon the &apos;&quot;sub jecTlTO^TsuToi^ on the21st July,
(13) War Bonuses.     The Ministry continue to urge upon local authorities*lirHse^Tmployees are dissatisfied with the action taken in regard to war bonuses, the desirability of submitting the matter to arbitration.   They have informed two councils that they do not consider they would be justified in sanctioning the payment of bonuses larger than those authorised by the Circular of the 20th May.(14) Appointments of ex-service men as officers of Local &quot;^^t^o^TtTesT&quot;&quot;&quot; The Ministry^oiitinuTTo support generally the claims of ex-service candidates for appointments as Medical Officers of Health, Sanitary Inspectors, and Inspectors of nuisances. Five of the twelve Medical Officers of Health appointed during the month had served in the forces, and of the thirteen Sanitary Inspectors and Inspectors of Nuisances appointed eight were ex-service men0(15) Welfare ,of the Blind,     Regulations have been approved and are abouT^tb:.^e^iasued- governing the distribution of the proposed grant in aid of the welfare of the Blind which was re-ferred to at page 7 of the report of the Local Government Board to the War Cabinet for the month of May, 1919.(16) Hational Kegistration.     A circular was issued to. Local RegisTfation Authorities on the 14th July, informing them that the Minister does not propose to take any steps to secure the continuance of the National Registration Acts, 1915 and 1918, beyond the date when they will otherwise expire, and suggesting that in the interests of immediate economy, all administrative operations under the Acts might be discontinued forthwith.(17) Relief of War Distress.   The grants made from the National Relief Fund upon&quot;the recommendation of the Government Committee during the month, were as follows:- To Local Representative Committee for the provision of direct assistance.......... 1,471To Local Representative Committees for the relief of air raid distress...........     103for the relief of distress among the professional classes.................. 9 ,420To the Canadian fund Committees for the re-equipment of lodging-house keepers ......     300Total      11,294following on the issue of the circular letter of the 27th June last to Local Representative Committees to which     * reference is made in the report for the month of June, a number--of cases have been reported to the Government Committee in which it is thought that assistance- will be required aftoY thes-31st July.   It has, however, been found impracbicable to make &apos; -the necessary arrangements to deal with such cases by that date and the Government Committee haVe accordingly obtained the con-currenoe of the Executive Committee of the National Relief fund in the request that the Local Representative Committees concerned should continue assistance in these cases until the end of August. The Local Representative Committees who have not reported any cases have been thanked for their services and have been requested to close their accounts and remit any balance remaining in hand on     * the 31st July.
(18).   Assistance to Aliens.     In accordance with the new arrangements re ferredTo in &quot;the&quot; Report&apos; for June, the Ministry, With the approval of the Treasury, have paid to the Government Secretary and Treasurer of the Isle of Mani, on the request of the Civilian Internment &apos; Camps Committee, a sum of  42,135 to adjust the position in regard to the funds for maintenance of the internment camps in the Island.   Tho Ministry have also written to the Committee in accordance with the authority given by the Treasury, agreeing to make periodical payments of specific sums, at the request of the&apos; Committee, for salaries and wages and for the maintenance of interned aliens.The Treasury authorised the repayment of moderate additional allowances given by Guardians to British-born wives of interned or repatriated aliens, and the dependants of Russians, during the week of the- itea*&amp;i Celebrations.War Refugees.     During the past month the Surplus Government Property Disposal Board were notified of property used in connection with the accommodation &amp;c. of the refugees which had become&quot; available for sale.   All &quot;this property, except some still in use by the Jewish War Refugees, has now become ready: if or disposal.The repatriation of refugees is now almost completed except for certain special cases, such as lunatics and other&apos; sick, who are being dealt with as rapidly as possible.   There remain, however, some 550 Jewish refugees maintained wholly or partly by Government assistance, whose repatriation constitutes a difficult problem, especially in view of the fact that many of them had not acquired the nationality of the country from which they came.   Many of them came from Belgium and Prance, others from Poland, Russia and Palestine.   A small number were in Belgium at the outbreak of war in transit to America and Canada, and are now desirous of proceeding there.   In many cases, the breadwinner is abroad, having joined the Russian &apos; Army Under the Anglo-Russian Military Service Convention. The&apos; problem of dealing with these refugees has been brought before the Aliens Nationality Committee, and correspondence has taken place with the Home Office, the Foreign Office, the Treasury and the Belgian Legation on the subject.   The consent of the Treasury to continue Government assistance to these people to the end of September next has been given, and the Ministry have also been empowered to defray the expenses of repatriating them0The Poland Street Refuge which has been used since 1914 for the accommodation of a considerable number of Jewish refugees will shortly be closed,   With the reduced numbers it is more economical to supply home assistance, and this will be given through the Jewish War Refugees Committee.   The Earls Court Camp has now been closed, and the building has been handed back to the owners,   One house of the Warwick Square Clothing Depot has been retained, via. No.23, Warwick Square.   It was held oil a lease which expires on the 11th instant, when the premises will be given up.   The surplus property will be re-moved by the Disposal Board on the 7th instant,The staff at Aldwyoh has been entirely dispersed ex-cept for two officials and one lady&apos; typist,   One of the officers will be retained till the end of the&apos; present month for the purpose of completing a report on the work cf the local commit-tees.   The other official, the Accounting Officer, must be re-tained till about the end of September to prepare the final accounts for audit.
The question of recovering from enemy countries the expenditure incurred by the Government&apos;on the maintenance &amp;c of the Belgian refugees on this country will come before the Treasury in connection with the Inter-Allied Reparation Committee,   The Ministry have taken the opportunity to notify the Treasury that in their view the expenditure should not be included in the British-claimtt   They have pointed out that it is not clear that the expenditure is covered by the terms of the treaty, that, apart from this, the expenditure has been treated from the outset as a free gift to the Belgian Nation; that the Belgian Government are aware of this and have expressed their gratitude for what this country has clone in the matter; and that as the claims of the Allied countries will be known to, and subject to criticism by, one another it would have a bad effect if the expenditure were included in the British Claim0(20. Military Occupation of Boor law Premises:,   The military auufibritles continue torelufnTTb poor law authorities poor law premises which have been occupied as military hospitals, Of an approximate total number of 75,000 poor lav/ beds so occupied approximately 39,400 had been vacated or were in course of vacation by the end cf July,(21) Cases^oi Delirium Tremens inJPoorJLaw Institutions, Returns received&quot; -from the poorTaw^auTfooFfEies ifi England and Wales, with the exception of 26 authorities who have not yet rendered a return, show that during the three months ended the 30th June last, 45 males and 10 females were admitted to poor law institutions suffering from clinically well defined delirium tremens, comparing with 35 males and 11 females as reported for the quarter ended 31st March last.
