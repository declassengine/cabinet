Following telegram received from Malleson, 29th August: 1. Evidence accumulated as to the intensive character of anti-British agitation now going on throughout Central Asia and Afghanistan, Largo number of leaflets and pamphlets printed in Moscow, Tashkent, Kabul, Askabad, and elsewhere are in circulation. I have copies of some of these, and will wire precis later on. Kazim Beg especially is active. He is said to have hundreds of trained agitators ready to let loose in Persia. Pie is doing his utmost to gain over Turcomans. To-day I hear from Herat that he has written to say that be will pay Governor brief visit shortly, and Governor is making arrangements for his reception. Doubtless, object is to stiffen up Western Afghanistan opinion against British. Hitherto this has been weak and most pure Heratis would probably sooner be under British than Kabul rule, and many in Meshed openly say so.2. Kabul leaflets reaching Herat are attempting to allay Sunni Shiah differences, pointing out that both are equally good Mohamedans, and that Afghans and Persians are practically one people, and should act together politically.3. Large numbers of Turcoman families (one report says 1,000) have crossed from Panjdeh district into Afghanistan, and have been well received. They complain of Bolshevic oppression. Governor has given them daily allowance of food and money, and more are being encouraged. Governor said to have written to Kabul asking for sanction to allot lands to Turcomans.4. Paragraph 1 above was repeated to Tehran by Malleson.
