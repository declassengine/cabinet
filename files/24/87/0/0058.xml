THE DISPOSAL OF ADMIRALTY OWED TRAWLERS AID &quot;DRIFTERS.Memorandum for the War.Cabinet by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I desire to submit for the decision of the Cabinet the Admiralty proposals,for the disposal of the Trawlers and Drifters built for use during, the war which are now surplus to naval requirements.The disposal of these vessels was one of the questions submitted to the Admiralty Reconstruction Committee appointed by the late First Lord in January 1918 under the chairmanship of Mr Pretyman * at that time Civil Lord.The present situation regarding these vessels is. as follows:-The total number built for the Admiralty wasTrawlers 449Drifters 227The lieconstruction Committee recommended that 100 Trawlers and 50 Drifters should be sold by tender, preference being given to ownerB who had lost vessels during the war in H.M. Service.   In a later report (of February 24th 1919) copy of which is attached the majority of the Committee recommended that of the remainder, 300 Trawlers and 150 Drifters should be reserved for disposal to a co-partnership society on terms which will be referred to hereafter- leaving a balance for Fleet purposes of 49 Trawlers and 27 Drifters,     In a minority Report the two Scottish members of the Committee proposed that the vessels should be 3old to individuals or to small groups of fishermen owners.Since this Report was received, 74 Trawlers and 15 Drifters have been sold and the post-war requirements of the Fleet have been fixed by the. Staff to include 75 Trawlers and 110 Drifters, leaving for disposal either by public tender or to a Society as proposed by the Committee, or both, 300 Trawlers and 102 Drifters. The Admiralty desire to dispose of these vessels by reserving for the proposed society 250 Trawlers and 50 Drifters, and selling the remaindor by public tender.     It is to this proposal that I now desire the approval of the Cabinet.The constitution of the proposed co-partnerehip society and the terras on which the vessels should be sold to them have been the subject of.discussion between the Admiralty and the Treasury, ana the Admiralty is prepared to modify in some important particulars the original recommendations of the Reconstruction Committee in order to meet the objections of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     As, however, there are still some points outstanding on which we are unable to agree, the Chancellor of the Exchequer desires that the matter should be referred to the Cabinet.The vessels in question have all been built since 1916. Of the 449 Trawlers, 316 have been completed to Admiralty specifica-tions (i.e. for minesweeping purposes and not for fishing).   Of these 84 are still at sea, 230 have been naid off at Milford and Bxightlingoea, but are not reconditioned (i.e. converted for fishing purposes), 2 have been sold, and 133 are in course of construction of which 72 have been sold. 3 au$1919Of
Of the 227 Drifters, 116 were completed to Admiralty specification and are all still in use;     111 are in course of construction of which 15 have been sold.The Scheme proposed by the majority of the Reconstruction Committee and approved by the Board was placed before the Treasury on 1st May 1919.     Briefly it contemplated that 300 Trawlers and 150 drifters should be sold at a prico to be agreed to a co-partnership society composed of fishermen who had served in the Minesweeping and Auxiliary Patrol Service or in the Array during the war, and who wished to resume their calling.The price the Admiralty had in mind was  9,000 for a Trawler and  4,000 for a Drifter or  3,300,000 in all; the Admiralty would allow this sum to remain as a loan to the Society and would also advance the money required for purchase of nets, gear and for working capital, estimated at  700,000, the repay-ment of the total sum of  4,000,000, together with interest being made by instalments spread over a period of 20 years and secured by 4$ debentures.     At the same time one million  1 shares fully paid would be issued gratis to the members of the Society.     The Society,   when once established, would not be in any sense controlled by the Admiralty and no responsibility would re3t with tho Government for its commercial success, but until the debentures had been paid off, there would be a Govern-ment representative on the Board of Directors,The Treasury in a letter of 14th May 1919, rejected this scheme, their main objection being that payment for the vessels would be spread over 20 years, whereas if they were put on the open market the price would be realised at once.As the result of further discussion between the two Departments, the Treasury, on the 11th July, suggested a modified scheme on the following lines:-(1)     the ships to be handed over to tho Associa/tion   at a fair price, based, that is to say, on actual sums realised in tho preceding 3 months, to a total value of not more than&quot; 1,000,000;(2)   all other trawlers and drifters to be sold in themarket as speedily as possible, compatible with not breaking the market for them;(3)   the Association to put up 10% of tho purchase moneyplus working capital - amount of working capital to be the sum which Board of Agriculture and fisheries considers adequate.(4)   If sufficient cash is not raised to enable  1,000,000 worth, of Trawlers and Drifters to be operated., the scheme to be reduced in proportion;   if more than sufficient capital can be raised, the Association would be at liberty*to buy additional ships for cash;(5)   interest on the debentures held by Government to be 5-J$(6)   Government to nominate the first Managing Body, which should include representatives of the shareholders, i.e. those who have put in cash capital;(7)   other regulations to be settled between Treasury andthe Admiralty or the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries;(8)   Government to have a lien on the boats handed to the Association.As it was clear that unless the Treasury would modify these terms the scheme would have to be abandoned, a letter was 3ent -to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the 18th July, statingthat
that the. minimum reductions which the Admiralty could accept to their original scheme would be as followsThe number of vessels to be sold to the Society to be reduced from 450 to 300 (250 Trawlers and 50 Drifters).The price, if the Treasury insisted, to bo increased, for Trawlers, from  9,000 to  10,000 - the total amount of the Government loan would thus not exceed  2,700,000.The vessels to be completed by tho Government for fishing, but not equipped.The rate of interest on the loan might be increased from 4% to 5$.The amount of money ncce33ary for equipment would be -Trawlers  210,000, Drifters  50,000, while about 3200,000 would be required for working capital, making a total of  450,000. The Admiralty would be prepared to ask the fishermen to find this sum, thus saving the Government the necessity of providing any new money, though   it is doubtful if thoy will agree.   It is not possible to ask the men to subscribe any share of the purchase money.The Government would have first call on the boats handed over to the Society and only those men who have subscribed for shares will have any voice in the management.The first Managing Body will be nominated by the Government.The following is an extract from the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ reply of tho 23rd July:-Mfa)     I think your scheme too ambitious to have any prospect of Buccess.     I regard  1,000,000 worth as an outside figure, (b)    As to price, I want a fair market price with the balance in favour of the purchaser,   How is your proposed 9 or 10 thousand   for Drifters correlated with your costs of 18 and 20 thousand     ?I do not understand what is implied in ^completed &apos; - by the Government for fishing&quot;.\q\    I would agree to b%* We could not borrow at that figure (d)     I think the fishermen ought to put up some part of the purchase price.     I would ags&amp;t ;o 5$ instead of 10$.Cabinet approval must be obtained.     I do not like the scheme at all, but would not oppose it if framed as above, provided the Cabinet wished it tried and thouthree Fishery Boards coisld support it.   Have you ever consulted them ?*Tho answer to the la3t point in the Chancellor&apos;s letter i3 that the Fishery Boards of England, Scotland and Ireland were represented on the Heconstruction Committee which originated the scheme.     The representatives of the English and Irish Boards approve and signed the report;   the representative of the Scottish Board disagrees and signed the minority report, which proposed the sale of the ships to individual fishermen.The points now in dispute between the Treasury and the Admiralty are as follows(1)    hQ size of &quot;the Society.     The Treasury want to limit it to  1,000,000.   The Admiralty ask for  2,700,000.(2)   the amount.of capital to be subscribed by the fishermen. The Treasury ask for at least 5% of the purchase price. The Admiralty think that it is doubtful whether even the whole of the capital necessary for equipment can be subscribed and think that no part of the purchase price can be obtained in cash,(3) the price of the Vessels, It is not clear what sura the Treasury would consider a &quot;fair market price&quot;, but there is every reason to believe that the sum of  10,000&quot;
for a Trawler, which the Admiralty piroposos., will prove to he as good an average price as could be obtained in the market for the whole 250.Whilst I give fvjll weight to tho objections of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on financial grounds, there is a question of policy which-l desire to urge upon the Cabinet, In disposing of these vessels v/o have an opportunity of con-ferring a benefit upon the men of the Minesweeping and Auxiliary Patrol, who;rendered ouch gallant and valuable service in the war.     The extent to which these fishermen would appreciate such a benof it was touchingXLy exproased by their representatives when they brought a Deputation to me and stated that they were looking forward  tto this sch&amp;me &quot;fax-more eagerly even than&apos;:.the whole Empire has been waiting for peace to be signed&quot;.The only alternative is to sell the vessels by open tender in which case they will all be bought either directly or indirectly by the men who have, stayed at home and made large profits from fishing, while their fellows have been in service. Financially, this alternative would be better for the State, but politically it is a course which! I think both the House of Commons and th;e Country would condemn.(intlld)   L.23.8,19.Forwarded.(Intlld) &quot; W.H.L.
ADMIRALTY RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.Majority Repoht.4a, Cockspur Street, S.W. 1,24th February 1919. .The Sub-Committee of the Admiralty Reconstruction Committee appointed to consider inter alia Question 2a, &quot; Disposal of Trawlers and Drifters &quot; beg to submit the following further report, dealing with the Admiralty-owned vessels.2. Previous report. In their Interim Report dated 21st December 1918 the Sub-Committee recommend that a certain number, not exceeding 100 Trawlers and 50 Drifters, of those now being completed for fishing, should be sold by tender, preference being given, where there is no loss to the Crown, to owners who have lost vessels during the war in H.M. Service, and this has been approved by the Board.In the same Report the Suh-Committee recommended that the remainder of the Admiralty-owned vessels should be disposed of iu the following manner : (a) A small number to be retained for the instruction of the R.N.R. (T) in Minesweeping and Patrolwork and for other Government work.(b) The residue, in excess of Government requirements, to be sold to Skippers and other fishermenof the R.N.R. (T) who have been employed on Minesweeping and Auxiliary Patrol work during the war.This report deals with the scheme referred to at (b).3. Claims of the R.N.R. (T). By far the greater part of the personnel of the Auxiliary Patrol Service, more especially the Minesweeping section, consisted of fishermen, who may be said without any exaggeration to have constituted the backbone of the force, and the nature and value of the services they rendered can hardly be better described than in the following extract from the Board of Admiralty&apos;s message to the Auxiliary Patrol Service of the 4th January 1919 : &quot;The Auxiliary Patrol Service, from the commencement of the War, was charged Avith the sweeping of mines, and in this hazardous duty has saved many a ship and has earned the gratitude of. His Majesty&apos;s Navy and of the Mercantile Marine. By escort and convoy, also, it has brought safely to port hundreds of ships whose cargoes were of supreme value and concern to the British Empire anil our Allies. When ships were mined, torpedoed or wrecked, the Auxiliary Patrol Vessels have been untiring in their efforts to rescue the crews, and their seamanship, pluck and determination have resulted in the salving of many badly damaged ship3. On the appearance Or report of an Enemy submarine it fell to the Auxiliary Patrol to hunt her by every available method, some of these involving the correct use of highly technical apparatus which the crews learnt to handle with the greatest efficiency.&quot; In all their varied work, round the coasts of the Unite 1 Kingdom, in the North Atlantic, on the African coast, in all parts of the Mediterranean, and in Egyptian waters, the members of the Auxiliary Patrol Service have shown an adaptability and readiness both for hazardous deeds and for steady arduous effort. This new Navy of small craft, created by the special needs of the War, has proved the vitality of the British instinct for the sea and of fbe adventurous spirit of the &quot; scowre-sea Navy &quot; iu the days of the old sailing ships, and has every reason to be proud of its share iu bringing tho VVar to a victorious conclusion.&quot;The great majority of these men, especially those who entered early in the war, have by reason of their service been at a considerable financial disadvantage compared with those who remained in the fishing trade, as the latter have made large sums of money owing to the increased price and demand for fish.Practically the whole of the fishermen employed in the Minesweeping and Auxiliary Patrol Service have been enrolled in the 11.N.R. (T). The few exceptions have served under the agreements known as T. 124 and its variants. Under these agreements they have received pay at rates corresponding to those for the time beiug prevalent in the Mercantile Marine. They have therefore been in a much better position financially than the men serving in the R.N.R. (T), and having regard to this and to the extreme difficulty that there would be in tracing among the numbers of men who have served under the T. 124 agreements those who were fishermen and had served in the Auxiliary Patrol, the Sub-Committee consider that it will much simplify matters and work substantial justice if the benefits of any scheme under clause ( ) of paragraph 2 be confined to the ll.N.11. (T). It is. true that a few of the personnel of the R.N.R. (T) may not be fishermen, but the proportion is very small, and it would be difficult in many oases to draw the line. Besides, any attempt to differentiate these men from the other members of the force would certainly be considered unfair and cause much ill-feeling. They therefore recommend that the benefit of any scheme should be given to the personnel of the R.N.R. (T).4. Government benefit schemes. There are already various Government schemes on foot to benefit men who have served iu H.M. Forces by advancing money for settling them on the land or re-establishing them in business, &amp;c. All these schemes will invoJve heavy expenditure, especially for putting men on the land, as in addition to the cost of the land, there will be the expense of stocking the farms or holdings, and also in a large number of cases the cost of instructing the men, and a largo portion of this expenditure will probably never be repaid.The Sub-Committee are informed that the personnel of the R.N.R. (T) having heard of the above achemes are looking forward to the adoption of something similar for assisting them iu the fishing trade,o   [7.349]   (33) AS 7591-39 (AS 7235-15)  Pk 3489   60  8/19  E&amp;SA
5. Vessels available for disposal. The following table shows the number and classes of vessels that will probably be available for disposal.Description of Trawler.	Length and Tonnage.

Vessels completing for fishing. It is expected that the delivery of the new vessels completing for fishing will be as follows : February 1919, 6 Trawlers, 2 Drifters. March 1919, 10 Trawlers, 9 Drifters.April and subsequent months until the completion of the programme, 15 or 16 Trawlers and 12 or 13 Drifters each mouth.The 100 trawlers and 50 drifters which, as stated in paragraph 2, the Sub-Committee have already recommended should be sold, will, it is understood, be taken from the vessels completing for fishing, those earliest delivered being selected for this purpose. Consequently, if the above estimate of the rate of delivery is correct, no trawlers completing for fishing will be available for disposal under this scheme until September and uo drifters until July 1919.7. Vessels already completed. As regards vessels already completed for Admiralty service, the Sub-Committee understand it will be necessary to employ them all in minesweeping or duties connected there-with and that the greater part will not be released for some months. The Trawlers will then require to have fish-holds fitted, and it is unlikely that many of them will be ready to commence fishing much before the end of this year.8. Numbers of vessels available for disposal. The number of vessels required by the Admiralty or other Government Department for training and other duties, is not likely to be large, as the uses to which those vessels can be put are limited. On the other hand, if the men are to derive any appreciable benefit under the scheme, the number of vessels must be large. Under these circumstances, the Sub-Committeo consider that the number of vessels allocated for purchase by fishermen of the K.N.R. (T.) under this scheme should be approximately 300 Trawlers and 150 Drifters, which will leave sufficient as far as can be seen at present for service requirements.9. Schemes for disposal of Vessels. Of the various schemes which the Sub - Committee have considered for the disposal of these vessels to the K.N.R. (T), all except two require that the Admiralty should retain a commercial interest in the vessels, which seems objectionable both from the point of view of the Admiralty and of the men. The schemes also have the disadvantage of limiting the interest in each vessel disposed of to one individual or to a small group of individuals.The number of vessels available being 450 and the total number of persons eligible about 40,000, it is -obvious that any scheme which involves individual or small group ownership could benefit only a small proportion of the men. This would also be the case if the scheme were confined to the Chief Skippers and Skippers of the E.N.R. (T) of whom there are over 3,0C0. In either case some system of selection would have to be adopted which presumably would be based on the comparative length and merit of the services of the men. This again would be unsatisfactory, as regards relative merit, as the most meritorious candidates might be deficient in the qualities necessary to secure success as owners.   Further, the. Sub-Committeeand some disappointment is felt that no announcement on the subject has yet been made.  If any such scheme bo adopted it will havo the advantages that the men already know their trade, fish are plentiful markets exist and the returns would be immediate.
are unable to suggest any way of selecting a small fraction of men as the most deserving, and even if this could be done it would certainly cause great disappointment and jealousy amonic those not selected. It might also involve allotting trawlers to drifter men and drifters to trawler men, as the numbers of the two classes Of vessels available are not proportionate to the numbers of tho two classes of fishermen. The Sub-Committee are also informed that under present business conditions it would be difficult to make a success of any Trawler owned singly, without placing the management in the hands of existing fishing firms, which they consider undesirable, as a large proportion of the profits of fishiug companies are derived from the numerous subsidiary trades in which the man who merely owns a vessel would not share.10. Mr. Pretymarts scheme. The two schemes which are not open to the above objections are summarised as follows : Scheme A submitted by the Right Hon. E. G. Prctyman, M.P., then Civil Lord and Chairman of the Reconstruction Committee, in which it was proposed that the Treasury be asked to sell the Trawlers and Drifters at preferential rates to associations whose membership would be restricted to those who have served in the minesweepiug and auxiliary patrol service during the war.Men wishing to join an association, but not having the necessary money, might be able to borrow it from those who have remained in the fishing trade during the war. This the Sub-Committee think inadvisable, as it would open the way for existing owners and companies to gain a hand in the management and, perhaps later on, to obtain entire control of the vessels. This objection would, however, be obviated if the-associations were allowed to pay for the vessels by instalments. Again, the larger the number of separate associations the greater becomes the risk, to the Government, of their failure. The smaller the number of vessels in each association the more difficult would it become to make them pay, as their available capital would be insufficisnt for them to possess their own subsidiary businesses, such as ice-making plant, &amp;c. A further disadvantage is that fishing from some ports is more profitable than others, and as these asso-ciations would work from different ports, it would inevitably result in some companies earning larger profits than others, e.g., a company working from Grimsby would &quot; celeris paribus&quot; earn more than one working from Milford, and thus the benefits of the scheme would be unequally distributed.11. Captain Pollerts scheme. Scheme. B submitted by Captain F. H. Pollen, C.B.E., R.X., Mobilising Officer of the Plumber district, appears to the Sub-Committee the only one which is likely to prove satisfactory both to the Government and the men. Under this scheme one large company, or asso-ciation, would be formed, to&quot; which all the vessels available, both trawlers and drifters, would be sold at an agreed price. This the Admiralty would allow to remain as a loan to the Company, and would also advance the money required for purchase of nets, gear, &amp;c., and for working capital. The repayment of these sums, together with interest, would be made by instalments spread over a term of years, and secured by debentures. A number of fully paid shares in the company would be distributed among the fishermen who have served in the R.N.R. (T) and the representatives of men who have been killed or have died while so serving.   This scheme possesses the following advantages : (a) It will enable every fisherman who has served in the R.N.R. (T) to receive a share in the under-taking, and thus avoid the disadvantages inherent in any system whioh iuvolves selection.(b) The earnings of all the vessels being brought into one common stock, benefits will be equallydistributed ; which would not be the case were the vessels to be divided among a number of single owners or small companies or separate associations working from different ports.(c) A large company, such as proposed, should be able to conduct its business more economically thansmaller companies, or individual owners, as it would be able to do its own repairs and manufacture for itself many of the subsidiary requisites, such as ice, nets, &amp;c, and owing to the magnitude of its requirements should be able to purchase others on the most advantageous terms. This is especially the case with regard to trawl fishing. As previously mentioned, one of the disadvantages of any scheme for giving individuals the ownership of trawlers is that a large proportion of the profits would be absorbed by the subsidiary trades which furnish these accessories.(d) Tt would also be able to- establish businesses such as fish curing and the manufacture of manure,which could usefully be combined with its main business of fishing.(e) A considerable saving could also be effected in the matter of insurance, as a company of this sizeshould in time be able to create its own insurance fund.12. Control of Company. The business of the Company, which might be called the Minesweepers and Auxiliary Patrol Co-partnership, Ltd., would be controlled by a Board of Directors-assisted by a general manager with a sub-manager at each of the four or five ports from which the vessels would work. The Government should have representation on the Board to look after its financial interests until the Debentures had been paid off.13. Beneficial Effect on Fishing Industry.-The formation of such a company should assist materially in the improvement of the fishing industry of this country, and this would be a great asset from the national point of view. Other companies would, however, look upon it as a powerful competitor, but it is considered there is ample scope for them all.The Admiralty vessels are probably better found than many of those privately owned, and it is antici-pated that the conditions of living on board would be superior. &apos; Also the fact that the shareholders will all be either working fishermen or connected with them should ensure that the wages paid by the Company are at least as good as those paid by any other ; and any surplus profits, after paying dividends, expenses, depreciation, and sinking fund could be devoted to iinproviug the conditions of the company. In short it is expected that the Company would set an example of good management, good vessels, good living conditions for the crews, and good wages, which private companies and even singly owned vessels will be bound to follow.It should also be practicable with such a large concern and capital to devise methods of improving the organisation as regards the vessels themselves, the subsidiary undertakings, the fish distribution aiuTsale. It may even be possible later on to devote attention and funds to piscatorial research work.. All these would be helpful.to the Company as well as the fishing industry in general.14. Market prices of traivlers.-K point of great importance, upon which the success or failure of the scheme will largely depend, is the price at which the vessels are to be acquired.   At present, prices are much
higher than thoso prevailing beforo the war, and it appears impracticable to form any reliable estimate of the market value of the vessels in the near future.The tenders received for the first lot of Admiralty vessels offered for sale, consisting of 50 Trawlers and 25 Drifters, to be delivered ready for fishing during February, March and April 1919, varied very greatly.  In the case of Trawlers the prices offered wore as follows : 1     &quot; Strath &quot; Class (20 vessels offered), 52 tenders ranging between  5,500 and  17,500.  Average, 12,000.  Average of 20 highest tenders,  14,-100. &quot;Castle&quot; Class (15 vessels offered), 14 tenders ranging between  10,000 and  18,000.   Average, 14,300.     * &quot; .&quot; Mersey &quot; Class (15 vessels offered), 34 tenders ranging between  12,000 and  21,500.   Average, 17,800. - .It was, however, pointed out to the Sub-Committee by the representative of the Contract and Purchase Department that many of the tenders were for the same individual vessel, usually the one to be delivered first, and consequently cannot be taken as applicable to the remainder. It must also be borne in mind that these tenders were made for new vessels to be delivered at once, ready for fishing, so that they can be set to work immediately, and thus obtain the benefit of the high prices now being charged for fish. They would also have the advantage of being amongst the first to fish several of the best grounds which have been inaccessible during the war, from which they are certain to obtain very heavy catches, judging by the results obtained from other and inferior grounds.On the other hand, the first of the vessels to be sold to the proposed company under this scheme will not be available for delivery for several months. By that time the above-mentioned advantages will have disappeared, and over three-fourths of the vessels, instead of being new, will have been at sea for more than a year. Further, all the privately owned vessels now in Admiralty service will then have been released. It is therefore practically certain that the prices of fishing vessels will by then have fallen very considerably.Taking these factors into consideration, the representatives of the Contract and Purchase Department informed the Sub-Committee that they considered it very improbable that the capital value of the Trawlers to be sold to the company, if governed by home market considerations, would exceed  For the &quot; Strath &quot; Class -     -     -     -.....10,000,,    ,, &quot;Castle&quot;   ,,.........11,500,,    ,, &quot;Mersey&quot; ,,.........12,50015. Market Price of Drifters. The drifters recently offered for sale consisted of 13 steel and 12 wooden vessels.For the steel drifters only 9 tenders were received, ranging from  2,150 to  5,400, the average being  4,100 ; for the wooden Drifters 11 tenders, ranging from  2,150 to  6,505, the average being  4.000.Jn considering the price of drifters it must be remembered that drift net fishing cannot be said to be in full operation before May. Also there is not likely to be any great demand for drifters until more stable conditions are established in Russia and Germany, to whioh countries more than three-fourths of the catch was exported before the war. On the other hand, before any drifters are available for sale to the proposed company the drifting season of 1919 will be far advanced. Under these circumstances the representatives of the Contract and Purchase Department stated that it was impracticable to make any reliable forecast of the market price of drifters.16. Competition of Private Companies. Another matter affecting the iprices at which the Company should acquire these vessels is that many of the existing companies, with which the proposed company will have to compete, are in a strong financial position, and are enabled to give the high prices at present offered, by having written down the values of their existing fleets to figures much below the market values. A new company is in a very different position, and oould not afford to pay those prices without seriously prejudicing its prospects of success.17. Prices to be paid. The Sub-Committee have consulted several gentlemen of experience in the fishing trade and finance, who, with one exception, consider that the company has good prospects of success provided that it can obtain the vessels at reasonable prices, which, they consider, should be  9,000 for the Trawlers (as an average price) and  4,000 for the Drifters, these prices to include the fitting of fish holds and other alterations nece-sary to adapt the vessels for fishing, besides any overhaul and refitting which may be necessary, but not equipment.These prices may seem small when compared with those now obtainable, but when the facts previously mentioned with regard to the age of the vessels and time of delivery are taken into consideration, the Sub-Committee doubt if they will prove to be much below the average prices that could be obtained during the period over which the deliveries will be spread. If they are compared with the figures given by the Contract and Purchase Department, set out in paragraphs 14 and 15, it will be seen that the price of the drifters is practically the same as the average of the tenders. As regards the trawlers, the estimated values, are Strath &quot; Class,  10,000; &quot;Castle&quot; Class,  11,500; &quot;Mersey &quot; Class,  12,500. Assuming the 300 trawlers to be acquired by the Company are made up of 100 &quot; Strath&apos;s,&quot; 130 &quot;Castle&apos;s,&quot; and 70 &apos;* Mersey&apos;s,&quot; which, from the table given in paragraph 5, would appear to be about the correct proportions, the average value of the vessels would be  11,230. The difference therefore between&apos;the value as estimated by the Contract and Purchase Department and the price to be paid by the Company would be  2,230 per vessel, or  6,70,000 on the total fleet. Taking the number of men who would benefit under the scheme as 40,000, this would represent a cost to the country of only  16 15s. per head, which would be small in relation to the services they hnve rendered.18. Payment for Vessels-It would not be possible for the company to pay for the vessels at once unless . it raised the money, either by borrowing from outside sources, or by issuiug share capital for subscription. The first of these courses is undesirable and the latter impracticable; if, as is intended, the holding of shares is to be confined to fishermen of the R.N.R. (T) or their representatives.It will also be necessary to provide money for the purchase of nets, warps, &amp;c., and also for working capital.   The amount required for the latter purpose, however, should not be very large, as the vessels
ought to bo earning almost from tho commencement of the business more than sufficient to cover working expenses.19. Method of Payment proposed. Tho Sub-Committee therefore recommend that tho price of the vessels should be allowed to remain as a loan to the Company, and that tho Government should also advance the sums required for the purchase of gear, &amp;c, and for working capital. The repayment of all those moneys should be made by instalments spread over a considerable period so as to enable the Company to make payment out of its earnings, the payment with interest being secured by debentures charged upon the Company&apos;s undertaking and assets. It may be pointed out that by this means the Admiralty would retain a hold on the vessels until they were fully paid for, aud in the event of default in payment it could realise the vessels to recoup itself.20. Financial Scheme. The proposed scheme has been submitted to Sir Arthur Whinney, K.B.E., Adviser on Costs of Production to the Accountant-General&apos;s Department, who has prepared a short memorandum dealing with it from the financial point of view, which will be found as an Appendix to this report.As will be seen, this contemplates the formation of a company with a nominal capital of  1,500,000 in  1 shares. Of these, 1,000,000 shares will be issued to the Admiralty and distributed by the latter among the persons who are to benefit under the scheme ; the remaining 500,000 shares to be kept in reserve, and offered for subscription later on, should it prove desirable to raise further capital for the establishment of subsidiary businesses or otherwise furthering the Company&apos;s interests.It will be noticed in the Appendix that the rate of interest upon the money advanced by the Govern-ment is taken at 4 per cent. It may be objected that this is too low a rate, seeing that Government is at present borrowing at 5 per cent. It must, however, be remembered that the repayment of the money will be spread over a period of probably 20 years. During that time the rate of interest on Government funds is likely to be reduced, aud the Sub-Committee have taken 4 per cent, as a reasonable rate for that period.21. Subsidiary Businesses. The Company should establish their own ice-making plant and repair shops as soon as possible, but the other subsidiary businesses, such as fish curing, &amp;c, should be deferred till a later date, when the further capital required could probably be obtained by the issue of fresh shares to be subscribed for by the members themselves.22. Distribution of Shares.-A.s to the method of distributing shares amongst the men, the Sub-Committee consider that, subject to what is stated hereafter with regard to the men who have volunteered for post-war minesweeping, the distribution should be based solely on length of service, without regard to rank or individual merit. They believe that this will not only be simple but will probably be the only popular method with the recipients as a whole. They therefore suggest that every man should receive one share for each two months&apos; service in the R.N.R. (T) between 4th August 1914 and 31st December 1918; provided he was not discharged for misconduct. This, it is estimated, would absorb approximately 803,500 shares.23. Extra Shares Jor Post-war Sweeping. It is also suggested that the men employed iu post-war minesweeping should be given some additional reward, from the date when it became necessary to call up voluuteers for this dangerous duty, and although they are receiving extra pay, they would probably have earned still more with considerably less risk had they elected to return to fishing, as the remainder have done.The Sub-Committee therefore recommend. that each man engaged in post-war minesweeping should receive 1 share for every month completed in this service since 1st January 1919. These shares would be provided from the 190,000 odd shares left over after distributing the shares mentioned in the preceding paragraph.24. To give some idea of the actual benefits that would be received under the scheme, suppose a man served continuously in the R.N.R. (T) from 1st January 1915 to 31st December 1918 and then serves for a further period of 6 months in post-war minesweeping. His service during the first period would amount to 36 months, for which he would receive 18 shares in the Company. He would also receive 1 share for each month of post-war sweeping, i.e., 6 shares, making 24 shares in all. The value of the shares at first would be small, but they would gradually increase as the debentures were paid off. When this has been done, the total value of the issued share capital, assuming that proper provision has been made for depreciation, should be at least equal to the original amount of the debentures, i.e.,  4,000,000, and as the number of the shares issued will be 1,000,000 this would be equal to  4 a share.At the end of 20 years, therefore, the man, whose case we have taken should be in possession of 24 shares Avorth  4 each, or  96. In addition to this he will duriug that period have received whatever diAridends are paid on the shares, which on an average of 5 per cent, per annum (not an unreasonable estimate), Avould come to  1 As. per annum, or for the whole period a further sum of  24. In other words the man would have gained a total sum of  120 in 20 years, or an average of  6 a year. A thrifty man Avould also be able to add to his holding in the company by investing his savings in the purchase of further shares, as Avith such a large capital and so many shareholders, opportunities of buying shares are likely to occur fairly frequently.25. Control of Shares. In order to prevent speculation in the shares it is considered advisable to prohibit transfers of shares, except in the case of death of the holder, for a certain period from their allotment. It is further recommended that the number of shares that may be held by any single shareholder should be limited, and that the Board of Directors should at all times have an absolute discretion as to the acceptance or rejection of a transfer. They think this desirable for the purpose of preventing the control of the company from passing into the hands of a few individuals, or possibly of other fishing companies or owners of fishing vessels.26. It may be desirable to . allow the R.N.R. (T) avIio Avish to invest any spare money they may have in the Company, with a view to paying off the Debentures at an earlier date than at present anticipated ; Ave consider this question should be left to the discretion of the Board of Management.o  AS 7591-39  
27. This scheme, like all the others which havo come before tho Sub-Committee, proposed that tho men who received benefits under it should be obliged to serve in tho R.N.U. (T). At first sight this seems an attractive suggestion, but the Sub-Committee, after careful consideration, are doubtful whether it is desirable to impose this condition, for the following reasons : (a) They believe that the men would look upon it with suspicion, and would regard the scheme as a form of pressure to servo in the Reserve.(b) It would still be necessary to pay the men at least part of the ordinary retainer, for the benefitsthey would receive under the schemo would not be equal, varying as they would according to the number of shares given to each man, and in no case are likely, at any rate for some years to come, to be equal in value to the retainer, even if this is only on the pre-war scale.(c) It would create a difficulty with regard to admitting to benefits of the scheme disabled men and the widows or representatives of deceased men.(d) Since, as above mentioned, the number of men who would come under the scheme is about 40,000, itwould provide a force of R.N.R. (T) much larger than is necessary.An alternative suggestion was put forward that the vessels sold to the Company should be manned by R.N.R. (T) crews until the price had been paid in full. If, however, the Company could only employ men of the R.N.R. (T) it might have difficulty in finding crews for its vessels, and would be to some extent at the mercy of the men, who, owing to their limited numbers, might perhaps be in a position to demand exorbitant pay or other conditions of service.It is therefore proposed that the question of whether any conditions should be imposed on the shareholders who are qualified to join the Naval Reserves should be left open until the views of the fishermen have been ascertained.28. The members of the Sub-Committee representing the Scottish Fishery interests would prefer the drifters being sold to individuals or families or other small bodies of fishermen, which might consist of a number equal to a vessel&apos;s crew, and they propose to send in a minority report. The remainder of the Committee do not consider it necessary to delay sending in this report, because to whatever scheme the Scottish representatives may propose there appears to the rest of the Sub-Committee to be the following ) adical objections: Assuming the number of drifters which the Scottish drifter men of the R.N.R. (T) would be entitled by virtue of their numbers, to buy, to be 100, it would only be possible to benefit at the most, say, 1,000 men out of a total of, say, 14,000. The remaining 13,000 could receive no benefit at all, although they might have served equally well in the R.N.R. (T) and might be equally desirous of obtaining a vessel or a share in one. Mauy would be debarred from this benefit because they were unable to produce enough money to purchase a boat or a share in one. It is considered that the man with a certain amount of capital should not have this advantage over the poorer man, especially as the former, being a shareholder of the proposed company, would be able to use his money to advantage by buying further shares in the Company, and if the operations of the Company were successful the value of his shares would appreciate ; he would also in time be able to increase his holding, if thrifty, and be able to buy a vessel of his own.29. In conclusion the Sub-Cornmittee wish to state that they have not attempted to do more than put forward the main features of the scheme for the consideration of the Admiralty aud the Government, especially with regard to the financial considerations. If the scheme is approved, many details will have to be&quot; settled, and in doing so it will be necessary to call in the assistance of further experts and consult some of the skippers.  A further report will then be submitted.(Signed)     W. H. MAY,Admiral of the Fleet (Chairman).S. R. MILLER, Captain, R.N.E. F. PARKER, M.D.A.P.WILFRID MEDD, for A.G.H. RUNDLE. for D.M.S.JOHN C.

APPENDIX.Proposal for transferring Admiralty-Built Trawlers and Drifters to the Skippers and Crews of the R.N.R. (T.)ENGAGED upon MlNESWEEPING and auxiliary patrol during the war.Memorandum by Sir A. Whinney, K.B.E., Adviser on Cost of Production to the / A.G.&apos;s Department.1. Reconstruction Committee. It is understood that the objects desired to be achieved are (a) To realise the large fleet of Drifters and Trawlers which have been built by the Admiralty duringthe war.(b) To benefit the Officers and men who have been at sea on them by permitting them to start orcontinue fishing operations with the use of the boats.2. It will be seen that these two objects are mutually destructive the one of the other unless realisation can take place under conditions which will ensure the use of the boats to the Officers and Crews.3. It is, therefore, proposed that a Company shall be formed to acquire the boats at an agreed sum, and that the Government shall provide such further amount as is necessary to equip the fleet for fishing and also for Working Capital.4. It is suggested that 300 Trawlers and 150 Drifters should be transferred to a Compa,ny to be formed to be called the Minesweepers and Auxiliary Patrol Co-Partuership, Ltd., the Ordinary Shares to be allotted as part consideration to be transferred by the Admiralty to the Minesweepers engaged during the war. A carefully prepared plan for the distribution of such shares will be required to be drawn up, an essential feature being each man&apos;s length of service.5. The price at which the Trawlers are to be transferred to the Company is  9,000 each, and the Drifters  4,000 each after the Boats have been reconditioned and made suitable for fishing by the construc-tion of fish-holds, &amp;c.6. In order to provide for Equipment, Nets, Trawls, (fee, 10 per eent. upon the value of the Trawlers and 25 per cent, on Drifters has been provided.7. Representations have been made to the effect that it is most important that provision should be made for the erection of Repair Shops and Ice Factories, and if funds will allow, for fish-curing establishments and for the conversion of waste fish into manure.   Provision must also be made for Working Capital.8. The figures will work out as follows:     -    300 Trawlers at  9,000   -.....-     2,700,000Equipment, 10 per cent.......        270,0002,970,000 750,000150 Drifters at  4,000 600,000Equipment, 25 per cent.    -      -     -     - -        150,0003,720,000Cash Working Capital and for Erection of Ice Factories, Repair Shops, &amp;o, ,        - 280,000 4,000,0009. It is proposed under the Scheme that Mortgage Debentures should&apos;be issued to the Admiralty to cover the above outlay, and for its repayment over a period of 20 years, together with interest at 4 per cent, per annum.10. It is, therefore, proposed that a Sinking Fund should be brought into operation upon the. principle of providing a fixed sum per annum which will provide repayment of the principal and for interest at 4 per cent, over 20 years.   The amount thus to bo set aside out of Profits is  294,328.11. Provision will also be necessary for Depreciation and Maintenance and for Insurance against Maritime risks, &amp;c. It. is suggested that this should be done by means of a fund to be set aside out of Profits, tho amount of whioh will require very careful consideration.12. It will be very important to ensure that tbo Company is governed by persons having practical commercial knowledge of the subject as well as financial ability. There can be little doubt that tho Company, competing as it will with vested interests will be the subject of attack, and it is therefore most important that these interests should be well looked after.

The Nominal Capital is  1,500,000 Shares of  1 each, of which there shall be issued to the fishermen as fully paid 1,000,000 Shares leaving 500,000 Shares in reserve for future developments.15. It is. not possible to form a reliable estimate of the exact amount of the profits which may reasonably be expected to arise from the operations of the Company, but it is considered that they will be ample to provide for the following : V&quot; L           \ .. .                                 ^   Sinking Fund on a 20 years basis, principal and interest at 4 per cent, perannum   -            -            -     ......     -     -     -     -      - 294,328Depreciation at 5 per cent, per annum (on capital value of the Boats, 3,300,000)   ---     -     -     ......     .     . 165,000 459,328and a reasonable dividend upon the Shares issued.In the event of profits permitting, it is proposed that a larger contribution to the Sinking Fund than that provided for as the minimum under the Scheme should be made.16. It is well to remark that if a Scheme of this nature can be successfully launched, not only will the country have discharged its debt of gratitude to those who have been engaged in minesweeping during the war, but a nucleus Reserve will be created upon which the country could draw should the need again arise.ARTHUR WHINNEY.&apos;  3.2.1919.
