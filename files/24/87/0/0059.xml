fHIS DOCIflCTT 13 THE PR(.V&quot;.:?Y Qji1 HI3 7u.IT A TTMC MAJESTY1 3 G0VERN1MT.) *SECRET...... WAR CABINET.S..T. 8Q58.&quot; THIT DISPOSAL OF ADMIRALTY pVftg&amp;^TRAl^flRSAND DRIFTERS.(M-emoranduri by the Chancellor of the Exchequer)*The Admiralty scheme for the disposal of trawlers and drifters, as criminally submitted to the Treasury, was open to the following serious financial objections ..4-(a) Instead- of receiving cajih for our assets at a time when cash is .very -seriously needed we. were t&apos;* take Debentures to the value of  3,300,000, which might nr night net be paid., fjff in a, $eriedof 20 years.(b) We were- to get only 4$ interest upon the Debentures which is lc3s than the rate at. which Government bcrrows.(c) ,We had actually to find an additional  700,000 for gear and, working capital upon the same terms.(d) We. were to sell the ships we had built at oumo less than 5o%. of the cost of building and at prices substantially less than those realised for ships sold in the market, and by these means to- float a very large co-partnership scciety which would thus be in effect a subsidised company, trading.in competition with private companies.(e) -The avowed object was-, to give a special bonus to one par-ticular claso of the Naval Service,- the Trawler Reserve, which; is eligible for all the other. advantages,- in the way .*,f pay, gratuity, etc.. of the re3t of the Naval Service, . and&apos;thus aet upa possible grievance in.other branches.of the Service and possible claims for similar treatment in the disposal, of Government assets.(f) The scheme.was not approved by the Scottish. Fishery Boara, wh..*se repre?entativeo signed a Minority Report in favour cf &quot;fisherman, ownership&quot; and protests began to reach me from.-Employer9 Associations, who complained of the subsidised corn-petition to. which they, w-uld be subjected.In the negotiations with the Admiralty, - the course of which i3 set out in tfte Admiralty memorandum, *s me., of the-more dangerous features of the scheme have been removed, but the Admiralty have felt unable to accept the -suggestion-:I- put. forward that the scheme should be confined to  .-ne million, pounds worth, of trawlers and drifters.   I do,not understand why it should be thought that a scheme so limited ecu Id not be succ esuful.   It seems to me extremely hazardous to start so ambitious a project to be run as a Fishermen^ Company.   The Fiohermen would not have a personal interest in the ships other than a certain number of gratuitous shares distributed between them.   The tendency will be to run up the wages bill and let the profits gi,   This-wjll endanger the prospects of recover&apos;.&quot;- of interest, and from a political point r-f view it will be. extremely difficult for the Government to foreclose and sell off the ships.
I am n*t my self in favour 4f the proptsal in any form but it is a proper Matter for a Cabinet decision.Incidentally I w*ul,d remark that.it seems a very daubt-ful policy to. build at the cwtft of Navy Vetes trawlers and drifters fox fishifts purposes instead tf leaving it to the ordinary laws of supply and demand to determine what numbers should be built.   I nstealao that&quot; the tfarai Staff prsptfse to include 75 trawlers and 110 drifters in the p*st-war Fleet; a, course which I think should be-rc&quot;&apos;it-ed in srdcr that thetfe ships also may be available far fishing.   The re-conditioning of trawlers and drifters sh-uld be pruoeeded *ith as rapidly as possible and in preference to purely naval wark.(Initialled)   A.C.Treasury,28th August, 1919.
