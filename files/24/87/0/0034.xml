1193 S.. Foreign Secret, Afghanistan. Your telegram of the .13th August. We regret in connection with peace negotiations you feel that we have been guilty of two breaches of fundamental principle that important decisions of policy should not be taken without consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government.The first relates to Afghanistan^ emancipation from our control over her foreign relations. But on this matter we have endeavoured to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government throughout. It has engaged our careful consideration ever since Habibulla&apos;s last letter (vide our telegram of 11th February) and Amanulla&apos;s succession (vide our telegram of ,23rd March), and in warning His Majesty&apos;s Govcrn-ment in our telegram No. 1614 S. of the 10th July that it would prove crux of the peace negotiations we sought to make clear that while time had passed for our political control to figure explicitly in formal treaty, we hoped to be able to compass our ends by indirect means. Nor did language of your telegram of the 16th July, though it emphasised the importance His Majesty&apos;s Government attached to our retaining such control in fact, appears to preclude us from seeking so to secure it. In our telegram No. 1105 S. of the 30th July, we reported Grant&apos;s foremost conclusion after . the second meeting of the conference that&quot; &quot;the Afghans will not in any-circninstances agree to the old arrangement regarding their foreign relations.&quot; In our telegram 1114 S. of 1st August we reported Grant&apos;s written statement to Afghan delegates on the subject, adding that we throughout anticipated freedom of foreign relations proving first of Afghan demands. Neither of these reports elicited any criticism or even comment from His Majesty&apos;s Government. Nevertheless, when Grant reported that separate written assurance on the matter was sine qua non of continuance of negotiations, we sought your approval in our telegram of 1123 S. of 4th August to formula to be employed. We solicited answer by evening of next day, so critical was situation. We waited until noon of day following. We then &quot;tele-graphed to Grant, &quot;Secretary of State&apos;s orders have not yet been received. If, however, it is question of signature of the treaty by the delegates now or of reference to Kabul with&apos;grave risk inherent in delay, then you are authorised to give desired written assurance regarding external relations in such form as you think suitable within limits of formula you have submitted.&quot; We ourselves are satisfied that Grant was actually confronted by such a question, and acted rightly. Having ourselves had to face the responsibility of allowing the negotiations to drag on with grave risk of breaking down or of anticipating His Majesty&apos;s Governments instructions, we were greatly relieved that His Majesty&apos;s Governments, decision received later the same afternoon coincided witli our own. ,Over the modifications of our draft treaty, it is true, we failed to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government. But those modifications appeared, and still appear, to us non-essential and as such covered by that latitude extended to us in your telegram of the 16th July in which you remarked &quot; no instructions given in advance cnu provide for all situations that may arise.&quot; We had reached crisis in negotiations, with frontier still in state of acutest tension, and we did not feel justified in running the risk of delay of insisting on wording derogatory to the Amir personally which Afghan delegates could not accept without Amir&apos;s prior concurrence which might obviously never have been obtainable. - 1We note with gratification that your criticisms do not extend to results obtained, but only to means employed. - We, ourselves, are satisfied that results could not have been obtained within the same time (and time was very material factor) by any other means.
