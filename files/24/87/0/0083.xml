No, bidl5/SG.18th August 1919.
(Copy).. (6905).        1 Translation.To thePrime Minister of tho United Kingdom of Great Britainand Ireland,The attached letter has been received from the War Office, contents of which have been brought to the knowledge of the prisoners of war;The British government s uncompromising attitude shows me, that it is not fully informed concerning the state of mind of prisoners of war and interned. . An explanation of this fact may be that the British Commandants have been unable to l^arn the psychology of prisoners of war and interned. - The German officer and soldier is accustomed under the influence of his training to restrain his feelings, liis outwardly calm behaviour,   his sense of order and disciplinej his apparent acceptance of each situation may have deceived the Commandants into supposing that the German prisoners of war and interned were satisfied with their fate. As one who knows the German military psychology, ,1 as the Senior representative of the German forces in England, hold it to be my duty to draw the attention of the British Government to the fact that the prisoners of war and Interned have reached the utmost-limits of their endurance...In the P.0.VJ. -and Internment Camps there/ are still prisoners of war from 1914) ,15.and 16 and fathers and supporters of families from the ages of 50 to 60*   Even during the war inthe case of officers and N. CtO&apos;s......18 months was cons^er&amp;d to bethe limit of endurance... Since August 18 repatriation/ irr the case of a few sick and wounded has been absolutely stopped.   The Armistice and the ratification of peace on the side of Germany have not affected this delay, . If this systematic exchange gave to the officers hitherto a terrain at least to their captivity, the abrogation of exchange awoke again a feeling that the end of this uncertainty which contributes to the decline of the prisoners-of war and interned&apos;s power of resistance&apos; and to their loss of&quot; cheerfulness...everel comforting assurances given most probably in good faith by British commandants have caused further sore dis-appointment through their non-fulfilment.-- Even if the individual need not worry himself about food, he must- still greatly suffer under the weight of care, ..which his future and family give him in the unsettled conditions at ho^e all of which tends to undermine his health... Under tho terrible burden of captivity he feels that-strength going, of which he is in need for the struggle of life and it is exactly this strength which he requires in his forthcoming stern fight for existence. . Almost every officer will be compelled to enter a new profession, which- for the Senior Officers with
families is especially a heavy care as they are mostly without means.   Every day longer in captivity lowers their vitality and lessens their opportunity In life.   :;,;any also still suffer considerably from the consequences of their wounds and sicknesses *All prisoners of War and interned feel most unjust and inhuman that, they, who nave only done their duty and served their country, should be placed on a lower scale as for as human rights are concerned as common criminals.   Latter know at any rate the duration of their sentence which is decided by the judge. The prisoner of war has not this comfort.It must be acknowledged that the position which the British Government takes up is formally right according to the treaty.   I would wish however to draw the attention of the British Government to the facj, that in the phrase &quot;ratification by three powers&quot; there lies an Uncertainty as to ratification at all as no final date can be fixed at all;   and I would submit it to the British Government whether it would rather not give preference to the moral aspect of the case rather than the legal and i mediately take up again the repatriation of prisoners of war and interned on theigrounds of simple humanity, the abrogation of which repatriation arouses ,in the hearts of prisoners of war and interned the feeling of unjust and cruel treatment;Thus feeling of cruel treatment is strengthened further by the fact, that even small ameliorations which would have shown some sign of humanity and which after the&apos; ratification by Germany were ardently expected, have not yet been granted.   For this first of all it would be necessary to grant, the recommencement of a regular repatriation, the free use of the post and a regular and quicker despatch of letters.The absolute uncertainty as to when three powers will have ratified undermines the last of the prisoners of.war and interned&apos;s power of endurance.I beg therefore that in spite of its formal rights the British Government on the grounds of simple humanity will immed-iately take up the repatriation of all prisoners of war of 1914; 15 and 16 and of fathers and supporters of families from, the are . of 58 onwards.(Signed)   Rear Admiral von Router.
