S9 laesaee,,n \X:/ r-.(P 5055)        From Seeretarij of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,28th August 1919.Priority A.   Clear the line.Foreign Secret, Your telegram No. &quot;1-218 S., dated 23rd August. Afghanistan. My only information as to feelings of Afghan delegates &quot;in regard to Amir&apos;s title is that conveyed in your telegram of 7th August which scarcely suggests that they regarded point as one of immediate Urgency. Your present argument logically involves giving to the Amir in advance as bribes the advantages which are intended to be rewards after six months of good behaviour, and I am very reluctant to say or do anything which could suggest that Afghan Government has been restored to favour until it has given some earnest of future good behaviour. It seems to me that grant of title at present juncture would merely serve to enhance&apos;Amir&apos;s sense of his own importance to us, and thus make it the less likely that resumption of negotiations will find him in amenable frame of mind.
