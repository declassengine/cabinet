- ;r, the Property offor aft Minute to the War Cabinet.3Sty&apos;o Government.from  the Foreign Office telegrams and telegrams in theThe Fourteen Points Again.(1.) That President Wilson&apos;s agents have endeavoured to put upon the Turkish Government the responsibility for and the power to prevent the massacre of Armenians.(2) That the American Government threatens that points 2 and 14 of the famous points will be cancelled if the Turkish Government cannot or does not accept this responsibility.(3) That this ultimatum or threat was not issued on behalf of the Allies.The threat seems to me to have been singularly perplexing.   The long delay in the Turkish peace has resulted in a very distressing situation in Constantinople and in the enfeeblement of the Turkish Government machine, never a strong one.   Rigorous.limitations have been put upon the Turkish Army, both on its size and its activities.  The Greeks, going to Asia Minor under the suspices of the Allies, have been massacring the Turks, and the Turks have been unable to assist their own nationals.   Is it possible, then, that the Turkish Government could, if it would, come to the rescue of the Armenians without the assistance of the Allies ?   Is it, then, hoped by the American Government that the Turkish Government can do what is asked of it ?   Or is it that the author of the Fourteen Points desires to persuade his conscience that the dismembering of the Turkish Empire on principles wholly out of harmony with his Fourteen Points is legitimate, that he desires to seek excuses for refusing Ottoman sovereignty over regions which are strictly Turkish, that he wants the Muslim city of Adrianople to be handed over to Greets or Bulgarians, and that the only way he can do it is to put the blame upon the Turkish Government?   Or is it that, anxious to avoid the necessity of becoming responsible for the safety of the Armenians himself, he wishes to assure public opinion in the world that although America will do nothing herself, by threatening for what is perhaps inevitable impotence a punishment which will not at any rate embroil American foreign relations or endanger the stability of the American Commonwealth, she is doing something of real assistance to the Armenians &apos;?From one point of view, the threat strengthens the case which I have always consistently advocated to the Cabinet. For if by any chance what seems unlikely results and Armenians are not massacred, it follows that there will be no excuse of any sort left, even to President Wilson, for not enforcing points 2 and 1.4 of the Fourteen Points. The maintenance of Ottoman sovereignty over regions which are strictly Turkish will therefore be achieved, and certain greedy Powers will have to go hungry, some of the contemplated distribution of Turkish territory will not be possible, or, at any rate, it will be difficult for the American Government to assist in such distribution.But I had always thought that&apos; as the war ended on the Fourteen Points as modified and commented upon by the Entente Governments, they were no longer a matter which merely concerned the honour and conscience of their author, but were of importance to all signatories of the Armistice. I am glad to note that this view has also been expressed in Paris.E. S. M.27th August 1919,SS 206  100  8/19
