This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.WAR CABINET.THE  FUTURE OF THE ARMY.Gen. No. 4769&quot;I shall be glad if my colleagues will consider the following Memorandum which&apos; has been prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.20th August, 1919.Before the war the Military Forces were directed to fulfil three functions, viz. : (a.) Peace garrisons throughout the Empire. (6.) Drafts from home to keep those garrisons up to strength, (c.) The organization of those draft-finding units into formations up to divisions, inclusive making a total in point of fact of 6 Regular and 14 Territorial divisions and thus constituting a force which, when the Reserve was called up, could intervene in small wars and guarantee Home Defence.2. Three things must be noted :  (a.) The Army was raised on a voluntary basiSj and it must be clear that an army so raised will in all probability have no relation to the policy of the Government. It happened by chance that the voluntary effort of these Islands, amounting to some 30,000 recruits, a year, did give us peace garrisons, draft-finding units and a small expeditionary force. But the expeditionary force of 6 divisions had no relation to any wars that could be conceived-it was too big for some and it was too small for others.(b.) There was no real intention on the part of England to intervene in any great war on the continent of Europe that this was so was abundantly clear from the size of the Armies that the Great Powers could place in the field as compared to those which we disposed of.(c.) There was, in the minds of many people, a real danger of an invasion of these islands.3. Now that the war is over we are faced with a somewhat different problem :  (a.) We still have to find peace garrisons for the Empire.(6.) We still have to keep draft-finding units to keep those garrisons up to strength.(c.) We still require a small and very efficient force capable of moving at short notice overseas;but(d.) There is no longer any possibility nor any danger of another great european war for some years to come, (e.) There is no longer, for years to come, any danger of invasion.4. If the foregoing very short review of the situation before the war and the situation to-day is correct, and I confess that it seems to me to be irrefutable, then it follows, dealing with the immediate future only and taking a short view of our present necessities, that .(a..) We do not require any power of great expansion.(6.) We do not require any troops allotted for Home Defence only.5. Although the conclusions arrived at in paragraph 4 follow logically on the position we are now in, as stated in paragraph 3, I have to observe one other fact in which we differ somewhat from our position in 1914 and that is we are much more likely to need troops of an expeditionary nature for our oversea possessions to-day than we were in 1914.
6. It is true that in 1914 we narrowly escaped civil war in Ireland ; it is equally true that the state of Ireland now is at least as bad as at any period in 1914 ; but we have to-day much more danger facing us in Egypt, in Mesopotamia, and in India than -anything that we could have foreseen in 1914.7. lam now working out the minimum number of troops and of aeroplanes which in the opinion of the General Staff might be required to deal with a crisis in Ireland, a crisis in Egypt, a crisis in Mesopotamia, and a crisis in India. It is possible, it is even probable, that if we get into difficulties, in any one of those theatres we shall get into difficulties in all four. When I have arrived at rough figures I shall be able to make an estimate of the total annual cost. I can then submit a short paper showing those two items, i.e., the total force required for all the peace garrisons and for the reinforcements of those peace garrisons in case of disturbances, and the same paper will show the cost of this effort. But I shall have to put in a saving clause pointing out that my proposals are only for the immediate future and that taking a longer view of the military situation of the world it will probably be both necessary and wise to re-organize the forces of the Empire on a broader basis and one which will admit of considerable expansion in the case of a large war.HENEY WILSON,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.7th August, 1919.
