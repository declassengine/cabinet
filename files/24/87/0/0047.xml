% /. . (jy/ -J^* cjz-o 1THIS. DOCUMENT IS TH3 PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAN&amp;IC yAJ3JSTY&apos;S GOVBRNMSKT.)SECRET. ,.G.T* 0046.TAR .CABINET.OMCE ACCOm-IODATIQH, Jiomoranduin by, ?.:r* Q* ff. Barnes.The chief item in. the above is of course the evacuation by tho Admiralty of tho.rooms in tho how &quot;building at Gt,George Street and their occupation by the Board of Trade and the Board cf Education.     It was remitted to mo when I was engaged on other changes.Before saying anything further about tho Gt.Goorgo - Street changes, &apos;I -want to deal, however, with the question of aeeonmodation for-tho Ministry of Transport, which was also in the remit.     I want to diBon-t.ang.lo it from tho, 4t. George Streot building and the Board of Trade because tho transfer of the latter cannot be-made in tine for present requirements of- the Transport.-   It is intended now that tho staff of tVu/lattcr should occupy tho Board of Trade-offiocs as those arc vacated by the last mentioned Department.   Host of the section&apos;of the now building,, however, which is to bo- occupied by the Board of Trade is now occupied by the Office ofWorks and the Ministry of Health. Two shifts have to be made at least and in some cases three, &quot;before the Board of Trade rooms are available for Transport.   But tho Transport Kinistry want immediate possession and it must bo close to Whitehall Gardens unless they can be njiven a building elsewhere big enough   to houso the wholo Ministry.   There isno such building except Cornwall House, but, as I understand, that has boon rejected by the Minister.-   When the matter was referred to me, the Central Hall was mentioned;   but that is not now I available.   The best thing is to $ot possession of space close tothe Transport headquarters and sufficient for the number required for the first three months to start the Ministry, and then.lot them flow over into the Board of Trade offices as those arc later on/
. i 53vacated.   The  Central Buildings&apos; were suggested, &quot;but were found tih be unsuitable, besides we have to clear out of those premises in four months, so the best thing is to leave the present staff of the shipping Controller undisturbed.   I suggested the Lake Buildings, together with fuller use of Montagu House forecourt and some huts at the back.   Sir iric geddes rejected the Lake Buildings as being too far away:.   The best I can get is at the back of their present accommodation, with additional rooms at Ho.&apos; 3   4, which together accommodate over 200.   It consists of hutments in the rear of Whitehall Gardens, one room and conference room at Mo. 3, and in about ten days&apos; time, nine rooms in the top floor of three and four Whitehall Gardens,   All the above have convenient oovered access to Ho.      5 &amp; 6.   By this arrangement &quot;the Minister of Transport can have accommodation for his starting staff of 423, and as the staff further expands, it can flow over into Ho. 7 next door, the present Board of Trade offices.   That is the best that I can do in the case of the Transport, and is the beat anywhere about Whitehall..How I come to the new Building in Great George strret. It. has already been decided that the Admiralty should move out   and the Board of Trade and education  move in..  But to effect the change is not really so simple as it looks.,  pirst as has been said, the Admiralty is not exclusively occupying the parts allocated to the Board of Trade and education Department.   The Admiralty have as a matter of fact got about a third- of the Board of Trade part, the other part is occupied mainly but net wholly by the Office of &quot;;orks.   Before the Board %t Trace can get in therefore, th erc has\ to b e two *fci f t s.Of course if we could&apos;bundle the Admiralty out tomorrow the whole process of re-allocation could be expedited.   But we cannot.   There are eighteen hundred of a staff, spread all over the building, with the exception of the Ministry nt Health part, and the office of Works tell me that the evacuation would occupy two months, even with the co-operation of the Admiralty and if there was accommodation elsewhere.   It is fair to say that this estimate was reduced to six weeks by Sir Charles Ruthen but the six weeks is again    dependent upon: co-operation,.. good will and
t- 3 ma place to put them in.   But now there comes another difficulty,. There is no such place.   There is no single building available for eighteen hundred of a staff anywhere.   And even if there were, I would not reoommeno taking thera to it,   It is a diminishing staff, I would not make them so comfortable a3 to unduly lengthen their life in present numbers,,   odds and ends of temporary accommodation is all they need.   That I propose to give them concurrently with their partial -absorption into the main building of the Admiralty, to which they belong,The First lord has agreed to expedite their removal as far as   possible, having, in fact, undertaken to clear 87 rooms within the month and clear the whole of the staff by Christmas.   It is the ifOtrly moves, however, which arc, important, and in order to expedite those, I suggested to the Admiralty, after the Lake Buildings had been rejected by Sir iric, that they should take temporary possession of the vacant huts in the Park so as to expedite the second move., This I   understand they are willing to do.   It involves depriving the Shipping Controller of the use of those for the meantime, and it is well to remember in this connection, that his section in -4, Central Buildings, must clear., out in four months, and that they must then, as far as they are retained, rejoin him in-the Park; but I suggest the use of the vacant huts for the Admiralty Controller in the meantime,.   It may be possible to further expedite removal, although I am doubtful if we can much .improve upon the estimate ^iven above. But in order that, no chance may be lost, I have given instruc-tions for one of the floors of Cornwall House which are at present vacant, but which would ,require some wor&amp; to make them habitable, to be cleared and reserved for some little time. The floor is 36,000 fect area and would accommodate 500.
To sum up, I recommend(l)   Tho use/6f huts and rooms immediately adjacent to J k 6 Whitehall Gardens, by tho Ministry of Transport and tho use of No. 7, hy tho same, when,Hoj 7, is available.(2)   The clearance of the 87 rooms as per tho First Lord! e off or of tho Gt. George Street block.(3)   Tho expediting of further moves if possible by tho use of St. James&apos; Park hutB, and if necessary, by tho floor oCornwall House for such of&quot;-tho staff, if any, as can be used so far away from tho Admiralty.(4)   Tho use of the clearance of Gt. George Street by th  Ministry of Education and tho Board of Trade ao may bo mutually agreed.In connection with tho 1 alert point, the Board of Education donft want to move until there is room for a block cf about 4 0.    That will bo. in a fortnight.     On thn Board of Trade side, thoro are/sone rooms already vacant, and th^ Admiralty can give other 20 rooms in ton days.    There must, -however, bo a double shift in r-spact of about half of the latter,, as thoy arc at present occupied by the Office of Works, who will have to move into thoir o&quot;&apos;n block as the Admiralty move out.    The Office of &quot;forks now occupy a large part, I think about two-thirds, of tho Board of Trade Section, and will havo to move into their own territory as tho Admiral-tjr vacate it.It is this double shifting which is the cause, in part, of tho delay and confusion.    T7ith tho exception of      * the Ministry of Health soot ion, all the other Departments     * overlap one another, and tho Ministry of Health occupies part of the Board of Trade section.    But the move within this next few days ---ill give the Board of. Trade space for nearly 200 and the Board of Education about 42Q.    And, as there is space actually available now, the Board of Trade can make a start at any time.(Initialled)   G. 11. B.2 whitehall Gardens, 8.1,1, 25th August, 1919.
