(P 5216) From Viceroy, 2&amp;h August 1919;(Received 28th, 1.5 p.m.) 1233 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 20th August. There had not been yet sufficient time for our peace treaty to react on Afghanistan&apos;s relations with Bolsheviks. In any case, success of new policy will depend largely on our showing Afghanistan our confidence in her sincerity by allowing her sufficient time to clear up matters in her own way. Vital importance we attach to this subject was explained fully and emphatically to the Afghan delegates, and it would in oar opinion be a grave mistake to attempt to force the pace by addressing Amir now. Striking proof that Bolsheviks themselves are under no&apos; illusion as to the character of Afghanistan&apos;s late advances is given in the Chief of General Staft&apos; telegram to D.M.I., X. &quot;128, dated 20th August (I?)..
