This docnment is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government,/*(5.T. 805.1   VinWAR CABINET.THE DANGER TO ARMENIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a memorandum which I have received from the Russian authorities in Paris.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.-25th August, 1919.The Russian Embassy begs to draw the attention of His Britannic Majestys Government on the desperate situation of the Armenian population in the case of the proposed evacuation of the Caucasus by British armed forces. It appears from concordant information that Armenia, having recently refused to join the Tartar-Georgian League, is on the eve of a combined invasion by the Tartars of Azerbaijan, of the Georgians, of the Shahsavans and of the Turks. Regular Turkish troops are concentrated in the direction of Olty and Sarkamish. One division is in the region of ^having Khorasan and another in Sahart. Turkish officers are organizing Kurdish bands all along the frontier. There is no doubt that a general massacre of Armenians, whose small army would not be able to offer serious resistance, would follow the retreat of British troops.The Russian Government, which is unfortunately unable to help the Armenians, would be untrue to their secular tradition towards this unfortunate people if they did not address an urgent appeal to the feelings of humanity of the British Government, begging them to continue to defend the Armenians in the Caucasus against the menace ^ of the Turco-Tartars.(B19/S89)  70 8/19 ( H&amp;S  7435wo.
