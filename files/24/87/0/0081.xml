(Home Office)3peoial Report No. Q3ootland House3 *W&quot;, 1,30th August1919.(Ciroulated by the Home Seoretary)y&quot;\\   AM AMERICAN view OF CONGESTION AT THE DOCKS V\\         AND COtfSStpSNT SMAiJCiSMlflNT OF PRICES. Li-------0O0-------1 have lately had interviews with two Amerioan experts, the one on shipping and the other on the importation of Amerioan food.    The gist of their criticisms is that we are running up the cost of living in -England largely by our own fault.    Blame is not to be assigned to any particular class. In some of the ports the maohinery is antiquated, the transport is defioient as the railway does not oonneot with the docks, the shippers are negligent in not bringing their goods away, and labour 1b only working about fifty per cent of its pre-war standard and will not work overtime even in cases of emergenoy.    The oonsequenoe is that American ships are held up sometimes for thirty days, waiting for a berth. The oost of th$ demurrage is eventually loaded on to the consumer.    It would not be enough to remedy one or two of the defects;   if the overtime difficulty were to be overoome, the warehouses would still be congested through lack of transport or apathy on the part of the importer:   if there were admirable transport, and importers removed their good at onoe, there would still be delay in getting the oargo out of the holds.The shipment of cotton is a prime example.    There are now in the Mersey American ships loaded with ootton whioh are fifteenth, twentieth, and thirtieth for berthing aooommodation They will probably not be alongside for three weeks; and this delay has to be paid for by the consumer of ootton.    It is true that in recent bills of lading an option has been givenLIVERPOOL.to/
to send the shij to Manchester, where the dooks are provided with modem meohanioal appliances, but the berthing accommodation at Manchester is now full.    In Liverpool the machinery is antiquated, and in some of the dookB there is no direot communication with the railway; everything has to be carried by lorry and handled twice.The case of the s.s. &quot;iSngelwood&quot;, whioh waa mentioned in my weekly report yesterday, was cited as an example of the tendenoy of dook labourers to Mslaok&quot;.    When the ship was brought alongside, thirty-two men were put to salve the oargo, In pre-war days they would have discharged 75 tons in a morning.    They actually disoharged 36, and in spite of every inducement offered to them, they refused to work on the 3aturday afternoon or Sunday.The meohanioal appliances for handling ooal, not only from the ship but for delivery at private houses in London, are said to be very antiquated as compared with Amerioa, where the steam grab is exclusively used.    The oase of Chicago was cited, where, by this means, a ship carrying 10,000 tons was disoharged normally in four hours.    In delivering at private houses, instead of employing two men with eaoh wagon to tip ooal from a sack, in Amerioa every house is provided with a steel ohute, and tip wagons are used whioh discharge direotly into the ohute, the shovel being employed to oleon up the remainder.-TIMBER.It was pointed out that whereas timber was usually handled in this country by the single baulk, in Amerioa a timber wagon is provided with rollers and a winch, and the whole load is disoharged in one pieoe.I was told that as long as we oould get labour at 30s. Od
a week, anci ooal at 20a. Od a ton, it did not matter muoh whether one had modem machinery or not.    The rise in the oost of labour and the diminution of its effioienoy has altered the whole position, and if the present high prioes are to be reduoed, it is not enough to have increased production, one must have meohanioal effioienoy as well.    It was suggested to me that it would pay any of the Dock Authorities to employ an effioienoy expert to report  upon their plant.    Further, that the question of the modernising of maohinery of suoh importanoe to the welfare of theoommunity as dook maohinery, should be taken up toy the Government itself, for my informants believed that if this were done, quite apart from any influenoe that may be brought to bear upon labour, there would at onoe be an appreciable fall in the oost of living, and we should not be running the risk of having our imports out off in favour of markets where ships were not so long delayed.It was also suggested that in oonneotion with the oall for private as well as publio economy, the Government should prohibit the importation of what are obviously luxuries until all the shipping and dook spaoe required for necessities has been oleared.B.H.T.
