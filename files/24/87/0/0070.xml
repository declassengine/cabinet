Not3 by the Acting Secretary.With reference to the accompanying Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Chancellor of the Exchequer approves the proposed terms of reference for the Imperial Sea Communications Committee.     He asks, however, to be allowed to nominate a Treasury representative to serve, on the Committee.   Money,, he thinks, will certainly be involved and it is desirable that the Treasury should be able to follow the discussions:.(Signed)     THOMAS JOHBS.Acting Secretary.2 Whitehall Gardens, &amp;.1. 29th August, 1&amp;19.
IMPERIAL, SEA OOHiMIOATIOMS. Memorandum by,the. Secretary of State for the Colonies.The War Cabinet, at a Meeting on Wednesday, August 13th, decided that the terms of reference to the Committee, whioh is to consider the question of. the improvement of sea communications between different parts of the Empire, should be settled by the Shipping Controller, the President of the Board of Trade and myself, and should be shown to the Chancellor of the Exohequer before publication;   also that we should decide upon the representatives of the United Kingdom on this Committee.I accordingly had a meeting with Sir Joseph Maolay and Sir Auckland Go&amp;des on this subject at the Colonial Office on Wednesday last, August 20th.With regard to the terms of reference, we thought it best to follow the Resolution of the Imperial War Conference of 1918, which proposed the appointment of an Imperial Investigation 3o-:ird;&quot;To enquire into and report on all matters connected with ocean freights and facilities and on all matters connected with the development and improvement of the sea communications between the different parts of the Snpire with special reference to the size and type of ships and the capacities of harbours.&quot;The Committee nov/ being set up is virtually the Imperial Investigation Board under another name.     In a memorandum pre-pared by the Board of Trade, and sent out to the self-governing Dominions on the 9th December, 1918, the terms of reference to the above mentioned Board were further defined and Get oat with greater precision..    The proposals of this -memorandum have been approved by all the Dominions, and we therefore agreed that they should constitute the terms of reference to the Committee.   They are as follows:-(1) Freights, Facilities and Conditions of Transport..To enquire into complaints from persons and bodies interested with regard to ocean freights, facilities and conditions in the Inter-Imperial trade or questions of a similar nature referred to them b,y any of the nominating authorities, end- to report their conclusions to the Governments concerned.(2) Imperial Oo;jmunioations*tTo survey the facilities for maritime transport on such routes as appear to them to be necessary fos trade within the Empire, and to make recommendations to the proper authority for the co-ordination and improvement of such facilities with regard to the type, size and speed of ships, depth of water in &amp;ooks or channels, construction of harbour works and similar i matters.With regard to the composition of the Committee we decided -s.jain following tn  principle though not in every detail the lines laid down for the Imperial Investigation Board - that the Committee should consist of *?n independent Chairman appointed by
the Cabinet., of 8 official members nominated by the Colonial Office, India Office&apos;, Board, of Trade,, and the 5 Dominions, and of 5 unofficial members, experienced in shipping and commerce, appointed by.the Board of Trade,The President of the Board of Trade has undertaken to find the 5 unofficial members above referred to.   There will., no doubt, be no difficulty about  the representatives of the Colonial&apos; Office, India Office end Bo&amp;rd of Trade, and I am in comrauiiicstion with the Dominions, some of whom have already appointed their members.Two things remain to be done.   The Cabinet decided that the ter..:S of reference should be submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,   Before finally deciding upon thorn, therefore, they ou^ht to bo sent to him for approval. &quot;:e-h?.ve also still to decide upon a Chairman for the Committee, Various n;-mes were discussed at the meeting between Sir Joseph -liaclay, Sir Auckland Geddes and myself, but no decision was arrived at - indeed we think that this point is of such importance, that it can only be decided by the Cabinet itself.MILKER.23rd August, 1919.
