277Worn Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 31st August 1919. (Received 8 a.m., 1st September.)Clear the line.1274 H. Secret. Afghanistan. We are still without news from British Agent, Kabul. Chief Afghan delegate assured Grant meeting peace conference (vide our iplegram of 27th July, 109 B.S.) that he was safe and well and undertook to forward letter to him, and at last meeting (vide our telegram of 9th August, 1157 S.) that Grant&apos;s letter had been duly delivered. No reply, however, has been received and assumption is either that something untoward has happened to him or that all correspondence from him and his staff is being rigorously suppressed. As rumours of &quot;anything untoward could hardly have failed to reach us, probability is corraspon-dence is being suppressed to prevent our learning true state of Afghanistan before things settle down again on peace footing.Position is so intolerable that still letter has been sent to the Foreign Minister under our Foreign Secretary&apos;s signature to the effect that we will not repatriate Afghan detenu or evacuate Dakka until British Agent&apos;s safe return or recipt of explanation inhis own handwriting of his delay.
