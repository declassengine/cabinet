Venizelos, who was then Premier, favoured the free expression of thought and even protected the formation of syndicates; and the attempts of the reactionaries who followed him to suppress syndicalism only suooeeded in inoreasing its strength.    The.study of Sooial questions had already begun to attract the attention of intellectuals and from 1915 onwards, the adherents to the dootrines of Marx showed a considerable increase.    The membership of the smaller Syndioates, which had been established in various industrial centres rapidly grew larger, until there was a general demand from all Independent Syndioates for the constitution of a oentral organisation.The tforkmerfs Federation of Salonika, whioh had existed for some years, and which had already declared its adherenoe to the International Federation of Trades Unions at Amsterdam, set the example by federating all the isolated Syndioates in the district around Salonika and throughout Hecedonia.    Two deputies of the Greek Parliament offered their services to this new Federation,and/
ana others started later to negotiate for th* oreatlon of a central organisation for Athena and the Piraeus.Vp till this time, the aim of the Syndicates had been, purely, eaonomio, but henoeforth .they began to assume a political aspaot.Two National Congresses were held in November 1918, representatives from the different Sooidlist organisations meeting at Athens and Piraeus.   The members at eaoh Congrest adopted the teachings of Marx as their programme and deoidei on the orention of the Sooialist Party of Greece, whose administrative committee beoame a Parliamentary group,It was also deoided to draw up a Constitution for the General Confederation of Greek workmen, whioh incorporated all the Industrial and Agricultural Unions of Greeoe under one head, and subsequently, the Sailors and Dook labourers, who grouped themselves in Syndicates and joined the Central Organisation.In addition the Congress deoided to participate officially in the elections.   Weekly papers were founded at Athens, Piraeus and other oentres, and daily papers at Athei and Salonika. (In June 1919, the 3ooialist Party went one step furthei and openly deolared its adherence to the third International In six years, therefore, Socialism in Greece has made rapid strides.The results of the two national Congresses whioh were held in November 1918, soon began to make themselves felt, for shortly afterwards strikes broke out at Athens and Piraeus, whose aims were to foroe the Government to adopt fi different home polioy.   On this occasion the Government, after making many arrests, deoided to yield to the requests of the strikers.   During the recent strike movement, however the./
(SpeoiaH)the. Government adopted an entirely/different policy and deoided to resist, by every means in their power,any; attempt to achieve political aims by the process of &quot;Direct Action&quot;.On July 18th, the Government arrested the four leaders of the General Confederation of Greek Workmen for threatening a general strike-and deported them to Crete,Benaroya, one of the leaders of the General Confederation is a Bulgar Jew from Salonika, where in 1910 he worked for the Bulgar Committees and was closely watohed by the Turks. He is a notorious agitator.   All four leaders were:, ejected from the combined Workers Union1 this Spring, and; then founded their present organisation, whioh purposes to copy the French Confederation Generale du Travail.The editor of the Socialist paper,&quot;Rizospastis&quot;, was /also arrested, but not deported.   Through the Military Governor, the; Government also informed the employees of the Tramway and Eleotrio Companies, the Postmen and. the Railwaymen, that, as they were mobilised and consequently on. Military Service, any meetings held by them would be considered as mutiny and render them liable to the penalties laid down by martial law.The General Confederation thereupon, elected anew Executive and addressed a strong protest to the Government, demanding an 8 hour day and the reduction of food prioes, within ten days, by 50$.   If their demands were not accepted they threatened a general strike..&quot;&apos;.*A delegation, whioh was reoeived by the Minister of Communications, met with some suooess at first, the latter, it is alleged, having strong sympathies with the socialists. M. Hepoulis, the acting Premier, however, made it olearthat/
*ml 4 -(Special)that he did. not intend to yield to threats., On tluly 21st matters took a different turn, and a partial general strike began, involving printers, waiters, ,  tramwaymen, postal employees, railwaymen. and the aleotrlo Company&apos;s men.   The hew Executive of the General Confederat of Workmen demanded a 50$ reduction of prices, ah 8 hour day for all workers, the abolition of the censorship and the release of the leaders, whose arrest was given as the reason for the general strikealthough the proposed international strike was probably a contributing Cause.Kie Government decided to take drastio military aotion and by the end of,the day succeeded in running some trains and, trams, with-the assistance of the Military and those whtj feared to strike.   Public opinion generally was against the workmen-and the profeprimal o3.asses talked of. a counter-strike. &apos; On&apos;. July; 22nd the movement, which. already showed signs of weakening, was given its death blow, by the arrest of the new Exeoutive of the General Confederation, and the. order of the Military Governor, giving all mobilised- workers! 24 hours to return to work;By. the evening of the 22nd July, %h&amp;. General Confederation, had deoided to issue a proclamation saying that, as a result exf consultation with the Government, the strike had ended;   The collapse of., the strike may be said to be entirely due to the strong aotion of M. RepOulis, the acting premier, who had reoeived instructions from M. Venizelos to the effeot that the movement was to be put down at all oosts.
