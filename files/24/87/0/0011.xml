HIS XKTOMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITABTIO MAJESTY&apos;3 MMJMMl)WAR   OABII-TETREPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE PEAOfe CONFERENCE APPOINTED TO CONSIDER THE ORGANIZATION &apos;)F THEREPARATION CQLLIISSIGN.jH:te by Sir H* Llewellyn Smith). *The Report of the Sub-Csmmittee cn the organisation Of the Reparation Cr.mmi3Ki?n (G.T.7907) proposes that the same Sub-Committee, (rr, as it is entitled in the Report, the same &quot;Division&quot;), 3hould deal with reparation in the matter cf coal and chemicals.   This appears t-o fe an impossible proposition, tt which we should offer most strenuous opposition.   The i,eeh-nical knowledge required by the Coal Division is absolutely different from that required tc Seal with synthetic dyes and drugs, and it is quite impossible that the same set of technical experts could handle both questions.   The Board r?f Tirade had S9 confidently assumed that there would be separate Sub-Committees to deal with these two matters, that they had actually considered the names of suitable British Representatives to be placed upon the two bodies.   The question f*f dyestuffo is if vital importance to Great Britain and it is proposed to suggest the name of Lord Maulten as cur Representative on this Sub-Committee.   It is quite out ef the question to suppose that lord Moulton would undertake also      deal with coaii    It is alsi proposed in the Report that the same Division sh&amp;uld deal with merchant shipping and cables, and we are consulting the Ministry of Shipping as to whether this would be practicable and desirable.Another matter arising from the Report is the proposal in paragraph (f) of &quot;General   Principles&quot; that &quot;the principle should be established that nn national er^anisati^n has the rijht to send any mission or emissary into enemy countries.   Any missions sent out must ro as the mandatory cf the Reparation Commission as a whole&quot;.   It seems to be quite impossible to enforce a paragraph of this kind/ and if it stands, it is highly probable that Great Britain would be the only Power which would give effect ta it.   It should, therefore, be emitted.    (Imagine M. Loucheur being restrained by such a paragraph from sending French emissaries into Germany!)(Sgd)   H. LLEYKLLYN SMITH.16th August, 19i9.EGRET . 8011.i &quot;7%
