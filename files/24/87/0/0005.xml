COPY^OFTlREPORT ON THE CONDITIONS IN BUDAPEST RECEIVED from .M.F.MR, NOEL BUXTOti BY SIR WILLIAM GOODE, BRITISH DIRECTOR of relief MISSIONS.AUGUST 14th. 1919.oOo -I visited Budapest at the request of Mr* Butler, headof the British Food Mission at Vienna, in order to report to him on the shortage of hospital supplies. Our Missionconsisted of 5 persons including 2 dootors. We arrived by train on August 5th. a few hours after the Roumanian troops occupied the town, shortly before the Armistice terms were presented.  We le ft immediately after the- coup d*etat which was announced on- the morning of August 7th. Though on Official mission we were refused permission to leave by train, and we travelled by private oar to Vienna.The situation in regard to food and hospital supplies ^was extremely urgent, and was greatly aggravted by the peculiar political situation from which It is impossible to dissociate the question of relief.The following points; specially affecting the position of the Allies; came into prominences-Distress.a.  Shortage of Food - This has he come- acute^ through the cumulative effeotsi of the War, the subsequent blockade, and the difficulty experienced by Budapest of purchasing food from the peasants with Bolshevist Government Notes known as &quot;white money&quot;. The shortage became a famine through the interception of all traffic entering the city by the Roumanians. G k* Hospital shortage - The hospitals were in dire necessityowing iffy the already most inadequate supplies of milk etc. being suddenly cut off; a great number of the patients were undoubtedly faced with death in consequence.
liany hospitals on August 7th had no supplies to go om with at all. The Roumanians were the cause of this, and their conduct in. regard to hospital stores was still more flagrant. For instance, 4 truck loads of medical stores, sent by;Kb.sutler and the International Hospital Committee at Vienna were taken otoer by the Roumanians.   It was obviously unsafe for Kr. Butler to proceed with the despatch: of supplies, which were in readiness at Vienna, so that a total absence of hospital necessaries followed./To give an instance of the result severe operations had to be performed without proper anaesthetics.The hospital administration was further paralysed by the stoppage of traffic, effected by a oorden drawn through the centre of the town from Worth to South. Owing to this the outpatient departments on August 6th were practically empty.The rights of the Allies under the Armistice of Nov. 1918. to utilize transport, were ignored.11K plunder. The requisition of food was in full swing, the troops themselves requiring large supplies, quite apart from the stores which were being despatched to Roumania.We saw Roumanian soldiers driving quantities, of cattle along the streets, and many Army waggons removing stocks of grain or flour. From a farmi belonging to one of the hospitals the live stock was forcibly removed.Among the points repeated to us, which of course we could not verify, but which, I understand to be recognised by Allied officers to be true, was the despatch to Roumania of quantities of farming implements, motor cars, sewing machines, and machinery from factor-iea. Telephone appcratus was removed from private houses.Even if the Allies maintain their right to forbid the imposit-ion of any terms by the Roumanian Government, the security of the Powers for the reparation due to them from Hungary has been largely prejudiced, r-.nd is further injured every day that the Roumanian army remains in the country.
It may easily prove not only that Hungary may require to receive food for the coming year, which would have been supplied&apos; by lis own harvest, but the prevention of sowing arrangements will necessitate Allied relief during the year 1920 - 21 also. 111. Violence9The loss of life which General Gorton has reported waa confirmed by a great deal of evidence, and it is ok course quiteinevitable that a Balkan State, animated by revenue, will be responsible for the prevalence of atrocities of the worst kind In the villages*The change from a Bolshevist Government to a Socialist Govern-ment, which was in progress with Allied help, would have meant the expulsion of many Red nominees from the public of floes-, but this took a violent form under the influence of the anarchy caused by the total suppression of Hungarian authority, and by the real or supposed encouragement of antl-bolshevist excesses by the partisans of the &quot;whites&apos;&apos;&apos; acting; under Roumanian protection.It was said that many hundreds were killed in the suburbs, and English residents were convinced of this by the eye witness of Hungarian friends.Violence was also prevalent in the centre^ of the town and even in Government buildings, to such an extent that 1 myself on entering a section of the War Office along with a British Officer, Major Maclean, saw a suspected Bolshevist being brutally battered, while actually in the hands of the official guards, who by this time were all nominees of the &quot;white&quot; party.The Englishmen,   in Budapest thought that pogroms of the Galiclara Jews, who were regarded as responsible; for Bolshevism, were probable owing to the total absences of Allied troops *As an example) of the outrages committed, it was established that a woman, on whom a Roummlan private waa billited, was killed by him with the bayonet, on her complaining of his dirty habits.
If the change of G-cvornment had been effected with the ijicluslon. of the foxw members of the former tkrvarnment supported by the Allied representatives in touch with Budapest, (namely - AgostonvJ&amp;oehm, Garami, and Haubrloh) the disorders would have been either absent or for less in degree than occured as the result of the chaos produced by the invasion.Points of a more distinctly political character appear to be ultimately of even greater importance,IV.The Damage to Hungarian Governmental Authority.Whatever Government may supervene, it will be regarded as a foreign creation, and want of confidence will naturally follow from foreign occupation, especially from occupation by a nation hitherto despised and admittedly less civilized. Such weakness connotes ultimate Bolshevism, V. Increased Arrogance of the Roumanian Government.This will result unless the Allies show their complete will end power to compel evacuation and to deprive Roumanian of any e?.im from the invasion.Prom my knowledge of governing personalities at Bucarest it seems a to me that the successful defiance of the Powers will fortify the dangerous factors.a. Much greater difficulty will be experienced in inducing Roumania to sign the treaty regarding the rigihts of minorities! tariffs, transit, etc,b. If the Bratianqj Government scores a brilliant success, its power to resist internal reform will be increased.c. The Partisans of an alliance with neighbouring states aimed at defying the Powers in regard to frontiers etc. will become dangerously influential.VI. Injury to the Prestige of the Powers0This may prove the chief significance of the crisis. The maintoinance of the prestige of the AJLlies? at this moment is essentail to the establishment of many effective: &quot;League of Nations.
It will be seen only-too-clearly&apos;&quot;&quot;that although the^gufr Is&quot; not technically established   the machinery forenforcing its decisions is present in even greater degree than willbe the case in normal times, and that the Powers, although theyeverhave as strong a motive as they will/have    for asserting their authority, are prevented, owing to diversions among themselves or to whatever cause, from following the procedure essential to any League which is more than a name.The Roumanians not only defied the Powers in advancing to- j -Budapest, but they submitted the Allies Representatives to studied insults *    Of this the following instances are examplesa. General Gorton was prevented from using the telegraph and telephone wires, and would have been isolated but for the American telephone provided by Mr Hoover *b. His request to make known to the   public the communication of the Allies received from Paris was refused.c. The right of the Allies to use the railways was denied on the hollow pretext that orders had been given that trains leaving Budapest should be fired upon, and that the order could not be revoked.    A British Officer on official duty was obliged to obtain a private ear and motor the whole distance to Viennadtf    When 1 general Gorton proposed to inform the Roumanian Commander of the telegram received from Paris, he was refused a hearing. British official opinion in Vienna strongly deplores theappearance   of success which the Roumanian defiance of the&apos; ifPowers has achieved, through the absence of anjr statementindicating the punishment which wil7 be inflicted on Roumania.The conduct of Roumania is natural to a Balkan State whosetraditions are the result of a long period of Turkish dominationand this Near Eastern mentality forms one of the main dangers which international organization hasto control,It is the willingness and capacity of the great States to-act firmly, which is essential to a solution, and which may prove to have been submitted by the Hungarian crisis to a critical test.
The Immediate physical compulsion not being proposed, and the desirability of hastening the departure of the Roumanian Army being admitted, the means of discrediting the Bratiano adventure, and giving material to his political opponents at Bucarest, appear to include the following statement of the Allies intention.1.    Severance of diplomatic relations and exoluslon from the Peace Conference.2.     Denial of priviliges enumerated under &quot;the Covenant * 3.     Stoppage of goods on the seas for Roumania. 4.     Refusal of loans. 5.      Tariff boycott.6&quot;.     Reconsideration of terrotorlal gains in Banat eto. ,and bridgeheads of South side of the Danube.7.     Heavier debts on territory acquired.8.     Reparation for all thefts and injuries and formoral damage caused by proposal to inflict Armistice terms.
