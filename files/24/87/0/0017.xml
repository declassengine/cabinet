Parliament has sanctioned help on a vast scrle for the housing programme.    It seems to me undesirable that in addition to the subsidy openly given in accordance with the provisions of the Housing Act concealed subsidies should be accorded in other ways.    If/therefore, hutments are to be made available.for&apos; local authorities, they should be sold or rented to them on terms which fairly represent their &quot;*value, but in deciding what the value ie I agree with the Minister.of,Health that we should iake into account the lower price   which would be obtained if large quantities of them were placed upon the market at once.i$)   i ought to add that great care must be exercised to protect the country against loss by,claims for additional injury to the property while the huts are used for housing purposes..J? R ET.8016.(Intd.)   A.0,Treasury S.W.August 18th. 4919.
