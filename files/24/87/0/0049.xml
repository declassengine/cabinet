(P. 5055)From Viceroy, 23rd August 1919. (Received 10.40 a.m.)Clear the line.1218 S. Afghanistan. As you are aware, Afghan delegates made % great point of our marked omission to address Amir as &quot; (? His Majesty).&quot; There is ho doubt that this omission caused grave offence from the start and its continuance will keep (? the) sore open (?thus) creating atmosphere unfavourable to our friendship policy. The&apos; fact that Afghan Government attach so great importance to recognition of this title by the King-Emperor is, in itself, a tacit admission of our&apos; paramount position in relation to Afghanistan, and it would be mistake to destroy this sentiment or to let any other Power obtain the goodwill of Afghanistan&apos; by recognising this title in anticipation of us. Indeed, speedy recognised -nition of this title by us will be first step towards gaining informal and friendly control of Afghanistan&apos;s foreign relations that we desire and hope for. If Amir Amanulla makes good, we shall in any case have sooner or later to accord title which was recognised in Dane&apos;s treaty, and there is no object in keeping him and Afghan Government in a state of irritation on this small point. Let us, therefore, make a fair start. It is possible that I may shortly receive letter from him, and it would be awkward after, what Afghan delegates said both formally, and privately to Grant in the most friendly fashion, for me again markedly to omit the title. There need be no publication of the fact. Title would merely be (? introduced), (? as) heretofore, in my letters. I earnestly trust that His Majesty the King-Emperor may be moved to sanction this without delay.
