From Viceroy, Foreign Department, Id September 1919. (Received 2nd at 8.30 a.m.)Clear the line.1278 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 28tli August last. Our telegraphic summary of Afghan delegates&apos; feelings regarding Amir&apos;s title failed to convey their real feeling in the matter. Delegates made it quite clear that our omission to use title rankled not as withholding of a favour but as studied insult. It was this that forced Grant at the last moment to (? expunge) all personal reference to Amir in draft treaty, as Afghan delegates flatly refused to sign treaty unless it embodied what they regarded as his proper title. They themselves use title as a matter of course. It was used throughout the party after the sign(ing) of treaty, which being open to public was reported verbatim in Press. Thus prospect of our eventual recognition of title will in no sense act as a bribe. Indeed, our own very decided view is my immediate use of the title, always provided Amir addresses me in terms sufficiently friendly, will (? considerably) ease the resumption of negotiations and make him more amenable before,, during and after them. We have staked everything on our new policy of mutual confidence and we shall be severely handicapped indeed if this all-essential preliminary courtesy were denied us.
