12 Are&apos;-   &apos;na 0   63This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.-........ Gen, No. 16&quot; 4236WAR CABINET.LIQUIDATION OF WAR WORK BY GOVERNMENTDEPARTMENTS.I circulate herewith a Memorandum by the Quartermaster-General on the above subject.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.20th August, 1919.The exact scope of the transactions of the Liquidation Board proposed by Sir Auckland Geddes (War Cabinet G.T. 7519) is not quite clear, but if this Board is confined to the liquidation of work &quot; entered into for the purposes of the war &quot; (Clause I., line 4, of draft Bill), i.e., work not normally undertaken in peace time by any department, it would not appear that the War Office is directly concerned. The Ministry of Munitions would appear to be the department principally affected.2. From the general point of view, however, the following points suggest themselves : (a.) Section 3 (3) of the Bill provides that &quot;the Board may by notice published in the Gazette fix in respect of any transactions or class of transactions a date after which ho further claim against the Crown in respect thereof shall be valid.&quot; It appears a strong measure to confer upon a public department an absolute discretion to anticipate by administrative order the operation of the Statute of Limitations.If the Statute of Limitations is to be anticipated, it would be preferable that it were done directly by the legislature rather than by administrative order.. The Bill which the Inter-Departmental Committee, set up by the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet (G.T. 7297) is engaged in drafting will, I ^understand, if enacted bar all claims against the Crown arising out of or in connection with the war unless presented within twelve months from the termination of the war or from the date on which such claims arise, whichever is the longer period. This appears adequate. But if it is not, the more convenient method would appear to be to modify the Bill  not to supplement it by granting powers under another Bill to the proposed Liquidation Board.(&amp;.) I am inclined to the opinion that it is unsound from an administrative point of view that the Treasury, which&apos;is responsible for the exercise of economy by Government Departments in general and for the general supervision of expenditure, should itself become a spending department.(c.) If the formation of such a Board as is proposed can be proved to be essential or even desirable in the public interest, it should be placed under the Ministry of Munitions when it could be linked up with the Disposals Board. The liquidation of past transactions will frequently involve a decision as to whether materials, &amp;c, should be taken over by the department or left with the contractor as part of the consideration for the cancellation of the contract; and for this reason alone, among others, it is essential that there should be the closest possible touch between any Liquidation Board and the Disposals Board. The best way of securing this would seem to be to place both Boards under the supreme direction of the same Minister. At the same time, to secure this object by the Board of Liquidation taking over the Disposals Board, as paragraph 3 of page 2 of Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; memorandum suggests might ultimately be done, is a step which would seem to require some consideration. Once the Disposals Board has got into its swing, it would seem to be inviting dislocation and chaos to transfer it to a \ 1 q    new department.(cl.) Liquidation of any business requires accurate knowledge of preceding transactions, and nothing is likely to delay liquidation more than transferring it from the hands of the production department formerly concerned with the business to a new(B19/370) 70&quot; 8/19 H&amp;S 7408wo
staff who have no previous experience of the work in question, which may be of a highly technical nature. The procedure envisaged under Clause 3(2) would seem to lead in practice to interminable misunderstandings and delays.(e.) The above remarks are made on the assumption that the creation of a Board of Liquidation is a necessity. It is not perhaps strictly within my province to deal with this aspect of the question, but I should like to make the following observations.If on the liquidation work of any department being taken over by this Board the department in question were ipso facto to cease to exist, whatever the other drawbacks of this procedure might be, there would be an undoubted economy in staff, &amp;c. But if, as experience would tend to show, these moribund departments continue to exist in an emasculated condition for the purpose of &quot;feeding &quot;the Board of Liquidation,there would undoubtedly be an increase, rather than a decrease, in the total staff employed.There is a constant criticism on the part of the public against the growth of old and the formation of new public departments. The public have already been told that the Ministry of Munitions are conducting the business of liquidation of their own contracts and the disposal of surplus property. The only conclusion which a large number of people will draw from the formation of this &quot; super &quot; Board is that the departments concerned are incapable of liquidating, or unwilling to. liquidate their contracts and demobilize their staff, and that therefore the taxpayer must support another department to see that they do their work properly, with every chance of a super-super Board being created to watch the super Board, and so ad infinitum. marquis custodiet ipsos custodes ? It may be a mistaken point of view, but it is not entirely an unreasonable one.Generally speaking, the departments themselves concerned&apos; are the best fitted to liquidate the transactions into which they themselves have entered. If any department is incapable of completing its liquidation work satisfactorily or with sufficient rapidity, the true remedy is for a supreme authority, e.g., the Cabinet, to insist on the department setting its house in order, winding up all its outstanding contracts, &amp;c., and demobilizing a given percentage of its staff by a fixed date. It is, however, no use to demobilize- the staff first before the business is completed; that entails confusion, delay and generally the ultimate replacement of the staff by a new staff without the experience of the old.T. C, .Quartermaster-General to the Forces,6th August, 1919.
