Althoughthe potato &quot;crop is keeping fairly fpoe from blight, it is much affected by the complete absence or moisture, which has chocked tho growth of [foliage and caused yellowing of the stalks on many fields.   It is reported from County Mayo that although tho season is not favourable Ito tho devolopnvnt of blight, the advantages.of two or three applica-tions of the spraying mixture, as against a single spraying, arecjuite apparent.Pastures are greatly &quot;burned up&quot;, and in many counties milch Icows are suffering in condition and the yield of milk is consequently bry low.Mis FOR AGRICULTURAL BEflBBBffi-mam mwv-mm^ of fm ass-FAHfi LABOUR.There.is no change in the situation regarding the strikes inCounties( 13/8/19.
