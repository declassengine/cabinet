(Memorandum by the 3-resident of the Board of Agriculture and- Fioheries)The Board of Agriculture have already considerable financial relationships with the two Universities as ce&quot;ntres for Agricultural &quot;Education and Research.The Agricultural School at Cambridge is as regards personnel, material, and the quality of the work accomplished, the leading school in the country and the chief centre of training of agricultural teachers and experts, especially of the scientific exnerts who take service with Indian and colonial governments or the large tropical planting organisations.   The bchool has been maintained almost entirely from grants from the Board of Education and small grants from neighbouring County Councils, without any contribution from general university funds;   also the chief Trofessorship is paid by grants from the Drapers&apos; Company.   The Board of Agriculture nor propose to increase their annual grant to -p,5,000.   In addition the University through the School of Agriculture is responsible for the two Institutes for Research in Animal nutrition and Plant Breeding, which are financed by grants from the Board (Development Fund) amounting to about  4,500 oer annum, and it is proposed to provide a grant for research on the breeding of small domestic animals e.g. rabbits and poultry during the five year period commencing 1st October, 1919.The school of ^ural &quot;&quot;conomy at Oxford is on a smaller scale and has been re-organised during the war.   It will receive an annual grant of &quot;3,000 from the Board.   The university is also responsible for the Institute of Research in Agricultural Economics which is to become the operative centre of the work of the Agricultural Costings Committee.   This Institute at present receives an annual grant from the Board of about &quot;2,000 per annum.She Board are further interested in the land held by the Universities and the Colleges.   They administer the Universities and College  &quot;states Acts, and their approval is necessary for all sales, purchases and exchanges of land and the raising of loans for improvements.   For some time past the Board have been unofficially interesting themselves in the management of university and College Estates.   They have taken part in meetings both in Oxford and Cambridge which discussed a proposal for the foundation of an estate office in each university to which the colleges and university would entrust the technical management of the various estates without interfering with the personal responsibilities of the bursars. The pro-nosed office would in fact replace commercial firms of land agents now employed by the bursars.   The Board strongly support this proposal believing that thereby considerable improvement can be effected in .the management of College estates and also that the proposed office can play a most important part in the professional training of graduates of the Agricultural School.   The Scheme seems likely to be started in Cambridge but no progress has been made in Oxford.The Board agree wither. Fisher&apos;s proposals (G.T. 7874) for a Royal Commission and would ask that these facts should be borne in mind in nominating the members of the Commission.21st August, 1919.L of F.
