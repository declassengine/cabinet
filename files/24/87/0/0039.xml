I?July 21st.   Secret.Mai an showed me on July 18th a delayedtelegram just received, sent by General Botha before he sailed.    Botha asked for my support with reference to incorporation of Swaziland as to which he said he was in negociation0    Malan said that. Botha wanted he thought to carry through incorporation at the October Peace Session^    I urged delay and told Malan I should greatly deprecate any endee;v our to force this-matter without proper opportunity for representations on the part of the Swazis, and for consideration,    I leave to-day for Rhodesia,    Before he sailed I asked Botha by telegraph whether there was any reason for again, postponing my visit in order that we might meet.    He replied in the negative,    I shall not see-him lor^ome weeks but I have sent Malan and him short private unofficial memorandum.    Its gist is- shortly^a&amp;J^follow^:&apos; Beginse   I recognised that it would be difficult for His Majesty ls Government to refuse whenever -Union-Go-vora-* nient requested incorporation of Swaziland, though the - -terms of such- incorporation and. moment- at which it should take place must necessarily be matters for con-sideration and discussion,,    Imperial Parliament in conformity with pledge given&apos;in 1909 must be afforded full opportunity of considering matter before transfer actually took place0    Incorporation I agreed-had to come&apos;probable..explanation being that Botha, wag in Iingland.and probably before long, but expressed-surprise that I should not have been approached in the first, instance^ the
I proceeded that moment was not in my opinionexpedient for&apos;-raising question.   Further that such question should not be decided and announced without giving adequateopportunity to white settlers and to natives to state their case, and adequate time to -explain reason for incorporationto the natives.   Swazis were at present strongly opposed toincorpoiation and looked with grave misgivings upon sucha future,see my despatch of June 16 No.422,though I thoughtthese apprehensions might be modified or overcome if timegiven to prepare the Swazi and to explain to them the? schemesecurity provided under Schedule for their lands and liberty.It appeared to me to put His Majesty&apos;&quot;s Government in a false position arid open to the charge of bad faith if it was suddenly announced without preliminary pour-parlers with natives that His Majesty:s Government had agreed with the Government of Union; kotith Africa for in-corporation of territory.   This would be unfair to natives. Also better for future relations between Union and natives that imminence of incorporation should be broken to them gradually.It was true that Swazis were told by Lord Seljjotrae in 1909 that they would at some time come under Union but it had I thought always been contemplated that if&apos; and when question arose they would be given an opportunity of stating their case. . When visiting Swaziland in September 1917 (see my despatch of December 5th 1917 Ho.786, T had told the Bwazi Chiefs and the Chief Regent that when question of incorporation was raised afresh they would have due notice of any proposals and that they would have full opportunity of expressing their views.
I added in conclusion that apart from the question as particularly affecting the Swazis moment was not in my opinion propitious to carry out incorpora-tion of a native territory.    ivluch unrest among natives in Union which had extended to Protectorates special feeling of suspicion and alarm in regard to Native Land Bill.    I felt certain that if just now a nativo territory were transferred from direct control of Crown to Union this alarm and unrest would he greatly accentuated.    Nationalist agitation for independence had. also greatly alarmed natives as foreshadowing withdrawal of Imperial protection altogether 0 ,In Basutoland  the other day I had found strong feeling on above linesB   Feared that trouble would ensue in Swaziland itself and that effect on natives would be bad in Basutolaud and elsewhere *   As well as being most unfortunate from the point of viow of the prestige of the Union it would be very embarrassing to His Majestyfs Government if incorporation were followed immediately by native unrest in Swaziland itself oralsewhere.   Ends.The ingrained suspicion and fear of a Dutch GoveiTinont among natives in the Protectorates as well as the Union is the fundamental difficulty but this of course could not be stated In the memorandum.BUTTON.
PARAPHRASE TELEGRAI.il from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for South Africa.(Sent 12,20 p,m. 21st Au-sust, 1919)SECRET.With reference to your secret telegram of July 21st regarding Swaziland both Smuts and Botha spoke to ne several times before their departure on this subject,   rlhey are very keen about incorporation.    I have been trying to send you a des-patch on the subject but have been prevented by fearful pressure of general public business during past month.    I fully realise strength of your objections whicn no doubt will weigh with Ministers.   Meanwhile I should like to put before you some con-siderations on the other side.I was always opposed personally to exceptional treat-ment of Swaziland which in my judgment is wholly unlike BasutolancU   Basutoland I hope may remain autonomous native state always.    In Swaziland   external conditions and native capacity far less favourable for self-government,  Y/hite settle-nent is important and is bound to grow, and country is insepar-able economically from adjoining districts of Transvaal.   As sum-ing as I ao that ultimately scheduled territories will come under Union by tar the best to begin with is Swaziland.   Botha tells me he has no intention at present of asking for transfer of Basutolsno, or Becnuanaland and I think he  understands perfectly that unless Union Government can make a success of handling of native question in Swaziland, the transfer even, of Bechuanaland to Union wjj.1 be deferred indefinitely.    His o^n ide^s as to treatment of natives in which I believe he&apos;is sincere seem to me liberal and quite on right lines.    Of course you will have to sstisiy yourself that he is likely to be able to carry them jut. --Tf-Ah- j.s the present is I believe as good an opportunity as we are^likely ever to have for making a start ,7ith trans-ference of native territories under really good conditions.vfaile
Jhile those ?re ny vierce in general I quite agree with you that, even if transfer is decided on every care must he taken not to -proceed in.a manner so orecrpitate as to alarm the natives.mum
