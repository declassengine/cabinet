Three causes of unrest are, however, increasing in importance every week - housing, profiteering and nationalisation.The Independent Labour Party, believing a new election to be imminent, are working very hard at organisation and. canvassing; they are also concentrating on the forthcoming municipal aleotions.The agitation about the Police Strike seems to be dying down. There are signs of the working classes becoming weary of agitation and strikes.From every part of the United Kingdom the need for instruction in economics is insisted upon.   It seems useless to appeal to the worker for increased production, for he is still possessed by the fallacy that more work per head means more unemployment.    Steps are being taken by unofficial agencies to put sound eoonomic teaching on the film.   There are nearly 4,000 picture houses in the United Kingdom, and the number of persons Visiting them weekly is estimated to be little short of nine millions.    The film is, therefore, likely to reach a far larger publio than can ever be touched by the newspaper or the leaflet.
w ...THE POLIOSThroughout the week the Polioe Union officials harebeen making great efforts to obtain the support of labour,but though oertain sections of organized Labour have been ;lavish with expressions of sympathy and promises of support,it seems unlikely that they will resort to direct aotion.The following organizations have given such promises:-Aberling and Oxford branches of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.Wandsworth Branch of the National Union of General Workers.Workington Trades Council.Cambridge Trades Council.Hendon Trades Council.Birmingham Trades Council.Kingston and District Trades Council.Birmingham Postal Branch of the Postal and Telegraph Clerks. ;    .Keasden Ho. 1 Branch of the National Union of Railwayman.London District Committee of the Society of Amalgamated Toolmakers.Woolwich Labour Party.It is significant that the current issue of &quot;The Worker&quot; suggests that the Police Union officials erred in taking at their face value the many resolutions passed in their favour at Trade Union Conferences.At Liverpool, where the extremists had recommended a three days* strike to enforce recognition of the Police Union, a meeting was held, on August 14th, and the voting was as follows:For a strike............ 105Against ..................   57Abstained...............138Several of the delegates described the meeting as a farceand/
and the latest information is that the strike is postponed, The Dockers^ Union bas definitely refused to participate, a the workers. generally are reported to he tired of striking. The general opinion in Liverpool is that the Government meaa was wise, but there is some sympathy with the dismissed policemen who have seen active service or been in the Foroe for a long period.   WMeanwhile, Police Forces in various parts of the count are resigning from the Union en bloc.   The Isle of Wight County Constabulary, the Stoke-on-Trent Police, and several others have thus withdrawn.   In Leeds and Bradford the Poli are accused of &quot;desertion&quot; by the local Trades Unionists, because they would not join the strike.Meetings of Police strikers were held on the premises discharged soldiers1 organizations at Birmingham on August and at Woolwich on August 17th,   On the latter occasion, ma ex-soldiers expressed sympathy with them.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which has acted throughout as the official organ of the Union, stated on August 14th that discharged policemen at Liverpool and Bootle applied to the Labour Exchange ifor work and were met with a blank refusal.POWER OF THE police in my last report I referred to the waning powers of t Police in dealing with disaffection. There is no doubt tha the sections of the Defence of the Realm Regulations whioh with persons inciting to disaffection are still acting as a deterrent upon the agitators, for at V/olverhampton, where t Is much labour unrest, it is stated that the men are wait! only for the repeal of the Defence of the Realm Act to take drastic action.THE/
UBh)m 3 MTHE HOUSING QUESTION ,There is further evidence this week from practically all districts that the lack of houses is causing great unrest. The Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress has convened;a &quot;Special Congress on Housing&quot;, which will he held at Glasgow on August 23rd.This Congress is the result of a conference held under the auspices of the Scottish labour Housing Association in Glasgow on June 2lst, at v/hich the Parliamentary Committee was urged to take steps to arrange a national strike as a protest against the dilatory handling of the housing problem.The resolution, on which delegates must come instructed to vote, is:&quot;That this Special Congress invites the Trade Unions of Sootland to take a ballot of their,members not later than 30th September, on the question of a stoppage of work, with a view to forcing the Government to deal promptly and effectively with the grave housing problem . in our midst.&quot; . .The basis of representation will be one delegate for every 500 members; Trades Councils may send three delegates.My correspondent reports that the deplorable housing conditions in South Wales are causing much unrest; unfortunately the principal sufferers are ex-Service men, who are anti-revolutionaries.  An acute situation has arisen in Newport, where the Parks Committee has refused to allow the Workers . Housing Committee to hold a demonstration in Shaftesbury Park on August 31st.   The Housing Committee and the local Trades Council have accordingly decided to force an entrance into the Park, and, as feeling is running high, the demonstration may be disorderly.NATIONALIZATION Off THE. COAL MINES ,.The Miners1 Federation will undoubtedly regard the Prime Ministers declaration on the principle of nationalizationas/
as a challenge. (Che official attitude of the federation may he gathered from interTiews with leaders stub as Mr. Hartshj &apos;M.PV; andMr. Hodges. It is not yet possible to Indicate t attitude of the miners as a whole. There are, however, si that their auppor t&apos; of&apos; national i is at i on is4 no t unanimous imous. h South Wales and Lancashire there is a good deal of oppositi ; The majority of the general public appears to be avers from nationalization, and it seems certain that there will be a bitter&apos;controversy about the question.THE CO-OPERATIVE LOCK-OUTThe Co-operative Joint Committee decided on August 16t to dismiss from the service of the movement in the Lancashi Yorkshire and Cheshire areas, as.from August 23rd, all menft of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees. This decision will apply to 30,000 employees and will seriously affect the supplied of thickly populated districts, such as Leeds.&apos;The position 1b curious in that the workers, failing the concessions demanded, tendered their strike notices to take effect on August 23rd, and the dismissals will also become effective on that day.&quot;Lancashire and Yorkshire for! the stronghold of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees, and; it is possible that the course of events may influenoe other co-operative employees.   There is a further complication in regard to those shop&quot; assistants who are not members of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees.THE IflTERNATIOHAL TO3)ES UKIOK CPITOMCEThe International Trades Union Conference was held at Amsterdam from July 28th to&apos; August 2nd.   Finety-one delegate represented 14 countries and 17,740,000 workers.
I(English)* M 5 mThe following were elected as officials of the &quot;Hew&quot;International Trades Union Congress;If) President W.A. Appleton    (Britain)Vioe-President L*H. Jouhaux     (France)&quot;      &quot; Mertene     (Belgium)Secretary *T. (JudegeesVTreasurer ..S. FitflmenIt was decided that the secretariat should he moved from Berlin to Amsterdam. , , ...There was. considerable fi;iction between the various delegates; the Germans particularly formed a constantly complaining minority and were subjected to a severe.attack, regarding Germany^ conduct thi     during the war.   The Swedes, and Austrians supported the Germans. Lr] The Conference decided, after much discussion, that it was inthe interest of the movement to participate in the forthcoming Washington Conference.GrRICULTUBAIi WORKERS   ,.t ;atelThere are no signs that the unrest amongst farm.labourers is subsiding,   ,, , ..... .....It is reported that some 100 men in the Holbeaph area of Lincolnshire have refused to.work with imported Irish agricultural labourers.  According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of 16th August, the men&quot;s main argument is, that if there is a shortage of labour, the Army of Occupation in Ireland should be reduced and the farm workers sent back to their ordinary, employment.About 1000 agricultural workers in the Stoke-on-Trent area are agitating for overtime pay.during the harvest..In the Jteeds distriot ^ is increasing in bitterness.ANNIVERSARY Off PETERLQOThe anniversary of Peterloo was the pooasion for a demonstration of some 5000 people at Manchester on August 16th.   The chiefspeakers/
speakers were Tom Mann, Isaac Brassington, National Unionj Railwayraen, and Ben Turner.  Mann1s speech was merely an exposition of economic fallacies. 1On August ,17th, Philip Snowden and Wallfcead addressed large meeting in the Free Trade Hail, Manchester, also in commemoration of the &quot;Manchester Martyrs&quot;.  During the past week the Labour Press, and more particularly the &quot;Labour Leader *,  have devoted a good deal of space to the anniven and several meetings have been held throughout the country, These call for no special comment and the only enthusiasm displayed emanated from socialist organizations.DEMAND BY TRADE UNION Of FICIAIS FOR HIGHER PAYAn occurrence which is new to the annals of Trade Unio is recorded in the Report of the United Society of Boile and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders for the current month.  Sbi full time officials of the Society address to their fellou members a request for an advance in salary of  1 per week and the consolidation of war bonus as salary, as from .7uty 1st 1919,   They state that this demand is ma&amp;e &quot;owing to ft increased cost of food, wearing apparel and other essentiol of life ..... We are compelled to point out to our members quite frankly that the salaries paid to your Executive Council and Delegates, prior to the war were much too low for the position we hold, with the result that the amount now paid, inolusire of war wages, is not in our judgment &quot;commensurate with the responsibilities of our position or the services rendez*ed.wACTIVITIES OF TOSH AGITATORS&quot; Morgisn Jones, the conscientious objector and agitatori
began work as Welsh Organizing secretary of the Independent ; Labour Party on *August 18th, after his release from prison.W.H. Mainwaring, of Clydach Vale, the Rhondda Valley extremist and the secretary of the Glamorgan Section of the Unofficial Reform Committee, is leaving Mid-Rhondda to take up a position as lecturer at the Central Labour College, London.   His departure from the Rhondda Valley will be a great loss to local extremists, but his Bolshevik propensities will probably do much to influence students at tho college.T.I. Mardy Jones, the South Wales Labour Party organizer, is arranging meetings throughout the coalfields to demand immediate nationalization.ALLEGffJD STORAGE Off ARMS AT GIA SG0\7There have been frequent rumours that arms are being stored in Glasgow by extremists.   I am now informed that certain members of the Clan-na-Gael secreted:arms in the East End and Anderston district.   It is probable that these arms are destined for Ireland.   Investigations are proceeding.THE REELING i&amp;ONOST DISCHARGED SOLDIERSThere have again been fewer adverse reports concerning discharged men.Some of the most active members of the International Union of Ex-Service Men are now frequenting Sinn Fein resorts*in Glasgow. .;u./.:,..\ ,     &apos;The Heath Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers, of which Colonel J..Edward-Vaughan, :J.P., is President, has passed a resolution demanding the resignation from their Executive of all officials who hold extreme views.The Nottingham branch of the National Federation of ; ; - &quot;* Discharged/
M 3 &quot;*Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers held their usual meeting in the Market Place on August 17th.  About 1000 people attended; the tone of this branch, which keeps aloof from all political bodies, continues to be good.My correspondent reports that the speakers at meetings convened by discharged men in the StOke-on-Trent area have a dealt with delayed pensions.(PEE NATIONAL UNION OF ES-SSRVICE meet this society, which has taken over &quot;The Sew World&quot; (formerly the organ of the International Union of Ex-Service Men, published in Glasgow) is extending its activities, and has apparently established close connection with &quot;The Daily Herald.&quot;.&apos;.. -A demonstration was held under the auspices of the Union at Mitcham on August 17th.   Only about 100 people attended and they gradually dwindled to 30.   The chief speakers were , W. Warren, Hon. Secretary of the Merton Branch of the Nation&amp;l Union of Ex-Service Men, and tf, Macullen, member of the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth League.   Both men, who resented the poor attendance, attacked the capitalist system and advocated the socialisation of land on the lines advocated by Mr, Outhwaite.THE RECONSTRUCTION SOCIETYA series of meetings have been held recently in London, Cardiff, Devonport, Birmingham and Coventry by the Reconstruction Society, which is endeavouring to combat revolutionary teaching.The meetings, which have attracted large and appreciate -audiences, have been, on the whole, successful; at Woolwich, , however, the speakers have so far failed to obtain a hearingLABOUR/
(English) &quot; &apos;    &apos;   98x 9 **LABOUR HALL AT TOTTBNBaMVarious labour organizations at Tottenham hare purchased, for  1,600,     Bruce Grove, with the object of centralisation. It is expected that the local branches of the Amalgamated Soolety of Engineers, National Union of Railwaymen and Independent Labour Party will become tenants.WHEER3&apos; COMITTBE AT GREENWICHW,A, Cooper, an extremist who has recently organized a branch of the Communist League at Greenwich, is now engaged on the formation of a Workers1 Committee in the same distriot.A Workers1 Committee has been recently formed in Willesden by W. Taylor.MB, RAMSAY MCDONALDA Frenchman, who recently met Mr. Ramsay Macdonald at Lucerne, reports that Mr. Macdonald intended on his return to England to put the fall of Bela Kun^s Government in Hungary in its true light.   He said that the Communist regime had much to recommend it, and that it had failed, not because of any defect in its theory, but beoause it had no stocks of merchandise and was much handicapped by the blockade.   This is the line taken by extremists in respect of the Soviet Government in Russia, and as regards Hungary it is entirely at variance with the facts, (which will be issued from this Office in a few days in the form of an illustrated pamphlet, with as wide a circulation ao possible).This French correspondent asked Mr. Macdonald whether he would take over some propaganda documents from Hungary. He replied that though he would like to see the documents, he would not undertake to carry them, as he was under strict surveillance: that the English Government was seeking for the flimsiest pretext on which to accuse him, and hewould/
(English),[Be1would, therefore, not carry anything compromising.   He &quot;Experience is my teacher.&quot;MISS SYLVIA, BANKHURSTThis lady has now publicly admitted, in &quot;The Globe&quot; t^J she is a Communist.   Her efforts to hare herself made spool representative of Lenin in this Country have not met with much success.   Her prevarication about the money brought to her from Sweden, her garrulity, and her self-seeking have made the Russian revolutionaries distrust her, and have estranged&apos;the other Bolshevik agents in this Country.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;   ...The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has been making much capital out of the disclosures of the Shop Steward J.T, Murphy, who desert how he was approached and asked to act against prospective strikers in Sheffield.   The facts are that Murphy was approached by a small body of employers and was paid out oi funds provided by these employers.   The object was the verj laudable one of endeavouring to prevent strikes in Munition Works during the war.   It is now reported that Murphy was actually in the pay of Litvinoff!s organization at the tiiflej and that he accepted the employers1 money, with the full knowledge and permission of the revolutionary organization which he belonged, in the hope that he might learn something useful., , IRELAND  .The disturbances in Londonderry, which led to serious collisions with the Police and the troops last week, have 1 , fully reported- in the Press.   They arose out of the usual hostility between the Protestants arid Catholics.The Sinn Fein papers; devote muoh space to de Valere^s American tour,, and enlarge upon the ovation which he reoeiv^in/
lish)in. New York-and-Chicago,   He was certainly received.-by-^inormouev crowds, hut it may be doubted..whether his personality has created muoh impression.   The progress of the Irish Republican loan is scarcely mentioned, and it may, therefore, be assumed that the money is not flowing&apos; in very fast,&quot;New Ireland&quot; is not satisfied with the present position and prospects of Sinn Fein,   It now hopes for a Police Strike, regarding the Force as the &quot;last stronghold of capitalism and imperialism,&quot;Orders were issued on the 7th August to dismantle and seize the printing press of the &quot;Kilkenny People&quot; for open defiance of the censorship,There is reason for believing that the outrages in Clare were organized by Sinn Fein, in order to divert some of the troops and the Police from Tipperary to Clare, and thus give greater freedom to the rebels in Tipperary,In Belfast, OxIea*her and 0,H&amp;3an, released Bolshevist orators and hunger strikers, have been making some rather extreme epeeohes, but they have failed to attract large audiences,   A man named Samuel Herron was sentenced to six months1 imprisonment for a seditious speeoh at Castlewellan.B,H*T.
