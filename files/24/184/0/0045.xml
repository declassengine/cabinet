Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1927secret.Copy No. 3(c.p.. 45 (27).CABINET.PEOPOSALS FOE AN ENABLING BILL . TO DEAL WITH  CHURCHSCHOOLS.ON the 11th November, 1925, the Cabinet authorised me to pursue a certain line of policy in regard to Church Schools (see CP. 440 (25), and Cabinet 52 (25), Conclusion 14). My colleagues may wish to have some account of what has happened since then.I took no immediate action on the Cabinet decision, but several Local Education Authorities took steps to formulate their proposals for local &apos;&quot; concordats.&quot; For the most part these proposals took the form of resolutions passed by the Education Committees after informal and non-committal discussions with representatives of the Anglican and Roman Catholic bodies.These proposals fall into two fairly well-marked categories. Certain Authorities in the South and Midlands, for instance, the West Riding, Shropshire, Wiltshire and Kent, adopted proposals for the transfer of Church Schools to the Local Authority under special arrangements whereby denominational instruction would continue to be given in the transferred schools on certain days in the week. This idea of transfer with special privileges appeared to be acceptable both to a considerable body of Anglican opinion and to Nonconformist opinion, as represented by the Free Church Council. Opinion among the teachers was divided, and the N.U.T., though disliking the idea, did not oppose it officially.Proposals for transfer could not, however, be acceptable to the Roman Catholics, and we were, therefore, confronted by the curious phenomenon that in Lancashire, where religious controversy in the past was particularly acute, several Authorities, including the County Council and Liverpool, put forward proposals of a rather more startling kind. Under these proposals the Local Authority would be empowered to make grants for the repair, and perhaps even the upkeep, of Church Schools in return for some increased measure of control in regard to the management of the schools and the appointment of teachers. So far as I have been able to ascertain, there has been practically no opposition to these proposals from Nonconformist or Protestant opinion in Lancashire, and though the Free Church Council is naturally inclined to regard the idea with suspicion, it seems probable that if arrangements of this kind were confined to existing Church School premises which require renovation if they are to carry on, it would not be a very controversial piece of legislation.These local negotiations were discussed by the Associations of Local Authorities, and the Association of Education Committees passed a resolution on the subject in 1926 (see Appendix (i) ). A deputation from these Associations came to see me on the 24th June, and on the basis of the Cabinet&apos;s decision I made a statement to them, which was published at the time (see Appendix (ii) ).The events of the next few months seemed to show that little progress was likely to be made by the procedure of purely local negotiations. The proposals for xhe transfer of Church Schools were rejected by the Anglican Diocesan Bodies in Yorkshire and Wiltshire and at Lancaster, the negotiations in Kent dragged on in a rather half-hearted way, and, in fact, Shropshire appeared to be the only County wdiere substantial agreement had been reached on the Authority&apos;s proposals. These discouraging results may have been partly due to the fact that authorities memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.[15760]b
had exercised considerable ingenuity in casting their &quot; transfer &quot; proposals in such a form as not to require new legislation. To avoid legislation on such a subject is, of course, tempting; but Church people naturally wished that what is really a substantial change of system should be introduced by legislation rather than slipped informally through the loopholes of the existing law. In view of the unsatisfactory course of local negotiations, those members of Local Authorities who were anxious to bring matters to a head felt that it had become necessary to lay down more clearly, for general guidance, the lines of an Enabling Bill which they would be prepared to accept. Their idea was to lay more or less definite proposals as to future legislation before the Association of Education Committees, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, before the Commission on Religious Teaching recently appointed by the Archbishops under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Hadow. For this purpose they asked me to assist them in drawing up a memorandum of proposals, on the understanding that any such memorandum would be put forward solely on their own responsibility. The memorandum in Appendix (iii) was accordingly drafted in my Department, but no use has been made of it, because at this point a new element was introduced into the situation.On the 19th November, 1926, the Church Assembly adopted the report of a Committee laying down &quot; emphatically &quot; that no Enabling Bill would be accepted as satisfactory which did not contain a number of provisions far in advance of \ anything which the Local Authorities were prepared to contemplate. Unfortunately the Archbishop of Canterbury was absent from these meetings through illness and the Assembly, being left without any proper guidance, acted as all popular assemblies are apt to do, without in the least realising the nature or the effect of their decision. I have been since assured by various representatives of the Church that - the Report did not really represent Anglican opinion. This may be true, but the effect of the Assembly &apos;s decision on the Local Authorities was naturally disastrous. That effect may be seen from the report of the proceedings of the Association of Education Committees on the 22nd December contained in Appendix (iv).The position now is almost exactly what it was a year ago. The Government have expressed their general willingness to consider proposals for an Enabling Bill put forward by Local Authorities, provided that such proposals are substantially agreed by all sections of local opinion. Local Authorities have hitherto been unable to put forward such proposals, and so long as this is the case, the Government can take no further action. I understand, however, that Sir Henry Hadow, as Chairman of the Archbishop&apos;s Commission, intends to try to work out during the coming year proposals which would be acceptable both to the Local Authorities and to the Church of England. The Commission has already taken evidence informally from the Chairman of the West Riding Education Committee and the Secretary of the Association of Education Committees. If the Church Assembly does not commit another faux pas in the interval, it is possible that the Commission may succeed in putting . forward proposals which would meet with general goodwill, but, in the meantime, we should certainly let the whole matter rest where it is. So far as I can judge, the Memorandum in Appendix (iii) may be taken as representing proposals on which a substantial measure of general agreement might be hoped for, but I doubt very much whether it would ever be safe to go much beyond these limits.It may be well to add a note on a point of phraseology which has assumed more importance than it deserves. It is generally agreed that a Local Authority should have power to bind itself to give Christian teaching in all its schools on an agreed syllabus within the limits of the Cowper-Temple Clause. Local Authorities, however, object, for various reasons, to giving &quot; statutory &quot; force, irrevocable except by Act of Parliament, to a local guarantee of this kind. They prefer that such a guarantee should be a term of the contract for the transfer of schools and this is the proposal contained in the Memorandum in Appendix (iii).E. P.Board of Education., February 9, 1927.
APPENDIX.(i-)Resolution passed by the Association of Education Committees in Conference atHarrogate on June 10, 1926.&quot; That the difficulties arising in many areas from the present administrative relations of Provided and Non-Provided schools should be alleviated by an Enabling Act empowering local arrangements of varying character to be made to suit local conditions.&quot;To this was added, as a conditioning clause, the following rider : &quot; The foregoing declaration is conditional upon all expenditure involved in carrying into effect approved schemes under such an Enabling Act being recognised as expenditure in respect of which Parliamentary Grant shall be made.&quot;(ii.)Statement made by the President of the Board, of Education to the Deputation from, the Association of Education Committees, the County Councils Association and the Association of Municipal Corporations, on June 24, 1926.&quot; In April last year the County Councils Association represented to me the desirability of reaching an agreed solution of certain administrative problems arising out of the dual system in elementary education. I answered that I could not express any opinion until I knew more exactly the lines upon which local authorities would suggest that such a solution should proceed, but that, if Local Education Authorities would submit proposals to me, after conference with all the parties interested in their respective areas, I would consider wdiether effect could be given to them by an Enabling Bill.Since that time the matter has been considered by a number of Authorities and you have now come to me to report progress and to enquire my views. I understand that certain schemes have been tentatively sketched out by various Authorities. Generally speaking, these schemes resemble each other pretty closely, and appear, broadly speaking, to amount to this : that Authorities should be empowered to accept the transfer of voluntary schools to them upon conditions which would allow denominational instruction to be given in them on certain days in the week. In all other respects the transferred schools are to be conducted in school hours as Council Schools, but religious instruction within the terms of Section 28 of the Act of 1921 is to be provided in all Council Schools, and during the hours set apart for such instruction facilities are to be afforded, where desired, for the withdrawal of children for denominational teaching outside the school premises. Alternative schemes have been proposed under which the Local Authority is to have the power to assist voluntary schools without requiring their transfer, but upon conditions which will give the Authority more control than at present over the management, organisation and grouping of schools.I do not think that it would be desirable for me to comment upon these particular proposals, since the schemes in question have not yet, for the most part, been communicated to me in any definite form, and it is not yet apparent how far they coimrrand general assent. But their character is clear. They do not seek to lay down new principles, but aim at removing certain administrative difficulties by local agreement. They provide means whereby voluntary bodies may make mutually advantageous arrangements with the Local Authority for the future management of particular schools or groups of schools, but they do not contemplate any general change in the relationships and functions of the State and voluntary bodies or in the position and duties of teachers. In the event of a considerable number of Local Authorities submitting agreed schemes of this character, I can say now that the Government would be prepared in principle to introduce enabling legislation of a permissive character to facilitate the adoption of such schemes, provided that they are satisfied that such legislation is generally acceptable.[15760] &quot; b 2
There is one feature common to all the schemes which have come to my knowledge, on which I may perhaps say one additional word. Instruction in the Christian faith, within the terms of Section 28 of the Act, is, in fact, being provided in all areas to-day in the Council Schools, often in accordance with an agreed syllabus, and I have been greatly impressed during the past 1.8 months by the serious spirit in which the teaching profession as a whole accept and desire to carry out this responsibility; but there is at present no means by which a Local Authority can enter into a statutory undertaking to provide such instruction. It is proposed, as I understand it, that, as part of the arrangements contemplated in these schemes, the Local Authority should be empowered to give such an undertaking in respect of all Council Schools as well as of all transferred Schools. I hope that we may regard this proposal as, in a special degree, beyond the reach of objection or controversy.&quot;(iii.)Memorandum on Enabling Legislation.1. The proposals here explained deal with the problem of meeting the cost of necessary improvements in the buildings and premises of public elementary schools in cases where the existing law throws the burden on managers who cannot draw upon public funds for the purpose.2. The present proposals presume the readiness of the Church of England on the one hand, and the local education authorities on the other, to come to an understanding with regard to religious instruction, and also, subject to satisfactory arrangements under that head, with regard to improvements in the general organisa-tion and co-ordination of public elementary schools under the supervision of the local education authorities, and under such conditions as will give them increased powers of general control. It is proposed in the first place to give greater latitude to local education authorities and school managers in coming to agreements with regard to the transfer of voluntary schools to the authorities and with regard to the conduct of such schools when so transferred. As an alternative, where school managers see their way to carrying on their school as a voluntary school for a further term of years on condition of receiving substantial initial assistance towards the cost of necessary improvements to the premises, it is proposed to confer on local education authorities the power of contributing to that cost without taking a transfer, but under agreements giving them fuller powers of control and securing- that in any case the school in question shall continue to be available as part of the public s^rstem for a specified term of years. The agreements under both heads must be subject to the approval of the Board of Education after consideration of any objections that are raised upon publication of the proposal in the district concerned. It is also suggested that in all public elementary schools greater latitude should be allowed than at present with regard to the times at which religious instruction may be given. The proposals relate only to existing voluntary schools, that is to say, public elementary schools at present carried on as schools not provided by the local education authority, and they will take the form of an amendment of the Education Act, 1921, by which previous educational legislation was consolidated. It should be understood that a &quot; transfer &quot; is always a transaction under which the school will be conducted as a council or provided school, or a renewal or extension of such a transaction.3.   The following is an outline of the proposals in greater detail : -(A.) Transfers to Local Education Authority.An agreement for the transfer of an existing voluntary school to the local education authority may include provisions to the following effect, or any of them :  (a.) A provision for the appointment of one or more persons to represent the interests of the transferors or other specified persons on the body of managers of the transferred school or of the group of schools in which it - is  included.    The  special managers thus  appointed  may either  be additional to the other managers or they may be substituted for one or more of the managers, who would otherwise have been appointed by the local education authority.
(b.) A provision for the giving in the transferred school, otherwise than at the cost of the authority, of special religious instruction for children whose parents desire it. This instruction would be of such a character as the transferors desire, not being inconsistent with the provisions, if any, of the Trust Deed of the school, and will not be subject to the restrictions of Section 28 (2) of the Act of 1921 (the Cowper-Temple Clause).(c.) An undertaking by the authority that, subject to Section 28 (2) of the Act of 1921, Christian religious instruction in accordance with a syllabus to be locally agreed upon shall be given in the public elementary schools provided by the authority, or in any such schools to which the undertaking extends.(B.) Alternative Power of Contribution to Cost of Improvements.(1.) The local education authority and the managers of an existing voluntary school and any other necessary parties may enter into an agreement under which the whole or part of the cost of necessary alterations or improvements in the school premises shall be paid by the authority, in consideration of the observance of certain conditions, for a term of years to be specified in the agreement. These conditions shall include : (a.) A condition that the managers shall continue, for the specified term, to carry on the school and to keep the premises in repair and observe the other conditions of recognition of the school as a non-provided public elementary school.(&amp;.) Such other conditions with respect to the conduct of the school as are necessary to the better organisation and administration of secular instruction in the district, including, if it is though fit, conditions as to the appointment of managers by the authority in place of all or any of the foundation managers.(c.) A condition that, if in the course of the specified term of years the managers find themselves unable or unwilling to carry on the school as a public elementary school in accordance with the conditions of the agreement up to the end of the period, the school is to be transferred to the authority on conditions such as are described under head (A.) above.(2.) Subject to the approval or directions of the Ministry of Health, the authority may borrow money for the purpose of contributions under sub-head (1) above, but the currency of the loan must not exceed the period fixed by the agreement for the observance of its conditions.(C.) Supplemental Provisions.(1.) Before making an agreement with regard to transfer under head (A.) or contribution under head (B.), the local education authority must give public notice in such form as the Board may require, and an appeal against the proposal may be made in accordance with section 18 (1) of the Act of 1921 on the ground that any of the proposed provisions are not suited to meet the wants of the district.(2.) Any such agreement shall be subject to the approval of the Board, who shall have regard to the interest of secular instruction, to the wishes of the parents as to the education of their children, and to the economy of the rates, and the agreement as settled and approved after the expiration of the period of publication shall have effect notwithstanding anything in the Act of 1921.(3.) The provision in section 27 (1) (6) of the Act of 1921 restricting the times for religious observance or instruction to the beginning and end of a meeting of a public elementary school shall cease to apply to provided schools and shall also be dispensed with in the case of any non-provided school if the managers desire, with the approval of the local education authority, to make some other arrangement. But in every case the times must be conveniently arranged for the purpose of allowing the withdrawal of any scholar under the Conscience Clause.
Enabling Bill :  Report of Special Sub-Committee.The Special Sub-Committee appointed for the purpose has held consultations on two occasions with representatives of the National Union of Teachers on the question of an Enabling Act designed to embody the principles of the resolution passed by the annual meeting of the Association in conference at Harrogate in June 1926;These consultations have been brought to an end partly because the Executive Committee of the National Union of Teachers gave instructions to their representa-tives that they could not agree to a policy involving a variety of local agreements not yet determined and anticipating unknown legislative powers.The general principle of the National Union of Teachers appears to be that any school transferred to a Local Education Authority must be regarded in all respects as being a Council school, and therefore there can be nothing, either direct or indirect, in the nature of religious tests to be applied in connection with the appointment of teachers to such schools.On the question of the proposal to aid in the maintenance and improvement of non-provided schools without involving their transfer to the Local Authority, the policy of the Union seems to be less definite and determined.In this particular connection the real issue appeared to be whether the National Union of Teachers would be consenting parties to a policy which empowered the Local Authority to improve the conditions of non-provided schools without requiring their transfer to the Authority.It was on this issue that the first joint meeting adjourned until the teachers&apos; representatives should have had time to consider further their decision in this matter. Consultation on this question was resumed at a later date, but it happened that this second consultation took place immediately after the Church Assembly had approved the principles of the report of their Education Commission, from which the following is an extract: &quot; The Commission desire to lay it down most emphatically that no Enabling Bill will be satisfactory which does not make statutory provision &quot; 1. For adequate religious instruction, subject to a conscience clause, as an integral part of the curriculum in all schools, training colleges and training-departments receiving rate or State aid ; and&quot;2. For the supervision of such instruction in all training colleges and departments other than denominational training colleges, by the establishment of Religious Education (Advisory) Committees, both local and central. These Committees should be representative of the Local Authorities, of religious bodies, and of the teachers, and should exercise such powers and functions as may be entrusted to them by the.Education Authorities.&quot; Further, inasmuch as the Commission hold that denominational schools should be treated as an essential part of the national system of education, the Bill should be so drafted as to give power to any Local Education Authority, which thinks fit to do so, to build or to contribute to the building of denomination-tional schools, and to provide for the continuity of their religious character somewhat on the lines of the Scottish Act.&quot; Subject to these conditions, the Commission are prepared to welcome an Enabling Bill as providing a hopeful prospect of co-operation between Church and State in the work of national education on religious lines.&quot;It was felt that the decision of the Church Assembly to give its endorsement to these principles and conditions had so altered the position that no useful purpose would be served by continuing in consultation at the present time.The Executive Committee is asked to have in mind that these consultations were held as a preliminary to the Executive Committee arriving at a decision as to the stepsAssociation of Education Committees.Extract from Minutes of the Meeting of the Executive Committee held at the, College of Preceptors, Bloomsbury Square, London, W.C., on Wednesday, the 22nd day of December, 1926.
to be taken to carry into effect, as far as possible, the policy laid down by the Associa-tion in conference in June last.It will now be necessary that the Executive Committee should consider what action, if any, is to be taken, and what statement, if any, is to be issued in the light of the present position.It is therefore suggested to the Executive Committee that the report of the Education Commission of the Church Assembly is an attempt to convert what the Association of Education Committees desired and intended to be a measure of local option into something entirely different, partaking of the nature of a national settlement.It is to be remembered, however, that ever since the idea of the Enabling Bill was first mooted it has been recognised that, if a renewal of old controversies is to be avoided, the discussion and negotiation of arrangements affecting non-provided schools must be conducted by each Local Authority on the basis of the concrete needs of its own area, and that anything in the nature of national negotiations should be avoided until at any rate a substantial measure of agreement has been reached, between the various parties in local administrative areas, including, it is hoped, some of the largest areas.When the question came officially before the Association of Education Com-mittees, those who raised it did so in the belief that satisfactory progress had already been made in certain areas and in the belief that a provision which would allow of wide variety in the type of local agreements would result in a still greater measure of progress in local discussion and negotiation.It may very properly be argued that the recent debate and resolution of the Church Assembly emphasises the danger of any premature move in the direction of national negotiations. It is obvious that the Executive Committee cannot recommend the Association to adopt the report of the Bishop of Wakefield&apos;s Committee, which has been adopted by the Assembly.And it may well be that any attempt on the part of the Executive Committee to comment upon it in detail, to particularise our objections to it, and to explain in contrast to it, the limits within which, in our opinion, any Enabling Bill must be confined, would tend to promote further controversy and to prejudice the real spirit of practical co-operation which at present characterises the relations between Local Authorities and the Managers of non-provided schools in nearly all the education areas in the country.Resolved by the Executive Committee : That the Executive Committee take no further action in this matter beyond circulating the general statement set out above, and that it be left to the individual Authorities to carry on such discussions with the Managers of non-provided schools in their areas as may be required to meet their particular problems.
