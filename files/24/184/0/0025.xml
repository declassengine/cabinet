[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ] Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1927.SECRET. Copy No.      i QC.P. 25 (27).DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.BEFORE the Cabinet separated for the Christmas holidays, it was agreed that we should take into renewed consideration our relations with Russia as soon as convenient after the recess. But before Parliament adjourned, the Prime Minister received privately representatives of that section of our Party in the House of Commons which has been most forward in pressing for the breaking off of diplomatic relations, and at Mr. Locker-LampsoAs suggestion a memorandum was prepared by Mr. Gregory of the Foreign Office on the diplomatic and international consequences of such a breach, and submitted for the Prime Minister&apos;s information.I now circulate this Memorandum (N 5670/367/38) to the Cabinet.The proposal to break off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government raises issues of equal importance in the two spheres of foreign and domestic policy. I recognise that it cannot be treated as purely a question of foreign policy, but before dealing with its domestic aspect, I should like to supplement Mr. Gregory&apos;s Memorandum by one or two observations of my own on that side of the question.Part I. Effect on Foreign Relations.There are certain considerations to which I desire to draw the special attention of my colleagues : 1. The mere breaking off of diplomatic relations would mark our displeasure and indignation at the unfriendly action of the Soviet Government in a striking and even sensational way, but it would not be a fatal or, in my opinion, even a serious blow to them, and what effect it had in this respect would rapidly wear off. It might possibly be followed by similar action by Italy, though not if their breach with us led the Soviet Government again to place trade orders with Italian firms. It would not, I think, alter the policy of the United States of America, which have not recognised the Soviet Government, nor that of France, which has recognised and is again trying to negotiate a commercial treaty. It might lead the Soviet Govern-ment to show itself more yielding in these negotiations.2. It would, as Mr. Gregory says, have a very disturbing effect on Germany and throughout Eastern Europe. Poland, under Marshal Pilsudski, is showing great restlessness; his policy is uncertain, the language which he has held to the French Ambassador is disquieting. M. Zaleski, the Polish Foreign Minister, has, I believe, no desire for adventure. I canot say the same of the Marshal, and I cannot forecast the effect on him of such action on our part. Any disturbance in those parts must gravely affect the Baltic States. Lithuania would probably be thrown completely into the hands of the Soviet Government.3. The effect in Germany might be formidable. The Nationalists of Germany have throughout based their opposition to the Locarno policy on the thesis that good relations with Russia are, as Bismarck held, of vital consequence to Germany, and that Locarno was a British trap to involve Germany in BritaiAs quarrel with the Soviet. I cannot doubt that an open breach between Russia and ourselves would gravely embarrass Dr. Stresemann in the pursuit of his policy of reconciliation with the West. It would certainly encourage the Nationalists in their hope that presently with the aid of Russia they will be able to challenge the settlement of the eastern frontiers. The consequences might be particularly serious if, as at this moment seems probable, the Nationalists join the Government.4. Turkish policy is undecided. Turkey is at this moment hesitating between reliance on Russia and reliance on the League of Nations.   She fears Italy.  Without3795   [15686]
the special guarantee of a great Power, she is afraid that the League might prove an insufficient protection and that reluctance to offend Italy might bias the Council&apos;s judgment in a dispute. She therefore hesitates to abandon the support of Russia, whose goodwill she would forfeit by giving a western orientation to her policy and by joining the League. I think that our action would alarm her and thrust her back on Russia.5. For similar, though not quite the same, reasons, the effect on British influence and interests in Persia might be bad. The breach would stimulate the. anti-British activities of the Soviet Government in Persia. Persia fears Russia more than us, and this fear is the source of much of our difficulty in Persia, for it prevents Persia from giving us satisfaction lest by so doing she incur the active hostility of the Soviet. The greater the tension between Russia and Britain, the more acute will this fear be.6. Since the breach of diplomatic relations will not seriously weaken the position of the Soviet Government, it cannot be expected that it will lead to a change of policy on their part. It will merely cause them to intensify all the acts of which we complain. What, then, is to be the end? We have shot our bolt. Short of declaring war, there is nothing more which we can do. The situation will continue indefinitely. I can see no prospect of its leading to conditions in which we could&apos;resume relations, or even renew negotiations, with any prospect of success.Part II. Effect on the Internal Situation.I turn now to consider the effect of a breach on conditions in this country. That section of opinion which calls for the expulsion of the agents of the Soviet Govern-ment appears to think that the expulsion would put a stop to Bolshevik propaganda here.   In this they are clearly wrong.It would not prevent propaganda in this country nor stop the transfer of money^ to this country for use in Communist agitation. Neither would it prevent communication between the two countries or the visit to Soviet Russia of deputations of British nationals or even of school children intended to be indoctrinated with Bolshevist ideas. The Home Office holds that it is not expedient or possible to refuse passports in such cases, and it would be in accordance with recent practice where there has been a breach of relations (without war) in recent years, e.g.,Mexico, not to interfere with the issue.It is difficult, therefore, to see what protection it would afford us which we do not already possess.2. Trade interests (including banking), as far as they were affected, would be critical. They have done some business; if political conditions were not so uncertain, they believe that they could do more. From my experience in the Mexican case 1 should anticipate that there would soon be considerable pressure from this source for the resumption of diplomatic relations on trade grounds. This view would also be strongly pressed by the Labour party. Exaggerated estimates of the possibilities of Russian trade would again become current, and would be sedulously fostered-from the Bolshevik side. It would be represented that we were aggravating uneniploy-ment and driving trade away.3. The events of last year the General Strike and. the Coal Strike have left the Labour Party profoundly divided. The Moderates of Labour have become aware of the chasm opening at their feet. They know that they must either beat the extremists now or that they themselves are beaten and the control of the party passes into Red hands. This seems to me to be the biggest issue in domestic politics at the present time. The immediate effect of a Red victory would no doubt be to alarm the country and to strengthen our own Party position, but its ultimate consequences might be disastrous in their effect on the industrial position and life of the nation. We have, in any case, to deal with some very delicate questions in regard to trade disputes and the position of trades unions. Lconceive that it would be in the highest degree inexpedient to complicate these issues and to render their settlement more difficult by introducing a distinct political issue drawn from the field of foreign policy and likely to reunite in opposition to us the parties who are now so sharply divided among&quot; themselves.Can it be doubted that this would be the result? There has been no real opposition to our Russian policy so far. The MacDonalds and Thomases, the Snowdens and Clynes of the Labour Party know that the Soviet is as much their enemy as ours; that, indeed, they are the first objects of its animosity. But on this new issue they would be forced to combine with those in their own ranks whom they
ought to be fighting. They would be swept off their feet even if they wished to support us, but all their past utterances go to show that on this point they would be in agreement with the extremists within their own party and would be forced to unite with the avowed Communists outside it.Mr. Lloyd George is a somewhat erratic politician, but on this matter he has always held the same view, contending that the only way to break down Bolshevism and to destroy or modify the Soviet system is not by ostracising Russia but by cultivating relations between Russia and the outside world. He would have liked to go much further at Genoa than the then Cabinet would sanction. It would certainly be consistent with all his past utterances and with what little I know of his present views to denounce our action as impolitic. I regard it as certain that he would do so, and I do not think that we could count on any support from the Grey Liberals. We should thus present both Oppositions with a cry on which they could all unite, and the extremists would suddenly find that they had been presented with a victory at a moment when it is to be devoutly hoped that they are going to be thoroughly crushed.A. C.January 24. 1927.
Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.CONFIDENTIAL.[N 5670/387/38]RUSSIA :  MEMORANDUM BY Mr. GREGORY.Mr. LOCKER-LAMPSON tells me that the agitation for the expulsion of the Bolshevik Mission (or missions) from this country is becoming well-nigh irresistible.It seems therefore requisite that I should once more review, in the strictly diplomatic field, the arguments for and against a breach of relations with Soviet Russia. At the same time, I would add various considerations on the method by which the breach should be effected, if it is decided on.(A.)Arguments for and against a Breach.The most potent argument in favour of a breach of relations with Russia is obviously the indisputable fact that the Soviet is to all intents and purposes short of direct armed conflict at war with the British Empire. Whether by interference in the strikes at home or by fomenting the anti-British forces in China, in fact, by her action all the world over, from Riga to Java, the Soviet Power has as its main objective the destruction of the British Power. To that all its other activities are subordinated. This is, indeed, a commonplace. The questions therefore arise : (a) Is it, in the circumstances, consistent with the maintenance of British dignity to affect to ignore the real truth and allow relations to continue notwithstanding; and (b) would this country, by openly proclaiming the truth and breaking off relations, deal a blow at Russia which is likely to be effective ?The answer to the first question is presumably in the negative. We have, however, tried to get out of that difficulty by letting the world understand that it is by our goodwill alone and for our interests alone that we condescend not to sever relations, an Olympian attitude which can be maintained only up to a point, which is liable to be misinterpreted and which is viewed with scepticism, not only in Russia, but largely throughout the East. A peculiarly outrageous act of the Soviets would force us to abandon it, and let the consequences look after themselves.But, leaving aside the possibility of an intolerable provocation which may force our hand, if we should now decide on domestic grounds that the time for a rupture has come, we are still faced with the difficulty of satisfying ourselves that it is going to lead us anywhere in particular. If we could follow up a rupture by dealing the Russians a damaging blow, it would undoubtedly be worth while.The prevailing attitude of the Soviet Government in regard to ourselves appears to be this. It is to some extent paradoxical. While, on the one hand, desiring and endeavouring to encompass our destruction, on the other, it is ardently anxious to come to a full-dress agreement with us: not merely for the purpose of obtaining a loan, but politically, because the belief is apparently prevalent in Russia that until the Soviet has obtained the whole-hearted recognition of the greatest Power, it cannot properly demonstrate its own stability to the world. Recognition by us would be a, stepping-stone to greater things, though the greater things might easily be and no doubt would be of a destructive order.If this diagnosis is correct, it does undoubtedly afford us some encouragement that by a rupture we might set the Russian clock back. The Russians are Orientals, and it is among Orientals that their propaganda is most successful. The success that they are having is largely due to the propagated conviction that Great Britain is too weak to take any action against them, and has no alternative but to sit down impotently under their provocation.   A sudden reversal of our attitude, if property3743   [15573]   [15686a]
stage managed, might act as a bombshell throughout China, Persia, Afghanistan and along the Indian border: the Oriental being traditionally reported to understand only a display of strength.The circumstances and results of our policy in May 1923 should here be recalled as relevant to the issue. At that time we had been both insulted and outraged  insulted over our mild and restrained plea for the humane treatment of certain religious men under sentence of death, and outraged by the continued seizure of our trawlers in the White Sea. We demanded satisfaction on a number of points, including the inevitable propaganda, in a strongly-worded ultimatum, failing compliance with which the Trade Agreement was to be terminated. The effect of this sudden and unexpected violence by us was instantaneous, and caused a panic in the Bolshevik camp. Within a month or so the whole of our demands (with two not essential exceptions) were conceded. Yet, at that time, both Lenin and Djerdjinsky, the props of the system, were alive.Consequently, some advantageous result of a rrvpture might reasonably be anticipated in the nature of a marked depreciation of Bolshevik stock, both at home and abroad, and might, indeed, be much greater that we are able to foresee. Russia, belittled and boycotted by us once more, and at a moment when her economic and financial position is none too good and many of her leaders have disappeared, might weaken considerably under the blow, domestically and externally. She would, of course, intensify her propaganda, but the ground on which it was sown would be less fertile. Yet this is necessarily in the nature of speculation, and once more all that can be said is that, should a rupture be decided on, the possibility of considerable advantage to us is not to be excluded. It must, however, be insisted that such action would be in the nature of a gamble.There is, nevertheless, another possible result to be borne in mind, predicted by certain observers, which might prove wholly embarrassing to us. The Soviet Government might, under the stress of strong action from here, come to heel over the controversial issues and propose to us an agreement in terms which would have all the appearance of being acceptable. We might, therefore, within a few weeks find ourselves in the possession of a boomerang of which we should not know exactly how to get rid. As it is, in other words, quite certain that any concessions would be entirely illusory, it would be far better not to court a situation in which they are offered.   This is, of course, an argument against a rupture.The position must now be examined from the highly-important angle of its effect on the continent. There is no doubt that it would cause a diplomatic uneasiness among the greater States of Europe and dismay among the lesser, particularly those in the East.The present regime in France would, it may be assumed, welcome for domestic reasons an Anglo-Russian rupture, and would be unlikely, and probably unable, to reap any benefits therefrom. Germany, on the other hand, would deplore a development which would render her already embarrassed position midway between Russia and Locarno even more troublesome. Italy whose intentions, however, it is a mental presumption to endeavour to fathom might conceivably be disconcerted, despite Signor Mussolini&apos;s Leghorn statement, at the prospect of the resultant rapprochement between Russia and Turkey.Poland, deprived of a certain security engendered by a correct relationship between Great Britain and Russia, might conceive it necessary, especially now, under the anti-Russian Pilsudski, to create fresh, and possibly dangerous, guarantees for her own safety. Finland and the Baltic States would professedly be alarmed by the quarrel.But, it may be argued that the sum of these possible contingencies does not necessarily create an international situation that is directly against our interests. Possibly; but it would almost certainly create an atmosphere of unrest, and therefore a step backwards. It would obviously be folly to impair the results of Locarno and give opportunities for sabotage, if not worse, in one direction or another. Peace is the paramount international need, and a definitely outlawed Russia would be bound to seek increased means of disturbing it. It seems a pity to run a risk after the good work done this yea,r.Finally, it is necessary to repeat a consideration that has been brought forward on the various occasions on which this question has been discussed. If relations are severed, under what circumstances can they be resumed ? When the Soviet Govern-ment of Russia has ceased to be Bolshevik ? Then we shall have to wait, according to the predictions, to the Greek calends.   The new generation which is growing up
in Russia is reported to be more actively Bolshevik even than the old. When the Soviet Government has finally dissociated itself from the Third International? Then it will have ceased to be the Soviet Government. When it has given guarantees for good behaviour ? But its guarantees have been tested over and over again and found worthless. Thus relations could only be renewed under the same conditions as they exist to-day, and it would be exceedingly difficult to find a pretext for resumption. Yet we can hardly contemplate a period of years during which we were not in relations.The trade position has also to be considered, and this ought to be left to the judgment of the Board of Trade. But they should bear in mind that the gain to our trade in Europe by such relations as we have with Russia under existing conditions is probably counter-balanced by the loss we suffer through Bolshevik action in China.Nor does there appear to be the slightest improvement in the prospect of an economic settlement. Only yesterday, Mr. Leslie Urquhart, addressing the shareholders of the Russo-Asiatic Company, read a statement which he had received in writing the day before from the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires. The latter was able, he said, &quot;to inform me that the Soviet Government does not intend to give concessions over those properties which are being exploited by the Government itself and for which the Government has sufficient capital for exploitation .... where these conditions are absent, the Soviet Government is interested in giving such properties under concession.&quot;The Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires has this very day informed me, a propos of a reply to a Parliamentary question on the 8th instant, that the recognition of debts is absolutely out of the question.If, therefore, the property holders are to receive no satisfaction whatever  which is what this amounts to and there is still no chance of a recognition of debts, then it may be confidently asserted that an economic settlement with Russia is not even within sight, and that the chances of improved trade conditions which are dependent on the restoration of confidence in the City can be disregarded.The United States might, of course, step in unexpectedly where we have failed to tread. The Soviet is making American recognition its second objective, and M. Rakovski is clamouring to go to America to attempt it. But there are no important signs that the United States are anxious to meet these approaches, nor is there any political or economic reason why they should.This, then, concludes the discussion. The arguments pro and con are to some extent evenly balanced, and, though a negative policy suggests a certain paralysis, a positive policy in this case is unlikely to make things, taken as a whole, any better than they are at present. Being a leap in the dark, it might easily make things worse. The ejection of the Bolsheviks from this country would be a thoroughly pleasurable proceeding, but it would be rather the satisfaction of an emotion than an act of useful diplomacy. We should, moreover, cut off the sources of information in Moscow,, and have to carry on ordinary routine business through roundabout channels. Above all, we should forfeit any personal influence we may possess for restraining the Bolsheviks from greater enormities than they commit already. And finally, the important argument about ultimate resumption of relations after a break is difficult to meet. There are the considerations of diplomatic expediency that have to be weighed against those moral and domestic considerations which are outside the scope of this discussion.(B.)In the event of a decision to sever relations with the Soviet Government, procedure will have to be carefully considered.In the first instance, a breach should involve the withdrawal of our mission from Moscow and its representatives from Petrograd and Vladivostok; and the ejection from this country of the Soviet Mission at Chesham House, and the whole Russian staff of both Arcos and Centrosoyus. Any half-measure, such as the ejection of Arcos alone, would have no sense.This wholesale departure on both sides would not necessarily result from a denunciation of the Trade Agreement: at least, this is debatable. The diplomatic relations established in 1924 to some extent absorbed those established under the Trade Agreement and added more. The ultimate settlement Avas to have swallowed the Trade Agreement so completely that provision was made for its disappearance. The position is therefore illogical; but it is clear that, if a general clearance of
Bolsheviks from this country is desired, it will not be sufficient merely to denounce the Trade Agreement. The notification of ejection must be given in more general terms.The next point is that, if it is to be a successful coup, the Bolsheviks must not be allowed to argue about it. If we begin by sending them a note, in which we enumerate their iniquities and which has the character of an ultimatum, we shall find ourselves landed in a controversy that will never come to an end. At all events, long before it is half-way through, the pitch will have been so successfully queered that our original intention will have become quite incapable of execution. Nor is it of the slightest use to found our charge on documents the authenticity of which, as we know, can be disputed till doomsday though their ex post facto production may serve a subsidiary purpose. A note stating that it is common knowledge that the Soviet Government is subverting British interests from one end of the world to the other, and that therefore relations are no longer possible, would be unanswerable. Finally, it must never be forgotten that Sir R. Hodgson must be given timely warning of any impending action of this kind. The Bolsheviks do not appear to be quite as truculent as they were; but it would not do to take any risks, even now.J. D. GREGORY.Foreign Office, December 10, 1926.o
