CABINET.PROPOSALS IN LOCAL BILLS FOR MUNICIPAL TRADINGMEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP HEALTH.1.     Two Local Bills for next Session contain proposals to enable the Local Authorities to undertake the sale of coal.The West Bromwich Corporation apply for a general power, without qualifications.    If it were granted, they could sell coal either retail or wholesale.The^Iiverpool Corporation apply for power to sell coal &quot;during any coal strike or lock-out or at other times when the supply of coal within the City is or is likely to become Inadequate or when retailed to the public at unjustifiably high prices&quot;.If the powers are granted in these two cases, there is no doubt that other local Authorities will later follow with similar applications.This is apparently the first time that a Local Authority in England and Wales has asked for these powers. In 1923, the Belfast Corporation applied to the Northern Ireland Parliament for such powers, but the proposal was rejected.2.     It will be remembered that the Cabinet ultimately decided not to promote any legislation to carry out the recommendation of the Samuel Commission to empower Local Authorities to engage in the sale of coal.During an emergency, the Government can, if they think fit, authorise Local Authorities to sell coal.
35. At first sight it would appear reasonable that the various parts of the county should receive Government assistance in respect of elementary education mainly through the reduction of the general county rate, which runs uniformly over all&apos; districts, i.e., by allocating to the general county fund the bulk of the general grant, only a minor part being reserved for purposes of control for special allocation to elementary education funds. Were the Part III areas not materially different from each other and the county in their elementary education requirements and in their ability to meet them, such a course would present obvious advantages. Unfortunately, however, these authorities present very wide divergencies in both respects. For example, in the county of Lancashire, the urban district of Hindley has 50 per cent, more children inits elementary schools in proportion to its popula-tion than the urban district of Stretford; on the other hand the assessable value Hindley per head of population is less than one half that of Stretford. In so far therefore as the general grant to Lancashire were allocated to the general county fund, Stretford would benefit per head of population more than twice as much as Hindley though its elementary education needs are far less.36. As an illustration of the magnitude of the disturbance in the present distribution of grants which would result from crediting the general grant wholly to the general county fund, we calculate that if all the existing grants payable in the. Administrative County of Lancashire in respect of elementary education were allocated in this way, the county elementary education rate would rise by about 2s. Qd. in the   and the general county rate would fall by about 3*-. Lytham St. Anne&apos;s, the richest Part III authority in England and Wales, with a total expenditure on elementary education equivalent to a rate of only Is. 4td. in the   would have a net reduction in rates of about 2s. 5d. This would mean in effect that this area would pay nothing for elementary education and would receive a large subsidy from the county in addition. On the other hand Heywood, one of the poorest Part III areas in Lancashire, with a total expenditure on this service equivalent to a rate of about 8s., would find its rates, already high, increased by 1.?. 4d. in the  .37. While the above figures relate to cases of a somewhat extreme character, the effect of allocating the whole, or the major part, of the general grant to the general county fund would involve a serious disturbance in the existing incidence of rates in many other counties involving changes, moreover, which could hardly be represented as tending towards a more equitable distribution of rate-burdens. We feel ourselves therefore driven to the conclusion that that portion of the general grant which is to be allocated to the Part III authorities and to the county elementary education account respectively must be substantially equivalent to the existing grants for elementary education.38. We have given careful consideration to the question whether this allocation should be made upon a similar formula to that adopted for the distribution of the national grant among county areas. On the assumption that such a formula would have to cover also the distribution of grant monies among minor police and health authorities as well as Part III education authorities, it would necessarily be much more complicated than the national formula, as it would have to deal with variations not only in local needs and in ability to provide for them, but also in the number of services to be provided by the grant receiving authorities. We have not, however, deemed it necessary to explore the possibility of overcoming the practical difficulties because we have had brought to our notice an important objection in principle to proceeding in this way.39. Any formula would almost inevitably have to apply to the whole grant allotted to an Administrative County under the national formula, and consequently any new money that may be made available would tend to be allocated in proportion to the present &quot;distribution of money in a county. This would imply, inter alia, that educational development in the future ought to take the form of a general advance by all authorities equally, and, although it is no doubt inopportune at the present time to make a direct attack upon the Part III authorities, it is of the utmost importance that the change in the grant system which we contemplate should not be made the occasion for extending the field of their activities, at any rate to the prejudice of the County Authorities. &quot;The question of post-primary education, for example, is one which&apos;will almost certainly have to be solved by a regulation, and possibly readjust-ment, of the respective functions of the Part III and of the County Authorities, but the time is hardly ripe for any definite declaration of policy in regard to this vexed question.
C b oDuring the recant emergency, an Order was issued requiring Local Authorities to undertake duties with regard to the control of coal, but no express power was given to trade in coal.    The Ministry of Mines, in a Circular of the 19th June,  1926, relating to coal imported by the Government, stated &quot;local Authorities should preferably arrange to obtain and distribute imported coal through the coal factors and coal merchants;   failing this, the Authority should itself take steps to obtain and distribute the coal.&quot;   Some Local Authorities did so, and their expenses were sanctioned by me under the Local Authorities dispenses) Act. where application was made.3.     I suggest that the Government should resist the applications made by Liverpool and West Bromwich, and that the two Councils should be asked to withdraw their proposals and be told that, If they do not do so, the Government will oppose the Bills.If the Councils persist in pressing for the powers, it would then be necessary to block the Second Beading, and put on the Government Whips should the matter be taken to a Division.I understand that the Liverpool Bill is to be introduced in the House of Lords, and the West Bromwich Bill in the Commons.B.C2nd February. 1927
