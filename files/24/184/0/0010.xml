CABINET. Copy No. K\Co-operative Selling in the Coal Industry. Memorandum by the President^ of the Board of Trade.The Secretary for Mines has already put before the Coal Committee a memorandum (R.C.C.99) on the report of Sir F. Lewis&apos;s Committee.    I wished my colleagues to have the independent views of the Secretary for Mines before them especially as he will not be back in England before a decision is taken (though they do not coincide with mine).    He suggests that we should adopt a middle course, and express our willingness to legislate at a future date, in accordance with the recommendations of the Report, if it is found that voluntary action has failed to secure district selling associations in all districts.    This means approval in principle of the recommendations of the Report, and commits us irrevocably to legislation.I take a different view.    I agree that it is plainly in the interest of the coalmining industry to form district selling syndicates, and for those selling syndicates to make mutual arrangements outside their own districts.    I think, however, that we should reject the proposal to compel dissentient coalowners by legislation to join selling syndicates, and that we should say so definitely.    My reasons for this view are as follows(l) Legislation of this kind should only be undertaken if the case for it is irrosistible.    I believe this is sound policy, and it is certainly the Conservative point of view.(2) The Lewis Committee themselves admit that the formation of syndicates is primarily a matter for the industry itself.    They say (p.5) &quot;we wish to say that in our opinion the development of co-operation in marketing ooal, or any other
1 n tcommodity, is primarily a matter of commercial negotiation between the individual businesses concerned, which they themselves can best initiate and carry through.    The coal-mining industry, like other Industries, must rely very largely upon its own resources in. this respect&quot; .       An industry may not conduct its own business in its own best interests) but is it the function of the Government to force it to conduct its business on lines which it is not prepared to adopt voluntarily? Such arguments lead us perilously near to nationalisation; for, observe, what it is proposed we should do is not to put restrictions upon an Industry in the national interest, but to force it to conduct its business in what the Government alleges is the best way,(3) It will certainly be Baid, and with some truth, by all the opponents of the Bill that its object is to make coal dear, an allegation which will be admitted by some of the Bill&apos;s supporters.    Industrial usors will object to the Bill as forcing coalowners to raise prices to them; coalowners who object to the Bill have already based their objections on this ground in the ivlinority Report.    Coalowners and miners who support the Bill are bound to admit that their desire for It is not based merely, or chiefly, on the prospects of economies in selling) it is based on a desire not to let coal prices fall below a certain level - not a very attractive object of compulsion.(4) District associations, until they are completely co-ordinated one with another, will, in fact, tend to put up-the price of coal against local Industries, because railway rates will give each in its own district a semi-protected market.   They will still, on the other hand, be bled by the Railway Companies and big public utility companies, who can draw supplies from several areas and play one district against another.     If this is true, -we shall be helping to raise
prices where they ought to be lowered - i.e. to the competitive industries - and to keep them low where they ought to be higher - i.e, to the sheltered public services.(5) The Lewis Committee admit that safeguards will be essential to protect the community.      They say - and rightly - that it was not their business to devise these safeguards; but it would certainly be the Government&apos;s business, and I shudder to think what those safeguards would be.    The Committee think that the combines would be reasonable, I do not suppose they would be very unreasonable, but they would tend to raise their prices just in the wrong direction, as I have indicated above i   Moreover, the real security that the members of a combine will not bleed the public would no longer be present.    That security is that any member of the combine is free to leave if prices are too high, and he can make good profits outside; but here,by legislation, we are to compel him to go in and to stay in.-(6) We should therefore be driven to devise safeguards, But whether we devise them or not, the Government would, in effect, become responsible for the price of coal.    I cannot imagine anything more unfortunate or unpopular.    How&apos; unhappy would be the position of a Government which had oither to agree to a rise in price or to be held responsible for a strike.    In the building trade, we have already seen remarkable unanimity on the part of the master builders and the operatives to join together to raiso prices.    We might at last see the Mining Association and the Miners Federation united - in order to bleed the public under the aegis of the Government, or to hold the Government responsible for a strike if the Government refused to becoerced.    It will be remembered that the minors have-frequently urged that higher prices are the solution of all difficulties.
(7) With the approval of the Government, I have consistently maintained the position that reasonable combinations promoted efficiency, and on the whole made for cheapness and good service.      I have resisted harassing trust legislation and inquiries on the ground that combinations were economically sound, and that, as they operated in the public oye, if a combination acted unreasonably, it would pay one or more efficient members to sever their connection and to acquire thereby a goodwill and an increased trade.    But if we are to force the coal trade into a combination and keep it there, this position can no longer be maintained.(8) We must consider the effect on other industries. There are already some undesirable price fixing associations -eego the light castings association, which is only kept in check by a committee on building materials which the Minister of Health and I appointed, which publishes prices.    There are also, I believe,some associations in the smaller metal trades, where the existence of the association fetters initiative and deters the more enterprising members from, going out and doing a bigger trade at a lower cost,    All these rings will be encouraged in their worst ways.    In other industries a difficulty similar to the coal difficulty must be met.    Already a proposal is on foot in the cotton trade for a yarn price fixing association.    If a minority is to be coerced in coal, why not in yarn?(9) It is alleged in the Report that the coal selling syndicate cannot be successful unless there    is power to coerce a 25% minority.    But why is this necessary in the coal trade and not in other trades?    The cotton yarn spinners propose to go to allotment if V5;i of tho spindles agree.    If this is practicable in yarn, why not in coal?
(10) Foreign sales are to be left out, and the compulsory price ring is to be confinod to home sales.   But if we combine to exploit anyone, surely we ought to combine to exploit the foreigner,    I would remind the Cabinet that the Coal Commissioner specifically recommended combinations for exporto   True, they contemplated associations in the home trade? but they thought those associations would not be so comprehensive as to create a monopoly and prejudice the consumer.(ll) Finally, we are invited to pass legislation altering the law in respect of restraint of trade in the interest of these combinations.    Surely,we 3hould put ourselves in a curious position if, at a time when we are proposing to limit the privileges of trade unions, we created new privileges for a trust and then forced people into that trust.I would ask for a decision at an early date, as we shall undoubtedly, have to announce our policy as soon as the House meets.P.C-L.14.1.27.Board of Trade.

REPORTTo Colonel The Et. Hon. G. R. Lane Fox, M.P.I. Introduction .The question of co-operation by coal producers in selling their coal was considered by the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry (1925) under the Chairmanship of Sir Herbert Samuel.The &quot; Samuel Commission,&quot; after examining the question of distribution and distribution costs, suggested as one of a series of measures for &quot; narrowing the distributors margins without exposing the consumer to exploitation by monopolies &quot; thatthe collieries would be well advised to establish Co-operative Selling Associations. The creation in the future of the larger undertakings which we envisage should make this easier. The Associations are not likely to become so comprehensive as to stop any competition within the industry and so to prejudice the interests of the consumer by establishing a monopoly. But the present system of selling appears to carry competition to excess.&quot; The Commission went on to say &quot; Selling Associations of this nature would play a useful part in organising the pools of rail-way wagons of which mention is made in the chapter of this Report that deals with Conveyance, and on which reliance must be placed for reducing the waste now caused by the excessive shunting of mineral wagons.&quot; &quot; In the exporting districts the Associations are especially needed. Their function would be to maintain prices at a remunerative level in those foreign markets where the competition is not so much between British and foreign exporters, as among the British exporters themselves. If the industry succeeded in creating organisations for the pur-pose it is possible that it could secure the co-operation of the existing German Kartell in an arrangement to prevent the prices of coal in neutral markets from again falling to unremunerative levels.&quot;   (Pages 93-94 of the Report, Cmd. 2600.)The Commission summarised its recommendations on the point as follows : &quot; The industry as a whole has so far failed to realise the benefits to be obtained by a readiness to co-operate.   Large financial advantages might be gained by the formation, in particular,   of   co-operative   selling  agencies.     They  are specially needed in the&apos;export trade.&quot;   (Page 234 of Report.) It was out of these recommendations that our inquiry arose. We were appointed on 22nd July, 1926, as members of a Com-mittee &quot; to inquire into and report upon the desirability and prac-practicability of developing co-operative selling in the coal-mining industry, and to make recommendations.&quot;We have endeavoured to discharge this difficult duty to the best of our ability.   But in presenting this Report we wish to
say that in our opinion the development of co-operation in marketing coal, or any other commodity, is primarily a matter of commercial negotiation between the individual businesses concerned, which they themselves can best initiate and carry through. The coal-mining industry, like other industries, must rely very largely upon its own resources in this respect.At the outset of its inquiry, the Committee was in doubt whether its terms of reference were a direction to inquire into co-operative selling from the point of view of the coal-mining industry only, or to investigate also its possible effects on the interests of coal distributors and consumers and on the national interests. The Committee put the matter to you and you in-formed it that while the Government had no desire to limit the terms of reference in any way which the Committee might think would impede its usefulness, yet what the Government had in mind was that the Committee should look at the desirabilitv of co-operative selling from the standpoint of the coal-mining industry itself, and that the composition of the Committee would hardly be suitable to consider the wider question.We have accordingly limited our inquiry and have not sought information except from within the coal-mining industry, but our conclusions are based on the obvious fact that the well-being of the coal-mining industry and the well-being of the nation go hand-in-hand, and that the coal-mining industry cannot exploit the consumer without, in the long run, harming the nation and harming itself.We have interpreted the term &apos;.&apos; co-operative selling &quot; widely, placing more emphasis on the first word than on the second. Although normal competition in selling may be the greatest stimulus to efficiency, its excess may lead to price-wars, over-pro-duction, deterioration in the quality of goods and other evils, and in some cases to the mutual destruction of the competitors. We shall therefore include in our survey the various kinds of organisa-tion within the industry which seek, by joint action, to mitigate the evil effects of excessive competition, whether their methods be to guard against a &quot; price-war &quot; by regulating prices, againstover-production &quot; by regulation of output or against &quot; over-lapping &quot; by allocation of markets : or to eliminate competition among a number of producers by pooling their sales. In so doing, we shall try not to lose sight of the main object of our inquiry, which is not to suggest the policy which a marketing combination in the coal industry might pursue, but to examine the question of setting up an organisation which would make it possible for the industry to have a reasoned policy at all.Since the term &quot; co-operative selling &quot; is capable of being interpreted in a narrower sense than we have given it, and used only in connexion with combinations which themselves act as selling agencies for their members, we shall generally prefer to use in our report the wider term &quot; organised marketing.&quot;U02S7 a
II. Methods and extent of Organised Marketing in the Coal-Mining Industry of the United Kingdom.We shall endeavour in this section of our Report to describe in general terms the methods of organised marketing which have at different times been practised or attempted in the coal-mining industry and to give some general indication of their respective limitations and possibilities and their present extent.Except for a few historical references, we shall not identify these methods of organised marketing by reference to the associations and organisations which have attempted to make use of them. To do so is not essential to our purpose and might create prejudice and embarrassment. In the present state of law and public opinion some of the methods of organised market-ing are apt to be summarily and often wrongly condemned as nothing more than restraint of trade and attempts at profiteering.Methods. We shall classify methods of organised market-ing according as they are primarily concerned with (1) prices, (2) output, (3) allocation of markets, and (4) sales. These methods are not mutually exclusive and are sometimes combined.(1) Prices. The object is to mitigate the effect of competition in selling more particularly on a falling market by agreeing upon minimum selling prices. This is done either informally by a &quot; Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement,&quot; e.g., by conferences among salesmen; or formally by setting up an association and investing it in legal form with power to impose penalties on any of its members who transgress its rules.In respect of each grade or quality of coal, a minimum price at the pit is fixed separately for each colliery, based usually upon the prices actually realised over a pre-determined test period. The rate of wagon hire is standardised. Alternatively, the minimum prices are laid down as a schedule of &quot; delivered prices &quot; to each market covered by the Agreement.Flat rate additions or reductions are made annuallv or at shorter intervals.In order to render the prices real and not nominal, discounts and rebates are regulated. With a view to ensuring that the agreement is carried out, the Association is given powers to check prices against qualities and grades.The main benefit of an arrangement of this kind to its members is to regulate competition among them. It cannot secure to them better prices than those realised by their neighbours outside the association, or by competitors in other coalfields, and the attempt to do so has been the cause of the downfall of many price asso-ciations in the industry, e.g., the Limitation of the Vend, the Durham Coal Sales Association, and the Lancashire and Cheshire Sales Organisation. In face of competition, these associations held their prices too long, with the result that some of the&apos; members found themselves unable to sell their coal at the prices fixed and the associations collapsed.   Other causes of weakness
seem to have been the difficulty of preventing or detecting eva-sions of the agreement; and a failure or inability to apply effec-tively the guarantees and penalties of the articles of association, which was partly due, no doubt, to fears that the courts would hold the contracts invalid, as being &quot; in restraint of trade.&quot;Short of general price fixing arrangements in a district there have been arrangements for the co-ordination of tenders and forward contracts in respect of particular classes of sales, e.g., locomotive, coal, gas coal, and house coal.(2) Output. The object is to regulate output to the degree necessary to stabilize prices. The two general methods of output regulation are :  (a) The Pool System. Each member is allotted, on the basis of his ascertained output, a certain percentage of the total output of the members of the association. At the end of each accounting period the amount actually produced by each member is expressed as a percentage of the total pro-duction of all; and members who are found to have fallen short, of their allotted percentage are compensated on some agreed basis by those who exceeded it.(b) The Quota System. Proportions are allotted as before, but the total output, and therefore the individual output with it, is determined in advance by the Association according to the trend of the market.The pool system is the more flexible, but to some extent it leaves its members to speculate on the course of the demand.In the coal-mining industry output regulation has been but little practised, and then only to stabilise and reinforce a price agreement. In 1896 Mr. D. A. Thomas (the late Lord Rhondda) made a strong effort to induce the owners of the best steam coal pits to enter into an output association on the pool system without control of prices, but the scheme had to be dropped for lack of support. The quota system has not been practised by British coal owners since the Limitation of the Vend, and we must turn for an example to the Rhenish Westphalian Syndicate, which is described in the Appendix to this Report.Output regulation seems only to have been attempted in this country in the more fully developed coal-mining areas where the production of the different mines was fairly stable and the broad object of the owners was to maintain unchanged their relative shares of the market. It has not been attempted in coalfields in course of development, where it would be necessary to face the difficulties of adapting it to an expanding output.In one instance the regulation of output was only applied to coal sold in the local marketing area, and protected by freights to some extent against the competition of adjoining coalfields. The reason of this no doubt was that any limitation of sales by only one group of suppliers to a freely competitive market would provide rather a bonus to their competitors than a benefit to themselves.(i()2S7
(3) Markets. The object is to mitigate competition by allocat-ing markets between different groups or associations of colliery companies. Group X is given preferential rights to sell in market A on condition that it restricts its activities in market B, and con-adversely, Group Y is given preferential rights in market B on con-dition that it restricts its activities in market A. The effective scope of price/output regulation by a local association is widened if it can come to an arrangement of this kind with neighbouring associations, through the medium, for example, of a co-ordinating federation of associations.This method has been practised to a very limited extent and only in respect of high quality coals for special uses.(4) Sales. A number of colliery owners set up a central selling agency to sell their coal. The object is to eliminate competition in selling between the members and equally or even - more important to effect the economies naturally associated with larger selling units, including the amalgamation of selling staff, pooling of railway wagons, ability to undertake the loading of large vessels with homogeneous cargoes, etc.The method has many advantages over those already described, but is not likely to be workable except where there is a close association and community of interest between the constituent colliery companies, such as can be brought about by unified control and by an interlocking of directorates and finance.In certain negotiations for a local selling organisation, the pro-posal was made that the association should nominally conduct the sales, but that every member should have the right to sell his own coal as agent for the association, if he so desired. In the event of any breach of the regulations, the association (in addition to imposing money penalties) was to have the right to cancel the member&apos;s agency.Pooled selling of a different kind is practised in the sense that the whole output from a number of independent collieries may-be sold regularly through the same factor; or exporter. This is not pooled selling by the collieries, and any resulting economies or gains are likely to accrue to the agent rather than to the prin-cipals.The Present Position. Some of the co-operative marketing arrangements in che industry lapsed during the war. Negotia-tions with the object of reviving and even extending them are, we are informed, actively in progress in many of the inland trade coalfields; and we note with interest that a selling pool, con-trolling an output of some 4,000,000 tons a year, was set up in South Yorkshire as recently as October last. We are glad to learn that extensive developments of co-operative marketing on the same lines, and as one of the fruits of amalgamation, are likely to occur in this coalfield in the near future.For reasons already indicated, we do not think it advisable to particularise the existing arrangements, but we may say gener-ally that, at the present time, organised marketing in the coal
mining industry, apart from the South Yorkshire coalfield, goes little further than price agreements of an informal character, few in number and limited in scope.As yet, the industry on its marketing side is probably less organised than any other important industry of the country against the effects of excessive internal competition in selling and of organised buying by its customers. Market-ing arrangements are numerous in the iron and steel industry, in the electrical industries and in the chemical industries. The Rubber Scheme and the price fixing scheme and selling organisation just set up by spinners of American cotton yarn are fresh in the public mind. Particulars of many other industries in which marketing arrangements are in operation will be found in the Report of the Committee on Trusts which was appointed in February 1918, (Cd. 9236) ; and in the series of some fifty Reports, published in 1920 and 1921, of investigations under the Profiteering Acts by the Joint Committees on Prices and Trusts.It is true that many of these arrangements have had a chequered existence and that some of them have collapsed, but the persistence with which they are continued or reorganised in face of difficulties is a measure of the value attached to them by the industries concerned.III. The German Coal Kartells.The individualism of coal marketing in this country is in striking contrast with the methods followed in Germany where the marketing of coal is completely organised in a national system of coal &quot; kartells &quot; under which production is regulated, and sales are conducted not by the individual colliery companies but by large and co-ordinated selling pools.We publish in the Appendix to this report a short account  compiled mainly from published information of the origin, con-stitution and working of the Rhenish-Westphahan Coal Syndicate and of the machinery set up under the German Imperial Coal Law of 1919 to co-ordinate and control the coal kartells of Germany and to protect the interests of German coal consumers.There seems to be a consensus of opinion that the Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate, from its inception in 1893, has served the Ruhr coal industry well and has, in the main, achieved its declared object, &quot; to put an end to unhealthy competition in the coal market.&quot; Under its regime, coal mining in the Ruhr and the coal ex-port trade of the Ruhr have developed rapidly and fairly evenly. Inland prices have been steadied* against the effects of trade booms and slumps, and more regular working of the mines has been secured. In these and other ways the development of the Ruhr coal mining industry has been regulated to its own advantage* a comparison between the average yearly prices of British and. German coal before and after the operation of the Syndicate is suggestive. From 1883 to 1894 the British and German prices almost coincided ; after 1894 the German prices showed a much narrower range of fluctuation than the British prices.
and generally speaking to the benefit of German industry. These are the main advantages claimed. They are of the first importance and we have no reason to doubt that they have been realised to a high degree.But there is another side to the picture. The Rhenish-West-phalian Coal Syndicate-at any rate for the first 20 years of its life held over a large area of Germany almost a complete monopoly in the supply of coal. It was under no effective State or other control, and it employed all the devices of a powerful trust to strengthen its position. Its methods of business were autocratic and in some respects, it may have been thought, harsh and oppressive. It ruled the coal distributing trade from top to bottom and at times it was vigorously accused by consuming interests of profiteering.Its relations with the Prussian Government (see the Appendix) are significant. Tor many years it seems openly and successfully to have fought against the efforts of the Prussian Government to control its activities and protect consuming interests, and it was only- the intervention of the European war which put any check on its almost sovereign power.These are matters which, strictly speaking, are outside the scope of our enquiry, limited as it is to looking at the matter from the point of view of the coal mining industry only, but we feel bound to mention them as being of vital importance to the nation in considering any proposal for setting up a comprehensive coal selling organisation in this country.A compensating fact, which is also significant from the point of view of the coal mining industry, is that the Rhenish-Westphalian Syndicate, while maintaining a solid front to coal distributors and consumers, has been threatened from time to time with collapse from competition and from a growing incom-patibility of interest between sections of its members.Competition seems to have been dealt with fairly successfully; it was partly prevented by large purchases of undeveloped mining properties and of shares in mining companies, and partly eliminated by offering acceptable terms of absorption to eom-competing undertakings. Nevertheless an element of competition remained, sufficient to be at times an embarrassment to the Syndicate.The main internal dissensions have been : (a) in respect of fixing output quotas fairly and adapting them to changing conditions; and(6) between the &quot; pure mines &quot; producing coal mainly for sale through the Syndicate and the &quot; mixed mines&quot; supplying coal in the main direct to associated works (such as iron and steel works) and not selling it through the Syndicate. The difficulties arising, which are explained in the Appendix, increased as the interests of the mixed mines expanded and became more and more powerful within the Syndicate, and the methods of dealing with them have, by force of circumstances, become most intricate and involved.
These elements of instability were removed by legislation (the German Coal Law of 1919) which in effect made the continuance of this and the other German coal syndicates compulsory.Another consideration of fundamental importance arises on the method of output control which is followed by the Rhenish-West -phalian Syndicate (see the Appendix). In effect, so long as the productive capacity of the mines exceeds the demand for coal and output limitation has accordingly- to be exercised, the newer developing mines are held in check; they are only permitted to increase their output by paying compensation to other mines for the privilege of taking over all or part of their output quotas. This check on development has been held by some to be harmful as tending to retard the natural result of competition, which is that the more modern mines, producing at a lower cost, force the older mines out of business. Others hold to the contrary, that older mines are more effectively and speedily eliminated by pay-ing them to go out of business than by the ordinary method of competitive extinction which in practice is slow, uncertain in operation and often only temporarily effective. Mines in difficulties hold on even at a loss : or they close down temporarily and re-open on the market improving, and after the boom has subsided their endeavours to obtain a market for their economic output cause damage to the iudustry out of all proportion to the relative quantity of coal they produce.IV. The Case for Organised Marketing.Having briefly sketched the aims and methods of organised marketing, we are now in a position to consider what advantages might be gained, and what disabilities overcome, by the adoption of such a system in the coal mining industry of this country. The case in favour, as it has been laid before us by its advocates, may be summarised as follows.The coal mining industry   like most other industries but to a greater degree than many suffers from the effects of booms and slumps in general trade. Periods of keen demand and good prices, stimulating production, are followed by periods of depression ; demand slackens and there is fierce competition to sell and a heavy fall in prices before pro-duction is adjusted to demand.The phenomenon of the failure of an un-co-ordinated industry to reduce output to the limits of demand, before instead of after a slump in prices, is common and well-known and need not be examined in detail. On a falling market, the individual producer is faced with the alternatives of reducing his output thereby increasing his cost of production when he particularly wants to reduce it or of keeping his cost of production as low as possible by spreading his standing charges over a maximum output. His personal advantage seems clearly to lie in following the second course, for, he may argue, a reduction of output by one unit out
of many will effect no appreciable reduction in the aggregate out-put and cannot therefore check the fall in prices. But many other producers have just the same inducement and if many act in this way they defeat one another&apos;s ends: the market is temporarily over-supplied and prices are forced down to a point where the belated curtailment of production can no longer be avoided.The phenomenon is one of excessive individualism and it can only be controlled by concerted action for temporarily but promptly adjusting production to a reduced demand.These difficulties of temporary over-production have been successfully met not only by the coal mining industry of Germany but also by other industries in this country ; and the advocates of organised marketing suggest that unless the British coal mining industry also can organise itself to meet them the price of coal must continue to fluctuate excessively to the detriment of both capital and labour in the industry, of its customers, and indeed, of the nation.(1) Capital. It is stated by the Samuel Commission (see Chapter 20 of the Eeport) that even before the war the average return to capital in the Coal Mining Industry, which it is fair to regard as a highly speculative one, was relatively low. The industry, like all others, requires fresh capital for improve-ments and new technical methods and for development. The cheaper the rate at which such capital can be obtained the better for all concerned in the industry. The stabilisation of prices at a reasonably remunerative level, which is essential from this point of view, cannot be ensured except by the organisation of marketing in such a way as to prevent the market from being demoralized periodically by a few weak sellers, who force down the level of prices quite unnecessarily.(2) Labour. The wages of coal miners are governed to a large extent by the prices realised for coal and we are informed by their representatives on the committee that -there is a wide-spread feeling among the miners not only that wages are unneces-sarily depressed by the way in which excessive competition forces these prices down, but also that some of the proceeds of coal sales which equitably ought to go into the colliery revenue and so into the wages ascertainment, are taken by subsidiary selling com-panies. They claim that the resulting discontent would be mitigated-gated if marketing at the collieries themselves were effectively organised and if the miners were given more information as to the marketing side of the industry and a reasonable assurance that destructive competition had been eliminated.The greater uniformity of prices, it is suggested, would tend to stabilise the proceeds of the Industry, and this in turn would lessen fluctuations in wages, whether they are regulated by a system of ascertainments similar to that set up in 1921, or on the pre-war basis of a. sliding scale of selling prices.   To maintain
wages at a more uniform level would, in itself, be a powerful aid towards establishing better relations between Capital and Labour in the industry.(3) The coal consumer. It is claimed that it is not in the interests of coal consumers that the price of coal should fluctuate widely, and that it is more important for large consumers of coal in estimating their costs and laying down programmes of increased production to have some assurance that the price of coal will remain fairly constant, than to gain the temporary advantage of being able to buy for a time at less than the economic price and then to have to make up for it by paying a much higher price at a time of boom. There is no real or permanent advantage to the consumer or the community at large in getting coal or any other article for a time at a price so low as to involve the producers in loss : the consumer will have to make up the loss sometime, and over a period of years the average price must be one that gives an adequate margin of profit to the producers.The stabilization of prices would also be an encouragement to purchasers to cover their supplies over lengthy periods to the benefit of both the colliery industry and the large consumer.(4) Export Trade.- No national marketing organisation could in itself control the price of coal in international markets, but it would nevertheless be of advantage in co-ordinating sales in such markets. It is claimed, from general knowledge of the trade, that export prices are depressed not only by foreign competition, but also by competition of different British exporting areas against each other in the same export market, and by competition among colliery companies in the same exporting area and among exporters. This unnecessary competition could be eliminated by a marketing organisation. In so far as it may result in providing foreign competitors of our manufacturing industries with cheaper coal, it is harmful not only to the coal mining industry, but to the industries of the country generally.It is also maintained that it is increasingly necessary to create an organisation capable of negotiating agreements with foreign organisations for the regulation of international competition. The tendency of international trade in coal, as well as in other commodities, is that the advantages of different national pro-ducers over each other become smaller and competition becomes more intense ; for this reason international agreements for the regulation of trade are to-day increasingly prominent. The International Steel Kartell is a very recent example.(5) Economies between Producer and Consumer. The econ-omies which have been represented to us as attainable by a general system of organised marketing fall under the following heads : (a) Prom  pooling of  wagons and   traffic co-ordination generally ; &apos;
(b) From centralisation of selling staffs, commercial travellers, &amp;c.;(c) From co-ordinated and more effective bargaining with the distributing trades;(d) From a measure of assignment of orders and markets to the collieries and districts most favourably situated to execute them, and from the consequent saving of cross freights.It is argued that an effective colliery marketing association in conference with representatives of the distributing trades should be able to agree with the latter upon measures for economies in distribution costs, and the elimination of speculation. Consoli-dation of selling interests on the colliery side would also tend to bring about a corresponding consolidation of buying interests on the distributing side. Such a consolidation, as a means of effecting economies in distribution costs, was recommended by two coal owners&apos; representatives and three other leading men of industry in the following terms in one of the Reports of the Coal Industry (Sankey) Commission : &quot; Wherever consolida-tion of the present distributing agencies is possible it should be effected, but not so as to result in combinations or trusts to the detriment of the consumer.&quot; (Vol. 2, page XIX, paragraph 51 Cmd. 360.)We have not considered it to be part of our duty to investigate the question of distribution costs, or the probability (apart from any saving on these under existing methods of coal marketing), of effecting economies by consolidation of the present distribute-ing agencies; and we express no opinion on any of these matters. The Samuel Commission quite recently and earlier commissions and committees of inquiry have investigated these matters thoroughly and expressed the opinion that some savings ought to be possible, and we confine ourselves to saying that an effective marketing organisation among colliery companies would be able, as individual companies are not, to deal with these problems on broad business lines.These economies of marketing would only be fully attainable by a system of pooled sales.&apos; The economies possible under a price/output control organisation, leaving ea&quot;ch colliery to con-tinue its own sales, would necessarily be narrower.(6) Other advantages claimed. The following incidental aid-vantages, over and above the advantages of price stabilisation and economies in distribution, are cited by the supporters of organised marketing.(a) The more speedy elimination of the less economic pits under a system of output control. As in Germany, the more economic and profitable pits would find it worth their while to purchase, and add to their own output quotas, the output quotas of the less economic and less profitable pits. The out-put quota system defines a specific asset of a colliery namely
its markets in such a way as to ensure that other collieries can purchase it with full security that they will be able to realise its value. Without an output quota, the purchaser of a colliery has no definite security that he will obtain its markets, which may in fact fall to his competitors.(b) Improved grading and preparation of coal for the market.  The importance of this subject was emphasised by the Samuel Commission (page 94 of its Report). The Commission expressed the opinion that the cleaning, grading, sizing, and blending of coal should receive increased attention from the mining industry, and that the sale of coal to specification would be of considerable benefit to the industry in many cases. A marketing organisation would be in a position to co-ordinate arch matters to the advantage of its members even though it did not conduct their actual sales. If it were selling agent for its members, it would, for convenience and, indeed, practic-ability of working, standardise the classification and sizing of coal and sell coal to specification to the maximum degree corn-patible with meeting the wishes of its customers. It would arrange for its members individually to prepare their coal to such standards as would best enable it to meet the changing needs of the market, and so, in their joint interests, secure tiie best net return from sales.In Germany a system of additions to and deductions from the standard prices at which the coal is taken over for sale by the Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate according as the coal is well or ill prepared for market is reported to have brought about considerable improvement in the preparation of coal.(c) Technical marketing propaganda e.g., on the effective utilisation of coal in competition with other prime sources of power.The oil fuel industry has very effectively organised its rnarket-ing propaganda, and it behoves the coal-mining industry to advance on similar lines.V. The Case against Organised Marketing.There is a strong body of opinion in the coal-mining industry and in this Committee which is firmly convinced that any regula-tion of coal output or prices, so far from benefiting the coal-mining industry, would be harmful, if not disastrous, to the industry and also to the nation. Its views, as laid before us, may be summarized as follows :  For 50 years and more, up to 1913, coal mining was a prosperous and expanding industry and fresh markets were found for its increasing output at prices sufficiently remunera-tive to attract the requisite capital and labour. It is true that, for a speculative industry, the average return on the capital invested was low, but not so low as to check development or technical improvement.
Since and because of the War the conditions of the industry have been abnormal; its markets have been dislocated and its normal expansion checked. This check is not permanent and, if coal can be produced and sold sufficiently cheaply, the opponents of organized marketing entertain no doubt that markets both at home and abroad will again be found sufficient to absorb the full output of a freely expanding industry. On no other basis, they hold, can this country continue to support an expanding population and to improve its standard of living. On these grounds, a policy of restriction of output which, it is generally considered, must be a basic feature of any effective marketing organisation is characterized as a policy of despair.In the home markets, the prosperity of the coal-mining industry is dependent on the prosperity of its chief customers-the &quot; heavy &quot; and other manufacturing industries which ia turn has been built upon and can only be fully restored by &quot; cheap coal.&quot; Most of these industries have to meet keen foreign competition; and any increase in the price of coal wohd impair their capacity to compete in foreign markets and (under our free trade system) to hold their own in home markets. They would lose trade instead of gaining it. The home demard for coal would fall and either the price of coal would have to be reduced or a further restriction of production would complete the vicious circle of higher prices, falling demand and con-sequently increased cost of production.In the export markets, we are told, the only effect of higher prices would be to increase the already grave losses of trade which, it is asserted, have been due not to weak or inefficient selling, but to the handicap of a higher cost of production than our competitors, exceeding the power of our supreme geographical position to overcome. The statement of the Samuel Commission that prices in export markets have been unnecessarily depressed by competition amongst British exporters is denied. The recovery and expansion of our coal export markets is vital in order to restore the balance of trade and to enable us to pur-chase cheaply the foodstuffs and raw materials necessary to our existence as a nation. The essential condition of this recovery and expansion is a low cost of production and one of the means to secure this is to. spread standing charges over the maximum output.With regard to the export trade, it is further pointed out that the British coal industry could not hope at present to negotiate any acceptable international agreement in face of the fact that it has lost a considerable part of its pre-war foreign markets and is still handicapped in those markets by a higher cost of production than its European competitors. To recover these markets, freedom of individual action is necessary, for the export trade is very sensitive to change and requires the personal touch and the promptitude of action which selling agencies cannot give.
113While, no doubt, the weak seller does sometimes depress the market, it is not weak selling but sound policy to reduce prices promptly in face of a temporarily lessened demand for coal, until a sufficient demand is stimulated to keep the collieries in full production; and it is folly to hinder the recovery of a weak market by attempting to hold up , prices against it. The inference we are asked to draw is that in everybody&apos;s interest, the workers&apos; most of all, it is better to try to regain the tem-porary loss of output quickly by reducing prices, even should it entail working at a small loss and in the long run a small reduction in wages, than to go on short time. It is better to face the loss of a few pence per ton on full sales than to face the higher cost of production which ensues when standing charges are spread over a reduced output.It is also suggested that if the coal mining industry were to set up selling organizations, consumers in self defence would set up retaliatory organisations for purchasing coal, by means of which they would render nugatory the operations of the selling organisation; or that, on the other hand, the develop-ment of substitutes for coal, such as oil and hydro-electric power, would be accelerated and that the encroachment of these upon the provinces formerly dominated by coal alone would be seriously encouraged and would become permanent.It is said to be useless to hope that the concentration of selling in the hands of agencies will affect any material saving in the selling expenses of the industry, since these expenses now are only about 2d. per ton.Finally, we are asked to see in the principle of marketing combination the vices of the protectionist system. It is a protection of profits, and would enable and tempt the organisation to raise prices against the consumer to the highest possible level. It is also a protection of wages; labour would be tempted to use it as a lever to maintain wages, and even to raise them, ultimately at the expense of the workers in the trades dependent upon coal. These trades cannot defend themselves, like those which are affected in the same - way by the operations of the German Kartell, by recourse to a national system of tariffs, but must suffer without redress.If the Government intervene to assist the coal industry to protect wages at the consumers&apos; expense, the case for similar intervention to protect wages in the more poorly remunerated industries, notably agriculture, will become unanswerable. The underlying policy is described as a mere variant of the dis-credited expedient of subsidizing the coal industry at the expense of other industries and the nation.The foregoing arguments are directed against organised marketing in itself. But it is further urged that it would be impracticable to set up any such organisation for the coal in-dustry, at any rate on a scale embracing the whole country, owing to the special difficulties arising from the conditions of the industry.
These difficulties are of two chief kinds : (i) inherent in the character of the industry ; (ii) arising from the geographical distribution of the coal-fields and the multiplicity of interests therein.(i) Difficulties inherent in the character of the industry. Coal is not, like copper or rubber, a standard or uniform product, sold at a more or less uniform price. It is a raw material of great variety, sold at many different prices, and the cost of transport is usually so large an element of its delivered price that the pit price of a single grade of coal varies from mine to mine according to the distance of the mine from its market. In these circumstances a price agreement between any con-siderable number of mines is difficult to arrange equitably&quot; and to work smoothly and lends itself readily to undetected evasion by dissatisfied members.Output agreements also are much more difficult than in other industries. The output of a manufacturing works can be governed fairly precisely and maintained indefinitely. The out-put of a mine cannot; it is to some extent at the mercy of natural forces and conditions. It increases for perhaps many years while the mine is developing and it may decrease as the mine approaches exhaustion. It must be difficult to make equitable-able allowance for these variations in regulating the relative outputs of a number of mines.(ii) Difficulties arising from the Geographical Distribution of the Coalfields. It would hardly be possible for the huge coal output of Great Britain to be marketed by a single central organisation. If it were desired to embrace the whole industry, there would have to be a series of local organisations, co-ordinated in their activities by a central authority, as there is for the smaller output of the coal industry of Germany.It is urged, however, that the German organisation is not a trustworthy model. The British coalfields are comparatively close together. They compete keenly among themselves iu most of the home markets and there is a sharp conflict of interest between the newer expanding coalfields arid the older coalfields which are past their best. The Ruhr coalfield, on the other hand, is sufficiently remote from important competing coalfields for it to have, naturally, a large monopoly market, containing many large industrial consumers, which is held the more securely owing to quality and transport advantages.Again, the geographical distribution of the British coalfields  some on or near the seaboard and some well inland imposes a natural division of the inland and export markets between them. Some collieries sell mainly in the export market; some wholly or mainly in the home market; and some in both. Some sell coal in the one market or the other as prices vary.   -The benefits to be derived by colliery owners from organised marketing would accrue mainly to the home market collieries, since it is only in the home markets that the stabilization of output and of prices could be made fully effective.
These conditions reflect a conflict and over-lapping of interest between &quot; exporting &quot; and &quot; home-market &quot; colliery companies which it must be difficult to reconcile. It would seem that inland and export markets would have to be organised separately and that each would need protection against its organisation being dislocated by the intrusion of surplus production from the other. Production and price could only be effectively stabilized in the home markets by making those markets self-contained and excluding from them coal normally exported, which better inland prices or a falling demand abroad might attract to inland markets. Similarly, the exporting collieries would expect to be protected against unexpected competition from collieries producing coal which was surplus, for the time being, to their regulated output for the inland markets.In this respect again the difficulties are much greater than in the Ruhr, where all the collieries can share more or less equally the security of the non-competitive and the perils of the competitive markets without violating the geographical con-ditions.Yet another difficulty is cited against organised marketing on an all-embracing scale, arising from the large number of separate undertakings in the British coal industry. After excluding the very small concerns employing less than a hundred men (which represent only about 2 per cent, of the total output), there remain some 700 firms; and, even making allowance for financial interdependence, there are still at least 500 mutually inde-pendent units. This, it is urged, is far too large a number to be embraced in one organisation, and one which must make even a federal scheme very difficult to organise and cumbrous to work.VI. Comments on the objections to organised marketing.We have given earnest consideration to the foregoing argu-nients : (i) We regard it as unreasonable that the coal mining industry alone, among all the industries of the country, should be regarded as debarred, on grounds of public policy, from organising its marketing. Many of its principal customers are organised ; many industries from which it has to purchase are organised, and there is no reason why it should be expected to deny itself the same advantage. It is true, no doubt, that so long as a general coal marketing organisation successfully maintained its power to stabilise output and inland prices, it could use that power illegitimately at the expense of the consumer. But, for the most part, the industries which already have such organisations, and monopolistic combines generally, in this country, have shown sufficient commercial vision to maintain a reasonable balance between the .selling prices which it is in their power to charge and the selling prices which they actually do charge.   There is surely no reason to doubt that the same
prudence would be shown by those who had to direct the opera-tions of a coal marketing organisation, namely, the coal owners themselves. They would act in the best interests of the indus-try, which would certainly not lie in killing demand by excessive prices. Moreover, they would have to take account of possible development in competition at new pits and at pits outside the organisation, and from oil fuel and other prime sources of power.Over and above these restraining influences external safeguards could be provided.Even granting that a marketing organisation might attempt to use its power tyrannically, there are worse evils even than a monopoly. There is no need for us to enlarge upon the grave losses and hardships which have been repeatedly inflicted upon the nation and its industries for some years past by the con-continually recurring disputes and stoppages in the coal mining industry. They are terribly apparent to-day. The stoppage now coming to an end has_caused hardship in every household; thousands of workers in other industries have lost all or part of their employment; the losses to industry and the nation have been enormous. Short of an actual stoppage, the mere threat or rumour of one has an unsettling and paralysing influence upon the whole trade of the nation. We believe that the organisation of its marketing would help the coal mining industry to regain its stability and would be an important contribution towards the foundations of a lasting peace in the industry. Such a develop-ment would more than compensate the home consumer for the risk of paying a little more for his coal.We do not therefore think that the argument against monopoly is final, even where it is applicable; and to district marketing organisations competing with one another it does not apply.(ii) The remaining arguments against organised marketing in itself are based on assumptions that the methods of organisation would be applied injudiciously by an unwarranted inflation in prices or restriction of output. The opponents of organised marketing seem to regard this as inevitable, but we do not agree with them.Regulation of output does not necessarily mean contraction of output. There would be nothing to prevent a marketing organisation from following a normal policy of a freely expand-ing output so long as &quot;marketing conditions permitted the Rhenish Westphalian Coal Syndicate has operated for over 30 years on a rapidly expanding output. There would be nothing to prevent it from following an export policy of the fullest pro-duction and the keenest competition with foreign countries for so long as that was considered to be in the common interest of employers and workers in the British coal trade.The particular policy to be adopted is entirely a matter for the industry itself and would have to be varied from time to time as trade conditions changed.   The fundamental advantage of
organised marketing would lie, not in the adoption of any par-ticular trade policy, but in making it practicable for the coal mining industry to choose a trade policy and to carry that policy out. At present it can have no choice of policy. It is powerless to frame any policy or to help itself in times of depression when unregulated production on a falling demand tends to result in unremunerative prices.The method of obtaining a low cost of production by spreading standing charges over maximum output is clearly sound up to a point, but not when it is carried to the length of creating such a surplus of production as will cause a serious slump in prices. It is to avoid such contingencies as this that a marketing organisation is required.It may confidently be hoped that when world trade revives the British coal mining industry can get back to its historical basis of a freely expanding output, without undue sacrifice in price. But it seems to us there can be no certainty that this will be the case. The future of trade is uncertain, and account must be taken of the expansion of the coal mining industry abroad, of the growing competition from oil fuel, lignite, and hydro-elec-tricity, of increasing economies in consumption, and of improve-ments in fuel technology. It would seem prudent for the British coal mining industry to be prepared to meet the contingency that its unregulated expansion may result in evils of over-production which a regulated growth would avoid. Apart from this, the industry would be well advised to organise itself against the temporary but serious effects on prices of booms and slumps in trade.(iii) The main argument on the score of impracticability and there is a great deal of force in it is derived from the large number of undertakings in the British coal industry.In 1923, to take a typical year, there were in the United om 1,535 colliery undertakings which may be classified as follows : Employing under 10 persons     .........      337Employing 10 and under 50 persons......      391Employing 50 and under 100 persons......        92Total employing under 100 persons     ......      820Total employing 100 persons and over......      7151,535The number of separate concerns is not quite so great as it appears to be because some of them are financially connected. The controlling interest in some is held by other colliery con-cerns; others are linked together by a controlling interest outside the industry.
Table 9 of Appendix No. 18, Samuel Commission Eeport, Vol. Ill (page 180) analyses roughly the financial connexions of 572 owners, at whose collieries 90 per cent, of the 1924 coal out-put was raised. It does not enable us to deduce how many of these nominally independent units are, in practical effect, part of a larger unit; but it enables us safely to say that there are some-thing over 500 separate units all employing 100 or more persons. These units cover about 98 per cent, of the total coal output.We agree that it would be impossible to set up a marketing organisation to cover effectively so many colliery concerns. When, however, the numbers of units are considered district by district they do not appear, in themselves, to be unmanageably large for the formation of a useful district organisation. Never-theless, there can be no doubt that if the number of units were fewer, district organisations would be easier to set up and more effective in their working.The remaining arguments against practicability suffice to show that organised marketing presents considerable difficulties, but we cannot believe that with experience and good will these diffi-culties could not in time be overcome.We do not suggest, of course, that the transition can be effected quickly or easily. There is, indeed, no royal road by which a large number of colliery companies can pass smoothly from a state of unregulated competition to an effective marketing organisa-tion. They can only do so by building from the bottom, by groupings growing in size and brought by degrees into relation-ship and agreement. German experience emphasises that pro-gress is likely to be gradual. The Ehenish Westphalian Coal Syndicate was no sudden creation, but the culmination of a series of output and price conventions which the coal owners attempted to work together for a period of fourteen years prior to the for-mation of the syndicate in 1893. Though these conventions had a limited success, they must have afforded useful experience, knowledge, and training in the atmosphere of output and price regulation. The constitution of the syndicate was, moreover, based directly upon that of the Ehenish Coke Syndicate, formed in 1890,- which was itself the outcome of 18 years&apos; &quot;experience of price and output regulation.We agree that the export trade presents a separate problem, and we shall have certain suggestions to offer when we come to our recommendations.
VII.-CONCLU sick  S.(a) The. Principle of Organised Marketing.After carefully considering and analysing the various argu-ments for and against the development of organised marketing in the coal-mining industry, we have come definitely to the opinion that, in principle, such a development would be beneficial to the industry. Organised marketing is increasingly recognised as an effective method of avoiding excessive competition, of achieving economies and improvements in marketing and of help-ing to stabilize an industry. In one form or another it has been widely adopted in many other industries in this country and in the coal-mining industry of Germany. It seems to us clear that the British coal-mining industry also could make effective use of it.But we feel that a serious impediment lies in the present lack of consolidation in the industry ; and we are convinced that the full development and benefits of organised marketing within the industry cannot be realized unless the industry can be consoli-dated, by amalgamations, into a much smaller number of units. This raises a wider question than the one we have been asked to consider and it is no part of our duty to express an opinion about the practicability or desirability of amalgamations on other grounds than that of developing organised marketing. On that ground amalgamations are in our opinion urgently necessary and desirable.There is no consensus of opinion among colliery owners generally in regard to the desirability of organised marketing. In some areas, particularly in the chief exporting areas, the balance of opinion is decidedly against the principle. In other districts, which have a mainly inland market, there is consider-able, although not unanimous, support. In the remaining districts opinion appears to be more or less equally divided. The present scope for voluntary organisation of coal marketing is therefore limited; we shall consider later the question of countenancing a limited measure of compulsion to facilitate the setting up of district organisations.(b) Local and District Organisations.(i) Local Organisation. The least comprehensive form of marketing organisation but not necessarily the least effective  is that set up between several neighbouring colliery owners who either make some form of price arrangement to avoid undue competition one with another, or combine to obtain the economies and other substantial marketing advantages of a local selling pool. The potentialities of local arrangements such as -these are limited by the unabated competition of neighbouring and other colliery owners selling in the same markets. Nevertheless, they serve a valuable purpose both in themselves and in preparing for a closer physical co-operation between the collieries concerned.  They also
open a way towards a more comprehensive marketing organisa-tion to cover the whole district or coalfield. We, therefore, advocate the development of local marketing arrangements, and in particular we make an emphatic recommendation in favour of the organisation, wherever practicable, of local selling pools on the general lines of those already in operation in the South Yorkshire coalfield.(ii; District Organisation. The district organisation, by which we mean an organisation to co-ordinate the marketing of coal over the whole of a coalfield or other economically-defined selling area, has more effective scope than a local organisation for influencing the market, but not to the extent of raising any sub-stantial objection on the ground of monopoly. If it is working independently, and is not co-ordinated with other district asso-ciations by an overriding central committee, it can have no effective monopoly; its operations are kept fairly strictly within legitimate bounds by actual or potential competition.From the standpoint of the interest of the industry we regard the development of district associations as desirable, and we recommend accordingly. But we think it desirable also that price-output organisations, in their own interests as well as in the interest of the consumer, should have (as selling pools have intrinsically) a constructive side to their activities as well as a merely defensive or protective policy. Mere price-output regula-tion tends to become an argumentative business, and the members of a district marketing organisation are more likely to work and hold together effectively if thej&apos; make common cause, as well, in more inspiring activities directed to achieving greater efficiency in transport and distribution.A district association might also be helpful in organising pools of wagons among its members, and in co-ordinating improvements in the preparation of coal for the market. On the side of econo-mies in production a district marketing organisation cannot he directly concerned, but indirectly it might be helpful in stimu-lating amalgamations and in the concentration of production on the more efficient mines.We have described in general terms in Section II of this Report the different forms of district marketing * organisations and we do not propose to enter into technical detail. The precise form and conditions of organisation are essentially matters for local determination, as also are the physical boundaries to define the most effective units for district organisa-tions. These boundaries would depend upon economic and geological, as well as geographical, considerations. To some extent they would no doubt be influenced by the areas covered by the district coalowners&apos; associations, but they need not be the same.The chief difficulty of district organisation will lie, we believe, not in these matters, but in getting a sufficient measure of  agreement backed by loyal and active support.
A district organisation is impracticable without the membership of practically all the coalowners in the district; a very few coal-owners could obstruct the desire of a large majority to organise. The success and stability of such an organisation, once it has been set up, depend upon the enduring loyalty of its members; in difficult times the default of a small minority, or their evasion of the agreement they have entered into, would bring about the collapse of the organisation.A numerous membership intensifies these difficulties and is a source of internal weakness and difficulty. The ultimate solution is amalgamation into fewer units, but we have considered whether there are any steps that might be taken by the Government to mitigate the immediate difficulty arising from lack of consolida-tion in the industry. We are not prepared to contemplate any-thing in the nature of general compulsion,* but we think it would be reasonable for Parliament, in cases where it is only the opposition of a small minority that prevents the setting up of a marketing organisation for a particular district, to compel them to come in, provided the circum-stances are such that their rights and interests can be effectively&apos; protected. The safeguards required must of neces-sity be more extensive than those provided for amalgamation and absorption schemes by Part I of the Mining Industry Act, 1926. There are obvious differences between an amalgamation and a marketing agreement between independent concerns, and we are inclined to think that there will be circumstances in which it will prove impossible to make these safeguards really effective.We recommend legislation to adapt and apply Part I of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, so that a minority of, say, 25 per cent, or less, calculated on a tonnage basis, can be compelled to come into a scheme for a district marketing organisation, backed by a 75 per cent, majority, and proved to the satisfaction of a tribunal to be a scheme for the more efficient marketing of coal, consistent with the national interest, and fair and equitable to all its members. In circumstances where the safeguards which can be afforded to the minority are found by the tribunal to be insufficient, and the scheme is disallowed accordingly, the con-structive alternative may be for the parties to consider a scheme for an amalgamation, or a series of amalgamations.The foregoing proposal would, we hope, facilitate the setting up of marketing organisations in some colliery districts. The stability and effectiveness of marketing organizations, after they have been set up, would be strengthened if they could be sure of the support of the law in exercising their functions and en-forcing their agreements. We commend to the attention of the Government the question of revising and clarifying the law on Restraint of Trade so as to remove the present uncertainty as to the status in law of marketing organisations and to define their* Sec Memorandum by Mr Vernon Hartshorn and Mr. F.

The stability and effectiveness of marketing organizations, after they have been set up, would be strengthened if they could be sure of the support of the law in exercising their functions and en-forcing their agreements. We commend to the attention of the Government the question of revising and clarifying the law on Restraint of Trade so as to remove the present uncertainty as to the status in law of marketing organisations and to define their* See Memorandum by Mr Vernon Hartshorn and Mr. F.

legitimate objects. This question is, of course, not confined to the coal-miuing industry and it could hardly be dealt with in con-nexion with that industry only. It seems to us an important and somewhat urgent question in relation&apos; to the organisation of British industry generally. Attention was called to it in the Final Report of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the War (Cd. 9035, pp. 38-40).(c) The Go-ordination of District Organisations.So far, we have only considered the development of district marketing organisations acting independently and competing with each other except in their local markets. In course of time there would be an increasing tendency towards, and need for, working agreements between neighbouring associations which in its final development might be expected to bring about a co-ordinated system of marketing covering the whole or a large part of the country.We consider that from the standpoint of the coal-mining industry such an extension of the effective scope of district marketing organisations would be a desirable, development. But the fact, must be faced that a system of district organisations federated in this way would tend to acquire a monopoly over an article of prime necessity to the economic and social life of the country. As we have already indicated, adequate safeguards against abuse would be imperative, and, even so, a federated marketing organisation of this kind could not be justified unless the industry effected economies, not only in the marketing of coal, but also in all phases of its production and transport. The gains to the industry from a federated organisation could not be justified to the community and could hardly be maintained unless they were derived from economies and increased efficiency, and not from higher prices to the home consumer.The views we have already expressed in regard to the con-solidation of the industry by amalgamations are relevant in this connexion also.(d) The Export Trade.The export trade, whose prosperity is so vital to the industry and the nation, calls for separate consideration since, as we have already recognised, the exporting districts cannot be married in one organisation with the districts whose trade is mainly in the home market.We recognise, also, that the stabilization of prices and output cannot be effectively achieved in the export trade except by forming a marketing organisation in each of the exporting areas and co-ordinating these organisations by a central committee, which at a favourable opportunity would be in a position to negotiate an international agreement. This we regard as the ultimate solution of the problem of organising export marketing, but in the present state of opinion in the exporting districts it is impracticable, and, in any case, probably, could only be reached by gradual stages.
As a first step the setting up of local selling pools by the exporting colliery companies would be practicable and, we are convinced, advantageous; the large selling pools in South York-shire engage substantially in the export trade.We suggest also that benefit would result from a closer co-operation between the colliery owners and the coal exporters such as might be brought about by a joint committee or organisation of the two interests in each of the exporting coalfields.Such an organisation might be able to formulate, and helpits members to carry out, an export policy for the district and it might be able to prevent the unnecessary factoring of export coal and unnecessary speculation, by keeping a register of bona-fide exporters. If this were done on lines satisfactory to the colliery owners of the district, they might be in a position to agree to do export business through such registered exporters alone.Further, such an organisation might use its influence (or even administer rules mutually agreed) to deal with questions of analysis and certification and with improvements in cleaning or changes in grading to meet foreign markets. It might also be possible to use the organisation as a medium for co-ordinating prices of tenders and forward contracts.Some of the suggested functions of the joint export organisa-tion may not be generally practicable, but we venture to hope that, the suggestion that organisations should be set up to effect closer co-ordination between the coalowners and the coal exporters may commend itself to both these parties. Once such organisations were set up and had gauged the extent to which the different exporting districts were competing unneces-sarily, one against the ,other, they would, we believe, be impelled in time to examine the possibilities of coming to a working agreement. The ultimate aim of a national co-ordination of export marketing might then come into sight.
VIII. Summary.1. The development of organised marketing in the coal-mining industry is desirable in order to avoid excessive competition, to effect economies and improvements in the marketing of coal and to help to stabilize the industry.2. The present lack of consolidation in the industry is a serious impediment, and the full development and benefits of organised marketing cannot be realised unless the industry can be con-solidated, by amalgamations, into a much smaller number of units.3. Organised marketing is only immediately practicable in those localities and districts where there is a fairly general desire among the coal owners to develop it.4. The voluntary development of local arrangements more particularly selling pools among neighbouring colliery owners is advocated.5. District organisations, of wider scope than local arrange-ments, are the next stage of development. Where, in any par-ticular district, a fair and equitable scheme for more efficient marketing is supported by a majority of 75 per cent, or more calculated on a tonnage basis, powers should be vested in a tri-bunal to make the scheme compulsory, subject to effective safe-guards for the minority.6. The co-ordination of district associations will be, ultimately, a desirable development, but can only be justified to the com-munity by the industry effecting and sharing with the consumer economies, not only in the marketing of coal, but in all phases of its production and transport.7. The Government is advised to consider the question of revis-ing and clarifying the law on restraint of trade so as to remove the present uncertainty as to the status in law of marketing organisa-tions.8. In the export trade, local selling pools and the possibilities of closer co-operation between colliery owners and exporters should be developed.
We desire to place on record our great appreciation of the services rendered to us by our Secretary, Mr. Edward Fudge, and his assistants, Mr. R.&quot;Larkman and Mr. D. M. M. Morrah. We wish to emphasise that this is no formal expression of opinion, but a genuine expression of our regard for the untiring ability and industry with which they have carried out their duties, thereby very much lessening our labours.FREDERICK W.

VERNON HARTSHORN AND MR, F. B. VARLEY.We have signed the foregoing report, because we are in general agreement with our colleagues that the principle of organised marketing is desirable for the British coal industry. We also agree that it is much to be hoped that the principle will be put into general practice on a voluntary basis.But the opinions furnished to the committee by the district associations of coal owners convince us that the prospect of any general voluntary adoption of organised marketing is very remote ; and many of its advantages to the industry depend on its adoption becoming universal. We think it wrong that the opposition of the mass of the owners should be allowed permanently to deprive the industry and the workmen em-ployed therein of the benefits which we are confident could be obtained by organisation; and we therefore dissent from our colleagues&apos; conclusion that they &quot; are not prepared to con-template anything in the nature of general compulsion &quot;.We recommend that the voluntary principle be given a full trial first, and that any legislation which may be proposed should be devoted primarily to assisting voluntary organisation during a period of, say, two years. But if at the end of that period no substantial progress has been made towards a general and co-ordinated system embracing the whole industry, then we think that the Board of Trade should have power to propose a scheme which, when settled after full investigation and consultation with the industry, should be imposed on all concerned.VERNON HARTSHORN.

APPENDIX.The Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate.From 1869 to 1873 the Ruhr Coalfield enjoyed a period of out-standing prosperity, which was however followed by many years of decline. Supply was outrunning demand ; prices fell; the mine owners competed with one another in the effort to reduce costs of production by increasing output, and the only result was that the fall of price was accentuated. By 1879 the price of coal had fallen from 16 marks per ton to 4, and 70 per cent, of the mines were working at a loss. The fall of price was partially checked in the following years by a series of output and price associations, but none of these proved stable until 1893, when a highly organised kartell was created which has maintained a continuous existence until the present day.From its beginning the kartell wfls a complex and intricate structure. In its corporate capacity it consisted of a syndicate which was a limited liability company having a nominal capital in which each member held shares in proportion to his output; but its members also met as an unincorporated body and entered into contractual relations with the company.The basis of the contract was the setting up of the syndicate as a selling association, standing to the producer in the relation of sole purchaser of his produce, and to the consumer in that of sole seller of Ruhr coal. That is to say, the members contracted to sell their whole output to the syndicate (which was themselves in their corporate capacity) at a price to be fixed by it; the syndicate contracted to take their output and sell it to the dis-tributor or consumer and to hand back the net profits to the members in the form of dividends.But the sjmdicate, being bound to take over the whole output of every member, claimed the right to determine what that out-put should be ; it had therefore to impose upon the members the usual restrictions of an output association. In so doing it pro-ceeded upon the quota system, the quotas being determined on the basis of the output for the period preceding the creation of the kartell, and being in ordinary circumstances constant as to their proportion to the&quot;whole output but variable in absolute amount according to the state of the market and the decision of the kartell&apos;s administration.We shall not give a detailed exposition of the syndicated original machinery-, partly because a description is already easily accessible in Appendix 22 of Volume 3 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry (1925), but mainly because we are more interested in the present working of the organisation, which we shall have occasion to describe at the end of this Appendix.Production. The syndicate was founded at a time when out-put was rapidly increasing, and its object was rather to control and moderate than to stop the increase. Although it was, and remains, nominally bound so far as possible to buy from all
members equally in proportion to their quotas, it did not absolutely preclude excess production, subject to payment of a fine into a fund for the compensation of members who fell short of their quotas. Thus its control of production was not mathematically accurate; in 1895 and 1896 production exceeded the syndicated intention by 2 per cent, and 4J per cent, respectively ; on the other hand in the following years it fell short of requirements. Since the beginning of this century there have been cases of the Syndicate being short of coal to sell, and others of surplus when coal has had to be sold cheaply abroad. In 1924 immense stocks of unsold coal had accumulated but this is mainly to be attributed to quite abnormal financial and economic con-ditions arising out of the War. The production sold by the syndicate in 1925 was about 102,000,000 tons.The control of production must in the nature of things be more effective for the home than for the export market; although at first the syndicate attempted to control both with equal rigour, its history shows a progressive relaxation of the restrictions upon production for export, until at the present day they seem practically to have ceased to operate.Prices. In the markets in which it possesses a monopoly, the syndicate can of course, within limits, fix its own prices, and though trustworthy figures are difficult to obtain, it seems clear that it has always obtained good prices, and has kept them notably stable. Its comparative success in maintaining prices during the depression of 1902 contrasts favourably with the fortunes of other German industries; and although costs of pro-duction also rose, the increase of price in the early years of the syndicate was sufficient to give a rising profit.Competition from outside. The Syndicate was set up in 1893 for a period of ten years and during its first term controlled something over 85 per cent, of the total coal production of the Ruhr. It included none of the mines which belonged to the large Iron and Steel Companies, and these accounted for the greater part of the remainder. To a certain extent, however, even these were in competition with the Syndicate, for they sold their surplus coal in the open market. It was, therefore, thought desirable on the expiration of the Syndicate in 1903 to induce these mines to join, and this was done on certain terms with which we shall deal below. It is stated that this second Syndicate started with the control of 98 per cent, of the total output of the Ruhr. During this second period, outside competition slowly but steadily gathered strength, assisted at times, as we shall see, by the Prussian Government, and by 1912 the output not controlled by the Syndicate amounted to about 8 per cent, of the total. This increased to 11 per cent, in 1913, and competition was apparently so effective that the Syndicate was forced to reduce its prices. To what this competition might have led we are unable to say, for the
War, breaking out before the natural expiration of this Syndicate in 1915, entirely altered the situation. The Syndicate was indeed reconstituted during the War, but, since demand now greatly exceeded supply, the object of its existence was no longer to eliminate competition, but to enable the Government to have an organisation at its command through which it could more effectively control the coal trade.After the War the reconstitution of the Syndicate was made a part of a general scheme of organisation and state control of the industry set up by the German Government. But the owners were allowed to carry out their negotiations on a voluntary basis, with, however, the threat of compulsion if they could not secure a membership controlling 97 per cent, of the total output. This compulsion had in fact to be brought to bear in order to prevent the secession of one great firm which had a quota of 6 million tons and was associated with other firms whose total quotas amounted to about 20 million. The history of this firm shows that its growth to these large proportions had been very largely-due to the Syndicate and suggests that there is a constant danger that kartells may stimulate the growth within their own ranks of large amalgamations and interests which may ultimately become strong enough to stand against them in open competition.The adjustment of the output quotas. The original members were allotted quotas according to their production in the years preceding the establishment of the Syndicate, and new members received quotas on the same lines. Naturally, it was to the interest of every member to take any opportunity of increasing his quota, and all the available means of doing so have been assiduously exploited. Any question of readjustment of the quotas raised very great difficulties owing to the competing interests of the various collieries, and in fact the whole con-stitution of the Syndicate was such as to make variation almost impossible; but there was provision in the original constitution for an increase of 120,000 tons in the quota for each new shaft sunk. This led to the large mines swamping the smaller, and was dropped in 1903, to be revived again, owing to the dearth of coal, in 1922. Moreover, at each renewal of the Syndicate, there was a tendency for reluctant owners to be tempted by the offer of exaggerated quotas to begin or continue membership. As a con-sequence, the total of the nominal quotas now exceeds the pro-ductive capacity by about 40 per cent.The quota was the property of the mine owner and was not directly attached to the mine. Therefore, although the output of a mine might decline, the quota remained and could be sold to the owner of a more efficient mine wishing to increase his production beyond his existing quota. In this way the Syndicate encouraged the painless extinction of uneconomic concerns, and gave a limited outlet for the development of mines of a rising capacity, for the owner of such a mine could buy up in the market the quotas of declining concerns, and add them to his own.
There was one exceptional means of increasing the output quota, which occurred when the demand for coal exceeded the total simply for which the Syndicated quota system allowed. In such circumstances the Syndicate relaxed all restrictions and allowed members to produce freely until the demand was met, after which their quotas were revised according to the actual production during this period; but such occasions were very rare owing to the excess of the nominal quota over the productive capacity which we have mentioned above. Of course, if any colliery owners voluntarily reduced their output and obtained compensation, a developing mine might be able to increase its output and pay a fine into the compensation fund, but this could only be done if the Syndicate should be willing to call upon such members for a greater amount of coal than was laid down for them, and could not normally be made permanent by a revision of the quota.During the later years of the Syndicate, owing to the gradual relaxation of the restrictions upon export, it has become possible for members to sell the whole of their excess coal in the foreign market, but this, of course, is scarcely a substitute for the power to sell at the greater profits obtainable at home.The question of the mixed mines. When the large firms of iron and steel, chemical and other manufacturers owning their own mines, which we shall henceforth call mixed mines, came into the Syndicate in 1903, they created an extremely difficult problem. Naturally, they did not require the services of the Syndicate to sell them their own coal for use in their own works, but they wished to use the Syndicate for the disposal of coal which was surplus to their own requirements or unsuitable in quality for their needs. They, therefore, exacted as part of the terms of their entry the privilege of using as much coal as they liked in their own works without accounting for it to the Syndicate, and of only sharing in the expenses of the Syndicate in proportion to the quantity of coal sold by the Syndicate and not, as did the other members, in proportion to their total output.The pure mines, therefore, found themselves bearing an excessive share of the cost of the Syndicate, and for six years there was continual friction between mixed and pure mines. Eventually in 1909 the mixed mines were given two output quotas-one for their own consumption, and the other for sale, but since they were allowed considerable latitude in shifting coal from one quota to the other, they still retained most of their advantages and the Syndicate most of its embarrassment. In 1912 a further adjustment was proposed in favour of the pure mines, whereby the transfer of coal from the own con-sumption quota to the sale quota was to be stopped, though it might still be transferred in the opposite direction. This would have set a definite limit to the surplus for sale, hitherto a more or less unknown quantity; but nothing came of the proposal.00287 -o
MHowever, at about this time the mixed mines were made liable for the costs of the Syndicate on the basis of their whole output so far as those costs exceeded 3 per cent, of the price of coal actually sold by the Syndicate. Since the expenses of the Syndicate were so high as 9 per cent, of the gross coal sales in 1910, and 12 per cent, in 1911, this new liability was a substantial one.The mixed mines still retained one very considerable advantage which indeed they enjoyed by the very nature of the case, since whether they were members of the Syndicate or not they possessed a secure market. When the proportion of the total quota to be produced for the time being was to be reduced, the reduction applied only to the quota for sale. Therefore, those mines possessing an own consumption quota were very much less affected by such a reduction than those mines whose whole output fell within the quota for sale. Accordingly, the mixed mines could always rely on a steadier output than the pure. In its later years the Syndicate has attempted to reduce this disadvantage of the pure mines by making mines possessing an own consumption quota liable to a greater reduction of their sale quota than the pure mines, but the mixed mines still possess a considerable advantage in this regard.This advantageous position in comparison with their colleagues, which in spite of readjustments has been continuously possessed by the mixed mines, has naturally stimulated the process of integration or the buying up of mines by factories or factories by mines. So much has this been the case that there have been complaints that the best quality coals are no longer to be obtained from the Syndicate, and that the engineering, textile and other industries are forced to take only those qualities of coal which are not suitable for consumption,in associated works.Export Bounties. The Westphalian Syndicate, like the other kartells of Germany, participates in the system of export bounties whereby the producers of raw material allow manu-facturers engaged in competition in the export market to obtain their raw material at preferential prices. The Syndicate, of course, looks to obtain its compensation by the increased demand resulting from the increased share of the export market obtained by the manufacturers. The whole scheme is worked out in elaborate detail and is administered through a clearing house for export bounties at Dusseldorf, which was established in 1902 by the Coal Syndicate and several other Syndicates acting jointly.Distribution. The Syndicate, almost from the first, set out to control the distributing trade. To this end it dealt itself direct with certain classes of large consumers. For the remainder of its output it sold to 29 wholesale firms with whom it entered into strict agreements with a view to preservation of a monopoly. Each wholesaler contracted to respect the Syndicated policy of reserving the large customers to itself,
to confine his sales to a defined area, to refrain from buying from non-syndicated mines, to take equal monthly deliveries and thus bear the burden of seasonal variations of demand, and to accept the Syndicated regulation of his profits and impose similar terms upon his own customers, the retail distributors.One curious anomaly resulted from this system. The whole produce of each mine was sold to the same wholesale merchant, so that in many cases it was impossible for the retailer or consumer to obtain mixed consignments of coal without going to several merchants.At first the wholesalers by themselves combining attempted to preserve their freedom, but were unsuccessful. As early as 1896, those of one district threw in their lot with the Syndicate and formed a coal distributing company. By 1907 nine other such distributing companies had been set up, in all of which the Syndicate held large or predominating financial interests, and all of which were bound by the same monopolistic sales con-u-acts as had been imposed upon their free predecessors.For the export trade the Syndicate set up sales agencies in its principal markets, Belgium, France and Holland, and it held controlling shares in the combination of the shipping firms of the Rhine, called the Kohlenkontor, which under the influence of Hugo Stinnes consolidated the whole of the Rhine traffic. The wholesale distributing companies, though subordinate to the Syndicate, have become extremely powerful, and in some cases are able to impose their will upon the Syndicated policy. In particular, they have done this by associating themselves with the process of integration, either by setting up or buying mines outside the Syndicate (this, since the coal law of 1919, is no longer possible), or by buying coal-consuming works and linking these up with syndicated mines. By this latter method they have become entitled to regard the coal consumed at these works as coal for own consumption, and so to a large extent outside the control of the syndicate.But the process has also worked conversely, for during and since the War the high profits made by the Syndicated dis-tributing companies have tempted many mine owners to acquire controlling interests therein.The Syndicate does not now hold any financial interest in the distributing companies, but controls them through repre-sentatives on the board of each. They operate only in the monopoly markets; in the contested markets the distributing trade is left to independent merchants or to the sale agents of the individual mines.Relations with the Imperial and Prussian Governments.  The Syndicate was originally created solely by private enter-prise, but from the outset it was anxiously watched by the Prussian Government. This Government was itself the owner of a few coal mines outside the Syndicated area, the product of which was mainly used upon the State Railways.   In the last
years of the first Syndicate (1901) the Prussian Diet was apparently alarmed at the progress of the Syndicated monopoly and its rising prices, and voted large sums of money to buy mines in the Ruhr, obviously with the intention of breaking down the monopoly. On its reconstitution in 1903 the Syndicate tried to draw in the Government mines as well as the mixed mines, but owing to complaints about this time of exploitation of the home markets by the Syndicate the Prussian Government refused the invitation and sought to strengthen its power of competition against the Syndicate. The struggle between the Syndicate and the Government came to a head in the attempt of the Government to buy a Company called the Hibernia Company, with an annual output of coal of over 5 million tons. The Syndicate, however, raised capital from its members with the support of five large banks, and itself succeeded in gaining control of the Hibernia Company. Two years later, 1905, it pushed its advantage further by purchasing large areas of proved but undeveloped coalfields so as to prevent possible competitors opening up collieries there.In spite of these successes, the Syndicate still found itself faced with serious competition, the Prussian Government having by 1911 raised its production to about 3J million tons. The competition from outside was combined with severe friction within the Syndicated own ranks, due mainly to the conflcting interests of pure and mixed mines, so that by 1912 there was every prospect of the Syndicated collapse. The Government, which was now the most influential outside producer, seems to have been more alarmed by the prospect of the break-up of the Syndicate and consequent chaos in the market than it had been by the danger of monopoly, and accordingly it at last entered into an agreement to sell through the Syndicate the whole of its surplus coal, obtaining special representation in the Syndicate without becoming a member in the ordinary sense. But a few months afterwards the Syndicate began to, raise the price of household coal. At first the Government acquiesced, but on a second increase taking place within the year in defiance of the Governmentd protest, the Government withdrew from its agreement and once again appeared as an outside competitor. Nevertheless, Government competition seems at no time to have been effective in keeping down prices owing to the cost of production being considerably higher in the State than in the syndicate mines.The outbreak of war, by giving the colliery owners a prac-tically unlimited market, made them indifferent to the con-tinuance of the Syndicate; but the Imperial Government considered it essential that the organisation- should continue and be extended to other coalfields, in order to make its own control of the coal trade possible. It therefore empowered the several State Governments to compel the formation of syndicates-cates,&apos; and under this threat the Westphalian Syndicate was
continued voluntarily, with the Prussian Government once again a member, reserving, however, a power of veto over any decision to increase prices. In 1916 the Government secured its position further by buying the Hibernia Mines from the Syndicate.Under the Coal Law of 1919 the Syndicate finally lost its independence, but it became the model for the organisation of the coal trade throughout Germany. It became one of eleven syndicates covering the whole country, to one of which it was compulsory for every colliery owner to belong. It retained its powers of fixing prices and making agreements with its mem-bers and with outsiders, but the whole of its operations were made subject to the approval of a co-ordinating body for the whole industry of the country, called the National Coal Owners&apos; Association. This Association was governed by a Board of Con-trol on which miners, clerical employees and consumers were all represented. The Association was itself subordinate to a National Coal Board of 60 members, of whom half represented owners and miners in equal proportions, while the other half was made up of representatives of State Governments, owners and employees of gas works, technical mining staffs, clerical mining staffs, coal factors and their employees, owners and workmen in coal-consuming industries, Co-operative Societies, municipal coal consumers, railways, shipping and engineering science. In addition to the National Coal Board and the National Coal Owners&apos; Association, there is a technical com-mittee, whose functions are primarily to advise the National Coal Owners&apos; Association, but which has also power to report direct to the National Coal Board. The whole complex organi-sation is completed by a system of Arbitration Courts, having exclusive jurisdiction over matters connected with the coal in-dustry, which are thus kept out of the ordinary Courts. The entire system is subject to the final control of the Minister for Economic Affairs.Internal Organisation. The original structure of the syndicates-cate, though the same in general plan, has varied considerably in detail during its history, and we proceed to give a brief description of it as it stands in the contract of 30th April, 1925.In return for the services of the Syndicate as the selling agent for their coal, the members enter into a legally enforce-able contract to abide by its decisions and regulations under pain of fines. Every member&apos;s output is restricted by the quota system. He has in every case two, and sometimes three quotas. The first is his quota for own consumption at the mine. The second is his quota for sale through the Syndicate. In the case of mixed mines there is a third quota for own consumption in the associated works. All the quotas are sub-divided into separate quantities for each grade of coal produced.The own consumption quotas are exempt from the control of the Syndicate.   The sale quota has to be sold to the Syndicate
asat the accounting price mentioned below, but the Syndicate does not take the whole of the nominal sale quota. Instead, it fixes from time to time, according to the state of the markets, the percentage of the total quotas which can be taken, and each member is then limited to this percentage of his own in-dividual quota. If he falls below it without giving four weeks&apos; notice of the reduction he is fined in proportion to the deficiency, unless he reduces his output at the Syndicated desire, in which case he is compensated out of a fund subscribed by those mem-bers who, by voluntary agreement with the Syndicate, have exceeded their proportion.Landsales and household fuel for the members&apos; own employees are exempt from control, as also is fuel exchanged with producers of other raw materials for use in the works of the member.These rules as to quotas are made primarily for the home market. For the export market (including certain districts of Germany) there is set aside in advance every six months- an amount equal to that actually exported in the previous six months. It is made up by a deduction from each member&apos;s sale quota in due proportion; and this deduction is made whether the member wishes to engage in the export trade or not. But no member is bound to engage in the export trade unless he wishes, and if he does so there are no fines to enforce adher-ence to his quota. Consequently the export quotas are mainly important through their effect on the calculation of the quotas for sale at home.Three systems of prices exist. There is first the basic price, which is fixed for each quality of coal for long periods, and is taken as a standard not to be varied except at times of general change in market conditions. On this basis is fixed the account-ing price of each class of coal. This is the price at which the Syndicate buys from the members. It then resells in the open market for what price it can obtain. The margin between this and the accounting price, after deducting the expenses of sale, is handed back at the end of the year to the members in pro-portion to their quotas. In the event of the price realised falling below the accounting price, the loss is paid from the general fund of the Syndicate, which is raised by a levy upon the members.The three-price system does not apply to the export market. The Syndicate keeps its members informed of the prices ob-tainable in the export market and elsewhere where competition is to be faced, and if members choose to engage in the export trade, they may sell through the Syndicate as their agent at these prices or may sell independently.The administration is carried out by the ordinary directorate of a limited liability company, assisted by a number of standing committees, and subject to the ultimate control of the general
meeting of the members.

125REPORT(1) The terms of reference to the Committee are to enquire into the &quot; desirability and practicability of developing co-operative selling in the coal-mining industry.&quot;(2) Concrete proposals for co-operative selling may range from mere voluntary agreements between groups of collieries as to prices to comprehensive arrangements for regulating the supply and price of coal throughout the world&apos;s markets.(3) We have surveyed the whole question both in the light of our own experience in the marketing of coal and in that of the evidence available to the Committee from other sources and have come to the conclusion that the system of free and open corn-petition under which the coal trade, in this country reached the commanding position which it occupied in the markets of the world before the war is that which is best suited to its develop-roent in the future. We shall give in detail our reasons for stating that in our opinion those who propose a change from this system have failed to prove that the change would be otherwise than disadvantageous, but before dealing with the subject in detail we think it well to state in broad outline the issues which, in our opinion, are involved and the conclusions at which we have arrived : (1) Stripped of all the extraneous considerations by which the discussion of the matter is frequently confused it is clear that the main objective of co-operative selling arrangements would be to compel the consumer to pay higher prices.(2) Control of output is essential to the realisation of this object.(3) This policy of increase of price by way of limitation of output is diametrically opposed to the real need of the country and of its coal industry to-day ; namely, a high rate of pro-duction at a low cost.(4) The principles underlying the idea of co-operative selling are fundamentally unsound. The point of view in-volved must always be limitation rather than expansion of output, and the tendency must be to sterilise the develop-ment of the coal industry, hamper the expansion of industrial activity, and depress the standard of living all round.(5) The reaction upon, relations between capital and labour must be bad because of the encouragement that would be given to vain attempts to improve the position of the worker in the coal-mining industry by seeking to attain high nominal rates of wages and better nominal conditions through high prices at the expense of regular employment and real earnings.
(4) Although, as has been stated, the main objective must be the securing of higher prices from the consumer, we are aware that the possibility of other advantages is claimed. The principal of these are an increase of colliery prices through a reduction of middlemen&apos;s charges, a stabilising of the general level of coal prices as between periods of good and bad trade, and the abolition of speculation. - These claims are dealt with in the three Appen-dices (A), (B) and (C). It will he seen that in our view very-exaggerated estimates have been made of their significance and that whatever value there is in them is far outweighed by the disadvantages inherent in any system of combined selling arrangements.(5) The appointment of this Committee arose out of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry, 1925. The problem which that Commission had to consider was that at the prices charged for coal, the industry.was being conducted at a loss and was unable to dispose of a substantial portion of its potential output. It is proposed, therefore, to examine in the first place whether an increase in selling prices by concerted arrangement even if practicable would have contributed to the solution of this problem.(6) It is clear that the appropriateness of increased prices as a remedy or partial remedy for this situation involves the assumption that the prices which were being charged were unnecessarily low and that higher prices could be obtained from the buyer without unduly contracting the volume of trade.(7) As regards the first point, it will be seen from the annexed Table I, which reproduces in the form of index numbers the levels of coal prices and of general commodity prices over the five years 1909-13 and during the post-war period, that right up to the stoppage of work on the 1st May, 1926, the post-war level of pit prices of coal remained- above that of general commodity prices.(8) The inference to he drawn from this is that any attempt artificially to raise the general level of coal prices would have defeated its own object by limiting demand.(9) So far as the part of the inland trade of the country sub-ject to foreign competition either in Great Britain or abroad is concerned, it would have had disastrous consequences. The iron and steel industry, for example, which is the largest con-sumer of coal in this country its demand exceeds thirty million tons per annum or one fifth of the entire home demand has been operating under the stress of severe competition with foreign iron and steel produced by the aid of cheaper foreign coal, and in consequence it was forced to sell its products at less than 20 per cent, above 1913 prices. Any ^appreciable increase in the price of coal which immediately before the stop-page was about 63 per cent, above the average price over the five years 1909-13, would have shut down a considerable portion
of the industry, which was already working far below its normal rate of production.(10) It would, no doubt, be possible by a very comprehensive and elaborate organisation to force up the prices of domestic coal and coal used by &quot; sheltered &quot; trades and industries, but these would merely pass on the extra charge to their customers iu an increased price for their goods or services, thus increasing the cost of living all round.(11) We are absolutely opposed to the subsidising of the coal industry and this increase in prices in the &quot; sheltered &quot; home market would be a subsidy in a most insidious form.(12) As regards the coal export and bunker trade, this absorbs over seventy per cent, of the output of some of the larger dis-tricts and one-third of the total output of Great Britain. The export trade has fallen to about two-thirds of its pre-war dimensions and this is not due to a reduction of the consump-tion of coal outside Great Britain but tb the supplanting of British coals by foreign coals in the markets of the world. The following figures will make this clear :  	World consumption of coal outside Great Britain. (a)	Exports of British coal .   (*)	(6) as a percentage of (a). (c)1913    ...... 1925    ......	: 1041-0 1046-3	Vlillion Metric Tons 74-6 49-4	7-2 4-7(13) Our chief competitors in this market are Germany and Poland, but direct comparison between British and German-Polish export prices is unfortunately not possible because of the fact that no data are available of the relative qualities involved. It is, however, significant that notwithstanding the fact that all our exports are subject to severe competition, which is not the case with regard to a considerable portion of the German-Polish exports which pass over land frontiers, the British prices f.o.b. were in April 1926 42-68 per cent, above the 1909/13 figure, whereas the export prices of these two countries were only 33J per cent, above their 1909-13 figure.* If Polish Upper Silesia figures are excluded the increase is 39-4 per cent.We can find no evidence to support the statement made on page 94 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Coal* The values per ton f.o.b. for the period 1909/13 are derived from Royal Commission Appendix, Volume 3, pages 3 and 169.The British figure for April, 1926, is from the Trade and Navigation Returns eliminating shipments to the Irish Free State.The German figure for April, 1926, is from Monatliche Naehweise Tiber den Auswartigen Handel, published by the German Statistical Office.
Industry (1925) that there are foreign markets where the corn-petition is not so much between British and foreign exporters as among the British exporters themselves.In every one of our markets abroad we are in competition witn foreign coals and any attempt to force up prices in the export trade would have been fatal to the retention of even the restricted volume of trade which we still retained before the stoppage whereas it is vitally necessary to the coal industry, the shipping industry and the country at large that every effort should be made to recapture the markets we have lost.(14) We go even further than this. The population of this country has increased by approximately 10 per cent, since 1913 and it is clear that in order to maintain as high a standard of living as in 1913 our exports must be on a larger scale in order to purchase an increased quantity of foodstuffs and raw materials. Bulk outward cargoes of coal which constitute four-fifths in bulk and one-tenth in value of our total exports must continue to form a very important portion of our export trade and any shortage in the export of coal must have a most detrimental effect on our shipping industry, and must increase homeward freights on food-stuffs and raw materials, thus increasing both the cost of living and the cost of production of our manufactures and so further reducing the standard of living in this country and our com-petitive power in the world&apos;s markets.(15) It may be well to point out here that it would be im-possible to establish a system of co-operative selling applicable only to the inland or to the export portion of the coal trade. No district caters exclusively for the export market and although some districts such as South Wales, Northumberland and Fife sell by far the larger proportion of their output for shipment abroad there are other large exporting districts, such as Durham, Yorkshire, Nottingham and Derby which dispose of the greater part of their output in this country. Moreover some of the districts which cater more exclusively for the export market are in a position to divert substantial tonnages for inland consump-tion if a better price is thereby obtainable. Interpenetration of coals from the various districts among the various markets both in this country and abroad takes place to such an extent that it would be impossible to establish water-tight compartments or to set up a scheme for the control of selling arrangements on any basis which did not embrace the whole coal production of the country.(16) It is evident that the proper remedy for the economic problems of the industry, operating as it was at a loss in spite of prices which were above the general level of commodity prices and suffering in consequence from lack of demand both at home and abroad, is a reduction in the costs of production with a view to meeting losses and at the same time stimulating demand ; and that any artificial attempt to increase prices by combined action would merely restrict trade, reduce the volume
of employment and aggravate the problem which it sought to solve.(17) Thus the circumstances of the industry during the past few years far from affording evidence of the desirability of combined selling arrangements suggest that the present is the worst possible time from the point of view of the British coal industry for contemplating proposals which aim at restriction of output and consequently of employment with a view to the securing of higher prices for coal.(18) It still remains necessary, however, to consider the general question of the desirability of such proposals apart from the abnormal circumstances of the British coal industry in the recent past.(19) For this purpose it is necessary to review the position of the British coal industry over a series of years before the war. The facts relevant to the present subject which such a survey reveals are as follow : (1) The output of coal in this country, rose rapidly and continuously up to the outbreak of war at a rate which exceeded the rate of growth of the population. (See Table II and Graph.)(2) The rate of growth of the export trade in coal was even greater than the rate of growth of the output. (See Table II and Graph.)(3) The number of persons to whom the coal industry gave employment increased at a greater rate than did the population.   (See Table II and Graph.)(4) The price of coal was gradually rising relatively to general commodity prices.   (See Table I.)(5) Wages in the coal mining industry before the war were substantially higher than those in any occupation in this country. They were also 18 per cent, higher than wages in the Westphalian coal mines where combined sell-ing arrangements were in operation. (See Tables Ilia and 11Tb.)(6) Profits in the coal mining industry were somewhat lower than those in industry generally.(20) The significance of the facts enumerated under headings (1) and (5) needs no elaboration. They afford no evidence in support of a change in the selling system. As regards (6) how-ever, it has been suggested that a higher rate of profit might have been obtained through higher prices under combined selling arrangements. It has been urged first that this would have placed the industry in a better position for development purposes, and secondly that in any case it is justified on grounds of equity as between industry and industry.The reply to the first of these two points is that the undoubted disparity between the return to capital in the coal industry and that in industry generally did not discourage the expenditure of
4bcapital in the industry. The evidence of the rapid development of the output which has already been quoted bears witness to this. The explanation of the apparent anomaly is doubtless that which was advanced by Sir Josiah Stamp in evidence before the Coal Industry Commission, 1919, viz. : that coal mining is essentially a speculative operation and that the possibility of high returns in individual cases is sufficient to outweigh the discouragement of, and, indeed, itself partly accounts for, a somewhat low actual average return to capital throughout the industry. -As regards the second point, if the matter is looked at as one of abstract justice as between industry and industry, regard must be had not solely to the return to capital but to the combined return to labour and capital. As has already been said, the rate of remuneration to labour in the coal mining industry com-pared very favourably with that prevailing in other occupations, and wages in the coal mining industry formed nearly six-sevenths of the total of wages and profits. So far therefore as considerations of equity are involved, they concern the relation between the remuneration of capital and labour in the coal industry itself, as compared with that in industry generally, and it cannot be assumed that the benefit, if any, of an artificial increase in prices would have gone to increase profits. Apart from these considerations of abstract justice, moreover, it must be borne in mind that prices of coal whether for export or for inland consumption are determined by world conditions, and that increases of price would have tended to restrict the volume of trade, thereby increasing the cost of production and in both ways exercising an adverse effect on profitable working.In face of the facts as to the progress and development of the British coal industry under a system of free and open competi-tion before the war the onus of proving that the position of the industry would be bettered by means of combined selling arrangements is a heavy one. We are of opinion that it can-not be discharged but that on the contrary the results of the adoption of such arrangements -would be most detrimental to the industry.(21) It has already been pointed out in paragraph (3) that even if the object of combined selling arrangements, viz : increase in prices, could have been attained, the effect of any increase in prices would have been, to restrict demand both at home and abroad and to cramp the development of the industry; and further that the possibility of artificially increasing prices would have constituted a standing temptation to labour to press for ever rising levels of wage rates at the expense of volume of employment and actual earnings.(22) We feel, moreover, that just as the aims which it is sought to attain are unsound in principle, so the system of control of production and of sales which it would be necessary to establish would be vicious in its effect.
(-23) The following propositions are, we think, generally accepted by those who favour the adoption of combined selling arrangements and in any event it does not appear difficult to prove them : (1) Output must be systematically controlled on a basis corresponding to the estimated demand for coal. (2) A world basis is necessary.(3) There must be an agreed delimitation of markets.With regard to the first point, experience of purely voluntary arrangements as to price, which it has been sought to establish in this country from time to time, is that they have always broken down in times of depressed trade, partly because of the absence of provisions for penalties in cases of-breach of the arrangements, but partly also because price is only one of the terms and conditions of sale and that it is impossible in practice to standardise and control the other terms and conditions in respect of which concessions may be granted which are equivalent to a concession in price. The importance of regular working in its bearing on costs of production is so great that the strain on mere price arrangements in times of depression must always cause them to break down.(24) Now there are two fundamental objections to the systematic control of output with a view to maintenance of price. In the first place the point of view of limitation of output within the anticipated demand must be detrimental to rapid expansion of trade, which is the point of view under a system of free and open competition aiming always at the creation of new demand This point is of special importance in relation to coal, for having established a certain standard of output over a given period it would be impossible suddenly to increase that output to meet an increase in demand, owing to the time which would be required to effect the necessary development work and the skilled personnel necessary to produce the additional output. Such situations are bound frequently to arise, since the tendency must be continuously to restrict production in order to obtain the highest possible level of price, and the only evidence that that point had been reached  namely a falling off of demand would not be available until it was too late to repair the damage. The second objection to systematic control of output through the allocation of quotas to the various collieries is that it would tend to retard development of the better collieries and increase the average cost of production while artificially maintaining in existence the less economic units which tend to disappear naturally under a competitive system. The only method by which a developing colliery undertaking could increase its output would be by going to the expense of first purchasing one of the less successful undertakings for the purpose of scrapping it and taking advantage of its quota.(25) We have said that a world basis would be necessary for the effective operation of a scheme of co-operative selling. This is evident when it is borne in mind that there is not a single
coal importing country in which competition for the trade does not exist. Moreover, even as regards those coal producing countries, such as the United States of America and Great Britain into which no importation of coal takes place, the prices which are obtained for coal sold for industrial purposes which constitute the bulk of their coal consumption are conditioned by coal.prices in other countries, since these affect the costs of production of competing manufactured articles. There is the further consideration already alluded to in paragraph (15), that in a country like Great Britain, which normally disposes of one-third of its full output for shipment abroad, it would be impracticable to effect a scheme of control applying only to one or the other portion of the trade.(26) A scheme which would embrace Great Britain, the United States of America, Germany, France, Belgium and Poland, would be, to say the least, ambitious, but it would be impossible to leave out of account South Africa, India, Japan, China and other countries with developing outputs whose omission would soon bring about the breakdown of concerted selling arrangements among the others. The body responsible for controlling this gigantic organisation would be in effect responsible for deter-mining the measure of the world&apos;s industrial activity and we do not believe that any body of men could undertake such a stupendous task. It would be utterly impossible to foresee the subtle influences tending towards expansion and contraction of demand and to take effective steps for the necessary adjustment of output. An organisation of this kind would prove altogether too rigid in character and too cumbrous in its operation to meet the necessities of an ever-changing situation and the machinery would soon break down under its own weight.(27) It has been said that delimitation of markets would be a necessary feature of any such scheme, and it may well be doubted whether it will ever be possible to reach agreement among the various competing coal-producing countries on this subject. The point is one of great concern to this country in view of the vital importance of its coal export trade, to which reference has already been made in paragraph (14). In 1925 Great Britain only exported about 50 million tons of coal as against about 75 million tons in 1913, and practically the whole of this loss of trade of 25 million tons per annum is due, not to a reduction in the consumption of coal throughout the world, but to the replacement of British coal by other coals owing to higher costs of production of coal in this country. The ground we have lost in the coal export trade can and will be recovered given a restoration of competitive conditions in this country; but it may be doubted whether competing countries would appreciate the force of this argument in any discussions as to the basis on which a delimitation of markets should take place.(28) A further important point is that participation in an arrangement of this kind would mean revolutionary changes in
the organisation of the British coal export trade involving the abandonment of the system of selling by well-known brands and the loss of valuable personal connections abroad. It would, in fact, mean to all intents and purposes the scrapping of most of the goodwill of the British coal export trade to-day.(29) It seems to us impossible to contemplate that the British coal trade should sacrifice the prospects of gradually increasing its share of the world&apos;s coal trade and take the risk of placing in the melting pot the whole of its export merchanting organisa-tion for the purpose of assisting in the establishment of a system of control of the world&apos;s coal trade which is based on principles fundamentally opposed to those on which the British coal industry has developed and prospered in the past and which would be certain to disintegrate at an early date.Note. Though in our report we have confined our attention to the effect of co-operative selling arrangements on the coal mining industry, we think it well to add that we have not been unmindful of the position of the consumer, from whose point of view a change from a system of free and open competition to one of monopolistic control could not be regarded but with apprehension. It has been shown that to be effective any co-operative selling arrangement would involve unified control over the whole output. It can hardly be supposed that the people of this country would view with equanimity the complete trustification of the coal industry.Attempts to increase prices are only one of the dangers which con-sumers would have to fear. Almost of equal importance vs the loss of freedom which the buyer possesses to-day in selecting the brand of coal which best suits his purpose. In this connection it is interesting to note the complaints which the Committee of the German Gas Association make against the Westphalian Coal Syndicate in their last report. The Com-mittee, alluding to suggestions for the grading of coke, not only according to size, but in respect of moisture and ash content, say that the great obstacle to this is the continued refusal of the coal syndicate to give guarantees of quality of coal while they attempt to classify coal from various pits which they consider of equal value into price groups without regard to gas-making qualities, and claim the option to deliver any one coal of a group instead of the particular brand stipulated by the gas works.We desire to associate ourselves with our colleagues who have signed the Majority Report in expressing our indebtedness to our Secretary, Mr. Edward Fudge, and his Assistants, Mr. B. Larkman and Mr. D. M. M. Morrah, for the services which they have rendered to us daring the Committee&apos;s deliberations.JOHN B. D. BELL. DAVID R. LLEWELLYN. AND. K. McCOSH.0i&apos;2S70
appendix a.Merchants&apos; Charges.Recent inquiries have done something to correct the popular impression that there is a margin of several shillings per ton between the pit price and the price paid by the buyer, which difference goes into the merchants&apos; pocket. The impression is based on the necessarily substantial difference between the pit price and the delivered price of coal for domestic con-sumption. Coal sold for domestic consumption only amounts to one-eighth of the total output, and the wide margin between pit price and delivered price is due to the cost of railway transport, handling and cartage. The increase in this margin between pit price and delivered price over the pre-war figure is mainly accounted for by the increase in wages and the betterment of conditions in the sheltered occupations of railway men and transport and distributive workers and the increase in local taxation. So far as the retail merchants&apos; profits are concerned, these are restricted by competition in the same way as those of other retail traders. As regards the wholesale merchants it is necessary to consider separately the functions of the middlemen in the export and in the inland trade.The first qualification which the exporter must possess is a close acquaintance with the various descriptions of coals in the coalfield or coalfields with which he deals, and an intimate knowledge of their pro-perties and their relative values for various purposes. In the second place, he must have a wide knowledge of conditions in the markets abroad in which he operates and must maintain close and continuous personal touch with them. He must be prepared to finance the trans-actions which he undertakes, since long credits must frequently be given to secure orders, and he is accustomed to make the necessary sea freight arrangements. It is thus a business entirely separate from that of the mining of coal, and requires a separate form of organisation to handle it. Further, as it is a class of business in which initiative, enterprise, prompt decisions and, above all, close personal supervision are of the first importance it will be seen that even if a co-operative colliery selling organisation were established it would still be necessary to leave the business of selling for export in the hands of a firm of specialists who built up the trade to the enormous dimensions it had attained before the outbreak of war. Practical confirmation of this view is to be found in the experience of the Westphalian Syndicate. An organisation of this kind and size is much too cumbrous for the day-to-day, and indeed hour-to-hour, handling of the problems of the export trade, and Herr Janus, the Director of the Westphalian Syndicate, himself made the following statement in evidence before the &quot; Socialisation Commission &quot; :  &quot; I think, therefore, that on the whole the export trade overseas export trade is best done through merchant firms.&quot; (Evidence, page 342.)The evidence which the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry (1925) collected showed that the charges made by exporters to cover their expenses and profits only amounted to a few pence per ton, and it will be seen that whatever may be the merits or demerits of co-operative colliery selling arrangements they could effect no economy in this direction.A suggestion has been made that better results would be obtainable in the export trade if a joint committee of representatives of colliery owners and exporters were established in each exporting district to super-vise the trade, and if the collieries agreed to sell only to exporters who had been approved by the Committee and who were bound to buy and sell in accordance with the Committee&apos;s directions.
In our opinion the adoption of such a proposal would be fatal to the efficient conduct of the trade. To constitute existing firms of exporters a close corporation would be destructive of enterprise; and to subject their operations to the restrictive control of a district committee would render impossible the exercise of initiative and the taking of prompt decisions, which are vital -to success in competing with foreign coals in the export trade market.So far os the inland trade is concerned, the functions of the factor and wholesale merchant have been so well described in the Report of the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry (1925) that there is no need to recapitulate them here. There is this difference between the export and inland coal trades, that while practically the whole of the former is carried on through the medium of merchant firms, in the latter case about half of the tonnage is disposed of directly by collieries to con-sumers. Generally speaking apart from local &quot; land sale &quot; trade-this consists of sales to public utility undertakings, such as railway companies and gasworks and to large industrial consumers, though in many cases even these classes of consumers prefer to avail themselves of the expert knowledge and experience of merchants in buying their coal. The Royal Commission ventured the opinion that while the factor and wholesale merchants fulfil a legitimate and necessary function it is possible that co-operative colliery arrangements for selling purposes might reduce the field in which their services are necessary. It is difficult to understand on what ground it is supposed that the position of the merchant would be materially affected, and it is interesting to note that experience in Germany affords no warrant for this view; indeed, Herr Janus, the Director of the &quot;Westphalian Syndicate, who has already been quoted, pointed out in evidence before the Socialisation Commission (Evidence, page 329) that they had deliberately refrained from attempting to set up bureaux to replace the merchants, as they were convinced that it was necessary to preserve the impulse of merchant firms. What applies to the wholesale merchant, applies with still greater force to the retai. merchant, and Herr Janus pointed out that in Berlin alone there are 140 merchants and 4,000 small stores dealing in briquettes.Bearing in mind that the wholesale merchants&apos; average profit only amounts to about Gd. per ton, according to the particulars ascertained by the Royal Commission, and that spread over the whole of the inland trade it only amounts to about half of this sum, it is clear from the above that, even if it were possible to achieve some saving in these charges, it could only be infinitesimal in amount, and insignificant in relation to the considerations of vital moment involved in a revolutionary departure from the system of unrestricted development of the coal industry under conditions of free and open competition to one of organised manipulation of output with a view to maintenance of prices.60287D
appknbix b.Stabilisation op Prices.Somewhat exaggerated importance is sometimes attached to tho benefits which a stabilising of prices can confer upon the coal industry. It is true that under competitive conditions the price of coal is very sensitive to the state of demand, and that there is, in consequence, a substantial difference between the levels of coal prices in times of good and bad trade. It would be quite erroneous, however, to suppose that it would be of advantage, either to the coal industry or to the consuming industries, if machinery were set up which had the effect of preserving a uniform level of coal prices whatever the state of the trade. There can be no doubt that a measure of flexibility is necessary in order to enable the consuming industries to continue to work in times of depression. Certain industries are encouraged in this way to produce for stock in anticipation of a revival of demand, but, more important still, a reduc-tion in coal prices assists in the reduction of costs of production, which is necessary to stimulate the renewal of demand.While, therefore, it may be conceded that the control of coal prices, assuming it to be practicable, might be to a certain extent advantageous from the point of view of both producer and consumer in reducing the extent of oscillation in coal prices in times of exceptionally bad and exceptionally good trade, it can only do so to a moderate extent without injuring the interests of consumers, and thus the coal industry itself, in bad times, by restricting the consumption of coal, and without unneees-sarily prejudicing the interests of the coal industry in times of active trade conditions when consumers are in a position to pay soniething more than the average level of price.To speak as has been done of turning the coal trade from a gamble into an industry by this means is to ignore the fact that by reason of its dependence on unknown physical conditions the mining of coal must always of necessity be something of a gamble and to ignore also the steadying influences which already exist under the present system. These steadying influences consist first in the practice of making long term contracts for the sale of a large proportion of the output of coal and secondly in the regular intercourse between coal salesmen as to the current position of the market. For these reasons it is urged that this aspect of the question occupies a position quite secondary in importance to that of the main question of the desirability and practicability of endeavouring to establish co-operative selling arrangements with a view to securing on the average a higher price for coal than has obtained under the competitive S5rstem.
APPENDIX C.Speculation.The question of speculation is one that has a bearing on middlemen&apos;s charges and on the stabilisation of prices, and suggestions have been made that the elimination of speculation is an advantage that would (low from combined selling arrangements. We think that this idea, which appears to imply that speculation is necessarily a bad thing, is founded on a misconception.A merchant who undertakes to buy ahead before he has corresponding orders on his books may possibly make large profits if prices rise, but lie also may and often does make severe losses if they fall. Meanwhile it i,s of inestimable advantage to the colliery to have an. outlet thus assured in advance, at a price which the colliery estimates will correspond to that prevailing at the time of delivery. On the other hand a merchant may sell ahead to a customer before he has been able to buy the coal from the colliery, again taking the risk of the market. He is clearly serving a useful purpose to the consumer in relieving him from anxiety on the score of his coal supply and cost.Theoretically, speculative buying and selling might, if permitted with-out. restraint, reduce the whole business of merchant!ng coal to a mere gamble with its attendant financial dangers. In practice these operations are kept within proper bounds by the refusal of collieries to sell to merchants unless they are satisfied as to the soundness of their standing and the character of their business.Within these limits speculation is a necessary feature of the trade and it undoubtedly assists on tho whole in stabilising market conditions.[TaBIsKS.

The second would involve a Bill in Parlienent next session to amend the Mining Industry Act, arid to secure that 75^ of tho coalowners in any district might apply to the Railway and Canal Commission to coerce the other 25); into joining their soiling associa-tion.This will rouse considerable opposition from coal-consuming industries who fear the raising of the price of coal by such associations and also from other
135industries who have similar difficulties in forming selling associations &quot;but r-re not offered legislative help. It will   he derided ao a policy of forcing on coalownors the right to push up coal prices to ?;hich coalowners&apos; representatives on the Committee have expressed their strong objection,      At the sane tine this will be in lino with the Government; rs attitude towards amalgamations -namely making them easisr and cheaper to secure voluntarily, by providing new machinery for the removal of obstructions.The third course would however seen to be the wisest at the moment.     Under this the Government could accept tho principle of tho CommitteeTs report, involving their proposal that if selling associations are in the future deliberately held up by a snail minority of recal-citrant owners, means of coercion should be provided, but could defer putting through the necessary legislation until there is proof that it is necessary.      There is no doubt that many selling associations are being at least discussed now - and it i3 only in the event of their failure fron this specific cause that any legislation will bo required.      Legislation would be much easier to defend when its necossity was apparent, and the fears of the public as to the effect of selling associations night well have becone more modified by that time
13GCOAL MINING INDUSTRY. Report of Committee on Co-operative Soiling.The majority of the Committee come to the conclusion that &quot;the development of organised marketing in the coal mining industry is desirable&quot;.      They contemplate progress in three stages - first &quot;local arrangements - more particularly selling pools - among neighbouring colliery owners&quot;, next &quot;district&quot; organisations, and, lastly, a federation of district organisations.      A summary of their findings appears on p. 28.      This memorandum is concerned only with the single point in which they suggest action by the Government in order to facilitate a process which, they say, &quot;is primarily a matter of commercial negotiation between the individual businesses concerned, which they themselves can best initiate and carry through&quot;.They are not therofore (with the exception of Mr. Hartshorn and Mr. Tarley)  &quot;prepared to contemplate anything in the nature of general compulsion&quot;.     But, recognising that a &quot;district organisation is impracticable without the membership of practically all the coalowners in the district&quot; they &quot;recommend legislation to adapt and apply part I of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, so that a minority of, say, 25)j or less, calculated on a tonnags basis, can be compelled to come into a scheme for a district marketing organisation, backed by a 75^ majority, and. proved to the satisfaction of a tribunal to be a scheme for the more efficient marketing of coal, consistent with the national interest and fair and equitable to all its members&quot;.      They explain that by &quot;district&quot; they mean &quot;the whole of a coalfield or other economically defined selling area&quot; and that by &quot;marketing association&quot; they   mean something that has &quot;a constructive side to its activities  (as, for instance, in organising pools of wagons among its members, and in co-ordinating- Z -
1 d iimprovements in the preparation of ooal for the market) as well as a merely defensive or protective policyr.In referring to Part I of the Mining Industry Act the Committee have in mind, the provision made for what the Act calls &quot;partial absorptions&quot;.     Under this,, colliery companies who have agreed to co-operate in certain of their activities (e.g. pumping water, or generating power, to take the most obvious instances) may make application to tho Railway and Canal Commission to compel othor collieries to come into the scheme, and the Commission have power to apply compulsion if they are satisfied that the inclusion of those collieries in the scheme will promote &quot;the moro economical and officient working, treating or disposal of coal&quot;, is &quot;in the national interest&quot; and is &quot;fair and equitable to all persons affected thereby&quot;.      But selling arrangements are an exception..      It is provided (by an amendment moved by the Government. in Committee) that &quot;no partial absorption scheme shall without the consent of the owner of the absorbed company, provide for the separation of the treating or disposing of coal from the working thereof&quot;.Apart, therefore,- from the difficulty of defining &quot;district&quot;  (which might be great) it would be a simple matter and would need only a&apos; short bill, to amend the Act in the sense suggested.       Jor are many likely to dissent from the view of the majority of the Conraittee that there is much need for improvement in the marketing side of the  coal industry, which &quot;is probably loss organised than any other important industry of tho country against the effects of excessive internal competition in selling and of organised buying by its customers&quot;.      The three colliery dwners who sign the minority report give a good illustration of the type of mind, unfortunately so common in this industry, that is governed by the obsession that since in the fifty years
19 o 00preceding the war tho industry prospered exceedingly, any change from tho methods followed then is hound to he a change for the worse.      They beg the question by assuming that the only results of co-operative selling can ho to &quot;force up prices&quot; successfully to the home consumer and to lose export markets by attempting unsuccessfully to force up prices to the foreign consumer, and then prove their case by showing that these results are undesirable.Even if the development of organised marketing in the coal mining industry is admitted to he desirable, it is not necessarily desirable that the legislature should intervene to promote it.      The proposal that it should do so raises some difficult issues.It is no doubt true that it is almost hopeless to expect any substantial measure of organised marketing in the coal mining industry unloss there is some power to compel minorities.      It is probably also true that, to the formation of district organisation &quot;there is no substantial objection on the ground of monopoly;    thoir operations are kept fairly strictly within bounds by actual or potential competition&quot;. But the formation of distriot organisations, if it ever comes about, is not likely to be the end of the matter.     The Committee themselves regard it as a step in the progress towards larger organisations, perhaps towards a single organisation embracing tho whole, country.     But they recognise too that a monopoly would thus be acquired &quot;over an article of prime necessity to the economic and social life of the country&quot; and that &quot;adequate safeguards against abuse would be imperative&quot;.      It wts not within their reference to make definite suggestions about the form of these safe-guards.      It is a notoriously difficult question, that has been much discussed both here and in other countries, and. no satisfactory solution has been found.     There are obvious
139dangers in the expedient of entrusting the last word on price  (as is done in Germany) to the Governnont, or some other authority outside tho industry.      The joyal Commission on the Coal Industry (p. 70) pictured the position of a tribunal determining the price of coal in the face of tho threat of a strike for higher wages. &quot;The inducement&quot; thoy truly said &quot;to any tribunal to incline against the consumer in order to secure an immediate settlement, even at the risk of economic damage in the future, would be almost irresistible&quot;.     A more hopeful expedient would probably be a limitation of the average profit per ton.To contemplate this, however, is to look a very long way ahead.     Tho Committee would no doubt argue that wo need not concern ourselves at present with anything so remote, but may content ourselves with the early steps towa.rds combination. Here, they would say, tho risk to the consumer does not arise, or, if it does, it could be met by the requirement that the Court must be satisfied tha^t tho organisation is in the national interest,  or, if that is not sufficient, by an adaptation of the practice, already followed by tho Court, when making compulsory order, of giving &quot;liberty to apply&quot; to third parties who may subsequently prove to be detrimentally affected.      In any case they hold the view that &quot;monopolistic combines generally in this country have shown sufficient balance between the selling prices which it is In their power to charge and the selling prices that they do actually charge&quot;;    and that &quot;there is surely no reason to doubt that the same prudonce would be shown by those who had to direct the operations of a coal marketing organisation&quot;.But the reason that prompted the Government to amend the Mining Industry Bill so as to remove these particular compulsory powers from its scope was not apprehension of monopoly selling hut solicitude for the Interests of tho minority coalowners.
X &apos;i UThe argument was that while it was possible to mate provisionfor fair treatment of the absorbed companies when the matter was one of &quot;total&quot; absorption or of partial absorption inrespect of certain stages of production, the case was quite different if it wes proposed to leave a man with his collierybut to deprive him  gainst his will of tho power of sellinghis product as he pleased -      In moving the amendment in committee the Secretary of State for War said&quot;The Government are setting up a Committee for the very purpose of seeing what plans should be adopted for selling syndicates-.    All I want this (the Standing) Committee to do is not to prejudgj that question c c c. Until the Committee, has reported it seems to me to be quite wrong that compulsion should be applied to the formation of selling syndicates unless the undertaking itself is to be taken over&quot;.On this point the lewis Committee were not specific,but contented themselves with saying that they did not suggestcompulsion of unwilling companies unless&quot;the circumstances are such that their rights and interests can be effectively protected.    The safeguards required must of necessity be more extensive than those provided for amalgamation and absorption schemes by Part I of the Mining Industry Act, 1926.    There are obvious differences between an amalgamation and a marketing agreement between independent concerns, and we are inclined to think that there will be circumstances... in which it will prove impossible to make these safeguards really effective .....In circumstances where the safeguards which can be afforded to the minority are found by the tribunal to be insufficient ? and the scheme is disallowed accordingly, the constructive alternative may be for the parties to consider a scheme for an amalgamation,  or a series of amalgamat ions.&quot;It is difficult to see how in this matter, as in&quot;absorptions&quot; for other purposes,  it is possible to give theabsorbed company any more specific protection than that afforded by the requirement that the Railway &amp; Canal Commission mustnot sanotion s scheme unless they are satisfied that it is&quot;in the national Interest and fair and equitable to  allpersons affected thereby&quot;.
141cAgain it must bo remembered th,vt the special legislation proposed for the coal mining industry is at variance with the present attitude of tho law towards trade combinations generally.      Tho inclination of tho Courts is to treat the combination of individual traders into a selling organisation as being against public policy, end they arc reluctant to enforce the contractual penalties which are the sanctions of such combinations.      Tho proposal of the Committee therefore amounts to this; that the Railway &amp; Canal Commission are to be empowered to enforce on reluctant companies &quot;in the national interest&quot; a contract which,  if entered into voluntarily, the ordinary Courts would refuse to enforce on the ground that it was contrary to public policy      It is true that this anomaly arises from the fact that the law in this matter lags behind modern theory and practice, that the Courts already show signs of taking a less rigid view,  and that the Committee themselves &quot;commend to the attention of the Government the question of revising and clori tying the law on Restraint of Trade&quot;.     Ah amendment of the law so far as it relates to the coal industry might perhaps be justified as an instalment, to bo followed by a general amendment of the law, but It would create acurious situation in the meantime.Even apart from this difficulty, can exceptional treatment of the ooal mining industry in this respect be justified?   What so distinguishes coal that the national interest requires the law to assist in the formation of marketing organisations in this industry alone?    The answer would have to be that it so happens that the problem has been specially considered in relation to this industry that the
1 h 5*i % hcorlovncrs pre so backward in their methods the t they need e special spur, that- the prosperity and stability of tho industry&apos; arc- of unique national importance,  arid that tho principle of exceptional legal interference with it? a f f s ire is already recognised, particularly in the direction of forcing c orabinat ion. Why,  in short,  strain rt this gnat when the legislature has swallowed the camel of Part I of tho i fining Industry lot, 1926?Lastly it does not  scorn likely that such legislation as is proposed would find many  frion..s.    If the Mining Industry&apos; Bill hod boon allowed to go through as originally introduced this provision would probably have passe3 with little comment; indeed the Government amendment to  omit It mot with  curiously widespread  opposition from individual members of all parties. But when it is isolate-..: and in the limelight it may be differently regarded-    Che miners&apos; leaders and the minor 1-1.PTs would,  cf course,  support it, though they would  claim that it should  go further..    Ifcny of the more advanced coalowners would also approve of it, though they are not likely to be vocal* Elsewhere the natural tendency w ould be t o look askance at it. The coal owners officially would oppose it hotly.  So would the coal-consuming industries.    It is hardly conceivable that, notwithstanding the attitude of the miners, it could command the support of labour,  and tho popular press would probably form public opinion by calling it the &quot;Dear Coal Bill&quot;.
