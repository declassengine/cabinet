(jffitIS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY Off HIS BHITAHNIO MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERMlgNJP) .-g^E CHS To CP. 26 (27) .Copy Ho.0 A B I N B. T.EOUSS OS&apos; LORDS HBJORrl.Memorrui&amp;um by tho Lord Privy goal.I think there is no doubt that If nothing is done by tho Government this year on Bouse of Lords Reform there will be profound disappointment amongst some of our warmest supporters.     No one who has noted the attitude which successive Conferences of the National Union have taken will doubt this conclusion, and I need not say the feeling has boen greatly intensified by recent industrial difficulties and by the revelation of tho aspirations of the extreme Labour Pfcrty.     There is no doubt therefore that these friends of ours look upon tho Prime Minister&apos;s promise to the deputation last year with a sense of jealous achievement, and though of course ho did not bind tho Government to deal with the subject this year they will be disappointed if it is again ignored.      But I cm not sure that the Cabinet on Wednesday last realised how very little tine we have left in the present Parliament, and if our friends will be disappointed that nothing is done this year they will be wild should nothing be done before the dissolution-tion.      Mow I take it tho Session of 1S28 will be tho last effective Session of tho Parliament and House of lord iteform is not only &amp; very intricate subject but in many respects a very delicate one too, end I feel some confidence that to approach it in the last Session of a Parliament without any previous attempt to crystallise public opinion might end in a fiasco which would greatly- 1      *&quot;n***-J w&apos;       j  /* i...  &apos;***-s-,i v&apos;&quot; * rnw m r i 5-^4S^^mm^&quot;-     I
9 n o &amp; y odiscredit the Govornnent.      But if there is to he a preliminary stage, this coning Session constitutes the only opportunity for it.     Neither when we ooae to look at It will tho process of developing public opinion necessarily take up any Parliamentary time required for other purposes.     The Rouse of lords under present arrangements has nothing to do bafore Easter.     More-over, it is obviously the House In which Second Chamber liefona should be first mooted.     Here then is our opportunity.      A discussion in the House of Lords upon concrete proposals will serve very well to ventilate the urgency of the question and at tho same time its delicacies and yet without finally burning our bridges.     We can put forward our proposals there in the form of resolutions representing the policy we recommend.     We can profess ourselves most willing to consider any modifications of them which may be suggested, particularly as to the personnel of the new House.     And from the reception these discussions obtain we shall bo able to cono to a fijsal conclusion as to the lino upon this quostion that wo ought to take in the Session of 1928.S.January 27th,  1927.
