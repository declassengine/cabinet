THIS IX)Cm!El^-&apos;lffTCT^TRaPER3rr OFlII^BRiaL^^sECifflTj, copy mo.  &quot;\  5CP.34 (27). CABIOI.POOH HEJLXSg TO 3 EH333&apos; bepemkamts. Memorandum, by the Secretary of  State for Scotland,I would again direct the attention of my Colleagues to the situation which has arisen in consequence of the Court of Session having pronounced the poor relief to miners&apos; dependants in Scotland during the late strike to be illegal. (Previous references on the subject are CP. 374(26), Cabinet -62(26) Conclusion 4, and Cabinet 67(26) Conclusion l).It will be remembered that the Cabinet, on 17th December last, authorised me to announce that the Government proposed to legislate at the earliest . opportunity to legalise retrospectively the relief in question.     (It waa also to be clearly understood that the legislation should not apply to future strikes.)     The proposal contained in that announcement has, unfortunately, been received in Scotland with vigorous and widespread opposition which may be said to be gaining strength almost daily.     Numerous protests have been addressed to me by individual Parish Councils, by the Association of Parish Councils, by large ratepayers and by representative Associations and bodies of ratepayers in the industrial belt of Scotland.     I have also received deputations on the subject from the Association of Parish Councils and from representatives of the coal, iron and steel trades.Briefly, the contention put forward is that as the expenditure was incurred (in some cases unwillingly) by Parish Councils under instructions of the Board of Health on an interpretation of the law with which the Councils did not agree and which has since been decided by the Court to be illegal, the Government should now assume financial responsibility for the oonsequences of their error.     It is also contended that if it wae the Government&apos;s desire to assimilate the Scottish position to that of England this objeat has not been achieved inasmuch aa Parish Councils have no power to give relief on loan and that if they had been put in the same position as Boards of Guardians in that respeot the whole of the expenditure would not have been finally chargeable to the rates as it will be in Scotland If the proposed legislation is passed.Another point made is that &quot;nothing should be done by legislation or otherwise to impair the integrity and authority of the law, or undermine public confidence in its administra-tion&quot;.     While this danger was necessarily before the Cabinet when they decided to introduce the indemnifying Bill the prominence that has been given to the matter is such that every possible means will have to be taken to reassure publio opinion.     It will have to be made perfectly clear that whan the Board of Health circular was issued, although there may have been doubts as to the legality of the relief, theGovernment/
Government had no intention of inviting Parish Councils deliberately to break the law.     It was a case not of inciting them to do an Illegal act but mex^ely of ensuring that there should be uniformity of action over the whole country by providing that what could competently be done in one part of the country should also be done in the other part even although not strictly free from legal doubt.     But however that may bo there is a widespread apprehension as to the possibility of creating a dangerous precedent.      It is known to mo that strong pressure has been exercised upon Scottish members to oppose an indemnifying Bill and that the ri3k of their doing so is not confined to members of the Labour Party.The immediate question, therefore, is how the situation is to be met.      I have discussed the position with the Minister of Health and as the result of that discussion there appear to me to be three possible alternatives to the passing of a simple indemnifying Bill whatever the weight of popular opinion may be against it,(1)   The first is to accept the proposition that, having regard to the faot that the Government urged Scottish Parish Councils to adept a course vhioh has subsequently proved to be illegal, the Government should now accept full responsibility therefor and shoulder tho whole burden of the expenditure by means of an Exchequer Grant.      (The amount of expenditure involved is roughly  650,000).     This course would be opon to the obvious criticism that the English taxpayer in general would be called upon to pay his share of the Scottish burden and in addition, as a ratepayer in particular areas, would be paying for the relief to miners&apos; dependants without any assistance from the 3x:ohequor.     It would be difficult to resist the contention that there should be no difference in tho maiuier in which the burden in the two oountries waj to be met. On the other hand if the course suggested were adopted there would be no need for retrospective legislation,(2)   A second alternative would be (a) te recognise that the position of Parish Councils is different from that of Boards Of Guardians both in respect that it was illegal for them to incur the expenditure and also that it would nut be practicable by retrospective legislation to give them the power cf Boards of Guardians, whioh in many cases was exercised, of giving relief on loan and accordingly (b) to meet that difference by giving a Grant towards defraying a portion of the expenditure and leaving the ratepayers to bear the remainder.     Suoh proportions might be on the lines of 75$ and &amp;&amp;% respectively. This woul&amp;, of course, entail legislation to make it lawful for the Parish Councils to impose a rate for their 3haro of the expenditure but a good deal of the sting of the Scottish opposition to the Bill would bo removed by the fact that&apos;so large a proportion was to be defx^ayed by grant.(3)   With regard to the foregoing alternatives it should be noted that while they would meet the past they make no provision with respeot to the future.     It seems impossible that the present anomalous position of the two countries with respect to this form of relief should be allowed to oontinue. It may, therefore, be necessary to provide in the Soottish Bill that the law in Scotland should be made identical with the law in England.     A difficulty of doing this in a purely Scottish Bill is that the English position rests not on any direct/
direct statutory enactment but only on a Court of Appeal decision, the soundness of which, I understand, is not beyond. doubt.     Accordingly, if the policy of granting relief to strikers&apos; dependants is to be a orrtinued&apos;, on the same lineo as hitherto, it may be desirable even in England to baso the power upon express statutory authority.     In that event, the best course might be to introduce legislation forthwith dealing with both England and Scotland which would lay down the law f*BP the future and at the same time legalise retrospectively the relief which lias been paid in Scotland.      Such legislation would not, of course, preclude the possibility of providing for the peculiar position of Scotland by a Grant in aid as set out in the second alternative above.If it is not thought desirable to introduce immediately a Bill dealing with the United Kingdom and if it is decided to proceed as in the second alternative, it seems to me to bo essential that, when the Scottish indemnifying Bill is introduced, an undertaking should be given to the effect that an early opportunity will be taken of passing legitilation assimilating the position In the two countries for the future.As the matter is one of extreme urgency, I trust it may be possible to arrive at a decision with regard to it at an early date.1J0HU GILM0Ua,*Scottish Offico,Whitehall, S.W.I.1st February, 1927.
