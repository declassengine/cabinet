b DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;.lEGRET. ()I Copy No.i. 9 (27).CABINET. COMPANY LAW IN RELATION TO PROFIT-SHARING.MemorandumL by the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet wished to have a short memorandum setting out the present legal powers of oompanies, whether registered under the Companies Acts or statutory companies, to establish profit-sharing schemes.   The attached xviemorandum has accordingly been prepared in the Board of Trade.I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the difficulty of giving statutory Gas Companies a power to issue shares otherwise than for cash and at their market value.P.C-L.14.1.87.Board of Trade.
COMPANY LAW IN RELATION TO PROFIT-SHARING.The position with regard to profit-sharing schemes^ so far aethe adoption of such schemes by oompanies is concerned, may be divided under two heads:-1. The position of companies registered under the Companies Acts.2. The position of statutory companies.1. Companies registered under the Companies Acts.    So far as Companies registered under the Companies Acts are concerned,  there is nothing in these Acts to prevent a Company, whether public or private,  allotting to its employees fully or partly paid shares in the Company,  subject to the provisions of Section 88 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, which require that in the case of shares allotted as fully or partly paid up,  otherwise than in cash,  a contract in writing constituting the title of the allottee to the allotment Bhould be   filed with the Registrar, of Companies.Section 131 of that Act contemplates the holding of shares by employees of private companies; for the limit of membership to 50 persons imposed by that Section as amended by the Companies Act, 1913, is exclusive of persons who are in the employment of the Company or who, having been formerly in the employment of the Company, were, while in such employment, and have continued after the termination of such employment.to be, members of&apos; the Company.With regard to the appointment of employee directors the necessary authority can be obtained by the Company passing a Special Resolution altering its Articles of Association.Sir Francis B. Palmer in the 11th Edition of his booh onCompany Law deals fully with   the question of employees&apos; benefits,and the following extracts taken from that work on pages 1017 and1024 are material&quot;Where companies employ much labour, it is often found expedient to provide for the
employees certain benefits and advantages beyond their ordinary wages,  so that by being interested in the fortunes of the company they may have special inducements to use their best energies and abilities in its services.&quot;Profit-sharing Schemes.(a) &quot;One scheme is for the company to make regulations declaring that a certain portion of its annual profits shall be divided amongst its employees, or selected employees, in propor-tion to their wages, or in some other proportion.(b) Another scheme is to create an issue ofa special class of employees 1 shares, and to allow employees to take them up (and to hold them whilst in the company&apos;s employment).(c) Another scheme is to establish a fund, which is placed in the hands of trustees, who are em-powered to invest the same in shares of the company, to be sold on easy terms to employees, all dividends going in part payment of the purchase-money until, by means thereof, the whole price of the shares has been paid.   Thus an employee, in effect, saves up his share of profits until he obtains with the amount a share in the company.(d) Another scheme sometimes adopted is for the principal shareholders to make over to a trustee a specified number of paid-up shares in the  company, on the footing that certificates, conferring a right to the dividend declared on such shares, shall be Issued to selected employees, such certificates to be retained so long as they remain in the company&apos;s employment.    This scheme possesses many advantages, and this in particular, that whilst giving a share in the profits, it does not render the employees members of the company.&quot;As to the Powers of the Company in regard to &apos;employees    Bene&quot;f its .&quot;In framing, for the benefit of employees, any scheme for establishing funds to which the company is to contribute, it is necessary to consider, besides the Truck Acts, whether such contributions are within the powers of the company, for a company cannot expend the funds on any scheme, however excellent, which is outside the scope of its objects.   Very commonly, the memorandum of association contains express powers to make such contributions, but even without any such express powers a company employing labour4 may do whatever is reasonably necessary to encourage its employees to use their best endeavours on its behalf.&quot;
Ab stated above, the Company could by Special Resolution alter its Articles of Association, and if necessary its Memorandum to provide for any increase in capital, and such alterations might include a provision for the directors to allot employees&apos;  shares of a nominal amount less than the other shares in the company,  (say  1 shares instead of  10 shares) and at the same time provide that such  1 employees&apos; shares should rank for dividend as if they were ordinary Bhares of  10 each.    (See Precedent on page 1027).   Equally the rights of the employee shareholders could be indicated by a special Article showing whether such shares were to be surrendered or not on the termination of employment with the Company.It is no doubt true that under the present law a workman, in order to become a full co-partner in the sense of a part owner of the concern, must be a shareholder.    To put a workman- in the position of a part owner of the concern would seem to Involve giving him three things - (l) a share in the profits;  ( ) representation on the board;  (3) the right to participate in any surplus on the winding up of the company.    (l) and (2)  can quite well be effected under the present law.    (3), the right to participate in a surplus on liquidation, could not be given to a workman, except bycaking him a shareholder or debenture holder, without amendment of the law.    It is not easy to see any valid reason for amending the law in this respect.It appears therefore that, so far as companies registered under the Companies Acts are concerned,  they already have power to give effect to a scheme for the benefit of employees.It will be remembered however that express provision is made by Section 20 of the Mining Industry Act,  1926, that It shall be lawful for any company engaged in the Coal Mining Industry notwithstanding anything in the Memorandum and Articles of Association to establish and carry out a scheme for securing to persons employed by it a share in the profits of the company *
Statutory companies.Co-partnership schemes have been adopted by a large number of Statutory Gas Companies, and in many cases without any express statutory authority.   In the case of statutory companies, however, it is not at present possible for shares to be issued to employees as fully or partly paid up for a consideration other than cash. This arises owing to thefact that the special Acts under which these statutory companies are incoiuporated require new capital to be Issued by auction or tender.It would, no doubt, be possible for a general statutory authority to be given to such companies to issue shares to employees as fully paidj but there is a serious objection to the adoption of that course where a sliding acalo arrangement is in force whereby the rate of charges made to consumers depends upon the rate of dividend paid by the Company on Its share capital, charges   rising as dividends fall and vloe versa. Under such an arrangement it is necessary to avoid any &quot;watering&quot; of capital, because this would at once enable a paper reduction in the rate of dividend to be shown while the real rate remained unaltered.The usual practioe where co-partnership soheraes are Instituted by such companies at present is for the purchase of the shares for employees to be made in the open market by the trustees of a co-partnership fund, or for&quot; the allocation of shares to be made at their full market price, not at their nominal value.The position under the existing law appears to be, therefore, that Companies registered under the Companies Acts have full power today, If they 30 desire, to Institute profit-sharing schemes for the benefit of their employees.
Statutory Companies are governed by their own individual Acts, but so far as the Board of Trade are aware there Is as a rule nothing in these Acts to prevent the Companies from adopting profit-sharing schemes under which the shares are acquired by trustees on behalf of the employees at their full market price.There appears to be no legal obstacle to the transfer of shares from the present holders in companies for the development of profit-sharing schemes.Annexed to this memorandum is a short summary of the New Zealand &quot;Companies Empowering Act, 1984&quot; under which companies are authorised to issue labour shares to persons in their service.4/1/27.
ANNEX.   .Note on the Sew Zealand Companies EmpoweringAct,  1924.The following is a summary of the provisions of the above-named Act under which companies are authorised to Issue labour shares to persons in their services.    The principal provisions of the Act are as follows1. Any company may alter its Memorandum of Association to provide for the issue of such shares.2. The shares shall have no nominal value and shall not form part of the Capital of the Company.3. They shall not be transferable Bave in accordance with the provisions (if any) in that behalf, of the Regulations of the company.4. The shares shall entitle the holders to attend and vote at meetings of shareholders and to share in the profits of the oompany or in its assets in the event of its being wound up to such extent and in such manner as may be determined by the Memorandum or Articles of Association.5. Save as may be expressly provided by the Act or by the company&apos;s Memorandum and Articles of Association,  the holders of labour shares shall have all the privileges of other share-holders.6. A scheme for the issue of labour shares and any alteration of such scheme must be approved by the Court of Arbitration under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1908, and a certificate issued that in the opinion of the Court the scheme would be favourable to the general body of workers,
7.    In the event of complaint being made to that Court that the provisions of the scheme are no longer favourable to the workers, or that the provisions of tho scheme are being violated, or that the scheme is not being fairly administered, or that the scheme is proving detrimental to the business of the company, or that satisfactory reasons exist for revoking the certificate,  the Court has power to revoke the certificate.8.    In the event of such revocation,  all labour shares issued by the company shall be deemed to have been surrendered and the value of those shares shall be payable,  either in cash or in capital shares,  at the option of the company,  to all holdors of labour shares.9. If the holder of any labour share ceases to be employed by the company, he shall be deemed to have surrendered his shares,  and the value of those shares shall be payable to him or his legal personal representatives either in cash or in capital shares.10.    The share in the profits of a Company to which holders of labour shares are entitled may, if authorised by the regulations of the company, be paid by the issue of capital shares.11.    Particulars of labour shares have to be filed annually with the Registrar of Companies.
