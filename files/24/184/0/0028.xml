rgElS DQgQMEtJg XIT Iffiii PHOPKSTY Off HIS BMAHlflO MAJESTYfS GOVERNIvIMg.MBCRAJIDUIvI BY EHE MIHISTE3 OP LABOUR.Copy Ho. LJ  1V1J Some tendencies of grade Union Opinion.mm1. In the early part of lest year I circulated somememoranda on the then existing induf-trial situation; during the subsequent coal dispute and generel strike there was no occasion to review the position generally, hut&apos;it may be of interest now to cell attention to one or two leading features of the present industrir-1 situation, mainly as regards the position of the Trade Unions.     It will be realised that, although some weeks have now elapsed since the termination of the coal dispute, it is still too early to form a reliable opinion as to the way in which the policy of the Tr^de Union movement, or of the various parts of the movement, is likely to take shape..    The outstanding characteristic wf the present situation Is the extent to which cross-currents exist, often of a conflicting character.     It is necessary to remember that amongst many of the members of the Trade Union movement there is still a considerable amount of hostility to the politioal sido of the movement, and it must not be assumed that when the leaders of that side make speeches shout the need for joint national conferences they are voicing the opinion of those who matter in the Trade Union world. j4n illustration of this occurred the other day. Mr.Henderson made a speech in which he pleaded for a national industrial conference, a speech which obtained wide publicity.     It was followed within 48 hours by a statement by Mr.Bcvin, in the course of which he said
9 o n /jo that it was a pity that individual members of the party should make speeches upon matters of policy which had not yet been considered by the Trade Union movement as a whole, and that in any case, so far as he was concerned,  he had no use for a national industrial conference;    his policy hrd been, and still was, to obtain for his members in their various trades the best agreements possible as a result of negotiation trade by trade.E. The proposal that there should be an Industrial conference has been made from time to time in recent years, and is being revived now in many quarters - mainly, as I say, political. Some of those who are now backing the proposal know very well why it vras dropped, notwithstanding the momentum that it was given in 1919.      The history of the 1919 Industrial Conference, and of the events that led to the abandonment of the proposal to have a National Industrial Council,  is important and I am circulating a separate note about it.     I very much doubt whether the demand for such a body is likely to come with any force from the trade unionists; but it will very likely be put forward by the political side, for reasons which it is not difficult to appreciate.      It may very likely suit the purpose of the political side to press for some declaration by the Government for &quot;or against a National Industrial Council.     The idea is sufficiently attractive to secure a considerable measure of support in neutral quarters, and great ca.ro will be necessary in deciding what attitude the Government should adopt towards it.3. In the meantime some of the other cross currents in thoTr^de Union world, should be noted, as their influence is very considerable in creating the present state of feelings The first and most important is the marked division of opinion between the Bight pni Left wings of the movement as typified by the division in the T*U.G. itself.      There is no need to
enlarge on this point, as its importance is so widely known and recognised.     A complication is introduced &quot;by the division existing between tho miners on tho one hand and large seotions of the rest of tho trado union movement on tho other.     This division corresponds to a considerable extent with that between the Sight and Loft wings of the movement, but does not coincide with it by any manner of means.The second principal cause of uncertainty is the jealousy between one leader and another.      This is as marked rs the division between the Right and Left wings of the movement, and needs no further comment here.Internally, too, there Is a certain amount of hard-thinking going on amongst the rank and file of the Unions which may have healthy results.    Dr.Shadwell&quot;s recent articles in the Times have celled attention to this movement.      There arc Indications that the rank and file are taking a more active and intelligent interest in the work of the Unions,and pit ho ugh. the &quot;minority movement&quot; is still very etrontr efforts pre being made In rome quarters,  e. g.the Yorkshire Miners&quot; Association, to combat communism.    I am not sure, however, that these tendencies are so strong as Dr.Shsdwell suggests;    the examples that he gives e.g. Have look Wilson1 s activities and the formation of tho Spencer Union in Nottingham, are few and are not very conclusive evidsncFor the above among other reasons it may be found very difficult for the T.U.0A to determine upon any settled policy for some considerable time,     Tho Leader of the Opposition has just said that he would like to see the T.U.C. sit down with their opposite number amongst tho employers  (i,e. tho Employers&apos; Confederation) to draw up a &quot;catalogue&quot; of the causes of industrial unrest and te see how far those causoe can be removed.     There is nothing to indicate that the T.U.C. were
0 ^ 1(j d t)oonsultod before this suggestion was m^dc. Before tho T.U.C. oould go to suoh a meeting it would hare to decide a number of questions that are very much at issue amongst its members. Ono only need &quot;be mentioned - is the T.U.C., to go on with the ^nti-capit^list campaign rnd the derarnd for the abolition of capitalism, or is it to agree to accept the existing system (without prejudice to the ultimate future) ?-.n&amp; to see what is the best arr-mgeraent that can be made for tho immedirte future, by oo-operotion between^on the two sides, for the enhancement of the prosperity of British industry?    hose rre questions very much in the minds of the T*U.C. leaders, but tho rnswers have yet to be formulated.      iorae of the leaders realise that thore is an inconsistency in celling into a conference for industrial per?oe representatives of a. system which they ere themselves committed, either directly or indirectly by reason of their association with tho politioal side of the Labour movement, to try to abolish.     ?urthexmioro, a large number of the leading Trade Union officials hrve very difficult domestic problems to solve.      They are, for the most, port, busy with the task of rebuilding their respective Unions, from the point of view of both membership and finance.      Indeed these two ranters ,eo dominate the situation thtft for some timo to come the minds of very many of tho leaders pre likely to be pre-oocupied with thorn to a degree&apos; which will make them reluotrmt to devote much time to tho discussion of broader questions of policy.A natural explmation is also thus afforded of individual occurrences of the past few weeks.     A very privrto effort wrs msde to follow up the speech which Lord tyeir made in the House of Lords ?t the end of the session (suggesting an informal round-table mooting about industrial matters) by a talk between Lord ;7eir and four trade unionists (MraBevin snd Mr.FJpylor, who have just been on the Government Delegation to -America;   Mr.Hicks, the Ohairmfui of the T.U.C., and Mr.Pugh,
the ex-Chairman of the T.U.G.).      It hps come to nothing for the time being, because the two that mattered most in this group (Mr.Bevin and Mr.Pugh) felt that the trade union situation is so Uncertain, and is being so oomplioated by declarations on questions of industrial policy made by representative people on the Labour side, that it is necessrry that there should be a good deal more discussion and agreement upon polioy before any attempt is made to t^lk to those who might be ?ble to influence the other side.Another illustration of tho sensitive state of mind ef the Trade Union leaders at the present time is to bo seen in an incident which oocuxrod a fortnight or so ago when it was reported in the Sunday press that there had recently been a &quot;secret&quot; meeting at which the Chanoellor of the Exchequer wo,s present with the T.U.G, chiefs.    I understand that those who were thought to be the &quot;T.U*C. chiefs&quot; oonoerned wore kept busy during the Sunday answering telepho-nio enquiries from other trede unionists to know what they meant by going to secret meetings with representatives of the Government ^nd what busiuess they had to disouss Trade Union polioy before that polioy had been considered by the T*U*C* as a whole, or by the movement as o whole.     Again, just before Christmas six of the T.U.C. (including Mr.Hicks) came to see me to press once more for the&quot;&apos;&quot; ratification of the Washington Hours Convention.    When I had explained to them the enhanced opposition of the employers, Mr,Hicks (avowedly on his own initiative) suggested that there might be a meeting between the T.U.C. and the employers to thrash out the&apos; difficulties.      This suggestion was a suggestion by Mr.Hicks in his capacity of Trade Union leader accustomed to industrial negotiation and bargaining, not by Mr,Kicks in the rolo of Chairman of the T.U.C. and    (by reason of that Chairmanship) a labour &quot;politician&quot;.    At once other memberB of the deputation5.
intervened and murmured something about such a conference raising ^questions of principle&quot; which had not been discussed by their colleagues.      And I have since learnt privately that Mr. Hicks was afterwards severely attacked on the T.U.C, for having put forward a suggestion that that body should discuss with the employers a matter which,  in the view of the attackers , Is a matter not between the Unions and the Employers but between the Labour movement and the Government. This is an instance to/show how inextricably the T.U.G, is mixed up with the political labour party and how difficult the T.U.C, find it to be to decide upon an industrial policy.Similar considerations have affected the attitude of the trade unionists towards the proposal for an industrial truce.     Such proposals have been put forward from time to time;    they have almost invariably been followed by declara-tions on the part of the leaders of one or other of the big trade unions that talk of a truce at the present time is sheer folly.     The motive for this attitude is probably twofold.   Firstly, the dislike of leaders, as explained above, for anything that may look like a general commitment on principle in advance, and secondly, objections which it is felt can be urged against the proposal In itself.     The argument can always be advanced that an Industrial truce, dating from now, would be a move favourable to the employers, for wages are at a low level and the truce would handicap the unions in their efforts to take full advantage of the upward movement of trade to secure wage Improvements.      In the Engineering, Shipbuilding, and Iron and Steel Trades, where the trade depression has led to low levels of wages, especially for the skilled men, there are bound to be
demands for advances of wages so soon as it Is clear that improved trade has set in;    and although there is reason&apos; to hope that both employers and employed in those trades will be able to find a way of adjusting wages without a stoppage of work, the leaders of the Unions concerned would not wish their bargaining power to be fettered by the knowledge that they had beforehand become committed to a &quot;truce&quot; . 9. It is clear therefore that there are great difficultiesin the way of any definite &quot;concordat&quot; between capital and labour at the moment.      It may indeed come sbout, but good relations and the spirit of co-operation are more likely - if employers act wisely - to be established in the factories and workshops in different industries and so re-act on the Trade Union movement at headquarters, than to be spread from the centre outwards and downwards.      In other words, any 11 concordat&quot; is more likely to be the oxitcome of a gradual growth than of any readymade Industrial &quot;Locarno&quot;.     While there is great hesitancy - for the reasons given - at any commitment on general principles or lines of action, yet on the part of the large majority of Trade Union leaders there is a desire in the case of each Individual for     &quot;  prosperity in the particular industry with which he is concerned.     It is too early -to generalise, and perhaps there are not data sufficient for the purpose, but in a number of Industries, it would appear that work is going forward with a degree of willingness and a desire to co-operate that may produce healthy results, and it is likely that Trade Union leaders, speaking generally, are glad to see this occur and will not do anything to interfere with it unless they detect
9/3 1 l* &apos;&amp; 0or think they can detect in any individual case some ulterior motive or hidden attack on the trade union position.10. under these circumstances, whether or not themovement towards a saner trade unionism is destined to expand, I am convinced that the present situation affords a unique opportunity to employers individually to play an Important part in encouraging it.     The problem before them (and it is the main lesson to be learned from American experience) Is to secure, In consultation with their workpeople, such changes in methods or processes as will ensure the maximum of eoonomic production, whilst at the same time avoiding anything that would invite a conflict with the unions .      Let it be accepted that Trade Unionism exists and can play a useful part by collective bargaining to settle the broad general rules for each trade - minimum rates of wages, weekly hours, &amp;c,, but within the four corners established by such collective agreements let there be more freedom to the individual employer to adjust with his own men the way&quot; &apos; in which they can best make their own business pay its way.      Industrial co-operation and peace might become real if the rank and file employers were prepared to take their workpeople Into confidence regarding the facts of industry, and to pursue a policy of real co-operation in the shops with the blessing, limited guidance, and easy control of the employers&apos;  and workmen&apos;s organisations.      I am not sure that employers are fully alive to the opportunity which is presented to them by the present condition of the Trade Union movement, with its great possibilities for good or
for ill, aooording to the way in which the position is handled.llo In considering the prohehle effects, politically8.nd industrially, of the cross currents which -  undoubtedly are disturbing the Trade Union move-ment at the present time, it must be borne in mind that the events of the last year have brought into great prominence two features of the situation which (quite apart from what may be thought to be the intentions of the Government regarding Trade Union legislstion ) may very well be sufficient to outweigh all the minor differences and divergences of view that go to make   up those cross-currents,, These two things are:-(1)    the extraordinary degree to which thelatent loyalty of workmen to one another was demonstrated by the cessation of work which took place at the time of the general strike;( )    the failure of the Government  (notthis Government only, but each Government since 1920,  other than the Labour Government of 1924 ) to ratify the
Washington Hours Convention - a failure which, in the minds of many trade union leaders , Is immensely aggravated by the passing of the Coal Mines Eight Hours Act. It is a common mistake to assume that the divergences of. opinion known to exist In the Trade Union movement are so strong that there will not be unanimity of action if a struggle should ensue.    Experience shows how quickly what were thought to be serious differences disappear when once a call to action has been sounded.     While, therefore, encouragement - and a reasonable hope of a period of freedom from overt Industrial disturbance -may be derived from the present pre*-occupation of the Trade Union world with difficulties and differences of its own, it should not be forgotten that every opportunity to find a common rallying ground will be seized upon by the T.U.C. and by the leaders of the labour movement generally;   they see such a possible rallying ground in the dislike of the Government which is felt at the moment by large numbers of trade unionists as a result of the events of last year, and in this respect they will doubtless receive the whole-hearted support of the political side of the movement.A.S-M.Ministry of Labour, 28th January, 1927.
