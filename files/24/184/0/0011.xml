(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT. )SECRET . COPY NO:      (JCABINET-CPill  (27)*CONSTITUTION OP A ROYAL PINE ART COMMISSION v. - FOR SCOTLAND.Memorandum by tlae Secretary of State for Scotland.1.     As my colleagues are aware, a Royal Pine Art Commission for England -ebaflgjaefcefe has been in existence since 1924, its functions being to report on such questions of public amenity or artistic importance as say be referred to it by Government Departments, ana also, if it considers it advantageous, to give advice on similar questions, when asked to do so by public or quasi-public bodies.     It has given advice on a number of proposals such as those in the list appended hereto, and has done valuable work.2.      The appointment of a Commission for England and TOcfLea naturally led to a demand that similar work should be undertaken in Scotland.      In order.to ascertain as accurately as possible the state of public opinion in Scotland on the subject, I have convened conferences of representatives of local authorities and of artistic &quot;bodies respectively and I find that there is a general feeling that it is most desirable that there should be some body to which artistic questions of public importance in Scotland could be referred.3.     As regards the best method of extending this work to Scotland, it is necessary to rule out the idea of a   joint Commission which some were disposed to favour.     The experience of the English Commission shows that, owing inter alia to the necessity for visiting the sites&apos; proposed for monuments, etc., the work would be more than the Commissioners could undertake if the field of their activities were extended to include Scotland.     Moreover, an arrangement of that nature would probably involve unduly heavy expenses in travelling.      There remains, as an alternative, the appointment of a separate Commission for Scotland, and this, I am sure, would meet with general acceptance. It was unanimously recommended by the representatives of artistic bodies at the more recent of the Conferences mentioned.      It has been suggested that the Scottish Commission should include one or two members of the English Commission.      This may prove impracticable, and there is no reason to suppose that in the absence of a liaison of that nature the two Commissions would not keep in effective contact with each other.      The English Commission at present consists of two laymen and seven professional members, all unpaid.      It is proposed that the Scottish Commission should be constituted on a similar basis, but possibly with a smaller membership.4.      I am fully convinced that it is desirable that there should be [ similar facilities in Scotland to those which exist in England. ,tunl Talou f for utilizing the services of a body like the Royal Pine Art Commission, and it seems clear that the appointment of a separate Scottish Commission is the best, if not the only practicable method, of effecting that end.      I shall be glad aocordinglv to have authority to submit the proposal for the appointment of a Royal Pine Art Commission for Scotland to His Majesty for approval.5.     I may add that tiie cost of the English Commission from its appointment in May, 1924, until the date of its second Report in July, 1926, was  only  1,759.      It is reasonable to expect that the cost of a Scottish Commission will be considerably less, and in that expectation the Treasury have no objection to the proposal.Scottish Office.20th.
