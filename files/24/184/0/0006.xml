CHINA.   PIRACY IN BIAS BAY.(OLD. Papers Nos. 283-C and 285-C.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee on proposals from the Governor of Hong Kong for dealing with piracy in Bias Bay (C.I.D. Paper No. 283-C)* and a Note by the Secretary (OLD. Paper No. 285-C) t containing the Conclusions of a Cabinet Meeting held on the 17th November, 1926.THE PRIME MINISTER asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies for his opinion as to the effect of the recent successful Naval action in connection with the piracy of the steamship &quot; Sunning &quot; on the general situation as regards piracy in Bias Bay.Mr. AMERY replied that this action was all to the good, and in his opinion should certainly strengthen our hand in approaching the Canton Government, and demanding that the latter should take immediate steps for the suppression of piracy under threat of action by His Majesty&apos;s Government as suggested *by the Oversea Defence Committee. He suggested that we should now be justified in saying that if another case of piracy occurred we would, if necessary, land and deal&quot; with the pirates ourselves. He read a telegram just received from the Governor of Hong Kong urging that action should be taken at once vis-a-vis Canton, and that the preparation of a specific military and naval plan should be agreed to. He considered that we had now a most favourable opportunity for approaching Canton with a view to seeing what action the latter would take.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that the essence of the action recommended by the Oversea Defence Committee was contained in a telegram (OLD. Paper No. 283-C, Appendix 6) which it was suggested should be sent by the Foreign Office to the British Minister, Pekin. He had no objection to the despatch of this telegram. In his opinion the Naval Commander-in-Chief had handled the recent case of the steamship &quot; Sunning &quot; with great skill, and he hoped that the results of this successful action would ease the situation as regards piracy. He pointed out that the Governor of Hong Kong had always shown a bias in favour of landing on Chinese soil and burning the pirate villages. He himself was favourable to any action taken at sea, but was definitely opposed to any landing in China, unless the Chiefs of Staff were quite satisfied that the plan is feasible with the resources at present available, and that there was no risk of its developing into larger operations.Mr. BRIDGEMAN suggested that before a decision could be made regarding the plan submitted by the Governor of Hong Kong a clearer explanation was required as to exactly what it would involve. The pirates evidently made a practice of boarding the ship as peaceful passengers at Canton, Hong Kong or* Already circulated as CP. 372 (26). [15428-3] [15644-2Jt Cabinet 58 (26), Conclusion 5.
elsewhere, though they were sometimes joined later by other pirates in junks, and it was the former that constituted the main danger. He wondered if it would be possible in any way to deal with these pirates as they embarked. In any case, he agreed with the Admiralty view expressedin C.I.D. Paper No. 283-C, that patrolling by naval craft was unlikely to be effective.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN proposed that the Naval Commander-in-chief and the General-Officer-Commanding at Hong Kong should be requested to send home a full Report in order that there might be an opportunity of judging the real nature of the operation contemplated. The Chiefs of Staff might then consider this Report and advise the Committee of Imperial Defence accordingly. He considered that it would be unwise to make a decision before this further information was available.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS, pointing out that there was a considerable amount of information in the Governor&apos;s despatch and the other appendices to C.I.D. Paper No. 283-C, suggested that the question might bo referred at once to the Chiefs of Staff, and that only if the latter considered it necessary the Admiral and General-Officer-Commanding Hong Kong should bo asked for a further Report.Mr. AMERY stated that he hoped some action would really be taken with regard to the piracy question, and he asked whether authority could be given for Canton to be warned. The warning, he considered, should be issued immediately and should not wait for the next outrage.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS suggested that Canton should not be approached until a plan of British action had been prepared.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend (a.) That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should examine the plan for dealing with piracy in Bias Bay suggested by the Governor of Hong Kong in Appendix I to C.I.D. Paper No. 283-C, obtaining from Hong Kong any further information which may be necessary for this purpose, and should advise the Committee of Imperial Defence as to what action they recommend.(b.) That in the meantime the suggested telegram to the British Minister at Peking (C.I.D. Paper No. 283-C, Appendix VI) should not be sent.At-1 M. M.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   December 1926.SECRET.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 21$th Meeting, held on December 16, 1926.(2.) CHINA :  PIRACY IN BIAS BAY. (OLD. Paper No. 287-C,) (Previous Reference : OLD. Minutes of 218th Meeting, Minute 3.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff (OLD. Paper No. 287-C), to whom the plan for dealing with piracy in Bias Bay had been referred by the Committee at their 218th Meeting.In reply to the Prime Minister, SIR FREDERICK FIELD stated that Lord Beatty had nothing further to add to the Report.SIR GEORGE MILNE said that the Chiefs of Staff were in favour of deferring execution of the plan submitted by the Governor of Hong Kong until after another piracy had taken place, as indicated in paragraph 6 of their Report.In reply to the Prime Minister, SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that, lie was of the opinion that the correct course would be to ask the Canton Government to co-operate, but he would like to consult the Consul-General, Canton, before making a definite decision in regard to this suggestion. Later in the meeting he added that he did not wish that instructions to the local authorities at Hong Kong should be delayed until after he had received a reply from Canton.After some discussion, The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend (a.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, without delay, consult the Consul-General, Canton, with a view to obtaining, if possible, the co-operation of the Canton Government in the proposed operation under threat of independent action on our part in the event of their refusal.(&amp;.) That the Governor of Hong Kong should at once be informed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Consul-General, Canton, is being consulted as above, and that he should be authorised in conjunction with the Naval and Military authorities to carry out the plan submitted by him without further delay in the event of another piracy, subject to the proviso that smoke-bombing of the villages is forbidden.(c.) That the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War should send corresponding instructions to the Naval Comma nder-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding, Hong Kong, respectively.(d.) That the Secretary should circulate the proceedings of the Committee of Imperial Defence on this subject to the Cabinet for their information.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

1*1 .f*Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence    December 192G.SECRET. 287-C.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 57.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.CHINA:  PIRACY IN BIAS BAY. (Previous C.L.D. Papers Nos. 283-C and 285-C.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff.AT their 218th Meeting on the 25th November, 1926, the Committee of Imperial Defence recommended &quot; That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should examine the plan for dealing with piracy in Bias Bay suggested by the Governor of Hong Kong in Appendix I to OLD. Paper No. 283-C, obtaining from Hong Kong any further information which may be necessary for this purpose, and should advise the&apos; Committee of Imperial Defence as to what action they recommend.&quot;2. In accordance with this recommendation we met, to consider this question, on the 2nd December, J926, having in the meantime obtained by telegram from Hong Kong further information regarding the proposed plan.3. In a telegram, dated the-1st December, 1926 (Appendix), the General Officer Commanding, Hong Kong, recommends with the approval of the Governor and the Consul-General, Canton, that action should now be taken against the Bias Bay pirates &quot;at our own select time without awaiting further piracy.&quot; We note that this suggestion involves an important alteration to the procedure originally recommended by the Governor of Hong Kong, who proposed that the expedition should be immediately despatched when next a piracy in Bias Bay is reported.4. From other telegrams received since the 218th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, we have ascertained that the headquarters of the Bias Bay pirates is definitely established to be at Fan-Lo-Kong village, that some thirty or forty of the pirates are known to the Hong Kong police by name, and that Chinese guides can be provided to identify individuals and their places of residence.We are also informed that the proposed operation will consist of a landing as close as possible to Ean-Lo-Kong, and that transportation to this place and provision of shallow-draught boats for actual landing have been arranged by the Royal Navy. The intention is to land before dawn, at which hour Fau-Lo-Kong will be smoke-bombed by seaplanes. This action, combined with news of the landing, is expected to cause a general evacuation of the village. Half an hour after dawn the village will be approached from the shore side and entered ; the entrances to the village will be picketed from the land side and houses belonging to known pirates will be destroyed after ensuring that the civil population has evacuated them. If any pirates are captured it is proposed to hand them over, if possible, to the local Chinese authorities. No further offensive action is intended unless troops are attacked. In the unlikely event of the landing being opposed, covering fire would be provided by ships&apos; guns and machine guns. The number of troops to be employed is 10 officers and 256 other ranks, and the operation would be completed within twenty-four hours.[15491] [15644-4]
5. From the above information it will be seen that the proposed operation is a very minor one, definitely limited in scope and devised to avoid the development of larger operations, but which depends on matters of local detail on which, at so great a distance, we are necessarily incompletely informed.6. Whether the expedition should, as is now suggested, be authorised as a deliberate act of punition, or should be permitted only after another piracy takes place, is a matter of policy on wdiich it is not for us to advise, but from a military point of view we favour the latter alternative.7. It would appear that if the operation is to take place only after the next piracy and the present proposal to land before dawn is adhered to, valuable time may be lost. We feel, however, that all such details must be left to the responsible Naval and Military authorities on the spot to settle according to circumstances, and that our approval can necessarily be only of a very generaL character.8. There is, nevertheless, one suggestion to which we take exception, namely, that the village of Fan-Lo-Kong should be smoke-bombed, when the landing takes place. Such action would in our opinion not only give the pirates unnecessary warning of our intention, but. might be misrepresented as the use of gas throughout China and result in our incurring a good deal of odium.9. Finally, we would suggest that the Consul-General at Canton shotild be instructed without delay to obtain the co-operation of the Canton Government, even if such co-operation is limited to the presence of one Chinese official at the scene of action.10. To sum up, we submit the following recommendations for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence  (i.) That approval  in  principle should be given to the proposed  operationdescribed in paragraph 4 above, with the proviso that the smoke-bombing of the villages be forbidden, (ii.) That the Canton Government should be asked without delay to co-operate under threat of independent action on our part in the event of their refusal.The question of whether the expedition should he authorised as an act of punition or should only be permitted after another act of piracy involves political consideration on which it is not for us to advise.(Signed) BEATTY.G.
