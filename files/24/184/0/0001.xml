,it)CUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.;ET..CABINET.RED SEA LIGHTS.COPY NO. SOMEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.There are three lighthouses at the southern end of the Red Sea erected by the Turkish Government and maintained by that Government until October, 1914, at their own expense.    From October 1914 till 1916 the lighthouses were maintained by the Government of India and since then by the Treasury at a cost of about  10,000 a year.    The Board of Trade has been the Department responsible for seeing that this money was properly expended.    The Treasury have now given notice that these lights will not be maintained by the British Exchequer after the end of the present financial year,  and have requested the Board of Trade to take the necessary steps for having the lights discontinued.    The objection of the Treasury to continue paying for these lights indefinitely is very reasonable.    There is no reason in the nature of things why these lighthouses should be maintained by the British Exohequer; but the consequence of extinguishing them will be so serious that I do not think orders to put the lights out should be issued without express Cabinet authority.The responsibility for maintaining the lights fell on the British Government when the islands on which the lighthouses are placed were taken over during the first year of the war, but the lights are of benefit to all the ships whioh pass up and down the Red Sea and ought to be maintained by dues levied from passing ships.      There never has been any system for levying dues in respect of these lighthouses,  and it has been extraordinarily difficult to construct such a system.    The work has been rendered more
difficult by the attitude of the French company who built and managed the lighthouses on behalf of the Turkish Government, as they wished either to be reinstated or to be paid compensation, and by the shipowners who for a time objected to paying dues where none had been paid beforeoIn the end the French Company realised that it was impossible to reinstate them unless a workable system of collecting dues from passing ships could be introduced, and the shipowners agreed to the principle that the lights should be financed by the passing ships but only on the condition that foreign ships   paid their fair share as well as British.     The problem therefore was to devise a system under which foreign Governments would agree that their ships should pay and the payment of dues could be enforced from individual foreign ships.The only workable system which the Board of Trade could see, after considering every possibility, was one under which all ships,  British or foreign, which passed the lights and afterwards touched at a British port should be compelled to pay their quota in respect of the lights.    This would have necessitated legislation here and in the British possessions concerned.    It would also have been necessary to obtain the consent or acquiescence of foreign Governments.    It would have been a difficult scheme to frame and to work, but it was the only one which, so far as ccnld be seen, would produce the cash necessary for maintaining these lights and obtain that money from ships which benefited by the lights.British shipowners have refused to agree to any proposal that they alone should bear the cost of the lights,  though they are ready to pay their quota of a levy on all shipsj    and have agreed to the Government making an international arrangement which will include foreign ships and secure the maintenance of the lights.
The Foreign Office, however,  objected very strongly to approaching foreign Governments with a scheme of this kind, and this solution had therefore to be abandoned.The Treasury have urged for some time that the cost of maintaining the lights should be removed from the Exchequer. Definite notice was given by the Treasury to the Board of Trade in April,  1926,  that no provision for these lights could be made in the Votes after the end of the current financial year in March,  1927,   and this decision was maintained by the Treasury at later dates.     The Treasury, have been informed of all the negotiations and efforts to formulate schemes for the maintenance of the lights, but they have now requested the Board of Trade to give the necessary notices for extinguishing the lights at once.    The issue of these notices may cause so much trouble and criticism that I feel bound to-ask for express Cabinet authority before taking this action0There is no doubt whatever in the mind of the Board of Trade,  and 1 believe the Admiralty entirely share this view, that these lights are necessary for navigation, and although the Departments concerned have valid reasons for objecting to maintain the lights at the sole expense of the Exchequer,  or to approach foreign Governments,  this will not absolve the Government from responsibility if the lights are put out by order of the British Government.   7e shall be asked why we, the principal maritime nation, put these important lights out on one of&apos; the main highways of the world when the British shipowners had agreed to pay their share and had promised to do their utmost to persuade their foreign colleagues to do the same. To this question there is no satisfactory ansvrer,  and if a foreign ship,  say,  an American ship, were to be wrecked on one of the islands owing to the extinction of the lights,   the position would be very difficult.
I,  therefore, am unwilling to issue the orders for the extinction of these lights without express Cabinet authority, and though I entirely agree with the Treasury that the cost is not one which they ought to bear,  I think there Is no real alternative to our continuing to pay for these lights from the Exchequer until we can bring into operation a workable scheme for placing the cost on the passing ships;(Initialled) p.c -LiBoard of Trade,4th January, 1927.
