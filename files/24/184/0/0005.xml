THIS DOUUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .iGRET. 00PY No* ,    &quot;   _.P. 5(S7).CABINET. TRADE QUTLOyK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, reports which I have received from members of-my Advisory Council, regarding the trade position and prospects.The present reports do not add materially to the review, which I circulated just before Christmas.    Engineering and other steel using trades are still held up awaiting a larger output of iron and steel.    The latter industry looks like having at any rate a six months run of active trade.More shipbuilding orders are being placed.    This is hopefulf and incidentally it justifies our discontinuance of Trade Facilities guarantees.The proposal to form a Minimum Price Association for cotton yarn is interesting.    Personally I think it is right, provided prices are fixed on a conservative spindle-value, and no attempt is made to maintain inflated values.    The Cabinet should observe the bearing of the Lancashire proposal on the proposal of the Lewis Committee on coal selling syndicates.    If the Cabinet agreed to compel a minority to enter a coal syndicate, how could we resist a similar demand from a yarn syndicate, which commanded 75;  support?    I have had the Information about the wool and worsted trade contained In the report supplemented from other sources.      I am afraid there is no doubt that the West Riding trade is very bad and that there is little hope of Improvement. Prices of French and German yarn and cloth are still considerably below what the West Riding oan meet.Board of Trade.P.O-L.

COAL.SIR ADAM NIMMO wrote:-&quot;The most important feature of the present position Is that, following the general resumption of work, agreements as to wages and hours and conditions of work have now been concluded In nearly all of the districts and that the negotiations have been carried through with a degree of smoothness and celerity which augurs well for future relationships between employers and employed.&quot;An equally hopeful sign is that the feeling among the workmen generally in the coalfields is excellent and that the high rates of output which are being obtained will be reflected in a substantial reduction of the excessive costs of production which have hampered the industry during the past few years and reacted so adversely both upon the other industries of the country and upon our coal export trade.&quot;Some time is necessary after the end of a prolonged stoppage of the mines for the restoration of normal conditions of work. Market conditions, too, are still affected by abnormal circumstances. Transport facilities both in the matter of the supply of wagons for inland transport and of tonnage for the shipment trade have not yet fully recovered.&quot;As conditions both on the side of demand and of supply have not yet reached stability it is a-little early to be able to make definite pronouncements as to the future, but it can be said with confidence that the immediate prospects, at any rate, in the coal industry are distinctly more encouraging than they have been at any time since the collieries were released from Government Control in 1921&quot;.IRON AND STEEL.MR. DORMAN stated that the number of blast furnaces in opera-tion at the beginning of the coal strike in April had been 147, whereas it was estimated that we now had about 50, and a good many more would be in operation in the next two or three weeks. The lack of coke was one of the reasons for the slight delay in re-starting, but coke was coming forward a good deal more freely now.It would be of no use to give the Council production figures for iron and steel, because production was almost non-existent during the strike period.    The imports during the period have, of course, been the highest on record.    The following figures had been got out showing for the first nine months of last year the iron and steel imports and exports of the United States, France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxemburg.
4 nCONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL (CONTP.) .	Iron and Steel Goods.		Imports.	Exports.Country.	Tons.

With regard to the last six months of the year one could not prophesy at all.    Shipbuilding seemed to be on the threshold of a revival;    the trade was rather more profitable, and .&quot;. good many orders were being placed.    The wire trade was rather quieter, and the sheet trade, which had been a staple trade of the country for some years, was also quieter than it had been for some time.   A report from Wales indicated that the tinplate industry was fairly good.    In constructional engineering., at the moment, not many orders were being booked;    but the rolling mills were getting into their stride and It w?vs confidently expected that there would be a revival of business.As regards European steel pacts and the International Rail Makers&apos; Associations, continental countries had come to an arrangement that after a certain rather large production had. been allocated to each country, an excess of that production was to be discouraged by payment of a certain sum of money per ton.    An invitation had been given to the British makers to join.    The position was resting there at the moment, and very likely would rest there for some time, because a good, many points required to be considered.    On the Continent they would appear to be losing the advantage they had had for a considerable time past   of their cost of production being noticeably less than ours.    The indications were that, given goodwill and effort in this country, the respective costs would come still nearer. We still had our troubles, in the matters of taxation and rather high railway rates, but if we could keep going at our full output, which we would be able to do for six months -one could not prophesy beyond that - the difference between the Continental prices and ours&apos; would be less than it had hitherto been.    The Continental makers saw that, and would welcome the co-operation of the British makers;    and it was probable they would accord us a considerable output tonnage;    but after that they would like to see the discouragement of excess production.
i 04 iron AND STEEL (CONTD.).British makers had to consider the effect on their customers -the shipbuilders, wiredrawers, and. constructional engineers.MR. BAEER had had reports from all the districts that blast furnaces were lighting up or blowing in, and during the next few months more furnaces  &quot;vere expected to be in blast than there were last April.   Some steel works were preparing for operation that had been closed before April.   The Scottish steelmakers had hoped to start in December, and had asked their men to work their holiday period for bare time,   The men agreed, but the employers had not been able to start up owing to a shortage of pig-iron.   Some of the works, however, were expecting to get started this month.   Tinplate was the best section at the present moment, but other sections would soon ge t under weigh.There was  a good deal of optimism about the trade  which Mr. Baker was afraid he did not share. It would be very pleasant if as much as two-thirds of the capital - invested in the trade  Aere employed even at the end of the next six months; and that, of course, would be merely getting back to the position that we were In at the end, say,  of 1925.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR reported, with regard to Sheffield, that the coal and coke situation was quite easy as regards supply, but not at all easy as regards price .   Steel-melting coke was still at  a figure at which the crucible steel trade of Sheffield could not bo cirried-on. The rolling mills and forges were in a position to do a good trade, but so far they had not been able to get hold of steel billets for the purpose. These were begin ling to dribble in, but in such small quanti-&apos; ties that one could not run a mill a whole week, because thero was not enough steel for it.As to trade on the&apos;Continent, the Spanish Royal Decree might perhaps, with firmness on our side, be withdrawn altogether.   The Spaniards were finding great difficulties in working it, and had had their attention drawn privately to other difficulties that might be expected.    Sheffield trade with France was practically dead, and most of the Sheffield firms had had to close down their organisations there altogether.    The Italian trade was falling off very considerably, and the Belgian trade also.   The adjustments necessitated by the stabilisation of the Belgian currency were not as easy for industrialists as might appear on the surface.&apos;   They included a good deal of writing clown of stocks and review of balance sheets; and in consequence the traders were holding off from buying. The Dutch trade was keeping up satisfactorily, and that with Japan had decidedly Improved, but trade with China was-o-
A QSTEEL (CONTD.) .extraordinarily difficult.   The trade of Sheffield with all the Dominions was good, particularly with Australia, and also Canada.There was a great deal of comment in the country about a concern called the saar British Steel Company.   The name gave people the Impression that it was British steel that the concern was making, but it was not; and they were competing with British makers with the advantage of the exchange.The President observed that there was no statutory power to prevent a  company operating abroad from registering itself here with a name which included the word &quot;British&quot;. But if the company in question sold their steel in this country with &quot;The Saar British Steel Company&quot; stamped on it, they would, under Section 1 of the Merchandise Marks Act of this year, have to mark it with an indication of its origin.Sir Aa Balfour also referred to a certain patent of a very wide character, relating to an alloy for use In steel, which was held by a German firm and was valid in Germany and a number of other countries, but not in Great Britain, for the firraTs application for patent protection had not succeeded here.   This firm was taking action in the other , countries referred to against persons who sent steel there containing this   alloy.   But the patent was unduly wide, and British steel makers would probably unite to fight the firm in those countries, as had been done In this country.SHIPBUILDING .SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT remarked that the tenders for the Chilean war vessels had been sent in to the Chilean Authorities a week or so ago.   Those Authorities had had tenders from all over the world, but it was believed that the British prices would make a fairly good showing in spite of the low prices quoted by Continental competitors for the materials from which the boats were built up. Further, the prices of propeller shafts, and other parts, were rather less in some of the foreign tenders than the price which had to be charged in this country.   This showed the handicap the British shipbuilder was up against.   With regard to the competition from Italy, apparently Italian firms had some scheme by which each firm took it in turn to get work.   If a firm had work already, and secured more, it was penalised In some way; or it arranged beforehand that, having got work, it would not tender again until the next firm had got an order.   That seemed to account for the way in which an Italian firm tendered in some cases and not in others.
soCOWFIDjiHTIAL.SHIPBUILDING- ( CQiJTD .) .Sir William Diamond, a ship repairer of great experience, had contributed an article about ship repairing to the special number of Lloyd&apos;s List giving a review of the year.   After pointing out the extent to which Continental firms, particularly Dutch, were securing repair work which legitimately should be done in this country, he referred to recent judicial decisions which were having a very serious effect on ship repairing.   He said -&quot;During the last few years, the law seems to have developed in a direction which threatens, unless it is checked by legislation, to put on ship repairers in this country a measure of liability so great as to force many firms out of business .&quot;-As a result of legal decisions, ship repairers, in an endeavour to protect themselves, had been bound to Insure against this unascertained legal liability.    The method adopted was to pay a premium based on the wages paid.   To cover this risk, on a ship valued at a million and a half, premiums amounted to as much as 34s. per cent.   As things stood at present, a repairing firm who undertook work valued at quite a small amount might be held liable by the underwriters who had covered the marine risks, for the whole value of the ship (or even more if she was under-insured) in the event of some accident or fire occurring which it could be argued had resulted from the negligence of some of his workmen. Ship repairing in the past had given a lot of employment. It would be a disastrous thing if oonditions in this country made it impossible for firms to,compete with others abroad who did not work under the same diffl-culties.The underwriter took two premiums in this class of case for insurance against fire or other risk.    He paid the shipowner when some accident occurred, and then came to the man who had done the repairs,- and said, &quot;You are negligent.   I will recover the money from you&quot;. That was thought by ship repairers to be unreasonable, and a case had been taken to the House of Lords.-  There had since been many such cases in which the underwriters had recovered at law,and the only course was for the ship repairers to insure; but it was a most onerous thingThe President observed that It seemed to be a case in which the ship repairers should approach the shipowner with a view to them both trying to get the insurers to charge a lower premium to the owner in the first instance because the underwriter would have a measure of relief as against the repairer in the event of an accident occurring.   It would seem to be hardly possible to get the law altered in this matter.
CONFIDENTIAL. ENGINEERING.MR. BRGWNLIE observed that reports received recently-indicated that a large number of patternmakers were being found employment.-   The number was in the region of 200 who had been out of employment for a considerable period.    That was the best possible indication as to what would happen in due course to the moulders, machine-men and other v^orkers.   The Amalgamated Engineering Union had found, from the returns relating to the end of November last, that their unemployment figures had been reduced by over 1,000, and they were hopeful that the next returns which they would get in the course of a   -day or so, would show a further reduction in those figures. The percentage of unemployment at present among the members of the Union would be between 13.5 and 14;    but the figure for the whole of the year was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 11.66.As regards the promotion of industrial peace, of which every well-disposed person saw the urgent necessity, it was doubtful whether the public efforts which were being made in some quarters outside the trades themselves would have any good effect.    Peace in industry, being essentially a matter of good relations between workpeople and the employers, must come from the workshops and not be super-imposed.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.SIR PHILIP NASH recalled that he had reported fully at the middle of last month and there had not been any time for a change in the position.    (A summary of Sir P. Nash&apos;s December report is given immediately below).   Briefly, the electrical engineering business hoped to have a promising year in front of it.    It would probably get an improvement in the home market which had been depressed for many months.    That was indeed the principal thing It looked forward to.Summary of Sir Philip Nash&apos;s Report on the Electrical Industries, dated December 14th last, and already circulated.Normally there was a steady home demand, but for many months this had been greatly reduced owing, chiefly, to the coal strike and the lapse of time in passing the Electricity Bill. Now, however, there were prospects of making up the lee-way. Increased interest was being shown in electrical apparatus, in particular for domestic purposes.In the overseas markets British manufacturers were obtaining a good and fairly steady share of the business offer-ing.    The prices at which they secured contracts In face of
r iELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES (CONTD.) .world competition might be said to be unremunerative, but the volume of work was vital to the welfare of the industry, not only from the standpoint of providing employment, but also that of gaining experience in the most modern developments, for which there was at present no demand in this country.COTTON.COLONEL SEDDOTT BROViTJ stated that no figures, were available in respect of the spinning industry since the holidays.   But taking the American spinning trade first, for the week which ended on Christmas Day, the spinning mills in the American section produced about 70 per cent,    of their normal output. Unfortunately, however, less than this weight was sold and less than this weight was delivered.    Short-time working in this section of the trade had been withdrawn, not because demand was sufficient to justify longer hours, but owing to lack of loyalty on the part of the members to observe the recommenda-tions of the Short-Tine Committee.   As a result prices had broken even worse than ever, and at a public meeting of the trade it had been estimated that Lancashire was now losing over  1,000,000 sterling per week.There had been a large meeting of the trade, the object of which was to solicit membership for the new American Yarn Association.   This Association claimed that 14,000,000 spindles had applied for membership, but it was understood that they did not intend to go to allotment unless applications were received from 70 per cent,    of the spindles in Lancashire which were employed in spinning American cotton.    Their object was to form a bottom or basis price below which no spinner should go, leaving the spinner free to get as much above that price as possible.    The further object was that this minimum price should be enforced by penalties,  and the uncalled capital would be available in case fines were imposed upon spinners for breakiug  the rules of the Association.    There was much differe: ce of opinion upon this matter.    There were two distinct classes in the cotton industry of Lancashire, the reconstructed concerns and the old concerns;    and there was a natural disinclination on the part of the old cheaply-capitalised concerns to link up in any movement at all with the heavily-capitalised firms.    That was the trouble.    The Association intended to take what was considered to be the fair cost of a spindle and fix the price oh that.    It would not be sufficient, probably, to cover the expenses of a heavily-capitalised concern, and it might be a very good price for one which was cheaply capitalised.   But there was the disinclination of these latter firms to take part in any movement at all.    That was what broke down the short-time movement.
COTTON (CONTD).in the Egyptian seat Ion they were running full time. Prices were rather worse and it was certainly not doing as well as.it has been doing.     In cloth there were still a great many looms standing idle.As regards demand-, there was certainly a better demand from India, especially for fine cloths, but they were still offering very low prices.     Lancashire was feeling acutely at the moment the lack of demand from China, which was almost nil.As the Council were perhaps aware, the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos;and Manufacturers&apos; Associations was holding a conference in Egypt this month, at the request of the Egyptian Government.     It was hoped that this would do a lot of good with regard to many matters in connection with raw cotton, and-with regard to our sales of cloth and yarn in that country.SIR WILLIAM CLARE LEES wrote&quot;Very little change has taken place in the Cotton Trade during the last two or three weeks.     A continuous stream of sa&amp;sll  orders still find their way on to the Order Books, but they are not suffieient in volume to appreciably Increase the machinery already occupied.     Where business is booked to any extensive quantity it is local in character, and whilst putting individual firms into e stronger position is not large enough to have much effect upon the general position of the Trade. On the other hand consumption goes on abroad end the exports that are being sent forward are passing   into consumption, and in some markets stocks are appreciably lower than they were this time last year.&quot;The end of the year always brings a crop of troubles with it.      One hears of some failures in Cairo carrying losses to Manchester Houses, and it is inevitable in almost all markets thst after so heavy a decline in values, considerable trouble must emerge as a result.     This all has a depressing effect upon the outlook of those engaged in the trade and has at the present time engendered an attitude of caution which is probably less necessary than it has been for many years past, so far as values are concerned.&quot;&quot;Until the world abandons the habit of looking backwards confidence must be lacking.      If prices remain stable at their present low level a return of confidence must surely come, and it is on this hope Manchester is pinning her faith.&quot;WOOL.COLONEL WILLEY stated   that in the wool textile trade there was very little change in December from the previous month. Employment showed an improvement.    In so far as one could make, any deduction in the absence of authoritative statistics, the. ,
5&apos; 4WOOL (CONTD).wool consumption of the country In 1926 had been rather larger than in 1925, though both years .were bad as compared with 1924. The orders on the order sheets were few.     There was but a slight disposition to buy ahead, and that made the operation of machinery very expensive.     Still, values were on the whole considered reasonable, averaging about 30 per cent, above pre-war.As regards future years, it ^as too early yet to see any result from an increased demand in the home trade, and as far as exports were concerned we were not yet able to see any effect from the increasing gold cost on the Continent.     Inquiries had been made from leading international merchants - that is, importers and exporters of wool textiles - who had normally placed very large orders in England for textiles for export as well as for domestic consumption.       One of the largest of these firms stated that last year they bought practically nothing in England, as against some millions which they bought abroad; that the situation had not actually changed, in so far as French manufacturers could still deliver their goods in spite of the increasing gold cost internally, but that the sentimental factor had changed a good deal. &apos;  In the last 18 months any buyer of textile goods from most European countries had not been interested even in quotations of British goods, because it was taken for granted that they would be above the market level by comparison with French, Belgian and Italian quotations, but now there was a tendency once more to enquire for British prices, which again was a sentimental and not a practical move, but still it meant a good deal of difference. It was to be anticipated that this increasing gold cost on the Continent would make it much easier for this country to compete in the export trade than formerly.In connexion with the silk (not artificial silk)Industry, some very interesting figures had appeared during the last two weeks with regard to an increase in employment which had occurred As a result of the safeguarding duties the volume of business done in the country in this industry was 10 per cent, larger than last year and 40 per cent, larger than the year before. It might be argued that if these duties were imposed as a safe-guard against a foreign luxury trade, then, in the case of wool, there was a great difference in values between the wool which would be required for ordinary consumption and the luxury wools, and there might be a case for having a duty on the luxury article as distinct from the necessary artiole.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR ADDISON said that this was a very slack period of the year in regard to artificial silk,.    In spite of Colonel Seddon Brown1s rather pessimistic report as regards Lancashire, one found there an undercurrent of Interest stirring: and the same applied to Yorkshire.     Perhaps one of the most hopeful
ARTIFICIAL SILK (CONTD).signs was that buyers were no longer under the deep depression in which they laboured for so many months. Speaking generally, they^ were distinctly more hopeful as regards the current year.In regard to the home market, the Leicester and Nottingham trades were continuing busy, but otherwise the. market showed signs of easing off.       Inquiries as regards the Continent showed that the producers of artificial silk there had got their troubles, especially in France and in Italy. Germany appeared to be the only country which was actually running full time and able to sell every ounce they could produce.     As to the overseas markets, there had been a little lull in India, and the price charged by the Continental -dumpers there showed a tendency to rise very distinctly. As regards China, things ware in a very chaotic condition, and the same remark applied, for a different reason, to Japan. The Japanese market was in a very disturbed state;  so much so that the importing houses were clearing out their stocks and selling them for whatever price they would fetch.       The trade in Australia continued good, and there was every reason to think that trade in 1927 would be very satisfactory.   The South American trade, for various reasons, was not particularly good.     One of the big difficulties that British manufacturers were up against there was the question of giving long credits to firms of doubtful stability.     Business in Canada continued to be good.     One of the most interesting points in connection with the safeguarding duty on artificial silk was this, that the Continental spinners were no longer regarding this market as a dumping ground, and were directing their efforts to the United States.     They were not having much success there because of the high tariff,  but the effect had been to reduce prices in the United States very materially. Speaking generally, we were hoping to have quite a reasonably good year.POTTERY.MR HOLLINS observed that the pottery export trade had suffered owing to the coal stoppage, with the exception of the fine china section which had increased.    As regards the home trade we had no really comparable data, but we must obviously have recovered considerably since the beginning of September. The factories had been working very well Indeed.   The outlook was consequently hopeful in the trade, provided that the enhanced prices due to the coal strike did not have a prejudicial affect.    It was understood that the manufacturers intended to maintain the higher prices for some time yet.
P- ftPOTTERY (CONTD.).The unemployment figures at the moment were slightly in excess of the corresponding period for last year. They naturally tended to increase about this time because there was a temporary lull at this period which ocourred every year.The outlook differed in the various sections of the trade.   The sanitary trade and the tile trade would naturally have a long period of prosperity to look forward to, because of the building operations.     The general earthenware trade and the electrical fittings trade would follow next, probably, in importance.    The china and the stoneware trades might be at the tail end, so far as the prosperity of their outlook was concerned.    On the whole, prospects appeared to be fair.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR. GALLAGHER reported that the Society&apos;s sales amounted to rather under  9,000.000 for the six months ending December 25th last.    They showed a decrease in all departments during that period of about 7 per cent, compared with the same six months of the previous year.    The decreases were larger in what were called the luxury departments.    For instance, in drapery the sales were less by 10 per cent, and in furnishing by 12 per cent.       In grocery the decrease was 7 per cent.,  and in boots only lir per cent.      Considering the stoppage of seven months, they thought these results were not at all bad. Further, the statement of quantities did not show a decrease of as much as 7 per cent.The Retail Societies had increased their indebtedness to the Wholesale by almost 100 per cent.    The Co-Operative movement in Scotland must have lost about  1,000,000 of its oapital through the stoppage; that is, by members drawing on their savings,  and the Retail Societies, in their turn, drawing on their deposits with the Wholesale Society.    When it was considered that there were 750,000 members (and one must multiply that by 4 to get the number of individuals associated with the movement), and that at least 30 per cent, of those people were connected with mines, and another 20 or 50 per cent, would have been thrown, either partially or wholly, out of employment because of the stoppage, they might oongratulate themselves in coming out so well.So far as the future was concerned, they had not as yet seen much sign in the sales of any great recovery, but It was thought that in the course of a month or so there would be better news to report *Mr. Gallacher went on to refer to the wheat pools, and the proposal to have a combination between them with a view to
SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY (CONTD.).rationing the world&apos;s market of wheat.   Wheat prices In thia country had &quot;been affected for some little time on this account and the matter might develop seriously enough to require Government intervention^The President pointed out that the issue was whether the people who were producing could control production and price. The adoption of a Government purchasing organisation&apos;in place of the ordinary wheat market would not affect that.    On the contrary,  to substitute a single Government purchasing agency for a number of private purchasers would in hie view tend to play into the hands of the producers&apos; pools.GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE.SIR FELIX SCHUSTER said that the general impression to be derived from the reports of the branches of the National Provincial Bank was a hopeful and optimistic one.    That applied speoially to the metal trades.     Iron and steel makers reported that they were full of orders.    Whether they could carry them out was another question, but they epoke very hopefully.    It also applied to shipbuilding, where prospects were more promising.    Lancashire was still depressed, but it was thought that the low prioe of cotton would produce better business.    As regards agriculture, reports as to the results of last year were not at all good.As to the banking situation, again there was quite a hopeful feeling,  and Sir F. Schuster thought that the next few months would show that that was quite justified. People were anticipating a lowering of the Bank rate in the near future.    That could only take place to a very moderate extent - perhaps a rate of 4f- per cent,, might be conceivable.    But whatever the Bank of England did, we must expect very tight money during the next three months. The public did not fully realise the financial pressure which would be bound to come.    Facilities would continue to be given to traders, but it could not be expected that they would be given at lower rates than those prevailing at the present moment.   Bank advances were very high, higher than the banks would like to see them, but they would continue the policy of supplying trade requirements. The banks could not have carried on a lOBing industry indefinitely, but now traders were showing that at least they were paying expenses and overhead charges,  and were finding themselves in a more solvent condition.IS-
GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE (CONTD.)To turn to Germany, the reports about German prosperity appear to have been too sanguine.    The Germans had caused a good deal of gold to be taken from here, but that was not on account of flourishing trade conditions;    it was only due to their borrowing abroad, especially from the United States. The United States had paid the loans by withdrawing their deposits here and paying with gold from here.   But that had been very much overdone;    it was unsound from the German point of view, and would make itself felt in Germany later. A confidential report had been received to the effect that fhile certain industries in Germany, which were very much in the public eye, were doing quite well, they did not reflect the general position of .the country, which was still one of great distress in many quarters.    They were forcing trade with Russia against their will; but that was the only country where they could find an outlet for some of their manufactures. The German banks did not like the business at all, but found they were compelled to assist It.   However, they had made up their minds that they would go up to a certain point to encourage Russian business, but v,ould go no further.   They had combined to put up together a single industrial company which was looking after and watching the matter, credits to Russia being limited to a certain agreed figure.    The reparation payments from Germany had only been half what they were going to be; next year there would be a heavy rise, and in the year after there would be twice as much to pay as last year; it would remain to be seen whether they could really meet their payments under the Dawes Scheme.Conditions in Austria were not satisfactory at all.    In Belgium they were much better, and their scheme of stabilisation-tion seemed to answer.   In France everything was in a state of considerable doubt, and traders were not happy.   With regard to Italy, trade had not been very good there, and they had suffered from the French exchange.   The new Government Loan had been a success, but it was practically a forced loan, and it was at a considerable discount.    Conditions on the Continent   generally were, therefore, not very satisfactory, and it did not seem as if we could expect them to import largely from this country.MR. GURRI3 had little to add to what had been said by Sir Felix Schuster.   At the moment the London Money Market was very easy, chiefly owing to the large amount which had been borrowed from the Bank of England over the end of the year.    That, combined with a possible reduction in the Bank Rate, had made the bill rate materially easier.    There was a markedly improved feeling on the Stock Exchange, and Government securities had nearly all risen.    The general opinion there appeared certainly to be hopeful;    more so perhaps than it had been for some time,MR. VYLE stated that in Germany and Austria there had been a wide and rapid development in the last six months of what was known as the hire-purchase system.    Credits were being given to every consumer, on quite small things, running from six to eighteen months.   An enoimtous capital -was, however,
GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE (CONTD. )required to start a scheme of that kind on a large scale, and it would be of some importance to know - because this was a very heavy weapon in the hands of, our competitors - how it happened that in Germany and Austria they were able to give such wide and long credits on this instalment system.In Russia,  a concession had lately been granted under which the entire manufacture in one particular line had been handed over to one concern, and this meant that no one could  send anything In that line into Russia except through the concessionnaires.   These concessionnaires happened to he a group of French people, who were supported by Germans, Swiss, Americans and, it was thought, some English.   But there was no longer a free market in the goods in question. No other such concession had been heard of for the moment, but it 7/as possible that it might be followed by others sold or&quot;&apos;farmed out by Russia.with regard to the home trade, the latest reports from the Chambers of Commerce continued to show the existence of a feeling of confidence that there was going to be an improve-ment in trade in the near future; but the heavy trades were moving slowly, and until these heavy trades reached a stage of good production, the others which depended upon them would not be able to do very much.In Liverpool, in the timber trade there was quite an optimistic feeling, but they complained of an increase In freight rates operative from the 1st January, and anticipated that much higher prices would have to be charged for timber both hard and soft.    The coal trade had again become normal. The main difficulty was transport, and whilst the railways were trying to straighten out the coal traffic muddle, the general movement of finished goods and semi-manufactured articles was bein  delayed.The Aberdeen report about the fish trade was that the home demand had improved,  and they were also shipping again to French and other foreign markets quite heavily.In Hull the engineering and shipbuilding trades were reported still to he held up for want of materials and suitable foundry coke, but otherwise they were looking forward to a fair amount of business.    The losses of trawler-owners had been enormous during the coal strike;    the amounts realised did not cover the amount of the coal bill, and this was said to be due to the amount of foreign fish dumped into the oountry.In Leicester there was a temporary lull In employment In the boot and shoe trade, pending a start on Spring and Summer ranges.COLONEL WILLEY remarked that when the representatives of the Federation of German Industry were over here lately they explained how their Government credit for Russia was worked.     By far the larger amount of ordinary credits were
GENERAL TRAPS AND FINANCE (CONTP.)by short-term bills for supplies from Russia such as cotton, wool, tea, rubber, hides and so on, as against steel and articles of hypo the cable value exported to Russia from Germany. The German Government credits only applied to exports of articles like steel and not to consumable stores.     There appeared, therefore, to be no arrangement in Germany for the concentration through a single channel of the export business of the largest value, which would be consumable stores, and not steel, etc.     And it appeared that what the consortium of banks was operating were these Government-assisted credits only.MR. HOSE,  alluding to the question of the financing of German business from this country, pointed out that in the news-papers there had been criticism of certain banks for reducing charges for acceptance business.   That applied with equal force to the reduction of rates,  - which he thought were quite unnecessary, - in regard to cash business.    It seemed to be quite right to penalise the German importer, as compared with the British importer, by charging him a somewhat higher rate. But the competition from the British banks had reduced the margin of interest to such an extent that the Germans could now get the same terms for their export business as were given to the British manufacturer.    Could there not be some arrange-ment between the British banks, instead of this competition between them, as to their rates for financing foreign business, so as to encourage the trade of this country by charging a higher price to foreign countries than they charge to the British manufacturer?Sir Felix Schuster agreed that the recent reduction of rates appeared to be unnecessary.    No doubt, however, there had been some good reason for this action on the pax&quot;t of one bank;    and the other banks had had to come Into line.   However, that rate was not such an exceptional one as had been generally assumed.    There was a case in the National Provincial Bank where that rate had prevailed since about 1890.    As to such a rate benefiting the foreign trader at the expense of the British trader, Sir F. Schuster was unable to admit the argument.    No doubt the lower rates in Holland and Switzerland had taken a certain amount of British business to those countries temporarily, but it did not amount to very much.Mr. Hose&apos;s suggestion that banks snould make an arrange-ment in order to agree on a certain rate to be charged was extremely difficult to carry out, because there were always some special cases which demanded consideration;    and it was not a plan which would be desirable in any circumstances.    He thought that the last thing that would be wisissed at this Council and in the country genex-ally was that thex,e should be any cartel of banks in ox^dex1 to create a specified x*ate and do away with competition.    Six&apos; Ax&quot;thux- Balf,:ur had just reminded him that if we did such a thing, the business would at   once go away to the United States.
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB said that the most recent available figures of tonnage carried were for October and had now perhaps lost interest.   In gross receipts up to the 26th December the four groups were down, compared with the corresponding period during last year, by  27., 500,000.    The only other point which called for mention at the moment was the wagon position.    The railway companies had made  special efforts during the Christmas holidays to relieve shortages, more particularly in domestic coal, not without success.   And as the import of foreign coal decreased, and the wagon stock flowed back into its normal channels, it was to be hoped that the transport difficulty would disappear.   The railway companies were very ^uch alive to the importance of removing the existing difficulties, which were not of their own making.   The prolonged stoppage left them in a difficult position at a bad time of the year for railway working.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that the unemployment figures remained very high, but the cessation of the coal dispute, coupled with the requirements of the Christmas trade, had had some effect in reducing the total.   The lowest point so far reached since the end of the dispute was on December 20th when the figure, exclusive of coal workers still disqualified for benefit, was 1,310,000.   That was 250,000 below the highest figure reached in the latter part of the coal dispute, which was on the 8th November.    In the course of the week immediately before Christmas there was an increase of about 42,000, but a large part of that was probably due to coal workers coming on the register and qualifying for benefit; and this did not, of course, mean a real increase in the number of unemployed.    In accordance with the experience of past years, a considerable increase in the unemployment figures was to be expected in the next week or two,  owing to people being discharged over Christmas.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON said that although final figures for  the wheat crop in Australia were not yet available there was a certainty of a very excellent crop, with the possibility of a record one.   The damage done by the bush fires was probably negligible, as it had occurred in scattered areas. There had been some difficulty in the shipment of wheat.The wool sales were being resumed this week and it was hoped that prices would be maintained. The labour troubles connected with the shipment of wool-, which started in South Australia   .and had showed signs of spreading elsewhere, had now been settled.
CONFIDENTIAL. AUSTRALIAN TRADE  (CONTD.).One rather serious item from the point of view of Victoria was the attack by insect pests    on the apple crop, which was likely seriously   to reduce the quantity available for export; and it was also reported that In Tasmania there might be a falling off in the exportable crop.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY, referred to what Colonel Seddon Brown had said in regard to the classification of the Lancashire cotton mills In two groups, according to their financial soundness or otherwise, said that the Indian cotton mills fell exactly into the same two groups; but this was on account of their geographical, not their financial, situation.   The Bombay and Bengal mills were in a very bad way; whereas the up-country mills were on the whole holding their own.Ke had just had from India figures showing the consumption of cotton in the Indian mills,  grouped by Provinces, during the last three years.    (These figures will be found at the end of the Minutes).   Summarised, it was simply that in the season 1924-5 Bombay and Bengal increased their consumption of Indian cotton over the season before, but in the season 1925-6 the consumption, was down again, even lower than two seasons ago.   In the other group of up-country mills there was  a steady rise all through the three seasons.    There was possibly some-thing in the contention that if airy protection were given to the cotton trade the whole  advantage would probably go to the up-country mills which did not require it.    In regard to the cotton position generally in India, the pro-duction figures had just been received for raw cotton. The Indian cultivator, in view of what was being done in America,had reduced his acreage by 4,000,000 acres, and India1s  total production had been diminished by 1,000,000 bales - from 6,000,000 to 5,000,000 bales.With respect to trade in general, exports had dropped very much in November, the very month when they ought to be going up, and it looked as if there was going to h.. .i c serious postponement of the busy season.   In fact the November export figure was lower than that for any month in the last three or four years.    That was partly due to the -decline in prices, but not wholly, because the November figure was actually one-third below the average of the monthly export values of 1925, whereas prices had only dropped 10 per cent.    On the other hand, since November there had been indications that the position was improving again on the whole, and the rise in the Bank Rate since 1st January from 4 to 5 per cent, showed that there was a keener demand for money than there had been for some months past.
INDIAN TPADE  (CONTD.).A propos    of what Mr. Gallacher had said (see section on the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society) about producers&apos;  organisations,  it might be  well to draw attention to the Viceroy s speech to the Associated Chambers of Commerce at Cawnpore on 6th December, in which he spoke of the vital need of organising production in India.    One of the good results of such organisation would undoubtedly be that the Indian producer would be in a position to meet requirements in this country much more closely than hitherto0   Lack of organisation had meant that the producers competed amongst themselves, and that it was not possible to Insist on such a high standard of quality in exported goods as was required.    In all sorts of staple lines, of trade from India there was adulteration and a deficiency in quality which could only be improved by organisation in that country.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE .&quot;reported that the Argentine wheat crop was expected to be a bumper one.   Prospects were not quite so good in the case of oats and linseed, but these were not of the same importance as wheat, which was now an assured thing, free from any risk of frost after about the middle of this month.    The position of the maize crop was not yet so certain, but the recent rains had raised the hope that there would even be a bumper crop of maize.   The cessation of the coal strike in Great Britain resulted in freights for homeward cargoes being relieved by the assurance that there would be  an outward freight available.In Chile there was a little more hopefulness in the matter of nitrate.   The makers of nitrate had been demand-ing that there should be a complete cessation of the export duty.   That was easy to propose but difficult to grant. The Chilean Government had always taken a very firm stand and said they would not even reduce the duties.   In that they had been encouraged by Guggenhelms&apos; claim that their new process was going to enable them to supply all the world with nitrate at prices which could pay the duties. But there was now a possibility that they might give way, more especially as it had been pointed out to them that they could secure approximately the same amount of revenue in other directions.In Mexico a limitation of the rights of the holders of mining and oil concessions was coming into force as from the first of this month.    It appeared that there would be a good deal of litigation on the application of the law, and probably a very serious curtailment of the operations of the oil companies.
CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.).The incident in Nioaragua might be dismissed with the observation that,  coming after the failure, in the Mexican dispute, of arbitration by President Coolidge, it seemed likely to create still further prejudice against the United States in Central and South America.TRADE IN CHINA.MR. LANDALE reported that in British shipping in China business had improved.    The two southern ports of Canton and Swatow were now normal and freights had been raised considerably.   Here was an instance in which the artificial agitation had been withdrawn and the recovery had been rapid.With regard to exports from China, there had been considerable difficulty in delivering cargo at the Treaty Ports owing to the disturbed Btate of the country and the occupation of the railways by troops.   Owing also to the disturbed state of the country and the fall in the price of silver,  the import market had been greatly disturbed and very little business was being transacted. The same conditions applied to engineering.    All the railways were again auffering from military interference.Those interested in trade with China expressed very great satisfaction at the decision displayed by H.M.Government In assuming the initiative in regard to the present situation in China, where British interests were greater than those of any1 other Power.    It was &quot;satisfactory that concrete evidence had been given of the desire of H.M. Government to meet as far as possible the Chinese view.    The country was at present In a state of chaos, with many warring factions,  and it was very doubtful whether the Chinese could themselves restore peace without aid from outside.    It was a peacemaker that was required.   Even the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party were very disunited.Mr. Landale read the following extract from a letter from Peking replying to an enquiry which had been made as to what sort of a Government this Nationalist Party would form .&quot;All past experience of Kuomintang mentality shows it to be extremely Chauvinistic, and leads one to suppose that their policy would be to complete the destruction of foreign influence in the country by means of Treaty abrogation.   With Foreign Powers disunited and . prepared to submit to unreasonableness, I should expect a Kuomintang Government to be highly unreasonable.
TRADE IN CHINA (OONTD.).They would in particular be anti-British, as this is the easiest line of attack against the whole Foreign position.    We have shown that we can do nothing to defend our Treaty rights,- which were won by force and could only be retained by foroe - so there will be no choice but to yield whatever Is required.    If, on the other hand, the Powers or Britain alone were ready to say to any recognizable Government which may emerge, &apos;We will revise our Treaty position upon such and such &quot;lines, to bring it into modern shape, but we will &apos;oppose resolutely any further attempt to coerce us&apos;, thore would be in the light of all past experience the certainty that reasonableness would prevail&quot;.-SO-

Statement made at the meeting of the Advisory Committeeto the Department of  Overseas Trade held on Wednesday,the 15th December, 1926,  regarding the export trade position.SIR GEORGE BUTTON  (Cable industry)  said they were doing good business in Australia and in New Zealand, but the Chinese market was a closed one.      One of their difficulties was the  instability of conditions abroad and the difficulty in getting foreign bodies to carry out their engagements.      The cable trade did not regard the wireless trade as likely to take away their business.COLONEL COLE (Motor industry)  stated that people seemed to think that the industry was in a very prosperous state.      This was not borne out by the facts.      The results of three important companies had been published lately and disclosed that in one  case a loss of  71,000 had been sustained on a capital of  300,000;    in another the profit had been reduced from  108,000 to  46,000 and in a third there had been a loss of  123,000.Meetings had taken place with the Dominion Prime Ministers, under the  auspices of the Department,  and the trade proposed to send an expert delegation to Australia, New&quot;Zealand,  South Africa and India,  to study those markets.       A sum of  5,000 was also being spent on an advertising campaign in Australia.MR. ROWLAND  (Agricultural machinery)  stated that as regards  the export trade, he had sounded his competitors with a view to their joining forces and he  thought there were reasonable prospects of the proposals taking a practical form.As regards the Argentine market,  his group had only utilised  15,000 to  20,000 of the  credit that had been granted to them, but they had had to make sure  that the machines which they proposed to ship were in all respects satisfactory.      They had tested    them on the ground and found that they were  satisfactory and he hoped that next year they would take up a large proportion of the-balance of  the credit outstanding, namely  400,000.      They were appointing resident technical representatives in South Africa,  India, Australia and New Zealand, who would supervise their existing agencies and report developments.      It was also probable that    visits of individual directors would be made from time to time.      He thought that in future their aim would be the development of trade in ordinary standard lines instead of in speciality goods.MR. VYLE (Hardware and metals)  said that,  in the export trade, a good many enquiries put out during the stoppage had resulted in business.      The prospects for the future were  reasonably good.MR. WOOLCOOK (Chemical trade) reported that the heavy side had been more affected by the coal stoppage than other sections.     The prospects of sulphuric acid, which was regarded as a barometer of the trade,  were bad.      The position in regard to alkali was much mere satisfactory,  but in the dye stuffs section,  on the other hand, the situation was not hopeful.In relation to the fine chemical branch, the  Safeguarding of Industries Act had had a very good effect.      They were producing enough to satisfy the domestic demand and were gradually finding their way into the export markets.      The statement that the German
If ADye Trust had discovered and developed a coal distillation process which could be worked on a commercial scal.e was not proved.      Such a development would be of great importance to the  coal industry and the oil companies were keenly interested in the matter.MR. PARKER (Boots and shoes)  stated that a. large business was being done in the Irish Free State, but that the tariff was adversely affecting the business, particularly because no drawback was allowed on returned goods.MR, BOOTHMAN (Cotton - Labour-) said that more time was being worked in the American Section,  but the prospects, did not appear to be very good.MR. HOLROYD (Cotton spinning)  stated that the situation was gloomy and If there had been any change since the last meeting it had been for the worse .      The cost of raw material was even lower than it had been two months ago, but buyers were still holding off, waiting for rock bottom prices to be reached.    The situation in China was depressing.      Keen competition was being experienced from Japan and Italy.      At an International Conference which he had recently attended, he had been informed that the Italian trade was worse than it had been.      The difficulty in the establishment of a cartel was that at present only 50 per cent of the trade had indicated that they were in favour of the proposal.COLONEL PEEL  (Export Credits)   stated that the figures of business done since the new scheme was initiated were disappointing.    Since July, when the scheme came into force, bills to the amount of  55,000 only had been guaranteed.      This was less than 10 per cent of the  sanctions granted.      It might be  that this large discrepancy between the sanctions  and the guarantees was due to the fact that exporters,  and particularly bankers, had confidence in the Department and the Advisory Committee,  and that when the Department had granted a sanction they found they were able  to give the required facilities themselves.      To this extent&apos;,  there-fore,  the scheme was serving the public.      One of the obstacles to further progress was the surprising ignorance of the facilities available.      He drew attention to the Portuguese credit which had been a great success and thought it might be useful If the Department could give  the time to think out some further schemes of this nature.In the Credit Insurance schema we had a valuable experiment which was not costing the taxpayer anything.      It was practically making no losses,  and the premium revenue was sufficient to meet the cost of operating the scheme.MR. DODWELL (China merchant trade)  stated that everything depended on the Canton Government which had run the south better than any Chinese Government before.      He thought it worthy of report that enquiries had been made in the insurance market for cover for  400,000 worth of arms which were being shipped    to Chang-tso-Lin last week from Germany, who were not signatories to the Arms Convention.      Trade was slightly better and deliveries of goods which had been lying in the warehouse for some months had recently been effected,    butthe merchandise was still taken without the &quot;chops&quot;.      As far as the north was concerned,   they were not doing any business except against old contracts.MR. LINDSAY/
MR. LINDSAY (India)  stated, In regard to the general position,  that the movement was towards a reversion to normal conditions.      They had had good monsoons and had been fortunate with their produce.      At the present time of the  year it was expected that the exports would show an increase, but the rise in values had been checked by the fall in jute and cotton and also to a lesser extent in tea, with the result that there was no increase in export, but a slight advance in the import figures. Imports of gold had been reduced recently and were less than those for 1913.      In fact,  the rupee was showing signs of weakness, but was^being kept by the Government within the gold points 1. ofd - 1.6-3/l6d.      He had just received the latest trade returns, from which it appeared that continental business with India had expanded,  but not to any great extent.      It was a remarkable  thing that the countries with depreciated currency except Italy, had lost ground, while those with steady exchanges had improved their position.As regards piece goods the dealers&apos; ideas of prices were still    less than the quotations ;which they received, but more interest was being shown and there was  confidence in the pie.ce goods market.      The following table represented the position held by India in regard to purchases of cotton goods in relation to the total exports from this country:-1911 1912 1913 1925 1924 1925 1926  (10 months)percentage of -India&apos;s pur-chases of British cotton piece goods::&apos;     36    40        43      34     37      32 41total exports from the United Kingdom,As regards the  iron and steel industry,  the share of the trade held by the United Kingdom before the war was 70 per cent., whilst from the 1925/192-6 figures it amounted to 67.7 per cent.MR.  GRAY BUCHANAN (Iron and steel,. India merchant trade) stated    that,  from his experience, the Trade Commissioners in Australia and New Zealand&apos; would be able to render the motor industry considerable assistance.In regard to shipbuilding,  one Scotch Works had sufficient orders on hand to keep them going for 4vv years, while a North country firm had sufficient business on their books for 2 years.      People who took the long view were Investing capital in shipbuilding and this would seem to be a hopeful sign.The  Argentine Railways were making such good profits, that it would not only be possible, but necessary, to spend a portion in new rolling stock,  and Mr.  Buchanan anticipated that a fair proportion of the business would come to this country.      Generally speaking, he thought the prospects of the iron and steel industry were encouraging.
