COPY lo..p. 14 ( 27) CABHIiT .PuSD LIGETd.H^PAILuUS BY TEJ PIRdT LORD OF the ADMIRALTY..I agree.with the remarks contained in the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade f CP. 3(27))The view of the Admiralty is that these lights are essential for navigation.      Shipping casualties (involving loss to British owners or insurance companies)  led to tho demand for their establishment, and if they arc extinguished, either such accidents will almost inevitably occur, or shipping in both directions will be considerably delayed, with a consequent increase of expense,  in order that this portion of the Red Sea. may bo avoided during the dark hours. Moreover, it is probable that the extinction of these lights would cause sach a public outcry that some method of re-establishing them would have to be found.While this Department does not consider that these particular islands are of stratogic value, great importance is attached to the maintenance of our influence in this area, in view of its position on the main route to the Far Bast, and the possibility of the islands being taken over and the lights administered by any other Power is viewed with considerable disfavour.flnltd)   W.C.3.ADMIRALTY , 3-VM.18th January  1927.
