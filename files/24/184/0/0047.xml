THIS DOCUMENT    13 THE PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS government*MENT,SECRET. . COPY NO._CP. 47 (27).CABINET. TRADE OUTLOOK . Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, reports which I have received from members Of my Advisory-Council, regarding the trade position and prospects.There is still an appreciable hold up in the steel-using industries owing to inability to obtain material. Sir Adam Nimmo&apos;s account of the general good fellowship in the coal mines is not borne out by independent reports from South Wales.The report of the woollen and worsted trade is better than I have had for some time.The figures given by Sir W. Clare Lees of the relative decline of cotton exports of European countries and thegreat Increase in Japanese exports are very interesting.-P .C . *L.Board of Trade,14th February, 1927.

COAL.SIR ADAM NIMMO thought thet we must be gratified, now that the coal stoppage was over, with the settlement that had taken place, and with the general results which had followed upon local settlements.     He had mentioned in a written report to the Advisory Council that in all the districts either provisional agreements or final agreements had bean entered into.      It ought also to be mentioned that the atmosphere in which these&apos; agreements had been entered into had been very good,       Sir A. Nimmo did not think that any importance should be attached to the statements that had been made that the industry was settling down in a sullen discontented spirit.      He did not believe there   was any evidence of that. It was remarkable that the output for the week ending 15th January last had been 98.3 per cent of the average weekly output in ilarch last.     There seemed to be no reason to anticipate that the output would not steadily grow, provided of course, we could find markets for our production.     At the moment, however, and during the first two months after the stoppage in particular, we had b en very much handicapped, necessarily, by the foreign coal that was still coming in.Another satisfactory feature^was that the output per person employed had gone up by 11? per cent.     That, of course, was bound to make for greater efficiency and lower costs of production, and would certainly improve the competitive position of the industry in the foreign market, and ultimately enable it to provide coal for the other industries of this country on more satisfactory terms.     The coal industry had learnt to take the broad view that their interests were the same as other peoplefs; we were all bound up in one bundle, and coalowners knew by experience that unless they could make conditions in respect of coal satisfactory to the other Industries of the country, they could not hope to prosper themselves.     Their whole attitude in the difficulties through which the country had passed, had been to try to make for a position r.hich would enable the other industries to get on to a thoroughly sou^d competitive basis, believing that as those industries were abla to spread their production the benefit would undoubtedly react on the coal interests.The crux of the position,  of course, lay in our ability to get back our export trade.       The figures were growing. The shipments of coal (including bunkers for the foreign trade) for the week ending 22nd January last amounted to 1,215,615 tons, as against 1,344,795 tons irhich was the weekly average for inarch, 1926.     There was no doubt that the collieries were in a better position now than they had been for many years to force the pace against such foreign competition as the British coal industry had to meet,  and if the industry were given a fighting chance, it would rehabilitate itself and get on to a satisfactory basis.
IRON AND STEEL.MR.- DOEMAN wrote:-&quot;The number of Blast Furnaces in operation at the end of December was 78, compared with 147 in blast at the end of April 1926.&quot;The production of pig iron in December 1926 amounted to 96,000 tons, compared with 12,700 tons in November, 539,100 tons in April,  and 503,400 tons in December 1925.&quot;The total pig iron output for 1926 was 2,441,500 tons as compared with 6,261,700 tons in 1925.&quot;The production of Steel Ingots in December 1926 amounted to 319,300 tons,  oompared with 97,500 tons in November, and 661,000 tons in April.&quot;There were produced 3,560,000 tons of steel in 1926 as compared with 7,385,400 tons in 1925.&quot;The Imports of Iron and Steel during December 1926 amounted to 517,000 tons compared with 249,514 tons in December 1925, and the Exports amounted to 158,700 tons, compared with 340,825 tons in December 1925.&quot;There is little change in the Iron position from last month,  except that more Blast Furnaces have been re-lit. There is still a general shortage of pig iron, for steelworks are taking the bulk of the iron produced, and their demands are such that there is little prospect of any diminution of their requirements for some time.    Prices in consequence are firm. Coke is still scarce, but the tendency appears on the whole to be a little easier,  and average qualities can be bought in the region of 25/- per ton delivered at works.&quot;So far as manufactured steel is concerned, all works are actively employed on full order books,  although the volume of new business has fallen off, owing no doubt to the extreme difficulty in obtaining prompt deliveries.&quot;Shipbuilding is still improving,  a few more boats having been placed during the past month.&quot;The condition of the Galvanised and Black Sheet Trade is quiet,  the demand being poor,  and all Galvanisers are requiring work.&quot;The Wire Trade is not in a satisfactory state, orders being diffioult to obtain, particularly for Soft Wire both for Home and Export.    Ropemaking, however, Is a little improved, which has resulted in a slightly Increased demand for Hard Wire.    The position is viewed uith apprehension by Wire Manufacturers generally.
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).&quot;Constructional Engineers, now that the Rolling.. Mills are getting away, are being able to return to more normal conditions, but difficulties are still being experienced in obtaining supplies of steel,  and this is likely to continue for some little time.    Enquiries for new business are being reoeived and orders are being placed.   Prices are a little harder,  and this branch of the industry may be described as slightly Improved.    The price of Continent billets and sheet bars is  5.0.0 per ton c.i.f. North East Coast Ports.&quot;There has been no development at all with regard to the European steel Pact during the month&quot;.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that in Sheffield the orders coming in were rather better in volume and number than hitherto. In the home trade the orders were reasonably good,    It was difficult to judge of the future because deliveries of steel had been so bad, and still were so bad that new orders were being delayed.    If the Sheffield firms could clear.off some of the orders they had on hand,  they could get in better orders.    The steel makers, however, were naturally making first   -:&apos; all the steel they could make in bulk.    That was hitting the Sheffield firms,  the bulk of whose trade was in special kinds of steel.Orders were still ooming from China, and money was being paid from China.    There was a very strong feeling in Shanghai, which amounted to almost a certainty, that within a few days, or certainly weeks,  they would be faced with the same situation as had occurred at Hankow.    This was having a very unsettling effect, but meantime the Chinese trade was extraordinarily active.    The Japanese trade had fallen off considerably; Canadian, Australian, South African and New Zealand orders were all good.    The whole of the European trade was diffiou.lt.    We had loot a great deal of it through the variations and instability of currency, and it would take a very long time if we were ever to regain the trade that had been done with European countries.NON-FERROUS METALS.THE BRITISH METAL CORPORATION,  on behalf of SIR CECIL BUDD, wrote:-&quot;The first month of the New Year has not been particularly propitious,  and prices of non-ferrous metals have shown considerable falls,  except in the case of Tin, which is barely steady.      In the case of Spelter and
NON-FERROUS METALS (OONTD.)Copper, there is at the present time considerable over-production, which has coincided with a falling off in the demand for metals in America and also with a quiet season in this country.    France too has been unwilling to ,buy, but Germany has shown signs of improved consumption in both Zinc and Copper.      It is now thought that markets have probably bottomeo., and from most centres we hear that consumers of non-ferrous metals are looking to the future with more confidence&quot;.ENGINEERING.MR. BROW&amp;LIE recalled the observations he had made at the Council&apos;s previous meeting in regard to unemployment, so far as membership of the Amalgamated Engineering Union wa3 concerned, and observed that the latest published returns showed that between the month of November and the end of December those unemployment figures had dropped by 3,673.    There was reason to believe tiiat those figures would have become still more favourable during January, and a greater number of unemployed persons would have found employment the number of people-in the engineering industry reported as unemployed at 22nd November 1926 had been 167,922$    by 20th December last the number had dropped to 143,503 - a decrease of 24,419*.    At the last meeting he had mentioned that a number of pattern makers had recently become employed.    That continued, and pattern makers were still finding employment, and were being sought for in various establisnments.as regards the towns where the men of the Amalgamated Engineering Union were working, in London about 90 additional members found, employment during December, as compared with November.    In Manchester the additional number amounted to 112.    On the other hand, there had been a decrease in Glasgow and on the lyne of 57 and 94, respectively.    Liverpool showed an increase of 41, Sheffield of 106, and Coventry of 60; but there was a decrease in the figures of those employed in Oldham,  of 40.    Those were taken from the ten principal centres.Mr.  Erownlie&apos;s information went to show that there was likely to be a decline in the demand for textile machinery,which would result in an increase in the unemployment figures,but with reference to engineering on the marine side, therewere indications that there would bo a revival of trade.&quot;-Since the meeting, the January figures have become available, and are as follows:-Total unemployed members of the A.E.U....... 21,527Decrease since December .....,........ 5,158Total unemployed in the engineering industry at 24th January............. 130,909uecrease since December  .............. 12,594
COTTON,SIR W. CLARS LE3S thought that the position in Manchester was distinctly better than it had been a month ago. Undoubtedly many more orders had been placed, and they were very widespread. India had bought quite well;   China had done a little, but- of course the situation there was very difficult;    Java and the Dutch Colonies generally had done very well;   the feeling in the Mediterranean Ports was better, and although they had not begun seriously to buy, stocks were getting to safer levels;    South America was not doing very much, nor was the west coast of Africa, as yet.    The home trade was better;    and although there was nothing approaching full occupation for our spinning and weaving machinery, because the basic grey export trade was still very largely lacking, never-theless in the other sections of the trade, the fine sections and finishing sect,Ions, etc*,  the prospects of improvement were quite pronounced and would probably be felt quite quickly.Sir William had been looking up some figures relating to European and other countries in regard to trade in cotton piece goods.       He thought that     from what one read and heard th3 general impression gained was that the whole of Europe had been going ahead   at a great pace while we had been going back at. a great pace, but these statistics hardly justified that conclusion.    The figures for the whole year 1926 were not in all cases available and, where necessary, had been estimated on the basis of the figures for the months of 1925 that were availableIn handing the figures in (they are reproduced at the end of these Notes), Sir W* Clare Lees explained that the figures for European countries were expressed in hundreds of kilogs. He thought that on the whole, 100 kilogs might be taken as roughly equal to 1,000 yards, though this equation would yield a figure considerably too low in the case of countries exporting lighter goods, such as Switzerland,  and a good deal too high in the case of the countries, e.g., Italy, which   exported heavier goods.The general picture showed clearly that, whilst Europe had not suffered so severely as we had in this country, at any rate European countries, other than Belgium and France, had experienced a diminution of external trade in cotton piece goods just as we had, and from these figures it seemed obvious that the reason why their loss was so much less than ours was to be found entirely in the Japanese and Indian figures. If one took the increased exports of Japanese piece goods and the Increased production internally of Indian piece goods, goods produced and consumed Inside India, and put them together, they would be found to account for the difference between our position and the European position.    In Sir Will lam&apos;s view,  Europe as a whole did not 3tand to lose as against Japan and India to any appreciable extent, and it was ourselves who had suffered most of the detriment that had arisen from that increased production. Although it might be the case that large quantities of the Japanese goods and most of the Indian goods were not competitive,  in the strictest sense of the word,  with our productions,  it was
d ,j */COTTON (C ONTD ).nevertheless quite clear that if their productive capacity had not been increased, the general demand would have been supplied by Lancashire instead of by them.   And whereas one constantly heard suggestions for appointing Committees of Investigation, Royal Commissions and so forth,  it looked as if the whole explanation of our great difficulties in loss of export trade In piece goods was to be found In these figures, and that the problem was an Asiatic problem. It should be added that the British loss in 1926 as compared with 1925 was 13k%t and as compared with 1913 it was but thefigure for 1926 was not a very fair one to take because of our own disturbances.    Accordingly, if one made the comparison on the 1925 figures, as being more normal, that 43s^ would become 343$ as being the British loss compared with 1913,MR. LI IT) SAY thought that there was often a tendency to overlook one very Important point in the cotton situation,  -namely, the growing importance of the Indian crop.   All through those post-war years when the American crop was short, the Indian crop was increasing. The Indian cotton crop used to be about 4 million bales per annum before the war;    after the war it rose to 5 million bales, and   last year it was 6 million bales.   Not only so, but the proportion of the long staple Indian cotton was increasing and of the short staple declining.    The curve of American cotton prices after the war went up as the crop became short, and fell again in 1926. It went up to about 31d.    as the top point, and down to as low as 6d., while to-day it was about 7sd.    The Indian crop followed the general line of the American curve but did not rise so far.    That&apos; is to say,  the margin of price in favour of Indian cotton increased the higher American cotton went. That appeared to explain what Sir W. Clare Lees had said in regard to the advantage which the East was having;   because Japan and India were both using Indian cotton in great quantities.    The Continent had always used a certain amount of Indian cotton, but had not enlarged its purchases very much. Japan, however, had increased her&apos;s from 1 million bales pre-war to 2 million bales now;    the Continent used just over 1 million bales, China now took half-a-million.The reason for the request of the Bombay mills for an enquiry, and the well-known depression in   Bombay, was probably to be found largely in the fact that the fall of the American crop price last year had been greater than the fall of the Indian price.    Speaking very approximately, American cotton used to be perhaps 2d. above the Indian before the war.   The price then went up   to very considerable heights above the Indian,  - in the neighbourhood of 4d -while to-day it was about *d. above the Indian price. Bombay therefore could not maintain her sales, because American cotton and the finer piece goods were  at last coming back to popularity in India, and Bombay was feeling the effects.-g mm
kj j xCOTTON (CONTD)This depression was not universal In the Indian cotton trade; the up-country mills had been able to carry on owing to their distance from the ports;   they had a protection against over-seas competition in the fact that railway rates did not figure so largely in their marketing costs.    It must not be forgotten of course that the American crop was at one time in the neighbourhood of 8., 000,000 bales per annum, and then in successive years it went up to 10, 11, 14, 16 and 18 millions, contrasted with the Indian, whioh was the next biggest crop, of 4,  5 and 6 million bales,, The Indian crop was quite an important factor nowadays in the general cotton price position.WOOL.MR. ANDREWS reported that during the last two months the demand for wool all over the world had been growing. It was found most pronounced from Germany and Japan, There was a less, but a growing, demand both from this country and from the United States.   The French woollen industry had had a set back in October on account of the franc disturbance, and had been very quiet since then; but now they were beginning to show signs of recovery, so that with an increased demand throughout the world prices had advanced by something like 10%,   As to our own traders, the impossibility of our being able to obtain a profit had rather prevented us from obtaining our usual share of the wool.    The sales Were drawing towards a close, and it looked as if we might possibly be landed with not; quite sufficient wool to see us through. If wq were to get our usual quantity, we should   have to buy pretty freely in the next two or three months. It was extraordinary how the export trade in Germany had improved since October, when the French first got into trouble;   but there was also no doubt whatever that we ourselves were In a little better position than formerly.Prospects for the future were much brighter than they had been a few months ago in the spinning, the weaving, and the manufacturing alike. It would, no doubt, be rather a long time before our trade got back to normal.    It had a bi&apos;* leeway to make up, and the purchasing power of our people was probably not going to be normal for some time to come. But in the market for tops and yarns there was recently almost as much as a 5$ advance;    and the yarn that was being produced now was occupying quite 80$ of the total number of spindles, as against the 60^6 employed a little while ago;    and,  further, the yarn was being sold about as fast as it was produced. Stocks generally were being got rid of as soon as they were made, but the trouble was that at this time of the year the trade ought to be accumulating quite a lot of wool, whereas in fact they had no encouragement to buy it.    The result was that they might have to suffer a shortage of wool.   However,  after the French dropped out in October, the price dropped 10^, and   the supplies obtained by this country were got at the reduced price, and as regards prices there was nobody better situated than ourselves.In weaving, output had gone down at one time to 50:3 of capacity;    it was now at 60/  or over.
QjEMIOALS^MR. PERRY wrote:-&quot;Comparison of December 1926 and 1925 trade returns results in observations similar to those which have been made on October and November statisticsj and the chief Interest at present lies, therefore, in the figures available for the full year.    The total annual figures for 1926 are naturally heavily affected by the strike, but for which, it is reasonable to assume that the downward tencency in exports would not have been present, even if no increase had been shown.    Exports of chemicals, drugs, dyes and colours amounted to  21,638,5-14 as compared with  23,625,202 in 1925 and  25,478,373 in 1924.    The relationship remains approximately the same if we except drugs, dyestuffs and colours, the first and last of which have consistently improved during the last three years,  so far as export trade is concerned.    Other items which may be noted ares- the increase in exports, in 1926 as compared with 1925, of tartaric acid, bleaching powder,  glycerine and miscellaneous coal tar products, as well as the increased exports of benzole and toluole and naphtha in 1926 compared with 1925, though these last are    still below the 1924 f!guro3u    The ammonium sulphate situation has remained as expected; the value of exports to France  ( 13) during 1926, when comoared with  391,970 in 1924 and  88... 966 in 1925, points to a*market at least temporarily lost.    Exjjorts to Spain and Italy are only about one-third of those during 1925, while tho trades with the Dutch East Indies, British West India Islands and Japan are substantially reduced.&quot;Finally, the downward tendency of chemical imports during 1925 has been reversed to an increase from  1*1,388,493 to  15,445,896.      The review of the year Indicates a reduction of some  2,700,000 in the value of artificial silk yarn imports, in spite of the increased imports of recent months; appreciable reductions have also been made in imports of tartaric acid and tartrates, borax, calcium carbide, sodium nitrate and intermediate coal tar products, while there were substantial increases over 1925 in tho case of coal tar products, other than intermediates, etc., acetic acid, lead oxides, potassium salts and dyestuffs other than synthetic indigo and alizarine.&quot;Generally speaking, the chemical industry has weathered the coal strike remarkably well; and, given lower freights and reasonable prices for fuel, the prospects of this industry are undoubtedly good.&quot;POTTERY-MR. ROLLINS observed that there were indications in the Pottery trade that business was fairly good.    So far as the National Society of Pottery Workers was concerned,
POTTERY (OONTD. ) ,they were paying a much smaller amount in unemployment benefit than at this time last year, and the Unemployment Exchange figures were lower by 10fo than the corresponding figures for 1926.   The Board of Trade returns of the export trade were naturally, after the stoppage of last year, seriously affected.     How far the home trade had been affected, it. was difficult to say, but probably it was in approximately the same proportion.     As far as the present position was concerned, so long as the building trade remained good, tiles and similar materials would be in good demandj and it was understood that trade in electrical fittings was much better.    It was satisfactory to hear the favourable reports made to the Council respecting the iron and steel and shipbuilding trades last month, because their revival would stimulate the various branches of the pottery trade.     It was still rather early to indicate fully what the effects of the new trade position would be, but the prospects were very promising.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON wrote:-&quot;The Rubber Industry, which ho.d maintained its production to a surprising extent during the Strike, has since found business to be rather on a reduced soale. Tho Tyre soction of the Trade is going through a very bad period owing to a tyre price war which is now in progress.    This war, which was initiated by a foreign manufacturing concern lowering prices to a quite unjustified extent, appears to be a transfer of hostilities from foreign markets to this country.   The fight has been going on in various foreign areas between huge American and Continental concerns and it has now been transferred into Great Britain, due presumably to the fact that the British is now practically the onl;*- unprotected tyre market in the World.    The tyre prices now in force are in most cases under the prime cost of materials and labour, and these prices are likely to be reflected in the Profit and Loss accounts of all tyre Manufacturing Companies for the coming year.11 In the Footwear branch of the Rubber Trade conditions are also unsatisfactory, due to unseasonable weather. The fine weather of December, which is the best month of the year for the sale of Rubber Boots, Overshoes, etc. has left both Manufacturers and Wholesalers with large stocks of goods on hand, and unfortunately these conditions have also applied to almost all foreign countries, with the result that stocks exported abroad are also still unsold, a consequent bad effect on next season&apos;s business.
RUBBER (CONTD.)&quot;The uncertainty of the raw rubber market is also causing buyers to hang off purchasing manufactured goods in the expectation of a lower level of prices if raw rubber falls further.&quot;Generally speaking, the ordinary business, which had been surprisingly well maintained under adverse conditions, is indeed very disappointing, just at a time when it was expected that conditions would be improving.11FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR STANLEY MACHIN was glad to be able to report a brighter outlook than had been noticeable for some time past. In the food trades especially, stocks had been reduced; and manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and the big retail distributors, were all anticipating brighter times.   Buyers were displaying more confidence,  and, provided that we escaped serious industrial troubles, the year&apos;s outlook seemed very hopeful.   The export trade at this season of the year was not a matter of great importance, but it was gratifying to see that this was holding Its own.    In India our food industries were showing signs of increase, and also in Other parts of the Dominions.    Strangely enough, in China trade was still going on, practically uninterruptedly.    On the Continent trade was very unsatisfactory; little or nothing was being done, but it was cheering to see that during the last few months enquiries had been coming from Germany which had not reached us since the outbreak of the war.    Sir Stanley had been in France a few days before.    They did not appear to be very happy as to their present outlook, and unemployment was increasing.    If, however, the franc were stabilised In the neighbourhood of 120, it was to be hoped that we on tais side might again be able to cultivate a trade which we used to do in substantial quantities before the war.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR. G ALIA CHER stated that, On the whole, sales in the New Year had shown a very slight increase - just touching - over the corresponding period last year.    That was quite satisfactory because the period a year ago was a very good one.   All the departments showed a slight increase except the drapery,  vhich had continually shown losses week after week.     That, of course, was to be expected, because drapery was to some extent a luxury trade, and was the
SCOTTISH CO-OPERATD/E WHOLESALE SOCIETY (CONTD.)last to recover.    It was to be remembered that at the moment the rates and taxes in Scotland were exceedingly heavy,  and these were really taking up any little surplus money that people might have.   All the Local Authorities, County Councils, and others, were spending a great deal,  and never were the rates so far behind.    In Mr. Gallacher&apos;s own County the rates were slightly over 20/- in the  .    These were, of course, the rates that fel2* both on the occupier and owner, and they did not include any portion of the burdens which had been put upon the ratepayers In respect of the miners&apos; .stoppage.    These burdens had not yet been allocated, because they were held to be illegal,   and were now in suspense; but there could be no question that the economic life of the people at the moment was very much stressed and bothered. However, they were hopeful that In the  course of a few months things would be better.in the last half-year of 1926 it was found that in the textile branches the Society had done badly;    they had a mill which turned out some very fine Scotch tweeds, but their people did not seem able to buy the finest Scotch tweeds.   There was a decrease in purchasing power,  and every-where people were buying a lower quality of material.   The same applied to the jute industry; they had a large jute mill in Dundee which was  showing a loss.   But the flour mills were showing a considerable profit, in spite of a fact which might be expected to militate against it.    The Wholesale Society had agreed to send the flour carriage free to the various Retail Societies;    it might cost o/- or   4/- per sack to take it to a given place, and ,4/- was more  than the wholesale and retail profit put together.      On soap they had always made large profits; and ever since the formation of the Soap Combine they had found no difficulty in making huge profits on soap.    The Wholesale Society found itself in the happy position of being able to pay the usual dividend despite the very bad tames. That was due largely - 50% of it Indeed - to the fact that they had had a concession from the Flour Mills Control in the shape of deferred profits.GENERAL TRADE.SIR MAX MUSPRATT regarded the general trade position as being one of considerable perplexity.    There were distinct signs of increased activity,  and even optimistic hopes that something approaching a minor boom might soon take effect, but there were also so many doubtful factors that it was very difficult to make any prophecy.    The possibility of Increased taxation was a serious factor, and what psychological effect it would have on industry it was too soon to say.    There is no question, however, that rates would be bound to go up considerably, and they were such a heavy expense in many industries that any increase might very seriously handicap-1.1-
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)our competition in overseas markets.   The coal stoppage and all that happened during that period had brought out in great prominence a tendency which had been showing itself even before, and that was the distinct growth in importance of our home trade as compared with our export trade.    The way the home trade had kept up and. was increasing, was marvellous. Turning, for instance, to the nation&apos;s expenditure last Christmas, which was extraordinarily good, considering that it came at the end of the long coal stoppage, a number of problems presented themselves which all concerned in trade needed to study both with regard to their own particular industry and industry as a whole, in order to discover what the balance between home trade and export trade was croing to be in the future.    As far as our export trade, and also the competition we met with from abroad, were concerned, the further stabilisation of the coinages was a very satisfactory factor; and if only France could make up her mind to stabilise, Italy would, no doubt, Immediately follow, and then we should really get into a comparatively favourable condition in which we could determine what branches of our export trade could be maintained and increased, and also what measure of stability our home trade was likely to have.The President remarked that Sir Max Muspratt&apos;s observations were borne out by our trade figures for 1926.    While exports of manufactures (coal, of course, being not in that category) were lower than in 1925 by something like  78,000,000 - some part of the diminution was due to a drop in prices, - the decrease in our imports of manufactures was only about  4,000,000,    There was a diminution of internal purchasing power no doubt, and people bought less; but we must have kept a good hold on the home market, otherwise there would have been larger imports.MR. V^tLE reported that optimism still persisted in industry, although perhaps evidence to justify it was rather slow in presenting itself.    In the south west of Ensland there was a decrease in the unemployment figures, and those who were unemployed were   mostly unskilled people for whom it was very difficult to find work except at seasonal times. On the east coast there was still a feeling of optimism, but without much evidence of increasing trade.    At Hull the seed-crushing trade reported improvements both in home and export orders.    The fruit trade coming in through the Humber promised to be light, as the Spanish orange crops had been injured by a severe frost.    It was reported that the Spanish Government had adopted a rigorous inspection of all the oranges for export, and were only passing the good fruit.    The fish landed at Hull during 1926 was less than in the previous year,  and the trade were complaining of ever-increasing quantities of foreign fish brought to this country.    However,  they had placed orders for 5 new trawlers, which showed their confidence in the trade in the future.
OONtf&apos; LDENTIAL.GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)In the Midlands business was quiet, and despite an optimistic outlook, the results were somewhat disappointing. In Engineering the foundries were slack and badly in need oi&quot; orders, but machine tool departments were showing an improvement;    lifting gear and   transport vehicles were being turned out fairly rapidly.    Tho effects of the coal stoppage had been disastrous in many cases.    Some large companies there, employing a very large amount of capital, were returning a profit of only a few thousands. The motor trade was the mainstay of the district,  and extensions were in progress in the works of several of the large motor firms there.    Builders&apos; hardware was in very fair demand,  but other-   hardware was depressed.    Some of it, of course, was seasonal.    The heavier trades were finding the shortage of  iron and steel a groat handicap, although they admitted this to be a passing phase.    The expected improvement in the demand for timber of all kinds had not been generally realised,  but there were indications that in a short time there would be a good demand.    The demand for all classes of  leather was slow, but prices were remaining fairly firm.    The leading feature in the trade was that the world price of hides was keeping at a higher level than the English tanner could reach.    These high prices for hides were being paid by America, Germany, Russia and Scandinavia;  it was reported,  indeed,  that Russia had been a very large buyer of hides.Mr. Vyle observed that Sir Stanley Machin had referred to the question of the franc.  (See &quot;Food Industries&quot;  section). He, Mr. Vyle, had had an opportunity in France of conversing with some industrialists there regarding the franc, and the opinion expressed to him was that if the franc were stabilised round about 120,  its present point,  it would probably become permanently settled;    but political interests were, for some reason or other, making a great effort to push the franc up&quot;&quot; to 100.    It seemed to be the general feeling that this attempt would fail, and if  it did so, we would see a tremendous fluctuation in the value of the franc, to the. great detriment of everyone concerned.SIR SlANLEi MACHIN said that, looking at the matter from the traders&apos;  point of view, he could not identify himself with all that Mr. McKenna had said recently at the Midland Bank meeting.    We had not got an abundance of capital, and we knew that large sums of money had been sent to other countries for profitable employment.      That might be well enough in times of trade depression in this country, when capital could not be fully employed here; but when we came to a revival in trade, which we all hoped for and looked forward to,  increased capital in substantial quantities must be wanted, and unless a certain amount of elasticity was provided,  so that we could attract that money back to this country, - and the only way in which to do so seemed to be by a high Bank Rate, which was a very serious prospect to contemplate - there was opened up a possibility of a position
GENERAL TRADE (OONTD.)which might seriously handicap the development which we had reason to anticipate. Sir S. Machin repeated that he did not identify himself either with Mr. Goodenough or Mr. McKenna, but he thought It would be very interesting to have, if we could, some light thrown on this very important subject, and the differences between these two high experts cleared up.Mr. Andrews observed that Sir Stanley Maohin had mentioned a point which was interesting tho West Riding very much, namely the differenoe between the speeohes of Mr. Goodenough and Mr. McKenna.   There was no doubt that traders ought to have increased facilities.    A good many very large traders in Bradford had    said that they did not know how they were going to finanoe the Increase in trade that they could see coming along.The President remarked that this matter had been discussed at one or two of the recent Council meetings, and there seemed to be a general oonsensue of opinion among the Bankers that it was necessary to divide trade requirements into two categories j firstly, the carrying on of people who oould not reasonably expeot to make a profit and secondly, the carrying of new business which was sound but could not show a return for Beveral months, during which time, however, materials and labour had to be paid for.   Where firms were on a sound basis undoubtedly they had to have their requirements met.    It would be useful to discuss this again when Sir tfelix Schuster and other Bankers were present.    Meanwhile, one thing had to be remembered, to which Mr. McKenna drew attention in his speech;    it was necessary to be very careful that output kept pace with the oreation of credit.   Recent American figures had shown the inoreased efficiency of production in America, which appeared to be very remarkable. It came roughly to this, that there had been sinoe 1919 a 50fo increase In output per man.   That had been due partly to the actual increase in output by the man, partly to increased factory effioiency.   Taking the production figure as 100 in 1919, in 192.6 it was 128, and taking factory employment in 1919 as 100 also, in 1926 it was 85, and at the same time wages were rising steadily.    If those two factors were taken together, part being directly attributable to the output of the man and part directly attributable to the increased efficiency of the factory, one got a net inorease of about 50$.    Only if an increase in output could be assured, is it possible to effect an increase in the currency, with the knowledge that the rate of increase of goods would be greater than the rate of increase of money.Sir Stanley Machin suggested that an increased output was largely the result of an Increased demand.    If we had an increased demand in this country, it would be possible to attain an enormously increased output, as we knew from our experience during the war.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD).Sir Arthur Balfour observed that on the point of Christmas expenditure, he had been told by big Stores, both in London and rhe provinces,  that they had never had so many people through   their Stores before, but that the total result was not so good, and the amount spent per head was less than at Christmas, 1925.Referring to Mr, I;!cKennars speech, Sir Arthur Bslfour thought it would be highly detrimental to industry in this country if amalgamation of the currencies was postponed for any long while0     He considered that the time was ripe for this amalgamation, and anything that would postpone it for one, two or three years, while an investigation was being made into the advisability of altering the Bank Act,  or the basis on which it should be altered, would be most injurious to the trades of the country.     Of course it was a very controversial question on which Mr. McKenna had spoken, but we had a totally different situation here from that which they had in America.     We had to buy our food from abroad, they had It in their own country.      They had an enormous home market which we did not have; and last, but not least, there had been a will to work in America which we had not had in this country.      when we got it we should be able to compete with the world, but until we did, we should not be able to do so.     Unless we set to work to increase our production,  it was certain that we would have a prolonged period of disaster and re-adjnstment to go through.SHIPPING,MR. ALEXANLliR SHAW thought that there was no particular development to be recorded with regard to shipping matters generally.      It would be seen from the figures in the data before the Council that the total tonnage of vessels laid up in British ports remained practically stationary during the last quarter, and, as might have been expected, freights had gone back in December.       The Annual Report of the Chamber of Shipping, &apos; hi h was to be issued in a few days, would show that, taking   the year 1926 as a whole, few, if any, of the tramp owners had made any money^ and the same applied to the Liners also.      It might be well that the Report should be sent by the Chamber to each member of the Advisory Council.      It must be remembered that during the coal stoppage, certain very important factors had to be set against the rise in freights that occurred.      It was a case of one-way cargoes then, coal for burning was more expensive, and there was a general dislocation of shipping.     &apos;we had not even yet qu.,te settled down to normal conditions.     Further,  in the early part of 1926 costs had been 75 to 100.i above pre-war scale; and, taking the year as a whole, there had been little,  if any, margin of profit.     With regard to the charter in the Australian
SHIPrING (CONTD).trade which had been referred to, that was now completely settled, and settled with goodwill on both sides.     The course which had been followed with regard to other charters had been followed here.     As time went on these charters would be more and more welcome to everybody concerned, and they were finding it a great advantage to have some standard document of that kind.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB said that the latest detailed figures for traffic were for November and these had now&apos; lost interest. As regards receipts, in the first three weeks of the year -that was up to the 23rd January,  - the passenger receipts of the four railway groups had been  180,000 less than last year, and the goods receipts  67,000 more, making a net decrease of  113,000.      It was perhaps a little early to draw any definite inference from these figures, but the passenger traffic was obviously less buoyant than it had been a year ago.Sir Adam Nimmo regarded it as particularly unfortunate that at this juncture the railway rates should be increased. He was not suggesting that railway companies had not a very strong case for increasing their rates, but at the same time an increase would be one of the worst things that could happen in connection with the expansion of trade that we were hoping for.      It was bound to lessen our po&apos; er of competition, and if anything could be done to hold back that Increase in rates so as to give Industry a chance of meeting the expanding opportunities which appeared to be in front of them,  it might be^the very best thing from the point of view of the country as a whole.      If an expansion in industry and trade took place, the advantages that would accrue to the railway companies might be expected to compensate them for foregoing the higher rates.3M?LCYl.k;NT,MR. PHILLIPS observed that the course of the unemployment figures since January had been fairly encouraging.     There had been the seasonal increase in numbers over Christmas, amounting to the unusually high total of 186,000.      In the three wee .:s ending the 24th January, hoy/ever, there had followed a recovery of 147,000 out of that total.      This was rather more favourable actually than appeared on the surface, because the number of registered coal miners was continuously increasing over the period, as they became qualified for unemployment benefit after the dispute.   A year ago the Christmas increase had been 149,000, and the
EMPLOYMENT (CONTD).recovery up to the 25th January was only 51,000; but the total was then lower by about 150,000 then this year, and the more rapid recovery this year might have been only a consequence of the inflated figure from which it started.It should be observed that the unemployment figure on January 24th, - 1,348,000 - was still very high.   Excluding the period of the coal mining dispute there had been a slightly higher figure for one week in August,1925, but apart from that isolated case we had to go back as far as February, 1923, to find a total as high as the present one.     Another disquieting feature was the number quoted as  &quot;wholly unemployed&quot; - 969,000 on the 24th January, - a figure considerably larger than anything reached during the Coal Dispute.The latest figures we had for coal miners registered as unemployed was 125,000 for 20th December.     The corresponding figure for the end of January was not yet ascertained, but it would probably be between 160,000 and 190,000.      The increase would,  of course, be due in the main to miners ceasing to be disqualified for benefit, and would not be an actual addition to the numbers unemployed.Sir Adam NImmo was sorry to hear the figures suggested in regard to unemployment in coal mining In the near future. He took them with a great deal of reserve, because he thought that the problem of unemployment in collieries was not going to be so great as was anticipated.     He had always held the view personally that the figures of unemployment were much exaggerated, and perhaps Included many men who were not employable at all.       In the present case he thought we were going to absorb a further considerable body of men who had been accustomed to work at the collieries, and he did not feel confident     that the figure which had been mentioned, of 160 odd thousand men expected to be out of work in coal mining, would stand close examination.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON reported that the Australian wool season was just coming to an and, and the harvests were practically completed.   The results for January had been very satisfactory, except in Queensland, and the shipping difficulties had been got over
AUS TR ALIANTR AD 3 (CONTD ) .The next two or three months were an anxious time of year. With regard to grain, the Northern and other parts of the Continent had been subject to monsoon rains; but this had not been the case In the central and western portions   of Queensland.. Further south,  in New South Wales and Victoria, the rains were generally expected about March or April, and the prospects of agriculture and pasture In the futurs were likely to continue goods    If they did not come,  the numbers of the livestock, particularly in New South Wales, would cause some apprehension, and it remained to be seen how far they could be absorbed;,INDIAN TRADE,  see also the &quot;Cotton&quot;section).MR. LINDSAY said that the Indian trade accounts for the calendar year 1926 had been received, and these showed a certain decline In exports accompanied by a jllght rise in importso    It looked as if the long series of years during which India&apos;s exports were Increasing and her imports were remaining steady had come to an end. In 1921 there had been an adverse balance of 47 crores, That was changed in 1922 to a favourable balance of 11, In 1923 there was a favourable balance of 54, in 1924 of 80,  and in 1925 of 100 crores. That dropped in 1926 to one of 55 crores;    and it was probable that the favourable balance of trade throughout was due to the fact that the internal price level In India was considerably lower than the general world price level.    It would be a little difficult to prove that, but It seemed to be the explanation of Indiala exports having sold so well in the world!s markets, and of her imports showing no such expansion. That raised the question of inflation. India&apos;3 note circulation was 100 crores in 1917-1918,and by August 1926,  It was 200 crores. By 31st December, 1926, it was down to 181 crores. That was a drop of nearly \0% in the circulating note issue in four months. It was the price of American cotton which had affected Indiafs export position so materially.    In one Item only,  - raw cotton,  - her exports had dropped from 105 crores in value.&quot;In 1925, to 72 crores in 1926,  - a loss of 33 croras in a single year.On the import side,  this fall in price had had the reverse effect;    itrhad stimulated demand, and the.increase of trade had exactly mads up the loss of price; that is to say, India1s Imports in 1925 of cotton piece goods from all sources amounted to 58 crores of rupees, and in 1926 they were the same, 58 crores. Thus in spite of a fall in the price of American cotton from 10d. in January, 1926, to 6d. at the end of last year, the value of India&apos;s total Import trade In cotton piece&apos; goods was maintained,  showing that the volume had considerably advanoed. In Iron and Steel India&apos;s
0 p 1o &apos;J i)INDIAN TRADE (OONTD.).purchases had gone up considerably from 1925 to 1926; and it was the same with sugar.    So that this price fall in 1926 had had the effect of discouraging Indian exports and stimulating the imports, and thereby leading to a more normal balance of trade.In connexion with the Indian Tariff Board1s Report on Iron and Steel, it would be remembered that the question of Imperial Preference had been left by the Fiscal Commission to the considered opinion of the Indian Legislature, and it had never been directly put to the Indian Tariff Board as an issue on which a decision was wanted.   That Board, which had now decided on a lower rate of duty on British than on Continental steel, was one consisting entirely of Indians, and It had come to a decision on a strictly logical considera-tlon of the facts.    The Board knew that Indian steel could not compete on level terms if it received such an amount of protection as would place its price half way between British and Continental prices,    The British and Continental steels, had, therefore, to be separated and treated differently, thus securing conditions under which the three classes, Indian, Oontinental, and British, would have absolute equality of treatment in the Indian markets. Those were the reasons which underlay the suggestion that there should be a basic duty on all steel imports, plus an additional duty on non-British steel.    It still remained to be seen what line the Select Committee would take on this recommendation, and what line the Legislature would take.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE wrote&quot;In Argentina, trade conditions in all import markets are reported to be slowly Improving.    The general outlook is also brighter, owing chiefly to the fact that excellent crops of wheat, oats and linseed are assured, while prospects for maize are exceptionally good. The chief adverse circumstance is the generally low level of prices for Argentine agricultural products.   Local interests are reported to be agitating against the action of certain countries, including the United States, in restricting imports of Argentine meat.   The official returns of the export trade of the Republic during the first eleven months of 1926 show that the total value was ^728,859,000  (gold), against ^809,396,000 in the corresponding period of 1925, although the volume Increased from 9,692,000 to 11,159,000 metric tons.    The corresponding statistics of Imports are not yet available, but the surplus of imports for the whole of 1926 has been estimated at between 20 and 30 million gold pesos, against 8,918,000 gold pesos in 1925.    The firm tendency in exchange during recent months may therefore be
9 n 1^ &apos;J &amp;attributed to the further consolidation of the national financial position,as well as to the favourable nature of the reports on the grain crops, and especially to the better quality and quantity of the wheat.   Argentina is steadily following the policy.of funding her short-term debt as opportunity offers,and, for this purpose, a further loan of  27,000,000 was floated in New York in mid-January in the form of 6 per cent. Bonds, redeemable by 1st February 1961. The price of issue was 98-J- per cent., the amount offered being quickly over-subscribed.&quot;There has recently been inoreased activity in tho market for Chilean nitrate of soda, large quantities of the fertiliser having been 30ld under the provisions of a new scheme approved by the Producers1 Association.   Under the scheme, the Association may effect sales of nitrate for delivery between 20th January and 31st May,  1927, up to a total of -300,000 metric tons, undor a guarantee to re-purchase 75 per cent, of stocks of such nitrate remaining unsold on 30th June next, subject to certain specified conditions.    On the basis of the new scheme, offers have been accepted for nitrate amounting in all to 254,203 metric tons, and total sales of the fertiliser for delivery during the current season now amount to 892,158 tons, against 1,603,498 tons a year ago.    In the meantime, however, the general commercial situation in the Republic continues dull, with no feature of outstanding importance to report.&quot;Details as to the precise intentions of the Brazilian Government in regard to the currency stabilisation scheme have not yet been made known.    It is reported, however, that a loan of some  20,000,000 sterling may be made an integral part of the stabilisation plan, but no particulars have yet been received as to the guarantee or terms likely to be offered.     The Federal trade returns for October last show that exports amounted in value to 304,479 contos of reis, while Imports totalled 254,130 contos.    The export surplus thus established of 70,049 contos Increases the favourable balance of trade for the first ten months of 1926 to 380,479 contos.    The Information received from Sao Paulo indicated that a welcome decline has occurred in the liabilities recorded in commercial failures.      In fact, none of any great importance have occurred for some time.    The higher prices registered for certain of &quot;the export commodities,  especially coffee, have stimulated trading activity.    There is a seasonal dulness in some import lines, but a generally improved tone is prevalent,.&quot;Business conditions in Mexico remain vory depressed, the application of the controversial religious laws and of the legal restrictions on the operations of the petroleum companies, as well as the strained relations with the United States, combining to impart a feeling of uncertainty as to the immediate future.    Considerable unemployment Is reported in the oil-fields, and will probably continue until the rights of the companies under the new laws have been more clearly defined.&quot;

Since this Table was handed in,  the Board of Trade have been able to secure figures covering the whole year 1926 for five of the principal European countries and for India, and later figures for some ether countries.    Further,  these figures relate to the exports of All Glasses of cotton piece goods.    The following additional Table has, accordingly, been prepared in the Board of Trade, in case it may be of interestEXPORTS OF ALL CLASSES OF COTTON PIECE GOODS.1913.       jTOO Kilogs. jj438,061     ! 376,373 280,190(a) I 466,25843,38388,092491,92248,881not availablenot available1925. 100 Kilogs.203,424 266,960 236,251 460,266 65,434 30,563655,46919I Percentage iVariation j        in 19261 from100 Kilogs.203,817 265,160 274,656 504,316 52,263 31,828(estimated on 10 months) 511,000(estimated on 9 months) 24,000(estimated on 9 months) 6,000(estimated on 11 months) 349,5001913.1925.k EUROPEAN ENTRIES.[Germany....

It will be seen from the foregoing additional Table that Germany&apos;s exports of cotton textiles were about the same in 1926 as in 1925, but she was 53% below her pre-war basis.    In 1926 Holland had gone back by 1% since 1925 and was    30% below pre-war.   Belgium has gained 16% over 1925 and she practically equalled the trade she had before the war.    France,  (perhaps because of changes of territory) shows a gain of 3% over 1913.    French exports in 1926 were 10% greater than in 1925.    Switzerland has gone back by 20% in 1926 as comparted with 1925.    Italy has receded by 22% for 1926, as compared with 1925, while she was actually still 4% better than she had been before the war.   Spain and Hungary have receded since 1925, Spain by 21% and Hungary by 15%.    Czecho Slovakia has declined since 1925 by 15%. Looking at Europe as a whole there was a general decline in cotton textile exports of about 6% in 1926, as against 1925, and of about 15% as against her pre-war figure.   The United States lost about 5% last year, but they were nearly 19$ higher than they had been before the war.As regards the Asiatic area, we have figures only for the first ten months of 1926 for Japan, but on that basis she gained 10% in 1925 over 1925,   and she exported nearly three times as much as she had done before tho war.    For the year 1926, India was 8yh up as compared with 1925 in her exports of piece goods, and she was over 100% greater than she had been in 1913.

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN 1925 AND 1926.COMPARISON WITH 1909-13.The accompanying chart traces, month by month, the variations in the volume of our imports and exports during the last two years. The values represented on the chart are those prevailing in the year 1924 and the recorded values have been converted in the manner outlined in our article on the volume of trade in last week&apos;s issue of the &quot; Journal.&quot; The corresponding figures for the five years 1909 to 1913 are also shown at the average values prevailing in 1924, after making an estimated allowance for the effects of the separation of the Irish Free State on the&apos; recorded values of the trade of the United Kingdom. The figures shown relate to total imports and British exports, and the course of our re-export trade is not traced.The figures for any one month of any particular year are necessarily liable to accidental variations and so can-not be of any particular significance. But the compara-tively steady trend of the figures for the average of the five years 1909 to 1913, particularly when allowance is made for differences in the number of days in the months, indicates that for this period such accidental variations have been smoothed out. The chart shows that normally the volume of imports is at its minimum in the summer, starts rising about September, reaches the maximum in December and gradually sinks back till the minimum is again reached, about May. Comparing the curve of imports in 1926 and bearing in mind that imports in June were probably swollen owing to delays caused in May by the general strike, it would appear that the maximum effects of the coal stoppage on the volume of our imports occurred in the third quarter of the year and that the seasonal expansion in the fourth quarter was less marked than it normally is. As regards British exports, the maximum effects of the coal stoppage were delayed till about August and no distinct signs of improvement had been reflected in the figures up to the end of the year.(9980   Wb. 22795-27i23   250.   2/27 .
