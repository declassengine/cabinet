II.-POSITION  IN CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.The resumption of work in this industry after the settlement of the dispute was more or less general, but the reabsorption of miners was somewhat hindered by a shortage of railway wagons and other difficulties. In some areas a considerable surplus of workers still exists.IRON AND STEEL.During the latter half of the year the production of iron and steel was more or less at a standstill. The settlement of the coal dispute has made possible the commencement of active operations in most areas, the Midlands being one of the first to recover. By the end of the year a number of blast furnaces had been relit, and it is reported that there are now more in operation than during the period immediately before the coal strike. Owing to the acute shortage of pig-iron, the steel industry was unable to show any appreciable signs of recovery before the close of the year, but the position has improved considerably since then, and prospects of the next three months in most areas are stated to be satisfactory. A considerable improvement in the tinplate industry was manifest during December.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The past year, and especially the latter half, has been one of the very worst ever experienced in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industry. It is likely, however, that, owing to the amount of orders which have accumulated, a con-siderable improvement will take place during the next few7 months. At present there is little to indicate that the number of contracts which have been booked is of such a magnitude as to bring about anything like a revival in this industry.ENGINEERING.The depression in the engineering trades, which, owing to the shortage of materials, had been particularly severe during the first two months of the quarter, eased somewhat during December. The prospects in marine engineering for the next quarter are stated to be more satisfactory. In the electrical section the position was more satisfactory during December, while the motor industry recovered from the seasonal slackness which was in evidence during the previous quarter.TEXTILES.Cotton. The employment position in the cotton industry improved con-siderably during the quarter, the percentage of unemployment falling from 19&quot;7 at the end of October to 13&apos;2 at the end of December. This improvement can be attributed largely to the abandonment of organised short-time working; it is difficult at present to say whether it will be maintained.Woollen and Worsted. Although a considerable amount of short-time working is still prevalent in many centres, the position in the worsted industry showed a further slight improvement during the quarter.Other Textiles. On the whole there has been a slight all-round improvement in the other branches of the textile industry. In the hosiery section this improve-ment, which was chiefly evident during November and December, was mostly of a seasonal nature. The linen industry is in a more satisfactory position than at the end of last year, while the jute industry has recovered from the depression which was manifest during the previous quarter.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.The usual seasonal slackness which is evident in these industries in the last; quarter of the year was accentuated this year by a shortage of constructional materials. A slight improvement in the position of the brick and tile industry was, however, evident during December.
CLOTHING TRADES.There was only a very slight improvement during the quarter in these trades, and the position is on the whole rather worse than at the end of last year. The principal improvement has occurred in the boot and shoe industry, largely owing, it is reported, to the renewed demand for pit boots from mining centres.POTTERY.Before the beginning of the quarter this industry, largely owing to its utilisation of alternative sources of fuel, had begun to recover from the acute depression which was brought about by the shortage of coal supplies. The improvement was maintained during October, but since then there has been little change in the position.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.In railway services and in the docks employment improved somewhat during the quarter, particularly in the last month. The position in shipping services at the end of the year was, however, somewhat worse than at the beginning of the quarter.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes nut in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned. The figures given for December 1925, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at -					Dec. 24,1926.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting-, &amp;c, raw materials.Note. No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of men employed on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended December 3lst, 192G, was 2,643 as compared with 2,108 for the corresponding quarter of 1925.
IV. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT.(Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison Avith the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of October, November and December, 1926 (with the corresponding figures for the year 1925), and for the nine months ended the 31st December, 1926 and 1925, respectively, are set out in the following Table: Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

The cost of the Overseas settlement free passage scheme for ex-Service men and women and their dependants (now rapidly approaching termination), which up to 31st March, 1926, had amounted to approximately  2,419,450, is not included in this table.   Neither is the cost included of certain training of ex-Service men carried out in Ireland at a cost to ,   the Imperial Exchequer of approximately  255,425.[15717]
Unemployment Insurance&quot;.(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Pund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s.

Until the 30th June, 1926, since extended by the Act of 1926 to the 31st December, 1927, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to January 1, 1927.Expenditure                    Benefit paid        ....         ....         .... 282,329,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 26,927,000Section 9 Unemployment Insurance Act (No. 2), 1924, and Section 25-Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 2,895,000 Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....          ....          .... 1,723,000Interest (Net)       ...          ....          .... 143,000314,017,000 Income Contributions Employers .... .... ....   105,245,000Employed .... .... ....     94,927,000Exchequer .... .... ....     71,262,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men)       ....      3,662,000--   275,096,000Balance of Old Pund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Employers .... .... ....      5,825,000Employed .... .... ....      5,825,000Exchequer .... .... ....      3,884,000----     15,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net).... .... .... 22,640,000Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future Contribu-tions, &amp;c................. 747,000314,017,000* Nolle-The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1927,  293,000,000.

(C.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20. To assist in&apos; the provision of employment&quot; for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn ;i grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during-Year.

February 1924 Programme.A further additional programme estimated to cost  13,500,000 was authorised by the late Government, towards which the Road Fund was to contribute a maximum of  10,400,000. Owing to the inclusion of certain road schemes previously covered by earlier programm.es, the amount of the Road Fund ooatribution now shows a slight increase.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs and (6) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes up to the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement Scheme came to an end, is estimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loaned by the Public Works Loan Board. Interest in respect of such loans is payable by Councils. Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, the Exchequer bears the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; Small Holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), so far as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exechequer assistance takes the form of annual contributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates. These contributions will not commence until the year 1927-28 and their total capitalized value cannot at present be estimated.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer. Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciable cash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from the surplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.Land Settlement.(A.)

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared by the Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant was, as an emergency measure, for so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute, raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.From the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles exceeded 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.A per capita grant fixed by the Minister for each Authority separately equal to the approved average weekly cost to the Authority of each Juvenile in average attendance, taking into account recurrent expenditure only, during the twelve months which ended on the 30th June, 30th September, or 31st December, 1925, whichever was the latest period for which consecutive claims had been received. If complete figures for one year ending on one of the above dates were not available, or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by the Minister on such information, including the Authority&apos;s proposals for 1926/27, as was available to him.(2.) To Authorities in ivhose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during the twelve months ivhich ended on the 23rd November, 1925.- Either (i) a per capita grant calculated as in (1) above, but equal to three-quarters only of the approved average weekly cost, or (ii) a grant of 75 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by the Authority during the financial year 1926/27, as the Authority chose.Schemes for Training Women and Juveniles and Young Unemployed Fit Men.(Estimates, Unclassified Services, Vote 2.)(a.)

Up to the 31st July, 1924, the cost of this scheme was met partly from Exchequer Grants and party from other sources, but, as from the 1st August, 1924, the whole cost has been borne by the Exchequer.

Young Unemployed Fit Men.The Ministry of Labour is conducting, as an experimental measure, a scheme of training for the benefit of young unemployed men between the ages of 19 and 25 (up to 29 for ex-service men) of a class who, owing to the prolonged trade depression, have had no opportunity of learning a skilled trade.
