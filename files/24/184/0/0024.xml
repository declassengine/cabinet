[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, &quot;jPrinted far the Cabinet.   January 1927.SECRET.&quot; CABINET.CP. 24 (27)Draft Foreign Office Note to the Soviet Government.NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I have carefully considered tlie terms of this suggested Note, CP. 17 (27). All the prefatory portions of it down to the words &quot;relationship between the two countries,&quot; about three parts of the way on page 3, are in my judgment admirable. But the conclusion presents so feeble an appearance and lags so far behind the massive earlier indictment, that if it is really proposed to conclude in a vein so trivial, I do not think that the Note is worth sending at all. On the other hand, the prefatory matter, with the appendices, possesses veiy great documentary value. Being unwilling to lose the weight of this controversial material, presented in so compendious a form, 1 should propose to send the Note as it stands with a very important variation. I should delete all that follows in the draft after the words &quot; an unprecedented relationship between the two countries.&quot; I should in substitution insert the following words : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government on the contrary take this opportunity of making it formally plain to the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics that they do not propose hereafter to attempt any repetition of remonstrances which have been received with such constant and public contempt in the past few years. Unless, therefore, the anti-British campaign at Rome and abroad ceases forthwith-whether it proceeds overtly from the Soviet Government or covertly from those for whom the Soviet Government is, as above made plain, responsible   His Majesty&apos;s Government holds itself at liberty to determine forthwith and without any further negotiation or discussion all diplomatic relationship of any kind now subsisting or purporting to subsist between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.&quot;From the diplomatic point of view this language is no doubt, open to amendment. But its meaning is plain and the suggestion, such as it is, may afford the basis of a useful discussion.BIRKENHEAD.India Office, 26th January 1927.17-15       100   1.27
