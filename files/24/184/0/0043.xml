3 OjjNk. -. y J ^.&apos;    THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.DRAFT    NOTE    TO   THE   SOVIET    GOVERNMENT.        CO Eg NO,%S5__SECRET MEMORANDUM   BY   THE    MINISTER    OF    LABOUR.C&quot;.l&quot;43(27) . &quot; &apos; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;I have read the terms of the suggested Note to the Soviet Government (C.P.17(27)) most carefully.     In my opinion the balance of advantage is in favour of the despatch and publication of such a Note.There are, however, three points in connection with it, which are important and deserve consideration -(l)    The date of publication.      Published at any time the Note should have a salutary effect - subject to the considerations mentioned in (2).      Publication, however, within the next week or ten days should have an especially beneficial effect on public opinion in the country,      Our present policy in China is right but is subject to much domestic misconception,     The vast majority of people have no real conviction of the extent and nature of Bolshevik intrigues in inflaming the Chinese against us.     They wonder why it is we who are singled out for hostility.    Some of the documents quoted in the despatch will be very Illuminating In this respect.i(2)    A better apparent raison d&apos;&amp;tre should be given for the Note.     As it stands, the conclusion is a difficulty -as the Secretary of State for India has felt.     In the present draft it appears tame and almost meaningless.     But an equal difficulty applies to the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India.     His variant contains a definite threat.
t3 jJ !-jIf the Russian Government dp not bow to It, but continue to act as before - no better and no worse - what is to be our position?     Unless we are prepared there and then to break off relations, our position will be worse than at present.     The difficulty in both cas^s arises from the Note being drafted as a &quot;bolt from the blue&quot;.     But this is unnecessary as It Is undesirable.     To judge from Mr,. Gregory!s recent conversation with the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires, it should be the easiest matter to encourage the latter to make a&apos; proposal for closer relations.     The Note could then teke the form of a stern negative to any suggestion of closer relations without any comnv^tal as regards those presently existing.(3)    Both In the Note Itself and the appendices some of the references to British Trade Unions might with advantage be revised.Detailed suggestions can be made on this point if a decision is taken on the main question of its publication.(Intd) .   A. 3-M.Ministry of Labour. 8th February, 1927.
