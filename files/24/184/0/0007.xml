Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1927.SECRET.Copy No.   30CP.(27).GABINET.VISIT OF THE EMPIRE  PARLIAMENTARY  DELEGATION  TOAUSTRALIA.IT may be of interest to the Cabinet if I circulate a few notes upon the recent visit of the Empire Parliamentary Delegation to Australia. These impressions were, I need not say, gathered in very fleeting circumstances without any time to check them or verify them, and often as the result of conversations which obviously could not be the subject of anything in the nature of cross-examination. With this preface the following sketch must be taken just for what it is worth.Australia has a wonderful climate and almost unlimited resources. Through-out the whole continent there is no extreme cold and the seasons are always open. Nevertheless, there is immense variety of temperature, climate, and circumstance suitable for almost every conceivable form of produce. It is true that over a very large area the rainfall is slight, often to such a point as to involve many months of drought, but then the ideal climate for the production of wool is one so dry that it just falls short of a drought, and if it sometimes oversteps the mark these occasional extremes are almost the necessary condition for making Australia the greatest wool country in the world. But the continent is not all dry, and in the south there is a relatively large rainfall, which, acting upon a soil of wonderful fertility, produces the finest wheat. In the north, on the other hand, which is in the tropics, there is abundant opportunity for every sort of tropical produce, such as cotton and sugar. This is by the coast. But on the high tableland behind the coast there is a temperate climate combined with the richest soil. And here, as over great areas in the soutb.7 dairying on the largest scale is carried on with every physical condition for success. Add to these resources unsurpassed fruit-growing districts in Tasmania, and along the Murray River, and, lastly, in different parts, minerals of every kind and in the greatest profusion gold and silver, zinc and lead, copper and iron. There is good coal in New South Wales and a wonderful deposit of brown coal in Victoria, which, lying just below the surface, extends for many miles and, at any rate for local development, is an unlimited source of power. No doubt it is also due to the climate that even to the most cursory glance the physical qualities of the race are seen to be excellent. The conditions of life are in the main equally favourable. Housing is good. Everyone appears to be well fed. Everyone seems to have money to lavish upon enjoyment. Popular games are universal; racing is a national passion.I presume that it is these physical conditions and the consciousness of these vast natural resources which have produced the particular complexion of the Australian character. In the main, Australians strike one as a material people, with an over-whelming national and individual optimism. This optimism has, as everywhere, its well-known advantages. It gives courage and leads to enterprise, but I am not sure that it makes for a sense of duty. There is in Australia a remarkable lack of social conscience in the well-to-do. This defect was represented to me from more than one quarter as a serious blemish in their equipment. It is possible that the defective social conscience and the materialistic outlook arise from the same cause. However that may be, the materialist element also is there. For example, it was remarked to me that&apos;places of worship are not thought of as essential in the establishment of a new settlement, and that the brand of nonconformity in Australia has no fervour. It is, of course, an excellent thing that there should be very little poverty and noMemorandum  by the Lord  Privy Seal.[15636]b
destitution, but this does not help the spiritual side. Charity tends to wither when there are no objects for it. I think it may be said that the nearest approach in the character of the people as a whole to a spiritual side lies in their loyalty and patriotism. Of these there is no doubt whatever. It may be that it is the urgent demand in human nature for some disinterested aspiration which makes the Australians, in the absence of anything still higher, throw the whole of that part of their being upon the ideals of the Throne and the Empire. I should say that, in that particular at any rate, Australia is far in front of the Mother Country.This characteristic is not inconsistent with a vivid aspiration after nationhood within the Empire and Australians are anxious about their security as a nation. Though their loyalty is, I believe, quite disinterested, yet they are acutely conscious that their interest lies on the same side. They are fully aware, that, in their present stage of development, they cannot stand alone and the danger of Asiatic aggression is never forgotten. National aspiration, therefore, and political apprehension combine to make them desire the strength which comes from development in popula-tion and development in resources. To them a White Australia is fundamental and they realise that a White Australia can, in the long run, only be safeguarded by multiplying their numbers and fructifying their wealth. This is the popular conviction and is, indeed, obvious enough.It would seem that a policy of attracting migrants and attracting capital is prescribed by these conditions and would be accepted with popular acclamation. But, in fact, it has not altogether so turned out. The Cabinet will onlv appreciate the obstacles which stand in the way of this result if they recall to their mind the difficulties of the Australian Constitution.Besides the Federal Government, Australia has six other Governments. These  the State Governments have, over a large field of administration sovereign powers, and, in particular, over ever)rthing which concerns land and industry and social conditions. Amy invasion of this field by the Federal authorities is jealously resisted. So long as the Federal Government confines itself to relations external to the States, it is within its province, but where external relations touch industrial conditions or where inter-State relations have to be adjusted on the industrial side, every act of the Federal Government is under suspicion. And it should be noted that in this unsympathetic attitude the State. Governments apparently reflect the wishes of the electors. It is a striking circumstance that the same voters who will return to power a Nationalist Federal Prime Minister to look after Imperial relations on patriotic lines, and who will return what we should call a Conservative Local Authority to keep down the burden of local taxation, will maintain a Labour State Government in office as being best qualified to look after the wages and industrial conditions of the working man. They see no inconsistency in this combination. They use each party to carry out what they consider it to be best qualified to under-take. And when the working class is having regard to the conditions of its own life its governing obsession is to maintain, and if possible to improve, the standard of living a standard which it identifies with the rate of wages. The results are apparent. The basic wage in New South Wales is  4 5s. a week, and in Queensland it is  4 15s. The other States are not far behind. And in order to safeguard this standard there is a Labour Government in every State except Victoria, and there the anti-Labour Government is tottering and hopelessly weak. The policy which these Lfhour Governments pursue, under the mandate of the constituencies, is of the crudest character. Wages courts to fix the rate of wages, which are directed to decide not the wages which an industry can bear, but the wages which the circum-stances of the worker prescribe. And more logically than the Labour party at home, Australian Labourites perceive that no such policy is possible except behind the wall of protection. The Federal Government is not a Labour Government, but upon this subject the Federal Government, whatever its own private views may be, has no sufficient political strength to resist, and wages tribunals with protection, an ever-growing protection, are universally accepter!. Indeed, protection has become so fundamental that public opinion prescribes it even in the case of industries which barely exist in Australia at all. I need not say, however, that wages courts and protection do not provide a water-tight remedy. Australians are imprisoned in the well-known vicious circle where a tariff is used to protect the rate of wages. The tariff raises the cost of living: therefore the wages court raises the wages : and with the wages rises the cost of production, till a further appeal is made for compensation for this increased cost bv an increase in the tariff. And the whole process begins over again. In Australia this exasperating system is intensified by the unsound basis on which the standard of living was originally calculated.   When the policy
was first entered upon the standard was experimentally based upon what would be reasonably considered comfortable for a married man with three children, and though, in fact, the average has turned out to be a married man with half a child, the basis has never been altered, but has always made the rate of wages unduly high, even upon the assumption of the soundness&quot; of the vicious system which 1 have described.The most remarkable reaction of this system is to be observed in its effect in strangling the export trade. Wool and Wheat are, indeed, produced under such favourable conditions that, at any rate for some time to come, no handicap on them will be effective. But in such commodities as sugar and dairy produce the cost of labour, and therefore the cost of production, is so high that it is impossible for Australian producers without assistance-to compete in the world market. I say without assistance because the. effort to escape from economic consequences has led to the adoption of the remarkable expedient of making the internal Australian trade pay for the export trade. There is an actual levy made upon all sugar and butter sold in Australia, and the proceeds of the levy is used to subsidise sugar and butter sold for export. In other words, every Australian consumer has to pay more for his sugar and his butter in order that the same commodity may be sold to consumers beyond the seas at the world price. In the case of sugar this has not unnaturally led to an agitation to limit production, so as to avoid the unprofitable, export and spare, the pocket of the home consumer. In the case of butter the figures are not so glaring, and, for the present at any rate, the imposition is accepted.These, cases are flagrant. They can only mean sooner or later a limit on pro-duction. And it has become practically an admitted element of Labour policy that, except where climatic conditions or the fiscal policy of Great Britain give very special advantages, production and consumption should be treated as conditioned by a self-contained Australia. The Labour party, that is to say, have accepted the conclusion that in the general case where producers have to compete in the world market the cost of production must come down, and as this threatens the rate of wages and, as it is thought, the standard of living, in the general case the world market must be abandoned. Limitation of development, of course, must follow. The internal market for primary industries can only be extended by the increase of secondary industries. Therefore, primary and secondary industries must wait upon each other, and the only safe course according to this creed is for the State Governments not to assist or countenance any increase in primary produce until there are enough secondary industry workers to absorb it. I said just now that this conclusion does not follow where there are special-climatic conditions e.g., in the case of wool and wheat nor where the fiscal policy of Great Britain gives a special advantage. The fruit cultivation of the Murray River lives on the British preference. The only thing that the fruit cultivators desire is to have more of it. With this assistance they can just manage to compete in the British market without lowering the high standard of living, which is considered a sine qua non, and with a little more preference the, fruit cultivation could be extended on the same satisfactory conditions. A contro-versialist might say that British preference maintains a much better standard of living on the Murray River than the British fruit consumer, who pays for it, himself enjoys.But Avith the exceptions which I have mentioned in the last paragraph, the general view of the Labour party is, as I have said, that the simultaneous growth of secondary industries is the only condition under, which it is safe to promote the development of primary industries. Even so restricted, however, Labour mentality involves a further limitation. The growth of secondary industries is to them not quite simple. So far as established secondary industries are concerned, it is thought that an increase of workers would be a risky affair. Would their wage standard remain safe even behind the rampart of wages courts? It would be wiser not to take the chance. The competition of urban immigration must therefore be discouraged: and several of the trades unions refuse to open the doors of their body to newcomers. The steel-workers were given to me as an example. In the midst of these pitfalls to which, as they see it, their economic faith exposes them, the safest expedient in order to increase the home market is the establishment of new secondary industries rather than the development of established ones. In wool, for example, there is an. opportunity. Secondary industries here have lagged behind primary. The textile industry has been neglected. Why not establish textile factories to consume part of their abundant raw material? So it was suggested to members of our delegation that it would be an excellent thing if we could induce a number of the best textile [15636] b 2. ..,,vr.1...;,      .:-:;.r, - - -^-&quot;-jr-,T-.rr. *,-:,:-.-;--   - -----     -       . -   - I. :     - -  -----\-;- - .-.   &quot;T-rr.-&apos;
experts from the West Riding to come out and establish the cloth industry in Queensland. This, however, was a most unpalatable suggestion to one of my Labour colleagues from Bradford. He was outraged that Great Britain should be&quot; asked to use her credit and influence in order to take the bread out of the mouths of the Bradford weavers!   Labour policy depends upon the local point of view.The overriding determination therefore at all costs to preserve the standard of living has the effect, owing to inflated wages, of making the development of primary industries for export unprofitable, and, further, of actually limiting the develop-ment of the home market by discouraging urban immigration, and, in particular, the recruitment of labour to certain staple secondary industries. This brings me to consider the effect of the Labour attitude I have described upon the question of migration generally. The comparison of figures of migration before the war and at the present time is disappointing. Notwithstanding the inducement of assisted passages, and the efforts that have been made by the Imperial and Federal Govern-ments, the average annual number of migrants of all kinds between 1921 and 1925 has been 37,000, whereas, just before the,war, they were 72,000, and if assisted migrants alone be taken, the average since 1921 has been 25,000, as against a pre-war figure of 46,000. Better results have been realised for the year just closed, but, anyhow, the averages I have given for the years 1921-25 are surprising because of the circumstances which ought to have told in the contrary direction. There has been the long-continued unemployment in Great Britain, and there has been the recent limitation of immigration into the United States under the quota system. Both these circumstances otight to have been reflected in an increase of migration into Australia, but the contrary has been the case.It should be explained that there are two doors for assisted migrants into Australia. They may be migrants entering upon requisition by the States Govern-ments, or they may be migrants coming upon nomination by residents already established in the country. The requisitions by the States are limited to migrants for agricultural employment, and, except in West Australia, even these are recruited without enthusiasm. It is not surprising that in 1925 the number of them was only just over 10,000. The nominated migrants, who are not limited to agriculture, and who do not require the initiative of the State Governments, showed a rather larger figure, namely, some 14,700. But, in truth, Labour policy has the effect of discouraging the entrance of migrants by nomination as well as by requisition because the standard of wages is so high. This has a restrictive effect on migration generally. In particular, farmers often cannot afford to employ adult labour at all. In some States in New South Wales and Queensland agricultural wages, like other wages, are fixed by law and at an impracticable figure. In others they are driven up merely by the competition of the urban wage rate alongside.It is therefore not at all wonderful that migration halts. How. can it be other-wise when the State Governments always excepting West Australia not only make no effort for it, but either discourage it or at any rate by their inflated scale of wages render it difficult except under favourable circumstances. I will revert to the evidence for this statement in a few moments. &apos;.But Western Australia is an exception. I believe Mr. Collier, the Premier of that State, was speaking quite correctly when he said that Western Australia would welcome the introduction of tens of thousands from the old land, because she has given practical proof of the sincerity of this statement. She is a comparatively poor State, but under, the migration agreement with the Imperial Government her proposals cover an expenditure of as much as 4 millions, as compared with 2 millions which is all the rich State of Victoria can point to, or 1 million the proposition of South Australia, and at the time of our visit nothing at all from Queensland. Even this last State adhered to the agreement, and has, I believe, woken up to action since we were there, but New South Wales has, up to now, declined to have anything to do with this effort of the Imperial and Federal Governments. Western Australia is in fact the only State where in the matter of migration we are upon firm ground. She has perhaps no very solid foundation of administrative experience to rely upon, but she means business.There is yet another regrettable side to Labour policy at any rate in the eastern States. There is throughout an atmosphere of unstable finance Socialist experiments which have to be paid for; an inflated personnel on State enterprises: attempts at economy only by starving replacements; jobs; waste; and sometimes corruption. These burdens&apos; involve charges which have to be met, and in a great measure they are met with borrowed money. Queensland is perhaps the greatest offender.   Her debt is increasing at the rate of some 4 millions a year, and the total
has been raised from 40 millions to 90 millions in ten years. The railways do not pay; the taxable income of the State has diminished. It was rumoured that in the twelve years of Labour Government many million acres have gone out of occupation. Whilst we were still in Australia, Mr. McCormack, the Labour Premier of Queensland, was compelled to admit in a public speech that upon State enterprises a loss of some 12 millions would have to be written off. Indeed, I do not think this statesman is under any illusion. The situation in Queensland is so patent that in confidential conversation lie declared that it could not continue, though whether he has the courage or the power to bring it to an end I cannot say. Probably Queensland is the worst of the lot, but I suspect New South Wales runs it hard. Taking the whole of Australia together, the aggregate States debt into which, of course, war debts do not enter at all has increased since 1914 from just under 400 millions to just over 600 millions an increase of 50 per cent. Moreover, except in the case of Western Australia, we came across a remarkable absence of any practical belief in sinking funds, a most significant illustration of the financial methods which are fashionable in Australia. It was clear to me that, though Mr. Bruce has felt himself bound to contest the criticism which has been levelled in England against Australian finance, the Federal Government out there is very uneasy. Dr. Page, the Acting Prime Minister, explained to me that the States Governments have borrowed so much in order to defray maintenance and administration charges that they have exhausted their credit and can by themselves get nothing for new developments. Senator Pearce, the vice-president of the lt,xecutive Council, and I believe a close political friend of the Prime Minister, went one step further and told me that not only has the credit of the States fared badly in the City of London, but that even the Federal Government has had difficulties when they came here lately for a loan. No doubt State finance hangs round the Federal neck like a stone. It is true that by agreement there is a restriction on the loan activities of most of the States except by arrangement with the Federal Government, but this gives Federal Ministers no control over the expenditure side of State finance, which is out of their hands. And even this agreement does not apply to New South Wales, which has hitherto refused to give it any countenance. I am sure the Federal Government are doing their utmost to get out of these difficulties. Their policy is clear, namely, to persuade the country to correct the mistake made at the time of federation, and to obtain a transfer of essential powers from the States to the Commonwealth. They have, of course, just tried unsuccessfully to secure by referendum the control of industrial administration. This has failed, but their purpose remains. The same spirit is evident in their attitude towards a movement which exists in several States in favour of partition. Not only is there particularist jealousy of a most striking kind between State and State, but in one or two instances the same tendency shows itself within the State itself. This suits the policy of the Federal Government. It would be easier for them to deal en maitre with smaller States, and I was given to understand in deep confidence that in so far as they are concerned they would be glad to see the States break up. In the meantime, they hope that experience will teach Labour Governments their financial follies. Dr. Page told me that it Avas impossible to resist the public opinion in favour of high Avages (Avhich are identified in the public mind Avith a high standard of living) and the consequential high Protection Avithout which high Avages Avould be impossible. But he trusted that the effect of these wages on the cost of production, and of the cost of production upon the export trade and the irritation caused by the system of compensating the export trade at the expense of the home trade to Avhich the country has been drh&apos;en will ultimately convince opinion of the fallacy of uneconomic wages. The fact is, as I gathered from Mr. Brooks, of the Tariff Board, thoughtful members of the Labour party-are already becoming conscious of economic nemesis; and this is the most favourable symptom in the evolution of Labour opinion which Ave encountered. As I haAre said, the Labour Premier of Queensland, though under the rule of the Labour party he is admittedly bound hand and foot by the Labour organisation, is quite aware that State OAvnership has proved itself a curse, and has written off many millions as the measure of the failure of State enterprise. Also, he recognises that the present cost of production cannot be continued, and that it is inconsistent with  any substantial export policy. In the meantime he told us that he does not beliewe that, in present conditions, migration into Queensland to any great extent is possible. He suggested that the delegation should stimulate a change of public opinion by using the danger of Japanese aggression   to   the   prospects   of   a   White  Australia   as   a   lever;    and   so
acutely did he feel the character of the existing situation that, like many other responsible persons, he actually looks for bad times in Australia as the only condition through which an exit from their false position can be found. The most noteworthy element in this description of Mr. McCormack&apos;s opinions for the purposes of our enquiry was his conclusion that in the present condition of Labour policy substantial migration into Queensland cannot be hoped for. The evidence, indeed, outside West Australia, that the Labour party, who are in power in four of the eastern States, is not in favour of an active migration policy here and now is overwhelming, though I need not say that as an ultimate remedy for the weakness of the country against alien aggression they would no doubt support it as heartily as anybody else. Even in Victoria, where there is a weak Nationalist Government, policy is much affected in this direction by a strong Labour Opposition. Mr. Scullin, a leading member of that Opposition, specially recommended to my notice as a moderate man, is in favour of migration in principle, but, as usual, subject always to the main-tenance of the high standard of living; and he accepts the necessary consequences, that primary production must keep pace with the development of secondary industries, and they must only increase pari passu; and that an export policy is inconsistent with the requisite high standard of living. Mr. Cann, a member of the New South Wales Labour Cabinet, frankly confessed in reply to a direct question that his Government is not in favour of migration, though personally he took the other view. But he added that in this his Government represented the Labour party, the majority of which would be against migration. Canon Garland, who speaks for the Church Emigration Society in Queensland, stated that it was true that Labour is against migration into the towns, and has been rather reluctant to admit it even into the country districts because of the danger of migrants being driven into the towns. Mr. Bankes Amery, the representative of the Imperial Government, summed up the matter by saying that, with the exception of the West Australian Government, none of the States Governments are keen about migration; that the New South Wales Government is definitely against it; and that the Queensland Government would like to secure a larger population, but though they have been in power for thirteen years they have never wholeheartedly made any efforts in this direction; and, finally, that the Victorian Government is both incompetent and also always trying to propitiate Labour, and that its migration policy, therefore, also is weak and vacillating.The point is not that Australian opinion as a whole is against migration on the contrary, many Australians are very keen for it, and, in a mild way, probably a large majority are in favour of it but in practice, in present circumstances, it is held by those who run Labour policy and control Labour Governments that migration is up against their theory as to the best way to maintain their beloved standard of living. And in pursuit of this ideal they will go all lengths, even to the point of insisting that untrained workers should be paid wages which are uneconomic even for a highly-trained man. The standard of living is the vital point, and Labour policy is bogged in the uneconomic morass into which this pursuit of the standard of living has plunged them. Senator Newlands, President of the Federal Senate, insisted to me, like the others I have quoted, that the situation cannot continue, and that the professed optimists themselves are, in fact, insincere, and are well aware of the essential unsoundness of the position. But I need not *say that far the most striking evidence of the economic situation is contained in the report of the Tariff Board, published on the 30th June of last year. The Tariff Board is the authority which advises the Federal Government as to the revision from time to time of the customs tariff. Mr. Brooks, a member of it, explained to me that some months ago they found themselves obliged to recommend a great increase in the duty on steel incidentally very unfavourable to Great Britain and they took the opportunity of pointing out to Mr. Bruce the hopelessness of the vicious circle which I have already described, and in which they were taking their share : the rise of the tariff leading to a rise in prices, involving a rise of wages and therefore a rise of the cost of production, which, in its turn, necessitates a further rise in the tariff and so on for ever. Thereupon Mr. Bruce asked them to give him a lead, and this lead is contained in the report of last June. The relevant portion of it expresses the opinion that the industrial unions of the Commonwealth should be induced to realise the critical position into which Australia is drifting and the absolute necessity for preventing the wages gap from becoming still wider between Great Britain, the Continent of Europe and the Commonwealth, otherwise, the Tariff Board, placed as it is in the position to
take a comprehensive and intimate view of all Australian industry, can see nothing but economic disaster ahead, and that at no very distant date.It is to be hoped that Mr. Bruce&apos;s intention which Mr. Brooks seemed to indicate may become effective and that he will follow the lead which, at his suggestion, the Tariff Board has given him.  Unless he does so it would seem that his policy may easily break down.   Take, for example, the Migration and Development Commission.   This Commission seems admirably adapted to guide development into the best channels with the special view of promoting the flow of migration.   It is well calculated to make effective the efforts of the Imperial Government and the Federal Government as represented in the 34-million loan.    It will certainly stimulate schemes under this loan and give them the best direction, and it will also suggest the most effective and economical methods of putting Australian produce on the market.   In this way, by w-ell-considered development and scientific marketing, the margin available for profit will be increased and trade may be substantially expanded.   But unless Australian Labour mentality is modified these beneficent results must always be in jeopardy.   As the same Report of the Tariff Board from which I have already quoted points out, it is in the power of the various industrial unions to absorb any such margin by demands upon the Arbitration Court for a further increase of wages.  This increase the Board very truly say must ultimately defeat itself, and by continuously raising the cost of living bring about an industrial paralysis.   If, then, Mr. Bruce&apos;s policy is to survive, he must come to an understanding with Labour not to hamstring his Migration and Development Commission by claiming still higher wages, or he must persuade the electors to give him power to prevent this result by appropriate legislation.   I am afraid it is somewhat doubtful whether, for some years, he can achieve all this.   At any rate responsible people in Australia have to look at the situation as it is and as it has been officially described in the Report of the Tariff Board.   It is not surprising that, in the face of these facts, the Labour Premier of Queensland, member of the Labour party though he is, feels that bad times are the only exit; that Mr. Heal, a large farmer in the same State, thought that the best thing to hope for was &quot; a financial smash and have done with it&quot;; that Mr. Bankes Amery himself hardly sees how this result can be avoided; and that the President of the Federal Senate, whom I have already quoted, considers that not one but several years of financial stringency would be an excellent thing.   I need not say that it was no part of the duty of the Empire Parliamentary Delegation to make any public reference to these delicate matters.   One member of our body was more candid than the others, but most of us touched financial policy very gingerly.   In dealing with migration we confined ourselves for the most part to pointing out what the Mother Country had done for Australia in this respect; how anxious she is to help it forward; and how vitally important it is that Australian public opinion should make up its mind and whole-heartedly co-operate with the Federal Government and ourselves if the policy of a White Australia is to be made secure and if the present golden opportunity to obtain British migrants is not to be lost.One word as to our Imperial fiscal policy. There was evidence that as the Economic Committee and the Marketing Board become realised they will be valued. Incidentally I have already mentioned some of the results of the British preference on Australian trade. There is no doubt that it is highly appreciated. Mr. Paterson, the Federal Minister for Markets and Migration, spoke of it publicty in the highest terms. Sugar growers had benefited to the extent of nearly a million last year through the British preference: wine growers to the extent of  200,000; and dried fruits to the extent of  132,000. These public avowals were supported by our own experience in the case of the Murray River to which I have referred. The fruit industry there which, even as matters stand, is in some financial difficulty, would at once collapse if the British preference were withdrawn. And such was the effect of Australian official opinion upon the minds of our Labour colleagues that the acknowledgment that Australian responsible Ministers are in favour of the British preference was, as a matter of fact, inserted in the official report of the delegation at the suggestion of Mr. Arthur Henderson himself, though his objection to the principle no doubt remains.As regards the only other subject of capital importance which it was the duty of the delegation to approach, namely, the question of Imperial Relations, there is no fresh light that I can throw upon the issues which have been so completely discussed at the Imperial Conference. As will be understood by Mr. Bruce&apos;s attitude, Federal Ministers and Australian public opinion are anxious for improved
machinery. But it is worthy of remark that one or two men out there, who have paid special attention to these questions, expressed themselves as nervous lest, in acknowledging the complete power of self-direction of Dominions as regards their own domestic affairs, which is common ground, we should go too far towards independence from British hegemony, which is wholly out of tiie picture, as they, and, indeed, Australia generally, 1 believe, regard the Empire.The only other matter on this side of our enquiries which I ought to mention was the advocacy by representatives of other Dominions as well as of the Common-wealth, that greater efforts should be made to educate public opinion throughout the Empire upon the nature of foreign affairs and their bearing upon Imperial policy.It remains for me to add a few tentative words on the bearing.of our recent experience upon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. As I have said, the issues relating to Imperial relations have been dealt with in London, and I have no comment to make on them except to^ repeat that differentiation between the external policy of Great Britain and of the Dominions is not the wish of the Australian Common-wealth. They are for integration, not disintegration, of external policy, which is precisely our own view, and I hope, though I am not sure, the view of the other Dominions.Upon the subject of migration, undoubtedly the want of zeal for it in a large section of the Australian political world and the uneasiness of the financial situation are material considerations in guiding British policy. It is not efforts from our side that will counteract reluctance out there, nor will any action of ours prevent the results of a financial disaster if it were to occur. But the apprehensions on this head, which I have mentioned, are probably exaggerated, and in any case the smash  if there is to be a smash is probably not so near as is suggested. As Mr. Bruce has pointed out, this is not the first time that a catastrophe has been prophesied. Moreover, Australian opinion is undoubtedly undergoing a process of education and wiser counsels may prevail. The bad symptoms may well be temporary, whereas, the vigour of the race and the inexhaustible resources of the country are permanent assets. Lastly, both on the financial side and on the migration side, Western Australia is an exception. There may have been mistakes there but there is no want of zeal.There seems, therefore, no^ reason to change the lines of British policy, though, for the present, I should rather hesitate to emphasise them. An increase of preference might well be represented by my Labour colleagues as designed to maintain the high standard of living of the Australian producer at the expense of the much less comfortable British consumer. Similarly, I question whether we should take steps to encourage the investment of capital there until Australian Labour finance has become more stable. For the moment again we can hardly be responsible for further developing the use of Imperial credit in pressing migration upon an undecided Australian public opinion. For the time it would seem to be sufficient to encourage Mr. Bruce in his efforts in organising development and distribution; and, for ourselves, to be content with improving the preliminary training of migrants, administering the marketing fund, and carrying out the guarantees to which we are already committed in the 34-million loan, with a bias, so far as our influence extends, in favour of schemes which relate especially to Western Australia. Let us hope that before very long the Australian Nationalist party will be more active, or the Labour party more reasonable, in promoting whole-heartedly the migration policy required by a White Australia and the financial sobriety prescribed by our own administrative experience.SALISBURY.January 11, 1927.
