Printed fur the Cabinet.    February 1927. SECRET. *CP. 42 (27) $CABINET.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a preliminary appreciation by the Government of India of the results of the General Elections to the Legislative Assembly and the Provincial Legislative Councils.. i w i: BIRKENHEAD.4th February 1927.Letter from Government of India, Home Department, to the Secretary, Public and Judicial Department, India Office, dated 6th January 1927.Sir,I am directed to forward for the information of the Secretary of State a preliminary appreciation of the results of the recent elections to the Provincial Councils and the Legislative Assembly. Full appreciations of the situation in the provinces have not jet been received from Local Governments, and I am to explain that the Government of India may find it necessary to correct some of the views here stated in the light of further information. The detailed results of the elections have already been communicated to the Secretary of State by telegram, but a summary of the position of the various parties as ascertained up to date is attached to this letter.2. It must be understood that parties in India are in such a fluid state that the designations under which candidates stood for election afford no sure guide to the actual grouping which will emerge in the Councils. Most of the party labels have no-element of permanence, and do not stand for any intelligible principle. In these conditions it is not likely that the large, number of separate groups shown in the statement will maintain their identity. It is probable that when the Councils begin their work, practical requirements will lead to the development of new combinations.3. Moreover, the grouping, as reported in the statement, which is based on information received from Local Governments, must be to some extent arbitrary. In the absence of clear-cut party lines, there must be cross divisions, and it is not always clear when a combination of interests may be said to have emerged into the status of a party. In the United Provinces 50 seats are credited to the landholders, and this probably represents a more stable combination than most of the recognised &quot; parties,&quot; which are held together by little more than a name, but its opponents would probably dispute its title to be regarded as a regular party. Perhaps the most important example of this uncertainty of classification is to be found in the position of the Muhammadans. It is not yet apparent whether they will, where they form a&quot;&quot; substantial body, act generally as a Muhammadan party, or whether different sections will attach themselves to the groups which represent their particular shade of general political opinion and combine only when Muhammadan interests are concerned. It is probable that different tactics will be followed in different provinces. It is noteworthy that the main attempt to form a Muhammad an party, namely, in Bengal, has encountered serious difficulties, arising chiefly out of the personal jealousies of the leaders.4. Making due allowance for these considerations, it is possible to consider the results broadly on lines which were strongly emphasised during the elections, namely, Swarajists versus non-Swarajists. At one time it seemed probable that even this distinction rested on no very secure foundation, for there was good reason to believe that the Swarajists were in fact considerably divided among themselves on the main plank of their platform, i.e. refusal of office and boycott of the Councils from within, and that an important section of the party was anxious to take office. At the Congress meeting at, Gauhati, however, the party, whatever its internal divisions may have been, presented a united front and the official programme was endorsed without opposition. But should the section in favour of taking office break away at a later stage from these who maintain the old programme, they would become in effect indistinguishable from the Responsivists, just as the hitter in their turn are difficult to distinguish from Independents or Nationalists. The fact is that broadly speaking no party has any constructive policy, and their differences, so far as they are more than personal, represent merely different degrees of opposition to Government.1704       100   2.26
5. It was generally anticipated before the elections that the Swarajist Party would lose considerable ground. This anticipation was based on the fact that they&apos; clearly had the worst of the arguments, and that their policy for the last, three years had failed to show any practical results. It was recognised on the other hand that they still possessed indubitably the best indeed, in many provinces the only party machinery, though at the same time it was believed that the party had not very large financial resources. On the whole the results have been more favourable to the Swarajists than was anticipated. In Bengal they maintained their position, securing 41 seats as against 18 obtained by the other Hindu parties. In. Madras they won a surprising victory, here also securing 41 seats. This result, however, must be attributed rather to reaction against the Chief Minister and the non-Brahman Ministry, which had held power since the commencement of the reforms, than to any real enthusiasm for Swarajist principles. Indeed, the Madras Swarajists are those who are credited with the desire to take office. An important factor in the opposition to the Ministry, of which the Swarajist Party took full advantage, was the passing of the Religious Endowments Act, which, mobilised against the party which was responsible for it the widespread influence of the priests and the important financial resources of the temples. In Bihar and Orissa also the Swarajists have met with unexpected success, but here again it does not seem that the result represents any strong Swarajist feeling. The province is politically backward and tends to imitate Bengal, a tendency which had full opportunity to develop, as the elections in Bihar and Orissa took place later than those in any other province. There seems, however, to be little substance in the Swarajisni of Bihar. The results in this province appear to have been due in large part to personal jealousies between the great landholders and in some cases to their personal unpopularity. The Swarajists also used with full effect their power over the staff of such local bodies as they controlled.6. On the other hand, in the Punjab the Swarajists were definitely routed, and in the United Provinces they made comparatively little show. In both these provinces the activity of the Hindu Sabha, standing definitely for communal interests as against the more tolerant attitude of the Swarajists, played an important part in the defeat of the latter. In the Central Provinces the Swarajists lost considerable ground. In Bombay they did little, and in Assam it would appear that on the whole they did not maintain their position.7. With regard lo the prospect of Ministries, theoretically difficulties arising&quot;from the strength of the Swarajist Party might be expected in Bengal, Madras and Bihar and Orissa. In Bengal the situation, owing to the disunion of the Muhaimnadans, is obscure, and as a result of the meeting of the Congress it seems clear that here, at any rate, the Swaraj Party will do their utmost again to prevent the formation of a Ministry. In Madras a Ministry has actually been formed from the Independent Party, which represents only 24 seats, against 41 held by the Swarajists and 21 held by the Justice Party. The formation of a Ministry may be attributed to the strong desire of the Swarajists not to allow the Justice Party to come into power again. It seems most unlikely that the Madras Swarajists, even if they really wish to prevent the formation of a Ministry (which is doubtful), would find themselves in a position to do so. In Bihar and Orissa, in spite of the apparent Swarajist majority, the old Ministers have been reappointed and believe that I hey will be able to carry on.8. In the other provinces there are, no doubt, the usual difficulties in forming a satisfactory Ministry, from loosely cohering elements, but these difficulties are not connected with the Swarajist policy. In the United Provinces the old Ministers, based on the support of the landlords, have been reappointed. In the Punjab three Ministers have taken the place of two, and each of the three chief communities has a representative. The backing of the Ministry appears to be mainly the rural interest. In Bombay the Ministry appears to represent a selection, from the leaders of certain influential groups. There seems to be no reason why a Ministry should not be formed in the Central Provinces if the acute personal jealousies can be overcome.9. The probable, position in the I -egislative Assembly cannot be said to have declared itself. Much depends on whether the Muhammadans decide to form a party of their own or attach themselves to other groups. But in any case the.opposition to Government is likely to be strong and voiced by men of ability, and it does not seem probable that so much of the strength of the opposition will be dissipated in the futile tactics which distinguished the Swarajist, Party in the last Assembly. It is true that with the exception of the &quot;walk out,&quot; which has been abandoned, the official tactics of the Swarajists as laid down by the Gauhati Congress will remain much as they were before.   But in the Assembly the question of taking office does
not arise, and consequently the line of demarcation between Swarajists who have shed their extreme views and realise the practical handicap imposed by their party&apos;s past tactics on the one hand and non-Swarajists on the other, is likely to be less marked than in the Provincial Councils. It is possible that one of the features of the new Assembly may be a struggle for power between the Madras contingent of Swarajists, strongly led and compact, and the party under Pandit Motilal Nehru, whose position was decidedly shaken by the election, but who have succeeded in reasserting their programme at Gauhati.I have, &amp;c,H.
