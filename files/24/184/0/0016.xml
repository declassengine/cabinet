SECRET. Copy No.    g(jC.O.S. 62.(A Iso C.I.D. Paper No. 762-B.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.CANTON. DEFENCE  OF  SHAMEEN.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WE held a meeting this morning to re-examine the situation at Canton in accordance with the following conclusion of the Cabinet at their Meeting held on the 17th January, 1927 (Cabinet 2 (27)) :-&quot;(1.) That the above decisions in regard to our general policy and the defence of Shanghai involved a change in the political assumptions on which the Chiefs of Staff Committee had been ordered to make their recent report on the defence of Shameen, and that the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should reassemble on the following day to re-examine the question of the defence of Shameen on the assumption that Shanghai was to be held and that His Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government were no longer committed to the policy of avoiding hostilities with the military forces at Canton in all circumstances. The Chiefs of Staff were asked to make recommendations for revised instructions to the British Consul-General at Canton, and the Naval and Military authorities at Hong Kong.&quot;2. Sir Gilbert Grindle, of the Colonial Office, and Mr. Mounsey, of the Foreign Office, were present at our meeting, at which we also had the advantage of the advice of Rear-Admiral Stirling, late Commodore at Hong Kong, who only returned to England a few days ago.3. In our previous report (Paper No. C.O.S. 60, also OLD. Paper No. 759-B and OP. 8 (27)), we assumed that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to avoid any action which might precipitate hostilities Avith the Chinese military forces. We therefore recommended that while concessions should be protected up to the point where further resistance would inevitably result in open hostilities with Chinese troops, evacuation should take place in order to avoid such an eventuality. We also, for the same reason, considered that the action proposed by the Acting Consul-General, Canton, to threaten a blockade, and the bombing of important objectives at that place, should not be authorised.On the new assumption that His Majesty&apos;s Government are no longer committed to a policy of avoiding hostilities with the military forces of Canton in all circum-stances the situation requires re-examination.SHAMEEN.General Description.4. Shameen, the foreign concession of Canton, is on the point westward and above the City, southward of the western suburb and facing Macao Fort Passage or Back Reach. Its frontage is of irregular oval form, 2,850 feet long; its extreme breadth is 950 feet, and it is separated from the mainland by a canal 100 feet wide, faced with masonry, crossed by two stone bridges, one leading to the British, the other to the French concession, and having a stone embankment on the river side. [15660][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   January 1927.
Of the enclosed area four-fifths at the western end has been appropriated to the British Government, and. one-fifth at the eastern end to that of France.Besides the Consular offices, there is a church, library, reading rooms, &amp;c.The estimated foreign population of Canton is 700, most of whom reside in Shameen. There are about 150 British subjects resident in Shameen and about 83 living outside, distributed in the city of Canton and suburbs on both sides of the river.The two stone bridges referred to above are still standing. The canal is very muddy, usually contains three or four feet of water, and is not considered to be easily fordable. Usually, however, it is full of sampans and other craft. We are informed by the late Commodore, Hong Kong, that the canal can be easily cleared, and that replacement of the craft can be prevented by stationing gunboats so as to enfilade the waterway and the buildings bordering on it.Present Defences.5. The whole of the canal front at Shameen, including the two bridges, is at present protected by barbed wire along its whole length, and the French have two field guns in their concession.There are five British gunboats now stationed at Shameen. Three of these are the &quot; Insect &quot; class (each carrying two 6-inch guns and one 3-inch gun). The remaining two are the :! Moorhen &quot; and &quot; Robin,&quot; ships of a smaller class, drawing only two feet of water.   The speed of the latter is between seven and eight knots.Routes of Evacuation.6. The main communication between Hong Kong and Canton is by the Canton River.   This is heavily fortified, and divided for defence into three sections.The Lower Section comprises Sha-Kek, Tai-Kok-Tao and Pou-chao.The Centre Section comprises A-neung-hoi, Sheng-wang-t&apos;ong and Ha-wang-tong.The Upper Section comprises Danes Island, Yu-chu and Sha-lou. The number of guns is :  24 cm 21 cm. If) cm. 1S&apos;8 cm.Lower Section 6 13 2Centre Section ... 10 5 6Upper Section 3 23 6The armament is known to be very antiquated, and we have no information as to the amount of ammunition that may be available or as to the proficiency of the gun crews. We know, however, that in August last the forts on Danes Island carried out some target practice, and we have reason to believe that last year the Canton Government were trying to obtain ammunition and contact mines, in addition to aircraft, from abroad. Even if the crews are comparatively untrained and the ammunition is limited, the forts must constitute a certain menace to passing ships in view of the narrowness of the river.As already stated in our previous report (Paper No. CCS. 60), communication is possible at any time of the year with Shameen by routes (such as Moneypenny Creek) which avoid the defended channel.We are informed that the three gunboats of the &quot; Insect &quot; class draw too much water to be able to negotiate these alternative routes at the present time of the year. Special arrangements would, therefore, be necessary for their early withdrawal by the main channel. The smaller gunboats and sampans, which would have to be used in finally evacuating the concession, would have no navigational difficulty in negotiating these creeks. These routes, however, are narrow in some parts and pass through a densely populated district, though in the past the inhabitants have been well disposed towards us. All risk of interference with the final evacuation of the concession cannot, therefore, be precluded. We feel bound to warn the Committee of Imperial Defence of this risk.Possibility of Defending the Concession.7. Rear-Admiral Stirling confirmed the views of the local authorities at Hong Kong, which we accepted in our last report, that it should be possible to defend Shameen against the mob with the naval and. military resources available at Hong-Kong, but lie suggested the advisability not only of withdrawing Europeans now residing outside the concession to the Island of Shameen, but also of evacuating all non-combatants at an early stage.   He informed us that such persons could be
evacuated down the main stream to a point clear of danger from the shore within five hours. We concur in this view, and consider that the man on the spot should be left to decide when indications of impending mob violence render evacuation of non-combatants advisable.The evidence of Eear-Admiral Stirling also confirmed our previously expressed view that we cannot expect, with or without the co-operation of the French, to hold out indefinitely against serious attack by the Cantonese troops with the forces likely to be available for the defence of Shameen. It has, however, inclined us to the opinion that offensive action by aircraft, or even the threat of it, which we deal with in more detail below, might well have the result of preventing organised attack on the concessions.Bombing &quot;and Blockade of Canton.8. In our previous Report we stated that, in our opinion, the threat which the Acting Consul-General, Canton, proposed to make to the local Chinese General, if translated into action, would be calculated to precipitate hostilities and might hasten the crisis at Shanghai. The latest decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, quoted in paragraph 1 of this Report, alters the position.9. We were particularly impressed by the evidence of Rear-Admiral Stirling on the susceptibility of the Chinese to threats, particularly if these are backed up by evidence of strength. To illustrate this he informed us that in August last certain strike pickets holding British wharves at Canton were told that, if they did not evacuate them at once, we would sink their strike picket boats. The next morning it was found that the pickets had gone, the picket boats had been removed to a point some 10 miles down the river, an enclosure had been roped in round the wharves and police were stationed to keep the strike pickets out. Since then neither the pickets nor the boats have returned.10. Rear-Admiral Stirling held the view that the threat to bomb or shell vital points in Canton, and finally to blockade the city, particularly if followed at once by some demonstration of force (e.g., the appearance of aircraft), would have a considerable deterrent effect on the Cantonese, and that the effect of actual bombing or shelling would in all probability be enormous. He also suggested action by aircraft to cover an evacuation if and when this should prove necessary.11. In view of this decided expression of opinion by an officer possessing considerable local knowledge, we are now disposed to agree to a threat being conveyed by the Consul-General to the Chinese General in Command of the forces at Canton. We suggest, however, that the threat should be couched in vague though decided terms, no actual mention being made of bombing by aircraft or shelling. In order that the; greatest possible effect should be derived from the conveyance of this threat to the ^Chinese, we recommend that discretion should be given to the Acting Consul-General in concert with the Commodore at Hong Kong to arrange for a demonstration over Canton of as many British aircraft as possible at the moment that the communication is being made.12. In the opinion of Rear-Admiral Stirling a blockade of Canton would have a considerable effect on the Cantonese Government. We therefore recommend that a blockade should be included in the measures to be approved if an attack on Shameen takes place. In this connection we note from a recent telegram that the French are also prepared to undertake such a measure.Use of Aircraft.13. The naval aircraft at present available at Hong Kong can reach Canton, but the range and carrying capacity will be considerably curtailed if the use of a land aerodrome is not permitted.Hitherto, aircraft has not been permitted to operate from the Kowloon Aero-drome, which is ready for use, in view of possible objections that might be taken by other signatories to the Washington Agreement. We would suggest, however, that as the use of aircraft is now contemplated only against the Chinese and not in connection with the coast defences, this restriction should be removed. The amount of air pressure that could be brought to bear on Canton would be greatly increased if some of the aircraft at present provided with floats were refitted with land under-carriages.
We have never admitted that the use of the Kowloon Aerodrome is prohibited in so far as operations against the Chinese are concerned, by the Washington Agreement, and we ask that this will be borne in mind by the Foreign Office.We would also point out that any diffidence regarding the use of an aerodrome situated in our own territories at Hong Kong is hardly compatible with the organisa-tion of measures for the use of an aerodrome in Chinese territory at Shanghai.14. The situation which confronts us at Canton involves risks, whatever course is adopted. We do not conceal from the Committee of Imperial Defence that a policy of tenacious resistance involves risks both locally, owing to the exposed position of Shameen and the nature of the line of withdrawal, as well as from the point of view of possibly precipitating events elsewhere in China, and particularly at Shanghai, but on balance we believe that the course we recommend is the best.15.   In conclusion, therefore, we summarise our recommendations as follows : (1.) That the British Consul-General at Canton, the Governor and the naval and military authorities at Hong Kong&apos; should receive instructions to the following effect: (a.) That the men on the spot should have full discretion to hold the Shameen as long as they consider possible, whether against mob violence or against Cantonese troops, with such forces as can be placed  at their disposal from Hong Kong, having regard to conclusion (c) below. (b.) That arrangements should be made for the evacuation from Shameen of all non-combatants before serious trouble eventuates, the exact time for such evacuation being left to the man on the spot, (c.) That no further reinforcements can be despatched to Hong Kong for the defence of Shameen, and that one battalion must be held in readiness at Hong Kong to proceed to Shanghai in accordance with present instructions. (d.) That the use of aircraft, in connection with the defence of Shameen is permitted and that, should the situation necessitate it, the . shelling of vital points in Canton or of the river defences is permitted.That if considerations other than military allow, the Acting Consul-Genera], Canton, should be authorised as proposed in his telegram No. 5 of the 13th January, to inform the General in Command of the Chinese Forces, Canton, that if Shameen is attacked, we shall take such steps as we may think fit, but that the actual nature of such steps should not be specified. Also that discretion should be given to him to arrange for a demonstration over Canton by as many aircraft as can be made available at the moment that this communication is being conveyed to the Chinese General. That if Shameen is attacked, a blockade of Canton and the bombing and shelling of vital points (such as magazines, military establishments, &amp;c.) are among the counter-measures which should be permitted. That immediate authority should be given to the Governor and Naval authorities at Flong Kong for the use of the Kowloon Aerodrome.(Signed) BEATTY.H. TRENCHARD. G. F.
