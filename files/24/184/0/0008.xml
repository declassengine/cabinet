(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos; g Government.)copy; Ho .GOMMTTTEB OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE, CHIEFS OF STAFF SUBCOMMITTEE.THE SITUATION AT CANTON.  JAIIUARY.  1987. Report by the Chiefs of Staff.The Chiefs of Staff Committee were directed bythe Prime Minister to meet to consider the telegramfrom the General Officer Commanding Hong-Kong to the.War Office, No.1279, dated January 13, 1927 (Appendix I)in which is raised the question of the evacuation ofShameen.    We met at short notice on the afternoon ofFriday,  January 14 th.    Sir Victor Welles ley., of theForeign Office, was present for the whole, and SirGilbert Grindie and Mr Glutterbuck of the ColonialOffice -for a part of our meeting.2. Sir Victor Wellesley brought to our attention (Appendix II)telegram Ho.5/from the Acting British Consul-General, Canton, dated January 13,  1987, which is closely connected with the telegram from the General Officer Commanding referred to above, and which we have therefore also taken into consideration.    These tele-grams raise the issue of whether, in the circumstances now prevailing,  the British and French Concessions in Shameen and Canton are to be evacuated or held,S E 0 R E T -CCS .-60.(Also  C.I.D. paper T-To. 759-B.)
and what should be the instructions  to the local authorities on this point.3. We dealt with the smaller Concessionsgenerally in our recant Report on the Situation in China (C,0.3.-59, dated January 11th).    We there pointed out  (para07)  &quot;that the protection of the &quot;smaller Concessions must, as indicated in our first Report. (0.1.Do Paper No.617-B) devolve upon the &quot;Naval Forces.    The Navy, however, cannot, as a &quot;general rule, do more than afford protection against&quot; mob violence.    If it is a question of dealing with&quot;organised military forces evacuation will usually&quot;be the only course&quot;.4, These principles apply generally to the caseof Sharcsen, but there are certain points whichdifferentiate it from most of the other Concessions.Firstly, it is situated on an island in the river,separated by a narrow creek from the mainland;but,  as the creek is usually crowded with small craft, its importance as a militaryobstacle is less than appears at first sight, unless these vessels are cleared away before events areprecipitated.    Secondly,  Shameen is so near to hong-Kong that troops can easily be sent up, andthis course has been followed in the past.    other special considerations are set forth in the following conclusions of the Memorandum- by the General Staffattached to G.I.D. Paper :\TOo722-B, which we quoted in para. 10 of our last Report :,-&quot; (a) Any action taken with regard to Shameen, which involves military consequences, will have to be taken in co-operation with, and with the prior agreement of, the French, who have a definite share in the foreign concession.(b)  The evacuation of Shameen will almost certainly involve its looting and possibly its destruction by the Cantonese.
O 3 (J it(c) The institution of a &quot;blockade without the evacuation of Shameen will almost certainly produce a demand for military protection.    If this demand is to bei met,  a ^arrison of two companies of infantry, with machine guns, and two sections of pack artillery is considered the minimum that could safeguard itself and also the concession.(d) Owing to navigational difficulties, a garrison in Shameen could quite easily be cut off and marooned.(e) If Shameen is cut off from the outside world, a combined naval, military and air operation would have to be undertaken to relieve it.    It is not impossible that-such an operation would land us in extensive commitments.( f)  The operation described in (e) would constitute an r.et of war against China.(g)  Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government is pre-pa red to face the above liabilities,  the evacuation of Shameen should be a necessary preliminary to the institution of a blockade&quot;Our general recommendation in our last Report (para,28 (i)&apos;c)  of 0-O.S.-59.) was that  &quot;The measures to be taken for the protection of Sharoeen or for its evacuation, can only be decided in accordance with the situation at the moment and must b^ left to the men on the spot&quot;,,-^1 $. The present situation, as reported in the telegrams in the Appendices , is as follows;-The local press Is working up an agitation itflifoMgaB^ag over the Incidents at Hankow,      The General Labour Union has held a meeting to discuss taking the Shameen concessions.      The meeting was stopped by the police, but the agitation continues. The Brilleh Acting Consul General and the French Consul have warned the Cantonese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that an attempt by the mob to seize the Island will be repelled by force.      The British Consul General realises, however,  that
this entails firing;  though only in the last extremity, and that then the Cantonese troops might take part.      In that event,  it might be Impossible to evacuate immediately, especially as the French are determined to hold their-concession to the last, and we could not leave them in the lurch.      The Acting Consul General, who thinks the Nationalist Government cannot want- serious trouble at Canton, the base of their campaign and the source of most of their money and supplies, asks for authority to tell the local Chinese General,  in Command,  in as friendly and tactful a manner as possible,  that if we are attacked by troops we shall shell or bomb vital points and finally blockade Cantoiio. In such a case, he thinks the French and possibly the Americans and Japanese, would be with us and help to defend the Islands      Meanwhile, the General Officer Commanding at Hong Kong reports that he has been considering the question    of the Shameen in consultation with the Navy,  and they are of the definite opinion that it should not be evaeuatedj and the Governor concurs in this opinion0      The Navy assure him that communication can be kept open at any time of the year by routes which avoid the defended channels      Should evacuation eventually become imperative,  they consider it highly improbable that these routes would be blocked^      Theif necessary-General Officer- Commanding is pre pa red./to send one Company and four machine guns to Shameen.-     In that event, the Navy propose to block the entrance t&apos;-j) the   river with the &quot;Hermes&quot; and one cruiser, the former being used for bombing if desirable..
o ft       I1160 The reported intention of the French to hold their concession to the last is a new factor.        The Foreign Office are ratherl!doubtful as to the accuracy of this report;Iand are in communication with the French- government on the subjecto      In regard to thismatter we can only point out the greatimportance of concerting our arrangements withthe French-, both between the Governments and the local authorities concerned.7. In dealing with the actual proposals of the acting Consul-rt-eneral and the local Naval andMilitary authorities, we base our  recommendations on the assumption that the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is to avoid any action which might precipitate hostilities with the  Chinese militaryforces and so unite the whole of China in a war -against us,  but that at the sane  time Britishinterests, wherever situated In China, must be protected up to the point where further resistancewill inevitably result in open hostilities withChinese troops .3.    We feel that the threat which the ActingConsul-General proposes  to make to the localChinese General-in-Command at Canton,  if translated into action, would be calculated to precipitatehostilities  and might hasten the crisis at  Shanghaiwhich it is  desired to avert or in any ease to postpone as long as possible.    In these circumstances we think that the threat should not be made.9. The report that it would be possible to keepopen communication between Hong-Kong and Shameenat any time of the year by alternative routes whichavoid  the necessity of forcing the defended mainriver channel is of considerable importance, insomuch
G 1 0 *as this shows that the view of the late Commodore in this respect is confirmed by his successor.    In these c1rcumstances we feel bound to acept the opinion of the ran on the spot.    This in no way modifies  the opinion expressed by the General Staff in G.I.D, Paper No. 7S3-B, quoted abor e in para.3, that if Shameen is cut off from the outside world a combined Naval, Military and Air operation would have to be undertaken to relieve it,  but decreases the probability of this contingency.    Wo think it not impossible, however,  that the Cantonese Govem-men t may have obtained some mines for use in the river.    In general we think that this information is of importance to the local Naval, Military and Consular authorities in deciding their action in such circumstances as may arise, rather than as affecting the principles which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should lay down &apos;po.r their guidance.10. We recommend that the instructions to *-he local Naval, Military and Civil authorities should be guided by the following principles:-(l)  The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to avoid becoming engaged in active hostilities with the Chinese military forces,  since this might unite the whole of China in a war against us.    They must,  therefore, avoid action calculated to precipitate-tat-e this contingency.(s)  Subject to this paramount consideration, the Concessions  are to be protected against mob violence to the utmost extent possible with the forces available locally, but.,  if the continued occupation of the Concessions Is
Q Q 00impossible without action calculated to involve hostiiitie s with the Chinese forces, the men on the spot must have full discretion to evacuate.11.     We recognise that these instructions place a heavy responsibility on those who have to &quot;take a decision, whether to hold on or to evacuate.,      Their position in this respect is similar to that of an officer commanding a rearguard, where the enemy&apos;s advance guard consists of the mob and the main body is the Cantonese armye      They must therefore be given wide discretion,,12.     Subject to the above, and to the consent of the Governor, we re com-: end that the General Officer Commanding at Hong Kong, in consultation with the local Naval authorities and the acting Consul-General at Canton, should be authorised,  if  the situation becomes serious, to send to Shameen such troops as he thinks necessary and as he can spare, having due regard to the security of Hong Kong and to the call which may at any moment arise from Shanghai for the despatch of the India n Battaliono13.      we cannot recommend, however, that authority should be given to block the entrance to the river, as proposed, much less the bombing of Canton, at present.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 14th January,  1927 o.

We are of definite opinion it should not be evacuated and Governor concurs in this opinion.    Navy assure me it would be possible to keep communication open at any time of year via following alternative routes Moneypenny Creek and Hamilton and Lupu Creek.    Should it eventually become imperative to evacuate this could be carried out via same routes.    Navy are of opinion possibility of these three routes being clocked water highly improbable.    Considered by both. Navy and myself unnecessary to attempt to force main river channel via Boooa and. Dane Island forts.    If situation becomes serious I am prepared to send one British company and four machine guns to  Shameen,    Navy propose in such event to block entrance to river with HERMES and one cruiser, former used for bombing if considered, desirable.   Marines for boat guards on lines of communication would also be provide! by Navy,w$*^^*liF\.m-&apos;&apos;Jfk-j&amp;^iBB________&apos;* ftM ^JCM^W &apos;     1..........&quot;.....v&apos;      *   *  I............c i&apos;-^^f^^K^-Wii^.......____________i m - * sMMteti&amp;m \___y--* t- -* ._____* ........

I would make a. oommunioa-tion in as friendly and tactful a manner as possible, but if nationalist government see we e-.ro prepared to take strong action here where it can be taken, it will help &quot;negotiations
