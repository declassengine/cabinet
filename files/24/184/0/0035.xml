THISJXjCUiviENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 OTErffiEW.Copy Ho.      *J CABINET. -&apos;-BSC^ET. TRADE UNIONS    -    POLITICAL LEVY.Memorandum by the Minister of La bear.1. In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision,(Cab.Council 65(26) 6  (c)),  I circulate herewith information showing how far members of Trade Unions have contracted out of the Political Levy.2. Registered and unregistered Unions have power, under theTrade Union Act, 1915, to collect contributions for expenditure on political objects, but the Registrar of Friendly Societies only receives returns from registered Unions,  so that there is no information available as to the number of members of unregis-tered Unions who have claimed exemption.      I attach, however, a list of unregistered Unions which have power to levy their members for political purposes.3. With regard to registered Unions- the information showsthat 111 Unions out of a total of 489 in existence at the end of 1925, have established political funds.    The total membership of these 111 Unions at the end of 1925 was 5,326,626  (including 2--Unions of Employers with a total membership of 6,197) compared with the total membership of the 489 Unions of Employees of 4,447,652.    Out of the membership of 3,326,626 of the 111 Unions the total number of members who claimed exemption from contributing to the political fund at 51st December, 1925, was approximately 111,000,  a percentage of 3.3.      With regard to individual Unions, the percentage of members claiming exemption varied from 0 to 83.6.
9Q9I     i I o hi4. The total amount of the political levy collected by the registered Unions for the year ending 31st December-, 1925, was  154,490. The amount collected by the unregis- -tered unions is not l-cnown.(Intd)   A. S-IMinistry of Labour-. February, 1927.
