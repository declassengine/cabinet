Until October 1926, its headquarters were at Canton, where it set up a serai-Bolshevik Government which is under the influence of the Soviet Government; the Nationalist &quot;capital&quot; was transferred to Hankow about December 1926.      In the North, General Peng Yu Hsiang was recently admitted to the party.NORTHERN.ANFU.This is merely a pro-Japanese clique.    It has no great power at present.      The head is Tuan Chi-jul, who was President of the Republic in 1925.OHIHLI.A. military party which has held office in Peking..     The party is Nationalist in tendency, but strongly anti-Bolshevik.       Wu Pei Fu and Sun Chuan Fang are among its leaders,FENGTIEN.    (The Chinese name for Mukden),Chang Tso Lin&apos;s party, At present in power in Peking. Strongly anti-Bolshevik and largely in the hands of Japan,Territorially, the distribution of the parties is as follows :-NATIONALIST.This party controls all China south of the Yangtze except Yunnan, Shanghai, and part of Chekiang,    It also controls Ransu and Shensi in the North-west, and is in direct communication with Soviet Russia by motor service across the Gobi desert and Mongolia: also Hupeh - astride the Yangtze - and a part of Szechwan.NORTHERN.Between them the Northern parties control the remainder of China (including Manchuria) North of the Yangtze,NOTE.     Mongolia may be looked upon as an independent State under Soviet authority.    In January 1927 the attitude of Szechwan province was uncertain.     The attitude of Tibet has no bearing on the present issue.
