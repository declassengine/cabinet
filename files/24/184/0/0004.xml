[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. ]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   January 1927.SECRET.Copy No.   511C.0.S. 59.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 756-B.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.SITUATION IN CHINA, JANUARY 1927.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.1. THE Chiefs of Staff Committee have been instructed by the Prime Minister to examine the situation in China in the light of recent events. For this purpose we held a meeting on the 11th January, 1927, which was attended by Mr. G. A. Mounsey, C.M.G., O.B.E., of the Foreign Office, and by Captain W. J. C. Lake, R.N., who had recently returned from the China Station. As a starting point in our examination we have taken the Report which we submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 25th June, 1925 (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B), the Conclusions of which have sufficient bearing on the present situation to deserve quotation in full: &quot; (a.) The military significance of the present unrest in China lies rather in the promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in the future than in any present danger.&quot; (&amp;.) In the event of threats to or attacks on the Legation or other British interests in Pekin or Tientsin, no British military force other than the one battalion at Tientsin is available. The first reinforcement which could arrive would be one brigade from India; this could reach Taku in about five weeks from the date of the order to mobilise. During this period of five weeks reliance would have to be placed on international action.&quot; (c.) British interests in the Treaty ports are already receiving such protection as is possible from the naval forces in the Far East, and no protection can be provided other than by the naval forces, which we recommend should be increased.&quot; (d.) British interests inland can receive no protection unless they are on the navigable rivers. Missionaries and isolated individuals, if threatened, should be withdrawn to the ports.&quot; (e.) Modern gunboats should be provided for use on the rivers in China.&quot; (/.) An increase in our military forces in the Far East is desirable, so that a small reserve may be available to meet emergencies such as the present. (In the body of the Report we suggested that the reinforcements should consist as a minimum of an additional British and an additional Indian battalion at Hong-Kong.)&quot; (g.) For the reasons given in the Joint Note circulated with this Report (see annexure*) offensive action in China on a large scale is not possible for the British Empire acting alone, and finality could not be hoped for from any operation within our capacity. Offensive action on a large scale can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must be the predominant partner.&quot;Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.* Vide Annexure to C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B.[15645]is
2. In introducing this Report to the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Chief of the Naval Staff made the following comments :  &quot; Lord Beatty said that as the defence of British interests in China had always been mainly a Naval responsibility, the situation in that country was of greater importance to the Admiralty than to the other Services. If it was correct to assume that the situation in China was so grave that an upheaval similar to the Bolshevik upheaval in Russia might take place, then it was inconceivable that any of the military measures recommended in the Report, such as the despatch of one Brigade from India, would be of any use; in fact, it would probably be harmful, in that it would be calculated to incite Chinese feeling against Great Britain. If military operations in China were to be undertaken, Japan was the only Power in a position to undertake such operations, and though this raised a question of big imperial policy beyond his own province, he personally was inclined to think it advisable, if the situation in China were going to deteriorate to a great extent, to ask Japan to take such action.&apos;&apos;The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended that in the circumstances then existing no reinforcements of the troops in Hong-Kong should take place, although the General Staff were asked to enquire into the cost of accommodation. (See Minutes of 202nd Meeting, held on the 22nd July, 1925.)3. In March 1926, in again reviewing the situation in China in the light of the disturbed conditions which then existed at Canton (C.I.D. Paper No. 677-B), we invited attention to the provisions of our earlier Report quoted above (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B).4. Since that time, considerable naval reinforcements have been sent to the China Station, including the aircraft carrier &quot;Hermes,&quot; but the new gun-boats will not be ready before the autumn.On the 15th December, 1926, it was decided to send a military reinforcement of one British battalion from Gibraltar, which is due to arrive on the 4th February. 1927. In the meantime, the Indian battalion at Hong Kong is held ready at short notice to proceed to Shanghai, and may leave at any&apos;moment.THE PRESENT  SITUATION.5. In the last few months the situation has very much deteriorated. The further and serious disturbances which we apprehended in June 1925 have arisen. The Nationalist Government, working to a considerable extent under Bolshevist influence, has obtained control of the greater part of China south of the Yangtse. Two of the British Concessions on the Yangtse (Hankow and Kiukiang) have been evacuated.   Shanghai is menaced in the near future.       ;It is to the safety of the British and foreign Concessions, and more especially to that of Shanghai, that we address ourselves mainly in this Report.6. Our first Report on this subject (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B) contained a list of the Treaty Ports in China, which number 49 in all. The only Ports, however, to which attention need be drawn at the present time are the following, at which British Concessions exist : Amoy, Canton, Chinkiang, Hankow, Kiukiang, Shanghai, Tientsin.THE  SMALLER  CONCESSION PORTS.7. Leaving the important question of Shanghai to be dealt with later in this Report, we wish to point out that the protection of the smaller Concessions must, as indicated in our first Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B) devolve upon the Naval Forces. The Navy, however, cannot as a general rule do more than afford protection against mob violence. If it is a question of dealing with organised military forces evacuation will usually be the only course. Hankow and Kiukiang, as already mentioned, have been evacuated and are in the occupation of the Chinese Nationalist Forces. Even if, as Eugene Chen appears to wish, these Concessions are returned to their proper owners, we could not recommend any plans based on the assumption that they can be defended against the Nationalist Forces or against anything more than mob violence.
8. Taking the remainder of the minor Concession Ports mentioned above in order, the situation at each is as follows : A moy.9. The principal part of the Concession is, we are informed, situated on an island and is easily defensible. We were informed by Captain Lake that if a company of infantry could be spared from Hong Kong it might be able to hold this Concession. We have not, however, sufficient local knowledge to make a definite recommendation on this subject, and we think that the arrangements at Amoy had best be left to the Naval Commander-in-chief in consultation with the military authorities at Hong Kong, and the local Consular representative.Canton.10. The situation in regard to the defence of the Shameen, where the foreign Concessions at Canton are situated, are fully set forth in a Memorandum by the General Staff attached to C.I.D. Paper No. 722-B, the conclusions of which are summarised in the last paragraph as follows : (a.) Any action taken with regard to Shameen, which involves military consequences, will have to be taken in co-operation with, and with the prior agreement of, the French, who have a definite share in the foreign concession.(b.) The evacuation of Shameen will almost certainly involve its looting and possibly its destruction by the Cantonese.&quot; (c.) The institution of a blockade without the evacuation of Shameen will almost certainly produce a demand for military protection. If this demand is to be met, a garrison of two companies of infantry, with machine guns, and two sections of pack artillery is considered the minimum, that could safeguard itself and also the concession.&quot; (d.) Owing to navigational difficulties, a garrison in Shameen could quite easily be cut off and marooned.&quot; (e.) If Shameen is cut off from the outside world, a combined naval, military and air operation would have to be undertaken to relieve it. It is not impossible that such an operation would land us in extensive commitments.&quot; (/.) The operation described in (e) would constitute an act of war against China.&quot; (g.) Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to face the above liabilities, the evacuation of Shameen should be a necessary preliminaiy to the institution of a blockade.&quot;Chinkiang.11. At Chinkiang there is one British destroyer. An American destroyer is also stationed there, whilst at Nanking, which is about 50 miles higher up the River, there are two British cruisers and one more British destroyer. These ships could provide a landing party of about 300 rifles. This force should be sufficient for the maintenance of order against the local population, but in the event of the arrival of Chinese Nationalist troops the concession might, in circumstances similar to those which arose at Hankow and Kiukiang, have to be evacuated.Tientsin.12. In our earlier Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B) we stated that the inter-national forces at Tientsin amounted to 138 officers and 2,978 other ranks, including British forces of 24 officers and 673 other ranks. We have not had time to check these figures in detail, but we have no reason to suppose that they have altered materially. The original purpose of these forces was to protect the Concession at Tientsin, to keep open communications with the Legations at Pekin, and to provide guards at those Legations. We doubt if they would be able to achieve this object in any grave circumstances.The said forces are sufficient only for the maintenance of order in times of popular disturbance, and would be in a position of grave danger if exposed to attack by a large organised Chinese force. Co-operation by ships at Tientsin is not practicable. The only source from which reinforcements could be obtained at-Tientsin is Japan.[15645] b 2
13. Before passing on to the larger question of Shanghai, we wish to point out that in cases where evacuation of minor concession ports is necessary, the Navy will undertake the arrangements.Events at Hankow and Kiukiang have shown how difficult it is to decide the moment when mere mob violence is likely to develop into an attack by the military forces of the Chinese Nationalist Government. The presence of military forces and the use of firearms for the maintenance of order may precipitate a serious (conflict. In these circumstances, we think that the moment of evacuation, or of preparation for evacuation, must be left to the men on the spot.SHANGHAI.14. The most difficult part of the problem which confronts us at this moment is the protection of our interests at Shanghai. If this cannot be arranged by diplomatic methods, it may be necessary to resort to force. Our Secretary informs us that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed the wish that we should approach this subject on the assumption that Shanghai is to be held in all circumstances. In view of the vastness of the British and international interests at stake we agree that this is the only point of view from Avhich the subject can be approached.15. Although no definite information is available, we estimate that Shanghai is liable to attack by Nationalist armies up to a strength of 80,000 men, with artillery and aeroplanes. The precise fighting value to be placed on these forces is difficult to determine, but is certainly not high. These forces, according to local reports, might reach Shanghai any time after the 22nd January. The only existing forces at Shanghai are the Municipal Police and the Shanghai Volunteers, believed to number over 2,000, but arrangements have been made to despatch the Indian Battalion from Hong Kong if required, and it is understood that arrange-ments are being made with the other Treaty Powers to bring the total reinforcements up to 4,000 men. No further British reserves are available nearer than India, whence troops could not arrive within less than six to eight weeks from the date of the order. When the whole of this reinforcement of 4,000 men has been assembled, we cannot regard the total force available as more than sufficient, in the first instance, for the purpose of maintaining order amid a possibly hostile population of over 1,000,000. For guarding the large perimeter of Shanghai against attack by the Chinese Nationalist Army, considerably larger forces would be required, which we estimate as at least one Division and a Squadron of aircraft over and above, the force required for the maintenance of order.16. We wish to emphasize that it is impossible for Great Britain to under-take the defence of the Settlement single-handed. As the dates we have given show, it is impracticable to transport sufficient British reinforcements before the possible date of arrival of the Chinese Nationalist Army. Even if it were possible we should greatly deprecate isolated action except as the very last resort, as it would inevitably involve us in a war in which, in all probability, the whole of China would be united against us, with disastrous results to our vast interests throughout the East.17. In these circumstances we attach the first importance to the organisation of international action. Moreover, such action must be prompt if Shanghai is to be saved by military means. As mentioned in our Report of June 1925 (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B), there is only one nation which can send large forces to China at short notice, and that is Japan. Whether Japan&apos;s appreciation of the importance of international solidarity in China is sufficiently strong to induce her to undertake the principal share in the defence of- Shanghai, where British interests predominate, is a matter on which we offer no opinion. If, however, an appeal is made to Japan, we recommend that the British Government should simultaneously offer to send its share of the international contingent, even though it cannot arrive until a later stage. We think also that the French and the United States Governments should also send their quotas, and, so far as we are able to judge from recent telegrams, they are not unfavourably disposed in this matter.18. On the basis of a total force of one division, the British and American quotas should each amount to a mixed brigade, and the Japanese, owing to their
proximity to the scene of action, might be asked to send two brigades. It is of great importance that the Japanese contingent should be despatched at the. earliest possible moment.19.   We attach great importance to the appointment of a Commander-in-Chief-of the international force, and if, as we recommend, Japan is to be the predominant partner, the command should be vested in a Japanese Officer.20. Up to now we have been treating the matter from a purely military point of view vis-a-vis the Nationalist Army. We cannot, however, ignore some political considerations which weigh heavily upon the military position. To judge exactly what the reaction of the arrival of large military forces at Shanghai will be upon the situation in China, is beyond our province. We understand, however, that up to now the advance of the Chinese Nationalist forces has been accompanied by an accession to their strength. They may even be joined by Sun&apos;s army, estimated at 60,000 men, which is now ostensibly defending Shanghai against the Nationalists. Some portions of this army are reported already to have deserted to their enemy. Further, we are not in a position to judge whether or to what extent the resistance of Shanghai may be accompanied by a spontaneous outbreak of anti-foreign movements in other parts of China and by organised action for the recovery of the Concession at Tientsin similar to that taken on the Yangtse. We have no doubt that a purely British resistance at Shanghai would produce the most serious conse-quences to British interests in China. Possibly, however, the, Nationalist Govern-ment may pause before taking such action as would unite a large part of the world against them.21. Another danger which, perhaps, cannot altogether be excluded is that the Chinese Nationalists, on approaching Shanghai, may try to follow the same course, mutatis mutandis, which they adopted at Hankow. There is, however, at Shanghai no separate British Concession like that at Hankow, and British interests, being dispersed throughout the International Settlement, cannot be isolated and marked out for special treatment as distinct from those of the other Powers. Nevertheless, it is possible that the Chinese Nationalists might make the British defending forces their main objective. We are informed, however, that at Shanghai in the past, while the French have confined their activities to the safeguarding of their own interests, the Japanese and Americans have co-operated with us in taking joint action.A third risk is that, in the event of a serious resistance being offered by the Powers at Shanghai, the Chinese Nationalist Government might turn their attention towards Canton and Hong Kong.22. We recognise that the magnitude of our interests at Shanghai and the reaction of a disaster there on our interests and prestige in other parts of China and of the whole East may be such as to compel us to an active defence. We admit the possibility also that by showing a bold front at Shanghai we may stop the rot. But we feel bound to point out that our attitude may lead to a war, the consequences and magnitude of which cannot be foreseen. From our point of view, the only advantage to be gained from such a war is the upholding of our Treaty rights, the retention of what we already hold and the maintenance of our prestige in the East. Japan, however, may have more to gain, and it is on Japan that we should have to rely to carry the main burden.SUGGESTED MILITARY RESERVE IN THE FAR EAST.23. All these considerations lead us to repeat and emphasize the desirability urged in our Report of June 1925 (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B), in favour of permanent increase in our military forces in the Ear East so that a small reserve may be available to meet emergencies. The arrangement whereby a large propor-tion of the Infantry garrison of Singapore is to be transported from India on or just before the outbreak of hostilities, contravenes a principle rigidly adhered to before the War whereby the garrisons of defended ports abroad were maintained in time of peace at war strength. By an increase in the number of troops stationed at Singapore we should at one and the same time increase the security of the Naval Base and provide a small reserve available for emergencies in the Far East such as the present.
24. In this connection we would point out that the Governor of the Straits Settlements opposed the withdrawal of even so small a force as two Companies of Infantry at the present time, owing to the possible repercussion on the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States of events in China.25. In present conditions the only emergency reserve existing in the Far East is in India. The cost of obtaining troops from India is so great that we think this source should only be drawn upon in the last resort. They may not always be available.ECONOMIC  PRESSURE.26. At an earlier stage of the development of events in China, on our recommendation, the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade reported on the value of a blockade of Canton (C.I.D. Paper No. 681-B).27. Our attention has been drawn to telegrams from China indicating that already the Chinese Nationalist Government is apprehensive in regard to the economic pressure which can be exerted by British banks. We recommend that the Trading and Blockade Committee should be assembled at once to report on all the possibilities of economic pressure on the Nationalist Government of China in the conditions which now exist, whether by international action or, in the last resort, by the British alone. Although British action perhaps deserves examination in case we may be driven to it, we would emphasise the great importance of securing international co-operation in any steps that may be taken to bring economic pressure to bear.CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS. 28.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : (1.) The Smaller Concession Ports: The protection of the smaller Concessions must, as indicated in our first Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 617-B) devolves upon the Naval Forces. The Navy, however, can only afford protection against mob violence. If it is a question of dealing with military forces evacuation will usually be the only course.(2.) As regards the particular ports, our conclusions are as follows : (a.) Hankow and Kiukiang. Even if these Concessions are returned to their proper owners, we do not recommend any plans based on the assumption that they can be defended against Chinese Nationalist forces or against anything more than mob violence.(b.) Amoy. The arrangements for the protection of the Concession of Amoy should be left to the Naval Commander-in-Chief in consultation with the Military authorities and the local Consular representative.(c.) Canton. The problem as to the defence of the Shameen is as set forth in paragraph 10. Its evacuation should be the necessary preliminary to the institution of a blockade. The measures to be taken for the protection of Shameen or for its evacuation, can only be decided in accordance with the situation at the moment and must be left to the men on the spot.(d.) Chinkiang. At Chinkiang the Naval Forces available are sufficient for the maintenance of order, but in the event of the arrival of Chinese Nationalist troops the Concession might have to be evacuated.(e.) Tientsin.--At Tientsin the Allied Forces are sufficient only for the maintenance of order in times of popular disturbance, and would be in a position of grave danger if exposed to attack by a large organised Chinese force. It is doubtful if they could keep open communications with the Legation at Peking in any grave circumstances. In the event of serious trouble threatening, reinforcements can only be obtained from Japan. Our Naval Forces cannot co-operate, as Tientsin cannot be reached by water.(3.) In cases where evacuation of Concession ports is necessary, the Navy will undertake the arrangements. The moment of evacuation or of prepara-tion for evacuation must be left to the men on the spot, who will act in accordance with the circumstances prevailing at the moment.
(4.) Shanghai.To protect the Concessions at Shanghai by military means against Nationalist troops that might be brought against it in the near future, a force of at least one division and one squadron of aeroplanes would be necessary, and would have to be despatched without delay. This should be an international force, with a preponderance of Japanese, and commanded by a Japanese Officer, in view of the fact that Japan alone can provide large forces at short notice. In the present circumstances we must in fact rely primarily on Japan to protect our interests in Shanghai. Owing to the magnitude of British interests, British participation on the scale of a mixed brigade, with a proportion of naval aircraft, although it may be late, is essential. These forces should be additional to those required to control the population.Such steps for the protection of Shanghai might involve war with China, the consequences of which cannot be foreseen.(5.) Military Reserve in the Far East.The present situation clearly shows the necessity for a strategic military reserve in the Far East, which, we think, should be at Singapore.(6.) Economic Pressure.It is recommended that the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade should be assembled at once to report-on all the possibilities of economic pressure on the Nationalist Government of China, whether by international action or in the last resort by the British alone.(7.) General.The importance of securing international co-operation in any action against China, whether economic or military, cannot be too strongly emphasised.BEATTY.G. F. MILNE.H.
