Copy No.    30SECRET.CP. 48 (27).CABINET.COLONIAL OFFICE CONFERENCE, 1927.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I HAVE been considering for some time past the possibility of holding a Conference in London, to be attended by Governors and senior officials of the non-self-governing Colonies, Protectorates, and Mandated Territories, at which questions of mutual interest could be discussed and measures devised to facilitate co-ordination in matters of common concern to the several Governments of the Dependent Empire.As the result of the replies from Colonial Governments which I have received to a telegram sent on the 24th December, I have now decided to summon a Conference for May next.This Conference (which will be called the Colonial Office Conference) will be of an experimental nature, and its primary object will be to explore the desirability of holding Colonial Conferences of a more comprehensive nature at fixed intervals, and to consider the possibility of setting up any other machinery to secure more effective co-operation between Colonial Governments in matters of general administra-tion, economic development, and scientific and technical research.Apart from these general questions, I have formulated provisional agenda as a basis for discussion (vide Annex).The Conference will open in the first week in May, and I anticipate that it will last for about three weeks. So far as is known at present about twenty Colonies and Protectorates will be represented.My intention is to keep this Conference on as informal a footing as possible, and I do not propose to make any elaborate arrangements for it or to give it much in the way of publicity, though an announcement that it is to be held will be made in -due course. The preliminary agenda are being communicated by the Colonial Office to other Government Departments concerned, and their assistance will be sought in the preparation of any necessary memoranda.L. S.
